Rising star Will Keane is determined to make his mark as new
manager Louis Van Gaal assesses his playing personnel on their American Tour, the striker told Manchester
United’s official website.

The Reds have defeated LA Galaxy 7-0 and AS Roma 3-2 so far
on their US tour and are preparing to meet Inter Milan in midweek as the
squad are put through their paces for the new season.

Van Gaal is striving to implement a new system and
philosophy, which is a testing time for everybody and Keane realises these matches carry great significance for players to showcase their potential.

Impact: Keane is desperate to prove his worth to the Manchester United squad on the US pre-season tour

'It has been good so far and I’ve enjoyed it,' said the 21-year-old.

'It was good to experience LA as it was my first time there.
It’s my first pre-season tour and lots of fans have come out to see the
players, which shows you just how big the club is. We’ve done a few
appearances, which I’ve enjoyed as well.

'Training has been intense but good and everyone is trying
to take on board what the manager wants. He knows it’s going to be a long
process but everybody’s giving their all.

Intense: training under new boss Louis Van Gaal has been tough but Keane is relishing the challenge

'Everybody wants to work as hard as possible and training is
serious – we know we have a job to do. We’ve come over here and we want to win
as many games as possible.

'We’ve been working very hard on the shape and
structure of the team and want to deliver what the manager asks for.

'The players always enjoy the ‘boxes’ that we play after
warming up, when there are a couple of players in the middle. It’s serious but
also a bit of fun and everyone gets a touch of the ball.

'If you nutmeg someone in the middle it’s always a laugh,
but you’re still working hard at the same time.'

Time to reflect: Van Gaal (right) has two more pre-season matches in the US to assess his United squad before the season starts in three weeks

Keane made his senior United debut as a substitute in a 3-2
defeat to Blackburn at Old Trafford in December 2011.

However, after rupturing a cruciate ligament in his knee
while playing for England Under-19s in June 2012, Keane missed 16 months of
football on the sidelines.

Having recovered the 21-year-old is pleased to be granted a
chance to make his mark after spending last season on loan in the Championship,
firstly at Wigan, before helping QPR gain promotion to the Premier League in
May.

'Once a new manager comes in, it’s a fresh start for
everyone,' he stated.

'The manager has a great track record and has said players’
experience is not just based on age; it’s about taking responsibility whether
you’re young or old.

'And if you’re doing the job he wants you to do, he gives
you the confidence that you’ll get an opportunity.’
