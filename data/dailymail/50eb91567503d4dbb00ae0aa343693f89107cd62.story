The number of people forced from their homes by conflict and persecution has passed 50million in a year for the first time since the Second World War.

Some 51.2million sought shelter last  year – the equivalent of almost the entire population of England.

The figure, revealed by the United Nations, is up six million from 2012, largely due to Syrians fleeing civil war.

The UN’s high commissioner for refugees, Antonio Gutteres, said: ‘These numbers represent a quantum leap in forced displacement around the world. For the first time since the Second World War, we had in 2013 more than 50million people displaced by conflict and persecution either crossing borders or within the borders of their countries.’

Some 16.7million of the total had crossed their own nation’s borders. By the end of last year, 2.5million Syrians had become refugees in neighbouring countries while more than 6.5million had been displaced within Syria.

The latest figures do not include the half million people believed to have fled violence in Iraq over the past week.

The massive increase was mainly driven by Syria's civil war. By the end of last year, 2.5 million Syrians had become refugees in neighboring countries and more than 6.5 million had been displaced within Syria, the U.N. agency said.

The daunting numbers — which are straining the resources of host countries and aid organizations alike — also are a stark reflection of the ongoing conflicts and persecution in other countries, including the Central African Republic and South Sudan.

'These numbers represent a quantum leap in forced displacement around the world,' Guterres said.

'For the first time since the second world war, we had in 2013 more than 50 million people displaced by conflict and persecution either crossing borders or within the borders of their countries.'

Aid agencies have struggled to keep pace with worsening conflicts in Syria, the Central African Republic and South Sudan, and on Friday the World Food Program, a U.N. agency, said it was forced to cut rations to refugees in several countries.

For the first time since the World War II era, the number of people forced from their homes worldwide has surged past 50 million

'We are being squeezed, other U.N. agencies are increasingly squeezed, NGOs are squeezed,' spokesman Peter Smerdon told The Associated Press.

'This means that ultimately the poor, the most vulnerable, the innocent civilians who have escaped conflicts with their lives and reached refuge in a country which is at peace, they will suffer because their assistance cannot be delivered.'

The over-50-million number includes refugees and asylum-seekers who fled abroad as well as people displaced within their own countries. The data was compiled from government, non-government partner organizations and UNHCR's own records.

Theirs was one of the three worst-affected nations, along with Afghanistan and Somalia. The UN also highlighted the ongoing conflicts and persecutions in other countries including the Central African Republic and South Sudan.

The nations hosting the most refugees were Pakistan, Iran and Lebanon, whose stability is increasingly under threat as the Syrian war continues.

More than a million Syrians have registered in Lebanon as refugees since the conflict began in 2011; they now comprise nearly a quarter of the country’s population.
