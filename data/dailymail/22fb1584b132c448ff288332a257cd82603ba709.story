A woman caught up in the Algerian hostage crisis in which dozens died today described her daring escape - and her terrible fear that she would be raped.

The French nurse, who asked to be described solely by her first name of Muriel, said that she 'refused to give up to terrorists'.

In a deeply moving interview, Muriel said: 'At best, I'd get a bullet in the head straight away. At worst, as a woman - well, I don't need to draw you a picture.'

Lucky: Mr Balmaceda said he survived a bomb blast that killed nine hostages on a van because he was sadnwiched between two tyres

On the first day of the crisis last 
Wednesday she heard a security alarm sounding as up to 40 al-Qaeda 
gunmen began to over-run the BP-run In Amanas BP gas installation, in 
south east Algeria.

Muriel 
and three male colleagues immediately hid in their living quarters, 
despite some thinking they should run away from the heavily armed 
Islamists.

'Two of us wanted to try and get out, the two others said it was safer to stay,' Muriel told Paris's Europe 1 radio station.

But
after hours of hiding away in terrified silence, Muriel suggested to 
her fellow workers that it was time to get out of the complex.

'I told them we had to take our chance,' said Muriel. 'You can't submit to them, otherwise you are giving in to the terrorists.

'Even
with a little act, saying to yourself they are trying to capture me but
I won't let them succeed, you regain your identity,' she said.

'These people were ready to commit any kind of barbaric act but I succeeded in thwarting them.'

Using a pair of pliers which Muriel found in an ambulance on site, the escapees cut through a perimeter fence.

They then disappeared into the desert, constantly fearing that the terrorists would capture them.

She admitted she feared the worst as the noise of explosions and gunfire filled the air.

Muriel
knew that being French made her a particular target because the 
terrorists were trying to get French forces to pull out of neighboring 
Mali, where an anti-terrorism war is currently taking place.

'I
said to myself they cannot find me, I am a women and I am French. With 
what is happening in Mali they'll kill me immediately,' said Muriel.

'We
stayed hidden in the office for hours, jumping out of our skin at every
little noise. Every time we heard someone in the corridor, we said 
"that's it, the terrorists are coming to get us".

'It
was our good fortune that they didn't come and search where we were, in
a little corner out of the way. But for those left behind it was really
awful.'

It is not clear how many woman work at the plant, but BP told MailOnline that none of its 18 employees were female.

The British firm said 14 staff had returned home safely, two had been killed and two were still unaccounted for.

One-eyed fugitive: Mokhtar Belmokhtar, an Algerian who fought against Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s, has reportedly claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of up to 41 foreigners at an Algerian gas field

Armed to the teeth: The terrorists' weapons, recovered by Algerian special forces, included six machine guns, 21 rifles, two mortars with shells, two rocket-propelled grenade launchers and ten explosive belts

Meanwhile, another hostage has told how Islamic
militants used their captives as human shields to stop Algerian 
helicopters from strafing them with gunfire.

Father-of-four
Joseph Balmaceda said he saw one Japanese hostage draped with 
explosives, while he and others had their hands bound with cable ties 
during the ordeal at the In Amenas gas plant in the Sahara Desert.

'Whenever
government troops tried to use a helicopter to shoot at the enemy, we 
were used as human shields,' the Filipino said shortly after arriving 
back in Manila.

'We were told to raise our hands. The government forces could not shoot at them as long as we were held hostage.'

Balmaceda, nursing abrasions to his 
face and a loss of hearing, said he was the only survivor out of nine 
hostages who were aboard a van that exploded, apparently from C-4 
explosives that the militants had rigged to the vehicle.

He said two militants were 
transferring the nine hostages to the central facility of the gas plant,
but the bomb went off during a clash with Algerian security forces.

'The only thing left of the car was the back portion of the Land Cruiser,' said Balmaceda, 42.

'I
was the only one who survived because I was sandwiched between two 
spare tyres. That is why I am still here and can talk to you.'

Balmaceda said the two militants driving the vehicle were also killed.

'But (other) hostage-takers were firing at me. It meant there were other terrorists,' he said.

'So
I crawled about 300 metres to where the government forces were. And 
when I reached them I fainted. When I woke up I was in the hospital.'

David Cameron suggested there would be an expansion in British intelligence and special forces in order to combat the terror threat from Africa

The Al-Qaeda-linked 'Signatories in 
Blood' group said it attacked the gas plant in retaliation for a French 
military operation to evict Islamists from neighbouring Mali.

Most hostages were freed on Thursday 
in a first Algerian rescue operation, which was initially viewed by 
foreign governments as hasty, before the focus of public condemnation 
turned on the jihadists.

Balmaceda
said the incident in which the vehicle exploded occurred on the second 
day of the siege, apparently during the first rescue operation.

The crisis ended on Saturday with a final assault by Algerian troops.

Their accounts came as it emerged the siege was orchestrated by a Canadian.

Documents
found on the bodies of two terrorists – one a ringleader – identified 
them as Canadians and Western intelligence agencies were checking last 
night whether either was ‘known’ to them.

Survivors have told how at least one of the kidnappers spoke perfect English in giving them orders.

Both Canadians entered Algeria from Libya with members of the ‘Blood Battalion’ led by Mokhtar Belmokhtar.

Their cars were painted in the colours of the Algerian state energy firm, Sonatrach.

Only part of one of the men’s names –
‘Chedad,’ which is Moroccan – was released yesterday but British 
investigators were seeking to establish whether either Canadian had 
spent time in Britain or had UK links.

The development raises fears that the
Arab Spring has been a rallying call for extremists. Hundreds of 
Britons and Westerners joined the fighting in the Middle East and North 
Africa and some may have subsequently joined violent groups abroad or 
terror gangs back home.

Significantly, a Briton who is 
believed to be an Islamic convert in his late 20s with blond hair and 
blue eyes is said to have joined one-eyed Belmokhtar’s group last year. 
He is reported to have visited wounded jihadists at a hospital in 
south-east Mali.

And a second British jihadist linked 
to the terror leader is said to be a Londoner, who was captured by the 
Mauritanian authorities last month trying to cross into Mali.

Investigators say the men are part of
a ‘small but increasing and significant’ number of Britons or foreign 
nationals living in the UK and travelling to join extremist groups with 
loose associations to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.

It is thought Britons and other Europeans may have attended terror camps in the Sahel region to the south of the Sahara.

The Canadian link has long been 
feared, according to David Harris of the terrorist intelligence 
programme at Insignis Strategic Research in Ottawa.

He said the country’s open borders 
and dual language made it attractive to French-speaking immigrants from 
North Africa. French anti-terrorism magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière has 
called Montreal a hub of North African terrorism.

Four years ago, a Canadian, Momin 
Khawaja, was jailed for ten years for his part in planning a fertiliser 
bomb plot in Britain for which five people were convicted in the UK.

Khawaja, 33, made numerous trips from his home in Ottawa to London claiming to be seeking a wife.

He was actually helping to plan the attack, which was foiled by British police.

Algeria’s prime minister yesterday 
said 37 foreigners of eight nationalities and one Algerian worker were 
killed during the hostage crisis. At least 29 militants also died.

Abdelmalek Sellal, who strongly 
defended the actions of his special forces in storming the BP plant, 
said the terrorists had worn army uniforms, memorised the layout of the 
vast complex and were intending to blow it up.

The plant, which is vital to the Algerian economy, is expected to resume operations today.

However, a spokesman for BP, which had 18 employees at the plant, said this was unlikely.

He told MailOnline: 'I can't see how that could happen. We are not pushing to get it started. It 's a crime scene from the Metropolitan Police's point of view, so it is not a priority.'

Jihadists yesterday threatened more hostage-taking unless Western powers leave Mali.

Updating MPs in the House of Commons 
yesterday, David Cameron said the process of bringing home the bodies of
the victims was Britain's top priority, but might take some time.
