A benefits cheat who pocketed £20,000 in state hand-outs by claiming he was so disabled he couldn’t walk more than 10 metres was caught by undercover investigators - lifting heavy wheelbarrows and walking his pet dog.

Alan Sheard, 59, told the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) he was entitled to the highest category of disability benefits on the grounds that he was so ill he couldn’t even leave the house.

But he was caught on camera by DWP investigators easily lifting a wheelbarrow into his car boot, pushing wheelie bins along his drive and taking his dog for a walk.

Cheat: Alan Sheard, 59, claimed he was so disabled he couldn't walk more than 10 metres but was spotted easily lifting a wheelbarrow into his car boot

Probe: Sheard was caught on camera by DWP investigators

Claims: Sheard told the Department of Work and Pensions he was entitled to the highest category of disability benefits on the grounds that he was so ill he couldn't even leave the house

Despite saying he couldn’t move without the aid of walking sticks Sheard can be seen in one clip moving a 6ft 7in metal fence to allow his pet dog through to another field while enjoying a leisurely stroll in the park.

Sheard appeared before Wolverhampton Magistrates’ Court on Monday where he pleaded guilty to failing to notify the Government of a change in circumstances.

Magistrates heard he was overpaid a total of £19,985.10 in Disability Living Allowance between May 2009 and June 2012.

Chris Coughlan, prosecuting, said a surveillance operation had been launched following three anonymous tip-offs that Sheard, from Wolverhampton, was doing ‘occasional work’ and playing golf three times a week.

Plea: Sheard appeared before Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court on Monday where he admitted failing to notify the Government of a change of circumstances that affected his entitlement to benefits

Investigation: A surveillance operation had been launched following three anonymous tip-offs that Sheard, from Wolverhampton, was doing 'occasional work' and playing golf three times a week

He added: 'He was filmed walking his dog over long distances, lifting a wheelbarrow, lifting a 6ft by 7ft metal mesh fence panel and manoeuvring wheelie bins.

'Mr Sheard allegedly could not walk in excess of 10 metres and did not go outside.'

Richard Burch, defending, admitted Sheard should have told authorities his condition had improved.

He said: 'He was still disabled and probably would have been entitled to some form of disability allowance, although not at the rate at which he was being paid.

'The defendant still suffers from severe ill health. He suffers from chronic pancreatitis, which means he has difficulty eating.

'He has to take a lot of medications. He is diabetic. He also has a bad back.

Changed man: The court heard Sheard - who appeared in court on crutches - had not received Disability Living Allowance since the matter came to light in 2012

'He is a person who does have considerable medical problems. It is not suggested that there is a matter of dishonesty.'

Mr Burch said that Sheard's form had been completed in 2007 by one of the defendant’s daughters.

'She put basically that the defendant couldn’t really walk without sticks,' he said.

'Occasionally he went to a golf course and he has been seen with a wheelbarrow and walking short distances.

'He did take a dog to a little wooded area near to his house.

'He should have informed the authorities that his walking wasn’t quite as immobile as it was on the form.'

The court heard Sheard - who appeared in court on crutches - had not received Disability Living Allowance since the matter came to light in 2012.

The case was adjourned for reports and he was told to appear before the same court for sentencing next week.
