A motorist drove at speeds of up to 70mph behind a windscreen almost totally obscured in snow.

The unknown person at the wheel of the grey Renault was spotted driving with snow covering the front of the car on the M60 over Barton Bridge in Greater Manchester - to the horror of other drivers.

The driver who captured the footage said he was 'gobsmacked' when the snow-covered car pulled into view behind him in the outside lane of the southbound carriageway, at about 50mph.

A jeep behind the Renault could be seen urgently flashing its headlights in warning. The footage was captured by a motorist who had installed a rear-facing dashcam in his vehicle after an accident.

In total he captured three minutes of footage of the car being driven covered in snow, but said the vehicle drove for longer than that before turning off the M60, sometimes reaching speeds of 70mph.

The driver, who asked not to be identified, has already contacted police to offer them the footage which he captured on Monday.

He said: ‘I installed the dashcam after I had an accident where someone shunted me. I had come on to the M60 from the M62 and was just travelling along when I noticed the car behind.

‘I just thought, “how the blooming heck is that person driving?” They followed me for quite a long way - the video captures three minutes but they were driving like that for longer.

‘I was just absolutely gobsmacked that they could drive - they must have barely been able to see. 

'I do a lot of motorway driving and when you see idiots like that you really feel that you should make people aware of how dangerous it is. It may have been that the snow was on the roof and then it slid down, but they have just driven on with it like that, trying to look through the little slit.

‘They turned off at a junction but before that I'd sped up to 70mph and they were still behind me, driving like that. It is just stupid.’

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said the force would look at the footage when they received it to investigate if a motoring offence had been committed.

The scene was revealed as heavy snow caused travel chaos for commuters across parts of the country, with one car skidding off an icy road and crashing into the front of a house.

Yorkshire, the Midlands and the west coast of Scotland all saw snow overnight, with Leeds Bradford Airport being forced to close. The Met Office said parts of Cumbria had seen 1.6in (4cm) of snow.
