Harry Jones, 20, was found dead in Blackpool, Lancashire last January after taking a concoction of Tramadol painkillers, Valium and alcohol

A babysitter who was addicted to painkillers died in his sleep after taking a concoction of Valium, Tramadol pain relief and alcohol at a notorious drug house, an inquest heard.

Harry Jones, 20, was found dead on the sofa of Sharon Nuttall’s home in Blackpool, Lancashire, after spending the night babysitting her two young children.

An inquest heard the college student, who was an aspiring film producer, was given the Valium by drug dealer Nuttall on the evening of January 13 in last year, but secretly took the Tramadol painkillers after swiping them from her collection while she was out partying.

He was found unconscious the following morning by friends and pronounced dead after attempts to resuscitate him failed.

A coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure at the hearing in Blackpool yesterday, and said it was clear Mr Jones had voluntarily taken the alcohol and medication but hadn’t intended to die as a result.

The inquest came just over a year after mother-of-four Nuttall was sentenced to 18 months in prison for supplying Class B and C drugs and permitting her house to be used for smoking and supplying drugs.

The 41-year-old, whose children at the time were five, seven, 10 and 15, turned her family home into a ‘magnet’ for young people by using it as a drugs den to sell amphetamines, cannabis, prescription drugs and the former legal high ‘bubble’.

Over a three-year period, she allowed up to 20 youngsters into her home at once to take drugs - often introducing them to new tablets and dangerous concoctions.

Following yesterday’s inquest, Mr Jones’ mother, Lorraine, 48, condemned Nuttall for introducing youngsters in the area to drugs and making them so readily available.

The bank worker, from Blackpool, said: ‘There are so many kids’ lives that she ruined from what she was doing.

‘She wasn’t charged directly with Harry’s death but if he had never met her he might not have started on the route he did.

Mr Jones, a Grade A media student who attended Blackpool and The Fylde College, was an aspiring film producer and was in the process of applying to Leeds University at the time of his death in January last year

‘Harry was a good boy but he came across these tablets at her house when he was about 17 and he changed.

‘She was in her 40s with small children and yet she was having 16 and 17-year-olds round her house doing “bubble”. You can’t get your head around how a mother would do something like that.’

Mr Jones, a Grade A media student who attended Blackpool and The Fylde College, was described by his family as ‘the life and soul of parties’.

However, the inquest heard how the student, who was in the process of applying to study at Leeds University at the time of his death, had been battling an addiction to painkillers which even saw him tell doctors that he suffered from severe back pain in order to get repeated prescriptions for painkillers.

Mrs Jones said: ‘From the end of October 2012 to the time of his death he appeared to be ok.

‘He wasn’t going out and had his head down at college and we had a really great Christmas where he was the life and soul as usual.

‘He was saving up to go on holiday. It was always one week at a time with Harry. He had had a really good couple of months.’

However, on the night of his death, he
 went to Nuttall’s house with a friend to babysit her children and, 
despite being armed with two bottles of wine, asked her for a Valium 
tablet.

She gave both Mr Jones and his friend a Valium tablet each before leaving the property and later exchanging text messages with them, after they asked her for more tablets.

The 17-year-old friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, relayed the course of events in a statement read out at the inquest.

It read: ‘Harry came upstairs at about 2.30am and I would describe him as pretty wasted.

‘He told me to get up so I did and went downstairs to watch TV. He was slurring his words and kept talking to himself.

‘He started to root through his pockets and pulled out eight Tramadol with two missing. My friend grabbed them and asked what he was doing with them.

‘He gave them to me and I hid them in the bathroom because I knew he had problems with prescription drugs in the past. At about 4am my friend got up and said he was leaving and I went to sleep.

‘As I left the room Harry was lying 
down on his back on the sofa snoring and asleep. At 11am a friend let 
himself in as the door was open and woke me up and said “Harry looks 
dead”.

‘We both tried to wake him up, shook him and listened to his breathing and then we rang an ambulance.’

Tests revealed Mr Jones was less than twice the legal drink-drive limit at the time of his death and had taken a small amount of Valium. But the level of Tramadol in his system was 'within a range associated with fatalities'

Tests revealed Mr Jones died as a result of a massive ingestion of Tramadol pain relief, which had been prescribed to Nuttall by doctors for back pain, plus Diazepam and alcohol.

In a statement Nuttall said Mr Jones was a ‘good friend’ who she had known since he was 14.

She said that two months before his death she had gone to take Tramadol for her back pain but found they were missing. She confronted him and he admitted taking the medication but apologised.

Speaking about the evening before his death, she said: ‘We all had a drink. At about 11.35pm I went to my boyfriend’s and left Harry and his friend watching TV. When I left he had a couple of glasses of wine and was fine. I told him he could stay over.

Mother-of-four Sharon Nuttall, 41, was sentenced to 18 months in prison last May for supplying Class B and C drugs and permitting her house to be used for smoking and supplying drugs.

At the time, the judge Mr Recorder Stephen Bedford at Preston Crown Court, said: ‘Your house became something of a magnet for young vulnerable people you seem to have been unable to keep away.

‘But such was your priority, was your social life over the welfare of young people in your house - particularly your children - that you left the house that night.

‘I’m looking at you being the adult here, you being the parent at home. Allowing them to behave in this way, not just on a one-off but over a period of time.

‘That must have had some corrupting effect upon them.’

A 17-year old boy who helped Nuttall also admitted to being concerned in the supply of Class B drugs last May and was sentenced to a 12-month youth rehabilitation and supervision order.

‘I did not think he had Tramadol when I left but he texted me several times in the early hours asking about it.

‘I was told in the morning he was deceased. I checked my medication and there was some Tramadol missing. I can’t say exactly how many but about 40 to 60. It’s hard to say the exact number.’

A post-mortem revealed that Mr Jones was less than twice the legal drink-drive limit at the time of his death and had taken just a small amount of Valium.

But the level of Tramadol in his system was ‘within a range associated with fatalities’ and combined with the other factors meant he would have ‘slept into death’.

Coroner Alan Wilson returned a verdict of misadventure and described his death as tragic’.

He said: ‘He was the life and soul of parties - opinionated, outgoing, frustrating - but always caring and loved.

‘He was passionate about meteorology and an animal lover. He was working part time in a hotel on weekends and was saving or a holiday with friends.

‘His friends and family are devastated by tragic death and struggle to come to terms with it. 

'Everyone who knew him remembers his big smile and he will be sorely missed by all whose lives he shared.’

After the hearing Mr Jones’ father, Darren, 48, paid tribute to his son and said he would’ve excelled in his dream job of being a film producer.

The double glazing installer said: ‘At Christmas he had everyone in stitches. He would have been perfect in front of the camera but he was brilliant behind it.

‘He was amazing at everything he turned his hand to.’
