When Germany takes to the Estádio Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday to take on Argentina in the World Cup Final, all eyes will be on the pitch as millions wait to see whether Messi's men can triumph over Mesut Özil and co.

But for a select group of women, the match will be an altogether more personal affair as they cheer on their husbands and boyfriends from the stands and prepare to celebrate or commiserate come the final whistle.

Yet there's more to the wives and girlfriends of the Argentine and German teams than good looks and a footballing other half. From tennis players to bloggers, models and pop stars, FEMAIL reveals why the World Cup Final WAGS are as worth watching as their men.

Exciting times: Montana Yorke (left), Ann-Kathrin Brommel (centre) and Cathy Fischer (right) will be among the crowds cheering on Germany on Sunday

Patriotic: Per Mertesacker's wife Ulrike Stange (left, dark hair) is a professional handball player, while right, Messi's wife Antonella Roccuzzo shows her patriotic side

ANTONELLA ROCCUZZO - LIONEL MESSI

The three-time Ballon d’Or winner met Antonella before he achieved global fame with a ball at his feet having grown up together in the Argentine town of Rosario.  They started dating in 2008 and in 2012 had their first child together, whom they named Thiago.

In enemy territory this summer, Antonella will be doing her best to keep Messi calm and relaxed as Argentina aim to win their first World Cup trophy since 1986.

ULRIKE STANGE - PER MERTESACKER

The
 30-year-old wife of defender Per Mertesacker, handball player Ulrike 
Stange is no stranger to sporting success in her own right having led HC
 Leipzig to victory in the German league on two separate occasions.

Stange
 also plays for the German national side and boasts an impressive 38 
caps, although has notched up fewer international wins than her 
footballing husband.

Now
 a mother to a son, Paul, with Mertesacker, Stange lives in London and 
currently plays for amateur side, the Thames Handball Club, which is 
based in Twickenham.

Successful: Both Mesut Ozil's girlfriend Mandy Capristo (left) and Sergio Romero's Eliana Guercio (right) have enjoyed stellar acting, modelling and singing careers

ELIANA GUERCIO - SERGIO ROMERO

One of the most glamorous of the Argentine WAGS, 36-year-old Eliana Guercio is a successful model and actress, and the wife of Monaco and Argentina goalkeeper, Sergio Romero, 27.

Currently appearing on stage in No Somos Santas on the Avenida Corrientes, Buenos Aires' answer to London's West End, Guercio is also working on a new play, El Referi Cornudo, with famous Argentine director, Gerardo Sofovich.

MANDY CAPRISTO - MEZUT OZIL

Despite
 being just 24 years old, Mandy Capristo has already racked up a CV 
impressive enough to rival that of her other half, Arsenal and Germany 
star, Mesut Özil, 25.

A
 singer, songwriter, TV presenter and model, the Baden-Württemberg-born 
beauty started her career at the tender age of 11 when she won Kiddy 
Contest, an Austrian TV talent show with the song, Ich wünsche mir einen
 Bankomat.

Since
 then, her career has gone from strength to strength, with a stint in 
girl group Montrose and a successful solo career among the highlights. 
She even found time to compete in Let's Dance - the German version of 
Strictly - in 2012, although failed to take home the top prize.

Stars: Although little known in the 
UK, model Ann-Kathrin, left, is as famous as her footballer boyfriend in
 Germany. Gisela Dulko, right, used to be a tennis pro

Impressive: Dulko retired in 2012 at the age of 27 but not before managing to cause an upset by beating Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon in 2009

GISELA DULKO - FERNANDO GAGO

The
 Amazonian other half of Boca Juniors midfielder Fernando Gago, Gisela 
Dulko, 29, enjoyed a successful tennis career until retiring in November
 2012, aged 27.

During
 her career, Dulko and her doubles partner Flavia Pennetta racked up an 
impressive tally of wins  - eventually becoming world number ones and 
triumphing in the Australian Open and WTA World Tour among others.

Less
 impressive was her singles career, in which she enjoyed a relatively 
modest amount of success and a top WTA ranking of number 26. 
Nevertheless, Dulko did manage to pull of a series of impressive upsets -
 most famously, when she beat Maria Sharapova in the second round of 
Wimbledon in 2009.

ANN-KATHRIN BROMMEL - MARIO GOTZE

25-year-old
 Ann-Kathrin has appeared on Germany's Next Top Model and has landed 
numerous lingerie shoots and appearances in magazines such as FHM thanks
 to her stunning looks.

But
 the girlfriend of German star 22-year-old Mario Gotze isn't content 
with being a successful model. She's also a keen musician who can play 
the piano and is launching a pop career in Germany under her singing 
alias, Trina B.

Looking good: Karina Tejeda, the girlfriend of Sergio Aguero, is a huge star in her native Argentina, while Sarah Brandner (right) is one of Germany's most famous WAGS

KARINA TEJEDA - SERGIO AGUERO

Better known in her home country as La Princesita, 28-year-old Tejeda is one of Argentina's most popular singers and specialises in a genre called cumbia which is similar to salsa and is hugely popular in South America.

Since meeting her other half, Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero, 26, her musical career has gone on hold with angry Argentine music fans blaming her sporting boyfriend for her reduced output.

SARAH BRANDNER - BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER

Tall,
 blonde and beautiful, Sarah Brandner, girlfriend of Bayern Munich's 
29-year-old midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, is one of the German 
team's best known WAGS.

A
 swimwear model, 25-year-old Brandner has appeared on the covers of some
 of her native country's most prestigious titles, among them tabloid 
Bild and GQ Germany, as well as US title, Sports Illustrated.

Successful: Lena Gercke is the girlfriend of Real Madrid and Germany star Sami Khedira and won Germany's Next Top Model in 2006 when she was just 18 years old

DANIELA SAURWALD - GONZALO HIGUAIN

While the majority of the watching WAGS will have no qualms about roaring their man on, spare a thought for the German girlfriend of Napoli and Argentina striker, Gonzalo Higuaín, 26.

Saurwald, also 26, has been dating the footballer since 2011 and is a successful journalist in her own right. That, however, might not be enough to compensate for the lose-lose situation in which she will find herself come Sunday when her man takes to the pitch against her home team.

LENA GERCKE - SAMI KHEDIRA

One
 of the most glamorous WAGS on the World Cup circuit is Lena Gercke, the
 statuesque girlfriend of Real Madrid and Germany midfielder, Sami 
Khedira, 27.

Ms
 Gercke, 26, shot to fame in 2006 when she triumphed in the first series
 of Germany's Next Top Model - winning a contract with IMG Models and a 
cover shoot for German Cosmopolitan in the process.

Although
 most of her energies are now focused on a burgeoning TV career, Gercke 
continues to work as a model and has appeared in campaigns for 
Microsoft, H&M, Mexx and Geox among others.

Working hard: Lisa Trede, wife of Germany's Thomas Muller, is a dressage star in her own right while former glamour girl Evangelina Anderson (right) is an actress

EVANGELINA ANDERSON - MARTIN DEMICHELIS

The stylish wife of Argentina and Manchester City defender, Martín Demichelis, 33, Evangelina Anderson is a former glamour model who now devotes her time to a burgeoning acting career.

Most of her credits have come in the telenovelas (soaps) beloved by her compatriots, most notably in long-running series Sábado Bus, La Pelu and La Noche de Mirtha. She also appeared on reality show,  Bailando por un Sueño.

LISA TREDE - THOMAS MULLER

The world of WAGS has no shortage of model members but Lisa Trede, the 24-year-old wife of Bayern Munich's Thomas Müller, is certainly not your average model or, indeed, WAG.

Her passion is horses and like her husband, she's no stranger to competitive sports and has a career in dressage to her name as well as a stable of steeds at the couple's home near Munich.
