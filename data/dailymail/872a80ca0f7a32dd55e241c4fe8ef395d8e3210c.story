Jenson Button will surprisingly start from third on the grid in an emotional British Grand Prix during which he – and thousands of fans in pink shirts – will pay tribute to his father John, a popular motor-racing figure who died suddenly earlier this year.

The McLaren racer will don a pink helmet and has urged fans to wear the colour, which John sported as his ‘lucky’ race-day shirt.

The proceeds from the sale of the specially-designed t-shirts will go to the Henry Surtees Foundation, a brain trauma charity that was established in memory of former world champion John Surtees’s son who died on track.

Button had not believed possible that he would have qualified so high up the grid. Smiling widely, the British driver said: ‘It was quite an emotional slowing down lap.

‘It’s in front of your home crowd and I knew the old boy would have been very happy. He’s definitely smiling down today.

‘This was probably dad’s favourite race because it reminded him of the karting days when it was father and son, just us trying to beat the world.

‘We came here camping in ’94 across the road from the entrance, in a caravan, and I remember the toilets being horrendous. 

‘To come back here and to see his son race in a Formula One car meant a lot to him. If he knew the number of people who were wearing pink you would never hear the end of it.’

Button Snr, who was a leading Rallycross driver in the 1970s, died in the South of France in January. Up until then he attended all but one of his son’s Formula One races over 14 seasons.

He enjoyed life on and off the track, avidly wearing headphones to monitor the team radio.

‘I miss him when I am out of the car on a quiet weekend – that’s the really tricky one. And at home as well.

‘You’ll be watching TV and there will be something you knew he would have loved and for a split second you want to call him.

‘The paddock can sometimes be very dull and he’d brighten up the place, whether his son was doing well or not.

‘I’m really looking forward to the race. The parade lap might be a little bit emotional.’

In a lively qualifying session, neither Ferrari nor Williams made it out of the first session.
