Four Westpac employees were held hostage in the Sydney siege.

All four have been confirmed as safe, with one undergoing medical treatment, believed to be non-life threatening injuries and have rejoined their families.

Westpac employees Marcia Mikhael, Selina Win Pe, Viswakanth Ankireddy and Puspendu Ghosh were four of the 17 held hostage in the dramatic 16-hour siege from Monday morning.

They were able to make a break for the exit of the café about 2am after 50-year-old gunman and self-styled sheik Man Haron Monis began to fall asleep.

Ms Mikhael, 42, who works as a Westpac executive, was carried out of the café by two emergency services workers with blood running down her leg.

Information technology workers Ankireddy and Ghosh, who are working as the project managers for Westpac, managed to flee the cafe.

Mr Ankireddy, who has worked in Australia for the past seven years, was among several people photographed with their hands in the air as they fled to freedom from the café.

Selina Win Pe and Ms Mikhael were forced to stand in front of a black Islamic flag and relay demands required by the gunman in separate videos.

India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said Prime Minister Narendra Modi monitored the hostage situation from beginning to end.

'The hostage crisis in Sydney is over. Viswakanth Ankireddy is safe. He is undergoing some medical check ups and will be back home safe,' Swaraj said in her first tweet after the end of the dramatic siege.

Five minutes later, she tweeted: 'Another Indian hostage Shri Pushpendu Ghosh is also safe.'

Ankireddy's father Ishwar Reddy said he received a message from his daughter-in-law Shilpa and his colleagues after his son came out of Lindt cafe.

'My son is okay and my son will call me,' he said.

Westpac CEO, Gail Kelly told Daily Mail Australia: 'It's a sad day for all of Australia as we learn of the tragic loss of life following the events in Martin Place, Sydney earlier this morning. My heart goes out to anyone touched by this tragedy.

'However, it is with relief that we can confirm this morning that all four of our people (including two from one of our technology partners) are safe and accounted for following the incident.

'Our primary concern is the wellbeing of our people who were involved in this traumatic incident, along with their families. To that end, we are offering them all the support we can.

'Our thoughts are with the victims and their families in this difficult time.

'The privacy of Westpac's people and their families is paramount and we will not be providing any further comment on the individuals concerned.'
