Teaching assistant Andrew Tetley had an affair with a 15-year-old pupil but was spared jail after a judge accepted his claim he thought she was 16

A teaching assistant who had an affair with a 15-year-old pupil has been spared jail after a judge accepted his claim he thought she was 16.

Andrew Tetley, 28, who worked at a school in Lancashire, did not have sex with the girl, but they had kissed and sent explicit photographs of themselves to one another.

Preston Crown Court was told that Tetley, who had also touched the girl's breast, believed she was 16, despite having access to records which would have confirmed her age.

He admitted sexual activity with a child as a person in a position of trust, but was handed a six-month jail term, suspended for two years. 

Judge Andrew Woolman told Tetley the sentence was suspended because the background to the case meant it was 'unnecessary' to lock him up, and said he would not need to sign the sex offender's register. However, he is banned from working with children.

The court was told the relationship came to light when the school's assistant headteacher heard rumours of a sexual relationship between the pair.

Lisa Worsley, prosecuting,  said: 'As a result of hearing these rumours, [the assistant head] spoke to her and her phone was taken from her.

'On looking at the contacts it transpired that Mr Tetley's mobile number appeared in there under the name "Andy".'

Miss Worsley said that the girl explained her first contact with keep fit fanatic Tetley was via Instagram.

She later told police she and Tetley had initially talked about her career prospects but she became sexually attracted to him due to his good looks. She said both realised their meetings were wrong and tried to stop. 

'Initially they talked about career stuff and had a laugh,' said the prosecutor. 'She regarded him as good looking.'

Miss Worsley said the pair exchanged telephone numbers and continued to speak and in interview the girl said that they had met up within a couple of days of making contact but knew 'it was wrong'. She said it was she who suggested meeting up and Andrew responded saying they were doing enough by talking.'

The court heard that the pair had met twice over three months when they had visited a pub, with both occasions initiated by the girl, who was just weeks away from her 16th birthday. 

During these meetings, they had talked and kissed, and on one occasion he had touched her breast. Miss Worsley said: 'She said it was proper kissing, with tongues, and she was happy with what he had done.'

During a police interview, the girl said the pair had exchanged a series of explicit messages involving their sexual fantasies and where they could have sex.

'He asked for photos of her and there were very sexual conversations,' Miss Worsley added.

Preston Crown Court was told that fitness fanatic Tetley had sent the girl photographs of himself topless

Preston Crown Court was told that Tetley, who had also touched the girl's breast, believed she was 16, despite having access to records which would have confirmed her age

'She sent him pictures of her upper body naked and in underwear and he sent pictures of his top body.

'After a bit they both realised it was wrong and tried to stop. He had access to her registration forms and could have had the ability to check her age if he wanted to.'

David Traynor, defending, said Tetley, of Leyland, Lancashire, believed the girl was 16 years of age and contact was established by her rather than the defendant.

Judge Andrew Woolman (pictured) sentenced the assistant on the basis that he thought she was 16 

He said: 'The meetings were suggested by the girl rather than the defendant.

'There was no element of coercion at any stage and it's the defendant that broke off contact a month or so prior to his arrest.

'He was in a new role as a teaching assistant and he felt he was not coping with the situation.

'His employment has gone, his reputation has gone and he's going to struggle in future to get other forms of employment.'

Sentencing Tetley, Judge Woolman said: 'A child is somebody under the age of 18 not under 16 but you were under a position of trust and had been appointed as a temporary teacher.

'You were in a position of trust and you knew perfectly well you should have been the one saying no and putting a stop to contact of an indecent nature.

'Certainly when she suggested meeting you should have said no. In the end you met twice, the first time you were kissing and talking in he car, the second time it went a bit further.

'Fortunately you didn't proceed to full sex. I sentence you on the basis you thought she was 16, although I observe you had the means to find out. 

'Fortunately you didn't go any further...and didn't participate in full sexual activity.

'I accept that you brought the relationship to the end but I suspect that was because you knew rumours were circulating.

'I sentence you on the basis that she was 16 and you had the means of finding out if you wanted to.

'You are 28 years old, a bright young man and you have rather wrecked your future for the moment. It's unnecessary to deprive you of your liberty immediately.'

Tetley, who was suspended from his job when the allegations came to light, was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge.
