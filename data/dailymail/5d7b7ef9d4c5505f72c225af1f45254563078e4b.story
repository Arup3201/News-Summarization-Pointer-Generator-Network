Ben Youngs is out of his rut, back in the England team, and the way he managed to relocate his missing spark may serve as a useful message for the entire national squad.

The Leicester scrum-half worked out that he was thinking too much, fretting too much, analysing and training and playing with tension. 

He decided to go back to basics; to just play and not worry so much. The results have been encouraging, as he prepares to start against Samoa on Saturday.

He said: ‘Last year, when I wasn’t involved in the Six Nations, the biggest thing was to go back to my club and find that spark again; find that thing that got me there in the first place, which was just playing rugby and enjoying it. 

'I was struggling for form and I didn’t know how to get out of that rut because I hadn’t been in that situation before. I found myself training longer, kicking longer. I found myself passing longer, doing more weights — whatever it may be to find a way through. And in fact the best thing I could have done was to have done nothing.

‘I’m going to strip it right back to the minimum and focus on enjoying the performance on Saturday.’

Starting two Tests on the tour of New Zealand in June helped revive Youngs’s self-belief, and he added: ‘Some guys haven’t been through a dark patch, but they will at some point because everyone does.

‘I think when you first come in and you’re young, you’re too naive to understand the pressures of it. I’ve come full circle — back to realising what got me here in the first place.’
