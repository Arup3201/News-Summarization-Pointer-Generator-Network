Tony Pulis says West Bromwich Albion are being made to wait on their pursuit of Callum McManaman – but says he has ‘lots of irons in the fire’.

Wigan have so far held firm in the face of two bids from West Brom, the latest on the table amounting to around £4million for the 23-year-old winger.

Pulis is keen to make McManaman his first signing since taking over, and is also in the hunt for Darren Fletcher – although he is aware the Manchester United midfielder has a number of options with West Ham appearing to lead the chase.

Pulis said: 'We’ve an interest in McManaman along with one or two others. It’s got to be right for everybody. Both clubs have go to agree. It’s got to be right for the player as well.

'If it’s not McManaman we’ve got other irons in the fire. Like a lot of things, you’d love things to drop into place straight away, but it’s often not that way.' 

Pulis added: 'I think Darren is talking to three or four other clubs as well. We have shown an interest. The lad has got to sit down and make a decision.’

Meanwhile, Georgios Samaras is set to leave West Brom on loan as Tony Pulis' clearout continues.

The Greece international is expected to join Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal on a six-month deal with a view to a permanent move, Sportsmail understands.

He signed a two-year deal in the summer after joining on a free from Celtic but has made just eight substitute appearances, all without scoring.
