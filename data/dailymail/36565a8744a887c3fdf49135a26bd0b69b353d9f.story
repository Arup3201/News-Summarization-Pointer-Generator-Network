West Ham have announced the signing of midfielder Diego Poyet on a four-year deal.

Poyet, son of Sunderland manager Gus, arrives at Upton Park following the expiry of his Charlton contract after the two clubs agreed an undisclosed compensation fee.

The 19-year-old, who has already joined up with his new 
team-mates at the Hammers' pre-season training camp on the French-Swiss 
border, told the club's official website: 'I'm very happy to be here. It
 took me by surprise a little bit and it all happened very quickly.

'It's a great club to be at and I know a few of the boys here already.

'It was a no brainer to sign, I wanted to come out here to the training camp as soon as I could and I'm grateful that they've had me here.

The new West Ham youngster only made his Charlton debut at the start of the year and is delighted to have made the step up to the top-flight.

'It's massive to come to a Premier League club. It's what I wanted to do - I wanted a new challenge and soon as I heard there was a chance of stepping up I had to take it.

'I played quite a few games last season with Charlton and I just want to push on now. Like any young player, the first thing you want to do is get into the first team. I need to show the staff, players and the gaffer what I'm capable of doing and maybe pushing my way in.

'West Ham is a great Club with a lot of tradition, moving to a new stadium and everything, it was a no brainer for me because you never know if you're going to get that kind of chance again.'

The 
midfielder becomes Sam Allardyce's fourth signing of the summer 
following the captures of Mauro Zarate, Cheikhou Kouyate and Aaron 
Cresswell.
