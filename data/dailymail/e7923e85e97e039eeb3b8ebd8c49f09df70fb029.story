Border control turned fashion police when staff at an American airport decided these shoes were not going to fly.

Security at La Guardia airport in New York confiscated these gun-shaped heels, even though the plastic models would never be capable of firing a bullet.

'What not to wear through a #LGA checkpoint,' a Transportation Security Administration  spokeswoman tweeted, along with a photo of the shoes, on July 16.

The spokesman explained that the gun 
heels would have been permitted in checked luggage but no mock weapons 
are allowed in hand luggage.

The shoes were voluntarily surrendered so no arrest was made.

The shoes were spotted in the 'prohibited items' section at the airport and shared online as part of a broader initiative to remind the public of what not to bring on board through the TSA Twitter and Instagram pages.

No one has yet returned to pick up the shoes.

British socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson also found herself in a similar predicament. 

She was arrested, she said, at
Zurich airport in March when she tried to take her gun-shaped shoes on a
commercial flight.

She tweeted a picture of Chanel's resort 2009 collection, with the caption: 'Was arrested ar Zurich airport with my Chanel killer heels in my luggage... not a good look on the x Ray!!'

In 2008, Madonna was heavily criticised for wearing the Chanel pistol heels, as it was a way of glorifying gun use.

According to the Transportation Security Administration agency's blog, 49 real guns were confiscated last week.
