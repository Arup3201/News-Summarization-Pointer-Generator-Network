Cambridge United's 0-0 draw on Friday with Manchester United pulled in a high of 7.1 million viewers.

The FA Cup fourth-round tie was screened on BBC One, with the League Two side holding the three-time European champions to a draw and earning a replay.

A tweet from BBC Sport's communications officer said '7.1m tuned in to @BBCOne last night to see Cambridge v Man Utd £getcarriedaway'.

A further tweet from @TVRatingsUK said viewing figures had averaged out at 5.82 million, a 25.3 per cent share of the audience.

Those viewers supporting the Premier League giants were left disappointed though as Louis van Gaal's side struggled to break down their supposedly inferior opposition.

Despite fielding a strong team that included Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie, Untied failed to score and will now have to try again at Old Trafford.
