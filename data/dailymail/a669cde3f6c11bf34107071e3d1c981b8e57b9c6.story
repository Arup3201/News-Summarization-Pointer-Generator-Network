A dwarf who makes £150 an hour by dressing as an Oompa Loompa or Superman at stag dos and hen parties is facing jail after harassing schoolgirls for sex.

Marc Corrieri, 21, who can make £750 per night by being handcuffed to the groom, first messaged a pair of twins on Facebook when they were 15 and asked one to feel 'his third leg'.

The 4ft 2in performer, from Motherwell, also sent explicit messages to a 13-year-old girl whom he met at an under 16s disco.

Marc Corrieri, 21, from Motherwell, pictured dressed as an Oompa Loompa, is facing jail after harassing schoolgirls as young as 13 for sex. The other men pictured are not involved in the case

He initially offered the girl a job as a face-painter for £50 per day, but soon started asking about her sex life.

Corrieri admitted four charges of
 sending sexually explicit messages to two 16-year-olds and two 
13-year-olds between May 2011 and August 2012 when he appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court.

The court heard he was caught by police after one girl's mother found the messages and feared her daughter was being groomed.

The court heard Corrieri - who did not know any of the girls before he started message them - boasted he was rich and had a flash car.

He stopped messaging the twins for a few months - but started with the sexually-explicit messages again once they turned 16.

Depute
 fiscal Imran Bashir told the court: 'He originally asked the sisters to
 go for a walk with him. He sent regular messages but they stopped 
abruptly for about six months.

Corrieri, who can make £750 per night at stag parties and hen dos, often dresses as Superman as part of his act. There is no suggestion the other men pictured are involved in the case

The performer, pictured left and right in his different guises, contacted a pair of teenage twins over Facebook and asked one to go to the woods to 'feel his third leg'

'When they turned 16 he messaged them again and they described the messages as being a lot more 'creepy' than before.

'He asked one of them how far she had gone with a boy and told her to wear a mini skirt and tights and that he had a fancy car.

'He would message her about five or six 
times a day and he made sexual remarks. He told one of them he was now 
her boss and she would have to do what he said.

He also messaged a 13-year-old offering her a job as a face-painter, after meeting her at an under 16s disco. He then started sending her explicit messages asking about her sex life, the court was told

'She was worried he would be waiting for her after work.'

The court heard Corrieri contacted another 13-year-old and repeatedly asked her what school she went to.

The entertainer earns up to £750 in one night, usually by handcuffing himself to grooms during stag parties.

Talking about his career, he previously told the Mail: 'It’s a different career. I wanted to have a laugh and I just thought, "go for it".

Corrieri admitted four charges of sending sexually explicit messages when he appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court. He will be sentenced next month

'I get paid to go out and party with different lads, we get a lot of attention from the ladies and I get to enjoy myself.

'I dress up for them [stags] as Superman or as an Oompa Loompa but I draw the line at dressing up as a woman - that’s a no go.'

The rules of Corrieri's act include no picking up or throwing, no tampering with his drink, not using the word 'midget' and no police involvement.

Corrieri will be sentenced next month.  He has been put on the sex offenders' register.
