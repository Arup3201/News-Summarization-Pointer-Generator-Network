The FA have decided not to take any action against Rio Ferdinand for his off-the-ball shove on Fernando Torres during Sunday's FA Cup clash between Manchester United and Chelsea.

The incident was on the agenda for the FA as it went unseen by referee Howard Webb.

However, the FA determined that they would take no retrospective action against the United defender and he will be available for the quarter-final replay, whenever it is played.

Ferdinand tweeted after the let-off on Tuesday afternoon: 'My timeline is full of bitter people...come on guys we are all alive, enjoy each day + give thanks! We on the home run #EPL let's do this.'

Ferdinand went in for a challenge with Torres and 
after the pair had got up, barged him with his forearm and kicked his 
achilles while the referee was looking the other way.

The Chelsea striker fell to the ground in a heap and the United defender then dragged the Spaniard back to his feet.

Last Tuesday Ferdinand was seen sarcastically clapping in referee Cuneyt Cakir's face in the aftermath of United's 2-1 defeat by Real Madrid.

Cakir had controversially sent off Nani during the game and the furious Ferdinand made his feelings clear at the final whistle.

He avoided censure from UEFA over the incident and the club also were not punished for not fulfilling their post-match media obligations.

Sir Alex Ferguson refused to speak after the Madrid game and his players were also prevented from speaking.

Ferdinand and the Scot spoke to MUTV after the Chelsea match.

The 34-year-old centre back said: 'We gave them the impetus to claw their way back into the game. We played some great football at times but were so careless at times. If you are careless you are going to get punished. That was the case.

'But we are still in the Cup. Wembley is waiting for one of us to go through and hopefully it is us.

'We go to Stamford Bridge for the replay with confidence. We have the tools. We have been there before this season and done well and with the squad we have we don't fear going anywhere.'

Ferguson said his team paid for their efforts against Real the previous midweek.

'We're lucky to be in the Cup. We just ran out of legs and Chelsea were far the better team in the second half,' he said.

'But I can't be critical of my side because the running they had to do on Tuesday night, against a really top side in Real Madrid, had its bearing on today's result, no doubt about that.

'The two full backs, Rafael and Patrice (Evra), are knackered and the two central midfielders tired badly. We kept giving the ball away and it made it a long day for us, going from one penalty box and back to our own.'

Ramires and Eden Hazard levelled the game for Chelsea following early goals by Javier Hernandez and Wayne Rooney. United lost Nani with a hamstring problem at the end of the first half but Ferguson said the injury was not 'too serious'.
