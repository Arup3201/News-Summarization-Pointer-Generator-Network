A 26-year-old self-taught photographer, who dropped out of university to pursue his passion, has captured his hometown of Melbourne on camera as it’s never been seen before.

Tom Blachford took around 1,200 shots of the Victorian city in 70 minutes after his girlfriend bought him a ride on a doorless helicopter for his birthday last year.

And the finished result of around 100 aerial photos depicting Melbourne’s beaches, coast, ports, docklands, freeways and homes is stunning.

Mr Blachford took off over the city at around 11am on February 18 2014. It was the first time he had shot from such heights – about 500ft above water and 1000ft above land. 

'I'd never done it before. My girlfriend bought me the helicopter with the door off for my birthday. It was scary as we only had a car seat belt to hold us in,’ Mr Blachford told MailOnline.

The couple had 'planned it for over a year to get the perfect day'.

Aerial industry: The 26-year-old captured the rows and rows of parked cars in the city

Homes: Mr Blachford shot these houses at The Cove, Beacon Cove, in Port Melbourne, 5 km south-west from Melbourne's CBD

Mr Blachford said he wanted it to be 'hot enough for people to be at the beach'. And it certainly was, with temperatures reaching a sweltering 46 degrees that day.

Thankfully the helicopter with its door off meant they got a cool breeze while shooting.

'She bought me an hour with a pilot who was a friend of ours, we had to wait for a time that suited him too,' Mr Blachford added.

Special day: Mr Blachford took around 1200 shots of the Victorian city in 70 minutes after his girlfriend bought him a ride on a doorless helicopter for his birthday last year

The photographer has lived in Melbourne all his life, apart from a nine-month stint in London in 2009, and said what shocked him the most about his photos of the city was the 'perspective'.

'I've never seen anything like it,' he said.

When the couple and their pilot friend took off above Melbourne, Mr Blachford had intended to focus on capturing the dockland's containers, however they took off near the beach and instead he got ‘really obsessed’ with the coast line and snapping the surfers.

'The frame was about 20 metres so I could hone in on what people were doing,' he said.

'I saw how so much goes on in summertime in Melbourne… people were swimming, running, paddle surfing.'

'I would have liked the beach to be a little more packed,' he added.

Mr Blachford, who has been a professional photographer for six years, hopes to get back up in the air over Melbourne to take more photos in the hope of creating a book packed with his images.

Despite one hour's ride in the doorless helicopter costing around $600 an hour he said it's 'worth it'.
