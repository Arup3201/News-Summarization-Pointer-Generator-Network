Behind bars: Eddie Ray Routh is  charged with two counts of murder after shooting Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a shooting range in Texas

Police now say that the former marine accused of killing the country’s best sniper and another man at a shooting range now says that he threatened to kill himself and his family back in September and he was hospitalized.

A police report from the September 2 incident states they were alerted to the threat when they received a call about 25-year-old Eddie Ray Routh, who is now in jail on two murder counts for allegedly killing Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield.

‘Eddie stated he was hurting and that his family does not understand what he has been through,’ the police report says.

The Dallas Morning News reports that when officers arrived on the scene they found Eddie walking outside the family home without shoes or a shirt, and smelling like alcohol.

His mother said that the argument started when his father said that they were going to take away his gun.

‘She stated Eddie began arguing and stated that he was going to “blow his brains out,”’ the report stated.

As it has been previously reported, Routh allegedly told police at the scene that he has post traumatic stress disorder.

He was arrested on Saturday evening following the afternoon shooting at the gun range, and while he was reportedly calm during the arrest, his time in jail has not been as smooth.

Routh is now tied to a chair in 
solitary confinement as prison guards put him on suicide watch after he 
started acting aggressive towards guards on Sunday night when he refused
 to give them back his food tray.

The 25-year-old former soldier was 
Tasered by guards at Erath County Jail when he 'was trying to attack 
them,' according to ABC News.

Routh- who Kyle and Littlefield took 
to the range in an effort  to connect with the troubled former soldier 
and potentially help him work through his post traumatic stress 
disorder- remains in jail on $3million bail.

Police caught Routh after he drove off to his sister's house in Kyle's Jeep and confessed to the killings.

'I don't think anybody knows why. They all went out there together,' Erath County Sheriff Tommy Bryant said on Sunday.

'It's my understanding that the 
suspect may have been suffering from some type of mental illness from 
being in the military himself,' he said of Routh.

Scene: The shooting took place at Rough Creek Lodge in Glen Rose, Texas earlier this month

He said Routh's mother may have reached out to Kyle for help with her son.

'We kind of have an idea that maybe 
that's why they were at the range for some type of therapy that Mr. Kyle
 assists people with,' Mr Bryant said.

Bryant didn't know whether Routh was on any medication or whether he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Authorities say the three men arrived 
at the Rough Creek Lodge southwest of Fort Worth around 3.15pm Saturday.
 A hunting guide discovered the bodies of Kyle and Littlefield around 
5pm and called 911.

Both Kyle and Littlefield were shot multiple times, and police found a semi-automatic handgun at Routh’s home.

According to the Fort Worth 
Star-Telegram, Routh’s mother Jodi had reached out to Mr Kyle, asking 
him to help her son overcome his PTSD since he had talked about his 
rehabilitation efforts in the past.

While in Iraq, Kyle survived being shot twice 
and he lived through six separate IED explosions as his unit, Charlie 
company of SEAL Team Three, saw significant combat

Kyle recorded more than 150 sniper kills - the most in U.S. military history - between 1999 and 2009

'Chris struggled with some things,' 
said Travis Cox, Kyle’s friend who serves as director of the non-profit 
called FITCO that the former sniper started since his retirement.

'He'd been through a lot and he 
handled it with grace, but yeah he did struggle with some things. And he
 found a healthy outlet and was proactive in his approach to deal with 
those issues and wanted to help spread his healing, what worked for him,
 to others. And that's what he died doing.'

Littlefield, a 35-year-old friend and 
neighbor, was Kyle's 'workout buddy,' and also volunteered his time to 
work with veterans, Cox said. He was married and had children as well.

'He's a very gentle, sweet-hearted man, just a great man, kind of quiet,' Cox said of Littlefield.

Caught: Police searched for Routh for hours following the shooting on Saturday afternoon but he was found after his sister called him in, as he fled to her house in Kyle's pick up truck and proceeded to confess to the killings

Criticism: Former Texas congressman Ron Paul posted a controversial message about the shooting

'He just really cared.

'He wanted to do whatever he could to 
help veterans and help see that vision of serving others that Chris had.
 He shared that vision with all of us. He was a great man.'

Mr Cox said he understood that Kyle 
and Littlefield were helping Routh work through his own PTSD and he said
 it was not a FITCO session.

Very few public figures have spoken 
out about Kyle's death, though former Republican presidential candidate 
and Texan congressman Ron Paul decided to break his silence on Monday.

'Chris Kyle's death seems to confirm 
that "he who lives by the sword dies by the sword." Treating PTSD at a 
firing range doesn't make sense,' he wrote to his 400,000 followers.
