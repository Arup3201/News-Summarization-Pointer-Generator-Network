Alexis Sanchez could be the man to dump defending champions Spain out of the World Cup after putting Australia to the sword.

The Chilean may play in the Spanish league for Barcelona but he will have no qualms if he can inspire his team to victory over the 2010 winners on Wednesday.

Sanchez scored one and created another as Chile justified their ‘dark horses’ tag with an impressive 3-1 win over Australia in Cuiaba.

And after Spain were thrashed 5-1 by Holland earlier in the evening, Chile have the chance to end their title defence in midweek.

Coach Jorge Sampaoli said: ‘We started well and put Australia under a lot of pressure,’ he said. ‘We had a good understanding in attack, especially with Alexis Sanchez as the focal point, and we created several chances.

‘After Australia scored, we lost a little bit of momentum and we got frustrated. With the calibre of our next two opponents, we will have to give a more complete performance. The prospect of playing Spain at the Maracana is electrifying.’

Man of the Match Sanchez drilled home from close range in the 12th minute to give Chile the lead then ran from midfield to set up  Jorge Valdivia to score two minutes later.

But former Millwall and Everton striker Tim Cahill halved the deficit with a trademark header before half-time and it needed a late third from Wigan’s Jean Beausejour to seal victory for the South Americans.

Cahill was frustrated afterwards with some of Chile’s underhand tactics and described one exchange with Eugenio Mena.

‘There was an incident where the left-back elbowed me and kicked out at me when I was trying to run past him for a cross, and I’ve got a yellow card,’ Cahill said. ‘I called him a cheat and he said, ‘Yeah, I’m a cheat, so what?’’ ’

Australia must beat Holland on Wednesday to keep their hopes alive.
