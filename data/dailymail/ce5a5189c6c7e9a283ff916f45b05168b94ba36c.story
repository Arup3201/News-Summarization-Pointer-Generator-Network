Daryl Murphy has been the recipient of private tuition by Ipswich coach Terry Connor in a bid to find the net more often, and boy is it paying off.

So far this season the pair have spent hours together after training perfecting the fine art of finishing; nobody was more pleased to see Murphy score the equaliser and his 19th of the campaign to turn this fixture just after the break than Mick McCarthy’s right-hand man.

Ipswich fell behind to Kieran Lee’s 20th-minute strike, thanks to a terrible mix-up between goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski and Christophe Berra, but their talisman spearheaded a comeback which saw them rise to fourth in the Championship.

So, what’s changed for a striker who previously saw goalscoring as an infrequent hobby rather than a career? ‘Wonderful management and coaching,’ McCarthy joked. ‘He’s got the No 9 on the back now. It’s about momentum. He’s reaping the rewards for working hard - extra training on Fridays.

‘It would have been a travesty had we lost that one. We contrived to give a goal away but deserved it.’

The age of a £5billion Premier League is still over a year away, but Ipswich are insistent that they will grace it well before then, becoming one of the three top-flight newbies next season.

Monies on offer to promoted clubs remain astronomical next year, of course, and the Tractor Boys want a piece of those riches. When you boast a striker such as Murphy, that’s always a distinct possibility.

Murphy earlier struck a post; so too did Darren Ambrose, making his third full debut for the club for whom he began his career, while Sheffield Wednesday manager Stuart Gray opted not to speak afterwards.
