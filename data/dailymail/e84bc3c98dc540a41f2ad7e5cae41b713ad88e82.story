It seems Paddington Bear has come a long way from the wide eyed dufflecoat-wearing marmalade-loving character once adored by children in the 70s. 

If the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) is to be believed, cinemagoers heading to watch his latest big screen incarnation can expect 'dangerous behaviour, mild threat, mild sex references (and) bad language' from Britain's best loved bear.

However, the PG rating came as somewhat of a surprise to Paddington's 88-year-old creator Michael Bond, who chronicled his adventures in a series of popular books.

The new Paddington Bear film has been given a PG rating rather than the U expected by creator Michael Bond

The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) had warned cinemagoers to expect 'dangerous behaviour, mild threat, mild sex references (and) bad language' from Britain's best loved bear

He had still to see the film by the time it was given its certificate, but he said he was 'totally amazed' by the classification advice.

The writer, who makes a cameo appearance in the film, said: 'I'd be very upset. I might not sleep well tonight. I can't imagine what the sex references are. It doesn't enter into it with the books, certainly.'

The BBFC has since gone on to clarify that the swearing in the film was 'infrequent' and substituted 'innuendo' for 'mild sex references'.

The 'infrequent scenes of dangerous behaviour' in the film refer to Paddington hiding in a fridge and skateboarding while holding on to a bus, while 'mild threat' was seen when a taxidermist villain 'threatens to kill and stuff' the famous bear.

And among the 'mild sex references' - later revised to 'innunendo' - is a homoerotic 'comic sequence in which a man disguised as a woman is flirted with by another man'.

Ben Whishaw provides the voice for the Peruvian bear in the live-action film, which also features Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville, Dr Who star Peter Capaldi and Australian actress Nicole Kidman.

Whishaw replaced Colin Firth as the voice of Paddington after The King's Speech star quit, saying he was having trouble finding the voice of the marmalade-loving bear.

The film sees Paddington despatched from his native jungle and smuggled on board a boat to England.

However, the news came as somewhat of a surprise to Paddington's 88-year-old creator Michael Bond, who chronicled his adventures in a series of popular books, who said he was 'totally amazed' by the classification

Recent children's films which have been awarded a universal (U) certificate include The Lego Movie, Despicable Me 2 and Monsters University while Frozen (mild threat) and How To Train Your Dragon 2 (mild violence and threat) were awarded a PG certificate.

Announcing the revised consumer 'insight' advice, the BBFC said it had made the amendments after the distributor asked for it to be reconsidered.

It now reads: 'dangerous behaviour, mild threat, innuendo, infrequent mild bad language'.

In a statement, the BBFC added: 'The content in the film goes beyond the BBFC guidelines at U and the distributor was content with the PG certificate for the film.'

Changes to guidelines last year resulted in the body being tougher on bad language at the U level as a result of public consultations.

Bond's books have sold 35 million copies worldwide since they were first published in 1958.
