In his youth, he prided himself on his fitness and physical appearance.

But at the age of 55, Prince Albert of Monaco clearly doesn’t realise his days of wearing figure-hugging Lycra sports kit are long behind him.

Albert’s choice of ultra-thin, figure-hugging white top, teamed with baggy blue shorts, served only to draw attention to the monarch’s middle-age spread as he spent the day on a beach in Norway at the weekend.

And unfortunately the presence of his
 superfit wife, former South African swimming champion Charlene 
Wittstock, 35, merely highlighted how Albert has put on weight since 
their marriage two years ago.

Albert,
 a former Olympic bobsleigh competitor, floundered around as he joined 
in a few games of beach volleyball at the belated 50th birthday 
celebrations of retired player Jan Kvalheim near the holiday resort of 
Kragero.

‘Albert is a 
friend, I’ve known him for many years,’ said Mr Kvalheim. He said the 
prince was ‘passionate about volleyball’, adding: ‘He has his own beach 
volleyball court at home.’

Albert and Princess
 Charlene, who still works out every day and follows a strict diet, are 
enjoying a tour of Scandinavia before returning to Monaco to attend the 
lavish private wedding of Andrea Casiraghi, the oldest son of Albert’s 
sister, Princess Caroline.

Little and large: Despite Prince Albert's love of volleyball, he looks as though he could do with spending more time on his private court back home

Mr Casiraghi, 29, who is second in line to the principality’s throne, is due to marry Colombian heiress 
Tatiana Santo Domingo in the Royal Palace in Monte Carlo at the end of 
the month. The couple  have a son, Sacha, born in London in March.

Mr Casiraghi may one day accede to the throne of Monaco, if Albert and Charlene do not produce an heir of their own.

Albert,
 son of Prince Rainier and Princess Grace, is the father of at least two
 illegitimate children and supports them from his multi-million-pound 
fortune. Neither has a claim to the throne.
