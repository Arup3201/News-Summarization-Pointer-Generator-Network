When a 9-year-old Kent, Washington girl recently turned on her new Disney princess walkie talkie for the first time, she was subjected to the filthy conversation of two truckers.

No sooner had stepmother Jennifer Childress popped batteries into the bright pink toy, than it began to spout profanity and even racist slurs.

Apparently the same frequency used by the toy is used by nearby trucker CB radios. 

No good, buddy: Jennifer Childress demonstrates how her 9-year-old stepdaughter's Disney princess walkie talkie is stuck on a trucker frequency

Trucker talk: Though it is pink and adorned with Disney royals, the toy began to spout profanity and racial slurs as soon as they popped in the batteries

‘We picked up some things that she shouldn’t be hearing, or any child should be hearing,’ the appalled Childress told Seattle’s KCPQ.

Childress declined to specify what her young stepdaughter heard, but foul trucker talk must have come as a surprise no matter how filthy.

Making matters worse for the girl: her walkie talkie only has one frequency, so she can’t shut the dirty talk off.

Not so sweet: 'We picked up some things that she shouldn¿t be hearing, or any child should be hearing,' said Childress, though she didn't get any more specific

Frequently used: Many common devices use the 27.145MHz frequency. Unfortunately for the Childress family, so do CB radios used by many truck drivers

According to the sticker on the back of the walkie talkie, it uses a frequency of 27.145Mhz.

In addition to candy-colored kid’s communication devices, the frequency is commonly used by remote controlled toy cars as well as wireless computer keyboards and mice.

It’s also used by CB radios.

Angry: Childress said she plans to contact the FCC about the issue

Short for citizen’s band, the compact radios are well-known as the preferred method for long-haul truckers to relay information about traffic, police activity, and—unfortunately for the Childress family—their swarthy trash talk.

Kent, Washington also happens to be near I-5, the West Coast’s busiest highway.

Childress told KCPQ she plans to contact the FCC.
