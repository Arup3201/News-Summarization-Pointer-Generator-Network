Portugal badly missed injured Cristiano Ronaldo as they were held to a goalless draw by Greece in a pedestrian World Cup warm-up on Saturday.

Also rested were Pepe and Raul Meireles as the home side had the better of the game at the Estadio Nacional and should have taken the lead inside the first 10 minutes.

Eder headed Nani's curling cross straight at Greece goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis from close range in the second minute and Ricardo Costa was also foiled by Karnezis after he escaped his marker at a corner.

Greece struggled to create chances and a long range strike from Vassilis Torosidis was the sum of their efforts in a poor first half.

Striker Kostas Mitroglou was an isolated figure up front, where he was reduced to chasing down long balls.Greece introduced veteran captain Giorgos Karagounis at half-time with Portugal bringing on experienced striker Hugo Almeida but neither player made an impact.

Greece threatened in the final 10 minutes after the introduction of winger Giannis Fetfatzidis whose direct running put the hosts on the back foot.

There was an injury worry for Greece after central defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos limped off.

Concerned: It was far from the ideal pre-World Cup preparation for Portugal coach Paulo Bento

'In the first half, we clearly deserved to be ahead and, apart from the last few minutes when we were worn out, we always had control of the game," Portugal coach Paulo Bento told RTP television. 'We were penalised by our lack of efficiency.'

'We have to be prepared,' he added. 'We have to be able to play without players who are our first choices.'

Portugal face Germany, United States and Ghana in their World Cup group while Greece meet Colombia, Ivory Coast and Japan.
