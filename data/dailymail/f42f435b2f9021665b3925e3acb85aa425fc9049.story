Lucas Silva has conceded a loan away from Real Madrid could enhance his long-term prospects at the Bernabeu amid reports he will make a move to Porto.

The Brazilian has appeared just seven times for Real since his January transfer from Belo Horizonte's Cruzeiro but believes he can stake a claim for a regular place in Carlo Ancelotti's side.

However, with just four starts in a possible 19 matches since his debut in the Champions League against Schalke on February 18, regular football elsewhere could be a blessing in disguise for the 22-year-old - and if reports are to be believed Porto are in the box seat.

'I was astonished with the news about a potential loan move to Porto. I have not heard anything about it,' Lucas Silva told Brazilian publication Globo Esporte.

'I have a contract with Real Madrid and I want to fulfil it. I have already had opportunities and I think I have the ability to be in the team and to play.

'But a loan move could be a good option.'

Lucas Silva followed the Schalke match by starting in February 22's 2-0 league win over Elche and the March 1 draw with Villarreal. He then had to wait a fortnight to make Ancelotti's XI against Levante.

Before the international break he came on as an 88th-minute substitute for Luka Modric in their 2-1 El Clasico defeat.

His fellow Brazilian Casemiro has enjoyed plenty of game time at Porto, who sit second in the Portuguese league, where he was loaned from Real at the start of the season.

Casemiro has made 28 appearances, scoring four goals and picking up 11 yellow cards.
