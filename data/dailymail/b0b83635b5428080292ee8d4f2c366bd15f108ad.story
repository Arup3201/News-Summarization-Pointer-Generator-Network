What do a bar and a county jail have in common?

Apparently a lot to one highly intoxicated Michigan woman who mistook the Van Buren County Jail for a bar, police say.

Authorities say the 39-year-old woman smelled of alcohol and appeared intoxicated when she pulled into the jail's parking lot in Paw Paw at 2am.

The woman was reportedly trying to pick up her boyfriend at a bar.

Jail/Bar: A 39-year-old Michigan woman pulled into the parking lot of what she thought was a bar, in actuality, she had pulled into the parking lot of the Van Buren County jail

Mistaken: The woman admitted to police that she had just come from a local bar and thought she had arrived at another one but instead found herself at the sheriff's office

The department said that Deputy Robert Miersma spotted the woman and a breath test showed that the woman's blood alcohol level was more than twice the state's legal limit of 0.8 percent.

The woman's level was 0.17 percent, according to police. 

The woman admitted to police that she had just come from a local bar and thought she had arrived at another bar. Instead, she found herself at the sheriff's office.  

The woman was arrested for drunk driving.

She is being held at the Van Buren County Jail. 

DUI: The woman was given a DUI after a breathalyzer test showed she her blood alcohol level to be almost twice the state's 0.8 percent legal limit 

This wacky story is not the first of its kind though.

In August, a drunk Pittsburgh woman attempted to drive an unmarked police car with two officers inside, according to the New York post. The woman was arrested and charged with robbery of a motor vehicle, disorderly conduct, and public drunkenness. 

But wait, there's more. 

In September, a drunk-driving attorney was arrested and given a DUI when police caught her driving drunk and trying to order a pizza at the same time.
