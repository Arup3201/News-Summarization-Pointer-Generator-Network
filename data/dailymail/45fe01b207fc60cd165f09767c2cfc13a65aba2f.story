Louise Woodward should take parenting classes 'for the sake of her own child', the family of Matthew Eappen have said

Louise Woodward should take parenting classes ‘for the sake of her own child’, the family of the baby boy she was convicted of killing in America 16 years ago have suggested.

The former nanny, who is seven months pregnant, needs to learn to control her temper before her own child arrives, they say.

Woodward was jailed for 15 years in 1997 for killing eight-month-old Matthew Eappen at his home in Boston. 

Her sentence was reduced to time served -
 279 days - when her second degree murder conviction was overturned for 
involuntary manslaughter, and she returned to the UK.

Matthew’s aunt Mary Wong said yesterday that Woodward had a ‘right to have a child’, but added: ‘For the sake of her own child I hope she is a better parent.

‘For the sake of her family I hope her parenting skills have come a long way... I think that she needs to have parenting skills and support for her baby.’

Mrs Wong, 52, added: ‘I hope no harm comes to the child.’

She said there was ‘nothing Louise does’ that could take away the time Matthew spent with his parents Debbie, 48, an ophthalmologist, and anesthesiologist Sunil, 47. 

She said: ‘Debbie is a good person. She’s
 tormented by what happened but I don’t think that she wishes any evil 
things on Louise or her family or the child. Debbie’s reaction is going to be very personal to her.’

Feelings about the case still run high in America too.

Woodward was jailed for 15 years in 1997 for killing eight-month-old Matthew Eappen at his home in Boston but her sentence was reduced when her second degree murder conviction was overturned

A
 decade after it was resolved Woodward was dubbed ‘the most notorious 
criminal in Massachusetts’ by an American magazine - beating a drug 
dealer who had topped the FBI’s most wanted list.

Matthew’s paternal grandfather 
Koodathummuriel Eappen, 75, a doctor, told the Daily Mail: ‘I really 
don’t want to stir up bad memories other than wishing her well and 
hoping that she looks after her baby well.

‘Her temper is probably more mature now so that she is able to control the baby’.

Elaine Whitfield Sharp, Woodward’s lawyer
 during her trial, was among the few who said that she welcomed the news
 of the pregnancy - and still thought that Woodward was innocent.

Miss
 Sharp, who is originally from Chester but lives in Boston, was in 1998 
secretly recorded saying she thought her client was a ‘duplicitous 
monster’, but appears to have softened her views.

She said: ‘I’m very happy for her and I think she will make a great mother. She deserves it.

‘I think she is a kind and very gentle person. She loves animals, she was very kind to children.

‘Everyone deserves a second chance, and everyone deserves a chance at happiness’.

A neighbor of the Eappen's disagreed though. The woman who gave her first name Kate, has three children who were the same ages as the Eappen kids.

Asked about the family's loss Woodward's future plans to mother a child, Kate quickly condemned Louise Woodward.

'I think justice did not occur,' she said.

Kate agreed that the Eappen family since moving into the neighborhood 13 years ago have been the best neighbors. 'They are both exceptional people both professionally and personally.

You wont find any nicer, kind-hearted people.'Unfortunately, as both families grew-up together on the same leafy street, Matty's loss is even more pronounced.

'They lost a child and they live with it everyday,' she said. 'Matty's always in their thoughts.’

Woodward, 35, is now a dance teacher in Bridgnorth, Shropshire and is expecting with her husband, businessman Antony Elkes, 32.

Woodward has declined to talk about her 
pregnancy and said she wants to maintain her privacy’, though she has in
 the past spoken of how much she wants a family.
