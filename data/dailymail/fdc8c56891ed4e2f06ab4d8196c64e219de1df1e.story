A hedge fund billionaire allegedly told one of his employees to burn down his neighbor's Bahamas mansion in a long-running dispute over the beachfront property.

Louis Bacon, 61, initiated the blaze that devastated Canadian clothing magnate Peter Nygard's home on the island of Lyford Cay in 2009 after he refused to sell him the property, court papers allege.

It is claimed that in a fit of anger, the founder of New York-based Moore Capital Management ordered an employee to 'find a way to burn Mr Nygard's f***ing house down'.

It is the latest accusation in the spat between Mr Bacon and Mr Nygard, who is the founder and chairman of women's fashion house Nygard International, based in Winnipeg.

According to the court papers, filed in Los Angeles, a representative for Mr Bacon told one of Mr Nygard's employees, 'See what I told you', just two weeks after the blaze in November 2009.

However, fire authorities say the incident was 'accidental', while 68-year-old Mr Nygard admits in the papers that the cause of the fire is 'unknown'. 

Mr Bacon's legal response has not yet been filed with the court but he has denied the allegations and called them 'groundless'. He points out that he was extremely concerned about the fire which he understood to be down to faulty wiring. 

He points out that his wife and young children were asleep next door and a change in wind direction could have had tragic consequences. He also says that it was his security team that raised the alarm. 

The eccentric Mr Nygard, who has seven children by four women, built his impressive 150,000-square-foot beachfront mansion, dubbed 'Nygard Cay', in 1987.

It is inspired by the Mayan civilization's architecture, with one of its major buildings being a 32,000-square-foot grand hall with a 100,000lb glass ceiling.

Before the blaze, it had been featured on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' and 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous', with visitors including former U.S. President George Bush and actor Robert De Niro.

In recent years, Mr Bacon has been fighting Mr Nygard's attempts to expand the property, claiming he has been illegally and surreptitiously adding to the size of his compound.

He has previously accused Mr Nygard of creating an environmental disaster by enlarging his  estate in the exclusive community at the western tip of New Providence island with illegal sand dumps.

He has also accused his neighbor of character assassination, claiming he used a private jet to fly Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan, to the Bahamas, where he denounced Mr Bacon as a racist at a rally.

And last month, Mr Bacon alleged that Mr Nygard paid dozens of protesters to march through the streets of Nassau carrying signs linking him to the Ku Klux Klan.

However, the clothing magnate argues that Mr Bacon is simply angry at his refusal to sell him his 'prized parcel'.

In his action, Mr Nygard also claims that Mr Bacon installed four 'large, military-grade' speakers at the boundary between their two properties, before aiming them at his bedroom.

He then blared 'ear piercing noises' toward Mr Nygard with the sole aim of embarrassing him in front of his guests, the papers allege.  

'There, that's a message from Mr. Bacon. Don't f*** with Louis,' one of the Mr Bacon's assistants allegedly shouted after blaring the noise.  

The lawsuit, which cites a conversation between the tycoons, has finally hit the U.S. after going through the Bahamian courts.

In New York court papers, filed yesterday, Mr Bacon alleges that videos taken by Mr Nygard’s former employee, Stephen Feralio, will prove he was behind a smear campaign.

But in his Los Angeles legal move, Mr Nygard is aiming to keep the 1,000-plus hours of alleged footage away from his neighbor.

Earlier this year, more than 100 people, including actor Sean Connery and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, filed a legal complaint against the Bahamian government over efforts by Mr Nygard to redevelop his compound. 

Those who filed the complaint accuse the government of withholding public records related to work on Mr Nygard's compound.

They also say the fashion mogul previously caused significant environmental damage during continuing renovations that they say occurred without the required permits.

In addition to redeveloping his compound, Mr Nygard is seeking to develop and gain access to land surrounding his property, prompting an outcry from other residents.
