A young cancer patient has drawn up a bucket list of things to do before she dies – including going on the Orient Express and being a bridesmaid.

Ann-Marie Noble, 31, had a promising career in the RAF, having progressed to the rank of flight lieutenant.

However, in April she was diagnosed with terminal cancer and doctors told her there was nothing more they could do for her.

Ann-Marie Noble, 31, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in March last year. After chemotherapy and radiotherapy she was given in the all-clear in October. However, in April she was told the cancer had returned

But Ms Noble, from Hartlepool, says she is refusing to give up, and is determined to live her life to the full in the time she has left.

She said: ‘There’s no point getting angry and asking “why me?” - that’s not going to get you anywhere.’

Ms Noble has compiled a bucket list, with wishes including eating a meal prepared by Raymond Blanc, driving a super-fast car, and meeting Terry Wogan for a drink.

She said: ‘I don’t feel any different. You’ve just got to have a positive attitude. But having terminal cancer has made me realise how much good there is in the world - people have been so supportive. I just want to enjoy my life - enjoy every minute.’

The former Durham University student has been in the RAF for five years and is currently based at RAF Marham in Norfolk.

She was initially diagnosed with cervical cancer in March last year after an annual smear test.

Ms Noble is still having chemotherapy to prolong her life but doctors have said there is nothing more they can do to save her

Despite various treatments, including laser treatment and a radical trachelectomy to remove part of her cervix, no tumours were found.

But cancer was found in some of her lymph nodes so she had to endure gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Following a scan last October she was given the all-clear.

She took a month to recover at home and by Christmas she was back on the ski slopes to celebrate.

But another cruel blow was to follow after she began getting pains in her left leg.

Tests were carried out and doctors told Ms Noble that the cancer had returned.

Two tumours were discovered resting on her major organs, and medics said she could not have any more radiotherapy.

‘They said it was back, and there’s nothing they can do,’ she said.

She explained all doctors could offer her was six months palliative chemotherapy.

She
 said: ‘The chemo is not going to cure me. It’s giving me some extra 
time, and I will only do it as long as it’s working and can give me a 
good quality of life to spend with my family.’

She has drawn up a list of things to do before she dies which includes having tea at the Ritz, going in a hot air balloon, taking her family on holiday, and wing walking

Ms Noble, whose sister Philippa, 30, is in the army, spent time with her family, parents Ann and Mick Walsh, both 53, and sister Melissa Walsh, 19, last week before returning to her RAF quarters, where friends are helping to care for her.

Ms Noble has urged other young women to make sure they have regular smear tests to reduce their chances of cervical cancer.

She says she has no doubt that having
 her smear test last year gave her more time to spend with her family 
and friends, as she thinks she may have died by now without it.

She had this advice for other women and girls: 'Just take a leaf out of my book.

'I was diagnosed when I was 30 and had absolutely no symptoms.

'I would say go and get the test. It could save your life. Even if I just help one person, that would be fantastic.

'I was fit as a fiddle, endurance 
running and doing five marathons back-to-back, but cancer is so 
indiscriminate, it can affect anyone.'

Ms Noble has been hindered in carrying out her wishes by the costs of travel insurance for people in her situation.

She has set up a web page called 'Help me: As cancer sucks!' where well-wishers have been donating towards the cost of holiday insurance, which can be up to £2,000.

She has a £4,000 target and insists she will match every pound donated.
