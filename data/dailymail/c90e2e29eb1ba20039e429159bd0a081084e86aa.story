A reward of £30,000 is still on offer for the safe return of the Stradivarius, which was taken in London when Korean-born violinist Min-Jin Kym, 32, went to buy a sandwich in November 2010

A violin initially thought to be the £1.2 million Stradivarius stolen from a classical musician is likely to be a replica, police said today.

The instrument was seized in a raid by Bulgarian officers in February but experts have concluded it is not the 300-year-old antique.

The replica is believed to be a training violin made in Germany or the Czech Republic no more than 100 years ago, British Transport Police (BTP) said.

A reward of £30,000 is still on offer for the safe return of the Stradivarius, which was taken in London when Korean-born violinist Min-Jin Kym, 32, went to buy a sandwich in November 2010.

The internationally acclaimed musician was targeted when she sat down to eat at a branch of Pret A Manger outside Euston station and noticed the black case containing the instrument was missing.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Taylor said: 'After a violin bearing Stradivarius markings was recovered in Bulgaria on Wednesday February 27, we worked closely with underwriters, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and Bulgarian police, through Interpol, to establish if it was the 1696 Antonio Stradivarius taken from Euston in 2010.

'Experts examined the instrument in Sofia and it is thought to be a replica training violin, made in either Germany or the modern-day Czech Republic no more than 100 years ago.'

The 1696 Antonio Stradivarius violin, valued at about £1.2 million, was stolen with a £62,000 Peccatte bow and another bow valued at more than £5,000, both of which were in the same case.

The violin has a number of unique identifying marks, including visible repair marks under the bridge and a specially moulded chin strap.

Three people were arrested in connection with the theft in 2011 following a public appeal on the BBC’s Crimewatch programme.

John Maughan, 32, and two teenagers were later convicted and sentenced but the violin and bows were not recovered.

While the missing items are of high value, they are so unique that they are unlikely to sell for anything close to their true price and would be quickly recognised as stolen property by art or antiques dealers.

A spokesman for the violinist said: 'Ms Kym appreciates the efforts of the police and the insurance company in the ongoing search for the stolen instrument, and for the many good wishes from the public at this time.'

Gemma Stevens, musical instruments insurance director at Lark Insurance, said: 'Our main concern continues to be recovering the irreplaceable instrument.

'Not only has this been a huge loss to our client, it’s also been a significant loss to the world of musical instruments. As such, the reward has been increased and we would urge anyone who has any information regarding the violin to contact Crimestoppers.'
