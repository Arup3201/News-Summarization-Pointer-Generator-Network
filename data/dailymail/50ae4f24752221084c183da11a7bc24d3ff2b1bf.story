When actress Kim Novak, 81, attended the Oscars this year she hadn't been seen in public for a while and her looks provoked much conversation.

Some were shocked by Novak's appearance and cruel comments were made. Novelist Laura Lippman felt bad about that.

So much so, she decided to post a picture of herself, in her most natural state, with no make-up in 'solidarity' with the actress, using #itsokkimnovak.

Novelist Laura Lippman tweeted this using #itsokkimnovak

The Guardian reported how the author, known for her Tess Monaghan series, then challenged others to tweet images of how they really looked and she was inundated!

Laura told MailOnline: 'I really felt bad for Kim Novak, especially after reading a piece about how Harry Cohn preyed on her insecurities. Then a friend pointed out to me that beauty and feminine beauty is such a big theme in my current book, After I'm Gone.

'As part of my research, I'd just spent three weeks talking about the options available to a beautiful woman of a certain generation, and how those options changed for her daughters.'

It turned out Laura wasn't alone in how strongly she felt about women (and men) being judged on the way they look and the 'solidarity' images started pouring in from all over the world.

Laura said: 'I think everyone, women and men, but especially women, become frustrated with the focus on appearance. And social media has provided a forum for ordinary people to be judged and ridiculed. So we now have more in common with celebrities in an odd way.'

Erin Mitchell joined in the support with her no make-up selfie too

The 'raw' selfies have been cropping up all over the place, including on Facebook as well as Twitter and Laura thinks they now total around 1,500.

'Because not everyone tags (on Facebook) or uses the Twitter hashtag, it really is impossible to quantify but I had it very reliably, from someone who does marketing, that 1,500 people did it within 48 hours. After that, it's all anecdotal. One friend told me that she saw it being done by a group of Australian friends who didn't know the source. It just goes and goes.' she said.

Perhaps part of Laura's reasons for feeling compelled to stand up for Kim Novak stem from some of her own experiences of being judged on her appearance, she she told MailOnline:

'Six years ago, while on tour, I received an e-mail from a man who complained I didn't look like my author photo. "Do you think that's fair?" he said.

'I thought it was hilarious that someone would attend a book-signing because of the author's author photo. And just this past February, a man came up to me at the Key West Literary Festival and asked if I could sign a book for him. He said, "I'll admit, I picked you because I liked your photo the best."

He was polite enough not to signal disappointment with the real-life experience.'

This man wanted to join in on the 'strangely moving exercise' too

The novelist said she must have looked at 'hundreds' of photos over the past week, and 'with each one, the faces became more beautiful to me. My eye was changing. My aesthetics were changing. When you look at hundreds and hundreds of bare faces, without the benefit of Photoshop or professional lighting, bare faces start to look pretty good.'

In a blog post headlined 'You So Pretty: Kim Novak, c'est moi' she wrote:

'We need to stop lying about how people age. We need to own our Botox, our fillers, our nose jobs, our liposuction'
