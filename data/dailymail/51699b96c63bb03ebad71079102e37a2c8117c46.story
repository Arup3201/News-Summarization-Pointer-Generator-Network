A new book about Paul McCartney has revealed how the former Beatle battled with alcohol and drugs in the 1970s – and how the band came very close to a reunion years after it fell apart.

Man On The Run: Paul McCartney In The 1970s, by Tom Doyle, draws upon several in-depth interviews, and reveals how the musician was stricken with a mental frailty that will astonish his fans.

After all, this was a man whose fame straddled the world.

McCartney struggled so much to find his place in the rock and roll world after the Beatles split in 1969 that he became heavily reliant on alcohol and wracked with anxiety.

He felt ‘utterly worthless’, he told Doyle.

McCartney spent long periods of time at the isolated High Park Farm in Argyll, Scotland, becoming so reclusive that rumours spread that he’d died.

Doyle writes: ‘His often sleepless nights were spent shaking with anxiety, while his days, which he was finding it harder and harder to make it through, were characterized by heavy drinking and self-sedation with marijuana…

‘When he did get out of bed, he’d reach straight for the whisky, his drinking creeping earlier and earlier into the day. By 3 in the afternoon, he was usually out of it.’

His wife Linda found this downward spiral ‘frightening beyond belief’.

To make matters worse there were huge ups and downs in McCartney’s relationship with John Lennon.

In 1976 Lorne Michaels joked that he’d give the Beatles $3,000 if they reunited on Saturday Night Live – and McCartney just happened to be watching with Lennon at his New York apartment.

They nearly took a cab to the studio. However, when McCartney called round to the apartment – the Dakota – the next day, guitar in hand and ready to make music together again, Lennon spat: ‘Please call before you come over. It’s not 1956, and turning up at the door isn’t the same anymore.’

They never set eyes on each other again.

McCartney found some solace in the group he formed in the 1970s – Wings – but it suffered harsh criticism, with a Rolling Stone reviewer pondering whether the first album, Wild Life, was ‘deliberately second rate’ – and John Lennon describing McCartney’s new compositions as ‘rubbish’.

McCartney admitted: ‘To me there was always a feeling of letdown, because the Beatles had been so big that anything I did had to compare directly with them.’

The decade, Doyle writes, was book-ended with nine days in a Japanese jail for trying to smuggle marijuana into the country.

And Lennon was assassinated on December 8 that year. McCartney began recording again, but this time his life was on a distinctly upward spiral.
