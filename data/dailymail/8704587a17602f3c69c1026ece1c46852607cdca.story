A BBC programme featuring 'dynamite' interview tapes with Princess Diana was axed amid fears it would upset the royal family, it is claimed 

The BBC allegedly wasted £500,000 on a documentary featuring 'dynamite' interviews with Princess Diana - but later shelved it because it did not want to upset the monarchy, it has been claimed.

According to the director behind a controversial documentary about the Princess of Wales, the BBC went on to give a misleading account of why the programme was not broadcast.

The Corporation said at the time that Diana: Her Story, Her Words, due to be broadcast on the tenth anniversary of her death, did not sufficiently add to the story of Diana's life.

But, in another controversial documentary being aired tonight, it is claimed the BBC stopped its broadcast amid fears it would upset the Royal Family close to Prince's Charles 60th birthday.

The extraordinary claims are featured in Reinventing The Royals, which hit the headlines late last year after Clarence House allegedly tried to stop the programme being broadcast - a claim it vehemently denies.

Diana: Her Story, Her Words, made by award-winning director Kevin Sim, had included extracts from video tapes of the Princess, taped in 1992 and 1993.

The tapes have been broadcast only once – on American television network NBC, in 2004.

Such was the controversy caused by their screening that the tapes were not sold to other broadcasters.

But, three years later, the BBC spent more than £30,000 buying an option to broadcast three minutes of the tapes for the programme.

The documentary was later axed, with the BBC claiming it did not 'add' to Diana's story - despite having spent hundreds of thousands on its production.

But, in Reinventing the Royals, Mr Sim apparently casts down on why the BBC stopped the recordings being aired.  

According to the The Daily Express, he tells the programme:  'We had a considerable amount of taped interviews with Diana - in terms of giving you the key to Diana the woman, these were dynamite.'

He adds: 'We were told, "well, it's quite difficult – Prince Charles is 60 and we've got exclusive access to him, with Charles, and we don't really want to offend him at this juncture. We wouldn't want to do anything at all, for example, that would mean he would pull out of the film".' 

The tapes were compiled by Diana's voice coach Peter Settelen, an American actor now based in Britain, over several sessions.

Diana, shy by nature, employed him to help her practise public speaking as she became increasingly independent of Prince Charles.

The director behind the documentary claims the BBC cancelled the show because it did not want to upset the Royal Family near to Prince Charles's 60th birthday 

At the time, her marriage was in deep crisis and the conversations with Mr Settelen – which were never intended to be made public – inevitably dwelled on her private concerns.

Peter Settelen recorded 16 tapes during his coaching sessions with Princess Diana at Kensington Palace

She talked frankly about her relationship with the Prince, his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles and her love for her bodyguard, Barry Mannakee, and her suspicions that he had been murdered after he died in a traffic accident.  

Mr Settelen recorded 16 tapes during his coaching sessions at Kensington Palace. Seven of the so-called ‘dynamite diaries’ were discovered in 2001 when detectives raided the house of Diana’s former butler, Paul Burrell.

Mr Settelen fought a long legal battle with her estate for control of the tapes, which he then sold to NBC for an undisclosed sum.  

After purchasing the tapes, the BBC commissioned Mr Sim to oversee the film. The highly-regarded director has won a Bafta for a Dispatches programme on the Beslan school massacre, while his examination of Iran, titled Once Upon A Time In Iran, and his film on the Tsunami, Seven Hours On Boxing Day, were both highly praised.

The Corporation had planned to show the programme in August 2007, with the authentic voice of Diana as the key selling point, to stand it apart from other films being made  to mark the anniversary.

But, shortly beforehand, the BBC decided to axe the show, claiming it added nothing to Diana's story.

According to Mr Sim, the BBC had at the time obtained exclusive access to Prince Charles for a film marking his 60th birthday and feared upsetting the Palace.

A BBC spokeswoman said the decision-makers no longer worked at the BBC and it was therefore 'difficult to comment further.'  

The comments are made as part of Reinventing The Royals, a two-part documentary presented by Steve Hewlett (centre) and which attracted controversy before it was aired due to an alleged row over footage 

Controversial: Hewlett was editor of Panorama when it broadcast the infamous 1995 Princess Diana interview

Reinventing the Royals, a two-part series written and presented by Panorama journalist Steve Hewlett, aired last week.

The series opened with the death of Princess Diana in 1997, with the first episode focusing on the brickbats hurled at Prince Charles in its wake.

With his personal popularity in the doldrums, Charles asked PR guru Mark Bolland, who was hired in 1996, to give his public image a makeover and integrate Camilla Parker Bowles into palace life.

Dubbed 'Operation Mrs PB', the campaign is the source of one of the most embarrassing allegations aired in the programme - namely that Bolland leaked news of Prince William's first meeting with Camilla to the media.

Bolland has denied this incident ever happened, but the Duke of Cambridge was reportedly left angry and upset by the leak and is said to have nicknamed the PR supremo 'Blackadder'.

But the contents of the documentary was overshadowed by the controversy over the programme itself.

The programme was initially delayed, allegedly due to a dispute over footage.

Clarence House denied it had tried to interfere, saying: 'The original broadcast of the programme was delayed by mutual agreement (BBC and Clarence House) whilst permissions were sought.

'All permissions were subsequently granted. We have not seen the programme yet and have no comment to make.'

Nevertheless, the ensuing row reportedly left Prince Charles 'furious' - all the more so when lurid claims of spats between the Buckingham Palace and Clarence House press teams emerged. 

Meanwhile, the BBC had said the documentary was always going to be aired.

A spokesman had said: 'Before Christmas it became clear that there were issues relating to the clearance of archive footage in the forthcoming programme Reinventing The Royals.

'These issues have now been resolved and all the archive material we planned to use is included in the finished programme.

'The first episode of Reinventing The Royals will be broadcast on 19 February and it will be the one that we always intended to show.' 

Princess Diana, the first wife of Prince Charles, was killed in a horrific car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris in August 1997. She died aged 36.

At the time, the Queen faced criticism for failing to capture the mood of the grieving nation.

Public anger began after the Queen took Prince William and Prince Harry to church at Balmoral, just a few hours after Prince Charles had broken the news to them of their mother's death.

There were also accusations that the Queen remained in Scotland for too long, and did not return quickly enough to London, where thousands had gathered in united grief over the Diana's death.

Compounding the Queen’s absence was the lack of any flag flying at half-mast above Buckingham Palace as a sign of royal mourning.
