Eying a bargain: Sir Richard Branson

Sir Richard Branson wants to buy 316 branches from Royal Bank of Scotland – but at a knockdown price thought to be around £1billion less than was previously on the table.

The entrepreneur’s Virgin Money has had informal contact with RBS about a possible purchase after the deal to sell the branches to Santander collapsed on Friday.

Sources said Virgin Money, which tabled a bid in 2010 but lost out to the Spanish bank, would be ‘very interested if the price is right’.

It is thought the Branson company has a price tag of around £650million in mind, far less than the £1.65billion Santander had been willing to pay and only half the ‘book value’ RBS places on the business.

RBS is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer after a £45billion bailout.

Yesterday consumer groups expressed fears that taxpayers could lose out if the branches, along with 1.8million personal and small business customers, are offloaded to Virgin Money.

Eddie Wetherill, of the Independent Banking Advisory Service, said: ‘I would have concerns about this because the UK taxpayer is already in for a substantial amount of money on RBS and we could come out of it with a big loss.

‘You can’t blame Branson for trying it on as he is an entrepreneur with an eye for opportunities. But I don’t trust a system that allows entrepreneurs to feather their nest.

‘In government they don’t seem capable of getting a good deal for the taxpayer. That is the problem. It would have to be watched very, very carefully.

'If Branson is the only bidder, he will pare down the price to the bone. He is not stupid.’

Virgin Money took over the ‘good bank’ part of Northern Rock in January in a deal that has lost the taxpayer between £175million and £289million, according to watchdog the National Audit Office.

It now has 75 branches and 4million savings and mortgage customers. However, it has only 100,000 current account customers.

RBS was ordered by the European Commission to sell the 316 branches as a condition of its taxpayer bailout.

It signed a preliminary agreement with Santander in August 2010 and the deal was initially expected to complete by the end of last year.

Negotiations were called off last week by Santander chief executive Ana Botin at a face-to-face meeting with her RBS opposite number Stephen Hester.

She is thought to have told Mr Hester that the delays, which are understood to have been caused by RBS’s creaking computer systems, had dragged on too long.

Her decision leaves RBS casting about for a new buyer ahead of a deadline of the end of 2013. Other possible buyers include NBNK, which lost out this summer to the Co-op in the race to take over 632 Lloyds branches.

RBS could ask the European Commission to let it keep the branches or extend the deadline. It is also considering floating the branches as a business on the stock market under the old Williams & Glyn’s name, or selling them to management.

The mission by Sir Richard Branson, pictured right, to stamp his Virgin branding on every aspect of life knows  no limits.

It is only days since he forced an embarrassing climbdown by the Department of Transport in its decision to hand his West Coast rail franchise to rival FirstGroup.

Far from resting on his laurels, the opportunistic tycoon is now preparing to pounce on 316 Royal Bank of Scotland branches.

Branson loves to present himself as an iconoclast, a man of the people and a consumer champion in the stuffy world of business.

He would have us believe his Virgin Money is a breath of fresh air bringing much-needed competition into Britain’s jaded and corrupt banking sector.

At least Branson is British, so it would not be yet another overseas takeover.

But he is a billionaire carpetbagger. The thought of him squatting atop his labyrinthine business empire in his paradise island of Necker, plotting a predatory swoop on RBS, is deeply disquieting.

No wonder he is eyeing the RBS branches. After all, the Government has already allowed him to pull off one quite stunning coup with his purchase of the ‘good’ bit of Northern Rock.

The National Audit Office says that transaction lost the taxpayer anywhere between £175million and £289million.

Meanwhile, taxpayers are still on the hook for the ‘bad’ part of  Northern Rock, which depends on a £21billion state bailout.

The Government may feel a need to appease Branson after the rail debacle, but it should resist any temptation to hand him the RBS business.

It is true that the UK banking sector is in dire need of new competition, as the report commissioned by the Government from Sir John Vickers made abundantly clear.

But Virgin Money is still a relatively small operation with just 75 branches. With Northern Rock, it acquired a savings and mortgages operation, not a full-scale high street bank.

For it to take on the RBS branches would be like a sprat trying to swallow a whale.

The evidence so far suggests that Virgin Money would not necessarily offer consumer-friendly banking.

The group climbed down on plans for a compulsory £60 a year fee on a current account it is designing under its own steam, but only after intervention by the Mail.

It is too early to predict whether Branson will succeed in an audacious attempt to sweep up the RBS branches.

But those unfortunate customers have already endured the exploits of Fred Goodwin and the IT meltdown that paralysed millions of accounts earlier this year. Surely they have suffered enough.
