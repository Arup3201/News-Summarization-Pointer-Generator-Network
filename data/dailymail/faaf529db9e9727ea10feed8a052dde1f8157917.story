Radamel Falcao was left out of Manchester United's starting line-up for Monday night's Premier League clash against West Brom due to 'jet lag'.

The Colombian striker was named among the substitutes despite opening his account in United's previous game, a 2-1 victory against Everton on October 5.

But boss Louis van Gaal said Falcao, on loan from Monaco, was suffering from the effects of being away on international duty in South America last week. Falcao played for Colombia in the friendlies against El Salvador and Canada.

Van Gaal told Sky Sports: 'I think Robin van Persie was (back) two days before Radamel Falcao came back and he was in South America. It's a big difference with jet lag and that's the reason he's out the team.'

Wayne Rooney was also absent as he served the second game of a three-game ban following his dismissal against West Ham, so Adnan Januzaj was given a rare start at the Hawthorns.

Van Gaal added: 'Adnan Januzaj has a big opportunity but I gave a lot of minutes in the team as a sub and now he's in the line-up - it's a big difference for him.'

Falcao was sent on in 72nd minute for Juan Mata after Saido Berahino had given the Baggies the lead for the second time after Marouane Fellaini had cancelled out Stephane Sessegnon's early stunner for the home side.

But it was Daley Blind who rescued a point for United with a 87th-minute strike.
