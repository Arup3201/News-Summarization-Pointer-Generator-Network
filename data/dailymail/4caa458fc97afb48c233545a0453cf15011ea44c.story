Anger: Disabled Ollie Lewis, pictured with parents Charmaine and Neil was prescribed a dose of seizure medication ten times his normal amount by Lloyds Pharmacy staff

A hospital chemist gave a severely disabled blind baby a potentially fatal dose of medication, ten times stronger than his usual prescription.

Little Ollie Lewis must take the powerful medication to stop him suffering seizures, with his parents collecting a new dose from Lloyds Pharmacy every week.

It was only thanks to their familiarity with the repeat prescription that father Neil Lewis noticed staff had measured out 2.5ml of Midazolam, rather than 0.25ml.

Mr Lewis, 28, said that if the little boy, who will turn two in February, had taken the dosage it would have killed him.

Ollie was starved of oxygen to the brain, due to a late delivery at St Michael's 
Hospital, Bristol, and suffered catastrophic brain damage, cerebral 
palsy and epilepsy.

The youngster, who was not expected to survive, is also registered blind 
and suffers from seizures - which are treated with Midazolam.

'Two pharmacists checked the dosage, which was supposed to be 0.25ml,' said Mr Lewis, of Worle, Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset.

'But they administered 2.5ml and this was also written on the label.

'If we hadn't spotted it and someone else had given that amount to him it would have killed him.

'After everything we have been through to have this happen is absolutely disgusting.'

Mr Lewis said he and Ollie's mother Charmaine Malcolm, 24, visit the 
pharmacy, based at Weston General Hospital, every fortnight to pick up 
the dose of Midazolam.

He said it was only the family's familiarity with the medication which helped them spot the glaring mistake.

Mr
Lewis said that had Ollie been on one of his regular respite breaks 
with the Springboard or Jessie May Trust charities to give his parents a
break he would have died.

'If he'd been with one of his carers and had a seizure he would have been given this drug and the amount on the box and it would have killed him,' he said.

Both pharmacists got it wrong.

'They have made the biggest mistake they could make without actually killing someone,' said Mr Lewis, who left his job as a recruitment consultant to help look after Ollie round the clock.

'After the way he was brought into this world it is not fair for him to potentially go out because of another error.

'We want this to be investigated to make sure it does not happen again.'

Mr Lewis and former hairdresser Ms Malcolm are fighting a legal battle with the Bristol hospital to try to secure funding for Ollie's care.

At the time of Ollie's birth Robert Woolley, chief executive of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, said he was 'deeply sorry for the errors' made.

Mr Lewis added: 'If we had left Ollie with staff at Springboard or the trust, they are bound by employment law to administer the prescribed amount on the box.

'If he was having a seizure, your reaction would be to just give him the medicine and the amount which is recommended.

'We have still had no apology and it has been over a month now - it is just not good enough.'

A Lloyds Pharmacy spokesman said: 'Lloyds Pharmacy is very sorry that Ollie Lewis was given an incorrect strength of his prescribed medication by our pharmacy located at Weston General Hospital and for any distress caused.

'We have stringent standard operating procedures in place and a full investigation has been conducted into this incident.

'We have shared the findings of our investigation with the hospital trust.'

He added: 'We have written to Ollie's parents to offer our full apology for this incident.

'We would be happy to discuss our investigation findings personally with the Lewis family if they wish to contact Lloyds Pharmacy.'
