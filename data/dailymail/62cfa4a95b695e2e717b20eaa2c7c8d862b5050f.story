Victim: Caroline Vaughan-Salter, 49, died after being hit by the car on Hyde Park roundabout

A top chartered surveyor was run over and killed by a car while lying in a road after having two bottles of wine during eight hours of drinking, an inquest heard today.

Caroline Vaughan-Salter, 49, was killed almost instantly after she was struck by a car on Hyde Park roundabout in central London, the hearing was told.

She was described as a 'warm, kind and caring mother'.

Mystery still surrounds how exactly she ended up lying across the busy junction, but the inquest heard how she had drank two bottles of red wine with work colleagues before making her way home.

The mother-of-three, a director at estate agent Stiles Harold Williams, was last seen on CCTV at the south east corner of Hyde Park roundabout crossing to the central island.

A toxicology report revealed that Ms Vaughan-Salter, a director of chartered surveyors Stiles Harold Williams, was around three times over the drink-drive limit at the time of her death.

She was almost three times the drink drive limit with 230mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. Coroner Darren Stewart said she was so drunk it could have brought on a coma resulting in her collapse.

The inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court heard how she was hit by a sliver Seat Leon driven by Richard Reid just before 9.30pm on October 16 last year.

On the day of the accident, Ms Vaughan-Salter and her colleague Nigel Amos left their office at 1.30pm for a meeting.

The pair went to Cafe Concerto in Piccadily, and stayed there until 4.30pm drinking six glasses of red wine each.

They moved on to the Three Crowns Pub, on Babmaes Street, where they met more work friends and continued drinking.

Mr Amos, an associate at Stiles Harold Williams, said: 'That day she seemed happy.

'She suggested we go out for lunch for a spontaneous meeting about generating business.

'We moved on to the pub and I would say we were getting drunk at this point. I had already drank three glasses of wine and Caroline had drank the same as me.

'At the pub we ordered another two bottles of wine between four of us. In total I would say we both drank two bottles of red wine each.'

Aysha Taylor, another colleague, met the pair later in the evening.

She told the inquest that Ms Vaughan-Salter, of Fulham, west London, was drunk by the time she got there, but was coherent.

She said: 'It was clear that she had had a drink. She was quite merry.

'She was perfectly coherent, but she clearly had consumed alcohol because she was louder than normal and more tactile.'

Ms Vaughan-Salter, Mr Amos and Ms Taylor then decided to return to the office to collect their items and make their way home.

Ms Vaughan-Salter told her colleagues she would get a taxi home, while Ms Taylor and Mr Amos walked to Green Park station.

It
was around this time that Richard Reid, a delivery driver, was driving 
back from his pregnant girlfriend's house in Grove Park to his home in 
Kensal Green, north west London.

'I thought it was rubbish in the road,' he told the inquest. The cars were going past it. There was nobody swerving. I continued driving. I had a feeling inside straight away that something did not feel right'- Driver Richard Reid tells the inquest

As he crossed the roundabout he saw 'rubbish' in the road and decided to drive on - without realising it was the businesswoman who was lying on her back. He hit her at around 20mph.

'I thought it was rubbish in the road,' he told the inquest. 'The cars were going past it. There was nobody swerving.

'I continued driving. I had a feeling inside straight away that something did not feel right.

'I got out of the car and when I got closer I saw a body and I started screaming. I shouted out "she was in the road, she was in road".

'I was uncontrollable. I did not think for a millisecond that it was a person. I thought it was debris in the road. I was a mess. I tried so hard not to replay it in my head for ages.'

Ms Vaughan-Salter’s ex-husband, stockbroker Dominic Waters was allowed to address the hearing and suggested to Mr Reid: ‘Most adults in this room are drivers and we wouldn’t drive over something in the road with the form of a body for fear of damaging the car.’

Speaking very quietly, he replied: ‘I just thought it was debris.’

PC Andrew Osborne said that the section of road where Ms Vaughan-Salter's body was found was shadowed slightly and it would have been difficult for Mr Reid to have known a body was in the road.

Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner Darren Stewart said: 'It's clear to all of those involved that she had consumed alcohol, quite a considerable amount.

'The level of intoxication would have seriously impaired her ability to judge what was a safe place to cross the road and take her on a route from work to her home address.'

Describing her injuries as 'unsurviveable', Coronor Stewart said a post-mortem revealed Ms Vaughan-Stewart also suffered from an undetected heart problem which could have caused her collapse.

He added: 'She was a living and caring mother who invested a considerable amount of time in her children.

'She was a beautiful and glamorous, with a quirky sense of humour.'
