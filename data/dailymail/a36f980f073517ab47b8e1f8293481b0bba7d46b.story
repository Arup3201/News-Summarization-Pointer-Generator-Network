Amanda Holden has launched a blistering attack on Mumsnet after users of the parenting website criticised her for going back to work only three weeks after giving birth.

The Britain’s Got Talent star returned to the judging chair last year after coming close to death having her second child.

Mums on the site condemned her decision, claiming she was afraid of losing her slot on the show.

But now the 42-year-old has hit back, criticising the website for its ‘negativity’ and ‘encouraging guilt’ among mothers.

Speaking
exclusively to The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine, she said: ‘I visited 
Mumsnet because I thought, “Oh, that sounds like a nice site where you 
can get handy tips on weaning your baby and helpful advice.”

I thought it sounded like the 
perfect social medium; a support network for mums. But I discovered that
it’s a lot of women criticising, judging and having a go at each other.

‘What we need is a site that gives 
positive support instead of encouraging guilt by making women who aren’t
able to breastfeed feel bad, or condemning women for going back to 
work.’

She discovered the 
negative comments only after a journalist asked her about the 
‘controversy’ over her return to Britain’s Got Talent.

One Mumsnet user had written: ‘Spending time with your newborn is way more important than some s****y talent show.’

Another added: ‘I’m sure she could afford to take a few more weeks off, let’s not pretend she’s desperate for money.’

Ms Holden, married to record producer Chris Hughes, has two children, Lexi, seven, and Hollie, one.

In January 2012, after giving birth to Hollie, Amanda’s heart stopped beating for four minutes. Her placenta had become attached to her bladder, causing massive haemorrhaging.

The star, pictured exclusively in You
magazine, said her determination to restore normality for Lexi was 
behind her quick return to work.

‘The normal in my house is Mummy doing
Britain’s Got Talent. When I had been in hospital Lexi had seen me in 
such hideous circumstances that I decided I needed to get back to normal
for her and for me.

‘Mummy shoved on her eyelashes and 
went back on Britain’s Got Talent because that was normal. I took Hollie
with me and we went to Birmingham and I just did three days.’

Mumsnet
co-founder Justine Roberts said: ‘Of course people can be critical, but
for every opinion there is usually a counter one.’
