This Christmas, the average Brit will watch 13 films, eight soap episodes and 19 comedy shows and re-runs, a study has revealed.

The average adult will spend a total of 46 hours and 30 minutes watching TV over the festive period - or five hours and 10 minutes a day from Christmas Eve to New Year's Day. 

And the majority of that time will be spent watching films, Christmas movies or TV specials and comedies, according to researchers.

It also emerged almost half consider the TV schedule to be one of the best things about the Christmas period.

Andy Oldham, of cashback and reward site Quidco.com, said: 'For many of us, Christmas is the time of year when we get to sit back and relax - especially those who are lucky enough to get the entire period off work.

'And despite the presents, food and Christmas festivities going on during that time, the bumper TV schedule is something which many people are really looking forward to.

'With a number of our favourite films, soaps and dramas all on the box, and fighting for viewers with Christmas specials, it can mean a large amount of that time off work is going to spent in front of the TV.

The Coronation Street Christmas Day special is the programme Brits are most looking forward to this year

The Queen's Speech came out sixth in the research as the top festive programme we don't want to miss 

'All families need to worry about is now is who gets to be in control of the remote control.'

The study of 2,000 Brits found an average of 13 films will be watched from Christmas Eve until New Year's Day, as well as 10 Christmas movies or TV specials and nine episodes of a drama.

An average of 11 comedies will be viewed, along with eight soap episodes, eight repeats and six documentaries.

Brits will also settle down to watch four episodes of their favourite box set.

But it's the Coronation Street Christmas Day episode most people look forward to watching, followed by the Downton Abbey and Dr Who festive specials.

The study also found Elf was in the top ten films to watch during the 46 and a half hours of TV we will watch between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day

The Snowman was number 10 on the list of not to miss films at Christmas, but was beaten by TV specials like Downton Abbey, Dr Who and Eastenders

The traditionally gloomy Christmas episode of EastEnders came fourth, with Strictly Come Dancing's Christmas special at five.

The Queen's Speech, Only Fools and Horses, Emmerdale's Christmas episode, Elf and the Snowman also feature in the top ten films and programmes Brits look forward to watching each year.

But it seems the television can be the cause of arguments in some households over Christmas, with 27 per cent saying there are usually rows about what to watch and who is in control of the remote.

It also emerged that while a civilised 16 per cent of families take it in turns to choose what to watch, more than a fifth say their father usually has the final.

But in 12 per cent of households its the children who take control of the remote.

Researchers also found two thirds are looking forward to Christmas TV, with 62 per cent believing the festive season is really underway once they start seeing Christmas-themed adverts.

And more than six in ten even admit to getting excited by the thought of receiving their Christmas TV guide and marking all the shows they want to watch.

To make sure they make the most of the Christmas television, almost one in five are considering upgrading their subscription package, while 18 per cent are even thinking about splashing out on a new TV.

Andy Oldham, from Quidco.com added: 'Christmas is a costly time, but there are an incredible range of options available for those looking to upgrade in time for Christmas.

'With great cashback available on everything from pay-as-you-go TV packages to big screen TVs, there have never been more ways to ensure you don't miss a single minute of festive TV, whoever is in charge of the box.'
