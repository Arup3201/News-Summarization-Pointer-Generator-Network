Sacked: Sheriff's deputy Edeania Nettles, 39, has been fired from Osceola County police department after allegedly ripping out the hair of a deputy she found in a parked cruiser with her police officer husband

A 39-year-old sheriff's deputy embroiled in a vicious love triangle has been fired after allegedly ripping out the hair of a deputy she found in a parked car with her police officer husband.

Edeania Nettles was sacked from Osceola County police department on Thursday after an internal investigation found she violated Sheriff's Office policy for allegedly attacking St. Cloud police officer Jennifer Hoyos on October 2.

Police said Nettles found Hoyos sitting in a police cruiser with her husband, St. Cloud police Sgt. Elbert John Nettles, about midnight at Ted Broda Memorial Park, Florida.

Nettles had followed her estranged husband to the park where he'd met up with his co-worker girlfriend, Hoyos.

The
pair were reportedly chatting when Nettles approached 26-year-old Hoyos' 
vehicle, reached through the window and punched her on the left side 
of her face.

She then allegedly dragged Hoyos out of her patrol car by the hair and assaulted her, according to Orlando Sentinel.

Hoyos was on duty and wearing her police uniform.

The women scuffled before being separated by 36-year-old Elbert John Nettles.

Hoyos was left with bleeding lips and cuts to knees and face, and a big clump of hair ripped from her head was hanging off of her duty 
uniform.

Police said Elbert John Nettles and Hoyos worked together, but he was not her supervisor.Â 

Nettles was arrested on a charge of battery on a law-enforcement officer.

She was immediately removed from duty while the Sheriff's Office investigated.

Orlando Sentinel
reported Elbert John Nettles received a written reprimand in 2012 after
he accidentally shot off half of a fellow SWAT team member's right 
middle finger during a drug raid.

In 2011, he was one of two St. Cloud officers who shot a woman dead when they were called to a dispute between roommates.
