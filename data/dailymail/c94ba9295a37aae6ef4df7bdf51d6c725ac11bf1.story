The World Cup last summer should have been a period of down time for the Premier League boss, and in some ways it was — but it was also an opportunity for reflection.

Richard Scudamore had been in charge of the top flight for 15 years as English football’s most enduring senior administrator. But now there was a possibility his time was up.

First, there was the sexist emails affair, in which he forwarded messages he acknowledges were inappropriate, containing jokes derogatory to women. He apologised at the time for the nature of those emails and will not discuss the issue in depth now.

The scandal prompted his first period of reflection and he was able to carry on in his job because there was never any desire among his paymasters, the Premier League clubs, for his removal.

‘Of course I was extremely encouraged by the support I received through what was a challenging summer,’ said Scudamore. ‘That was from, firstly, colleagues and clubs. Ultimately there was a wider group of interested people.

‘What matters is the 20 clubs and the 100 people who work at the Premier League.’

But, as he indicates, there was another reason to question his future. Shortly after the email furore sprung up, he was at the Royal Brompton Hospital for heart surgery. This was routine and planned but still carried significant risks.

‘I wasn’t scared because the Royal Brompton has fantastic people,’ said Scudamore. ‘But does it give you time to reflect? Yeah. You don’t know whether you are going to come out of it and you don’t know whether you’ll have that energy you had before. I took stock. 

‘In fairness to the clubs, I said, “I’ll go away, I’ll take stock and let’s see how I feel when I get back”. I was back doing bits within a couple of weeks.

‘Probably after two months, by the time I did the season launch, I pretty much knew I was going to be OK.’

Scudamore shows no sign of slowing down. The day we meet, he is on his way to Ypres in Belgium, where the Premier League Under 12 teams are on an extended weekend, which includes an inter-club qualifying tournament as well as an educational trip to the First World War battlefields and memorials.

The Premier League’s Christmas Truce tournament has become so established that the league has funded an artificial pitch in nearby Poperinge, where the games are played. The facility was opened by Scudamore last week.

Problems keep arising, too. Last year he appeared to be at loggerheads with FA chairman Greg Dyke, declining to serve on his FA Commission to improve the England team. Now the mood seems more conciliatory. 

Rangers and Celtic joining the Premier League 'is definitely not on the agenda', says Scudamore

‘When you step back, what does Greg want to achieve?’ said Scudamore. ‘He wants to achieve more and better homegrown players. Well, the reality is, if you look at the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP, the Premier League youth strategy established in 2011), that’s the opening line, the opening objective: more and better homegrown players, who are able to hold their own in Premier League first teams and qualify to play for England.

‘The only thing that really got tetchy was the tactics . . . of a big, grand opening statement. Our view was that he (Dyke) hadn’t gone and looked under the lid to see what was there already.

‘You can’t argue with what he’s trying to achieve and that’s why it feels different a year on.’

However, the Premier League is still seen by many as the principal stumbling block for the England team. The accusation is that while Scudamore is busy banking ever more extraordinary TV deals, England can rot. Scudamore takes on the point with passion.

‘You can plot the traces of the EPPP. I can date it: November 21, 2007, England v Croatia, 2-3, in the rain. I was there with a number of people. We went ballistic. That’s when we went away and recruited Ged Roddy (who oversees the EPPP and youth academies) and said, “We’ve got to do something to get the thing back up”. 

Scudamore defends foreign owners like Roman Abramovich at Chelsea

‘We care as passionately as anybody about England winning. You sit and watch these tournaments and wish we could do better but there is a limit to what we can realistically do.

‘Players have to be developed at clubs — they are the hub of development. In the early days it’s schools, which is why we’re heavily investing in school sport. We want to build that because we do want a better England team.’

Scudamore is English and knows how to tiptoe through the topic. What do owners such as Roman Abramovich, John W Henry, Stan Kroenke, Bryan Glazer and Sheik Mansour think about the issue?

‘You said “foreign owners” but it’s nothing to do with foreign owners this issue. It’s irrelevant. Clubs’ owners first and foremost want their clubs to win. But there are an awful lot of owners who understand that a successful England team would make the glow in which the Premier League is seen a more positive one.’

Ticket prices is the issue almost every English football fan would want to raise with Scudamore.

He expresses his frustration that most surveys quote top-end prices when the League deliberately encourages clubs to charge expensive executive prices so they can make more, cheaper tickets available. ‘It’s like going on to the British Airways website and just asking for the first-class single airfare,’ he said. 

The rise of West Ham and Southampton this season helps sell the Premier League around the world

‘It is undoubtedly true and I cannot deny that since the Premier League was formed, the overall dynamic for the attending fan has altered. What is absolutely true is that season on season we have lost what some might describe as some of our core, traditional fans. 

‘But what is also undeniably true is that we’ve picked up far more. Is it a real topic? Yes, it is. Are the clubs listening? Yes, they are. Are they doing everything that the fans would want them to do? Of course, they’re not.’

Celtic and Rangers joining the Premier League is definitely not on the agenda — ‘I can see what’s in it for them; I can’t see what’s in it for us’ — and nor, he says, is the 39th Game or an international round of Premier League games.

‘There’s no economic imperative to play games abroad but there is a marketing (argument),’ he said. ‘I’m not here saying the person who’s had a season ticket for the last 30 years isn’t more important than our fan base in Asia or America. But you can’t ignore them.’

Intriguingly, Scudamore bangs the drum for globalisation by invoking Communism. He links the rise of Southampton, Swansea and West Ham this season to growing international revenues, which are distributed equally, as opposed to the domestic TV deal, which is weighted towards the big clubs. 

Southampton qualfying for the Champions League would help boost the Premier League

Though he remains doggedly impartial, he gives the impression he would view as it as a success for the Premier League model should Southampton qualify for the Champions League.

‘When the season ends, whoever has won it, and people say what do you want to happen next year, I just say, “I want somebody else to win it”. And that goes for Champions League places as well. I’d like to see a different four teams in the Champions League.

‘You have to be a little bit careful as you also want your best teams, your strongest teams, in the Champions League, because you want us to do well.

‘But generally we want to change it up. We don’t care who wins as long as it isn’t the same clubs every time.

‘I’ve sat here for 10 years saying the more we develop internationally, the more revenues are distributed evenly. It is a far more communist/taxed system, where the big clubs are being taxed internationally to pay for the smaller clubs. The advantage is the gap narrows. Therefore, you do get more chance for a small club, a middle club, to beat the top clubs.’

Scudamore appears to be ready for a new phase. In time, the ‘challenging summer’ may prove a footnote
