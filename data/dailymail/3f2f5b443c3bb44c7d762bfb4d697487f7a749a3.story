Russell Brand was left tongue-tied after being called to explain major flaws in his planned 'revolution'.

The comedian plans to overthrow the Government as he claims 'parliamentary democracy doesn't work'.

He also vows to legalise drugs by petitioning for a debate on the matter in the House of Commons.

Irate: Russell Brand raised his voice and gestured wildly as Jon Snow suggested the comic accidentally supported politicians with a petition calling for a drug law debate in the House of Commons

But in a heated interview last night, he struggled to explain his strategy when Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow accused the actor of accidentally supporting the government with his 'confused' manifesto.

Snow, 66, suggested the petition for a debate on drug laws will stimulate politics, rather than block it.

Visibly irate, Brand lashed out: 'I came on here to promote (the drug law campaign) and we don't even need to promote it.

'I don't even need to be here. I refuse to be drawn on this subject.

'You know that parliamentary democracy doesn't truly help people. Don't tell me that politics works. Just don't.'

Snow went on to ask the Forgetting Sarah Marshall actor how he planned to change drug laws when he refuses to vote.

Snow suggested Brand will not be able to bring about reform as he currently refuses to vote. Brand rebuffed the statement, restating that politicians are 'out of touch'

The Forgetting Sarah Marshall actor admitted there are some discrepancies in the anti-drug laws petition

Eventually, the comic accused Snow of deliberately making him look foolish for entertainment

He added: 'There's confusion here 
Russell. You say you don't vote, but you are asking people to sign a 
petition so that politicians, that you don't want them to vote for, are 
going to have to debate.

'In
 effect you are doing the Government's work for them because the very 
people you are saying don't vote are young people suffering from the 
cuts.'

Brand replied: 'That's not what I'm doing. I'm demonstrating that politicians are completely out of touch.'

Snow shot a disparaging look, as Brand admitted: 'There may be some inconsistencies because I’m a man who doesn’t believe in parliamentary democracy – thinks it’s a charade – but what I want is change around this issue and I’m prepared to use the materials in front of me.'

He then accused Snow of deliberately trying to make him look foolish: 'Look - listen, you. Let me talk. [Drug law reform] is more important than you, an entertainer, getting me, another entertainer, to cook up a wacky version of politics so you can make me look a bit daft.'

Snow said: 'There's confusion here Russell... In effect you are doing the Government's work for them'

The comedian, here performing his Messiah Complex tour last week, vows to overthrow the government

Backlash: He has been accused of using his celebrity status on shows like Question Time (pictured) to destabilise politicians

Asked if he still wanted a revolution, Brand replied: 'You know I do. That's the reason that I'm here.

'I want a revolution in the way we regard addiction as a disease, the way we treat drug addicts.'

The funnyman-turned-activist sparked outrage when he revealed his anarchic intentions on Newsnight last year.

He told the BBC: 'I'm angry, because for me it’s real. This is what I come from... there is going to be a revolution.

'Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending, wake up, be in reality now. Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference.' 

Politicians and fellow Left-wingers, including Peep Show actor Robert Webb, have blasted Brand for dangerously threatening to derail society by using his celebrity status.
