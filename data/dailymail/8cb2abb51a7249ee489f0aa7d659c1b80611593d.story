Paul Hollywood has revealed that he is losing the feeling in his hands – a symptom of his 30-year career as a baker.

The Great British Bake Off judge said that decades spent kneading dough has left him  with severe nerve damage in his wrists which would lead to a complete loss of sensation in his hands if untreated.

The 47-year-old will now undergo career-saving surgery in the new year.

Hollywood revealed his diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome at the Good Food Show in London where he resorted to using a food mixer to demonstrate how to make puff pastry.

An advocate of mixing and kneading by hand, he apologised to fans for not practising what  he preaches. ‘This is a dough which has been made earlier, I would normally manipulate it and knead it myself but I’ve had a few problems,’ he said. ‘I actually have carpal tunnel syndrome in both my wrists.

‘I went to get it tested about two years ago and they gave  me electric shock treatment  from your finger down to your elbow to see how severe it is. The doctor said “If you don’t have an operation you will no longer have feeling in your hands for the rest of your life”.

‘I have been wearing wrist strengtheners on both my wrists. Thirty years of baking has now knackered me, and I have to go for an operation to have them sorted.’

Hollywood revealed that fellow Bake Off judge Mary Berry  also had the operation for the condition and encouraged him to have it done.

Confessing he was a little apprehensive about surgery, he said: ‘[Mary] said it really hurt and absolutely killed her. But I think she is winding me up.’

Miss Berry, 78, who was demonstrating alongside Hollywood, quipped: ‘Normally you have it under general anaesthetic and you have a nurse holding your hand. Knowing you it will be a very pretty nurse.’

This month Hollywood admitted to cheating on his wife of 15 years Alexandra, 49, with Marcela Valladolid, his co-judge on the American version of Bake Off which he filmed earlier this year.

Around one in 20 Britons are affected by carpal tunnel syndrome which causes pain and numbness in the hands.

It is caused by the compression of one of the nerves in the hands called the median nerve.

The condition is very common in pregnant women – around half experience symptoms – and it often occurs during the menopause.

It is also common among adults who do a lot of strenuous work with their hands, for example typing or kneading bread.

Often it will disappear without treatment. In pregnant women it usually goes away within the first three months, while mild symptoms can be controlled with wrist splints or steroid injections. More severe cases may require surgery to cut a ligament to ease pressure on the nerve.
