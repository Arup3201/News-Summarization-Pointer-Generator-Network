Former glamour model Peta Todd has been given the green light to take part in the final round of this year’s World Rally Championship.

Todd, married to Tour de France superstar Mark Cavendish, will team up with Tony Jardine, the Sky Sports F1 pundit, in Wales later this week.

‘There’s still a lot of homework to do, but I cannot wait to tackle Wales Rally GB, which is what everything else has been about,’ said Todd, who will be Jardine’s co-driver at the WRC finale which gets underway on Thursday.

Todd has successfully taken part in three trial rallies and will team up with Sky Sports pundit Tony Jardine 

Todd successfully completed three trial rallies alongside Jardine and obtained her final signature required to take part earlier this week. 

In last year's event, Skeleton gold medallist Amy Williams partnered Jardine. The pair finished first in their class.  

‘I can focus on co-driving and leave the driving to Tony,’ Todd added. ‘I’m relieved to have got this far, given the ups and downs we’ve had, and over the moon to have received my fourth signature.'

Todd formerly appeared as a Page 3 model for The Sun. She had a baby with Cavendish, the 2011 BBC Sports Personality of the Year, in 2012 before tying the knot later that year.
