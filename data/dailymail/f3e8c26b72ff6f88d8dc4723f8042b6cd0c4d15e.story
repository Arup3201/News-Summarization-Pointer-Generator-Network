The presents may have been well and truly opened, but the footballers are wrapping up.

With the temperature in Britain beginning its inevitable decline as we frostily shuffle into the new year, some of the Premier League's biggest stars kept themselves safe from the cold winter air by donning football's old familiar friend - the snood.

Concluding their final session for this year, the Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City players made their way out to the training pitches to prepare themselves for the second half of the Premier League season.

In London Colney, Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny lead a cluster of his Arsenal team-mates out, bearing a stark resemblance to when a certain steely-eyed Bruce Willis did that slow-motion walk in Armageddon.

With his side heading into 2015 just outside of a Champions League place, Arsene Wenger's men were in high spirits as the Frenchman took them through their paces.

Manchester City also braved the cold at their new £200million Etihad Campus training complex, with Argentinian duo Martin Demichelis and Pablo Zabaleta both sporting a lovely stripey number... in blue and white, of course.

Pick of the bunch was Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho who, unlike that all-too-familiar scene with Mario Balotelli and an unforgiving bib, had no struggle putting on his kit while his team got ready for their clash with Tottenham on Thursday.

The Blues have it all to lose as they march on into next year, proudly perched at the top of the table three points ahead of Manchester City.
