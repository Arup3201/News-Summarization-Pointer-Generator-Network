The mother of the Muslim convert who brought terror to Canada's parliament divorced her husband after admitting an affair - just two years before her son's life began to spiral out of control.

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's mother, Susan Bibeau, made the stark admission: 'I committed adultery' in the papers filed in her divorce from Bulgasem Zehaf.

They pulled Zehaf-Bibeau out mid-year from his $5,000 a year private school which had 'Army-like' discipline - and sent him to a down-at-heel public school instead.

Strict: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was pulled out of the 'Army-like' $5,000-a-year College Laval private school because of his parents' divorce - a result of his mother's adultery, according to court papers

Descent to hell: Zehaf-Bibeau started out on a life of criminality withn two years of his parents' split which led to crack cocaine addiction and eventually such radicalization that he became a jihadi killer

Turbulent: Zehaf-Bibeau moved in with his mother after the divorce but soon moved out. She admitted earlier this week that she hadn't spoken to him for five years apart from oncelast week

The divorce was finalized in June 1999 and just two years later Zehaf-Bibeau was arrested for assault causing actual bodily harm in his first criminal offence, paving the way for his later radicalization.

He would have been just 16 at the time and his parents' split wrenched him away from his family life, his friends and his school.

Even today the wounds appear to be raw. Susan Bibeau, now one of Canada's top immigration officials, has admitted that she has not seen her son for the past five years as he became increasingly radicalized and drifted across Canada, his only mark on society being his growing list of crimes.

His life reached its terrifying conclusion on Wednesday when he shot dead Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, as he was standing guard at the National War Memorial in Ottawa.

Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, walked a short distance to Parliament and unleashed an estimated 50 rounds from his Winchester.30 caliber rifle before being shot dead.

It was one of the most brazen terrorist attacks on a Western country in the last few years - but now investigators are trying to work out why Zehaf-Bibeau did it.

He came from a middle class family and grew up in Laval, a suburb of Montreal in Quebec and seemed to have the world at his feet. Former classmates described him as 'smiley' and somebody who 'fitted in'. 

The 2000 yearbook (photo provided by CBC) from his senior year at Ecole Secondaire Saint Maxime in Laval said that he 'will go far in life' and that he is a 'sociable and intelligent guy'.

But the year before that his life was turned upside down when his parents split up.

Zehaf-bibeau's Libyan father wrote in an affidavit that Susan Bibeau 'confessed' what she did to him and that afterwards he could not be with her any more.

In the resulting acrimony, Zehaf-Bibeau was removed from College Laval, an exclusive private school where students have to take an entrance exam, in the middle of the 1998/1999 academic year.

Former classmate Vito Garofalo said that during his time at College Laval Bibeau would have had no opportunity to get involved in criminality because the regime was so strict.

The 31-year-old realtor said: 'We had to wear a suit all year, even in the summer. It was like being in the Army and it was very strict.

'We had a merit system and we started the year with 25 points. If you did something wrong you lost points, so if you got in a fight you lost 10 points, and if you didn't do your homework you lost two points.

'Anyone who had zero points was expelled. It was a tough place'.

Zehaf-Bibeau was put into Saint Maxime which has been known for pupils fighting with other students from local schools.

As he adjusted to his new life, papers filed at the Montreal Justice Palace show that painful mediation was ongoing over his parents' divorce.

His mother, already a successful official in the Canadian immigration service, paid his father $40,000 for his share of the smart three-bedroom house so she could keep it, and Zehaf-Bibeau appears to have lived there with her.

In a sign that perhaps she accepted blame for the breakup, she did not ask for child support even though under Quebec law she was entitled to it.

Zehaf kept his Ford Crown 89 and his Porsche 944 whilst she kept the Mazda MX-3. He kept the cafe that he ran, though it later closed down.

In one of his statements Zahaf says that, as of the age of 16, Zehaf-Bibeau had no criminal record and had never appeared before a youth court. The family had also not been investigated by social services.

But that all changed soon after.

Zehaf-Bibeau's first conviction was in 2001 when he was 19 – the assault during an incident in Montreal. That same year he was convicted of possessing a false credit card and impaired driving.

Over the next 13 years he racked up 13 offences in Quebec including his most serious crime, a 2003 robbery, for which he was jailed for two years and put on probation for three.

Zehaf-Bibeau drifted between jobs and traveled to Vancouver, where he briefly worked as a laborer and developed a crack cocaine drug addiction. At some point during these turbulent years he converted from Catholicism to Islam.

A mosque in Vancouver, British Columbia, kicked him out. 'His behaviour was not normal,’ said David Ali, vice-president of Masjid Al-Salaam mosque in nearby Burnaby.

He said: 'We try to be open to everyone. But people on drugs don't behave normally.'

In 2011, Zehaf-Bibeau tried to rob a McDonald's restaurant in the city so he could get clean from his addiction while in jail.

A psychiatrist deemed him fit to stand trial and after being convicted he was sentenced to time served, which was 66 days in jail. A transcript of the hearing reveals he was by then deeply troubled. 

Victim: Father-of-one Cpl Nathan Cirillo was shot in the back by Zehaf-Bibeau. He died of his injuries later

Ominous: Responders frantically tried reviving Cirillo at the base of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier

Wasted life: Cpl Cirillo's mother, Kathy, weeps behind the young soldier's coffin as it is walked out to the hearse in his hometown of Hamilton, Canada, on Friday

Honor: Crowds of well-wishers pay their respects as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo's casket is transported by hearse from Ottawa to Hamilton via the Highway of Heroes in Ottawa

He says: 'My plan is...I'm a crack addict, and at the same time I'm a religious person. I want to sacrifice freedom and good things, for a year maybe, so when I come out I'll appreciate things of life more, and be clean, or maybe get a therapy like a detox, if you guys could send me to one.'

Zehaf-Bibeau's last known home was a homeless shelter in Ottawa where he vacillated between preaching and doing drugs.

But by then, according to CNN, he had already developed 'connections' to Canadian jihadists, including one who had gone to Syria to fight and is currently on the run. 

The extent of their influence on him is something that investigators will be working out.

Among those who have spoken out in support of Zehaf-Bibeau has been his aunt Monique, although when visited by MailOnline she refused to come to the door.

A fierce husky dog on a chain prowled the driveway of her picturesque lakeside home in the mountain resort of Mont Tremblant.

Monique Bibeau has been told not to talk about her nephew's visit by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), according to a neighbor.

The neighbor said: 'The Mounties were here this morning. They told Monique not to talk about Michael's visit. She is very upset. He would often come here when he was young.'

Mrs Bideau has described how her bearded nephew turned up at her remote mountain home 'out of the blue' the night before the terrorist attack.

She told La Presse: 'He just turned up (on Tuesday night). He said he wanted to pay me a visit. It had been a long time since we'd seen each other.

'I hardly recognized him. He had changed. He had long hair and a beard. He was no longer my little nephew. But in ten years you change.'

She added that had spent several years in the west of Canada working in the oil industry as he drifted around.

Monique Bibeau said: 'He said vaguely that he had plans to return. I am totally against what he did but he is still my nephew and always will be. He was like any other kid.'

Court records also seen by MailOnline show that Zehaf's first marriage before he met Susan Bibeau ended badly too..

He wed Susan Simmons in January 1984 but in November the following year they divorced.

In his affidavit Zehaf states: 'The reason for the divorce was physical cruelty and mental cruelty'.

Neither party saw any chance of reconciliation.

Zehaf has been described as a businessman who appears to have fought in Libya in 2011 for the rebels.

He also made numerous trips to Libya over the previous decade and Bibeau is said to have joined him on some.

Zehaf-Bibeau had traveled to Ottawa to apply for a Libyan passport because he wanted to go to the country to study Islam, but was rejected for undisclosed reasons. But it has been reported that he had also told his mother he wanted to go to Syria - where ISIS is currently running rampage.

His passport had been seized but he was not among the dozens of Islamic radicals being watched by Canadian intelligence.

In a joint statement Susan Bibeau and Zehaf spoke of their horror at what their son has done.

Susan Bibeau said: 'If I’m crying, it's for the people (killed and hurt). Not for my son.'
