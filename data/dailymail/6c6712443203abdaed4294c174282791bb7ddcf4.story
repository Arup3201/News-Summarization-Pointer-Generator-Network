Thrill-seeker: Phillip Hawkes drowned after he jumped 100 feet into the sea

A British tourist drowned after he jumped up to 100 feet from a cliff face into the sea.

Phillip Hawkes, 25, who was nicknamed Captain Caterpillar, had travelled with his best friend to Majorca in June to try free climbing craze, Deep Water Soloing.

Tragedy struck when Mr Hawkes from Leigh in Greater Manchester, struggled to get out of the water using a rope ladder fixed to nearby rocks.

After talking to his friend, Edward Bailey, 25, the Lancaster graduate decided the best option was for him to swim to a nearby cave.

However, he got into difficulties and was found lying face down and lifeless in the water by coastguards.

He was pronounced dead at the scene after attempts to resuscitate him failed.

Mr Hawkes, who had been working in Scotland as a climbing instructor, and was due to be best man at Mr Bailey’s wedding wanted to be the first of the two friends to free climb on the first day of their holiday.

Mr Bailey who is a trained outdoor climber said the climbing routes they were hoping to complete on the holiday were quite low on the grading spectrum.

He told the Bolton inquest: ‘This climb was around a 6A grade and we were both able to climb grades 6C and 7A - the route was well within our comfort rate. We were deliberately cautious since we had never done it before.

‘When we climbed together, we were very close in ability - but in terms of strength I would have been slightly higher. However what he lacked in strength, he more than beat me in confidence, in terms of going for it.’

Tragedy: After Mr Hawkes allowed himself to fall up to 100 feet, he struggled to get out of the water using a rope ladder fixed to nearby rocks

On examining the crag, they decided they would need rope to help aide them to a ledge located further down.

Mr Bailey said: ‘Philip wanted to go first; he was really, really excited about it and was really enthusiastic. He had a lot of confidence in climbing so he wanted to go for it.’

The hearing was told Philip removed his climbing shoes off, wedged them into a gap where the ropes were attached to the rock, and jumped.

Cautious: Mr Hawkes and his friend chose climbing routhes that were well within their comfort rate. After he landed in the water, the pair decided it best he swim round the cliff to a nearby cave

Mr Bailey said there were three ropes -
two in the form of a ladder - secured to the rock which dropped to the 
water to enable easy access back up on to the rock.

As he struggled with the ropes, Mr Bailey said: ‘He was a little bit frustrated, but he was still chatty and chirpy.

‘His nickname at university was Captain Caterpillar because he was very long in the body and when he used to climb his backside would stick out - and it was - he was finding it difficult to get into an upright position on the rope.’

Unclear: It is not known exactly how Mr Hawkes died as when he began swimming he moved out of sight of his friend

After the pair, who did not have 
phones on them, decided that it would be best for Philip to swim round 
the cliff, Mr Bailey made his way along the cliff top to the cave which 
was around 200 feet away. On the way he saw a German couple and told 
them to alert the emergency services.

When he got to the cave, there was no sign of Mr Hawkes.

He said: ‘He didn't appear. It shouldn't have taken him very long’.

Deep Water Soloing is a relatively 
new style of climbing but it is believed to have originated in the late 
1960s or early 1970s in Dorset, Southern England or Majorca.

The activity involves climbing on sea 
cliffs with no ropes and only climbing shoes and chalk as aides – but at
high tide so the water cushions climbers from serious injury.

Normally a dinghy is used to pick up 
the fallen climber as a fall from a taller route can still knock the 
climber out, causing them to drown.

The
practise is sometimes named ‘Psicobloc’, which, when translated 
literally from Spanish into English, means ‘Psycho Bouldering’.

Recording a verdict of accidental death coroner Alison Mulch said: ‘Philip has been described as a very competent and confident climber. From his friend's evidence, we've heard that they had gone on holiday with the intention of deep water soloing.

‘They had prepared for that - they didn't go in blindly. Both he and Philip prepared as much as they could for this. We've heard that Philip jumped into the water and seemed to be enjoying swimming in the water.

‘He struggled to get out of the water, notwithstanding the fact that the ropes were in the water. His friend created a rope using slings. He dropped them into the water. Philip appeared to find them easier to use but was still struggling.

‘Philip dropped back into the water and the two of them reached the decision that Philip would swim to a spot about 50-70 metres away to a cave which would allow Philip easier access out of the water.

‘This was not a reckless decision by Philip - the sea appeared calm, Philip felt confident swimming in the water.

‘At that point he started swimming to the cave knowing exactly where he was swimming to on his back.

‘His friends ascended back up the rock and went to the cave. Phil was then out of sight , so it's unclear what happened.’
