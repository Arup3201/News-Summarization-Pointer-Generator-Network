Byron, 47, only discovered his tongue was the widest in the world when he picked up a copy of the Guinness Book of World Records while helping Emily with a school project at the library. 

After measuring his tongue, he found it was nearly a centimetre wider than the then record holder's. 

Since his tongue was officially dubbed the world's widest he has become something of a celebrity in his hometown of Syracuse, New York.

The project manager said: 'The book goes all over the world and it's neat to see people's responses on Facebook and things like that.'

His daughter added: 'I didn't want anything to do with it at first but we measured my tongue and found out that it was wider [than the then record holder's].'

Byron's wife Vicki says her friends 'make jokes about Byron's tongue and our love life', but she won't be drawn on the insinuations.

She said: 'We try to keep it clean. We are a wholesome family with three young ladies in the house so we just kind of laugh it off.'
