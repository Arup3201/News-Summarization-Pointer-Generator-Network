South African judge Thokozile Masipa says she will respond to the prosecution's appeal against the Oscar Pistorius verdict on Wednesday.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the Pretoria High Court the decision to acquit Pistorius of the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, should be overturned.  Nel also argues that Paralympic star's punishment was 'shockingly inappropriate'.

Masipa, who presided over the Pistorius trial, will also decide whether the case can be heard at the Supreme Court of Appeal.

Pistorius' defence lawyer, Barry Roux, argued against allowing the prosecution to appeal against the verdict and sentence. 

The Paralympian admits shooting girlfriend Steenkamp four times with hollow point bullets through a locked toilet door on Valentine's Day 2013. He told the court he thought she was an intruder.

Masipa found him guilty of culpable homicide, also known as manslaughter, and sentenced him to five years in jail, meaning that he could end up spending only 10 months of his jail term at Pretoria's central prison.

May 8 - A social worker who visited Pistorius in the aftermath of the killing describes the murder suspect as 'heartbroken'.

Yvette van Schalkwyk, who says she decided to give evidence at the trial because she was upset by suggestions reported in the media that Pistorius was feigning grief to sway the judge in his favour, adds: 'He cried 80% of the time.
