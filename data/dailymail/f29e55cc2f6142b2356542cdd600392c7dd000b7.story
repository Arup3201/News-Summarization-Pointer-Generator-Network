Ben Foster urged me to be more positive about England after my MailOnline column last week. I thought about it for a while, I considered England’s worst ever showing at a World Cup, and realised I didn’t have a clue what he was talking about at all.

So I asked him to come on to my radio show and give me the reasons to be positive. It all went quiet from Foster. Funny that.

Of course there were positives – Raheem Sterling did well, Ross Barkley showed flashes, Wayne Rooney managed to score at a World Cup (I’m scraping the barrel a bit here…).

Really? England goalkeeper Ben Foster says critics should look at the positives from England's World Cup campaign

Foster’s plea to me displayed the lack of self-awareness that affects a lot of England players.

It’s not qualifying for a World Cup they are judged on, it’s what they do when they get there. I never expected England to win the tournament but I didn’t expect us to go out after two games. How can I be positive about that?

For Foster as an individual, the Hodgson connection granted him the incredible fortune to get an England reprieve and he took John Ruddy’s place in Brazil, despite the Norwich keeper turning up for all the qualifiers without a chance of playing.

Foster kept a clean sheet in a dead rubber game against a Costa Rica side who, once they realised England weren't intent on flying into challenges full force, barely got out of second gear.

Is that what he wants me to be positive about? If so, well done Ben, but that’s not what defines positivity for England at this World Cup. Maybe he was out of the England loop a bit too long and just doesn’t understand.

For Foster, England was something he could opt in and out of. But for fans it’s a lifetime commitment, and players should respect that a little bit more.

For all the plaudits this World Cup has had - some of us have admired the football played, and the attacking spirit of the games - it was still rubbish for England fans. I was in Rio for most of the tournament, and possibly got caught up in the moment.

But upon my return to England I realised that for us to go out and come home so quickly was a total embarrassment, and to miss out on being a bigger part of this fantastic tournament in Brazil is a huge disappointment.

I could say England played well and the games could have gone either way.

But the truth is we had six months to prepare for Andrea Pirlo and Luis Suarez and we couldn’t handle either of them. That’s pitiful.

I said before the tournament I was not putting any pressure on the team, I only expected them not to embarrass us as they did in 2010. 

But going out after two games was an embarrassment.

I’m happy to give Hodgson another crack at it though for Euro 2016, I believe he will have learned from his mistakes.

And the invitation to Foster to come on my show and tell me all the positives from England’s World Cup is still open. I am happy to be educated by him and I’m disappointed he has so far bottled the chance.

And there is a lesson to be learned from Foster’s words – or lack of them. If England are going to turn failure into success, players will need to show courage when rising to a challenge.

I hope the rest are made of stronger stuff.
