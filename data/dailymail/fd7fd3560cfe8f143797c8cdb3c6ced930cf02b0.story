Walking your dog, enjoying wine with a picnic and even meeting friends in the street have been turned into offences in a sweeping expansion of police and Town Hall powers, a report warned last night.

A study by the Manifesto Club revealed widespread use of a string of little-noticed laws introduced by the last Labour government.

The group warned that ‘ordinary freedoms and legal protections have been suspended in large areas of public space’.

Wrong? Enjoying wine with a picnic or meeting friends in the street have been turned into offences in a sweeping expansion of police and Town Hall powers

Most of the laws were passed under the banner of Labour’s ‘respect’ agenda which aimed to crack down on anti-social behaviour.

For example, rules banning drinking in public places were supposed to target teenage drinking in parks.

But the powers are so widely drawn that they can be trained on families enjoying a picnic.

The Manifesto Club said there is particular concern that many of the zones - which are decided by the authorities drawing lines on a map - are not clearly marked.

This means members of the public can commit an offence without knowing they have done anything wrong. Several pensioners have been caught out by ‘no-dog’ zones they did not know about.

The penalties can be harsh.

‘Drinking in a designated public place' is a criminal offence, and usually punished by an on-the-spot fine. The maximum penalty is £500 in some areas. It would be logged on the Police National Computer.

Dog walking in an area where it is banned, such as straying into a play area in a public park, is a civil matter. But in all cases the person would end up in court if they didn't pay the fine – which means a potential criminal record.

Walking the dog: The Manifesto Club warned that 'ordinary freedoms and legal protections have been suspended in large areas of public space'

Josie Appleton, director of the Manifesto Club, said: ‘Ordinary freedoms and legal protections have been suspended in large areas of public space.

'An everyday activity can be an offence if you do it on the wrong street. When officials have such open-ended powers, they can make up the law as they see fit'

Josie Appleton, Manifesto Club

‘An everyday activity can be an offence if you do it on the wrong street. When officials have such open-ended powers, they can make up the law as they see fit.

‘At the very least, these zones should all be marked: it is fundamentally unjust that people could be punished for offences they did not know they were committing. In the long run, we need a serious debate about whether we want these controls spreading across our public spaces.’

Local authorities across the UK have enacted the zones.

In London alone, the authorities have declared 435 special ‘zones’ which ban the public from taking part in what are normally considered law-abiding activities.

Combined, the exclusion zones cover half of the capital.

The Manifesto Club used Freedom of Information laws to discover there are:

•        110 leafleting zones, within which people must buy a council licence if they want to leaflet. There were 37 fines for the offence of 'unlicensed leafleting' in 2011-12.

•        32 dispersal zones, within which groups of two or more people can be asked to leave the area and not return for 24 hours. There have been 547 recent orders to disperse.

•        219 dog exclusion zones, within which people cannot walk their dogs. There were 56 fines for the offence of walking dogs in a no-dog zone in 2011-12.

•        74 alcohol confiscation zones, within which people can have their alcohol confiscated. The Metropolitan Police issued 663 fines for the offence of drinking in public in 2010, and there are several thousand alcohol confiscations each year.

The Manifesto Club has delivered a string of warnings about how the public is being subjected to increasingly draconian powers.

Earlier this year, the group warned how armies of civilian ‘busybodies’ with as little as five days’ training have been handed sweeping police powers which allow them to destroy people’s careers.

Freedom of Information responses reveal there are now 2,617 snoopers licensed under Labour’s hugely controversial Community Safety Accreditation Schemes – a rise of 1,000 in only three years.

They include park wardens, shopping centre staff, park attendants and housing association staff accredited to hand out fines for 'crimes' such as littering, dog fouling and criminal damage.

The civilians do not answer to a police constable – and four out of five forces do not bother to keep track on what they are doing once they have been given their powers.
