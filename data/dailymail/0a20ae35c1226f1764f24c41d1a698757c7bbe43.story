Indiana Pacers star Paul George saw his World Cup hopes end after suffering a horrific leg break during the USA team's training camp in Las Vegas.

George, a two-time NBA All Star, was taking part in an inter-squad practice game when he sustained the shocking injury after landing awkwardly.

He was then led out of the arena on a stretcher as the rest of the USA team watched on shocked at what they had seen.
