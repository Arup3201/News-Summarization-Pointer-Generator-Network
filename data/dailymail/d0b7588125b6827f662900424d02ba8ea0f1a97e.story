She's become a global style icon known for her polished looks and Queen Letizia of Spain's appearance today was no different.

Looking composed in a plum-coloured suit, the Spanish monarch joined her husband at the ceremony of the Gold Medal of Merit in Fine Arts Ceremony at El Pardo Palace in Madrid, Spain.

The 42-year-old, who had clearly carefully co-ordinated her outfit, matched her lipstick and accessories to her clothes.

Despite cramming in several royal duties over the past few weeks - as well as helping her husband celebrate his birthday on Friday - the monarch was practically glowing as she presented awards at the event.

The couple beamed and applauded as they handed out awards to creatives and proved they're still very much in love as they gazed longingly into each other's eyes.

The couple are barely seen apart. At the end of last week, the couple visited the FITUR International Tourism Fair in Madrid when a well-wisher in a grey robe approached, brandishing a map.

Ever composed, Letizia and husband King Felipe, who celebrated his 47th birthday on Friday, smiled broadly at the man before inspecting the map and moving on.

Before that, she compered a meeting of the Spanish Association Against Cancer, an organisation of which she is president. 

Since taking the throne in June 2014 after former King Juan Carlos tearfully signed his abdication papers following a 36-year reign, Spain's Felipe and Letizia have become two of Europe's most popular royals.

But Felipe and Letizia have been lauded for their hard work, the couple, who have two daughters, Leonor, nine, and Sofia, seven, have also been praised for their good looks and impeccable dress sense.

Felipe, 46, became engaged to 42-year-old Letizia Ortiz y Rocasolano, an award-winning broadcast journalist in 2003, after meeting when she carried out an interview with him.

The couple married a year later in 2004 at the Almudena Cathedral, Madrid, in a ceremony that was beamed around the world - with over 25 million viewers in Spain alone tuning in.

Since then, Letizia has become a global style icon thanks to her penchant for mixing home-grown labels and the high street. 

Favourites include slim-fitting sheath dresses picked up in Mango, Zara and Uterqüe - many of which she wears time and time again.
