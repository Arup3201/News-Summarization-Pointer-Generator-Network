Gunman Anders Breivik had a second larger bomb that was ready to be deployed at his farm, a Norwegian TV channel has reported

Norwegian gunman Anders Breivik had prepared a second bomb that was bigger than the one which detonated in Oslo killing eight people.

Public broadcaster NRK reported yesterday that military sources had discovered a 3,300lb device at his farm around 85 miles north of the city.

By comparison, the bomb which went off in the capital weighted 2,095lbs according to estimates.

Despite the claims, the Norwegian police denied that they had found any device.

Using Twiter, spokesman Roar Hanssen said: 'A lot of modified fertiliser was found at the farm

'However that is just one of many bomb components. Important elements were missing and it still needed a lot of work before that became a bomb able to be deployed.'

The reports of the second bomb came as a judge denied a request by the extremsist to wear formal tailcoat for his appearance on Friday.

Judge Hugo Abelseth called the suggestion 'disturbing' as he also closed the court for Breivik's appearance.

He said: 'In light of the extreme seriousness of the case, such an attire could be disturbing, insulting and provocative.'

Speaking after the refusal, Breivik's lawyer Geir Lippestead explained that the killer had wanted to wear the coat as he wanted to show his respect for the judicial process.

But Judge Abelseth stressed that 'ordinary, proper clothing is enough to show that he takes the judicial process seriously.'

Friday's hearing will determine if Brievik will remain in solitary confinement after the first four-week period has passed.

The gunman claimed on Tuesday that he called police in the middle of his bloody rampage to surrender after phoning police and telling them 'mission accomplished'.

The 32-year-old - who eventually murdered 69 people - spoke to a control worker.

The call ended - inexplicably, though Breivik claims he was ignored - and he was left expecting a call back.

However, officers couldn't get in touch with him again, it is claimed.

He went on to kill another 20 people on the island of Utoya after attempting to hand himself in.

Far-right extremist Breivik was apparently promised a call back after getting a 'garbled' response.

By the time officers did try and ring him back the phone was switched off, the Sun reported.

He apparently told them: 'Mission accomplished and I will surrender to the Delta force.'

The rampage went on for two-hours in total as Breivik killed 69 and injured dozens more after a bomb had been detonated in the centre of Oslo which killed another eight people.

He was eventually arrested after he had made a second call to officers.

On the police log of the call it said: 'A Norwegian-speaking man says that he will surrender to police'.

He
first got through to the control room at 17.58 before ringing again at 
18.26 shortly before he was arrested following his rampage on July 22.

Although he got through to police twice, Breivik has told police that he tried to ring at least ten times.

However,
the phone network was overwhelmed as hundreds of relatives of those on 
the island bombarded police with emergency calls.

Breivik faces up to 21 years in prison 
if he is convicted on terrorism charges, but an alternative custody 
arrangement — if he is still considered a danger to the public — could 
keep him behind bars indefinitely.

His lawyer has said he has 
admitted to the terror attacks, but denies criminal guilt because he 
believes the massacre was necessary to save Norway and Europe from 
Muslims and punish politicians who have embraced multiculturalism.

Initial
speculation suggested others were involved in the terror attacks, but 
prosecutors and police have said they are fairly certain that Breivik 
planned and committed them on his own.
