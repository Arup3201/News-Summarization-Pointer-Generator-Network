As Britons up and down the country prepare to bare their bodies on holiday, and the English sunshine remains as erratic as ever, more and more of us are embracing fake tanning.

And it seems the amount of fake tan you use can help to reveal where you live.

The women (and men!) of Scotland top the latest tanning charts, with the women of Glasgow buying more tanning products than anywhere else in the UK.

The the top five fake tanning cities of the UK

Other tanning addicts including Liverpudlians, who are the second most avid buyers of fake tan, followed by Manchester inhabitants.

Tan lovers in the North East stock up nearly twice as much as those in the South West with those in the west country proving to be the least fake tan reliant.

The new sales results from Superdrug also reveal that, perhaps inspired by the perma-tanned physiques of the cast of The Only Way Is Essex (TOWIE), Essex customers buy 20 per cent more fake tan than those in London.

Ferne McCann and Billie and Sam Faiers all looked ultra tanned as they attended an all-white themed Marbella party yesterday

Both Jasmine Walia and her friend wore nude peep-toe platforms to attend the party. TOWIE seems to have inspired Essex women's ever growing love of fake tan

Reality TV shows TOWIE, Made in Chelsea and Geordie Shore have had a massive effect on female grooming in those areas.

The TOWIE effect has seen sales of 
fake tan rise by five per cent compared to last year as ladies in Essex 
are looking to get the TOWIE look. While sales of fake tan in the 
Newcastle area has risen by six per cent and sales in the Fulham area 
have risen by four per cent.

The country isn't completely full of fakes however. As people become more aware of the dangers of sun exposure the pale English rose look has also started to come back into fashion.

And it seems the people of Middlesborough have embraced this ethereal look as they prove to be the least users of fake tan along with those in Southall, Margate, Bristol and Kent.

A spokesman for Superdrug said: ‘We know that ladies of Liverpool are renowned for their glamorous style and their hair and make-up is always pristine but it’s interesting to see that Glasgow has topped the tanning charts in this research.

‘Fake tan is one of our hero sellers as a beauty retailer and it’s interesting to look at the regional differences.

'In some places customers will buy one bottle to last the whole summer, while for others it’s a weekly purchase.’
