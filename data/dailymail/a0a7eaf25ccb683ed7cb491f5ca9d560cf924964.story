Graham Taylor, 66, stole money from his mother and an an engineering firm where he worked as finance director to fund his online gambling.

To his colleagues, Graham Taylor was a trusted member of staff who appeared to be working hard to help keep their engineering firm going.

But unbeknown to them, the greedy finance director was responsible for bringing the company to the brink after stealing a ‘breathtaking’ £1.5million to fund his addiction to online gambling.

While other staff were made redundant or had their hours reduced – and his fellow directors invested their own savings or worked for free – Taylor gave himself a secret pay rise and gambled thousands of pounds in company cash on internet bingo sites.

Only when it emerged that the firm, which was days from receivership, owed £250,000 to the taxman were the 66-year-old’s accounts investigated and the theft discovered.

On Thursday work colleagues applauded from the public gallery at Bolton Crown Court as Taylor was jailed  for five years after admitting four charges of theft and two of fraud.

Recorder Timothy Stead told him: ‘It is to your shame and discredit that you not only breached the trust of your employers but did so repeatedly.

The amount you took can only be described as breathtaking.

‘The money, in very large part, appears to have gone on gambling to which, it’s apparent, you were addicted.’ 

The court heard how Taylor, who was also secretary  of a local social club, joined  Rochdale-based Nema Ltd in June 1999 as a book-keeper but was promoted to financial director and given shares worth 4 per cent of the company.

Mark Monaghan, prosecuting, said the firm enjoyed a period of growth, turning over £3million a year before 2007 when Taylor’s stealing began.

‘It is clear the defendant started to steal from the company to a significant extent,’ Mr Monaghan said. ‘As a  result . . . Nema’s financial position deteriorated significantly.’

Nema Engineering on Lomax Street, Rochdale, where Graham Taylor worked before he was jailed at Bolton Crown Court.

By the end of 2009 Nema, which 
employed 35 workers, had to introduce drastic savings. Taylor suggested 
staff should be made redundant and three were laid off.

Others had hours
and wages reduced.

At the same time Taylor gave himself a
£72,000 pay rise.

It was only when a firm of accountants was brought in
that he confessed to theft.

Between 2007 and 2010 he had taken a 
total of £1,533,636. Although he recouped £800,000 through his winnings 
and the sale of his house, more than £900,000 had been lost.

The court heard Taylor, who lived in 
Castleton, near Rochdale, with his wife of 42 years, Jean, 66, also 
stole £17,000 from his late mother, who had made him executor of her 
will.

Andrew McInnes, defending, said his client had ‘no idea’ how much he was spending.

‘Mr Taylor has genuine regret that 
he’s put his colleagues  in this position [but] no mitigation will help 
these people who fretted for their livelihood,’ he added.
