Trying out his metal detector he'd been given for Christmas, Gary Underwood discovered a World War Two shell – which helped him prove an old family story.

He found the device buried in a bank at the foot of his Kent garden. Mr Underwood was testing a story told by his grandfather Bill, who said he had uncovered it in the garden while digging in 1973 – but then threw it into the mud bank.

'The story has always fascinated me so I thought I'd have a quick go with the detector,' said Mr Underwood, 27, who lives in Sittingbourne with his parents.

'The next thing 'beep, beep, beep'. I dug down about three inches and found it.' 

Gary assumed the bomb had been discarded but thought he would test out his new equipment just in case.

And he was stunned when his metal detector began to beep and he found the battered shell under a three inch layer of mud.

Gary, who lives with his parents, said: 'My grandad told me how he was digging his garden over with a fork in about 1973 when he found the shell.

'He picked it up and looked at it and threw it up the bank at the bottom of the garden. 

Mr Underwood found the shell, right, using a metal detector he had been given as a Christmas gift 

'I picked it up and put it down on the garden bench before telling my mum and dad what I'd found. They thought I was joking to start with.

'It was then we said perhaps we should let someone know so I called 101 but was told to dial 999. I started to worry a bit then.'

Three police officers were sent to the scene. On arrival they took a picture of the device before sending it to the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team.

Gary added: 'They told us to go inside, not to touch it and wait for further information.

'They then sent another message saying they may have to evacuate my street and Gaze Hill, which is behind it. At that point I was thinking 'I'm not going to be very popular'.

After calling the police, officers alerted ordnance experts who took the shell away to dispose of it

'Forty minutes later they turned up in a big green lorry so all the curtains were twitching.

'They came in had a quick look at it and took it away to dispose of it, which was a relief.

'I was a bit gutted because grandad found it and had told me about it since I was a kid, but I understand why they took it.'

Gary was bought the metal detector by mum Sharon, 54, dad Alan, 53 and his partner Sophie, 27.

Police alerted ordnance experts who took the shell away to dispose of it.
