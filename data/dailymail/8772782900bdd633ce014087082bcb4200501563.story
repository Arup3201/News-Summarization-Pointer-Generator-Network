A Belgian photographer proposed to his girlfriend at the top of an African volcano after the red-hot lava lake fired up his courage.

Temperatures soared at the end of a day-long trek up 3,470 metre high Mount Nyiragongo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 

Guy Dekelver, 37, proposed to Sietske van Poelgeest, 35, as they enjoyed the spectacular views - and she said 'yes'.

Photographer Guy Dekelver proposed to his girlfriend Sietske van Poelgeest at the top of the 3,470 metre high volcano

Burning passion: Mount Nyiragongo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has a 2km wide crater filled with a lake of lava

Guy Dekelve said he couldn't help but be motivated by the spectacular sight of the volcano

Volcanoes at Nyiragongo caused by the rifting of the Earth's crust where two parts of the African Plate are breaking apart

The dramatic pictures show smoke billowing from the 2km wide crater as the red and black lava bubbles away inside the lake.

Guy, who was born in Belgium but working in Rwanda, said: 'Sietske came to visit me for a week and I had to choose whether to take her to the volcano or to see gorillas.

'She is a geographer, so it was not a difficult decision. After all, when you get a chance to see such a spectacle, you have to go for it.

'We arrived in the afternoon and stayed over night.

'The first time you catch a glimpse of the lava lake your jaws just drop.

'Nothing prepares you for the spectacle you'll be treated with at night. It was intense.

'After retiring to our tents in the evening, I proposed.

'Well, it seems I didn't actually ask but said "I want to marry you".

'We were both very tired, yet I felt Sietske's reaction was relatively cool, as in "I would also want to marry you".

The lava lake is mostly confined within a broad, steep-sided cinder cone on the crater floor, measuring roughly 60 feet high by 600 feet wide

Nyiragongo is one of a few volcanoes in the area that are responsible for 40% of Africa's volcano eruptions

Steaming: The couple were overcome by the dramatic smoke billowing from the burning lava

'Only the next day did it trickle down that it was actually a full on proposal, so that time I did it right and actually asked the question: "Do you want to marry me?"

'That was welcomed with a full on "yes".'

He added: 'We started our descent that morning, when we had clear skies and I was able to take these photographs.

'We felt privileged to experience such an amazing place and to witness the sight that unfolded in front of us. It was well worth the climb.

'It's a wonderful experience to see the earth at it's rawest.

'The forces you see there show you how beautiful and powerful nature is and how tiny we are.'

The lava lake is mostly confined within a broad, steep-sided cinder cone on the crater floor, measuring roughly 60 feet high by 600 feet wide.

Volcanism at Nyiragongo is caused by the rifting of the Earth's crust where two parts of the African Plate are breaking apart.

The most recent eruption of the volcano began on January 17, 2002. A 13 km fissure opened in the south flank of the volcano, spreading in a few hours from 2,800m to 1,550m elevation.
