Liverpool's Champions League hopes remain alive but a late Ludogorets equaliser saw them leave Bulgaria disappointed.

They did, however, show resilience to recover from goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's third-minute blunder as Rickie Lambert scored his second in as many games before Jordan Henderson scored the vital second just before half-time, only for Georgi Terziev to nick an equaliser to secure a 2-2 draw at the death.

Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell rates the players' performances on Wednesday.

LIVERPOOL (4-4-2)

Simon Mignolet – 3

Horrible error for the opening goal hardly mitigated by bouncy pitch. Awful on crosses

Javier Manquillo – 5

One shot at goal following overlapping run but needed to be told to get back

Martin Skrtl – 5.5

Troubled by Ludogorets movement early on but won important headers and improved

Striker Rickie Lambert scores Liverpool's first goal against Ludogorets

Kolo Toure – 4.5

Poor clearance for the first goal and looked uncertain throughout in the air

Glen Johnson – 5.5

Better defensively at left-back but lost his man at corner for late equaliser

Lucas – 6

Rusty on first game in three weeks and gave away fouls. But grew into game and source of probing long passes

Simon Mignolet's gaffe gifted the opening goal to Dani Abalo of Ludogerets

Joe Allen – 5.5

Few moments of note and struggled to impose himself in midfield until a late couple of clearing headers

Jordan Henderson – 7

Great run, pointing Sterling to where he was headed, and finish to edge Liverpool ahead

Steven Gerrard – 6.5

Performed better in advanced role, where his sharp passing had more impact

Raheem Sterling produced another impressive display for Liverpool

Raheem Sterling – 7

Terrific energy, always wanting to win back ball, and superb cross for Henderson goal but costly miss in second half

Rickie Lambert – 7.5

Generated own power for well-placed header. Reward for pressing. Good pass in build-up to second too 

Sub

Alberto Moreno (for Sterling 82’) - 6

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers was left to rue a late slip in Bulgaria

Manager 

Brendan Rodgers - 6 

Nearly got the win that was required but punished for failing to use substitutes to affect. 

Referee

Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz (Spain) - 6 

Fell for some Ludogorets play-acting too easily and rather fussy

Ludogorets (4-2-3-1)

Stoyanov 5; Caicara 6.5, Moti 4, Terziev 6, Minev 5.5; Dyakov 6.5, Espinho 7 (Younes 81' 5); Alexandrov 6 (Wanderson 72' 5.5), Marcelinho 6.5, Misidjan 6.5; Abalo 7 (Azevedo Junior 69' 5)
