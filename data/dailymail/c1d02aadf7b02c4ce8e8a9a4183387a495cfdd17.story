Prince Charles has today spoken of his sorrow at the 'brutal' execution of Drummer Lee Rigby and admitted it has affected the morale of the armed forces.

The future king said the Woolwich killing of the Fusilier on May 22 has taken its 'toll' on troops, but proved their ability to overcome adversity.

Lee Rigby, 25, a father-of-one and the 2nd Battalion Royal 
Regiment of Fusiliers, was run down by a car and then hacked to death as he returned to his barracks.

Upsetting: The Prince of Wales has today spoken of how the 'brutal' death of Fusilier Lee Rigby, who was hacked to death in the street in Woolwich in May, has taken its toll on troops' morale

The Prince of Wales said he was shocked by the act, and said he understood the worry of families whose loved-ones are in the forces, as his son Harry has actively served around the world.

He made the comments to mark the launch of The Sun newspaper's annual Military Awards.

'The challenges our Armed Forces face are not confined to physical and psychological injuries sustained on the battlefield,' he said writing in the newspaper.

Understanding: Prince Charles said he knew the anxiety felt by families well, as his son Harry has also served abroad, pictured at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan last year

'The effect on morale of long and enduring campaigns that separate troops from their loved ones again and again, of redundancy programmes that are reshaping our Armed Forces and even the threat to our off-duty troops in the perceived sanctity of their homeland - as seen with the brutal death of Fusilier Rigby - all take their toll.

'Over the last few years, every soldier, sailor, airman and woman has demonstrated beyond all doubt they can stand firm against any adversity.'

Drummer Rigby's horrific killing led to nationwide shock and revulsion and led to an outpouring of support for his family from the public.

The Prince said he is 'convinced' that the public all have a role to play in helping 'those who have suffered as a result of their service', ranging from donations and fundraising through to visual support such as t-shirts and car stickers.

Talking about the risks that every armed force member face, he said: 'I know very well how much worry this danger creates for families and loved one, as my own son Harry served in Afghanistan over the winter.'

Charles, who himself served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, added that the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan will continue to be a 'very tricky operation' and that troops remain 'exposed to every conceivable danger'.

In court: Royal Barnes, from Hackney, is accused of creating clips about the father-of-one's death, whose funeral was held in Bury, Lancashire, in July

A 22-year-old man from East London has been charged with terror offences after allegedly making a series of video recordings about the murder of soldier Lee Rigby.

Royal Barnes, from Hackney, is accused of creating clips about the father-of-one's death, publishing a statement entitled 'Muslim laughs at British Soldier killing', and inciting terrorism overseas.

He is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court after being arrested on Friday along with a 21-year-old woman, who is due to answer bail on Tuesday.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said Barnes is charged with dissemination of terrorist publications for allegedly making a series of recordings about Fusilier Rigby's death on May 22, and circulating them "with the intention, either directly or indirectly of encouraging others into the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism".

He is also charged with encouraging an act of terrorism by publishing a statement that glorified the killing, and inciting terrorism overseas.

It is claimed that on June 12 he 'incited another to commit an act of terrorism, wholly or partly outside the United Kingdom, and that act, would if committed in England and Wales constitute an offence'.
