A series of online ads  released this week by a Republican organization for college students are being called 'sexist' by some women for the way they believe the commercials talk down to young, female voters.

The minute-long ads, created by the College Republican National Committee, spoof the TLC show Say Yes to the Dress and feature a recent college grad shopping for a wedding dress with her mother and friends. 

For anyone who's ever seen the popular reality TV program on which the ads are based, the CNRC Say Yes to the Candidate videos are a spot-on parody of the drama that typically plays out in each episode of the show.

The College Republican National Committee is getting flak from some women over the way it recently spoofed the TLC show Say Yes to the Dress as part of an election-year ad campaign

The online ads, which are running in 16 states, feature a recent college grad shopping for a wedding dress with her mother and friends. Each dress is named after a candidate in November's elections. The prettier dress, shown above, is always a Republican candidate

A mother and daughter bicker over which dress is the 'one' as the bride's mother insists 'I know best,' the bride-to-be's tag alongs take the side of their friend, and in the end, the woman walking down the aisle settles on the dress she wanted all along.

The wedding dresses in the ads serve as metaphors for various political candidates in November's elections, and locally targeted versions of the campaign spots are running online in 16 states.

The more attractive wedding dress in the ad is favored by an undecided voter and young bride identified as Brittany. The uglier, more expensive dress, which comes with 'additional costs, including '$2 billion in taxes, $3.6 billion in debt and 15 percent tuition increases' is her mom's first choice.

Notably, the simple dress in the spoofs represents Republican candidates, and the frumpy dress always shares a name with a Democratic candidate.

While conservatives and Republicans are lauding the ads as quirky and refreshing, the CRNC has taken flak for the million-dollar ad campaign from women who perceive the commercials as demeaning to female voters.

Time magazine's Charlotte Alter called the campaign the 'Most Sexist Republican Ad of the Year' and blasted the CRNC for belittling women.

'Because women don’t like dirty old politics, women like wedding dresses!' she sarcastically wrote.

Alter also took issue with the way the ad boils down financial issues to 'an ugly veil, ugly sash, and ugly necklace. Because veils are easier to understand than debt, obviously,' she opined.

A writer for the New Republic, a left-leaning publication, also labeled the ads as 'offensive' in a piece and 'condescending' in her headline. Elle's Sally Holmes trashed them as a 'half-a**ed attempt at brainwashing' and claimed that the videos make 'NO SENSE. None, zero, zilch.'

The Democratic Governor's Association piled on, saying in a statement that the ads are 'further evidence' that Republicans 'still have no idea how to communicate with women voters.'

'That’s because it’s not just their attitudes that are condescending and insulting, but because their policies – from deep cuts to education to opposition to equal pay for equal work, to mandatory ultrasounds and defunding Planned Parenthood – are deeply out-of-touch with the concerns of women and families,' spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said. 

The frumpy dress, featured here, is always a Democrat running in that state's election

CNRC Chair, Alex Smith, the first woman to be elected to the organization's top spot, defended the campaign in the Wall Street Journal as an attempt by her majority-female staff to speak to young women in a 'culturally relevant way.'

Smith was backed up by a spokeswoman for Young America's Foundation, another conservative organization for college students, on Twitter.

'So clever. Nice work. Way to reach young females in a creative way,' YAF's Ashley Pratte tweeted.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus also thew his support behind Smith and the CRNC. 

'I think it's a pretty clever ad,' he said, according to the Washington Examiner's Betsy Woodruff.

Making fun of the attention being heaped on the controversial set of ads, Susan J. Demas, a columnist for MLive.com, a website that focuses on news related to Michigan, joked that she was bothered by the way her state's male governor, Rick Snyder, a Republican, was objectified in the Michigan-based version of the ad and treated with 'disrespect.'

'Yes, she's actually comparing the governor of Michigan to a shiny piece of fabric. I was flabbergasted,' Demas stated. 'How can they get away with such patronizing tripe?'

Demas went on to say Snyder 'is more than just a pretty face' and points out that he earned three degrees in six years from the University of Michigan.
