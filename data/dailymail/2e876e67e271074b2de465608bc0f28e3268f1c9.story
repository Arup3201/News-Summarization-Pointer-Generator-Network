Ahead of Chelsea's trip to Manchester City on Sunday afternoon Sportsmail's  Rob Draper gives his thoughts on the big game at the Etihad Stadium.

Frank’s Etihad blues 

The last time City’s ex-Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard won a match at The Etihad Stadium, Robinho was making his debut for the home side. Lampard scored in a 3-1 Chelsea win in September 2008 but was an unused substitute when Chelsea twice played there last season. 

Now, he’s a City player, albeit temporarily, and if he plays on Sunday it will be his home debut for the club.

Diego the difference

Diego Costa has already scored seven Premier League goals, Fernando Torres managed only five in the whole of last season. Chelsea are going goal crazy in general at the moment. They have scored 15 in their four League games — last season the tally was four.

City’s fair Sheik?  

Roman Abramovich supports the rules on financial fairplay, Sheik Mansour doesn’t. City manager Manuel Pellegrini is sympathetic to his boss, who has been ordered to rein in spending even though the club have no debts. ‘I understand if you have a big unpaid debt, you should be punished. But this is a club that doesn’t have a debt of one pound to anyone,’ said Pellegrini.

Compatriot games

Some World Cup colleagues will be sworn enemies. City’s Belgium captain Vincent Kompany will be out to stop compatriot Eden Hazard. Chelsea’s Oscar and City’s Fernandinho shared the shame of losing 7-1 to Germany with Brazil.

England misses out

How many Englishmen will start the biggest match of the Premier League season so far? Probably only three — Joe Hart (Man City), John Terry and Gary Cahill (both Chelsea). Though City duo James Milner and Lampard will hope to see action at some point.
