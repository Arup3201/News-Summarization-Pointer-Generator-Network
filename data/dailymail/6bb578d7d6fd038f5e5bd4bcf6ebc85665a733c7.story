Two Canadian friends have invented an entirely new way to brush your teeth - using your tongue.

Adel Elseri and Said Fayad, both 26, say their invention is far more hygienic than a conventional toothbrush.

The disposable gadget, called T2T, which stands for Tongue To Teeth, slips over the tongue, and has a coating of toothpaste.

'You donâ€™t use your hands, hygiene is key,' Elseri told the Montreal Gazette.

Elseri, a 26-year-old boilermaker said he was driving home from a 12-hour shift working in Fort McMurray when he came up with the idea, he said.

The pair have already set up a Facebook page and Twitter account for their invention, and are currently auditioning for the Canadian version of Dragons Den, where they hope to raise $100,000 Canadian dollars to begin production.

They boast 'We are the world's first tongue mounted teeth cleaning product.'

The hands-free toothbrush is coated with toothpaste and is designed to be used once then thrown away

The pair have already created prototypes, and hope it could go on sale this year - if they win investment on the Canadian version of Dragons Den
