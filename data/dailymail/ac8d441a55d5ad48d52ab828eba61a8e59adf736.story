A carer is facing jail after being convicted of abusing three young brothers by battering them with bamboo sticks and forcing the youngest to brush his teeth with dog mess.

Stephanie Chibnall, 45, cared for the boys - now aged nine, ten and 13 - after their mother had a breakdown in 2008.

A court heard she regularly beat them with her fists, sticks and an electric fly swatter - leaving them covered in severe cuts and bruises.

The boys would be punished for trivial reasons - including not having any homework and because they could not find Chibnall’s cigarettes.

Blood was found on their school books but Chibnall covered up her beatings by lying to teachers that the injuries were just from 'boys being boys'.

On one occasion, she hit one of the boys with a bamboo stick so hard that it broke - then got another implement to finish her punishment.

The court heard she once discovered a tooth brush was dirty and made one of the boys cover it in dog poo and use it to clean his teeth.

During another episode, one of the boys was so badly injured his teachers thought he had been in a car crash.

The offences, which left one of the brothers with a scar half an inch long on his forehead, took place between 2008 and March 2011.

The court heard her abuse eventually came to light after staff at the boys’ school grew concerned by the bruising on their bodies.

Chibnall, from Gravesend, Kent, denied three charges of cruelty to a person under 16 but was convicted on Tuesday following a trial at Maidstone Crown Court.

Adjourning sentence until the end of October and granting bail, Judge David Griffith-Jones QC warned Chibnall she was likely to face a jail sentence.

Anthony Prosser, prosecuting, told how on one occasion, Chibnall phoned one of the boys’ schools asking for him to be excused from a Christmas play because he had fallen over and the bruising was causing him too much pain.

Mr Prosser told the court: 'Staff were aware he had fallen over the day before, which had been reported and logged.

'They spoke to him afterwards. They said he had large bruises on his left upper leg from hip to knee, looking as if he had been in a car crash.

'He said he had fallen over in the playground. Staff reported their concerns.'

Mr Prosser added that the boys claimed they were beaten with sticks, slapped and punched to the head while living with Chibnall.

He continued: 'On one occasion, she made the youngest brush his teeth with a toothbrush smeared with dog excrement.'

Mr Prosser said specialist police officers spoke to the boys individually and one claimed Chibnall hit them with sticks - including one that had a small bit of metal on the end.

The prosecutor said: 'He [the boy] said she demanded to know why he didn’t always have homework.

'She picked up a stick she used to threaten dogs with and hit him on the leg and arm.

'He cried because it hurt. She told him he was being a baby.'

Another time she asked him why his 
room was messy and struck him, causing the boy to hit his head on the 
window sill. He was left with a scar about half an inch long.

Mr Prosser added: 'He went to A&E and the cut was glued. She told him to tell the nurses he had fallen off his skateboard.

'He spoke of another occasion when she had been angry because a toothbrush was dirty and had hairs on it. He didn’t answer and suspicion fell on him.

'She made him go out into the garden and smear dog poo on it. He didn’t tell anyone because they dared not say anything.'

Another told how he was punched in the mouth when he said he did not have any spellings for homework.

He had a couple of days off school and told teachers he had been hit by a swing. He said she told him not to tell anyone or she would hit him again.

Chibnall denied ever assaulting the youngsters but said she had made them stand in the corner with their hands on their heads to discipline them.

She claimed the stick was to control her dogs and she did not hit the children with it. She claimed to know nothing about a toothbrush incident.

Under sentencing guidelines Chibnall faces up to nine years in prison for her three year reign of terror on the brothers.
