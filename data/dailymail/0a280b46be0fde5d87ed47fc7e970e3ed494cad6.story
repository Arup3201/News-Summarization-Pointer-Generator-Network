Michael Douglas cut a forlorn figure as he stepped out alone while in France on Tuesday night following the breakdown of his 13-year marriage to Catherine Zeta Jones.

The 68-year-old actor was pictured looking downcast as he arrived at La Petite Maison restaurant in Nice, but did his best to put on a brave face as he greeted friends inside. 

The pair, who have two children together, confirmed on Wednesday that they have separated to 'evaluate and work on their marriage.'

They released a statement via their publicist after reports their marriage had hit the rocks.

'Catherine and Michael are taking some time apart to evaluate and work on their marriage. There will be no further comment,' a representative told MailOnline on behalf of the pair.

Their marriage has been dealt numerous stresses in the last three years with Michael being diagnosed with throat cancer in 2010 - which he beat - and Catherine, 43, suffering from bouts of bipolar II disorder, most recently in May this year.

The Hollywood power couple are currently thousands of miles apart, with Michael holidaying in Europe while Catherine remains in New York.

Time apart: Michael Douglas and his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones, last pictured together here on 22 April, have 
reportedly separated as they struggle to maintain their marriage

Neither are making moves towards a divorce or legal separation at this stage, according to this week's People magazine.

The couple, who married in 2000, haven't been seen publicly together since 22 April, when they cuddled up on the red carpet at the 40th Annual Chaplin Award Gala at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City.

They are said to have decided to spend some time alone after Michael returned from this year's Cannes Film Festival in France in May.

While in Italy last week, Michael was seen playing golf on his own - a hobby he once enjoyed with second wife Catherine. 

Michael is said to be living in 
Manhattan while Catherine is staying at their $4m home in New York State
with their children Dylan, 13, and Carys, ten.

Rumours about the couple's marriage trouble have been circulating for months.

In February it was claimed by The 
Enquirer that the pair were to separate in a 'hush hush' divorce. (They 
denied the claims at the time.)

The
Enquirer alleged that the marriage 'buckled under the pressure of 
dealing with Michael's cancer battle, his son Cameron's incarceration on
drugs charges and Catherine's struggle with bipolar II disorder.' 

More recently, Star 
Magazine reported that Catherine was set to begin a '$300m divorce battle' 
against Michael.

Were you surprised to hear of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' split?

Sources told People magazine this week that the strain of the past few years took its toll on the couple.

'It's been very stressful,' said a family friend. 'He loved Catherine, but she has her own issues.'

And Catherine was apparently distraught during her husband's cancer battle, telling the Daily Telegraph that she hadn't 'had to deal with anything like that before, ever. I wasn't as strong as I thought I could have been.'

But in an interview last month with the 
Daily Mirror, Michael hinted that the couple's struggles had only served
to strengthen their bond.

'True love takes work. Love is an extraordinary feeling that comes from 
the bottom of your soul, but has to be nurtured, you know. The thing 
I've learned about getting older is you can't take love for granted,' he
said.

'You protect it, nurture it and it grows and after one's initial, 
physical, emotional aspects, it becomes deeper,' added Michael.

On Friday, Michael is expected to attend the Deauville Film Festival in France; poignantly, it is where he first met Catherine in 1998 and famously introduced himself by saying: 'I want to father your children.'

Michael, the son of screen veteran Kirk Douglas, was attracted to Catherine after seeing her in the 1998 film The Mask Of Zorro.

'It was like when I saw Julie Christie. Wow,' he told People in 2009. 'We romanced each other slowly - controlled by Catherine.'

And the feeling was mutual, said Catherine.

'I fell in love with Michael the 
moment I met him and our relationship has just grown stronger and 
stronger,' Catherine told the UK edition of OK! magazine in 2010.

'We 
are very close. I know there were some cynics when we first got together
but we married because of love and that has never waned, not for a 
minute,' she added.

They were to 
marry two years later in a lavish ceremony at the Plaza Hotel in 
Manhattan, which was attended by the likes of Jack Nicholson and Martha 
Stewart.

Catherine was 
first treated for bipolar II disorder in 2011. And in 
April, she underwent another stint in rehab in her continued effort to 
manage the illness.

Michael, meanwhile, revealed he was suffering from stage IV throat cancer in August 2010.

He underwent treatment and in January the following year publicly declared the tumour had gone.

At the time, he attributed the illness to stress, his previous alcohol abuse and years of heavy smoking.

But in June this year he made comments saying the HPV virus - which is contracted through oral sex - could have been the cause of his cancer.

Douglas backtracked on his remarks, but 
Catherine was humiliated because he didn't clarify he was exposed to the
virus before meeting her, according to People magazine.

Bad move: Michael said in June that the HPV virus could have been the cause of his cancer, a comment that apparently 'humiliated' Catherine, pictured on the Graham Norton Show in May 

Michael recently spoke about his divorce from first wife Diandra, a 23-year marriage he admits he should have ended earlier.

He said: 'I know I’m going to get into trouble here. I have nothing against her and in fact I’m very fond of my first wife. But we should have ended that marriage eight or 10 years earlier.

'It took me too long to realise that if you go to a marriage counselor to resolve problems, it’s in his interest to keep the marriage going. Because if I end the marriage he’s got no business.'

Diandra won a reported $45 million in the divorce settlement, and in 2011, she unsuccessfully tried to sue Michael for half of his earnings from the movie Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. 

Hung on too long: Michael  admitted in a recent interview that he and ex-wife Diandra Luker should have divorced far sooner than what they did, in 2000, pictured together in NYC in 1990
