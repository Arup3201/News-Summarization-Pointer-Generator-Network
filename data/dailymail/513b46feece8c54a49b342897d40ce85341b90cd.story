On December 29th of last year in the small mining town of Evanston, Wyoming, a 13-year-old boy and his 10-year-old sister walking under a railway bridge came upon the half-frozen body of man carrying only his ID, a piece of paper with a Californian phone number and a check for $54,000.

The mystery only deepened when it was discovered that the hypothermia victim was 60-year-old Timothy Henry Gray, a long-lost relative of the reclusive and eccentric New York heiress Huguette Clark who stood to inherit a share of $34.5 million from her $300 million fortune.

Disappearing from his basic rented accommodation nine months before, Gray managed to avoid the many private investigators who came looking for him as relatives of Clark scrambled in courts to get their share of her money.

Evanston, Wyoming, U.S. - Kaiden, 13 and his sister Amber, 10, look towards the overpass where they found Timothy Gray the morning of December 29th. When the man didn't respond, they ran home to tell their mom they'd found a dead man

But why did a man who stood to inherit so much go out of his way to avoid it? And what do those who briefly knew him say that says about his opinions on the battle for Huguette Clark's millions?

The search for these answers began with New York photographer, Elijah Solomon.

Intrigued as to how such an apparent man of means and fortune could fall through the cracks of society and die cold and alone, Solomon set off to rural Evanston to discover as much of the truth as he could.

All he had to start was the knowledge that the telephone number in his pocket belonged to his brother who had not heard from him since their mother's funeral 20 years before.

Discovering Evanston, population 12,359, to be a stop for transients and truckers, Solomon's search for the elusive life of Gray led him to the small apartment complex known as 'The Classic Lodge'.

It was here that Solomon found Gray had no friends, only neighbors, some of whom lived next door to him for a decade, but frustratingly knew almost nothing about his life, let alone the fact he was heir to a multi-million fortune.

Paranoid: Rick Sathers had sporadic interactions with Gray and described him as paranoid, often whispering in conversations, 'He was kinda spooky, and he'd come in at odd hours, but he'd never do anything to hurt anyone.

Speaking to George Riker, the owner of 'The Classic Lodge', Solomon discovered that the mining and copper heir had in fact left his apartment nine months before his death to live his life as a homeless hermit.

'Tim lived here since 2002, before he went off on his Howard Hughes phase,' said Riker.

'He only ever talked to me and my son. Never did I see him talk to anyone else. He was a complete loner. But sometimes we'd shoot the breeze or talk mechanics.'

Gaining access into Gray's still relatively well-preserved apartment, Solomon found that Gray had been hoarding scrap metal and had seemingly become obsessed with building or designing experimental aircraft - just like Howard Hughes.

Hoarder:  Inside Gray's old apartment in the Classic Lodge, where
he had been hoarding copper and aluminum scrap metal.  'Ryan and I 
spent days cleaning it out'', said George. 'It was piled up to the 
ceiling. We hauled off two truckloads.  Lucky it didn't collapse the 
damn floor.'

As he looked at the addresses on unopened letters, the photographer found that Gray had been renting an office in town for the past ten years too.

The 40-page settlement that was accepted in Manhattan's Surrogate's Court  in September combines elements from Huguette Clark's two wills from 2005 and includes:$34.5 million for Clark's relatives - many of whom had never met the heiress

$11.5 million for the relatives' legal fees

$85 million home in Santa Barbara, California and Clark's art collection to be controlled by an arts foundation, the Bellosguardo Foundation, which was set up by the will

$4.5 million cash for the art foundation

$1.7 million doll collection for the art foundation

$3.5 million for Clark's goddaughter, Wanda Styka, who wrote to her throughout her life

$10 million for the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.

$1 million for the Beth Israel Medical Center, where Clark lived for 20 years

$0 for Hadassah Peri, the private nurse who had originally been in line for $30 million. She must also pay back $5 million in gifts

$0 for Clark's attorney, Wallace Bock, and her accountant, Irving Kamsler, who had been in line for $500,000

Rick Sathers the owner, also told a similar tale of a loner, with no friends, who while not threatening was certainly eccentric, to say the least.

'He was fastidious. Never missed a payment. I think he mostly used it as a place to have mail sent, but for a time he was doing work,' said Sathers.

'Something with computers and voice recognition, and I remember when he found out someone else had already done it, he was upset, because his plan was to be first in that.'

Rick described him to Solomon as 
paranoid, often whispering in conversations, 'He was kinda spooky, and 
he'd come in at odd hours, but he'd never do anything to hurt 
anyone...There used to be AA meetings in the basement here.

'I think that's why he wanted this office. I also know he sponsored some kids in Africa, maybe Sudan.'

It is still unknown where and how Gray accessed or indeed got his money from.

No
bank accounts have been found and the source of the $54,000 check to 
cash found in his pocket has never been properly accounted for.

George
Riker believed that his obsession with collecting scrap metal holds the
deepest fascination for him now he knows who his reclusive tenant 
really was.

Gray was 
the great-grandson of former U.S. Senator William Andrews Clark, who 
made his reputation as one of the copper kings of Montana, who also 
diversified into banking, building, railroads and reserves special fame 
as the founder of Las Vegas.

Since
the death of Hugette Clark in 2011 and left all her money to doctors 
and nurses, the remnants of her family have been fighting in the courts 
to claim what they believe to be their fair share.

In
her will, Huguette Clak bequeathed no money at all to her family, 
leaving it all instead to her nurse, goddaughter, attorney, accountant, 
hospital, doctor, favourite museum and various employees and an art 
foundation she wanted established at her oceanfront estate in Santa 
Barbara, California.

It
is thought that not one of her relatives had seen her in 40 years, 
although some had tried to keep contact with her through holiday cards 
and the occasional phone calls.

Because they did not receive a penny 
in her will, 19 of Clark's relatives stepped forward to challenge her 
will in a New York court.

A
public administrator joined in on behalf of Gray who lawyers had tried 
to contact about the battle, but all they could find were belongings 
abandoned in a storage locker - private investigators were not able to 
find him.

Indeed, even 
if investigators could not contact Gray and he had been granted a share 
of the massive inheritance, his spouse or children would have been 
entitled to it - however he had no wife or kids.

A homeless Vietnam vet in Evanston who encountered Timothy several times but asked not to be named. In between quotes from Hunter S. Thompson, he described meeting Timothy in the fall under the same bridge where he was later found dead. 'Tim was already there, and he wasn't very welcoming, so I went elsewhere.'

In September of this year, members of the family eventually won $34.5 million after the lengthy legal battle concluded.

'I got the impression Tim resented the family…thought they'd squandered the money. I think he was ashamed.', says Riker.

What is known is Gray left 'The Classic Lodge' to live under the railway overpass where he eventually was found dead by Kaiden, 13 and his sister Amber, 10.

A Vietnam veteran who also calls the bridge home told Solomon that he ran into Gray a couple of times over the last few months of his life.

'I never saw him rise from his bedroll; I wasn't sure he could even stand up. 

'I tried once to bring him some clothes, and it was like 'he wanted them but didn't want them'…On Thanksgiving I tried to get him to come get a hot meal in town, but he wouldn't budge.

'I eventually asked if he intended to stay under that bridge all winter, and he said to me, 'that wouldn't be practical.'

Last year, Gray's older brother, Jerry, said that Tim had worked as a cowboy and lived in the Rocky Mountain states most of his life.

'He was homeless essentially,' said Jerry to NBC News.

'If we had proper mental health services in this country, we could have notified and known to do something.'

That rang true with Riker who said that 'Tim had equestrian knowledge, which was funny because my wife at the time worked on horses. He knew Shania Twain had Tennessee Walkers.  He knew Patrick Swayze had Arabian Horses.'

Intriguingly, Solomon found a strong independent streak ran through everything he discovered Gray had done in Evanston.

People who spoke to him around town described a man who admired the book 'Into the Wild' about  Christopher McCandless and his adventure's in Alaska.

Ultimately, Solomon found Gray to be just as enigmatic as his relative Huguette Clark.
