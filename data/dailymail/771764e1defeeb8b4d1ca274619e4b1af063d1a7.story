Manuel Pellegrini insists that he is not feeling the heat asManchester City attempt to keep their Champions League hopes alive against Bayern Munich on Tuesday night.

Pellegrini was hired to take City forward in Europe but after leading the club to the last 16 in his first season in England the Chilean faces an embarrassing exit at the group stage after picking up two points from his first four games.

Defeat at the hands of group winners Bayern at the Etihad would effectively end City’s interest in this season’s competition and cast further doubts over Pellegrini’s future, but the manager said: ‘I don’t feel under extra pressure.

‘I think it is important for this club to continue in Europe because it is one of our targets to improve every year. Tomorrow we will see the team fighting until the end to continue in the Champions League and I hope we can do it.

‘I don’t know who are those people who don’t believe what we can do. This team and me especially have a lot of trust we can do it and I am sure we can continue having a chance to the last game.

‘Nobody in the whole team is happy the way we have played in this group. We have tomorrow, our last chance to win this year against Bayern Munich.’

The Premier League champions will have a clearer indication of where they stand before kick-off because CSKA entertain Roma earlier in the day.

But the task facing City is even tougher without Yaya Toure and Fernandinho, who are both suspended after being sent off in the defeat to CSKA, while David Silva, Edin Dzeko and Aleksandar Kolarov are injured.

Neither Sergio Aguero or Stevan Jovetic trained on Monday morning but Pellegrini said that both players would be in the squad.

City were beaten 3-1 at home by Bayern last season but won 3-2 in the Allianz Arena after the Germans had already qualified which bodes well for Tuesday’s encounter, especially if Pep Guardiola puts out a weakened side.

However, Pellegrini disagreed that it would benefit his team. 

‘I don’t think so because they have injuries but we also have important players out – Fernandinho, Yaya, Dzeko, Silva, Kolarov,’ he added.

‘I think big teams have a squad and I don’t think Bayern will play in a worse way than they are doing so far.

‘I think it is very difficult to compare one season with another one. Last season they played here very well and won 3-1. After that we went to Munich and won. The three games we have played against Bayern have been very close. We will see tomorrow which team plays better.

‘We were very unlucky to lose against Bayern in the last minute on a set-piece (in September). After that we conceded a late goal in Moscow against CSKA. Maybe with those points our situation would be different but tomorrow we must play well and try to score.’
