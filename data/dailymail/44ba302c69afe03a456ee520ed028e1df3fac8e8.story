The FA's racism investigation into Malky Mackay and Iain Moody has escalated after it emerged a former Cardiff City official submitted a written complaint to the governing body claiming he was a victim of discrimination.

Alisher Apsalyamov is from Kazakhstan and was horrified to discover he allegedly became known to Mackay and Moody as 'Chemical Ali' during his time at the club.

Mackay, now in charge of Wigan Athletic after his controversial appointment last month, and former Cardiff head of recruitment Moody are still awaiting the outcome of the FA inquiry into an exchange of racist, homophobic and sexist messages first revealed by Sportsmail.

But the FA have taken more than three months to reach a conclusion partly because of the efforts they have made to secure evidence from potential victims and witnesses. While FA lawyers wrestle with the issue of private and public communication, an attempt has apparently been made to establish if a culture of discrimination existed when Mackay and Moody were in power at the club.

This is understood to have included asking players, among them former Cardiff midfielder Ibrahim Farah, to give evidence. Farah, who is Welsh of Somali heritage, claimed in a tweet that Mackay would refer to him as the ‘wee Egyptian’, only to then delete the allegation.

Sportsmail understands that in the email and text exchanges between Mackay and Moody seized by Cardiff investigators at Moody’s home, Apsalyamov was referred to as ‘Chemical Ali’.

This is a reference to the late cousin of Saddam Hussein and former Iraqi military commander who earned his nickname for his use of chemical weapons.

Apsalyamov is believed to have seen these messages, and others in which he features, and submitted a statement to the FA outlining problems he endured working under Moody and Mackay. Apsalyamov replaced Moody last year as head of recruitment.

The well-educated son of one of the richest men in Kazakhstan, and personal friend of Cardiff owner Vincent Tan, had been at the club on a 12-month internship to learn every aspect of running a football club.

Sent to members of Cardiff's staff

Apsalyamov was working in Cardiff’s recruitment department when Moody was dismissed, amid claims by Tan of overspending on transfers; allegations that have led to an ongoing £750,000 investigation into eight particular deals.

Apsalyamov left Cardiff last December amid reports there were issues with his work visa. In his statement to the FA, Apsalyamov is understood to complain he was ostracised by staff after Moody’s departure.

Wigan and Mackay’s agent, Raymond Sparkes, declined to comment. The FA investigation is ongoing.

Disciplinary chiefs also await Wigan chairman Dave Whelan’s response to being charged over comments he made about the Jewish and Chinese in trying to justify Mackay’s appointment.

May 2010: Vincent Tan is the new owner of Cardiff City.

June 2011: After Dave Jones is sacked following a Championship play-off semi-final defeat, Malky Mackay is appointed manager.

February 2012: Mackay leads Cardiff to their first League Cup final, which they lose to Liverpool on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time.

May 2012: Cardiff lose in the play-off semi-final again, but Mackay retains his post.

Tan controversially decides that the club's shirts should be changed from blue to red and the traditional bluebird emblem swapped for a dragon — causing huge unrest among the Cardiff supporters.

September 2012: Tan replaces the club's chief executive, Alan Whiteley (left), with associate Simon Lim.

April 2013: Cardiff secure promotion to the Premier League, finishing top of the Championship.

August 2013: After around £35million is spent in preparation for life in the top flight, Tan publicly tells Mackay to ensure there is a positive return on his investment.

October 2013: Mackay's head of recruitment, Iain Moody, with whom he had worked at Watford, is replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov, reportedly on work experience, although he is unable to take the job on visa grounds.

December 16: Cardiff beat West Brom in the Premier League and Mackay suggests to the Press that he will need three players in the January transfer window. Lim releases a statement on behalf of Tan that criticises Mackay for his comments and asserts that he will not be given 'a single penny' for transfers.

December 19: Mackay is emailed by Tan, informing him to either resign from his position or be sacked.

December 22: Cardiff release a club statement that Mackay will remain as manager 'for the foreseeable future'.

December 26: Cardiff lose 3-0 at home to Southampton, as fans stage a protest against Tan.

December 27: Mackay is eventually dismissed as Cardiff manager.
