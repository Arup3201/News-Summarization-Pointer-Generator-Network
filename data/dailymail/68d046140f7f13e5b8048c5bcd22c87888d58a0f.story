Algeria have suspended all football this weekend in memory of Albert Ebosse, the striker killed on Saturday after being struck by an object thrown from the crowd during a Ligue 1 match in the north African country.

The Algerian Football Federation said in a statement it was considering several punitive measures, including potentially expelling Ebosse's club JS Kabylie from all competitions, but did not specify a time period.

The Cameroon forward was struck on the head by an object allegedly thrown from a section of his club's own fans as the players left the field at the end of a 2-1 defeat to USM Alger in Tizi Ouzou, a match in which he had scored his side's only goal.

JS Kabylie confirmed in a statement posted on the club's website that Ebosse had passed away in hospital later on Saturday.

The federation said the decision to cancel all matches this weekend was also to protest 'the irresponsible action of fanatics and hooligans who perpetuate violence in stadiums which has reached unacceptable proportions'.

The federation and JS Kabylie said it had given an immediate sum of $100,000 to Ebosse's family and would ensure they were paid out the remainder of his contract.

The 24-year-old Ebosse was the leading scorer in the Algerian league in the 2013-14 season with 17 goals having played the previous season in Malaysia.

Reacting to the news of Ebosse's death, USM Alger published a statement on their own club website.

'JS Kabylie's Cameroonian striker has lost his life after being hit in the head by something launched from the stands.

'This terrible news is saddening for football in our nation and in Cameroon and arrives like a bombshell just hours after the meeting with USM Alger which was played (on Saturday) in Tizi Ouzou.

'In these painful circumstances, USM Alger and its members send their deepest condolences to the family of the deceased and to JS Kabylie. May Albert Ebosse rest in peace.'

Ebosse played for Coton Sport FC, Unisport Bafang and Douala AC in his homeland before moving to Malaysian club Perak FA in 2012. He signed for JS Kabylie in July 2013.
