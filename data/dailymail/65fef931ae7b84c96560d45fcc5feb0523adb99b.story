A teenager used a bounced cheque to swindle £13,400 worth of liposuction  from a top London plastic surgery clinic, a court heard today.

Racine Peters  obtained the treatment dishonestly from the EF MEDISPA clinic in Kensington, London in August, Hammersmith Magistrates' Court was told.

The 18-year-old is accused of obtaining thousands of pounds worth of cosmetic surgery by forging a Metro Bank letter - and presenting a cheque knowing there were insufficient funds in the account.
