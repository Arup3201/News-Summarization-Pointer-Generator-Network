Severely malnourished, he ranked he ranked the lowest number possible on the body condition scale used by veterinarians, according to Wave 3.

Charged: Madeleine Cornish, 22, was arrested on a cruelty to animal charge after leaving her puppy in a house without food or water for three weeks while she moved.

Malnourished: This is Benson when he first arrived at the animal shelter, looking like he was close to death

Heartbreaking: Police allege Cornish dumped the starving dog to avoid getting into trouble for the way she treated him

Starving: Benson is only six-months-old

Then, realizing how sick the pup had become, she allegedly dumped him.

Benson was found wandering along a street searching for food and looking physically ill.

He was taken into the care of the Arrow Fund on July 10, who have been seeing him back to health.

However staff did not expect him to survive the night when they first received him.

He ranked as a ‘1' on the body condition score chart used by vets, which is the lowest and worst number an animal can receive. 

Healthy: After one month of treatment at The Arrow Fund, Benson - now named Hank - is getting back to normal and has gained alot of weight

Benson - who has been renamed Hank - has since gained alot of weight and is getting back to normal.

'He is only five to six months old so we don't now if there's going to be a long-lasting issue with this,' Leslie Spetz, from The Arrow Fund, told WLKY.

'Its bad when it happens to any animal, but for a puppy like that and especially a large breed dog, it can have repercussions long-term.'

Benson was one of four students to feature in the little-seen Baby High, which followed young moms in the Teenage Parenting Program at Westport Alternative High School.
