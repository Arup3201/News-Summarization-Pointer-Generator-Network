After raising a staggering £1,917 the first time it appeared at auction, another piece of cake from the iconic wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge is set to go under the hammer.

The
boxed fruit cake, supplied to online auction house PFC Auctions by an 
anonymous seller, was among 650 pieces of wedding cake given to guests 
at the afternoon reception of the royal wedding held at Buckingham 
Palace last April.

The cake, designed by Fiona Cairnes, comes in a presentation tin commissioned and designed by Peter Windett and Sally Mangum.

Perfectly preserved: The cake comes in its original presentation tin with a compliment card from Prince Charles and Camilla

Three other slices of royal wedding cake 
are also set to be sold that the same auction - a piece of the Royal 
wedding cake from the 1981 marriage of Prince Charles and Lady Diana 
Spencer, one from the wedding of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson in 1986 and a slice of the original wedding cake from the marriage of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips on 14 November 1973.

All pieces of cake are reported to 
be incredibly well preserved.

Elaborate: Kate and William's eight-tiered wedding cake was created by Fiona Cairns

'These slices of cake are some of the most personal items of royal memorabilia on the market.

'They offer collectors and Royal enthusiasts the chance to own a highly exclusive item from some of the most celebrated weddings in history.

'There is a vast community of Royal collectors not just in the UK, but around the globe and as such we anticipate worldwide interest in the cake,' said a spokesperson for PFC Auctions.

Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips had a five-tiered wedding cake, made by David Dodd, for their 1973 nuptials

The demand for Royal memorabilia is reflected in the prices these items tend to bring at auction.

The last piece of Charles & Diana's cake sold at PFC Auctions of £1,756 in May 2012.

It surpassed the previous record of £1,000, set in August 2008 - corresponding to a 16.20 pa increase.

And it’s not just the cakes that are performing well.

According to the auction house, signed photos of Princess Diana increased in value by 616% between 2000 and 2012.
