David Cameron let mounting criticism of his Cornish holiday wash over him today - by going body boarding.

Opponents have accused the Prime Minister of complacency over the Iraq crisis and have publicly demanded that he return to Number 10 to get a grip on the developing crisis in Iraq.

Mr Cameron only returned to Downing Street on Wednesday morning, following the brutal execution of hostage James Foley - but went back to the West Country just 19 hours later.

Making waves: Prime Minister David Cameron clutches a body board enjoys the surf  in Cornwall

Drying off: The Prime Minister with a towel. He returned to his holiday after a 19-hour dash to Downing Street

Mr Cameron today appeared to put the stresses of high office to one side, by joining fellow holidaymakers riding the waves on a beach in Cornwall.

It comes after the  Barack Obama sparked anger in the US after being pictured laughing with friends on a golf course just hours after describing the beheading of Mr Foley 'an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world'.

Images of Mr Cameron playing in the surf come amid mounting pressure for a recall of Parliament to deal with the growing threat of Islamic State insurgents sweeping through Iraq and Syria.

In the latest developments, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who has been left in charge of the situation while Mr Cameron is in Cornwall, last night ruled out a deal with Syria’s Bashar al-Assad – despite warnings it will be impossible to defeat Islamic State fanatics without his help.

Dealing with the tyrant, who has killed tens of thousands of his people, would poison Britain’s wider diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, he said.

‘I’ve said very often that one of the first things you learn in the Middle East is that my enemy’s enemy is not necessarily my friend.

‘We may very well find that we are aligned against a common enemy, but that doesn’t make us friends. 

‘It doesn’t make us able to trust them, it
 doesn’t enable us to work with them. It would poison what we are trying
 to achieve in separating moderate Sunni opinion from the poisonous 
ideology of IS.’

Despite the protestations, some kind of deal might be reached,  with the Independent newspaper reporting that the US has already supplied Assad’s forces with intelligence about the location of jihadi leaders – allowing Syrian aircraft and artillery to target them.

The newspaper claims the German intelligence service, the BND, had been used as a back channel for the communications.

The Prime Minister returned to Downing Street for emergency meetings with the Foreign Secretary on Wednesday morning after a video was published online of the brutal beheading of Mr Foley by a jihadi thought to be British.

Mr Cameron is believed to have ordered the security services to track down Mr Foley's British killers, but pledged not to offer a 'knee jerk' response to the murder.

Speaking from Downing Street, Mr Cameron said: 'Let me condemn the barbaric and brutal act that has taken place and let's be clear what this act is - it is an act of murder, and murder without any justification.'

Just 19 
hours later however Number 10 announced that Mr Cameron was on his way 
back to Cornwall to join his third family holiday of the year - and his 
fifteenth since becoming Prime Minister. 

Mr
 Cameron today took to the water in a three quarter-length wet suit and 
brightly-coloured bodyboard after hiring boards  from a local trader.

An onlooker said: 'He seemed pretty relaxed and having a good time by himself.

'He
 didn't do any real surfing - the conditions weren't really there for it
 - but he had a go on the body board a couple of times.

'The weather was pretty good - rather sunny - and he took full advantage of it.'

Another onlooker said: 'He then walked down the beach and happily spent around 20 minutes body boarding in the sea.

'The waves were over a metre high so there was a bit of surf to play in. He seemed to really enjoy himself. After a while they all got out and walked back up the beach.'

After the surf session Mr Cameron left in his security convoy.

Government sources have insisted that he remains in full touch with Whitehall during his break with a secure phone line set up for his stay . 

But critics accused the Prime Minister of a dereliction of duty – and questioned why he has refused to recall Parliament to debate Mr Foley’s murder and the threat to security posed by jihadis who return to the UK.

In the US, 
President Obama faced similar criticism after he was pictured smiling on
 the golf course within minutes of giving a speech condemning the 
murder.

Mr
 Obama's decision to return to the golf course just hours after giving a
 sombre five minute address over the killing of Mr Foley sparked fury in
 the US.

The
 President told a global audience that 'when people harm Americans, 
anywhere, we do what’s necessary to see that justice is done'.

But
 he was then seen laughing with friends and fist-bumping them during a 
five-hour round at Farm Neck on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.

Retired
 US Army Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters could hardly contain his anger 
Wednesday night on the Fox News Channel as he discussed Obama's 
reactions to the ISIS terror network's beheading of Foley, an American 
who had been missing since 2012.

'There is no way the president should be stupid enough to go play golf' after such a somber speech, Peters said.

Cameron's security team watched the PM from the beach while he enjoyed the surf for  20 minutes

'Not only did he insult the Foley family; he sent a message to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (the leader of ISIS) and all of the other jihadi terrorist militants – now soldiers of a jihadi army – that he doesn't take it all seriously.'

Labour MP Ann Clwyd, former British human rights envoy to Iraq, was equally furious about Mr Cameron's decision to return to his holiday in Britain.

She said: ‘I just find it extraordinary that he has gone off on holiday again after a few hours back in London – it is just not good enough.

'If he is serious about the threat to Britain, as he says he is and as he ought to be, then he should not be pushing off on holiday. He should be recalling MPs to Parliament so that we can discuss the situation and debate our response.'

Meanwhile, former Army chief Lord Dannatt, once a defence adviser to David Cameron, said the West would have to talk to Assad if it was serious about destroying IS.

‘The Syrian dimension has got to be addressed,’ he said. ‘You cannot deal with half a problem. Whether it is above the counter or below the counter, a conversation has got to be held with him.‘Because if there is going to be any question of air strikes over Syrian airspace it’s got to be with the Assad regime’s approval.’

He spoke as defence chiefs put the Cyprus-based Yorkshire Regiment on ‘high readiness’ to deploy to Baghdad, as special forces focus on identifying IS commanders and British recruits.

Sun
 and sand: But critics accused the Prime Minister of a dereliction of 
duty and questioned why he has refused to recall Parliament to debate Mr
 Foley’s murder and the threat to security posed by jihadis

In the US, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Martin Dempsey said IS strongholds in Syria, as well as Iraq, would ‘have to be addressed’.

US defence secretary Chuck Hagel said the extremist group was ‘beyond anything we have seen’ and suggested that strikes in Syria would be necessary to defeat them.

But Mr Hammond was backed by Tory MP Rory Stewart, chairman of the Commons defence committee, who said: ‘I would be very, very cautious about seeing Assad as an ally.

‘He is completely unreliable and he may have his own reasons for wanting to keep IS in place in some form, because their presence relieves the pressure for regime change.’

Fellow Tory Nadhim Zahawi, who has just returned from northern Iraq, said: ‘The real issue, unpalatable as it is, is working with Iran, which holds much more sway in the region.’

However, former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: ‘You cannot get rid of the Islamist terrorist in northern Iraq and allow them to have safe haven in Syria.

‘We are all determined to get rid of this ghastly Islamic caliphate state which carried out such savage acts of terrorism and which is such a threat. We’ve got to be serious about it and swallow hard as to what is required to do that.’

The Government is under growing pressure to reintroduce anti-terror control orders to stop radicalised Britons going overseas to fight or plotting attacks at home. Independent terror watchdog David Anderson QC, his predecessor Lord Carlile and MPs criticised the Coalition for axing control orders in 2011.

These were replaced by weaker powers – T-Pims – which allowed terror suspects more freedom so as not to breach their human rights.

But not a single person is currently covered by the measures, designed to protect the public from fanatics who cannot be jailed.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We introduced T-Pims precisely because control orders were not working and their powers were being struck down by the courts.

‘People seeking to travel to engage in terrorist activity in Syria or Iraq should be in no doubt we will take the strongest possible action.’
