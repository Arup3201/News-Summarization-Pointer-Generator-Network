Cesar Azpilicueta is the standout stopper in the Premier League, according to Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher.

The Spain defender has helped Chelsea get off to a near-perfect start to the season, with the unbeaten Blues four points clear at the top of the table after 10 games. 

Azpilicueta has made the left-back berth his own and was named as the best defender by the Monday Night Football pundits.

'I'd say, for consistency of performances, it would be one of the Chelsea lads – and I'd probably say Azpilicueta,' Neville told Monday Night Football.

'For technical defending, not making a mistake, not being in the wrong position, not getting caught out… I don't see him making a mistake. And I have to say the Chelsea defenders aren't far behind him; Gary Cahill, John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic.

'But Azpilicueta, when I watch him, he's as near to perfect as possible when it comes to defending; he's immaculate.'

Carragher added: 'I totally agree. I think those Chelsea players, all of them, they defend properly.

'We see that in terms of the number of goals they've conceded, the clean sheets they keep.

'Azpilicueta is an out-and-out defender. You very rarely see anybody get the better of him. He'd be my number one.'
