A mother and son died in a fire on New Year’s Eve despite friends’ frantic efforts to save them.

Neighbours smashed down the door and even ventured inside to try to help Doreen Nicholl, 86, and her 61-year-old son John.

But the former dinner lady and her son were killed as the blaze engulfed their home. 

The victims have been named as John Nicholl, left, and his mother Doreen who died in the tragic blaze 

Neighbours tried in vain to arrest two people, in their 80s and 60s, from a fatal house fire in Deptford

An 18-year-old man broke down the door at 9.20pm, while others turned hoses on the flames. Judith Hickson, 64, rushed inside in her pyjamas to the front room where her close friend Mrs Nicholl slept.

But another neighbour pulled Mrs Hickson back outside, fearing the house in Deptford, south-east London, would blow up.

Mrs Nicholl, a grandmother of four, had lost her husband, Jim, to cancer four years earlier. John had moved in to take care of her. Mrs Hickson, who had an angina attack after the fire, said: ‘I just needed to get to her, I knew exactly where she would be sleeping so I ran inside, but the smoke was too much. Once I was in the corridor, I couldn’t see a thing, it was all orange.

‘David, who lives opposite, had been in and came out spluttering and coughing, but I thought if I could get to her, I could get her out. Then a neighbour grabbed me and pulled me outside, saying the house could blow up. Doreen was an amazing lady, everyone on the street adored her.’

Clare McKevitt, 34, who lives two doors down, used her garden hose to fight the fire. She said: ‘Windows were smashing and there was smoke everywhere.’

Police are investigating how the blaze started. Fire station manager Lee Sparks said: ‘Crews wearing breathing apparatus worked quickly to control the fire and search the house. Sadly, they found two people who had died.’

Firefighters were called to the property in Ashmead Road in Lewisham at about 9.45pm on New Year's Eve

The ground floor of the house was damaged by the blaze and firefighters found the two bodies inside it 

Around 20 crews battled to control the fire and have launched an investigation into the cause of the blaze
