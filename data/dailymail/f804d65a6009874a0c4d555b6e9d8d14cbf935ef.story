A Utah man faces five to 40 years in federal prison after pleading guilty Monday to flying 242 pounds of marijuana from northern California, which was intercepted at a small western Pennsylvania airport.

Fifty-four-year-old Ken Burrows, of Provo, Utah, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute marijuana in federal court in Pittsburgh.

The pot, worth about $1.2 million, was in sealed plastic containers.

Burrows claimed to be flying hot water tanks as cargo.

Federal prosecutors say Burrows was recruited to fly the drugs to the East Coast.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents intercepted the drugs when Burrows landed his Cessna on December 13 at New Castle Municipal Airport, about 45 miles northwest of Pittsburgh.

Last December following Burrows' arrest, Lawrence County District Attorney Josh Lamancusa told TribLive.com '[Burrows] flew at low altitude, zigzagging across the country to avoid radar towers.'

Lamancusa also told the newspaper 'He had blacked-out windows. He was landing at smaller airports to refuel.'

Burrows' plane was followed by officials with Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection, who were in a helicopter, Lancusa told the newspaper.

He told TribLive.com the agents interviewed Burrow after his plane stopped to fuel up. 

'We determined there was sufficient evidence to bring out a dog,' Lancusa said at the time.

Jim Morris, the police chief for Mahoning Township, told TribLive last December following Burrows' arrest 'The dog hit very strong on the airplane. When he got to the luggage compartment, he immediately sat down and turned his head towards his handler.'

CBS Pittsburgh last December reported Burrows' plane was flown by authorities to meet with the potential drug buyer and that he had complied with Homeland Security.

Lamancusa told the affiliate station 'We allowed Mr. Burrows to be in a separate helicopter to meet the plane at the final destination. Once they touched down, Mr. Burrows then got into the plane, completed the transaction with the target in Rhode Island and he was arrested there.'

He's scheduled to be sentenced February 15.
