If you've had enough of drinking substandard instant coffee but don't have the time to rustle up a cappuccino at home, the world's smallest coffee maker could be just what you're looking for.

The tiny gadget can deliver a perfect shot of espresso in just 30 seconds and all you need to make it work is a microwave.

The Piamo is made from food-safe plastic and includes three parts - a cup, a coffee chamber and a water holder.

The cup forms the base of the gadget and the other parts stack on top. When heated in a microwave, the water becomes steam which is then forced through the coffee.

After 30 seconds, espresso drips into the cup and once drunk, everything can be put straight into the dishwasher.

The Piamo is the brainchild of coffee connoisseur Christoph Meyl, from Munich in Germany, who came up with the ingenious invention in frustration at the lack of coffee-making facilities at his office.

With his nearest coffee shop too far away and with just a microwave available at work, desperate Christoph conjured up a solution of his own - fittingly, over a cup of coffee.

Christoph is hoping it could spell an end to the ancient hot drinks machines and cheap instant coffee abundant in offices around the world.

Piamo is being financed by German crowdfunding website StartNext and if successful will be sold for Â£60.

'The idea stems from my love of espresso,' explains Christoph.

'I work in a large building with more than 600 people and on my floor there is a small kitchen but it only has a microwave in it, and the nearest coffee shop is too far away.

'One evening during a coffee with my brother Hendrik, I [moaned] about my situation at work.

'He suggested I take an espresso pot to work, but there is no stove at work to heat it on.

'We were talking about the fact there is only a microwave and an idea was born - an espresso maker for the microwave.

He continued: 'We started our adventure and the journey began.

'We came up with several prototypes and tested them over thousands of espressos until we came up with the finished product.

'Our goal is to provide coffee lovers with an espresso maker you can use anywhere that has a microwave.

'Piamo creates a fresh cup of delicious espresso within 30 seconds. It is a great alternative for the office, at home or for travelling.'
