A Manchester United fan says his new £90 kit has been 'ruined' after his favourite player Adnan Januzaj switched squad numbers.

Eight-year-old James Collins saved up his birthday money to buy the new United home shirt as soon as it hit shops last month.

And he even paid to have the name of his idol Januzaj printed on the back and his squad number, 44, on the shorts.

Devastated: James Collins, left, spent £93.20  on a shirt with the name of his favourite Manchester United player Adnan Januzaj, right, his number 44 when the new kit went on sale. But a month later, he swapped to 11

But just a few weeks later, the young Belgian winger switched to number 11.

The number was left vacant after Ryan Giggs' retirement at the end of last season.

However, the club did not inform supporters of the planned change until Sunday, August 17 - exactly a month after the new home shirt had been released.

Januzaj has played under number 44 for three years after joining the club as a 16-year-old. 

His young fan James has now refused to wear the Nike strip, which cost him £93.20 in total, fearing he may be teased about it.

And despite pleas from his mother Cheryl, the club's Megastore have told him can't have a new shirt, as any printing is done at the shirt owner's risk.

Mrs Collins, 45, has now hit out at the club saying they have let the boy down.

The mother-of-three, who lives in Longsight, Greater Manchester, said: 'He's United mad. He has spent all summer at football camp and it's all he ever talks about.

Dream dashed: James had spent months waiting to get his hands on the new kit but he says it is now 'ruined'

'He couldn't wait to get the new shirt and kept asking when I was ordering it.

'He'd only worn it two or three times when we found out he [Januzaj] had changed number.

'We emailed and asked them if he could change it and they said no because there was a disclaimer with all printing.

'A few weeks ago the club replaced a shirt where someone had spelt Rooney wrong. That was their error.

'Yet we have done nothing wrong and have been left out of pocket. If we had any idea it was going to change I would have made him wait rather than see him disappointed.'

Last-minute change: Januzaj joined the club at 16 in 2011 and played under the number 44 until this summer

A short-sleeved home shirt from the Manchester United Megastore costs £42.

But additional lettering costs £9.95.

Mrs Collins also bought shorts, priced at £20, with an additional cost of £6 to print the number 44.

And socks, which cost £12. 

She says the system needs to change as James is 'devastated'.

'James wanted the third kit as well but I've put a stop to that now. I'm not going to let him spend money on a shirt that could be out of date straight away.'

However, a spokesman for the club insisted that notices were prominently displayed throughout the store making clear that squad numbers were not final until they are registered with the Premier League.
