The author behind the psychological thriller of the summer, Gone Girl, has said her book about a marriage turning sour was inspired by her own successful marriage, and that her lawyer husband was, in fact, her 'muse'.

Gillian Flynn, a pop culture journalist-turned-horror author, said her third book is so intensely creepy ('my goal is to make spouses look askance at each other') thanks entirely to partner Brett Nolan giving her licence to write anything she liked.

Speaking to Oliver Burkeman in the Guardian, Flynn, 42, said she wrote the book  - which has now sold over 2m copies worldwide - when the couple, who have a young son, were very newly married.

Gone Girl is the third novel by Chicago-based writer and mother-of-one Gillian Flynn, who says it was inspired by her marriage to lawyer Brett Nolan

She said: 'The funny thing, I guess is that my 
husband ended up being the muse of a book about the worst marriage in 
the world, because if he hadn't consistently said, "Don't censor 
yourself, don't worry about me" - if he'd been anxious and worried about
 it - then it would never have gotten written.'

Gone Girl  - which follows Flynn's first books Sharp Objects (2007) and Dark Places (2010) - tells the story of a marriage gone horribly wrong, and questions whether you can ever truly know the person with whom you share your life.

Set in Missouri, on the fifth wedding anniversary of 'perfect' couple Nick and Amy Dunne, the novel begins when Nick comes home to find his beautiful, trust-fund wife missing from their home amid and evidence of a struggle.

Enter the police, the media, and Amy's overbearing parents - along with some revealing entries from the missing woman's  diary - and Nick finds he must defend himself against accusations.

Fynn, who grew up obsessed with horror films as a child in Kansas ('I watched Psycho a million times') and trained as a crime reporter, says people who have read her books expect her to be a sociopath, but that mystery writers actually tend to be the 'sanest and nicest people'.

The former pop culture writer, who was fired from her job at Entertainment Weekly in 2009 due to budget cuts, added: 'It seems like the darker the books are, the nicer the person is. People say it's the romance writers you've got to watch out for.'

Actress Reese Witherspoon, left, will produce the film version of Gone Baby, and David Fincher, the man behind Fight Club, Seven and Panic Room, is rumoured to be taking the directing chair

While Gone Girl has been accused of misogyny (female characters in her writing are seldom very palatable), Flynn insists she is a feminist... just one who is wants to push against the idea that women are intrinsically loving and kind.

She is 'weary of spunky heroines'. She wants to make her ladies ugly.

She said: 'In literature they can be bad - trampy, vampy, bitchy types - but there's still a big pushback against the idea that women can be just pragmatically evil, bad and selfish.'

Reese Witherspoon saw something she understood in that sentiment. The actress is to produce the film version of the screenplay Flynn has written for the book, while David Fincher, the man behind Fight Club, Panic Room and Seven, is rumoured to be directing.
