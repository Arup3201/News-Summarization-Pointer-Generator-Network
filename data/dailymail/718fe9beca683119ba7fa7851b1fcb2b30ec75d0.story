England manager Roy Hodgson is in an unprecedented position, with all those responsible for selecting him for the post having left or being set to leave the FA.

Hodgson was chosen to replace Fabio Capello in April 2012, shortly before Euro 2012, by the Club England quartet of David Bernstein, Sir Trevor Brooking, Alex Horne and Adrian Bevington.

Chairman Bernstein left in June 2013 having reached the age limit of 70, football director Brooking retired from the FA after the World Cup, general secretary Horne is departing at the end of January and Club England managing director Bevington goes after Christmas.

Hodgson's supporters are gone (as in the case of Bernstein, left) or going (in the case of Adrian Bevington)

But with the dismantling of the Club England set-up responsible for picking the national team boss, after the previous marginalisation of the International Committee, Hodgson has no one to report to on a daily basis such is the vacuum at the top of the FA.

Hodgson, having been fortunate to survive the World Cup debacle, has since guided England to the top of their Euro 2016 group with an 100 per cent record. So there is no immediate debate around his future.

But with the 2018 World Cup qualifying draw taking place in St Petersburg next July, the FA will soon have to address whether Hodgson, whose contract runs until 2016, should be given a new deal before that or be judged purely on the Euro 2016 results.

Hodgson has led England through Euro 2016 qualifying undefeated, so his position for now is safe

UEFA may leave it as late as their executive committee meeting on January 27 - two days before the deadline for candidates for the FIFA election - before deciding whether to distance themselves from a Sepp Blatter coronation or throw their weight behind a challenger. 

Prince Ali of Jordan remains the most likely opponent to Blatter  from outside Europe who UEFA would endorse. But Ali’s situation is complicated by the president of his Asian Football Confederation, Sheikh Salman Al Khalifa, having already publicly supported Blatter. 

Dutch overlord Michael van Praag might still be persuaded to stand, but he is worried about whether he will have the total backing of his own confederation.

UEFA could leave it late to decide if they support a challenger to FIFA president Sepp Blatter's re-election

FIFA ethics chief Michael Garcia’s resignation will at least stop him harassing FA chairman Greg Dyke about his non-return of the £16,000 Parmigiani watch gifted to him at the FIFA Congress last June by the Brazil football federation.

Garcia has written a number of letters to Dyke claiming he is now in breach of the ethics code despite the New York attorney failing to disclose how many of the 65 watches handed out have been given back. 

Dyke, who has paid import duty and intends to auction the watch for the FA breast-cancer charity, was planning to show his disdain for Zurich by handing out watches to all guests at the FA media Christmas drinks.

The word inside the BBC is that the Corporation itself might have been behind the story about sharing Wimbledon coverage with subscription channel BT Sport to save money. 

It is the scenario that would have to happen if the licence fee is frozen or scrapped and the Beeb might have wanted the negative reaction to them losing Wimbledon, or part of it, out there as a message to Government.

FIFA president Blatter is obviously staying in one of the best suites of Marrakech’s famous La Mamounia Hotel for the FIFA ExCo meeting there on Thursday and Friday. 

But it is reassuring at least, considering his anti-English stance, that Blatter is not booked into the Sir Winston Churchill suite named in honour of the former Prime Minister’s stays there and where one of his self-portraits still hangs.

LTA in Virgin rumpus

The Lawn Tennis Association are involved in yet another rumpus, with plans to close down non-achieving high-performance centres.

The LTA gave notice that funding would stop next September. But Virgin Active, who don’t like the inconvenience to their members of the LTA centre at their posh Riverside club in Chiswick, are cutting links in January leaving 100 top young players between nine and 19 with nowhere to train at short notice and angry parents complaining to the LTA. 

An LTA spokeswoman said it was a Virgin Active matter.
