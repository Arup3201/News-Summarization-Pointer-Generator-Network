We will find intelligent life on other planets within 25 years, the man behind one of the world's most advanced searches for alien life has predicted.

Seth Shostak of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute made the claim at a Nasa conference looking at advanced technologies.

He believes the key is to keep scanning the skies looking for alien-produced electromagnetic signals.

The Allen Telescope Array -- named for Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen, who put up $11.5 million for the project, was one of the first dedicated SETI telescopes. It now says it believes we will make contactwithin 25 years.

Shostak told the conference the hunt for alien life was a three way race.

The players are:

'I think we'll find E.T. within two dozen years using these sorts of experiments,' Shostak said at the 2014 NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) symposium at Stanford University.

'Instead of looking at a few thousand star systems, which is the tally so far, we will have looked at maybe a million star systems' 24 years from now, Shostak said.

'A million might be the right number to find something.'

'The bottom line is, like one in five stars has at least one planet where life might spring up,' Shostak told the conference.

'That's a fantastically large percentage.

'That means in our galaxy, there's on the order of tens of billions of Earth-like worlds.'

The search for alien signals started in 1960, when pioneering astronomer Frank Drake scanned two sun-like stars with an 85-foot-wide (26 meters) West Virginia antenna.

It has ramped up considerably over the past half-century, as astronomers have taken advantage of significant advances in electronics and digital technology.

However, Seti has repeatedly warning it needs more cash to continue the search.

The 24-year estimate, for example, 'depends on continued SETI funding, which is in dire straits right now,' he told Space.com after his talk at the NIAC symposium.

Shostak told the conference the hunt for alien life was a three way race between researchers looking for advanced, intelligent civilizations; scientists scouring solar-system bodies such as Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa for simple organisms; and researchers focusing on finding signs of microbial life on nearby exoplanets using future instruments such as NASA's $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2018.

'I think any of these horses has a pretty good chance of succeeding — just my opinion — a pretty good chance of succeeding in the next 20 years, say,' he said during the NIAC talk.
