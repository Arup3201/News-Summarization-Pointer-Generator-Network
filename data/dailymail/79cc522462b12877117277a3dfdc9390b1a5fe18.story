Visit: Martin McGuinness will sit down with Fiona Woolf, the ceremonial leader of the City of London, at a banquet in the Guildhall - just a few hundred yards from the sites of two massive attacks during the 1990s

Former IRA commander Martin McGuinness will be wined and dined by the Lord Mayor of London this week - despite the trail of devastation wrought in the Square Mile by Irish republicans.

He will sit down with Fiona Woolf, the ceremonial leader of the City of London, at a banquet in the Guildhall - just a few hundred yards from the sites of two massive attacks during the 1990s.

The dinner will take place half a mile from the atrocities - the Baltic Exchange in 1992 and Bishopsgate in 1993 - which caused hundreds of millions of pounds of damage and killed four people.

The invitation was accepted by Mr McGuinness as controversy rages over his decision to attend a state banquet at Windsor Castle with the Queen.

The events are part of a four-day state visit of Irish president Michael D Higgins - the first ever by an Irish head of state - starting tomorrow (Tues).

Mr McGuinness is Northern Ireland’s Deputy First Minister and represents Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. He first met the Queen two years ago at a jubilee event in Belfast, when he shook hands with her both in public and in private.

However the former MP, who refused to sit in the House of Commons because of an oath of allegiance to the monarch, had snubbed a gala banquet in her honour at Dublin Castle during a ground-breaking trip to the Irish Republic in 2011.

But he has now decided to attend a similar event at Windsor Castle next week - as well as being a guest of the Lord Mayor of London, the ceremonial head of the City of London, London’s financial district.

Three major bombs exploded in the Square Mile during the Troubles, including a 1990 bomb at the Stock Exchange.

Last night Lord Tebbit, who was injured in the 1984 Brighton bomb which left his wife Margaret in a wheelchair, said: ‘I imagine that most people in the City will not be unduly pleased.’

But he said that neither the Queen not the Lord Mayor had control over who was invited to these sorts of banquets - that was down to diplomats.

Prince Philip’s uncle, Lord Mounbatten of Burma, was assassinated by an IRA bomb planted in his fishing boat in 1979.

‘Mr McGuinness is there on the coat tails of the Irish ambassador - it’s up to him whose company he chooses to keep,’ said the former Tory party chairman.

‘It makes it very difficult for the Palace and for the Lord Mayor. Mr McGuinness owns up to being a member of a terrorist organisation, those who suffered at the hands of the terrorists are not best pleased.

‘The Queen no choice in matter; she can hardly refuse to invite the Irish ambassador. I imagine it is difficult for her - her family has suffered at the hands of the IRA.’

He added: ‘There’s always the possibility that a member of the Real IRA will be so outraged by Mr McGuinness bowing to the Queen that they might shoot him in the back for it. We can but hope.’

In a statement, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said: ‘Sinn Fein seeks a new and positive relationship between Ireland - all of Ireland - and Britain based on equality and mutual respect for the first time in our troubled history.

‘We also seek an agreed, united Ireland which accommodates those who define themselves as British. It is within this context that I can confirm that Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness will accept an invitation to attend all events as part of the state visit.’

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘There is a long-standing practice of not commenting on individual invitations. That said, Her Majesty is greatly looking forward to this historic state visit and welcoming all guests to Windsor Castle.’

Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘Whilst the man concerned has engaged in things in the past which have created appalling mayhem and tragedy, today we are looking at healing those rifts.

‘But would I want to sit beside him at dinner? No, I certainly would not.’

Highlights of the visit will include an address the president will make to both Houses of Parliament - another first for an Irish head of state. Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina will also visit the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon.
