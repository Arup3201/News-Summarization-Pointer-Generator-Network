Honeymoon murder-accused Shrien Dewani suffered a 'panic attack' outside court today when photographers surrounded his car and banged his window with their lenses, according to his lawyer.

Dewani nodded his head for emphasis when Francois van Zyl asked Judge Jeanette Traverso to remind the media of his client's fragile 'mental health'.

South African authorities have a limited time in which to convict or acquit the 34-year-old for his alleged role in the murder of his wife, Anni, during their honeymoon four years ago.

Fragile mental health: Shrien Dewani (pictured at the start of the trial) suffered a 'panic attack' when photographers banged their cameras on the window of his car, his lawyer told his murder trial today

Any relapse in Dewani's mental health could see his trial interrupted or abandoned.

'We want to see justice done and incidents like that mean that justice may not be done,' the judge scolded the reporters in court, requesting that the media 'treat the accused and the case with the necessary dignity'.

Since the start of his high profile trial, Dewani has betrayed little sign of the post post traumatic stress disorder and severe depression that prevented his return to South Africa to face charges over the contract killing of his Swedish bride. 

His sensitivity to noise was said to be so profound that he was allowed to live in a camper van in the grounds of a mental hospital in Bristol as he waged a legal battle against extradition.

Once he was extradited, however, Dewani's mental improved quickly and dramatically, and was deemed fit to stand trial just four months later.

A panel of mental health experts said while the wealthy businessman remains vulnerable to tears, distress, panic attacks and startling from 'sudden ambient noises', he is clear of depression.

Amid obvious fears that his mental health could falter, the South African authorities have gone out of their way to minimise any stress for Dewani, who is being held in a private room at a psychiatric hospital where he is allowed special privileges. 

He is driven to and from court in the back of a hospital car each day. 

The number of reporters given access to the room at the Cape Town high court has been strictly limited and pictures were only allowed to be taken in the first minutes of Dewani appearing in the dock.

Applications to televise Dewani's hearing in the style of the Oscar Pistorius murder trial, which was screened and debated around the clock on a pop-up channel, were turned down flat.

During the five hours or so he sits in the dock every day, he appears quite relaxed and able to follow proceedings easily, occupying himself with files of legal papers and writing notes to his legal team. 

Occasionally, he seems bothered by the banging of a door at the back of the court or coughing from the packed gallery – on one occasion he was seen to mouth 'shut up' at an elderly member of the public observing from above.  

However, coming face to face with his wife's killers and the gay escort he had paid for sexual humiliation and physical abuse appeared not to leave him in any obvious emotional discomfort.

Convicted taxi driver Zola Tongo – who is the state's main witness against Dewani – today spent a second day under cross-examination, and was forced to admit to discrepancies in his story.

Mr van Zyl highlighted a number of stark contradictions between Tongo's evidence to Dewani's trial this week, his statement to police four years ago - a week after Mrs Dewani's murder and subsequent plea and sentencing agreement.

Tongo – who claims he was recruited by Dewani to stage a carjacking as the cover for his wife's murder - was given a reduced sentence for his part in the killing in exchange of giving evidence against Dewani.

Asked by Judge Traverso whether he realised how important his plea and sentencing agreement was at the time he signed it, and which now varies with his recollections in the witness box, Tongo replied, 'My Lady, at that time my condition was weak. As time went on, I remembered.'

Two hitmen recruited to kill Mrs Dewani by a middleman called Monde Mbombolombo, were both jailed for their roles. 

Mbombolombo was given immunity from prosecution for his co-operation with police. 

It was revealed today that he gave a fresh statement to police only last month, but it is not yet known whether this will help Dewani's case or not.

Dewani denies five counts, including kidnap and murder.

The case continues.
