Strictly's Claudia Winkleman has been targeted by an internet troll who set up a fake Twitter account pretending to be her badly burned daughter.

The troll used the name Matilda Winkleman and handle HotWinkle to mock the eight-year-old's accident on Twitter after her witch costume caught fire during an evening of trick-or-treat.

Direct messages have been sent to the TV presenter, with one saying: '@ClaudiaWinkle what's your daughter's favourite dance? I'm guessing the #HotStep.'

Another said: 'I was eating some monster munch at the time of story - Flamin' Hot flavour.'

At least five tasteless tweets were sent from the same account, including: '@ClaudiaWinkle I fancy a bacon sarnie, extra crispy' and '@ClaudiaWinkle is it hot today or is it just me.'

Matilda Thykier is being treated for severe burns after a candle on a doorstep of a house she was visiting set light to the cape of her witch's outfit last Friday.

Her mother is expected to miss the second weekend of Strictly shows to look after her daughter in hospital.

Several other Twitter users have exchanged offensive tweets about the accident which shocked the presenter and her husband Kris Thykier, both 42.

Maximus Spacticus under the Twitter handle ‏@CSpacula said: 'At least she won't have to fork out for a Halloween costume next year....#ClaudiaWinkleman.'

Another Twitter user with the name Biggie Halls and handle @Loubmeupscotty said: 'Claudia Winkleman isn't presenting Film 2014 tonight. I don't want to suggest her daughter being burned was a good thing, but...' 

Last night  a source close to the couple told The Sun: 'This is the last thing they need at this difficult time and they will be devastated and stunned that anyone would sink so low and mock a badly injured child.'

An expert has said the the presenter and her daughter have been targeted by a 'professional' troll who set up an account specifically to attack them.

Restaurant owner Jamie Poulton said he was just feet away when he saw Matilda’s black ‘wizard’s costume’ turn into a ‘crackling ball of flame’.

He suffered second-degree burns when he plucked the eight-year-old from a group of children and put out the flames with his bare hands.

To his horror, the synthetic fabric melted in his hands as he tried to tear it from the screaming child.

Zoya Bacolv, seven, was out trick-or-treating with her two sisters Isla, five, and Laila, eight, and a group of adults when the accident happened.

Zoya said of Matilda: 'She was outside a house when her cape caught fire, I think she was dressed as a witch. I think it was a candle outside a house that set her cape on fire.

'I saw her when the ambulance came, they had to wrap her up to put out the fire.

'She burnt her leg. They put her in a cast thing and put lots of plasters on her leg. She's going to be hospital for a week. It was really scary.' 

In a statement, the couple said: 'Our daughter was involved in an accident on Friday night while celebrating Halloween. She is having the best care possible and we are hopeful of a full recovery.

'We would like to thank everyone who has been so supportive and particularly the NHS doctors, nurses and staff who have been absolutely incredible.

'We would like to take this opportunity to remind anyone taking part in fireworks parties or Guy Fawkes celebrations to be vigilant about the dangers of candles, open fires and fireworks and to please have the appropriate safety measures in place and to hand.'
