Television stars from Colombia have been filmed fighting with Brazilians, with plates being thrown across a restaurant as both countries count down to their quarter final clash in Fortaleza.

The fight broke out after the two parties exchanged insults before grappling and throwing crockery as other restaurant-goers tried to pull them apart.

It is the latest in a series of unsavoury incidents in the build up to Friday's game - with Brazil fans setting off fireworks outside the Colombia team hotel at 4am on the night before the game in a bid to disrupt their South American neighbours.

The Colombians, spending time in Brazil supporting the outsiders in Friday's game, were then thrown out of the Brazilian eatery.

Manolo Cardona and Carolina Guerra are the two Colombians identified in the video as things got heated - although it is unclear who started the disagreement.

Cardona is an actor while Guerra is a television presenter.

Video from the restaurant shows plates being thrown and a widespread scuffle as one man is left with a bleeding head wound and punters try to drag those involved away from each other.

Onlookers seemed shocked by the disturbance and police are at the scene to deal with the matter towards the end of the clip.

Brazil and Colombia both face huge pressure as the World Cup reaches its climax and both sides are desperate to progress in Friday's game.
