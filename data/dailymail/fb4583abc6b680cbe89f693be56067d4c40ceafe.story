In the next few days, the Supreme Court is set to weigh in on affirmative action, but it seems Americans already have.

Support for the controversial programs is waning, with less than half of Americans saying they believe affirmative action is still necessary to counteract racial discrimination, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday.

Only 45 per cent of respondents said affirmative action programs are a 'good idea'. Out of 1,000 Americans polled between May 30 and June 2, 45 per cent also said such programs 'unfairly discriminate against whites'.

Split: In a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 45 per cent of respondents said they support affirmative action and 45 per cent said they felt it caused discrimination against whites

In 1991, 61 per cent of registered voters polled supported affirmative action—meaning the programs' approval has plummeted 16 per cent in 22 years. Just three years ago in January 2010, 49 per cent of poll respondents supported the programs.

NBC reported the dip might be attributed to the effects of having an African-American president or 'diversity fatigue'—when companies tire of constantly fighting to diversify the workplace during a recession.

'Certainly, the election of Barack Obama as president has made a difference,' Indiana University law professor Kevin Brown told NBC. 'I did not believe America would elect a black president in my lifetime. There’s no question America is a much more tolerant, open society than 20, 25 years ago.'

One poll respondent told NBC she used to support such programs.

'Right now, I feel like it’s reverse discrimination,' the respondent, a 69-year-old white Rhode Island resident told NBC. 'I did support it at first, but, gradually, because of this reverse discrimination it’s gone too far.'

Support for affirmative action in the poll was racially divided. Six in 10 or 56 per 
cent of whites polled do not support the programs while the majority of 
black and Hispanic Americans polled do.

Affirmative: The Supreme Court will hand down a decision in the case of Abigail Fisher, right, who believes she was kept out of the University of Texas at Austin unfairly because of affirmative action

Decisions: The Supreme Court is expected to rule on an affirmative action case in the next few days

The poll comes as the Supreme Court revisits the constitutionality of affirmative action. In October last year, the court heard arguments in the case of Abigail Fisher, who claims she was not chosen for admission to the University of Texas in 2008 while less qualified minority applicants got spots.

'There were people in my class with lower grades, who weren't in all the activities I was in, who were accepted into UT. And the only difference between us was the color of our skin,' Fisher told NBC last fall.

The court is expected to rule on the case in the next few days, according to CNN.

In 2007, the court ruled public schools could not use race as a 'tiebreaker' when determining a student's admittance to certain high school and kindergarten programs in Seattle, Wash., and Louisville, Ky.

'The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,' Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion on that case.

In 2003, the court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action policy. That same year, 49 per cent of adults polled supported those programs, according to NBC.
