A playground dealer was charged with supply class A drugs at an infant, junior or primary school in 2013, according for figures released as part of a Freedom of Information request

Drug dealers sold heroin and amphetamines outside an Essex primary school, it has been revealed.

The dealer was charged with supplying the class A narcotic in 2013, according to figures released by Essex Police as part of a  Freedom of Information request. 

The figures come just weeks after it was revealed in parliament that one primary school age pupil  is suspended every week for being drunk or high on drugs.

The figures released  last month showed that in 2012-13, 40 children at primary schools in England were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs.

The Department for Education said it included alcohol abuse, drug dealing, inappropriate use of prescribed drugs, possession of illegal drugs, smoking and substance abuse.

There are 39 weeks in the average school year, meaning more than one pupil aged 5-11 is suspended every week.

 At secondary school the situation is even worse, with 6,500 pupils excluded in 2012-13. 

Tory MP Andrew Griffiths, who obtained the figures, told MailOnline:'It is deeply worrying that so many children appear at school under the influence.'

As part of a Freedom of Information request Essex Police confirmed it had investigated a total of 122 drug offences at schools in the county since 2010. 

They also dished out a warning for possession of cannabis at a nursery or creche in 2012.

In 2012-13, 40 children at primary schools in England were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs, meaning more than one pupil aged 5-11 was suspended every week during term-time

In each instance the school has not been identified and the force has been unable to say exactly who was involved.

A total of 32 offences were committed by youths and all but 15 involved the possession of cannabis.

More than half  were dealt with by a reprimand, caution or warning, while a further 25 received some form of community resolution.

In 17 case someone was charged. 

At secondary schools, 6,500 pupils were temporarily excluded in 2012-13, sparking warnings that parents and teachers are 'losing the battle' against substance abuse

Nick Alston, Police and Crime Commissioner for Essex, said: 'It is disturbing to see evidence of any drug-related activities taking place in educational establishments.

'However, it would be naive to believe this doesn't go on as, for many years, some young people have been tempted to experiment with drugs.' 

Ray Gooding, Essex county councillor for education, said: 'The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of the utmost importance.

'We work with schools throughout Essex, along with partner agencies, to educate pupils on drug misuse.

'However, we are not complacent and as these figures demonstrate, there is still work to be done.'
