It was 40 years ago that society photographer Richard Young got his first major break. Since then, he has snapped photos of the most famous stars in the celebrity pantheon.  

Billed as one of the most important photographers of the 20th century, Young's diverse portfolio includes Elizabeth II and Diana, Princess of Wales, Joan Collins, Kate Moss, Angelina Jolie, Andy Warhol, Marvin Gaye, Mick Jagger and Stevie Wonder, to name just a few.

To celebrate his four decades in the business, the Richard Young Gallery is displaying his most iconic pictures in an exhibition of 'ready-to-buy' photography.

Pret-a-Photo displays Young's knack for capturing his subjects in unexpected, often tender moments. There's the diptych of a grinning David 
Bowie turning the lens back on Young, and the picture of a young Kate 
Moss being made-up backstage.

Young's first really famous picture, The Kiss, shows an enraptured Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton locked in embrace.

Speaking to The Telegraph in 2011, Young said 'This is one of the most passionate pictures I have taken.

'It positively bristles with it. There was no doubt among those in the room that night that this was a couple deeply in love. It’s a beautifully warm photograph. It was 1974, and the actors had recently wed for the second time after their first marriage ended in divorce.

'Liz organised a 50th birthday party for her husband at the Dorchester hotel.

'It was strictly no press, but I had a tip-off, so I gatecrashed. Once the dinner was over, a massive birthday cake was wheeled into the room and I started shooting. Liz and Richard cut the cake and kissed in a wonderfully tender moment.

'Because I got the only picture, I ended up being practically kidnapped by another photographer who wanted it,' Young said.

Another famous photograph has Mick Jagger playfully brushing Jerry Hall's wavy blonde hair.

'She always looked glamorous, and managed to look classy as well," he told the Telegraph.

'Mick, of course, with his mobile mouth, was a wonderful subject.

'In this 1987 photograph, they had just left San Lorenzo restaurant in London and were in merry form.

'I've been photographing Mick for 35 years. He's always been a gentleman about it.'

Candid: 'I always got the access I required,' Young has said, as this photo of Johnny Depp and Kate Moss at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, 1995, shows

This wasn't a given - especially these days, given the modern paparazzo's pugnacious tactics. But Young was able to snap such candid photographs because his gentle demeanour often gave him the in he needed.

'In the early days I was always very lucky,' Young told The Independent in 2010. 'It had to do with charm and being nice to people.

'I always got the access I required or requested, always in the nicest possible way.'

And the results speak for themselves. Pret-a-Photo is open until January 31st.
