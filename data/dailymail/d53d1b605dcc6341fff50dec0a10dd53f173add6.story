They say that pets become more and more like their owners as time goes by.

So it should come as no surprise then that, like his master, Larry the Downing Street cat is himself fond of a little ‘chillaxing’ now and then.

And on a day when Britain basked in the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures reaching a sizzling 27c (81f), who could blame him.

Taking it easy: Larry the Downing Street had more of a reputation for chillaxing outside on the pavement than catching mice - until now

Stretched out in the Midday sun the brown and white tabby slumped down on his side and took a well-deserved cat nap just a few feet from the door of Number 10.

Larry, a rescue cat from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, was given the title of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet and was chosen by Downing Street staff to tackle a growing rat problem last year.

But since his arrival he appears to lack the killer instinct and instead of boasting an impressive kill ratio Larry has become better known for his...sleeping.

He may not have to worry about the eurozone crisis or hauling Britain out of recession, but that didn't stop Larry seemingly neglecting his rat catching duties when he soaked up the sun yesterday.

Is David Cameron too 'chillaxed' to run the country?

David Cameron attracted some criticism for his own 'chillaxing' last week following claims in a biography that he spends weekends at Chequers singing karaoke, playing tennis against a machine dubbed ‘The Clegger’ and downing several glasses of wine with lunch.

His latest afternoon snooze came as Britain baked.

After the wettest April on record and perhaps the coldest start to May in 70 years the mercury is finally beginning to move in the right direction.

Sunseekers poured onto the country’s beaches whilst others headed into the garden for a spot of sunbathing.

Creature comforts: Larry, pictured last year, appears to enjoy a cat nap as much as any other feline

Those at the Chelsea Flower Show were left wilting whilst one man and his dinghy floated out to sea in South Devon sparking a major rescue operation.

Incredibly Britain was hotter than parts of Australia, South America, Africa and the Middle East. It also left most of the Mediterranean in the shade.

And the temperature is expected to rise even further today (thurs).

Forecasters said it could reach up to 28c (xxf) in the south and south east - and best of all, the glorious sunshine and blue skies are here to stay for at least a fortnight.

Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: ‘It is bikini and ice cream weather for almost the whole country.

Running talks: Earlier in this week's G8 summit talks at Camp David, Mr Cameron and President Obama staged a 35-minute 'treadmill summit' side by side at the gym

‘Pretty much everywhere has temperatures in the 20s Celsius and wall-to-wall sunshine.

‘In recent weeks we had low pressure over or close to the UK, bringing rain and cold temperatures.

‘Over the last couple of days, that has given way to high pressure, sunny weather and rising temperatures from the Continent.’

At 26.9c (80.4f) yesterday (wed) was the hottest day of the year, but it is expected to get even hotter today (thurs). It will be 28c and sunny in London.

Summer sun: Larry's sunbathing session came as the rest of the UK enjoyed a gloriously hot May, including here in Aviemore, Scotland, where temperatures reached 26.9C

Basking: Rhianna Mallia, 18, and Louise Dougherty, 21, were just two of the many people who enjoyed the sun in Aviemore, which posted the hottest temperatures of the year in the UK yesterday

Bizarrely, the highest temperature was not recorded in the south but in the Scottish ski resort of Aviemore.

It also hit 26.9c (80.4f) at London’s Heathrow Airport, 25.9c (78.6f) on Bournemouth’s beaches and 25.6c (78.1f) in London’s St James’s Park.

Supermarkets reported a surge in sales of sausages, burgers and summer tipple Pimms as well as picnic treats such as pork pies.

Five million sausages - 70 per cent more than normal - are expected to fly off supermarket shelves over the weekend as the country makes the most of the mini heatwave.

Not the only one: Larry the cat was one of many who decided to kick back yesterday, including angler Arthur Cansfield in the Lake District

Asda also predicts it will sell one million burgers, half a million bags of salad - 20 per cent more than in a normal week - as well as a 115 per cent increase in burger bun sales.

Chris Carden, Asda’s head of fresh food supply, said: ‘We have already seen rising sales throughout the week of typical BBQ fare such as burgers and sausages but with the mini heatwave expected to continue into the weekend, we’re expecting it to be one of the biggest we’ve ever seen for barbecue foods.’

Only days ago the country endured temperatures up to 4c colder than the average for this time of year.

Ironically, the sweltering weather comes amid a relaxation of the hosepipe ban which was imposed by seven water companies on April 5 after months of drought only for it to rain almost non-stop for the rest of the month.

Meanwhile, the arrival of the sun saw betting firm Ladbrokes slash the odds of the temperature soaring past 39c (103f) during the Jubilee weekend from 20/1 to just 8/1.

Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: ‘It finally looks like summer has arrived, and the odds suggest the Jubilee weekend could be a scorcher.’
