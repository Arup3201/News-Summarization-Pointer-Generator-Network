The discovery of the dismembered body of a Thai bar dancer has sparked an international manhunt for a British man wanted for questioning in connection with her death.

Thai police have named 45-year-old Shane Looker, from Stoke-on-Trent, as the last person known to have been in contact with murder victim Laxami 'Pook' Manochat.

The dancer's body was sliced into pieces before it was stuffed inside a suitcase and thrown into the Mae Klong River in Kanchanaburi, 70 miles south of Thai capital Bangkok.

Wanted for questioning: Shane Looker, left, originally from Stoke-on-Trent, is wanted by police in Thailand in connection with the murder of Laxami 'Pook' Manochat, right, who was found dismembered in a suitcase

National police in Bangkok said Looker and Miss Manochat were captured on CCTV leaving the Nana Plaza in the city, an area that nightly attracts hundreds of foreign men in search of drink and sex.

Looker had entered Thailand on October 31 and was last seen with Miss Manochat on November 2, police said. The suitcase - weighed down with rocks - containing her body was found in the Mae Klong River on November 9.

Investigators' first task was to identify the victim's remains. Once that was done they were able to identify Miss Manochat leaving Nana Plaza with a well-built white man.

CCTV images of the pair were distributed across Thailand in an effort to identify the tourist, but his identity remained a mystery until a tip-off to Thai blog Stickboy.

The blog was provided with Looker’s full name, nationality, and an address in Hua Hin, 90 miles south of Bangkok, along with a photo of his passport. The information was passed to police.

Officers went to the address with a search warrant and although Looker had already left, they found the shorts and T-shirt he had allegedly been wearing on the night of November 1, when he was captured on CCTV.

DNA taken from a number of items, including nail clippers and a toothbrush, matched DNA found under Miss Manochat’s finger nails.

The investigation also led officers to a shop where Looker allegedly bought rocks similar to those found weighing down the suitcase containing Miss Manochat's dismembered body.

A new line of inquiry began - searching for the driver who took Looker out of Bangkok with Miss Manochat.

It had been thought the pair had travelled straight from Bangkok to Kanchanaburi in the early hours of November 2. But police discovered he had checked out of Gulliver’s Hotel in Bangkok later that morning, taking a minibus bound for Hua Hin at 9.30am on November 2.

What police have not disclosed is whether Miss Manochat was with him in the minibus.

Further inquiries, said police, have ascertained that Looker fled Thailand into Malaysia, travelling by train over a border crossing, on November 24.

The Thai blog said it is understood that from Malaysia Looker headed to Ibiza where he reportedly spends the European summer months and has a share in a hotel in Ibiza town.

Thai police said they were seeking the assistance of Interpol to find the suspect.
