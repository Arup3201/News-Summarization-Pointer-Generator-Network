A U.S. military veteran with multiple tours in Iraq has exposed just how easy it is to travel to Syria and fight against ISIS, suggesting it's as easy as flying to Miami.

The 33-year-old veteran told how he bought a  plane ticket, underwent an informal background check on Facebook and was 'approved' to fight on the front lines in Syria against the Islamic State.

In a revealing interview, the fighter, who asked to be identified as 'John' said he took the trip from America to Syria with ease and joined a Kurdish group known as the YPG.

U.S. military: John's military background appeared to be an asset to the fighters, who arranged for him to be met at the airport in Iraq from where was taken to the front lines

There are currently over 1000 foreign fighters travelling to Syria each month, according to official figures

He told Fox News: 'I just went online and bought a ticket. It was that easy. It was like booking a flight to Miami Beach. 

'There was a Facebook page for it -- shot them a message, expressed my interest, they got back to me, told me to send them, essentially, a resume for their vetting purposes,' John explained. 

'What I believe is that they are European go-betweens, they are not in Kurdistan, they operate receiving information of interested Westerners, and then they either relay it or make a decision themselves of whether or not this person is suitable to work with the YPG,' he added. 

'They sent a message saying I was approved and someone would be waiting on me.'

John's military background appeared to be an asset to the fighters, who arranged for him to be met at the airport in Iraq from where was taken to the front lines.

But the Kurds, whom he was fighting with, were so poorly equipped that he had to stuff his vest with a Bible because there was no body armor. Meanwhile some 'soldiers' had never handled a gun.

The American revealed that he met dozens of international fighters from Scotland, England, Canada and Australia while in Syria.

There are currently 1000 foreign fighters travelling to Syria each month, according to official estimates. 

British: James Hugh, left, and Jamie Read, right, greatly exaggerated their story of going out to Syria to fight

John said: 'I got in a car and there was a guy from Scotland there. So that was kind of refreshing, to see that I'm not the only one, it helped affirm to me, hey, I actually am with the good guys.' 

But not all soldiers who travel to the region are fighting on the front lines as claimed.

Two former British soldiers, who claimed that they had risked their lives in a battle against ISIS to avenge the beheading of aid worker Alan Henning were exposed for exaggerating their story.

According to The Mail on Sunday  Jamie Read and James Hughes were in fact in the region to obtain videos and pictures for financial gain.

And testimonies by ex-soldiers revealed that the British soldiers stayed in a plush four star hotel because they didn't like the 'safe house' that they were taken too.

Support: Lieutenant General James L Terry, commander of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve said: 'The [Kurds] are considered allies and we are in many ways enabling them

There is widespread confusion over U.S. policy on penalties, if any, for foreign fighters who travel to Syria. 

The Supreme Court argues it's not a crime for a U.S. citizen to go overseas and join a foreign army. But if the recruitment took place inside the country, it may be against the law.

The U.S. military is backing Kurdish operations while the State Department discourages direct involvement by U.S. citizens.

Lieutenant General James L Terry, commander of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve said: 'The [Kurds] are considered allies and we are in many ways enabling them when you look at the strikes that have been going on in places like Kabani, I'm pretty comfortable we're supporting them right now.'

John fled the front line after ISIS put a bounty out for him. He headed to the U.S. Consulate in Iraq and is still not sure what the legal penalty for his actions will be.

He told the U.S. embassy: 'I'm an American first.'
