Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football.

This week, Mad Dog has his say on Ray Wilkins' suitability for another job in football, Sam Allardyce's football is producing results at West Ham, and what he has which is 'similar' to Dennis Bergkamp's statue at Arsenal...

UPS AND DOWNS

I thought Ray Wilkins was very open and honest talking candidly about his mental health in football throughout his career, after his dismissal from Fulham last week.

It's something many managers and coaches, including myself, have to overcome.

Losing your job in any walk of life is tough. But being in the public eye in a job that you love, the incredible highs and lows, always being busy, it can be very difficult to cope.

Brave: Ray Willkins spoke openly about his illness throughout his career after his dismissal from Fulham

Experience: Any club would be lucky to have a coach of Wilkins' standard

You are a councillor, decision-maker, long-term and short-term planner, recruiter, teacher, charity worker, supporter and mentor. As well as picking the team and sorting out training for the players.

Then it's just one phone-call, or text message, or email, and it stops. Just like that.

Soon the texts and phone-calls stop and the buzz – the same buzz as all supporters feel come match-day times 100 – is gone from your life.

You're lonely, isolated and wondering what the future brings.

I'm not sure how you define depression. But I've felt a lack of energy, questioning your own ability, questioning if you'll ever work again and generally feeling fed up, sad and, at the want of a better word, bereavement.

Frank: Wilkins was speaking to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton about his troubles

Everyone else gets on with their lives and I guess that feeling is called depression.

I'm sure Ray will get an opportunity in football once again. He's a gentleman, full of knowledge, had great success and I see it as a strength that he has got help from a therapist and specialists in place to support him and, most of all, give him guidance for the future.

This will, in my opinion, improve him and he will get better as a manager or coach.

God bless. We must never forget, although people quickly do, the tragic loss of Gary Speed less than two years ago, who seemed bright and bubbly on Football Focus just the day before.

I believe more has to be done to help and support managers who are out of work.

LUKE'S A SHAW THING FOR ENGLAND

On Saturday I got the chance to visit my old stomping ground to watch West Ham versus Southampton.

I'll tell you one thing I'm sure about and that's Southampton's 18-year-old left-back Luke Shaw.

He's got pace, he's also got another gear, and goes forward with intent to do damage in the final third.

He was tested one-on-one defensively all afternoon and he didn't get beaten once.

Solid: Luke Shaw has the credentials to go all the way, he didn't get beaten once against West Ham

Competition: I can see Shaw usurping Ashley Cole (left) and Leighton Baines in the England team

Perhaps his decision-making in defence was at fault when he didn't track Matt Jarvis's run for West Ham's first goal.

But in time, and with experience, that will improve.

It looks from afar that Chelsea are letting Ashley Cole slowly run-down his contract and my guess would be that young Shaw will be moving to Stamford Bridge in the summer.

With Leighton Baines edging towards 30 - though, it must be said, he has improved with age like a fine bottle of wine - I'm sure young Shaw will be filling the England left back spot for many, many years to come.

THE WEST HAM WAY

A lot has been said about Sam Allardyce's way of playing. But I have not yet seen a book or manual that states how you have got to play to win a game of football.

Sam has his way and after four straight wins, with his main players now available, not one West Ham supporter would've left Upton Park without a spring in their step and the claret-and-blue blood bubbling around their body.

Southampton's Mauricio Pochettino had his team playing from the goalkeeper, through the back four, then the midfield, into the forwards, with both full backs overlapping.

They were focused on ball retention and moving the opposition to create openings, with a South American style that is good to watch.

Results: Sam Allardyce is getting the three points with his system, and has lifted West Ham into the top half

Route one: Kevin Nolan's goal typified the impressive performance

On Saturday, when the Saints goalkeeper had a goal kick, Southampton's two centre halves pulled deep and wide, level with their own six yard box and the two central midfield players dropped off to the edge of the penalty area to receive passes to start their attack.

At no point did he smash it long. If those players were marked the keeper attempted a 30-yard pass with the full backs pushed high-up and wide in the wing positions.

West Ham's goalkeeper, Adrian, kicked the ball 70 yards directly to Carlton Cole and in one instance the knock-down came to Kevin Nolan.

Regret? Mauricio Pochettino had his team pass the ball out in defeat, while West Ham celebrate the win (below)

His half-volley attempt at goal was blocked and the next pass was played to Stewart Downing, who on his second touch tried to get a cross in. It was blocked and went off for a corner.

With only three passes the Upton Park crowd were on the edge of their seats in eager anticipation as the corner came in.

The crowd loved it and at the end of the day, with three points on the board, I'm sure not one West Ham supporter could turn round and say, 'I don't know why we don't play out from the back and tip-tap it about in our own 18-yard box'.

NO MATCH-WINNERS, NO WINS

A lot has been made about the lack of goals from the Barclays Premier League teams in Europe last week.

But it surely can come as no surprise.

Swansea City didn't have Michu playing.

Tottenham were missing Emmanuel Adebayor.

Man City didn't have Sergio Aguero in their side.

Arsenal, no Olivier Giroud.

No surprise: Manchester City and Arsenal were missing their main strikers in midweek in Sergio Aguero (left) and Olivier Giroud

So the main strikers, the match-winners, who win these games and make the difference, if you don't have them playing, you don't win.

If Arsenal had signed Luis Suarez they'd have won the Premier League and gone very close in the Champions League this season.

Yaya Sanogo looks decent, but he's hardly Suarez, Dennis Bergkamp or Thierry Henry, is he?

Potential: But Yaya Sanogo isn't going to be the next Arsenal legend (like Luis Suarez could have been), is he?

MAD HOT DOG

Speaking of Bergkamp, I see Arsenal have recognised the incredible contribution of one of the game's most amazing players with a statue at the Emirates.

His incredible talent was so similar to Eric Cantona, with his arrogance and supreme confidence.

He used to strut around like the King of Highbury, more often than not walking with his eyes squinted like a kestrel looking calmly and quietly for the gap or the opening where he could punish the opposition.

He was magnificent, one of best of all time.

Legend: Dennis Bergkamp deserves his statue outside the Emirates Stadium

Not quite: The closest I've ever come is... a Chilli Mad Dog!

In 2012 they unveiled a statue of Sir Alex Ferguson outside Old Trafford. At West Ham, you've got the famous Bobby Moore Stand. In Chelsea's Stamford Bridge they've got the Zola Lounge. There are loads of them.

And a couple of years ago my son George rang me with the news that a street vendor was selling a hotdog with chilli and mustard called the Chilli Mad Dog.

Sadly no stand, or statue.

On Tuesday night, Vassos Alexander and
 Chris Hollins were left speechless for the very first time when I was 
with them on BT's SportsHUB.

They were shocked and horrified with my prediction that England would win the World Cup.

With
 their mouths wide open, and all planning from rehearsals now out the 
window, I explained that with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Raheem Sterling, 
Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck, Daniel Sturridge, Wayne Rooney, and with 
Stevie G playing deep in front of the back four, we have a team with 
pace and self-belief that can test and challenge the very best.

You just wait and see.
