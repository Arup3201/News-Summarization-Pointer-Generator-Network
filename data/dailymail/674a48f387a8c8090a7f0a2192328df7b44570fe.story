Want to know what boho babes Poppy Delevnigne, Kate Moss and Sienna Miller will be wearing next season? Look no further than Matthew Williamson's AW15 collection.

Taking the crown for best show venue, Matthew unveiled his designs at the decadently designed Criterion restaurant in central London on Sunday.

The mystical and bright hued collection was inspired by the signs of the Zodiac and by taking such a point of reference, he maintains that his designs cater to  every woman's tastes.

Flowing silk dresses came slashed to the hip and were often embellished with bold blue crystals inspired by  birth flowers, horoscope signs and stones. 

Fur is officially in fashion come autumn, if Matthew's catwalk is anything to go by.

Shaggy Mongolian lamb and shearling in topaz,  teal, and pink sent Instagram into a furry frenzy.

Beauty-wise, Benefit's Lisa Potter-Dixon created a look echoing the garments we saw on the runway.

'I wanted to do something that complimented the feminine curves of his clothes and the zodiac signs, which are very structured,' she told FEMAIL backstage ahead of the show.

Lisa explained that she wanted Matthew's girl to be a cool Brit - a muse he sticks to season upon season and one that reflects his clientele.

After prepping the skin and eyes, Lisa added volume and definition to the models' brows with cult product, Gimme Brow, brushing up the inner corners for an 'undone' look.

The brand's Boi-ing concealer was the key product behind the look and Lisa used it to prep eyes before 'layering and layering' cream and metallic shadows six times.

Black bad gal waterproof eyeliner was used on the upper lash and water line and Lisa reapplied concealer to fill in gaps and add depth.

'Using concealer is perfect because you can also cover any mistakes without having to use makeup remover,' she said.

The brand's best-selling They're Real mascara was used on only the top lashes to keep eyes 'looking wide awake'.

Hello Flawless Oxygen Wow gave a glowing complexion and Hoola bronzer provided the contouring.

Rather than using a liquid highlighter, Lisa opted for long wear powder shadow in Gilt-y to highlight.

'I've applied it onto the bridge of the nose and cheekbones and buffed it in to complement the jewel tones of his collection and the beautiful building we're in,' she explained.

'Matthew's girl will literally blend in with the ceiling.'

For lips, boi-oing concealer came into play once more, and was mixed with hydra-smooth lip colour in Air Kiss.

Lisa shunned lip liner and simply patted the duo into models' lips with a slick of gloss for a 'healthy' finish.

Mark Hampton for Toni & Guy Hair Meet Wardrobe coiffed the models' locks to perfection. 'We're going for that cool 70s girl; she's very Matthew,' he told us.

He began by prepping the hair with heat protecting mist and hair was given some oomph courtesy of 3d Volumiser.

Glamour Sky High Volume Dry Shampoo was used to take off any shine before he created movement, waves and bends using two different size tongs.

He did a touch of backcombing at the crown to give it a 'hippy Woodstock' vibe (something we witnessed here last season, too).

Two pieces of the models' hair were then clipped back by their ears using invisible elastic bands, which Mark explained stopped it from looking 'too retro' or 'puffy'.

'The girl this season is older and cooler,' he added. 'It's a punky 70s vibe but real, as though the girl had done it herself.

'It's organised chaos.'
