With the rules that govern modern society relaxing by the day, you'd be forgiven for thinking the stereotypical strait-laced Brit was gone for good.

Not so, according to a new study, which revealed that sex, death and money are the three conversation topics guaranteed to have Brits break out in a cold sweat.

Asked to rate the most uncomfortable conversation topics, more than half of those questioned said they find sex the most difficult to discuss with partners and friends.

Surprisingly for those who assume women 
love to gossip about their bedroom antics, it was revealed the fairer 
sex struggled with broaching the topic more than their male 
counterparts.

Death and money were second and third on
the list of taboo topics, with almost a third of those questioned 
saying they couldn't bear to discuss death, and 22 per cent saying 
they found probing conversations about finance excruciating.

Other conversational toughies include telling your family you’re ill, letting someone know that a loved one has died, or asking a family member for money.

Shockingly, those topics were considered more difficult to discuss than asking for a divorce, with just one in five claiming they would find this conversation the most difficult to initiate.

Discussions about inheritance entitlement rounds out the top five most difficult chats.

When it comes to financial matters, many families bury their heads in the sand, with one in 10 surveyed by Santander Insurance admitting that they were unfamiliar with their partner’s financial affairs. Only four in 10 well-informed types said they were abreast of everything.

If the worst was to happen and they lost their partner unexpectedly, just over a quarter say they would have no idea what would happen to their partner’s estate.

Conversation killer: After sex, death is the second most loathed topic to talk about

1. Sex

2. Death

3. Money

4. Divorce

5. Inheritance

Santander spokesman Steve Burton said: 'Despite there being numerous ways to communicate these days, people still find it tricky to talk about the ‘taboo’ subjects of sex, death and money.

'When it comes to financial matters, no one likes thinking about what may happen if a loved was to die or be diagnosed with serious illness but these difficult conversations do need to be had to ensure that family and dependents are aware of any financial provisions they can access.

'Putting steps in place to prepare can certainly help if the worst was to happen. Our research found that three in 10 people admit to having no plans or provision to secure their future financially.

Yet life insurance can be relatively inexpensive, with premiums starting from as little as £5 per month, and can provide reassurance to people that their loved ones will be financially secure if they die or suffer a critical illness.'
