Probe: David Cameron's inquiry into union antics has been lambasted by Unite directors

Militant union bosses last night warned their members not to ‘collaborate’ with a government inquiry into the use of bully-boy tactics in industrial disputes.

David Cameron ordered the probe into Unite’s tactic of sending mobs of demonstrators to protest outside the homes of company directors.

But senior Liberal Democrats voiced concerns, saying they would not allow the review – which they insist will also examine tactics used by some companies – to become an exercise in ‘union bashing’.

Unite’s political director Jennie Formby described the probe as ‘nothing more than a Tory election stunt which no trade unionist will collaborate with’.

Her comments suggest that members who assist the inquiry will be seen as collaborators – a loaded term often used to describe those who helped the Nazis during the war.

The TUC also dismissed the inquiry as ‘politically driven’. Sarah Veale, head of employment rights at the union, said: ‘It is a completely disproportionate response to one or two instances.

‘It is really quite disgraceful that the Government is pretending that there is a real public interest concern here.’

The inquiry was launched after the Daily Mail revealed the true nature of the so-called ‘leverage tactics’ used by Unite during the bitter dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland.

Unite targeted the directors of the plant’s owner Ineos, staging a demonstration with a giant inflatable rat outside one executive’s home.

One director said he had feared for the safety of his wife and his two young children after 30 Unite protesters descended on his drive in the school holidays.

Dispute: Unite's political director Jennie Formby has blasted the review as a 'Tory election stunt'

Unite general secretary Len McCluskey has always denied any intimidation or bullying on the part of the union. 

But Mr Cameron said a review was needed to examine whether the law needs tightening to prevent intimidation.

Unsure: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said he would not back a clampdown

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said it was right to investigate ‘quite unpleasant examples of intimidation against fellow workers and against management’.

‘First of all we need to examine the facts and then to see whether the law needs changing,’ he said.

The review by Bruce Carr QC, a leading industrial relations lawyer, will investigate the issue of ‘leverage’ tactics, as well as the impact of such disputes on the critical national infrastructure.

Mr Carr will head a three-strong panel, with a representative each from employers and unions. He is expected to report back in six months. 

A source close to Vince Cable said the Lib Dem Business Secretary had insisted the review also examine ‘inappropriate behaviour’ by some companies, including blacklisting suspected troublemakers.

Nick Clegg also insisted the review would look at ‘irresponsible behaviour by the unions and by business.’ But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander was explicit that the Lib Dems would not back a clampdown on unions.

He said: ‘If there are measured, sensible, prudent reforms that could help to improve the industrial relations landscape yet further, I’d be up for that. What I’m not up for is a bunch of union-bashing.’

However, Tory sources said the ‘main focus’ of the review would be on the activities of the unions.

The row over Unite’s behaviour has been acutely embarrassing for Labour leader Ed Miliband, who is heavily reliant on the union’s cash to keep Labour afloat.

And former Grangemouth employee Stevie Deans is at the centre of a controversy over allegations Unite tried to rig the selection of a new candidate for the safe Labour seat.

Meanwhile First Minister Alex Salmond yesterday condemned the review as a ‘foolish and irresponsible’ political manoeuvre.

Tactics? A panel will look into groups such as Unite, led by Len McCluskey, and tactics they are accused of using

The Labour Party leadership ‘approved’ Unite’s political activities in Falkirk, according to a leaked report.

In a formal response to allegations of vote-rigging in the safe Labour seat, Unite said the party was ‘well aware of Unite’s political strategy activities in Falkirk and approved of it’.

The union has been accused of signing up people as Labour members without their knowledge in a bid to rig the selection of a parliamentary candidate.

The leaked document reveals that the Labour inquiry made a series of devastating findings against Unite, including there was ‘no doubt that members were recruited in an attempt to manipulate party processes’. Ed Miliband has repeatedly refused to publish the party’s dossier on the affair.

Unite denies any wrongdoing.
