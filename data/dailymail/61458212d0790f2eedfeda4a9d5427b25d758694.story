A two-storey property used as a set for the Australian television show, Underbelly,   will be put under the hammer on Saturday.

Once a dairy factory, the 1908 warehouse located in Richmond in Melbourne, Victoria, has had a stunning town-house makeover that hopes to see the property sell for $1.1 million plus. 

'For auction on Saturday, we’re hoping to see it achieve close to $1.3 million. We’ve got about 3 or 4 people interested – had over a hundred people inspect it.

‘Lots of empty- nesters looking for a change and hoping to buy away from city locations after selling their big family homes, but also some trendy singles interested,’ agent Jodie McCarthy told Daily Mail Australia.

Once a dairy factory, the 1908 warehouse located in Richmond in Melbourne, Victoria, has had a stunning town-house makeover that hopes to see the property sell for $1.1 million plus

The two-bedroom, two-bathroom home has been described as spacious and modern home, featuring large open spaces and a double garage.

‘It’s all very open – there are no walls, the bathroom and shower is all open – if you look up from the breakfast bench you can see right up at the shower, Ms McCarthy said. 

The property was last sold in 1999 for $487,000 and displays an outdoor courtyard area that is half-opened, half-covered.

'It was last renovated in 1999,' she said. 'The property has a really bold colour scheme – it's current owners painted it recently with striking red and blues.' 

If those modern and spacious features do not help sell the stunning renovated property, then maybe it's television air time will help appeal buyers.

Ms McCathy said the property was featured in the first season of Underbelly, a drama series that exposes the criminal gangland side of Melbourne.

The TV crew were shooting in their home for a week or two

In season one, episode 5, 135 Brighton Street was Zarah Garde-Wilson's home - the struggling lawyer who dated convicted killer Lewis Caine.

'The home was used as the steamy love scene in the shower as well as some of the downstairs section of the house,' Ms McCarthy said. 

Current owners Corrine and Nigel said the TV crew were shooting in their home for a week or two. The couple said it is common for film makers to 'come knocking on the door every so often'.

'Just the uniqueness - it's an old Richmond dairy factory so it's got the original stables out of the back and stable doors and it's just one big open space.' 

'The open plan is great for them and for their filming - it's good for lighting due to natural light and easy to work in cause there's no doors,' Corrine said. 

'"Why are you leaving?" Everyone is asking!' 

'It's a bit sad. We've been here for 16 years and it's just a new phase in our life. 

'We're upsizing - we're going for three storeys this time'. 

Corrine said a lot of people have called the 'rustic and gorgeous' property - 'The Underbelly house'. 

The home is located in an up and coming location and is near trendy cafe spots.
