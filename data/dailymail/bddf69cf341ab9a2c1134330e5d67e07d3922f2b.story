Parts of the Houses of Parliament were closed off today due to fumes from a fire.

The small blaze is understood to have been in a room at the House of Commons end of the building in the early hours of this morning.

Sources said there was no significant damage but areas were being cordoned off because of the potential danger from toxic substances such as asbestos.

Blaze: Areas of the Houses of Parliament were closed off this morning after a fire

Areas including the Commons chamber were off-limits to members of the public as a result.

It came days after it was warned The Houses of Parliament could close for up to five years under plans to carry out a £3billion taxpayer-funded refurbishment.

MPs would be forced to relocate to a replica chamber if the plans to overhaul the Grade I listed building go ahead.

It would be the first time that the Commons and Lords has been left empty since the Second World War.

Commons officials have warned that the historic building is suffering from chronic subsidence, electrical problems, fire risks, plumbing leaks and is full of asbestos.

Even the boilers, dating from before the Second World War, are said to be 'ready to blow'.

The worst problems are linked to subsidence caused by decades of Tube trains rattling past the foundations and work on the underground car park.

These have caused Big Ben's bell tower to tilt 18 in from the vertical – enough for tourists to start noticing. Cracks have also started to appear in the walls of the Palace.

The problem is so severe that MPs are even being asked to consider the radical proposal of selling off the historic building and moving into newly built offices – a move that could net £500million for the Exchequer.

The House of Commons commission, chaired by Speaker John Bercow has asked a group of MPs, peers and officials to report on options to save the building.

They include building a new parliament, temporarily evacuating for refurbishment or continuing with decades of limited repairs during the summer holidays. The £3billion would not be spent until the next parliament, which begins in 2015.

Between 1940-41, both Houses of Parliament were convened at Church House, Westminster, due to fears of bombing. They were hit 14 times by German air raids.
