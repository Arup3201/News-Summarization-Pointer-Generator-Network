Retired professional swimmer Gerald Rioual of France has just set a new Guinness World Record for most underwater bench presses.

The father-of-two lifted a 110lb barbell 36 times in just 90 seconds without any assistance from a breathing apparatus - he didn't even wear a snorkel.

The record was previously held by Marcello Paredi of Italy.

The father-of-two successfully completed 36 underwater bench presses of a 110lb barbell

He bet his two small children that he could beat Marcello Paredi's 20-rep record - and he was right

Rioual got the idea that he could beat the record in his head when perusing the 2013 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records with his two young children.

He bet them he could beat Paredi's record... and, staying true to his word, Rioual did just that off the coast of the Caribbean island of Martinique.

Paredi set the bar (so to speak) on the record's weight requirement after completing 20 repetitions in succession on the set of Lo Show de Record in Rome, Italy, on February 25, 2010.
