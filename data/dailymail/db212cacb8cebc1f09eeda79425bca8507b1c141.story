Falklands war hero Simon Weston has pulled out of standing as one of Britain’s first Police and Crime Commissioners saying it had become ‘too political’.The former Welsh Guardsmen, who suffered horrific burns to 46 per cent to his body during the Falklands conflict in 1982, announced his decision on Twitter on Monday.He tweeted: ‘With regret pulling out of the PCC role for South Wales. Became disillusioned by the fact it was getting too political and not serving the people.’

Too political: Falklands war hero Simon Weston announced he won't be standing as one of Britain's first Police and Crime Commissioners.

Tweeting decision: Weston tweeted his reasons why he stood down from the race to become the Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales.

Mr Weston, who lives in Cardiff, had planned to stand as an independent candidate for the £70,000 year job.

A previous criminal conviction when he was 14 had also brought Mr Weston's standing into question.

The legislation creating commissioners bars candidates convicted of imprisonable offences.

Mr Weston was convicted and fined for being a passenger in a stolen car but Home Secretary Theresa May assured the former soldier that he could apply for the role despite having a juvenile criminal conviction.

The law was not aimed at people who had a conviction at the age of 16.

As a Coalition flagship initiative, the commissioners will replace police authorities in England and Wales and set the police force’s budget and strategic direction. The Falklands veteran is well known for his recovery from horrific burns and for forging an inspiring career as a charity worker, children’s author and motivational speaker.

Inspiring career: Mr Weston, pictured with sons Stuart (on the right), James and grandson Zach, wanted to make a contribution and stop ageing politicians taking commissioner roles

When the father of three announced his decision to stand in February he urged others to follow his example to stop ageing politicians taking the roles.

He said: ‘Why should the politicians corner the market? Why they should have any greater insight to life?

‘There are so many talented people out there who haven’t had a chance to do their bit yet.‘I’m going to stand as an independent candidate because I believe I can make a contribution and bring something different.’

Other candidates still in the running are former Labour deputy prime minister John Prescott and Iraq War veteran Col Tim Collins.

The new roles have been criticised by Labour as a bad idea that risks politicising the police.
