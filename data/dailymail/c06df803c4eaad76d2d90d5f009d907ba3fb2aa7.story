A San Francisco woman who claims she was attacked and robbed in a local bar because she was wearing Google Glass is helping police find her assailants after she used the device to capture video footage of them.

Sarah Slocom, a tech writer, was showing off the high tech glasses in punk rock bar Molotovs in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood Friday night when she says two women confronted her and a man ripped the Google Glass off her face. She says another person then stole her purse and cell phone.

She managed to get her Google 
Glass back complete with video of the suspect she said. She's handed 
this to police who are using it to track down her anti-Google Glass attackers.

Glass: Slocum, right, and a friend pose with their Google Glass

Stolen: Sarah Slocom, pictured showing a friend how to use the high tech glasses Friday night, just minutes before a man ripped the Google Glass off her face

Slocom first complained of the attack on
 her Facebook page, posting: 'OMG so youâ€™ll never believe this but... I 
got verbally and physically assaulted and robbed last night in the city,
 had things thrown at me because of some w***er Google Glass haters...'

Slocom says she was simply showing friends how to use the new technology when the attack happened out of no where.

However, a witness, Brian Lester, told 
KPIX5 news that she was being irritating, filming people on the device 
without their consent.

Google has previously used the I/O developer conference to unveil new technologies such as Glass, pictured here worn by co-founder Sergey Brin. Google Glass recently launched in the UK and was developed by Google X - a facility devoted to technological advancements

He said he watched a man insult Slocum, then a man accompanying her retaliated with his fists.

'The crowd was jeering as any last call crowd would do with a fight outside of a bar,' Lester told the station.

'She was running around very excited ... and people were telling her, "you're being an *** take those glasses off."

'I think everybody was just upset that she would be recording outside of a bar this late with obvious embarrassing behavior going on. And just rather insulted that someone thinks it's okay to record them the entire time they're in public.'

Slocom says her purse and phone are still missing.

The altercation comes just a week after Google released a list of dos and don'ts for Glass users including 'don't be creepy or rude (aka, a "Glasshole").'
