Sami Osmakac, 25, from the former Yugoslavia, has been charged with an alleged plot to attack crowded locations in Tampa, including a nightclub

A 25-year-old Muslim man born in Kosovo allegedly developed a bomb plot to attack crowded locations in Tampa with a car bomb, machine guns and other explosives.

Sami Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Kosovo - a disputed Balkan state once a part of the former Yugoslavia that declared its independence from Serbia in 2008 - was charged today with one count of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.

Osmakac, of Pinellas County, Florida, 
allegedly bought explosives and guns from an undercover FBI agent, which
 had been made unusable.

He told the agent last month that he wanted an AK-47-style machine gun and Uzi submachine guns, investigators said.

Osmakac was arrested on Saturday and is due to appear in court on Monday after being charged over the alleged bomb plot in Tampa.

Shortly before his arrest he made a 
video of himself explaining his motives for carrying out the planned 
attack, authorities said.

In the eight-minute video he is seen cross-legged on the floor with a pistol in his hand and an AK-47 gun behind him, authorities said.

He said in the video that Muslim blood 
was more valuable than that of people who do not believe in Islam, 
according to a criminal complaint.

Osmakac allegedly added that he wanted 'payback' for wrong that was done to Muslims and bring terror to his 'victims' hearts' in Tampa.

A confidential source allegedly told federal officials in September 2011 - the 10th anniversary of 9/11 - that Osmakac wanted Al Qaeda flags.

Two months later he talked with the source and ‘discussed and identified potential targets in Tampa’ that he wanted to attack, authorities said.

Osmakac allegedly wanted help getting 
the firearms and explosives for the attacks, and was put in touch with 
an undercover FBI employee.

Last month Osmakac met with the agent and allegedly told him that he wanted to buy weapons including an AK-47-style machine gun.

He also allegedly wanted Uzi submachine guns, high capacity magazines, grenades and explosive belt.

Osmakac
 gave the agent a $500 down payment for the items in a later meeting and
 outlined his intentions to build bombs, authorities said.

He
 allegedly wanted to build bombs to go in three different vehicles, blow
 them up remotely and conduct a follow-up attack using his other 
weapons.

Osmakac allegedly said at another meeting earlier this month that he wanted to bomb
 night clubs, a business and the Operations Center of the Hillsborough 
County Sheriff's Office. It is also believed he wanted to blow up an Irish pub and Starbucks coffee shop.

He allegedly added that he wanted to 
detonate a car bomb and use the explosive belt to ‘get in somewhere 
where there's a lot of people’.

Osmakac told the agent that he wanted to take hostages and then demand something from the 'kuffar' - an Arabic word that means infidels or disbelievers of Islam, authorities said.

'Once I have this…they can take me in five million pieces,' Osmakac allegedly told the agent, referring to law enforcement officers, reported ABC News.

'I want to do something terrifying, like one day, one night, something's going to happen, then six hours later something else,' he allegedly told the agent. 'This is going to terrify them.'

The FBI believe he unsuccessfully tried to get other people to carry out attacks too, reported ABC News. The agent told Osmakac he could always change his mind about his plot.

Osmakac - who was arrested in Tampa for battery four months ago - allegedly shook his head and stated: ‘We all have to die, so why not die the Islamic way?’

Criminal complaint: Osmakac has been charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and if convicted could be fined $250,000 and jailed for life

Authorities do not believe he planned 
to attack the Republican National Convention, which will be in Tampa in 
August. But they thanked the local Muslim community for assistance in 
the investigation.

According to the affidavit, he also told
 the agent: 'Honestly, I would love to go for the Army people, but their
 bases are so locked up, I have to do something else.'

'We all have to die, so why not die the Islamic way?'

Osmakac said he wanted to take down bridges that link Tampa to neighbouring Pinellas County.

'This will crush the whole economy,' authorities claimed he said to the agent. 'This would crush everything man, they would have no more food coming in. They would, nobody would have work.'

He was allegedly arrested after he was shown by the agent how to arm a bomb and he connected what he believed was a detonator, preparing to drive off.

Osmakac has been charged with attempted 
use of a weapon of mass destruction and if convicted could be fined 
$250,000 and jailed for life.
