Britain's internet giants have agreed to put extra money into the fight against sickening child abuse images – but are refusing to install automatic filters that would force users to ‘opt in’ to online pornography.

At a Westminster summit, the top four internet service providers pledged an additional £1million over four years to the Internet Watch Foundation, a charity which works to remove indecent images from the web.

Firms including BT, TalkTalk, Facebook and Google signed a ‘zero tolerance’ agreement on child abuse images at the summit, hailed by Culture Secretary Maria Miller as a triumph.

Web firms have come under scrutiny after recent high profile murders. Stuart Hazell had visited child abuse sites before the attack on Tia Sharp

But critics said the agreement was toothless, and the summit had taken no real action on protecting children from stumbling across pornographic images.

Attendees at the summit – which despite apparently being a Number 10 priority was held while David Cameron was at the G8 summit – agreed to meet again in the autumn to discuss progress.

Web firms have come under scrutiny in recent months following the convictions of Mark Bridger and Stuart Hazell for the murders of five-year-old April Jones and 12-year- old Tia Sharp. Both men had visited child abuse sites before the attacks. Last night the parents of both children called for more action to tackle child porn.

The Daily Mail has campaigned for opt-in filters which would force computer users to indicate they wish to have access  to pornography.

April’s mother, Coral Jones, said: ‘I just want it stopped and I think the Government should put more pressure and get it done now.’

Tia’s father, Steven Carter, said: ‘You’re fuelling the beast and it needs to be stopped – it should have been stopped a long time ago when these people were setting up companies.’

The companies which attended the summit in the Houses of Parliament were Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, BT, BSkyB, Virgin Media, TalkTalk, Vodafone, O2, EE and Three.

The internet service providers (ISPs) signed up to a new approach, which will involve working more closely with the police to seek out and block images of child abuse.

The £1million funding – on top of £1million pledged by Google last week – will allow the foundation to seek out images of child abuse rather than just responding when they receive a complaint.

The money will also help  intensify its work with the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), which prosecutes abusers. In addition, the ISPs agreed to introduce ‘splash’ pages by the end of the month.

This will mean that if someone seeks to access a page of illegal images that has been blocked, a warning message will tell the user they have tried to access indecent or illegal content.

Mrs Miller said: ‘The abuse of children is absolutely abhorrent – and that child is further violated every single time an image is circulated and viewed. The IWF and CEOP already do important and valuable work.

‘This agreement will mean these organisations will no longer be limited to reacting to reports received.’  Labour media spokesman Helen Goodman said: ‘I would describe this as a total damp squib. They seem to have agreed an expansion of the IWF and an extra £1million. They have not even begun to get to grips with our call for action on web filters to protect children. I feel disappointed and frustrated.’

A statement released by the four largest ISPs – BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media – said the extra £1million would be spread out over four years.

‘This additional funding will supplement the existing zero-tolerance approach to child abuse material online,’ they said.Scott Rubin, director of public affairs at Google, said: ‘We have a zero tolerance attitude to child sexual abuse imagery online.

‘The fight to remove these images from the internet is a global one, and we hope these measures will help in that important battle.’

Last night a poll revealed the majority of the public are behind the Mail’s campaign for an automatic block on online porn. The ComRes poll for ITV News found that 73 per cent say search engines should filter out all pornographic online content unless people specifically opt in to access it. Just 12 per cent disagreed, with 15 per cent saying they were not sure.
