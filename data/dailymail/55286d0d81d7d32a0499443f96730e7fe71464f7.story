A truck bomb containing eight tonnes of explosives and capable of destroying an area nearly a mile wide has been defused in Afghanistan.

The bomb, which was wired and ready for detonation, is the single biggest discovery of its kind ever in the country and forms part of a huge deadly arsenal uncovered.

Security forces linked the weapon to insurgents from the Islamist insurgent group, Haggani Network, which is connected to Al-Qaeda.

Captured: Two men arrested in connection with the bomb are pictured alongside the explosives today

Devastation: The explosives could destroy an area nearly a mile wide, according to security officials

The bomb contained sodium chloride, ammonium nitrate, diesel and other chemicals, and was found in east Kabul.

Gun fight: Two people were captured during the fighting which followed the discovery and five insurgents were killed

Five insurgents were killed during the fighting that followed on Wednesday, while Two others have been arrested in connection with the bomb.

Maps and information on military locations were also discovered in the vehicle. The militants were planning to target a military facility in Kabul, according to security officials.

National Directorate of Security (NDS) spokesman, Shafiquallah Tahiri, said today: 'This truck bomb could have destroyed an area around 1.5 km in radius.

'Now can you imagine that what kind of catastrophe this would be?

'NDS forces discovered it due to prior information that the terrorists were organising an attack in a crowded part of Kabul.'

The discovery came two days after the U.S. defense secretary Chuck Hagel had left the capital.

Although the discovering is the largest of its kind, it is not the biggest collection of explosives ever seized in the country.

In March last year, border police seized 17 tons of explosives in the southern province of Kandahar.

A month later, members of the Taliban were caught with 10 tonnes of explosives, which they had planned to use in a terrorist attack in Kabul.

The explosives were in 400 bags and hidden under potatoes loaded in a truck with Pakistani license plates.

Suicide bombs and explosives hidden in vehicles remain a key security concern in Afghanistan, more than a decade after the U.S. led invasion.

In 2007, a close friend of Prince William, Joanna Dyer, was one of four soldiers killed by a roadside, which ripped through a Warrior tank.Â 

On the first day of Mr Hagel's visit last week, a suicide
bomb attack happened less than a miles away from a NATO facility where 
he was in meetings.

In other developments this week, officials in the southern Helmand province released a grisly image of six Taliban fighters apparently killed by police after attempting to ambush a patrol.

It is believed that the gunfight also involved troops from the NATO coalition, and local tribal leaders claimed that the militants were shot at from helicopters.

Police also displayed a cache of weapons captured from Taliban fighters in Jowzjan province.

Attention has also turned to Australian soldiers serving in Afghanistan, who have been criticised for sunbathing and playing golf while on the front line.
