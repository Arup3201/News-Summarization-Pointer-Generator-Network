Guilty: Ketut Pujayasa has admitted to the rape, attempted murder and sexual abuse of a 31-year-old passenger on a nudist cruise he was working on

A cruise ship worker brutally beat, raped and tried to throw a passenger overboard because he believed she insulted his mother.

Ketut Pujayasa, 29, changed his plea in the Miami courtroom to guilty on charges of attempted murder and aggravated sexual assault.

Pujayasa's court-appointed lawyers declined to comment on why their client opted to plea rather than face trial. 

They also did not disclose what length of sentence they would recommend to the judge.

Earlier this year, it was revealed how a 31-year-old American woman was found 'painted in blood from head to toe' after being beaten and raped by Pujayasa, a cabin steward, on a Holland America cruise ship. 

Pujayasa claims he attacked the 31-year-old because she insulted his family when he tried to deliver her breakfast on Valentine's Day.

The vicious assault on the woman only came to a halt when passengers, who heard the commotion inside the stateroom, began banging on the door. 

The 29-year-old cruise ship worker told the FBI he used a master key to break into the passenger's room at night time, and attacked her in her bed.

The ships' doctor, a 40-year veteran emergency room physician, told FBI agents that the woman was so severely injured he thought she might die.

'In his 40 years, he had not seen such a violent attack,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Francis Viamontes said. 'Every witness who saw her said she was completely covered in blood.'

The woman, who was on a Bare Necessities nudist cruise, was saved after a fellow passenger pounded on her guestroom door, allegedly scaring off Pujayasa who claims to have jumped to a lower balcony to escape.

FBI agent David Nunez testified that Pujayasa, a room service attendant on the ship, confessed to his roommate and gave to a statement to authorities.

Pujayasa allegedly told police he decided to attack the woman, who has not been named, after she told him: 'Wait a minute, son of a b****' when he knocked on her door with her breakfast.

'Pujayasa stated that the passenger's comment of 'son of a bitch' was offensive to himself and his parents. He was angry and upset the rest of the day.

He interpreted the comment as an insult to his family and sought revenge.

Pujayasa told the agents that he was accustomed to personal insults and verbal abuse from rude passengers but lost it over what he said was an insult to his family.

'He made that point over and over again, that it wasn't about insulting him, it was about insulting his family — especially his mother,' Agent Nunez said. 

Pujayasa, who is married and lived with his wife, parents and three siblings in Indonesia, had no prior criminal history in the U.S. or his native country, officials said. 

'The passenger also noted that [the victim] had a curling iron wrapped and tangled around her neck and/or hair. He also described [her] as having black eyes and visible bruising around her neck and shoulders.

'[The woman], fearing death was imminent, asked the passenger to relay to her family how much she loved them,' the FBI report stated.

The cruise ship docked in Honduras and the victim was airlifted to a Florida hospital. Security guards on the ship detained Pujayasa until they arrived in the Everglades.

The victim had been on an eight-day cruise with nudist vacation specialists Bare Necessities, which took in Jamaica, the Bahamas and Honduras on a voyage that left Florida on February 9.

As well as traveling to exotic destinations, guests were able to take part in couples massage, Tantra classes, a production of the Vagina Monologues and a Captain's party, according to the travel company's website.

Guests on the cruises, which had been run previously on the Nieuw Amsterdam, are required to wear clothes only when the ship is in port, or when they are at dinner or attending the Captain's party. 

Agents said Pujayasa, who is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 140 pounds, inflicted a horrific beating and sexual assault on the woman, a U.S. citizen identified only by her initials in court.

He said he fell asleep on her balcony while waiting for her to return, remained hidden until she lay down and closed her eyes, then violently attacked her, agents said.

Pujayasa said little at Monday's hearing. He wore tan and brown jailhouse scrubs and earphones that enabled him to hear an interpreter.

'If this case were to go to trial, do you believe they could prove what they just said,' U.S. District Judge Jose E. Martinez asked.

'Yes,' Pujayasa said.

Martinez followed up: 'Is it true?'

'Yes,' Pujayasa again said.

Pujayasa was arrested when the ship returned to Fort Lauderdale, and he was immediately fired from his job.

Had the case gone to trial, he could have faced life in prison if convicted. He will likely be deported if he ever gets out of prison.
