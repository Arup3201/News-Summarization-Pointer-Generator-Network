Retailers like Target, Macy's, and Old Navy are starting their Black Friday sales earlier this year, but Walmart is surpassing their efforts by extending its Black Friday deals through the entire weekend.

Bloomberg News reports that Walmart will include five days of sales both online and in stores  on Thanksgiving Day and continuing through 'Cyber Monday'. Walmart sales will begin at 12:01 a.m. for online only, with in-store sales beginning at 6 p.m.

'Black Friday has become Black Friday week,' Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart's chief merchandising officer, said in a statement Tuesday. 'Our customers want to shop when they want to shop so we’re trying to expand the times and product availability with them.'

And expanding they are.

Black Friday: Wal-Mart announced Wednesday, that Black Friday will be a five-day event this year 

Today reports that the five-day event will begin Thursday with Walmart offering discounts among many categories including kitchen appliances, toys, and DVD and Blu-Ray movies.

Just two hours later, Wal-Mart will offer markdowns on electronics like Beats By Dr. Dre portable speakers. 

One reason Wal-mart and other retailers are pushing for a longer Black Friday event is because of the competition among the retailers, according to Today. 

'You've seen a number of retailers pull forward their events … and you're seeing a lot of activity, which tells me [this holiday event] is going to be very competitive,' Mac Naughton said

ABC News reports that another reason retailers are expanding Black Friday sale events is because customers are using smartphones and other devices to compare prices before they go to check out the deals in stores.

A bunch of retailers are giving shoppers multiple grabs at Black Friday deals by opening hours earlier than usual.

Target Corp. officials announced that it would open at 6pm on Thanksgiving day, two hours earlier than they opened last year, according to Bloomberg.

Other retailers are following suit. J.C. Penney Co., Staples Inc., Macy’s Inc., and Best Buy Co. are opening earlier than ever on Thanksgiving day. 

Online Shopping: About 49 percent of consumers plan to turn to their electronics to research products and make purchases online this year

These retailer's effort to lure more shoppers into their stores may prove futile in an age where most people are shopping online. 

Bloomberg news reports that about 49 percent of consumers plan to turn to their electronics to research products and make purchases online this year. 

'Black Friday is no longer an event for customers who wake up at the crack of dawn to get great deals,' Mac Naughton said. 'It’s become a family shopping tradition where everyone shops at some point throughout the weekend.'
