A Boston woman has been indicted with
fraudulently obtaining $8,000 from the fund set up for victims
of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, and thousands more from
other fundraising, officials said on Thursday.

Investigators found that Joanna Leigh, 41, was at the Boston
Marathon on April 15, 2013 when two bombs exploded, killing
three people and injuring more than 260, but they argued that
she was not injured, the Boston Police Department said in a
statement.

Leigh was indicted earlier this month by a Suffolk County
grand jury on five larceny counts and a charge of making a false
claim to the government, the police department said.

Charged: Investigators said Joanna Leigh, 41, was at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 when two bombs exploded, , but they have argued that she was not injured

It said Leigh received $8,000 from The One Fund Boston,
which raised nearly $80 million in the aftermath of the attack. 

She also received a combined $28,700 from a middle school
fundraiser, an online campaign and the Massachusetts Victims of
Violent Crime Compensation fund, according to the police
statement.

The news comes as the trial of accused bomber, 21-year-old
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev takes place in Boston. Tsarnaev could be
sentenced to death if he is convicted.

Police said Leigh did not seek medical treatment for about
two weeks after the bombing, and when she did, she called
herself a 'hero' who ran toward the second explosion.

'At a time when most people were asking how they could help,
others were wondering how they could benefit,' Suffolk County
District Attorney Daniel Conley was quoted as saying in the
police statement.

Leigh claims the charges are punishment for criticism of The One Fund Boston over its compensation policies

Leigh, who is set to be arraigned on Monday, told the Boston
Globe newspaper that she was injured in the blast, and that the
charges were punishment for her criticizing The One Fund Boston
over its compensation policies.

'I don't think this is about me; I think this is because I
spoke out about The One Fund,' she told the Globe. 'I think this
is about killing the messenger. I went after the governor and
the mayor's charity, and I didn't shut up about it, and I caused
them trouble.'

Several others have also been charged with theft from the
fund.

In January a woman from Maine was arrested on charges of
scamming $8,000 from The One Fund, and a New York woman was
sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty last
May to fraudulently collecting $480,000 from the fund.
