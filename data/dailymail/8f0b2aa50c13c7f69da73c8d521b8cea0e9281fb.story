In another era, it would have been seen as undignified. But in the newly populist royal family, everyone seems to be getting in on the act.

After Prince Charles and the Queen set the trend by agreeing to pose for mobile phone photos with members of the public, Prince William has joined in.

And this time it was the royal who actually took the picture.

William, 31, photographed himself with Madison Lambe, 12, on her phone â€“ because she was too nervous to press the button.

The Duke of Cambridge took the snap after she visited the Sandringham Estate on Christmas Day to watch the Royal family walk from their house to church.

Madison is now the most envied pupil 
at her school after posting the image of herself standing with the 
future king on Facebook.

She
 said: 'I couldn't believe it when William came over to me and I asked 
for a picture. He just said to me 'you can't beat a good selfie on 
Christmas Day' and took the picture.

'It was really good, I didn't expect it.

'He
 was really nice and I was so excited. I've put the picture on Facebook.
 My friends think it is really good and they have been commenting on 
it.'

Madison had 
travelled with her mum Paula Scrupps, 38, from their home in Boston, 
Lincolnshire, to Sandringham on Christmas morning.

Single mum Paula, who works for tractor dealership John Deere, said: 'We got up early on Christmas morning and opened our presents and then drove down to Sandringham to show our support for the Royal family.

'Madison took some flowers for the Queen and the children line up near the church wall. 

'Parents aren't allowed to go so she asked if she could borrow my phone so she could try to a "selfie" with the Queen.

'I didn't really expect her to get any pictures but certainly didn't think she would come back with a "selfie" with William.'

Last
 month Prince Charles proved he was a good sport when an unnamed boy asked him to pose for a selfie during a visit to the Coptic Orthodox 
Church Centre in Stevenage.
