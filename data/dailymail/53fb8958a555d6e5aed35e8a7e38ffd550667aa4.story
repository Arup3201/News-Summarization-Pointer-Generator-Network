The globally renowned pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson hates Obamacare, believe marriage is reserved for one man and one woman, wants voters to reject politicians who vote to raise America's debt ceiling and says he's no 'fan of political correctness.'

When he told an overflow crowd Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference that his time at the podium was up, a chorus of 'Noooo!' erupted.

A political committee formed to draft him into the 2016 presidential race has raised more money than the much-ballyhooed 'Ready for Hillary' PAC that aims to form a nationwide organizing effort to send Hillary Clinton to the White House.

Carson is a soft-spoken anti-Obama figure. He's also the GOP's best hope at succeeding the current president with an African-American of their own.

Not what the doctor ordered: 'I miss what medicine used to be,' Carson said. 'I don't miss what it has become' under Obamacare

The group angling to persuade neurosurgeon Ben Carson to make a White House run brought activists to support him in large numbers

To Republican strategists eager to reclaim the mantle of diversity from Democrats, electing a black president with conservative values promises to turn the Obama legacy on its head and spare the party's far right wing from charges of institutional racism.

Carson, now retired after a career in surgery, told his audience that President Barack Obama has ruined the practice of medicine and brought the nation to the brink of financial disaster.

'I miss what medicine used to be,' he said. 'I don't miss what it has become.'

'We want the healthcare in our hands,' Carson said, scorning the Affordable Care Act. 'We can easily do this. We have lots of alternatives.'

Applause lines momentarily gave way to groans when he tried to put America's $17 trillion in accumulated debts into perspective.

'Do you know how long that would take to pay off at $10 million a day? 4,700 years.'

'That is absolutely absurd,' said the always-soft-spoken Carson. 'We are killing the next generation.'

On legislators who continually vote to raise America's debt limit? 'Get them out of office.'

Third rail? 'No one gets to change the definition of marriage,' Carson declared

The crowd went wild. On a less-attended weekend day at CPAC, they nearly eclipsed Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's audience in size.

Paul's audience was far louder, too. But unlike Carson's most die-hard devotees, they didn't bring campaign signs.

Evangelical Christianity plays a large role in his thinking, and in the operation of the the 'National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee.'

Carson, a professor emeritus at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, is looking like Republicans' answer to Barack Obama's first-black-president mantle

Attacking liberal commentators' accusations of rhetorical 'poison' on the political right, he mused about what they meant: 'Could it be the poison of putting what God says in front of anything man says?'

He wanted to play golf in retirement, Carson explained, but 'I think the good Lord had a different plan for me.'

'You know,' he told convention-goers, 'I still believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.'

'No one gets to change the definition of marriage.'

'Of course gay people should have the same rights as everyone else,' Carson said, wading further into one of America's most volatile political minefields, 'but they don't get extra rights.'

The draft-Carson PAC, which has already put operatives on the ground in Iowa, lists prayer – not donations – at the top of its wish list for Carson supporters.

Still, more than $2.8 million came in the doors during its first six months of activity. That's more than the 'Ready for Hillary' PAC raised in the same period.

His supporters are out in full-force at the annual CPAC event. National Journal reported Thursday that Carson's face appeared on key cards given to the first 2,000 people to check in at the convention's hotel.

But if they don't prevail, Carson told them, party unity must.

'After the primaries, if your guy doesn't win, whoever wins – you can call them a RINO or a Tea Bagger – just vote for them!' he said.
