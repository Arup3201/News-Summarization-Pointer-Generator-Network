A father who has twice been told he will die from cancer has defied the odds to get married and celebrate his daughter's first birthday.

Tommy Kirkland, 44, had survived four brain tumour operations when doctors revealed a fifth deadly brain tumour had appeared only weeks after the birth of his daughter Anna last October.

The father-of-two, from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, underwent eight hours of surgery last December as surgeons battled to remove the tumour.

Hope: Tommy Kirkland, who has twice been told he will die from cancer, has defied the odds to get married to partner Gillian (pictured) and celebrate his daughter's first birthday

Mr Kirkland, 44, had already survived four brain tumour operations when doctors revealed a fifth deadly brain tumour had appeared only weeks after the birth of his daughter Anna (pictured) last October

They also warned him that this fifth lifesaving operation would be his last chance of survival.

Miraculously, he pulled through and has now married his partner Gillian, 33, and celebrated Anna's first birthday.

Mr Kirkland said: 'My partner Gillian and I were looking forward to the birth of our second child in October last year.

'But not long after Anna was born, I was told I had another tumour.

'There is nothing I love more than my children and my wife and I knew I had to survive to see them growing up.

'When Anna was born, I was holding her and knew I'd do everything I could to be around for her for as long as possible.

'I knew I had to fight, there was just no other way around it. So I had the final operation to remove it three months later.

Under the knife: Doctors have now told Mr Kirkland that, following the removal of a fifth tumour last December (pictured), his brain is unable to take any more surgery

Despite five bouts of surgery, he remains positive, saying: 'Five tumours down and I'm still here. They are always on the left hand side of my brain. I have many problems with my left side, I'm deaf in that ear and blind in that eye'

'Then in July this year, Gillian and I decided to get married as we realised life is too short - especially when the doctors told me after this operation there was nothing they could do if I get another tumour.'

Mr Kirkland, who also has a seven-year-old son called Leo, added: 'Celebrating Anna's first birthday in October this year exactly 12 months since my diagnosis was such a special day.

'We went off to the Scottish Borders camping as a family for the occasion - I just never thought I'd see it.'

Mr Kirkland, a bar manager, was fit and healthy until he began to suffer headaches in 2006. An MRI scan revealed he had a tumour the size of a baseball in the left side of his brain.

In July this year, the couple decided to get married. Mr Kirkland said: 'We realised life is too short - especially when doctors told me after this operation there was nothing they could do if I get another tumour'

Doctors broke the news that he didn't have long to live and told him to say goodbye to his family before having an emergency operation to have it removed.

He survived and tried to get on with life, but in May 2007 he began to feel ill again and, following an MRI scan, was diagnosed with a second brain tumour, which was again successfully removed.

Then in 2009 doctors found yet another tumour. Again, Mr Kirkland was warned his chances of survival were slim because of the depth of the growth inside his brain.

He underwent a marathon 12-hour operation in March that year where his entire face was pulled down and part of his skull removed as doctors worked to remove the lump.

But he was dealt a further twist of fate when doctors found a fourth brain tumour and he was rushed back into surgery for a six-hour operation.

Even as he recovered, he fell ill again after contracting meningitis and septicaemia.

Doctors have now told him that, following the removal of a fifth tumour, his brain is unable to take any more surgery.

Determined: Mr Kirkland added: 'I owe it to my family to fight with all that I can'

Family man: Mr Kirkland said: 'Before this happened to me, I was always at the office, now I just want to be home with my kids. I'm on many different drugs now and I'm looking to the future'

Despite this, he remains positive, saying: 'Five tumours down and I'm still here. They are always on the left hand side of my brain.

'I have many problems with my left side, I'm deaf in that ear and blind in that eye.

'The moments when doctors tell you that you have to say your final goodbyes are just heartbreaking.

'But there is always hope. And I still have a life to live. People always say I'm a very positive person but I have to be.'

He added: 'I owe it to my family to fight with all that I can and just live my life as normally as I can.

'Before this happened to me, I was always at the office, now I just want to be home with my kids.

'I'm on many different drugs now and I'm looking to the future.

'I'm keeping my fingers crossed until December and hoping for 12 months clear.'
