Seventeen migrants have died in the Strait of Sicily after trying to cross the Mediterranean in an inflatable boat, the Italian navy said today.

Sailors rescued 278 migrants but found 16 others dead, and one more who died shortly after help arrived.

The dead apparently succumbed to hypothermia and dehydration in one of three boats found yesterday south of the island of Lampedusa.

And in the port of Empedocle, health workers carried out the grim task of transferring the deceased from a navy ship straight into coffins.

Some 3,200 migrants have died this year trying to reach Europe from Africa, the International Organisation for Migration has said

There were 75 survivors from the boat carrying the corpses and another 202 people were rescued from the two other inflatable boats found in the same area.

Photographs released by the navy showed standing passengers packed into the overcrowded outboard-powered boats.

Many of them are fleeing conflict and human rights abuses at home.

Italy is closing its 'Mare Nostrum' search and rescue mission which has saved some 100,000 migrants, and making way for a smaller pan-European project called Triton. 

Mare Nostrum, which included five warships on permanent patrol, was launched last October after more than 360 migrants died when their boat capsized a mile off the coast of Lampedusa.

The mission cost nearly 10million euros (£7.9m) a month, becoming a controversial strain on an economy that is suffering its third recession in six years. 

Spain's Marine Rescue service has saved 28 African migrants from an inflatable boat in waters off south-east Spain, and is searching for 23 others believed missing after the vessel ran into stormy weather.

A spokesman said the rescue took place today in the Mediterranean, 20 miles off Cabo de Gata cape.

She said the rescued migrants confirmed there had been 51 people aboard the 33ft-long boat and that many had fallen into the sea when the vessel ran into high waves and winds on Thursday.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with the service's regulations.

African migrants seeking a better life in Europe often try to reach Spain by crossing the Mediterranean Sea from Morocco in small boats.
