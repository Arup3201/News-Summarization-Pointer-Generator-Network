Celebrations: Corey Brown, 20, escaped being tagged so he can go out for his 21st birthday and over Christmas

A judge agreed not to fit a criminal with an electronic tag because of his 21st birthday plans – and that only a ‘tyrant’ would impose such a punishment.

Corey Brown had been ordered to do 150 hours of community service for his role in the theft of a pensioner’s car, but when he failed to turn up for the work sessions five times  he was hauled back into court to be given a  curfew and an electronic tag.

But he was spared after complaining that the punishment would ruin his plans for a night out on his 21st birthday.

Recorder David Hall told a stunned courtroom: ‘It would be a tyrant who tagged someone on their 21st birthday and at Christmas.’

Turning to Brown– who had sat smirking throughout the hearing at Warwick Crown Court – Recorder Hall then said: ‘If I give you seven more hours [of community service] to do, and you keep out of trouble, is that a fair deal?’

Brown, from Bedworth, Warwickshire, simply nodded, and then walked free from court.

Yesterday, victims’ groups reacted furiously to the decision, saying it would ‘undermine confidence in the criminal justice system’.

In March, Brown was given a 36-week jail sentence, suspended for two years, and 150 hours’ community service after he was caught with the keys of a Lexus that had been stolen from a  70-year-old woman.

The £30,000 car had been used in a series of raids on shops in the Coundon area of Coventry in November last year.

When police raided Brown’s home, they discovered the keys hidden in his bedpost. Brown admitted handling stolen goods.

Punishment: Corey Brown, 20, escaped with seven hours additional unpaid work after repeatedly missing probation sessions

But after failing to turn up for his 
community service placements on five occasions, on Monday he was brought
back into court – which could have seen him sent straight to prison to 
carry out his original 36-week sentence.

The court heard that Brown, who lives
with his grandmother, had also missed three sessions of a ‘Thinking 
Skills’ programme that he had been ordered to complete. Despite this, 
his lawyer asked the court to be lenient, because Brown was about to 
celebrate his birthday.

Annabel Hamilton, defending, told the
court: ‘He is very reluctant to have a curfew because of his 21st 
birthday and Christmas coming up.’

To the astonishment of court staff, 
Recorder Hall agreed to go easy on Brown, and told him he would not be 
fitted with a tag – which alerts police if offenders leave their homes 
during curfew hours.

And Brown – who has already been to prison three times – admitted that even he was surprised he had been let off.

He said: ‘I was expecting to get a 
tag for missing my probation dates. Technically, they should have 
activated my prison sentence. But the judge told me I’d done well so 
far. He said he didn’t see the point.

‘Thanks to the judge, I can enjoy a few drinks for my birthday, instead of being stuck in with my gran or in prison.’

When asked why he had not turned up 
to do his community service, he replied: ‘I don’t know; just didn’t 
think about it. I didn’t care.

‘I suppose I did see the whole thing as a bit of a joke.’

As he prepared to celebrate his 21st 
birthday yesterday, Brown added: ‘I’ve been to jail three times and I 
haven’t learned a thing.

‘I’ve already told the judge that 
jail doesn’t work for me. What’s the point of sending me to prison now?’

Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim  Support, said: ‘Tough community 
sentences can work in stopping  reoffending, but there need to be 
consequences if offenders repeatedly break them.

‘If that means disrupting a criminal’s enjoyment of the festive season, then so be it.

‘Otherwise decisions like these could undermine victims’ confidence in the justice system.’

A court insider said: ‘It was obvious the judge was feeling warm-hearted in the run-up to Christmas.

‘But it did leave the solicitors a little surprised, considering the defendant’s record.’
