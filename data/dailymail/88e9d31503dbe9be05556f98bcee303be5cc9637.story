British hope Kyle Edmund failed to take advantage of his wildcard entry when he was swept out of the Miami Open first round.

The 20-year-old from Yorkshire was beaten 6-2 6-2 in just 68 minutes by Holland's Robin Haase, the world number 98.

Edmund reached the semi-final in a strong Challenger field in Texas last week but could not replicate that form.

World number 98 Haase only needed 68 minutes to defeat Edmund 6-2, 6-2

Haase can be inconsistent but this was one of his better days and the British number three has no answers.

He may have been better off trying to come through the qualifying rather than getting a privileged entry through his management company IMG, who own the tournament.
