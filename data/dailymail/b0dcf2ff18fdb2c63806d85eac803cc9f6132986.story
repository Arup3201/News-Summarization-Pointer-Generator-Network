Hugh Hefner and Bill Cosby have been friends for years, but with more allegations coming forward every single day of woman claiming they were drugged and raped by Cosby, Hefner seems to have put his foot down.

The head of Playboy issued a statement saying, 'Bill Cosby has been a good friend for many years and the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening.

He then added, 'I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved.' 

This after a former Playboy bunny accused the embattled comedy legend of drugging and raping her - and sexually assaulting 12 other Playboy bunnies.

Fresh claims: Former Playboy bunny P.J. Masten is the latest woman to claim Bill Cosby drugged and raped her

'I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved,' said Hefner

P.J. Masten, from New Jersey, said she was in her 20s and working at Playboy's famous Chicago club in the late 1970s when she met the star, who then invited her out to lunch.

A dinner date soon followed, at the end of which, she claims she woke up naked and bruised in a bed after being drugged and attacked by Cosby, adding: 'There were bruise marks all over me. I knew I was raped.'

And in shocking claims, Masten - real name Patricia - told CNN: '(There are) 12 former bunnies that I know of that are ashamed to come forward, frightened to come forward, married with families (and) don't want to come forward. But they were also drugged and raped by Bill Cosby.'

P.J. Masten donned the famous bunny ears, tight-fitting corset and fluffy tail for her job as a waitress at the Chicago club.

She started working for Playboy in 1972 in her home state of New Jersey and went on to work in LA and Chicago for the organisation.

Coming forward: P.J. Masten say she was prompted to come forward by Judy Huth, who claims Cosby attacked her when she was 15 at the Playboy mansion

She said she first met Cosby in Chicago and he invited her to lunch, telling CNN how he jumped behind the counter to make hot dogs, saying: 'Everybody was in there laughing. It was a lot of fun.'

The next day, she said the comic called and asked her to dinner and told her to meet her at the Whitehall Hotel.

Going up to his room, she was greeted by four of his friends who were watching sports with the star, and smoking cigars and playing cards.

Cosby asked Masten if she wanted a cocktail before dinner and she drank a glass of Grand Marnier and ice he handed her. 

'The next thing I knew, it was 4 o'clock in the morning,' she told CNN: 'I woke up in a bed naked, bruised. He was laying next to me, and I slithered out of the bed... I got myself together, I went downstairs, I got in a cab, and I went home.'

Asked if she knew what had happened, Masten said: 'There were bruise marks all over me. I knew I was raped.'

Masten said she told her supervisor at the Playboy club soon after the alleged assault, only to be told: 'You know that's Hef's best friend, right?', referring to Playboy founder Hugh Hefner.

Masten recalled: 'I said, 'Yes.' She said, 'Well, nobody is going to believe you. I suggest you keep your mouth shut'.' 

The blonde said she's been in therapy for years - but said she had been prompted to come forward decades later by Judy Huth, who claims Cosby attacked her at the Playboy mansion in LA when she was just 15 in 1974.

Huth is suing the star for sexual assault - but Cosby is suing her, calling her claims 'absolutely false' and accusing her lawyer of extortion.

Victoria Valentino, a former Playboy Playmate in 1963, has come out to say Bill Cosby raped her as well.

However, Masten said: 'That was it for me. This man has to be held accountable. He's a serial rapist. He's been that way since the '60s.'

And she is convinced there are other Playboy bunnies with similar experiences of Cosby. 

She said Cosby has come up at a recent reunion of Playboy bunnies, as well as in blogs and Facebook pages restricted to them.

The public allegations stirred up lots of private conversations, involving a number of women, Masten says.

Demands: Attorney Gloria Allred is flanked by Bill Cosby accusers at her office on Wednesday, from left, Chelan Lasha, Beth Ferrier and Helen Hayes

Weeping: Chelan Lasha, now a grandmother, breaks down on Wednesday afternoon as she claims that Cosby drugged and assaulted her when she was 17

'A couple of (them) private messaged me and said, 'He did me too. It happened to me, too',' she told CNN.

Cosby, now 77, is accused of attacking 20 women, and has so far remained silent amid the myriad of claims. 

However, his lawyer Marty Singer launched legal action against Judy Huth this week, accusing her of making up claims of assault and demanding $33,295 in damages. 

In another link between Playboy and Cosby, another accuser, Carla Ferrigno, says she was an 18-year-old Playboy bunny when she went with a male friend to Cosby's Beverly Hills home in 1967 and he kissed her roughly after her date left the room.

Meanwhile, Playboy playmate Victoria Valentino says a friend introduced her to Cosby hoping to help her get work on his show I Spy in the late 1960s. She alleges he gave her pills at dinner to 'cheer up', after which she felt 'stoned' as he took her to another place. 

There, Valentino said Cosby pushed himself near her mouth, before turning her around and raping her.

Asked by CNN why she didn't speak out about the incident until recently, Valentino said, 'As a playmate, I thought, who would believe me?' 

Attorney Gloria Allred has challenged Cosby to pay $100 million in damages to the women who claim he sexually assaulted them.

The lawyer this week introduced three alleged victims - two who have never spoken before - and as they broke down in tears, she told Cosby he could waive the statute of limitations so all the women accusing him of assault could have their day in court.

If not, she said, he could stump up $100 million - and the money would be handed out to the women by a committee of retired judges. 

Speaking at her California law offices, Miss Allred said she had been forced to tell many women who had contacted her to report abuse at the hands of the comic legend that they were too late to file a lawsuit due to the statute of limitations.

However, she said: 'Today, I am here to propose two new solutions to this public dilemma and a away to determine if Bill Cosby is a saint of a sexual predator.'

She said that if Cosby is 'confident' he has done nothing wrong, he could waive the statute of limitations, adding: 'Then his alleged victims would have an opportunity to have their allegations dealt with on their merits.  

'Bill Cosby would have an opportunity to address there allegations in a court of law and the victims and Mr Cosby would have an opportunity to have a judge and jury decide who should be believed.' 

Chelan Lasha, from California - now believed to be a 46-year-old Grandmother- claimed that Cosby attacked her when she was just 17 in 1986 when she was an aspiring model. 

'I laid down,' she said: 'He laid down next to me on the bed and began pinching my left nipple and humping my leg while he was grunting.

'I could not open my eyes. I couldn't move or say anything. I felt something warm on my legs. Then I blacked out.' 

'Thirteen to sixteen hours later I woke up by hearing Mr Cosby clapping his hands and saying 'Daddy says wake up'. He gave me $1500. He said the money was to buy something nice for me and my grandmother and he also invited me to go to the Temptations show with my grandmother.

'My grandmother went but I did not go because I was too sick. Then he invited us to his show. My grandmother really want to go. I did not, but I went with her and heckled him. As a result, I was fired from my job.'  

No comment: Bill Cosby yesterday thanked Whoopi Goldberg and singer Jill Scott for their support on Twitter - but has made no public statement 

Chelan was joined by two other women, Helen Hayes, who claims Cosby fondled her breast after stalking her and her friends 'like a predator' after they met in the summer of 1973.

Beth Ferrier, meanwhile, who has already come forward, alleges that she had an affair with Cosby, which ended in him drugging and raping her - and leaving her to come to in her car in an alleyway. 

She was Jane Doe 5 in the civil suit brought against Cosby by Andrea Costand, the first woman to allege he had attacked her, in 2005. Former basketball player Andrea ended up settling out of court.
