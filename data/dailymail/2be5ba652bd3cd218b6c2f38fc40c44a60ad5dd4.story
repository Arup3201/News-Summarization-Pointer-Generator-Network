Two childhood friends have died after the car they were travelling in flipped over several times and smashed into a lamppost.

Daniel Parrinder and Michael Cox, both in their mid-twenties, were riding in a black Renault Clio in Oulton, near Leeds, West Yorkshire, last night when the car spun out of control.

The vehicle reportedly overturned a number of times and hit a lamppost, before landing on its roof in a nearby field.
