She is already regarded as one of the most stylish women in the world and now she has a new title to prove it.

Michelle Obama was praised for using fashion as a 'force for good' by the judges of the first Best Dressed List in The Sunday Times.

Experts from Style magazine said she won for her 'understanding that, as her primary role as first lady is visual, fashion can be a force for good used to inspire and entertain.'

Best dressed: Michelle Obama topped the list and was praised for using fashion as a 'force for good' 

Influential: This £55 red and white check dress from ASOS sold out quickly after she was seen wearing it

Powerful women: Queen Elizabeth II was named on the list as was Home Secretary Theresa May

Famous: May is known for her love of kitten heels and the judges said she had the 'best legs in the cabinet'

The First Lady is known for her style and the influence she wields on public trends.

She has previously made it on to People Magazine and Vanity Fair's list of best dressed women in the world.

Last
year, a white and red check dress by ASOS sold out when she appeared in
it during a visit to Davenport with husband Barrack Obama.

Politicians also featured prominently on the The Sunday Times' list, released today.

Theresa May, whose beloved kitten heels regularly hits the headlines, was named at number 11.

The judges said she has 'the best legs in the cabinet', reported The Sunday Times and was praised for wearing clothes that stand out.

Diverse styles: Tomboy Shiloh Jolie Pitt, six, won plaudits, as did 67-year-old actress Charlotte Rampling

Glamour: Helen Mirren's style won praise and she was named as 'best dressed rack'

Unusual: Grayson Perry, left, made the final 25 but Kelly Brook was given the Best Undressed title

Other high profile female politicians named include Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Pakistani ambassador to the US Sherry Rehman.

Style Magazine editor Tiffanie Darke said: 'The diverse nature of this list demonstrates the importance of fashion in the overall conversation, confirming the role clothes play in creating a visual manifesto.

'What’s so encouraging is that among the
50 people celebrated, no two share a similar look; they all occupy a 
different part of the fashion spectrum, using their own taste and 
judgement to bring together an individual style that serves to inspire.'

Worst: Lady Gaga, a lover of unusual fashion, was named Worst Dressed by the panel of judges

Actresses Tilda Swinton, Charlotte Rampling and Helen Mirren also made the final 25, as did 'Clare', the alter-ago of artists Grayson Perry.

One of the youngest to be named on the list is six-year-old Shiloh Jolie Pitt, the daughter of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, while at 86, the Queen is one of the oldest to feature on the list.

However, not everyone received a glowing report.

Kelly Brook, known for flaunting her famous curves, was named as the Best Undressed.

Lady Gaga - a lover of daring and outlandish taste - was given the Worst Dressed award.
