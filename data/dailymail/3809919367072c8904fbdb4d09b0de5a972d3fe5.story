Almost half of Britons think the right to work and live in the UK should be blocked for Romanians and Bulgarians, a survey has shown.

It comes as Downing Street confirmed it is looking at a possible extension of the length of time new arrivals from the EU have to stay in the UK before claiming benefits.

And the Romanian foreign minister urged David Cameron to reject the ‘racist attitudes’ which can dominate the political debate on immigration.

The UK government is under pressure to curb entry to the UK when EU restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians coming here to work are lifted in January

Concerns have been raised in Westminster over the numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians who might come to the UK when movement controls imposed when they joined the European Union expire in January.

But Mr Cameron’s official spokesman appeared to reject suggestions the Prime Minister was prepared to defy European courts to impose tougher conditions.

‘The Government acts within the law,’ he told reporters.

However it was confirmed that the government is considering extending the amount of time migrants have to be in the UK before they can claim benefits from three months to a year.

Mr Cameron's official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: ‘You would expect the Government to be looking at whether there is more that could be done. That process is, as you would expect, going on.’

However he refused to comment on when a decision might be made or what changes might be introduced.

Any extension of the bar on benefits would potentially set up a clash with Brussels and a row within the coalition Government.

The European Commission prevents member states from discriminating between their own citizens and those from other European Union members.

Meanwhile, an opinion poll for Channel 5 News found 47 per cent of people thought migrants from the two countries should have no right to live, work or claim benefits in the UK and 56 per cent believed immigration had resulted in a negative impact on Britain.

One in four people surveyed in the Chancel 5 News poll thought Romanians and Bulgarians should be treated the same as other EU citizens and 18 per cent thought they should have more limited rights to live, work and access welfare in the UK.

A third of people surveyed over-estimated the percentage of people born outside the UK living in the country, thinking the figure was over 40 per cent, rather than the 13 per cent indicated in the 2011 census.

More than a quarter (27 per cent) of those surveyed said Ukip had the best immigration policies, followed by Labour on 18 per cent, the Tories on 12 per cent and Lib Dems on 7 per cent.

Romania's Foreign Minister, Titus Corlatean told Channel 5 News he did not expect a ‘flood’ of migrants from his country to come to Britain after January 1 and attacked the way the immigration debate had been conducted in the UK.

He said Mr Cameron should reject ‘in clear terms if it's possible the xenophobic and populistic and once again sometimes racist attitudes which are promoted by some other British politicians’.

The Bulgarian ambassador to the UK, Konstantin Dimitrov, also accused some politicians of making ‘highly unacceptable ... prejudicial’ comments about his countrymen.

Mr Dimitrov told the Daily Telegraph that Bulgarians moving to Britain should not be described as ‘immigrants’.

‘Bulgarians are not immigrants,’ he said. ‘Bulgarians are members of the European Union and are moving freely inside the EU, including the UK.’

Although the transitional controls on freedom of movement remain in place until the end of the year, Mr Dimitrov said he had not heard of any Bulgarians being prevented from working in the UK.

He said: ‘In other words, most of all those who wanted to work here, especially since we became a member of the EU in 2007, have managed to do so.’

Occasionally, applications for accession worker cards were turned down but this was for technical reasons such as failure to provide the necessary qualifications, he told the newspaper.

:: Channel 5 News carried out an online survey of 1,006 adults from England, Scotland and Wales. Data were weighted by age, sex, region, household income, education and past vote.
