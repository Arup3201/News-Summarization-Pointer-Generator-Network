A 15-year-old boy is facing a double murder charge after he shot dead his 'controlling' parents.

Matt Liewald is alleged to have snapped after being pulled out of school and rarely allowed out of his home by his strict father.

A neighbour heard his step-mother begging 'please don't do this' before several gunshots were heard.

Matt Liewald, 15, has been charged with two counts of murder for allegedly killing his father, 43-year-old Christian Hans Liewald, and stepmom, 24-year-old Cassie Meghan Liewald, in their North Carolina bedroom

Christian Liewald, 43, and his wife Cassie Buckaloo, 24, were found dead in bed at their home in Pineville, North Carolina.

His teenage son called police to give himself up after allegedly shooting his parents as they lay in bed.

He has been charged with murder and is being held in a juvenile facility.

Family members have claimed Liewald was controlling and was too strict on his teenage son.

One theory being investigated by police is that Matt rebelled against his father's control.

Liewald, who ran an alternative school, dangled a pair of handcuffs from his car's rear view mirror and walked around the neighbourhood with a gun.

CCTV cameras were trained on the property and a 'No Trespassing' sign was tacked to the house.

Police found the couple dead in their home in early Monday morning. Liewald was reportedly a controlling father who had pulled his son from school and kept 'No Trespassing' signs and CCTV on his property

Neighbors said the family kept to themselves and Matt, who rarely came out of the house, was being home schooled after being removed from public school for fighting.

'I always hear the young guy was confined to the house. He didn't have no friends. He never smiled. I think it was soon coming,' said neighbor Alfred De'nise.

Several neighbors said Christian Liewald had clashed with them.

'He carried a gun, and it frightened some of us,' said one woman.

Another neighbor, Amy Taylor, said, 'We backed away from Christian. He is weird. A lot of us had concerns about it.'

Neighbors say the late Liewald was intimidating and carried a gun and handcuffs around the neighborhood. He reportedly rarely let his son leave the home, causing the teen to snap

Neighbor Greg Hicks said he was shot and wounded by Liewald several years ago during a dispute.  Court records show Liewald was charged in June 2007 with assault with a deadly weapon, but the charges were later dropped.

The shootings took place shortly after 2am.

Neighbour Jesse Loosemore said he and his wife heard Buckaloo's screams.

'I think we may have heard that poor lady's last words: "Oh, please don't do this".'

Police said Matt made two telephone calls to police, firstly asking police to come to his home but not giving a reason.

In a second call he admitted to shooting his parents and told them he would be waiting on a street corner near their home.
