Next time a man smiles at you be on your guard - you could be about to make yourself submissive.

Research has found that all men need to do is flash a grin at a woman and she is more likely to do what he asks.

In three experiments researchers looked at how a man’s smile impacted on a woman’s perception of him and her body language.

Men can charm women with a simple smile, researchers say. Research has found that all men need to do is flash a grin at a woman and she is more likely to do what he asks

When the man was in a dominant role - in the experiment he gave them instructions - women obeyed him more often if he grinned at them.

This was the case even if he said a blatantly sexist statement afterwards.

The study by the University of Granada in Spain also found that women assumed a more narrow and submissive posture when a man smiled at them.

The researchers concluded that the man’s ‘perceived warmth’ was the reason for the woman’s behaviour.

Women who do not want to be manipulated by a man's smile, especially when they are at work, is to know what you want before meeting men

Body language expert Patti Wood said that the findings were troubling but that it could be because women rely on body language more than men to make decisions.

She said: ‘Even if there's dissonance between what's been said and what his body is doing, women will look to the body.

‘If they see a smile, then the interaction seems more friendly.

‘It's a tricky situation, and one that highlights just how subtly sexism can intrude on interactions.

‘Even if there's dissonance between what's been said and what his body is doing, women will look to the body. 

‘If they see a smile, then the interaction seems more friendly.’

Miss Wood’s advice to women who do not want to be manipulated by a man’s smile - especially when they are at work - is to know what you want before meeting men.

She said that this will improve your body language and communication and reduce the number of nervous tics that reveal your anxieties.

Another of her tips is to watch yourself - stop avoiding eye contact and stop smiling too much yourself.

Miss Wood, who is based in the US, said: ‘Smiling can make women seem more subordinate.‘If you're smiling when giving an important statement, it makes that statement weaker.’

She also advises that women be aware of their behaviour in general and to not just look at a man’s body language.

Miss Wood said: ‘Think through the verbal message before you respond.

‘If he says something sexist and you smile or shrink, it means he can get away with it.’
