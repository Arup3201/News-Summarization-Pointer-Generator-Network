A young ballerina from Bulgaria has been killed by a hit-and-run driver after flying to the U.S. to attend a prestigious dance school.

Polina Kadiyska, 22, had been attending the Rock School for Dance in South Philadelphia, on a scholarship.

She had been walking home after having dinner at a Chinese restaurant when she was hit by a car as she crossed the street in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Tragic: Polina Kadiyska, a talented ballerina, was taken off life support Tuesday after getting critically injured in a hit-and-run over the weekend

Police say she was crossing Broad Street, in a marked crosswalk, with a green light, at approximately 4am and had the right-of-way when she was struck.

The student was taken to  Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, where she was placed on life support.

Her family, after arriving from Bulgaria, made the heart-wrenching decision to turn the machine off earlier today, as there was no hope of her making a recovery.

A post on the dance school's blog this evening reads in part: 'The Directors and Polina’s loved ones stayed at the 
hospital until her parents arrived from Bulgaria around 1:30 this 
morning.  Polina passed on a few hours later.

Promising: She had come to the Rock School of Dance on scholarship from Bulgaria about three years ago

'Our hearts and love go out to Polina and her family. She was a beautiful person in every way.'

Police have meanwhile arrested Deandre Barnes 
who is accused of running a red light, hitting three parked cars and 
fleeing the scene on foot.

Charged: Deandre Barnes, 19, ran a red light and allegedly fled the scene on foot

He was tracked down after a tip-off from waitresses when he and a friend returned to his Audi to retrieve his personal effects.

Barnes only turned 19 
on Saturday.

He now faces a litany of charges, including aggravated assault 
while driving under the influence, criminal mischief, driving while 
intoxicated, and recklessly endangering another person.

His bail is set at $1million, and he is scheduled to be arraigned April 3.

His passenger was not charged, reports Philly.com.

According to the website, Barnes was previously scheduled to appear in court on April 2 for an alleged assault that occurred last August. Court records show he is accused of threatening and attacking a female acquaintance. 

His attorney Emmett Madden, has denied guilt in both cases.

Mr Madden told Philly.com Ms Kadiyska crossed the street mid-block when she ran into Mr Barnes' lane.

After speaking to his client and other witnesses, Mr Madden assessed the hit-and-run: '[Barnes] might have gotten scared initially (and left), but he came back to make sure the girl was OK.'

Mr Madden said he had not yet read the police report; he suggested in the first case the alleged assault was fabricated by the accuser. 

Friends and loved ones are meanwhile gathering to remember Ms Kadiyska.

Graceful: One of her instructors said she was a poised and elegant dancer

Originally from Sofia, Bulgaria, she was considered a strong 
and promising dancer by her instructors and peers.

According to a Rock School spokesman, 
the young dancer began her studies at the school three years ago, and 
lived in the school's residence location at the local Marine Club her 
first year.

She had been living on her own for the part two years and had last appeared in the school’s production of
The Nutcracker as the Dew Drop Fairy in 2011.

Stephanie Wolf Spassoff, the Director at the Rock School, told ABC 7 that Ms Kadiyska had natural talent.

‘She flew! She was just beautiful in the air and she appeared effortless when she danced.’

Kind soul: Friends described her as a good mentor and a loyal friend

Laura Berry, the school's Costume 
Shop Manager, Instructor and Artistic Administrator echoed her 
sentiments in an emotional message posted on Facebook: 'She was the most beautiful girl inside and out.

'A model and ballerina. Her whole like [sic] 
was ahead of her. This was just senseless and tragic. A life ended 
without a care by the one who took it. So many are hurting right now. So
many loved her,' she wrote.

The Rock School is expected to announce a memorial in Ms Kadiyska's honour.

Flowers, cards and kind words for the family meanwhile lie on the school's 2nd floor, under a photo of the dancer piking en l'air.
