Somewhere inside Jim and Joanne Bell’s neatly kept bungalow, you might find Mrs Bell relaxing in two pairs of socks and a woolly hat.

She is wearing three knitted jumpers, sometimes a dressing gown as well, and beneath it all she is embracing a hot water bottle. In an armchair beside her is her husband, similarly dressed.

Tonight, if he’s lucky, he may also be in possession of the Bell family’s secret weapon against these unseasonably chilly evenings: Bobby, the black miniature poodle, snuggled cosily on his lap.

Wrapping up: Joanne and Jim Bell, pictured, took the drastic decision to turn off all the heating at their home in protest over rising energy costs

Saving money: For the last year the couple have not been using any heating in their home

Yes, it’s pretty darn cold here since 
the Bells turned off the heating a year ago – and it’s not going to get 
much warmer. Because for the last 12 months, through one of the 
nastiest, drawn-out winters for years, the couple have survived on the 
deliciously warm feeling they get from knowing their money is no longer 
going to a greedy, profit-obsessed energy company.

Other more elderly and vulnerable 
individuals have no choice but to turn up the gas, but in a courageously
defiant stand against spiralling bills, Mr Bell, 64, and his wife, 67, 
have sacrificed the modern day comfort of central heating for the kind 
of conditions their grannies took as the norm. And actually, they’ve 
quite come to like it.

Scared: Mrs Bell said she was afraid to put the heating on because of the frightening rise in energy bills

‘It’s really not that bad,’ Mrs Bell 
told me from the comfort of her warm outfit(s). ‘I have to laugh 
sometimes when I go into the bathroom and it’s absolutely freezing, but I
enjoy the challenge. I despise the power companies so much it soon 
cheers me up.’

Mr and Mrs Bell reckon they have saved
£800 in bills since adopting the no-heat strategy, not including the 
price hike British Gas imposed to help towards its whopping jump in 
profits. The direct debit for Bungalow Bell heating was gradually 
reduced from £60 a month, until they cancelled it altogether. The last 
letter they got from British Gas showed a balance of £98.21 in credit.

Money: Mr Bell said the couple had received a £300 rebate from British Gas on their dual fuel bill in the last 12 months

Turned off: The couple have no intention of putting the heating back on, despite the freezing temperatures this winter

Protest: The Bells said their protest of principle on behalf of hard-up families all over Britain was 'a kick in the teeth' to energy giants who had hiked their prices over the winter

According to Mrs Bell, it took a 
little while to convince her husband that abandoning central heating was
the right way to go. ‘We had a bit of a face-off,’ she said. ‘I turned 
it off, he turned it on, I turned it off. Eventually we agreed it was 
only like living in a house with no central heating, which we all used 
to do at one time. We do vie a bit over who gets the poodle in the 
evenings.’

The Bells still use electricity to 
heat the water at their home in Barnstaple, Devon, but are adamant 
they’ll never go back to central heating. ‘It’s been a bit nippy at 
times,’ Mr Bell, a retired mechanical engineer, says. ‘Yesterday it was 
freezing – minus five or six outside with the wind chill factor – but 
inside we were fine.’

The couple plan to use the money they 
save to buy some ‘slightly more glamorous’ warm clothing, as Mrs Bell 
described it; then to take their grandchildren on holiday. Where? 
‘Somewhere hot,’ said Mr Bell.
