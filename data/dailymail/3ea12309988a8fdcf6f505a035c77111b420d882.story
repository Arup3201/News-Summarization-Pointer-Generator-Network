A jilted fiancé knifed his ex-girlfriend in a frenzied attack after discovering she had met up with an old flame through Facebook.

Jealous Liam Jones, 22, was jailed for 13 years today at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court for attempting to murder Rebecca Williams just days before the couple had been due to wed.

Ms Williams, 21, had ended their four-year relationship and sent Jones a text message saying she had 'rekindled' her relationship with ex-boyfriend Gary Thompson.

Kitchen worker Jones got the largest knife he could find and drove to the house where Ms Williams was living with her parents, the court heard.

He stabbed her 10 times in the chest before slashing her throat and shouting: 'I can't let Gary have you.'

Prosecutor Paul Hobson said the couple had been due to tie the knot on June 27 last year.

He added: 'But just a month earlier, Ms Williams ended their relationship and moved back into her family home.

'Police were later called to the address after Jones came to believe that she was going to move to London after meeting someone on Facebook.

'It is plain that Jones was very upset and emotional about the end of the relationship.

'Matters came to a head when Ms Williams sent a text message to Jones telling him she had rekindled a relationship with old flame Gary Thompson and saying: "I've got my own life now."'

The court heard Jones stormed out of the kitchen where he worked at the Army's Infantry Battle School in Brecon, South Wales, and drove the 15 minutes to Ms Williams's home.

Mr Hobson said: 'She was in the garden when he arrived and he asked her questions about Mr Thompson. He was becoming more and more angry.

'He was there only for a few minutes before threatening Ms Williams, telling her: "You and Gary had better watch your backs because I'm coming for you."

'He raced home to fetch the largest kitchen knife he could find before returning to Ms Williams's home.

'All the while he was exchanging texts with her, demanding to know if she had had sex with her new boyfriend.'

The court heard Ms Williams was expecting Jones to hand over some of her belongings from their former home.

But instead he reached into the boot of his car and pulled out the carving knife.

Mr Hobson said: 'He attacked her. He was stabbing out at her to the area of the abdomen. He pushed her to the floor and tried to continue to attack her.

'He drew the blade across her neck in a wiping movement causing injury to her neck.'

Neighbours came outside to find Ms Williams lying on the floor, her body jerking as she struggled to breathe.

The court heard Jones drove off, texting friends saying: 'I've just stabbed Becky'.

Rebecca underwent life-saving surgery to repair damage to her liver and other wounds.

When Jones was arrested he told officers: 'I'm sorry I didn't mean it. If I could not have her then nobody can.'

Tom Crowther, defending, told the court that Jones's life had centred on his relationship with Ms Williams.

He told the court that Ms Williams's text messages on the day of the attack had extinguished any hope Jones had of them getting back together.

Mr Crowther said: 'He is very, very sorry for what he did on that night.'

Jones, of Brecon, admitted attempted murder.

Judge Wyn Williams told him: 'Having discovered that Rebecca Williams had taken up with another man you stabbed her in fit of jealous rage.

'One stab had penetrated her liver and the probability is that, but for medical intervention, she would have died.'
