Antioxidants, peptides and Vitamin C just don't cut it in the battle against anti-ageing anymore.

Skincare experts have taken their quest to the next step, and the latest addition to their litany of lotions and potions is literally out of this world.

Enter IOMA's Youth Booster moisturiser, a £149 face cream with a microchip in the bottle's lid that tests the hydration of your skin using the same technology NASA use in their robots on Mars.

From another planet! IOMA's £149 Youth Booster moisturiser uses the same MEMS technology to monitor skin moisture levels as robots on Mars use to measure gas levels

The microchip contains that same MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) one that in the Curiosity robot currently investigating Mars as part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission.

In the same way that Curiosity measures the gases in Mars' atmosphere, IOMA's galactic cream measures your skin's hydration levels daily.

And exclusive stockist Harrods have seen sales soar this summer because of the hot weather.

Clare Morgan, General Merchandise Manager for Beauty at Harrods said: 'Sudden hot weather can play havoc with regimented skincare regimes, and we have seen an increase in customers who seek hydrating and moisture infused products to combat sun exposure and humidity.

'The IOMA Youth Booster has performed exceptionally well over recent weeks as skincare aficionados use its incredibly advanced analysis to read skin hydration levels to ensure that the correct amount of moisturiser is applied.'

All you have to do is place the sensor on your cheek and count the number of LED lights that appear.

Moisture monitor: The cream works by measuring an monitoring your skin's moisture levels and uses LED lights to indicate how much you need to use

Up to three lights means you only need to slather on the cream once a day, but if three or more lights show, you need to apply it both morning and night to achieve your skin's required hydration level.

In time, the aim is to reach your skin's optimum hydration levels, when no more lights will show.

Aside
 from the quirky technology, the cream claims to be packed with high 
concentrations of active molecules, and aims to moisturise, regenerate, 
detoxify and protect the skin.

But
 advanced beauty comes with a hefty price tag: one tube will set you back 
£149.

Dermatologist Doctor Nadine Pomarède emphasised
 the importance of keeping skin moisturised in the hot weather: 'When 
skin is well moisturised, it functions correctly: the balance between 
the cell renewal and cell removal processes are equal, and the barrier 
function is well maintained.

'Skin plays its protective role against the external aggressions that contribute to the skin’s ageingprocess. Skin that is supple, elastic and brighter will take longer to wrinkle.

'Skin ageing is linked to environmental factors (sun, pollution, lifestyle…) as well as to its intrinsicageing. This translates in particular to a lower quality barrier function and thus decreased hydration.

'The level of moisturisation is a marker of the physiological functioning of skin. An anti-ageing skincare product's main goal is to improve skin's reparative capacities and its renewal of the epidermal cells for a higher-quality barrier function and an improved moisture level.'
