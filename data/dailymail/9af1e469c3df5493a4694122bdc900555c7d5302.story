An amateur astronomer has discovered a 170 million-year-old dying sun using a homemade telescope set up in his garden shed.

Dave Grennan, 42, from Dublin, spotted the star, thought to be 100 times the size of ours, on Good Friday using equipment he built himself.

'It was 11 o'clock at night when I actually got the first look at this and by 1am I was fairly certain and at that time of night there was nothing else for it but a strong cup of tea,' he said.

'What excites me about this one this time is the telescope - I built it myself, right down to the polishing of the lenses.'

Software developer Mr Grennan has discovered three supernovae or exploding stars over four years from a shed at the bottom of his garden.

The success rate is all the more significant as Ireland only averages six to 12 clear skies a month and the nights from May to August are too bright to hunt for the celestial phenomenon.

The latest discovery was confirmed over the weekend by the International Astronomical Union which gave it the unique name Supernova 2014as.

It was made in a galaxy which at this time of year appears beside the constellation known to most people as the Plough, or Big Dipper.

'You won't see any trace of this looking at the night sky with the naked eye, it's about 100,000 times fainter than what you can see,' Mr Grennan said.

Mr Grennan, 39, said he was about to finish up a night's stargazing when he spotted the star in the heavens over his home in Raheny, north Dublin

The international astronomy authorities have now officially confirmed Mr Grennan's discovery as a supernova

The stargazer has written a specific computer program with complex algorithms and criteria to allow his telescopes to target certain galaxies at certain times even if he is not in the shed. He then reviews hundreds of images with the naked eye.

'I don't think I could do this if I had kids, but now when I think about it maybe it would be beneficial enough if I was up half the night and bottle feeding,' Mr Grennan said.

'But one of the misconceptions is that I'm out there in the freezing cold and dark with a big coat on me looking through a telescope at the night sky - sometimes, or most of the time, when I'm looking for these things I'm inside watching the television.'

The Hubble Space Telescope was carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle in 1990

Hubble's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared

Its orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to take extremely high-resolution images with almost no background light

Hubble's Deep Field has recorded some of the most detailed visible-light images ever, allowing a deep view into space and time

The telescope is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope

Hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts

Its scientific successor, the James Webb Space Telescope is currently scheduled to be launched by Nasa in 2018.

When Mr Grennan made his second supernova discovery in 2012 he was contacted by Lomonosov Moscow State University which admitted its scientists had failed to pick up on the discovery weeks earlier.

Planets and asteroids can be named but the fleeting supernovae are registered according to the year of discovery.

They are the spectacular explosion of a star or sun like ours, caused by a violent collapse or the weight of material being pulled into its orbit.

Mr Grennan made the first discovery of a supernova from Irish soil in 2010 and two years before that he discovered an asteroid - a minor planet three metres wide - and named it after his late mother, Catherine Griffin, who encouraged his interest in the stars when he was a boy.

David Moore, head of Astronomy Ireland, said: 'He's certainly Ireland's most prolific supernova hunter.'

Despite his success in his spare time Mr Grennan has quite a way to go to top the success rate of Tom Boles, a retired telescope maker originally from Glasgow who has more than 100 discoveries to his name and an asteroid named in his honour.
