Aston Villa have made a late charge to steal MK Dons wonderkid Dele Alli from under Newcastle's noses.

It is understood Paul Lambert has launched an ambitious attempt to land the 18-year-old midfielder before Monday's transfer deadline.

As revealed by Sportsmail last week, Newcastle have made Alli a primary transfer target this month.

The Magpies have been locked in talks with MK Dons in recent days and a £5million deal - which would see Alli head back to the League One club - has now been agreed.

His proposed move to St James' Park is well advanced - though there are still various issues that need to be concluded before a deal can be finalised.

But Villa have now made their move to sign the talented teenager and remain hopeful of beating Newcastle to the punch.

However, it is understood Newcastle are firmly in the driving seat in the race to nab Alli in the next few days.
