Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made an awkward gaffe during a radio interview yesterday by confusing Britain's main political parties.

While being quizzed by Jenni Murray for Woman's Hour, Clinton suggested that the Conservatives and Tories were opponents, when in fact the two names refer to the same party.

The gaffe is particularly embarrassing for Clinton as she used to be Secretary of State, and so is expected to have extensive knowledge of foreign affairs.

Despite being a former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton managed to confuse the names of Britain's two main political parties yesterday

It is a role she will likely campaign on when it comes to the presidential race in 2016, which she is widely tipped to enter for the Democrats.

Speaking about the 'special relationship' between Britain and the US, she said: 'There's not just a common language, but a common set of values that we can fall back on.

'It doesn't matter in our country whether it's a Republican or a Democrat or frankly, in your country, whether it's a Conservative or a Tory'

Despite the stumble, Hillary appeared to be back on track while giving a similar interview half an hour later to Jeremy Vine on Radio 2, when she correctly identified Britain's two main parties as Conservative and Labour.

During the Woamn's Hour interview, Hillary also spoke about her marriage to Bill, saying that forgiving his infidelity was 'absolutely the right choice' for her - but adding that she respects women who choose not to pardon philandering husbands.

In a wide-ranging interview with BBC radio, Mrs Clinton said forgiveness is 'a choice' but that she is 'grateful every day' that it was a choice that she made.Â

'It's not by accident that the great religions, the great writers, talk about how the person who forgives is liberated maybe even more than the person who is forgiven,' she told Woman's Hour on Radio 4.

But in a sign of her commitment to politics and public office, the former secretary of state also described the moment of the U.S. commando raid to kill Osama Bin Laden as 'the most stressful 30 minutes of my life.'

But she laughed at the occasion Vladimir Putin made it clear that he would have preferred her husband's company out tagging polar bears in the Arctic, describing her relationship with Russia's president as 'fascinating'.

She said the pair had managed to find common ground in issues including wildlife trafficking but added that she had also had 'some very difficult and strong disagreements with him.'

'He is someone who is trying to move Russia backwards to regain greatness, as opposed to taking Russia, with all of its assets and talents of its people, and moving it forward,' said Mrs Clinton. 'I think that's his conflict.

'He has a tendency to want to impose his will, first on the Russian people and then on people on his borders, as we've seen on Ukraine but also on Georgia and elsewhere.

'I think you have to be strong in dealing with him, and patient.'

Hard questioning: In a wide-ranging interview with BBC radio presenter Jenni Murray, Mrs Clinton said forgiveness is 'a choice' but that she is 'grateful every day' that it was a choice that she made

Widely expected to make a second bid 
for the president in 2016, Mrs Clinton appeared on Woman's Hour to talk 
about her new book, Hard Choices, an account of her four years as 
America's top diplomat.

But 
with Monica Lewinsky also in London this week, presenter Jenni Murray 
pressed her on personal issues that went far beyond her role in the 
Obama administration.

Mrs 
Clinton initially tried to dodge a probing question about how her 
perception of Ms Lewinsky, the former White House intern with whom Mr 
Clinton admitted having had an 'inappropriate relationship'.

'That's
 something that we have certainly moved beyond and our country have 
moved beyond,' said Mrs Clinton, before changing tack to talk about the 
U.S.'s economic problems.

But pressed by Murray to explain what it is about her husband that allowed her to forgive him, Mrs Clinton said: 'Forgiveness is a choice and I fully respect those who don't make that choice, for whatever reason.

'But for me it was absolutely the right choice. And it is something that is incredibly difficult but I am grateful every day that that's the choice that I've made.

'I have counselled others to see if, in their own hearts, they can also do that. If they can't fine, but even if they do and then choose a different path, fine as well.' Her comments came after Ms Lewinsky was this week seen mingling with royalty and stars at high-profile parties in London.

The 40-year-old has broken cover after nearly a decade of keeping a low profile with an article in Vanity Fair and an appearance in a forthcoming National Geographic documentary on the 1990s in which she calls herself 'the most humiliated woman in the world.

Moving on: Monica Lewinsky has made a decision to stop laying low and 'It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress'

Sitting pretty: Lewinsky says she decided to 'stick her head above the parapet' and come out of her self-imposed exile

But while Ms Lewinsky's role in one of the greatest sex scandals of recent times has overshadowed much of her life, Mrs Clinton has gone from strength to strength as a top official of the world's most powerful nation.

Mrs Clinton spoke about one of the most dramatic moments in that career today, when she explained the situation behind the famous photo of her and others in Obama's cabinet as they watched the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, which is included in her book.

It famously shows her with her hand over her mouth.

'I was not conscious of what I was doing, I was just reacting in a very visceral way because it was the most stressful and intense 30 minutes-plus of my entire life,' she told Woman's Hour.

Stressful: Mrs Clinton explained the story of that famous photo of her and her colleagues in Obama's cabinet as they watched the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, which is included in her book

She explains how she was the official who had recommended to President Obama that he order the mission, but she was nevertheless concerned that things could go wrong. It appeared her fears had been realised when the tail of one of the SEAL team's helicopters clipped a building as it came in to land, disabling it.

'We'd planned for it but still you hold your breath when it's going on,' she said.

Sales of Mrs Clinton's book have so far been well short of expectations, reaching just 160,000 in its first week.

By comparison Clinton's book Living History sold 600,000 copies in a single week when it was released in 2003, leading publishing group Simon & Schuster to believe Hard Choices would be a hit.

But sales of the book continue to plummet, and it looks increasingly unlikely bookstores will be able to sell the million hard copies the publishing group distributed to them when the book dropped earlier this month.
