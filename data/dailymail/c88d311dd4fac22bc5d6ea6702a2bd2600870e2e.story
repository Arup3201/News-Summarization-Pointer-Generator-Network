A college fraternity house has been suspended after members used their Facebook page to organise drug deals and post pictures of topless teenage girls.

Members of Florida International University's Pi Kappa Alpha house could now be facing a police investigation after using the social network to request 'coke' and sell weed cookies and the prescription drug Adderall.

They also used Facebook to share photographs of topless girls, one of which was described as being of a 17-year-old.

Florida International University has been forced to suspend its Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity after members appeared to organise drug deals and post pictures of topless teenage girls on Facebook

But the university has been forced to suspend the fraternity after screenshots of the posts were leaked to the Miami Herald and Miami New Times newspapers.

A college spokesman said in a statement: 'The university is taking this information very seriously because it suggests possible Student Code of Conduct violations.

'The university took prompt action and 
placed the fraternity on interim suspension pending the outcome of 
investigations by appropriate university departments, including the 
police.

'As a result, the fraternity has been instructed to cease all 
meetings and events.'

Brazen: One of the posts on the fraternity's Facebook page requested a 'connect for coke'

A post written alongside a photograph of a topless girl lying on a bed suggested she was 17 at the time it was taken

Another photograph of a topless woman posted on the PIKE Facebook page which has now been deleted

The drug dealing posts became so commonplace on the Facebook page that members began reffering to the fraternity as the 'Pike Pharmacy'.

Drugs were reporetedly being procured for not only to their own members but to the university community at large.

Another photo appears to show Pike members placing a pig's head on the door knob of a rival frat house who are also described as 'faggots'.

Alongside one photograph of a topless 
girl lying on a bed was the caption 'for those of you who haven't seen 
****'s tits'. Another comment posted alongside the picture read: "i 
think she was 17 at the time of the titi pics LOL.'

Among the blatant drug deal posts was one that read: 'Anyone have a connect for coke. Not me, a friend wants, lol.'

'Study aid': In this post the prescription drug Adderal appears to being being offered

And in another the prescription stimulant Adderall, often abused by college students as a study aid, is advertised: '30mg of addy 10 starting tomorrow. 15 for non brothers.'

The fraternity has now deleted the Facebook page.

Pi Kappa Alpha's national organization told the New Times: 'The International Fraternity had no previous knowledge of this Facebook group and was informed of its existence on Tuesday, August 20, 2013.

'The International Fraternity has been assured of the chapter's full compliance with the temporary suspension and subsequent investigation.'
