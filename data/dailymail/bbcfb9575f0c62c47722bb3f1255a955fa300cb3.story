The iPhone is 'falling behind' on features, according to one of Apple's key founders.

Steve Wozniak - known as Woz - founded the giant Californian firm with Steve Jobs in 1976.

And although it's 35 years since the other Steve parted company with Apple, people still sit up and listen when he speaks out about the company and its products.

Outspoken Steve Wozniak still prefers to queue up for a new Apple product at a local store, and camped overnight to buy the iPhone 4 when it launched

Speaking to Wirtschafts Woche, a German website, Mr Wozniak said that the iPhone is 'somewhat behind with features in the smartphone business.

'Others have caught up. Samsung is a big competitor. But precisely because they are currently making great products.'

This is not the first time that Mr Wozniak has spoken out about Apple.

Last year he told technology website Techcrunch: 'Apple was just used to cranking out the newest iPhone and falling a little behind and that worries me greatly.

'It worries me because I love Apple.

'It worries me if Apple were to lose ground because they were making the same things they know how to make. 

'Improving is not Apple-style innovation.'

And in a move that shocked die-hard Apple fans, he praised Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system: 'Just for looks and beauty, I definitely favour the Windows 7 phone over Android.

'I'm kind of shocked on every screen — much more beautiful than the same apps on Android and iPhone.'

Steve Wozniak (pictured right) first met Steve Jobs (left) in 1970, and the pair founded Apple in 1976 and shortly after that launched the Apple I.

That was followed by the Apple II computer, which established the company founded in a California garage as a major player on the fledgling computer scene.

Mr Wozniak was seriously injured in a plane crash in 1981 when the aircraft he was piloting crashed on take-off. H

He spent two years making a slow recovery, and left Apple officially in 1987.

Since then he's gone on to be a noted champion of technology start-ups.

Mr Wozniak is also a well-known philanthropist, with his projects including financing the technology programme in his local school district.

He's also been an occasional thorn in the side of the company he co-founded, making outspoken attacks on Apple's launch of its mapping app and Siri.

Mr Wozniak also shocked observers last year when he praised Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system, saying he favoured it over phones using Google's Android operating system.

However, he did go on to say that the iPhone is still his favourite handset.

But in a cheeky sting in the tail, he also said that he thought 'Steve Jobs might have been reincarnated at MS due to a lot of what I see and feel with this phone making me think of a lot of great Apple things'.

Mr Wozniak also spoke out about the Maps fiasco that erupted when the iPhone 5 was launched. Apple had dropped Google Maps in favour of its own mapping app, which turned out to be a disaster when it was revealed to be inaccurate and badly executed.

Disappointed users were all over the web saying how angry they were, and sharing screenshots that showed missing roads, missing buildings - Milan's Duomo cathedral was nowhere to be seen on Apple's map of the Italian city.

Mr Wozniak agreed, telling a conference in Australia: 'I tried to navigate somewhere, and I couldn't get to where I wanted to by voice.

'So, I was a little disappointed, because I love navigation by voice with my Google [Android] phones, actually, since they always get it and are based on a better database.'

It was such a fiasco that Apple subsequently sacked Scott Forstall, the executive in charge of its mapping app.

Maps hasn't been Mr Wozniak's only target.

Earlier last year he had also expressed his disappointment with Siri, the iPhone's virtual personal assistant.

He said that he had been a fan of Siri, but that it had got worse since Apple had bought it.

He told a reporter that Siri had impressed him when he asked it how many prime numbers greater than 87 there are.

When Siri answered the question correctly, Wozniak enthused: 'It's incredible. It's like it understands "greater than".'

But he said that since Apple had bought Siri, 'A lot of people say Siri. I say poo-poo,' he said.

Mr Wozniak is not alone is criticising Apple for a lack of innovation.

Since the death of Steve Jobs in October 2011, many have felt that the Californian giant - which has a cash pile of $137 billion (£87 billion), only £3.7m smaller than the entire economic output of New Zealand - is falling behind.

Analyst Trip Chowdry at Global Equities Research said in November: 'Apple's innovation is sputtering. 

'Why is that Apple, the company that brought touch to phones and tablets, stopped just there and did not bring touch to notebooks and iMacs? 

Steve Wozniak (left) and Steve Jobs (right) founded Apple in a garage in California and went on to launch first the Apple I and then the Apple II computers, which helped established computers in the mainstream

'Why is it that Apple brought high-resolution screens to some Mac MacBooks and not to all devices?'

The company's ongoing battle with Samsung has turned off both fans and investors, while lacklustre product launches such as the iPad Mini have sparked suggestions that the Californian company has lost its way since the death of Steve Jobs.

Apple's quarterly results, announced at the end of last month, disappointed investors.

Although the figures were very good by any other business's standards (revenues were up 18 per cent on the previous quarter) flat profits led to a sense of unease about Apple languishing on innovation.The company's shares fell 11 per cent the day those results were announced and have yet to make a significant recovery.
