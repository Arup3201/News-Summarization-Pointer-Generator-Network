While Mosman boasts the most expensive street, the suburbs itself ranked 11th on the top list of suburbs with 99.87 percent of houses in the millionaire's club.

John Edwards, a consulting analyst for onthehouse.com.au said it was no surprise to see so many NSW suburbs housing some of Australia’s most expensive properties.

'Within the top 10 alone, no suburb drops below 99 percent, and while Mosman didn’t make the top 10, the fact it hosts Australia’s number one street still cements its position as one of Australia’s most prosperous localities,' he said.

Balgowlah Heights, Clontarf, Cremorne Point, Duffys Forest, Henley, Huntleys Point and Huntleys Cove are the most expensive NSW suburbs with 99.99 percent of homes being valued over $1 million.
