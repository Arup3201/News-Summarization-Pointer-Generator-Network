A Connecticut woman was arrested - and her pet monkey confiscated - after authorities say the animal scratched the woman's 10-year-old daughter last week.

Mariantonia Morales has been charged with risk of injury to a minor and owning an exotic pet after her pet marmoset monkey, Aladdin, accidentally scratched her daughter Samantha on the face.

Authorities in Waterbury, Connecticut, say the 10-year-old girl was home from school on a snow day last week when she took Aladdin out of his cage to play with him.

Therapy: Mariantonia Morales got the monkey to help her recover from a recent cancer diagnosis

The monkey, the girl says, was reaching for a hair clip she was wearing and accidentally scratched her on the forehead.

When Samantha returned to school, someone asked her how she injured her forehead. When she told the injury was from her mother's monkey, the school alerted police and called the state's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to report that a monkey had injured a young girl.

Morales, who says she brought the monkey from her home in South Carolina as she recovered from surgery and complications after being diagnosed with cancer, was forced to turn the monkey over to DEEP officials.

'I felt that I was being bullied,' Morales told NBC. 'I'm worried, and I'm 
heartbroken because they don't care that he's a part of the family. They
 just think it's just a monkey. But it's not just a monkey. For me, it's
 not just a monkey.'

Connecticut has a troubled history with privately owned monkeys, which has led state lawmakers to outlaw owning primates that weigh more than 50 pounds. According to DEEP, owning marmoset monkeys like Aladdin is prohibited in Connecticut.

Connecticut's monkey laws are the result of the brutal 2009 attack of Charla Nash by a chimpanzee called Travis.

Travis had been on Connecticut authorities' radar since he led officers on a chase through Stamford in 2004.

Five years later, Travis - who belonged to Nash's friend Sandra Herold - attacked Nash, mauling the 55-year-old woman's face and arms.

By the end of the attack - described by hospital officials as 'horrendous' - Nash had lost her hands, nose, eyes, lips, mid-face bone structure, and received significant brain tissue injuries.

Nash has since undergone facial transplant surgery, but the wounds from the attack are still very visible.

Following the attack on Nash, Connecticut has put laws in place prohibiting exotic, in many cases dangerous pets.

'Working with DEEP, we determined that it's illegal to have that type of 
animal in the house,' Waterbury Deputy Police Chief Chris Corbett told the station.

Authorities say that regardless of where Morales got the monkey, she is still required to abide by the laws of the state that she is in.

'Based on that, the mother was charged with risk of injury to a minor. 
One, because she shouldn't have had that animal in the house with the 
child and two, because she didn't seek medical treatment for the child,' Corbett continued.

However, NBC Connecticut says it has seen documentation from the hospital that lists the girl's injury as an 'abrasion,' not a bite. The station also says it has seen documentation proving that the monkey is currently up-to-date on all of its vaccines.

'I thought in my mind, as a mother, you get a scratch, what do you do? 
You put some Bacitracin on it and call it a day. She wasn't bit,' Morales says.

Morales says she hopes the charges against her will be dropped and she will have her beloved monkey returned to her.

'I just want him home. I have a six-month lease here. In May, if this is
 gonna be an outcome, I'm out, I can't be here,' she said.

It seems unlikely Morales will be successful in her attempts to get Aladdin back - DEEP says the monkey has been taken to a zoo in Bridgeport. If the animal is healthy, he will be placed at another zoo or educational facility.
