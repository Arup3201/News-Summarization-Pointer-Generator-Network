A row has broken out between academics at two Oxford University colleges after a professor said a planned student accommodation block would spoil the views from his rooms.

Jonathan Bate, provost of Worcester College and world-renowned Shakespeare expert, has complained that Exeter College's building would be 'overbearing, out of scale and out of character', and would 'obliterate' views from his rooms.

However the Rector of Exeter College, Frances Cairncross, has hit back at Professor Bate, saying the accommodation is desperately needed for less well-off students and adding: 'We do not feel that colleges should go out of their way to deprive undergraduates of affordable accommodation.'

The spat began when Prof. Bate sent an email to his students suggesting they oppose Exeter College's plans to build a four-storey block on the former Ruskin College site that would house 90 students.

Prof. Bate, a governor of the Royal Shakespeare Company and board member of Princeton University Press, says he, as well as students, Fellows and staff were 'horrified' at Exeter's plans for 'the sensitive western end' of the proposed building that was far too high.

He told MailOnline he that his email suggesting students lodge online protests to Exeter's plans was in response to a query from his college's Junior Common Room asking how and on what grounds they might object.

The professor's email criticised the 'excessive elevation of the proposed building at the end of the site that overlooks the orchard and our accommodation, and the inappropriately garish and intrusive materials proposed for its roof and upper level', according to the Oxford Student.

He said if the undergraduates complained,it would 'help us to reduce the level of intrusiveness upon the College - something for which thousands of students in future generations will thank you.'

Representatives from Worcester College took part in talks before the planning process began but no agreement was reached.  There were two public consultations and a third especially for Worcester, as well as several meetings with Prof. Bate which resulted in Exeter agreeing to lower the roof line and use different cladding materials.

However the academic is still unhappy with the plans that Exeter submitted to Oxford City Council 10 days ago.

Worcester College's orchards are more than 700 years old and Professor Bate says they will be overshadowed

Needs more space: Historic Exeter College is short of rooms for undergraduates in the city centre

Prof Bate, 54, whose Grade I-listed lodgings are set in 26 acres of Grade II-listed grounds with a lake, objected to the fact that the new building would overlook Worcester's 700-year-old orchard.

And he is also concerned that views from his lodgings towards the eighteenth century Radcliffe astronomical observatory would be ruined, according to the Daily Telegraph.

He told MailOnline: 'What we want Exeter to do is step down the end of the building, to bring its height into line with our building next door and to avoid overshadowing the historic orchard so much.

'This would require them to reposition eight student rooms on the lower level elevation facing the road, so they wouldn’t actually lose any accommodation.'

But Exeter's Ms Cairncross said that her historic college had the worst student accommodation in the city and urgently needed more rooms for undergraduates who could not afford to rent privately.

She told MailOnline: 'We have already reduced the height to meet Worcester’s concerns.

'Any further reduction will mean the loss of 14 student rooms – and that means 14 of our students each year will have to rent on the very expensive private market in Oxford instead of having subsidised College accommodation.

'The rooms are “mini-bursaries” and we need them to reassure families who are not well off that they can afford to send their children to Oxford. That is why they matter so much.'

She added: 'We have been on our very constrained site since 1315 and are desperately short of student housing, especially for our third years.'

Economist Ms Cairncross said Exeter had 147 student rooms on its city centre site and 320 undergraduates, with further housing on the Iffley Road, an arterial road leading out of the city.

Students at Exeter College have come out in support of their rector and her plans.

Edward Nickell, president of Exeter's Junior Common Room, said: 'Never mind a b***** college orchard, 2nd and 3rd year Exonians don't even get rooms!

'Worcester have ducks and lakes, while at Exeter we're bottom in Oxford for living costs satisfaction.'
