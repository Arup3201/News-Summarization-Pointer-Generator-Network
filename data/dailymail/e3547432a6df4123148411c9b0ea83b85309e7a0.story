New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft is backtracking on his story that Russian President Vladimir Putin stole his Super Bowl Ring.

A spokesman for the billionaire businessman on Sunday said Kraft's claim that Putin pocketed his $25,000 Super Bowl XXXIX ring was a 'humorous, anecdotal story that Robert retells for laughs.'

A careful reading of the statement, though, reveals that Kraft isn't saying the story is untrue - only that it isn't meant to be taken seriously.

Kraft said Thursday that after Putin 
made off with his ring, he was pressured by the Bush White House into 
calling it a gift was a gift and letting Putin keep it.

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has claimed that Vladimir Putin took his Super Bowl ring and that the White House told him to say it was a gift

On Sunday, Kraft's spokesman said: 
'(Kraft) loves that his ring is at the Kremlin, and, as he stated back 
in 2005, he continues to have great respect for Russia and the 
leadership of President Putin.'

It's a good thing, too. Because Putin isn't giving it back.

Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN  the ring resides at the Kremlin museum - where all 'state gifts' are kept.

He denied that Putin stole the ring -
 insisting that Kraft freely gave it to the Russian leader in 2005 at a 
meeting in Saint Petersburg.

'What Mr. Kraft is saying now is 
weird. I was standing 20 centimeters away from him and Mr. Putin and saw
 and heard how Mr. Kraft gave this ring as a gift,' he told the network.

According to the New York Post, Kraft
 told an audience at a gala in New York on Thursday that he handed Putin
 the ring when the Russian president asked to look at it.

On Sunday, Stacey James, a spokesperson for Robert Kraft's company, the Kraft Group issued a statement backtracking on the story Kraft told Thursday:

'It's a humorous, anecdotal story that Robert retells for laughs.

'He loves that his ring is at the Kremlin, and, as he stated back in 2005, he continues to have great respect for Russia and the leadership of President Putin.

'In particular, he credits President Putin for modernizing the Russian economy.'

The statement adds that the ring being at the Kremlin has 'an added benefit from the attention this story gathered eight years ago was the creation of some Patriots fan clubs in Russia.'

‘I took out the ring and showed it to
 [Putin], and he put it on and he goes, “I can kill someone with this 
ring,”’  Kraft told the crowd.

Kraft continued: ‘I put my hand out and he put it in his pocket, and three KGB guys got around him and walked out.’

The incident occurred in 2005, the summer after the Patriots had won their third Super Bowl under his Kraft's ownership.

He was one of a number of prominent American businessmen who visited Russia to meet with Putin. 

At the time, Kraft released a public statement saying the 
diamond-encrusted ring - worth more than  $25,000 - had been a gift.

'President Putin, a great and knowledgeable sports fan, was clearly taken
 with its uniqueness. I decided to give him the ring as a symbol of the 
respect and admiration that I have for the Russian people and [his] 
leadership,' read Kraft's statement at the time.

But now 
Kraft has claimed that Putin simply pocketed the 4.94-carat ring and that the White House intervened when he 
demanded it back, reports the

According to Kraft he received a call from the George W. Bush-run White House, saying, 'It would really be in the best interest of US-Soviet relations if you meant to give the ring as a present.'

But, Kraft said, 'I really didn’t [want to]. I had an emotional tie to the ring, it has my name on it. I don’t want to see it on eBay. There was a pause on the other end of the line, and the voice repeated, "It would really be in the best interest if you meant to give the ring as a present.’”

The ring is reportedly kept in the Kremlin library.
