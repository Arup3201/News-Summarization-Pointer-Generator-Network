Barack Obama and White House challenger Mitt Romney are on track to raise more than $2 billion by Election Day – making it by far the most costly presidential race in history.

By November 6, both candidates will have each passed the $1 billion barrier in donations.

Mr Obama is already there, according to financial disclosures filed yesterday. The president and his Democrat Party have tallied up about $1.06 billion while Mr Romney and the Republicans have collected $954 million since the turn of the year.

Big business: President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney have brought in about $1.7billion so far this election, according to fundraising reports

By comparison, Mr Obama raised a total
 of $750 for his successful 2008 campaign and his opponent, John McCain,
 raised just (pounds) $130 million, which included a government grant 
for more than two-thirds of the total.

The sources of the money underline the difference between the two rivals and the kind of support they are attracting.

Wall Street has invested more heavily 
in Mr Romney than any White House candidate in memory, according to the 
New York Times, which obtained the disclosures last night. Employees of 
financial firms have given more than $18 million to the ex-financier’s 
campaign.

They have also donated hundreds of 
millions more to so-called ‘super PACS’ – groups working independently 
of the official campaigns that often provide cash for adverts backing 
their chosen candidates. The super PAC cash is not included in the 
campaign totals.

Doctors, insurance companies, 
accounting and property firms are all turning more to the Republican 
hopeful than they did four years ago.

Mr Obama has set his sights more on 
Silicon Valley and it has clearly paid off with technology executives 
donating $14 million to his coffers, much more than last time around.

Retirees - the biggest source of 
money for both sides – as well of employees of retailers, hospitals, 
nursing homes and women’s groups have all sided in bigger numbers with 
the Democrat incumbent.

Like in 2008, the vast majority of Mr 
Obama’s money came in small donations – 55 per cent of his donations 
came in amounts of less than $200. Just 13 per cent of his cheques were 
for $2,500, the maximum amount donors are allowed to give as individuals

Golden handshakes: With the 2012 election so tight, both Obama and Romney have spent considerable time at high-dollar fundraising events courting wealthy donors

Touch down: This year marked the first time that both
 major party candidates opted out from the public financing system 
established to set limits on how much a presidential candidate can raise

Delray Beach, Florida: In 2008, Obama became the first presidential contender to refuse all public financing while his Republican rival, Arizona Sen. John McCain, accepted the government funds

The Obama campaign has received donations from 4.2 million people, about a million more than in 2008.

By contrast, Mr Romney has profited 
from support from big business donors. Just 22 per cent of his cash came
 from people donating less than $200 while 45 per cent was for the 
$2,500 maximum.

Of the super PACS, Mr Romney was by 
far the biggest winner. Groups aligned with Mr Romney have spent $302 
million on campaign advertising, compared with about $120 million for 
groups supporting Mr Obama.

The final countdown: The close race between Obama and Romney and the sharply polarized electorate have also played a role in accelerating the dash for dollars

Wrapping up a 40-hour battleground 
state blitz yesterday, Mr Obama headed to his hometown of Chicago and 
cast his ballot 12 days before Election Day.

The stopover was more than a photo 
opportunity — it was a high-profile attempt to boost turnout in early 
voting, a centerpiece of the president's strategy

Tough talk: (In Richmond, Virginia) Obama's spokesman said the President's campaign was making efforts to expand its donor base as it headed into the remaining days before the election

Star help: Both candidates have enlisted the help of celebrities. Romney's got Meatloaf (performing alongside Romney in Defiance, Ohio), for example, while Obama has Katy Perry, right (in Las Vegas on behalf of the president)

Portsmouth, Ohio: Obama's campaign team admitted that Romney and his supportive super PACs were outspending the president on the airwaves

Michael Toner, a Republican campaign finance lawyer and former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, said the close race between Obama and Romney and the sharply polarized electorate have also played a role in accelerating the dash for dollars.

'I don't know any campaign manager who thinks they have too much money. In this political 50-50 environment you can't ever have enough,' Toner said. 'Every last million could make the difference in who is elected.'

But the emergence of super PACs and other outside groups, emboldened partly by the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court in 2010, has done more than anything else to reshape the contours of presidential campaign fundraising.

The wheels on the bus: Romney arrives in Worthington, Ohio. A handful of federal court cases have broadly eased campaign finance regulations, allowing donors to give unlimited sums

A handful of federal court cases have broadly eased campaign finance regulations, allowing donors to give unlimited sums. That kind of money has largely been funneled to super PACs, which can raise and spend money on behalf of candidates as long as they don't coordinate expenditures or strategy with the campaign.

'The distinctive factor in this election is the outside money being spent and the corrupting money financing it,' said Fred Wertheimer, a longtime campaign finance reform advocate. 'It's a symbol of the disastrous campaign finance system we have and the undue influence relatively few well-financed individuals and interest groups now have over government decisions.

Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson is the top super PAC donor this year. Adelson, a billionaire, has contributed more than $40 million to Republican super PACs, including those backing Romney and former candidate and House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
