Stella McCartney was slammed for her Team GB kit, which featured a blue and white Union flag - effectively eliminating the St George and St Patrick crosses from the design.

And now high street chain Next has stuck its head above the parapet, unveiling its collection of formal wear, which will be worn by more than 1,000 Olympians and Paralympians at the July 27 Opening Ceremony, at sponsorship events and at an official meeting with the Queen.

The range, which is entirely navy-blue, bar touches of gold detailing, includes tailored jackets, cowl-neck dresses, lace-up shoes for men and sensible courts for women.

Next has unveiled its range of formalwear as modelled by British Olympic athletes

British Olympians will receive the smart attire, which has been created in some 66 different sizes, along with their competition kit at ceremony held at Loughborough University.

The induction areas are to be branded the Next Room (ceremonies and formalwear) followed by the Adidas Room (training, competition, presentation and village uniforms).

Next will also be providing uniforms for 4,500 technical officials and suits for organisers as part of the sponsorship deal which CEO Simon Wolfson told Bloomberg cost 'a few million pounds'.

'This is a high quality suit that will see a life much more beyond the Olympics,' rower Andy Triggs Hodge said of the outfit which was made from wool woven in Yorkshire but manufactured in China due to cost pressures.

A spokesperson from the retailer said: 'Everyone at Next is thrilled to be playing a very special part in the London 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.

'As the official clothing and homeware supplier to the eagerly anticipated London 2012 Games, this is a unique opportunity to showcase our attention to style, detail and innovation.'

Men’s jackets, fashioned from milled cloth, are styled with peak lapels and 
double angle-darting to ensure the perfect fit.

The underside of each collar is embroidered with the team motto 'Better Never Stops' for 
Olympians, and 'Talent, Pride, Determination' for Paralympians.

And not forgetting the Union flag each of the women's cowl-neck dresses features a laser-cut 
decoration on the bodice.

A replica of the men's Team GB suit will go on sale at 31 Next stores priced at £220, however the dresses to be worn by the country’s female 
competitors couldn’t be produced cheaply 
enough to go on sale

The replica clutch bag will be available in Next stores from mid June, priced at £25

Next, will start selling replica men's navy suits with a gold handkerchief from May 19 at 31 of its 500-plus U.K. stores.

The official Team GB logo and badges 
will be removed from the £220 version and the navy tie to be worn by 
British Olympians isn’t for sale, designer Michael Woodhouse revealed.

The dresses to be worn by the country’s female 
competitors also won’t be available to the public as it couldn’t be produced cheaply 
enough for sale to Next customers.

Instead, casual-wear such as London 2012 t-shirts depicting 
Olympic mascot Wenlock have gone on sale for £12 while a bag emblazoned with the national flag, will retail for £25.

Chief Executive Officer Simon Wolfson told Bloomberg that the sponsorship is about 'promoting the brand and particularly now we’re developing an international business.

'I don’t think we’ll see any overnight or instant impact from the Olympics.'

The retailer follows fellow British brands Ben Sherman, Lee Cooper and M&S in designing formal wear kits for Team GB.

Giorgio Armani has designed formal wear kits for the Italian Olympic team, while Ralph Lauren will be dressing U.S. athletes for official occasions.
