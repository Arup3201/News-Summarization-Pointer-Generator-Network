The Ghostbuster's iconic headquarters, a firehouse located in New York City's Tribeca neighborhood, has been valued at nearly $16million.

According to the Movoto Real Estate blog’s fictional property evaluations, the movie's 9,642.55square-foot firehouse would be worth 'at least $15,717,356.50' in today's market.

Its fictional size and real life location at 14 North Moore Street, as well as how much comparable properties in the Tribeca area cost today, were all taken into account.

Seen today: According to the Movoto Real Estate blog¿s fictional property evaluations, the movie's 9,642.55square-foot firehouse would be worth 'at least $15,717,356.50' in today's market

In the movie, the Ghostbuster's firehouse is set up inside an abandoned three-story firehouse in Manhattan.

In real life, it is two entirely different firehouses. The interior is the Los Angeles Station Company 23 firehouse.

Meanwhile the exterior is the still-in-operation Hook and Ladder number eight firehouse in Manhattan.

'For the basis of my evaluation, I went with the film’s location for the firehouse - the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan,' wrote Randy Nelson, Movoto Real Estate's content editor.

In the film, the firehouse contains at least nine rooms: a reception, office, basement, ghost containment area, kitchen, dining room, laboratory, sleeping quarters and a bathroom.

Mr Nelson explains: 'Early in the movie, there’s a scene where a real estate agent is showing the team around the iconic location.

'The real estate agents says: "Besides this, you’ve got another substantial work area on the ground floor, office space, sleeping quarters and showers on the next floor, and you have your full kitchen on the top level. It’s 10,000 square feet total."'

But the movie's character Egon Spengler quickly replies: 'It’s 9,642.55 square feet'.

Mr Nelson tracked down several houses close to the firehouse in the same square footage range and ended up with a cost per square foot of $1,630 on average.

'I multiplied the square footage (9,642.55) by the cost per square foot ($1,630) to end up with a final price of $15,717,356.50,' he wrote.

It was 29 years ago that the firehouse was found by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson in a state of disrepair.

Because the evaluations are based on current-day market prices, it it not known how much the building would have cost in 1984.
