Secluded: Odzhan Naumkin, 20, has spent his entire life living in a hut in a forest with his parents

A Siberian 'Mowgli' turned down a chance to eat at McDonald's during his first visit to the city and instead opted to visit an art gallery. 

Odzhan Naumkin, 20, has spent his entire life living in a hut in a forest with his parents.

But a few weeks ago he emerged from the Altai wilderness and announced that he plans to try for a place at university even though he has only been schooled by his parents.

A Russian newspaper decided to show Mr Naumkin the life that his parents had decided against many years before and took him to Moscow.

When he was asked if he wanted to eat at McDonald's he declined the offer and instead asked to visit Tretyakov Gallery as his dream is to become an artist, reported the Siberian Times.

Despite
 almost no contact with other humans expect the occasional passing 
hunter, Mr Naumkin did not appear too phased by his visit to the 
bustling city. 

'It is Odzhan's first time in the 
city, but he holds himself up very well and speaks confidently, 
demonstrating a wide scope of knowledge in art and history,' reported 
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.

'Anyone would find it hard to believe that he was never taught by a formal school.'

After
 years of living alone with his parents Alexander and Elena, Mr Naumkin 
now wants to study at university, although he has never attended school 
during his time living alone in the Altai region, 250km south of the 
city of Barnaul. 

His 
father an artist sold mushrooms they gathered, as well as his paintings.
 But Mr Naumkin and his mother had extremely limited contact with the 
outside world.

New life: A few weeks ago he emerged from the Altai wilderness and announced that he planned to get a place at university, even though he has only been schooled by his parents Alexander and Elena

His father said: 'I don't think that 
the fact that he skipped the school was a disadvantage for him. Our 
school programmes were far better than modern ones. They were broader, 
deeper, better. He even studied English all by himself.

'We don't want to get back to the city - and smell petrol or at best various cleaning and washing powders'.

Elena
 said of her humble home:  'It's more comfortable here and 
happier than in civilisation. I am a musician by education, and I get 
upset and insulted by the quality of what's going on in the music 
industry these days. This is what stops me from coming back to society.'
