Roberto Mancini has pledged his support to Galatasaray ahead of the Turkish club's Champions League match against Arsenal.

The 49-year-old left Galatasaray as manager in June with rumours of the club's transfer policy and budget behind the departure, but it seems the former Manchester City boss bares no grudge.

Mancini, donning a bright orange jacket with the club’s crest on, posted a ‘good luck’ snap on Instagram and wrote: 'Come on Galatasaray.'

Galatasaray, under new manager Cesare Prandelli, take on Arsene Wenger's Arsenal at the Emirates in Group D on Wednesday night.

The Super Lig club were held to a 1-1 draw at the Turk Telekom Arena in their opening match, but come into the tie having beaten Sivasspor less than five days ago.

Prandelli will look to take advantage of a weakened Arsenal team, though, as Wenger remains without key midfielders Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey due to injury. 

However, Jack Wilshere has been deemed fit enough to be named in the squad after picking up a late injury in the north London derby against Tottenham, and is a chance to start.
