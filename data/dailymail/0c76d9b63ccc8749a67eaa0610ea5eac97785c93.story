An American property developer is suing a British wine merchant for $25million (£15million) after allegedly being sold a 'fake' bottle of the world's most expensive white wine.

Julian LeCraw Junior, from Atlanta, forked out a staggering $100,000 (£55,000) for the 219-year-old bottle of Château d'Yquem in 2006.

At the time, the precious wine was reportedly flown by private jet across the Atlantic by the London-based Antique Wine Company (AWC).

Prestigious: Mr LeCraw, from Atlanta, forked out a staggering $92,000 (£55,000) for the 219-year-old bottle of Château d'Yquem in 2006. Above, Chateau d'Yquem, which sits atop a hill near Bordeaux's Sauternes region

But eight years on, Mr LeCraw has filed a lawsuit against the firm, alleging that the wine - as well as more than a dozen other bottles - are fake.

The millionaire claims the firm sold him 15 counterfeit wines in total, including two bottles of d'Yquem, 12 of Château Lafite Rothschild and a six-litre bottle of 1908 Château Margaux.

However, the AWC's founder and chief executive, Stephen Williams, strongly denies allegations - and says the company will 'vigorously defend' the case.

Mr LeCraw discovered the alleged fakery after commissioning an American wine expert to taste the fine wines, according to legal documents seen by The Independent.

He claims the expert uncovered evidence that the bottles were fake, including computer-printed wine labels and inaccurate corks and bottle shapes.

Their 'fake' status was then confirmed by experts at d'Yquem and Lafite Rothschild - with one declaring them 'faux, faux, faux', alleges the complaint.  

The sale of the 1787 bottle of d'Yquem to Mr LeCraw in February 2006 was hailed as the highest price ever paid for a bottle of white wine.

As the most prestigious Sauternes dessert
 wine, its high levels of residual sugar, combined with the grapes’ natural acidity, serve as preservative agents which protect it from spoilage.

There are only a few wines in the world that have these unique properties - and if stored properly, d’Yquem can age for indefinite periods.

Chateau d’Yquem itself is one of the most esteemed and highly sought after Chateaux in the world, and sits atop a hill in Bordeaux's Gironde region.

At the time of the sale, Mr Williams, who reportedly delivered the bottle in person by private jet, was quoted as saying: 'It might be the most expensive and pampered travelling companion I have ever had, but at £10,000 a glass, I have to be sure that our client is left with a sweet taste in his mouth.'

However, the white wine was later overtaken as the most valuable in the world by an 1811 bottle of d'Yquem, which was sold for $125,000 (£75,000) to wine connoisseur Christian Vanneque in July 2011.

Mr Vanneque purchased the rare bottle for his establishment, SIP Sunset Grill in Bali, Indonesia, where it went on display in September that year.

Founded in 1982, the AWC specialises in exceptionally fine and rare wines - with more than 20,000 clients in 70 countries. 

In a statement, the firm told MailOnline 
it had provided evidence of authenticity - and rejected claims that Mr 
Williams had flown the bottle of wine to Atlanta by private jet. 

It said: 'The Antique Wine Company strongly denies all the allegations made against it.

World record: In July 2011, an 1811 bottle of d'Yquem, was sold for a staggering $125,000 (£75,000) to wine connoisseur Christian Vanneque (above) - overtaking the 1787 bottle as the world's most expensive white wine

'Since its inception in 1989, [it] has supplied hundreds of bottles of highly valuable wine to customers around the world.

'Ensuring the authenticity of these wines is paramount and they maintain extensive records proving traceability for the suppliers to the company and beyond.'

'The proceedings brought against the
Antique Wine Company will be vigorously defended.'
