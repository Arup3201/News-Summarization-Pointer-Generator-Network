Cincinnati Bengals' defensive tackle Devon Still has revealed that his four-year-old daughter Leah, who is fighting cancer, told him she wants to become a nurse so she can help other sufferers.

The football star, 25, appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show on Thursday to share updates about his plucky daughter, who he says inspires him to push himself on the field.

'She's a fighter and she's going to continue to fight,' he said. 

Still had been cut from the Bengals earlier this year, but after Leah was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma stage 4 in June, the team re-signed him so that he could still receive a pay check and get medical insurance to pay for her treatment at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

Speaking out: Cincinnati Bengals' Devon Still, right, appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show to update viewers about his daughter's condition. Four-year-old Leah has been undergoing treatment for Neuroblastoma

As well as backing from his own team, Still has seen support from other teams and thousands of fans who have worn his jersey - which is now the fastest selling in the Bengals' history.

Speaking to Ellen from Cincinnati, he said that Leah has just finished her third round of chemotherapy, which has hit her hard but that she is continuing to battle the cancer.

It's a tough time for the family, he said, but her smile keeps him going. 

'I know being 10 hours away from my daughter while she's battling for her life is hard for me but I had to make the sacrifice so that my daughter could have insurance to pay for her treatment,' he said. 

'Looking at pictures of her smiling... it lets me know that she's ready to fight this battle and it gives me the confidence to be out here.'

He added that he has nicknamed his daughter the 'Selfie Queen' because no one can ever leave their phone alone around her without returning and finding she has taken pictures of her pulling faces.

Although his daughter can be silly, she can also be serious, he said. 

'I was actually sitting in a hospital with her two days ago and she looked up at me and she said, "Dad I wanna be a nurse when I grow up",' he recounted.

'And I was like, "Where did that come from?" She said, "I don't know i just want to help out kids who have cancer too".'

He went on: 'She has an old soul. It's like she's been here before, she knows what her purpose is.'

Ellen applauded Still for his devotion to his daughter before presenting him with a $10,000 on behalf of Shutterfly to go to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

She said she was also wearing a Bengals' jersey which she and other celebrities would be signing and then putting up for auction. The money raised will also be going to the hospital, she said.

'I know that after every game you fly to Philadelphia to be with your daugter - so you're working hard and you're being by your daughter's side,' Ellen told him. 'You're an amazing guy.'

Doctors have given Leah a 50 per cent chance of survival and football fans across the country have got behind her fight.

The Bengals have said all proceeds from the sale of Still's jersey, number 75, will go toward pediatric cancer research. So far more than $1 million has been raised.

Even competing teams and sports are showing their support by snapping up some of their rival's shirts, with the Bengals thanking the New Orleans Saints for buying 100 jerseys earlier this week.

The Yankees ticket staff posed for a massive group photo showing them wearing the jersey, while cheerleaders for the New England Patriots all donned the jersey last week.

Ever since Leah's diagnosis, Still has shared images on Instagram showing her dancing in the hospital and grinning as she undergoes treatment.

The proud father, who is engaged, has also shaved his head in support of his daughter, who has lost her hair to her treatment.
