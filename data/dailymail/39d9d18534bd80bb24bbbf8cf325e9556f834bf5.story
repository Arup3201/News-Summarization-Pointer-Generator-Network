When Lora Hoagland was fighting to make buses to and from Franklin Township schools in Indiana free for all families, she didn't think her son's very trip to class would land him in the hospital.

It all started when Caleb Jones, 14, unwittingly sat in the seat of a violent classmate, 15, who decided to push, punch and berate when he did not get up while the bus was moving.

A video of the incident was posted on Facebook by the attacker, in which he bragged 'dat wassnt nun'.

Caleb ended up getting staples in his head and the boy, who is a minor, was arrested for battery and disorderly conduct as well as suspended from school.

Mother's Fury: When Lora Hoagland, left, was fighting to make buses to and from Franklin Township schools in Indiana free for all families, she didn't think her son's very trip to class would land him in the hospital with staples in his head, right

'I help to fight to get those buses back,' said a heartbroken Mrs Hoagland to WishTV.

'I’m fighting for parents to get reimbursement back, and that includes this boy’s family and that boy.'

Before Mrs Hoagland's crusade, the families of students at Franklin Township schools had to pay a hefty fee to have their children bussed to school.  Due to her outspokenness, this year, kids rode for free.

She wept as she spoke about the brutal video, in which her son Caleb was thrashed around the school bus while his peers screamed in horror.

'(The video) cut through me like a knife. No mother wants to see her kid get beat up on for standing up for what's right,' she said to ABC.

'I taught my son to stand up for 
what's right, but no mother should have to witness that. No kid should 
have to go through that.'

Caleb was rushed to the hospital after the fight and had to get three staples to his head.

'I don't think I deserved it,' Caleb said to ABC.

After the incident, the video was uploaded onto Facebook and shared amongst the students at Franklin Township Middle School East.

Caleb's attacker posted a message on the video of the fight:'lmao dat lil (expletive) dat wassnt nun i hit him three times nun major yaa-noo'.

Mrs Hoagland wants answers from the school district, but they say their driver followed protocol.

'Franklin Township Community Schools took immediate action, including both our law enforcement and the IMPD, following … safety protocols and procedures,' a statement from the school read.

'(We are) taking appropriate and swift action regarding this matter.'

Mrs Hoagland wants Caleb's attacker off the bus and out of the school district for good.

'Someone will pay , in more ways than one,' Mrs Hoagland said on Facebook. 'They have woke up a screaming giant.'
