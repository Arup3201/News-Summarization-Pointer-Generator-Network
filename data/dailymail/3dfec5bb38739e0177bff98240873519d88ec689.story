Abandoned rowing machines are today gathering dust in basements and garages the world over.

But a new design of rower that doubles up as a side table could mean this once-popular device will once again take pride of place in the home.

The machine was designed by Paris-based inventor Patrick Saint-Martin who wanted to find a stylish way to store bulky gym equipment.

A design of rower that doubles up as a side table could mean the aerobics machine can be hidden in plain sight

Dubbed the ‘Ram and Rower’, the wooden device can be packed up into a table with wheels to help keep it hidden in plain sight.

The rower seat is stored on top of the table, with the wheels hidden beneath. Separate wheels are also attached to the underside of the table so it can be moved into place.

Once the seat is removed the table can be folded out, forming the body of the rowing machine.

The seat can then be clicked into place, and a foam pad placed on top.

The rower is available in various wood finishes and is 150x25x40cm opened and when 60x50x25cm folded

Separate wheels are also attached to the underside of the table so it can be moved into place. 

Once the seat is removed the table can be folded out, forming the body of the rowing machine.

The seat can then be clicked into place, and a foam pad placed on top, creating a fully-functioning rowing machine.  

In a video by the company, the whole process is shown to take around 20 seconds.

It even has an area to prop up a tablet so users can watch videos while working out.

When the user is done exercising, they can fold the rower into a side table, and use the wheels to slide it to the corner of a room.

The rower is available in different wood finishes and measures 150x25x40cm opened and when 60x50x25cm folded.

Starting at $2,300 (£1,520) the Ram & Row costs much more than an annual gym membership and about twice the price of a high-end home rowing machine.
