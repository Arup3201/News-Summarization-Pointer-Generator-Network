His day job involves running the National Health Service.

But today Jeremy Hunt was running the line during the annual party conference football match between Tory MPs and political journalists.

While the Health Secretary avoided any controversy during the 90 minutes, the game ended with his fellow MPs winning 4-2.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt ran the line today during the annual Conservatives v Lobby football match

The game saw Tory MPs including Karl 
McCartney and Nick Boles, planning minister, take to the field for the 
Conservative Party team against the Lobby XI of political hacks.

After making headlines for his 
support for reducing the abortion limit and his handling of Rupert 
Murdoch’s BskyB takeover bid, Mr Hunt will be relieved that the game 
passed off without controversy.

At one stage he failed to raise his 
flag to call offside, but it was seen as the right thing to have done 
because it would have interrupted the flow of play.

Mr Hunt is a fully qualified referee after being trained by the Football Association

As Culture Secretary, he decided on New Year’s Eve 2010 to train as a referee.

Working with the Football Association
he completed hours of training, matches and tests before becoming a 
fully qualified referee and linesman.

He has officiated at games in his South West Surrey constituency and across the country.

Earlier this year he claimed swearing on the pitch had gone too far.

Officiating for a full 90 minutes was obviously thirsty work

He said: ‘I do know a little bit 
about this because I'm a qualified football referee. I've been at the 
receiving end of it and I do think that it has gone too far.

‘I would like to see the football 
authorities do more because I think we just have to recognise that 
football has huge influence on thousands and thousands of young people 
and we do need footballers to set an example.’

The game was played at West Midlands Police football ground.

Fortunately, Tory chief whip Andrew 
Mitchell, who launched a foul-mouthed tirade at officers last month, was
not in the Conservative squad.
