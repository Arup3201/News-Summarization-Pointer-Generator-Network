Sci-fi fans who happened to glance skywards in central London on Saturday night were surprised to see one of the most recognisable and enduring symbols in film and television history as a new star constellation.

The symbol for Starfleet, the intergalactic starship armada from the Star Trek universe that counts the USS Enterprise among its numbers, was emblazoned across the sky above Tower Bridge, astonishing passers-by.

The bold stunt was to promote Star Trek Into Darkness, the second movie of the re-booted franchise chronicling the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk, Spock and Lieutenant Uhura.

However, even moving the stars is beyond the might of movie marketing moguls, and the effect was achieved using small remote control aircraft called quadrotors fitted with powerful light emitting diodes (LED).

Art group Ars Electronica and a German company called Ascending Technologies launched the 30 AscTec Hummingbird quadrotors near London's Tower Bridge and flew in a 94-foot-tall formation to create the incredible sight.

They hovered at between 118 and 426 feet above Potters Fields Park.

The quadcopters, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), communicate with each other and ground controllers via a 2.4GHz transmission channel and have GPS units to achieve the precise positioning.

The formation even rotated slowly, allowing Londoners from all parts of the capital to see it.

The stunt was held to coincide with Earth Hour, where environmental advocates across the world switch lights off for an hour as a show of concern for the environment. In London it took place at 8.30pm on Saturday.

To coincide with the environmental theme, the batteries that powered the quadcopters were charged on the Austrian renewable energy grid, according to event sponsor Paramount Pictures.

To mark Earth Hour, the LEDs went dim along with the lights on Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament, and the London Eye, then turned on 60 minutes later.

A combination of controllers on the ground and sophisticated computer programming allowed the quadcopters to stay in formation

Tracking: Global positioning technology was also used in the incredible marketing stunt

In September Ars Electronica Futurelab flew 50 quadrotors with pulsating, multicoloured lights in a synchronised display.

UAVS are deployed predominantly for 
military applications, but are now also used by non-military 
organisations, such as firefighters, police, and now marketing 
companies.

Star Trek Into Darkness is released in May and stars Chris Pine as Captain James T. Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Commander Spock, British actor Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain and Karl Urban as Lieutenant Commander Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy.
