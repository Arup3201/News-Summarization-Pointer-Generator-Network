Fears the end of the Mayan calendar predicts the end of the world this coming December have run rife on the internet in recent years.

Less well known is the rumour that one particular mountain in south-west France will burst open on that day revealing an alien spaceship which will carry nearby humans to safety.

Well, if you were counting on that possibility to save you from the apocalypse, prepare to be disappointed. French officials have banned access to the Pic de Bugarach to avoid a rush of New Age fanatics, sightseers and, above all, journalists.

A hundred police and firefighters will also control approaches to the tiny village of the same name at the foot of the mountain, and if too many people turn up, they will block access there too.

Believers say the world will end on December 21, 2012, the end date of the ancient Mayan calendar, and they see Bugarach as one of a few sacred mountains sheltered from the cataclysm.

Eric Freysselinard, France's top official in the area, told AFP: 'We are expecting a few visionaries, a few people who believe in this end of the world, but in extremely limited numbers.

'We are expecting greater numbers of people who are just curious, but in numbers we cannot determine. Above all, we are expecting lots of journalists.'

Films, documentaries and websites have
 promoted the idea that the ancient Mayan calendar, which is made up of 
394-year periods called baktuns, predicts that doomsday is on December 
21.

Experts estimate the system starts 
counting at 3114 B.C., and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 
years, around December 21.

They say 13 was a significant number 
for the Maya, and the end of that cycle would be a milestone â€” but they 
have been keen to stress that it does not mark an end.

Conspiracy theorists nonetheless 
believe the Maya may have been privy to impending astronomical disasters
 that would coincide with 2012, ranging from explosive storms on the 
surface of the sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic 
alignment that could trigger a reversal in Earth's magnetic field.

The culture ministry in Guatemala - 
where half the population are of Mayan descent - is hosting a massive 
event in the capital just in case the world actually does end, while 
tour groups are promoting doomsday-themed getaways.

But the country's Maya alliance 
Oxlaljuj Ajpop accuses the government and tour groups of perpetuating 
the myth that their calendar foresees the imminent end of the world for 
monetary gain.

It issued a statement last month 
saying that the new Maya time cycle simply 'means there will be big 
changes on the personal, family and community level, so that there is 
harmony and balance between mankind and nature.'

In September Mexican government 
archaeologist Alfredo Barrera said that the Maya tried to make 
predictions, but perhaps about more humdrum events like droughts or 
disease outbreaks.

Big plans: Arguing Mayan prophecies beyond 2012, king of Palenque, K'inich Hanaab Pakal, pictured, said he would return to Earth a couple thousands years from now in the future

'The Mayas did make prophecies, but 
not in a fatalistic sense, but rather about events that, in their 
cyclical conception of history, could be repeated in the future,' said 
Barrera, of the National Institute of Anthropology and History.

Experts have stressed that the ancient
 Maya, whose 'classic' culture of writing, astronomy and temple 
complexes flourished from the year 300 to 900, were extremely interested
 in future events, far beyond Dec. 21.

'There are many ancient Maya monuments
 that discuss events far into the future from now,' wrote Geoffrey 
Braswell, an anthropologist at the University of California at San 
Diego. 'The ancient Maya clearly believed things would happen far into 
the future from now.'

'The king of Palenque, K'inich Hanaab 
Pakal, believed he would return to the Earth a couple of thousand years 
from now in the future,' Dr Braswell wrote in an email to The Associated
 Press. 'Moreover, other monuments discuss events even before the 
creation in 3114 B.C.'

Only a couple of references to the 
2012 date equivalency have been found carved in stone at Maya sites, and
 neither refers to an apocalypse, experts say.

Such apocalyptic visions have been 
common for more than 1,000 years in Western, Christian thinking, and are
 not native to Maya thought.

'This is thinking that, in truth, has 
nothing to do with Mayan culture,' said Alexander Voss, an 
anthropologist at the University Of Quintana Roo, a state on Mexico's 
Caribbean coast. 'This thing about looking for end-times is not 
something that comes from Mayan culture.'

Dr Braswell compared the Maya 
calendar, with its system of cycles within cycles, to the series of 
synchronized wheels contained in old, analogue car odometers.

'The Maya long count system is like a 
car odometer,' Braswell wrote. 'My first car (odometer) only had six 
wheels so it went up to 99,999.9 miles. That didn't mean the car would 
explode after reaching 100,000 miles.'
