Iconic: The famous Playboy bunny ears will soon be seen in India

Playboy is about to introduce its risque bunny ears to India - but the club plans to remove the sex and play up the glamour in a country where even kissing in films is a touchy subject.

The club's promoters will launch the 
country's first club in Goa in December - a 22,000 sq ft open-air 
property in the Candolim Beach tourist hot-spot.

But the bodices, bunny ears and 
cotton tails familiar to Playboy patrons are likely to be absent, instead replaced with demure bunnies in an 'aspirational' setting.

The Indian club's chief executive, Sanjay Gupta, said he wanted to create a club which his wife would feel comfortable visiting - a far cry from the other 40 or so Playboy clubs in the world.

The club scheduled to open in mid-December, followed by a 
second club in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad early next year.

Gupta added the bunnies will still be present - 
but their costumes for the moment are 'confidential'.

He said: 'Bunnies are an integral part of Playboy
 culture. We 
will have bunnies but keeping in mind Indian sensibilities, we are 
toning down the costume.

'We are working very closely with Playboy to 
design a bunny outfit for India.'

Though Indians may soon get to mingle 
with bunnies on the beach, they still cannot buy Playboy magazine, which
 is banned in India.

PB Lifestyle is a Mumbai-based 
company with an exclusive license from Playboy Enterprises to open 
Playboy clubs, hotels, bars and cafes and sell Playboy branded 
merchandise in India.

Gupta
 said he wants to separate the powerful Playboy brand from its adult 
associations, remaking it as an aspirational lifestyle brand for the 
growing Indian middle class.

He
 pledged to build clubs his wife would want to visit and plans an 
aggressive advertising campaign to strip his venture of any adult 
associations.

'We will dissociate from nudity completely,' he said. 'We are positioning it around lifestyle, aspiration and glamour.'

It
 is a far cry from the Playboy clubs dotted across the world, such as 
London's original Playboy Club at 45 Park Lane, which opened in 1966 and
 became a noted hangout for celebrities and the wealthy.

It closed in 1981 after gaming licences were revoked and London was without a Playboy Club for 30 years.

Although the magazine is still one of America's
 best-selling titles, sales have dropped to about three million 
an issue from around seven million in 1972.

With the Indian club, the company has so far been vexed in the effort to get away from its international image.

Media
 outlets have plastered photos of Sherlyn Chopra, the first Indian woman
 to pose nude for Playboy magazine, next to articles about the club.Â 

'I
 have nothing against her, but as an Indian lady she is associated with 
Playboy magazine,' Gupta said. 'PB Lifestyle has nothing to do with 
that.'

He said the 
company plans to invest $37.5 million to open clubs, bars and cafes over
 the next five years, with a goal of opening 120 outlets, including 
retail stores, over the next decade.

Local officials will be monitoring Gupta's efforts with interest.

'Assuming there is going to be vulgarity and activities that are not in tune with the Goan culture, their proposal will not be granted permission,' said Nikhil Desai, Goa's director of tourism.

'However, they could be setting up a perfectly decent club.'

However Goa tourism 
minister Dilip Parulekar said the state government will not permit a 
Playboy Club in Goa.

He said the state is already fighting the menaces 
of prostitution and drug peddling and is not willing to attract any more
 issues.

'We will not entertain anyone who is here to spread obscenity and nudity,' he said.

Women's
 organisations had raised objections to the opening of such a club in 
the state, claiming it would show the region in a poor light.
