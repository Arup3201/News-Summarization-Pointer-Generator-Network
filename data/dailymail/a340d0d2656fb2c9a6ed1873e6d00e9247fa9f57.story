Tottenham have made a last minute bid to land MK Dons wonderkid Dele Alli.

Newcastle and Aston Villa both have offers in for the 18-year-old midfielder - but Mauricio Pochettino wants to steal the youngster from under their noses.

Sportsmail revealed last week how Villa launched a bid to rival Newcastle in the race for Alli.

Newcastle have always been viewed as the favourites to land the midfielder in a £5million deal, but Tottenham's move has thrown a further spanner in the works.

The Magpies' move remains the most advanced, but a move to White Hart Lane could suit the talented youngster.

Alli has scored 12 goals in 32 appearances for Karl Robinson's side so far this season and starred in the 4-0 Capital One Cup win against Manchester United back in August. 

Spurs will have to beat off competition from Newcastle and Aston Villa if they are to sign Alli
