Jeremy Paxman has angered elderly people after joking about them on his stand-up comedy debut

Jeremy Paxman has angered elderly people after suggesting that euthanasia clinics should be set up on every street corner during his stand-up comedy debut.

The former Newsnight host made the controversial comment during a warm up gig for his new Edinburgh Fringe show at an Islington theatre last night.

The 64-year-old qualifies for his own pension next year, but the Evening Standard reported that he said on stage: 'The dislike of old people - I share this prejudice despite almost being one myself.

'The problem with old people is they are bloody everywhere. You cannot get on a train or go to a country pub.

'They are all full of old people.

'Through no fault of their own, they believe the state owes them a living.

'They are under the illusion they have paid to a pension fund all their lives. But they haven't.'

He went on to blame the government, saying: 'Successive governments have comprehensively mismanaged the whole pension arrangements in this country.

'Their pensions are being paid out of what you earn.

'So we all have to keep working so they can stay in that state of euphoria.

'I would like to invite you all to join my crowd-funded project for franchises of Dignitas clinics.

'We will have them on every street corner. It would be rather like Sweeney Todd's pie shop and will be disguised as tea shops.

'You will take Aunty Doris there and drop her off and she will say "see you next Tuesday" and you'll say "probably".'

Dignitas is an organisation in Switzerland which assists people in taking their own lives when they have a terminal or severe mental or physical illness.

Pensioner groups have spoken out against the journalist's comments, slamming them as 'inconsiderate' and 'unjust'.

Neil White, Director of Southwark Pensioners Centre, said: ‘A lot of people have paid into this county through many decades of their lives and everyone has the right to pay into it and later withdraw a pension.

‘The older generation are the ones who fought for our rights and our dignity as a country.

'They’re the generations who went through the wars and saw the roots of the NHS, the are who we should honour and respect.

Paxman quit as Newsnight host in June, and is being replaced by journalist and Dragons' Den host Evan Davis

‘They 
deserve retirement, a lot of them have worked for many years and 
supported their children through many difficult circumstances. 

‘They have paid in so they deserve to reap the benefits.’ 

‘It’s
 unfair and not very considerate what Mr Paxman said. Everyone has 
grandparents and parents, you only have to speak with them to see the 
challenges they have gone through and face now. 

‘If
 Mr Paxman would like to find out how the other half live we’d love to 
introduce him to some of our members who have fought for this country 
and sacrificed a lot to pay into the system and support their families 
and communities.'

Mr White added the TV presenter's comments about Dignitas were unhelpful and muddied a controversial debate.

‘The
 Dignitas comment is not a helpful comment, it’s a controversial issue 
and he would be more advised to do more research and find out what the 
real situation is.’ 

‘Every
 day we see people come to us for guidance who is relying on benefits 
and some of them have contributed to the UK economy for 50 or 60 years.’

‘We need to support older people as a society. ‘

Paxman's
 Islington performance was a warm up for the main event -  his new show 
'Paxo', which he is taking to the Edinburgh Fringe next week.

He quit as Newsnight host in June, to be replaced by Evan Davis, and though he continues as quizmaster on University Challenge, he has turned to stand-up to fill the void.

Around 200 people attended the gig at the Pleasance Theatre, which saw him use a spinning wheel labelled with different topics, which he would then rant about in trademark style when the needle landed on them. 

Paxman's new show will play all week from Monday August 18 at the Pleasance Cabaret Bar in Edinburgh.
