Friends and strangers have donated more than $10,000 to the only survivor of a car crash that killed a young professor and her husband in Upstate New York last weekend: their dog Sawyer.

Tatyana Buynitsky, a 28-year-old professor at Simmons College, and her husband, Rory Wingham, 32, were driving on Interstate 88 in Colesville last Friday when they lost control of their car on the icy road and were hit by a tractor trailer.

But Finn, who suffered a slipped disc that left him unable to stand or walk, took a turn for the worst a few days later, and Buynitsky's family decided to put the beloved dog down.

Left behind: Tatyana Buynitsky, 28, and her husband, Rory Wingham, 32, (pictured at their wedding in November 2013) both died in a car crash last week. Their dog, Sawyer, was the only survivor

However, they also learned that Sawyer had miraculously survived and had been found wandering along a road by a nearby resident, who has now returned him to the mourning family.

'He's the only one who made it out of the accident alive,' Steven Buynitsky, 19, told the Boston Globe. 'Being with him has definitely helped [us] to cope with our loss.'

He initially set up the fundraising page to help with Finn's veterinary costs before he was put down. 

The funds will be now used to cover the two animals' immediate medical costs, and the remainder will be donated to charities and go towards a scholarship in the couple's names.

The Buynitskys are also focusing on caring for Sawyer.

'My sister and Rory had so much love for him and we are trying to make him just as happy as he was then,' Buynitsky said. 'We got him back safe with just a couple of scratches so we think he is extremely special.' 

He added that the family had learned just how much his sister and her husband were loved because of the outpouring of support they have received since the tragedy.

Staff at Simmons, where Buynitsky worked in the school's Behavior Analysis program, also expressed their heartbreak at the loss of 'a friend, teacher, mentor, and colleague'.

'We are all shocked and saddened by their sudden deaths,' Simmons President Helen Drinan said in a statement on Tuesday. 

Buynitsky had attended Boston University for her undergraduate degree and received her master's and doctoral degrees at Simmons, which is in Boston. She became a board-certified behavior analyst in 2012.

Wingham was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and went to high school in Kent, England before studying at Northeastern University. At the time of his death he was a product manager for software company Intuit and had previously worked for Nasdaq and Thomson Reuters.

The couple, who bonded over their love of Disney, became engaged on a trip to Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, and married in November 2013. 

Another gofundme page set up for the couple's charitable foundation said that they 'gave of themselves selflessly, worked hard to better their communities, and loved their friends, their dogs, and their family with inspiring generosity'.

It added: 'They were each in the process of finishing their degrees and launching careers devoted to service and the betterment of those around them.'

Loss: Buynitsky worked in the Behavior Analysis program for Simmons College in Boston, while her husband, who was born in South Africa, was a product manager for software company, Intuit

New home: Sawyer is now settling in with Buynitsky's family, who have another dog, Cherry, right

The scholarship in their name will be for students pursuing degrees in Social Work and in Finance and who dedicate themselves and their careers to community service, the page explained.

On the evening of the crash, Buynitsky had been behind the wheel in their Honda Civic and attempting to overtake a tractor trailer when she lost control on black ice  around 5.10pm.

Their car struck a guiderail and after veering directly into the tractor trailer's path, they were hit by the vehicle, police said, WBNG reported.

Wingham was pronounced dead at the scene while Buynitsky was taken to United Health Services Wilson Medical Center, where she later died.

The driver of the truck was not injured in the crash and no charges have been filed.

State police said that the roads were covered with ice, causing another crash less than a mile away.
