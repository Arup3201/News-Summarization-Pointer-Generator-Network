The trustees at a failing Muslim school that forced female staff to wear the hijab have agreed to resign, it emerged yesterday.

The Al-Madinah School in Derby was told they will be replaced by a more experienced team with the ‘skills and capability’ to make improvements.

The chief executive of another trust has been asked to step in at the ‘dysfunctional’ free school – which was put in special measures by Ofsted last month.

Changing hands: The Al-Madinah School in Derby was told senior staff will be replaced by a more experienced team with the ¿skills and capability¿ to make improvements

Schools Minister Lord Nash wrote to the school’s chairman of governors Shazia Parveen, saying: ‘I am not satisfied that you have demonstrated a strong basis for the transformation required at the school.

‘I cannot tolerate any child experiencing a poor quality of education in any state-funded school and am therefore determined to ensure there is a swift resolution.

‘You and your fellow trustees have agreed to resign in due course.’

Controversy: The school was criticised in September for allegedly threatening non-Muslim staff to wear hijabs

Barry Day, chief executive of the Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust, will now start work with the school.

The trust has a proven ability to transform struggling schools and a track record of providing high-quality education to children from a Muslim background, said Lord Nash.

The Department for Education said the plan to improve Al-Madinah underlined the Government’s commitment to take ‘swift and decisive’ action against under-performing schools. Al-Madinah, one of the Government’s flagship free schools, opened last September.

On its website it was billed as having a strong Muslim ethos with shorter holidays and longer school days to boost learning opportunities.

But last month it was condemned as ‘in chaos’ by inspectors from Ofsted, who said the school had failed to keep pupils safe and was led by an ineffective governing body.

The watchdog found older pupils were made to sit on different sides of the classrooms according to their sex. Singing and fairy tales were banned for being un-Islamic and even the word ‘pig’ was prohibited.

In September there were claims that non-Muslim female staff were forced to wear hijabs.

Miss Parveen said in a statement: ‘The trust will ensure that the  transition is smooth and the ethos of the faith-designated school remains secure.

‘We acknowledge the positive  input to allow our children to progress and have an academic success and a positive future.’
