Manuel Pellegrini revealed who he believes is the best player in English football... and surprisingly it wasn't his Manchester City star striker Sergio Aguero.

In fact, the City boss confessed it is actually Arsenal talisman Alexis Sanchez who is proving to be the best in the country, following his brace and assist in his side's 3-0 win over Stoke on Sunday.

Speaking with AS, the 61-year-old Chilean highlighted just why he thinks his compatriot is the hottest property, having provided 12 goals and seven assists for the Gunners since his £32million transfer from Barcelona last summer.

Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini claimed that Sanchez was the best player in English football

'Every game I see him making a great effort, showing great commitment, ambition and the maturity needed to keep improving year after year.' Pellegrini said.

'I'm happy for him because at this time he is the best player in English football.'

Pellegrini's comments may have surprised some sections of supporters at the Etihad - considering his very own striker Sergio Aguero netted 14 times for his club before being hit with a knee ligament injury in December - but he could not deny the talents of the former Barcelona number 9. 

'I always thought [he was going to be world class]. The only thing you could criticise him for before was that he didn't score enough goals. 

'He wasn't a scorer. But he has improved this a lot in the last two campaigns.'

Despite a slow start to his career at the Catalan giants, Sanchez ended his final season at the Nou Camp with 19 La Liga goals to his name before making the switch to north London.

'Alexis has progressed in recent years. His spell at Barcelona has been very useful for him as well as sharing a team with great players.'

Andrew Cole - 18 goals, 4 assists

Kevin Phillips - 19 goals, 2 assists

Alexis Sanchez - 12 goals, 7 assists

Eric Cantona - 10 goals, 9 assists

Sergio Aguero - 14 goals, 4 assists

The Chilean international's immediate impact in the Premier League is certainly making him stand out from the crowd. 

The 26-year-old's exploits after his first 20 games in England's top flight are third only to those of Andrew Cole (Newcastle United) and Kevin Phillips (Sunderland), who were directly involved in 22 and 21 goals respectively compared to Sanchez's 19.

Interestingly Aguero sits fifth in the same standings, behind former Leeds and Manchester United forward Eric Cantona.

Pellegrini's comments will surely spur the Argentine on to regain the form he showed prior to his injury after his goalless return to action on Saturday when he came off the bench in the 1-1 draw at Everton.
