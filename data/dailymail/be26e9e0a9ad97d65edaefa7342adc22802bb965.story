A Florida teenager told a friend that he stood behind his mother for about five minutes in contemplation before finally plunging a hammer into her head, according to police documents released on Wednesday.

Police said Tyler Hadley, 17, described the attacks to an unidentified friend at the party he threw in his Port St Lucie home last Saturday night after the killings.

By the friend's account, when Hadley struck his mother with the hammer, she screamed one final question to her son: 'Why?'

Parents: Mary Jo and Blake Hadley who were bludgeoned to death in their homes by a hammer and hidden in a room while their son had a party

When his father walked into the room,
Hadley told the friend that they locked eyes before he started beating 
his father with the hammer, too.

The boy took his parents' cell phones
away ahead of the attack so they couldn't call for help, according to 
his friend's account.

When it was over, and the parents 
were dead, Hadley spent three hours cleaning up the blood, before 
hosting dozens of friends while the bodies were hidden inside a bedroom. Hadley told the friend he was surprised how 
long the clean-up took.

Hadley is charged with murder in the 
deaths of Blake and Mary-Jo Hadley and is being held without bond. His 
public defender, Mark Harllee, entered a written not guilty plea on his 
client's behalf on Wednesday, but said he couldn't comment further.

Best friend: Michael Mandell claims Hadley confessed to the crimes and told him he was possessed by the devil and had taken three ecstasy tablets

'We're still looking at all the facts and all the paperwork,' he said.

It was reported yesterday Hadley confessed to a friend he was possessed by the devil and had taken three ecstasy tablets 
before the murders.

The teenager allegedly told Michael Mandell that he did it because of a
combination of rap music, constant fights with his parents and the fact
they had financial problems.

There have been no suggestions as to what his motive may have been for the brutal murders until now.

Speaking to Treasure Coast 
Newspapers, Michael, who lives only a few doors away from the Hadleys 
and said he has known the 17-year-old his whole life, recounts the 
moment Hadley confessed to the crimes.

He said: 'He asked me to stay there 
until after everyone left to see them and I didn't want to. I went in 
there and checked for myself.

'I opened the door. I saw bloody 
sheets piled everywhere. I saw broken pictures with blood on them and I 
looked down and I saw his dad's leg there.'

Michael said that Hadley also told him that the 'devil had possessed him' and said if he was caught he would commit suicide.

He also said he believed drugs was the motive.

'I feel like this kid that I've known
all my life, I don't know him. His family was my family,' Michael said.
'They were very good people. I 
really don't see any motive besides drugs.

'He took three ecstasy pills before he did this. He said he couldn't do it sober.

Family: Hadley's mother Mary-Jo and father Blake were found beaten to death with a hammer, which was lying between their bodies

Hadley, seen here in his booking photo, has been charged as an adult for the killings

'After he told me, I didn't believe him because he's been my best friend forever. I would never suspect anything like this.

'I was looking around, he told me if I look enough I could see signs. I looked on the floor and could see signs of blood.'

Authorities believe Hadley killed his parents with a 22-inch framing hammer before
using books, files and towels to cover their bodies after he sent out 
the Facebook invitation to the party earlier that day.

Micahel said that he was 'having a fun time at the party and acting as if everything was normal'.

He even took a photo with his best friend, saying he thought it would be the last time they would see each other.

Scene: Hadley allegedly killed his parents before hosting a party at the family home

The police came to the Hadley home at 4.20am on Sunday morning after they received a tip off.

Michael said it was not him who called police as he was 'too shocked' and 'just felt sick'.

Morgan
Noel, Michael's girlfriend, said: 'I remember him making a weird 
statement like a couple months ago, that the devil has possessed him, 
and he was going crazy.'

Hadley will not face the death 
penalty due to the fact he is a minor despite the fact he has been tried
on two counts of first-degree murder as an adult.

He is likely to serve a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty.

Chief Assistant State Attorney Tom Bakkedahl said: 'It’s simply off the table, it’s not a viable option.

Clues: Port St Lucie Police crime scene investigators collect evidence from the Hadley home on Sunday after the bodies were found

Weapon: Police issued a picture of a hammer similar to the one they believed was used to kill the Hadleys

'Despite
the fact that the case may otherwise in all respects warrant the death 
penalty, we are prohibited from seeking it as a result of Hadley being 
approximately six months short of his 18th birthday.'

Hadley
was wearing a sleeveless black jail uniform as he appeared via video 
conference from the St Lucie County Jail in front of a judge at the 
courthouse.

He spoke only 
three times during the hearing - once when he was asked to confirm his 
name, then to answer whether or not he had an attorney and when asked if
he had any questions when told he was denied bail.

Medical examiners are continuing to carry out tests on the bodies throughout today and tomorrow.

State attorney Bakkedahl 
said the injuries suffered by the two victims, suggest the killings were
premeditated or committed during an angry rage.

He
said: 'In my personal opinion, any time you have a murder, you have 
some degree or rage, so that is really meaningless to me, but it’s 
certainly significant. I mean it’s just incredible, the injuries.'

The party went on from around 9pm to 3am and the police arrived after an anonymous tip off around 4.20am.

Hadley had been 'nervous and panicky,' they said and there were beer cans strewn all over the garden.

He initially told police his parents were out of town.

Police then found the bodies of Mr and Mrs Hadley in the master bedroom where the door had been locked.

Mrs Hadley, 47, is believed to have been killed first and then Mr Hadley, 54, afterwards.

They were not, authorities believe, killed in the bedroom where their bodies were found.

While is not clear what the motive for 
the alleged killing was, a resident told WSVN News he had heard Hadley's
parents had refused to let the teen have a party.

Similarly
one of the teens attending the party said to WOKV that the 17-year-old 
killed his parents because they 'wouldn't let him throw a party.'

The teen had dropped out of his high 
school and the family was being sued for $15,000 after Hadley hit and 
injured a child while driving a car registered to his father in June 
2010, according to court documents.

Hadley has been arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder.

'I've known Mary-Jo since she was in high school in Fort Lauderdale,' family friend Charlene Moses told WPTV.

'They are a nice family. The kids are always nice.'
Tyler reportedly has an older brother who recently moved out the house.

Blake Hadley was an employee of Florida Power & Light Co. and wife Mary Jo worked for 24 years as an elementary school teacher with the St. Lucie County School District.
