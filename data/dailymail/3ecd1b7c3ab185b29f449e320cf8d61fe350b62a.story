The attorney's representing the parents of Michael Brown said today that they have forensic evidence the unarmed teen was shot dead with his hands up by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

Attorney's Benjamin Crump and Anthony Gray were supposed to be joined at Thursday's press conference by Brown's parents, but instead revealed that their private autopsy shows the 18-year-old was surrendering when he was fatally gunned down.

Crump and Gray also used their public appearance to admonish Missouri Governor Jay Nixon for warning protesters not to riot after the grand jury decision instead of telling the heavily armed police to control themselves too.

Final days: Benjamin Crump addresses the media in St, Louis as the grand jury investigation into whether or not to indict officer Darren Wilson enters its final stage

The news conference occurred at the same time as Dr. Michael Baden testified before the grand jury in St. Louis. Baden performed the private autopsy at the request of Brown's family in August.

After reading their prepared statements, Crump took questions from the press and re-itereated the Brown family's opinion that the grand jury is a political fudge and lacks transparency because it is behind closed doors.

Moreover, Crump said he feels the grand jury is a waste of time and fails in its responsibility to justice.

'There was enough probably cause to charge Officer Darren Wilson with killing Michael Brown,' said Crump.

In Missouri, Governor Jay Nixon said on Tuesday the National Guard would be on standby to respond to any violence after the grand jury decision. Nixon said 1,000 police officers had undergone more than 5,000 hours of specialized training ahead of the grand jury decision

The family then urged restraint on the part of both protesters and police once a grand jury decides whether the officer who shot him should face criminal charges.

Attorneys Anthony Gray and Benjamin Crump held a press conference Thursday outside the St. Louis County Justice Center, where the grand jury is meeting and Dr. Michael Baden, who performed a private autopsy on the family's behalf, was scheduled to testify.

Crump said attorneys would not get into the substance of Baden's testimony, except to say he had identified one additional entry wound in Brown's chest. He did not elaborate on what that might mean.

Brown's parents, who were in Geneva this week as the U.N. Committee Against Torture heard testimony about U.S. policies, did not attend.

On Wednesday, the family of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen shot dead by a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri in August, have called for their neighbors and supporters to keep calm whether or not a grand jury chooses to indict Officer Darren Wilson.

Gunned down: The August shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by Darren Wilson sparked a national debate on race relations and led to weeks of street demonstrations. Some groups have threatened extensive protests if the officer is not charged with a crime

Brown's father Michael Sr. made the call for peace as he and Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden visited Geneva to ask for continued U.N. pressure on the United States government over the affair.

Back in Missouri, meanwhile, Governor Jay Nixon said on Tuesday the National Guard would be on standby to respond to any violence after the grand jury decision.

Nixon said 1,000 police officers had undergone more than 5,000 hours of specialized training ahead of the grand jury decision.

Hoping such training and force would not be necessary, Brown Sr. said Wednesday:

'Me and his mother have come to the U.N. to get redress for our son,' Brown Sr. told a news conference after a session of the U.N. Committee on Torture which held a regular review of the U.S. record. 'There couldn't be a better place to do that.'

'The Brown family continue to call for non-violence. They continue to feel the Grand Jury will do the right thing,' Parks told reporters in Geneva.

In addition to the National Guard, police officers from across the state could be called on to restore order if protests get out of hand, Nixon told a news conference.

A decision by the grand jury is expected in mid-to-late November.

The August shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by Darren Wilson sparked a national debate on race relations and led to weeks of street demonstrations. Some groups have threatened extensive protests if the officer is not charged with a crime.

'That ugliness was not representative of Missouri and it cannot be repeated,' Nixon said.
