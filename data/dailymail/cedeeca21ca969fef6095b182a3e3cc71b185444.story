A mother's petty argument with her young daughter caused her to miss the devastating mudslide, which crashed through the town of Oso, Washington, by mere minutes on Saturday.

Angela Durant, 40, who lives in Darrington, was heading to work at the Trafton General Store in Arlington but was 15 minutes late because she was bickering with her nine-year-old, Sarah.

Those precious minutes saved Ms Durant's life. Her journey to work along Highway 530 was cut short Saturday by what she first thought was a logging truck up ahead, turned sideways and blocking the road.

As she climbed from her car to take a closer look, she realized it was tree trunks piled high that had been swept down the mountainside in a sea of mud - and the roof of someone's home was just visible alongside.

The mother of two told MailOnline today: 'My daughter saved my life. She is the reason that I was not there when that slide hit.'

Ms Durant was one of the first on the scene, and from the other side of the rushing mud, water and debris, she could see an elderly man around 200 feet away, standing by his truck and waving his arms in the air, shouting words to her that she could not hear.

She said: 'I pulled out my cell phone and there was no network, the only number I could call was 911. I told them they had to come, that a man was trapped on the other side, and that there could be other people trapped underneath the mud.

â€˜It just seemed like the wall of the mountain had come down and the noise was like a powerful, slamming wind.

'Around 10-15 cars pulled up behind me and people got out to look at what had happened. We were trying to be quiet to listen for people calling out but there was no one.'

Ms Durant gave the first responders the number of a mailbox - 294925B - which was the only thing left standing in the debris to help them locate the disaster site. She said that within three minutes, the emergency teams were there.

'I saw what used to be a pump house float by, the roofs of people's homes, a garbage can. There was smoke coming from the pump house; I was worried that it was going to explode while the rescuers were searching.'

Ms Durant said that on Highway 530 where the road should have dipped ahead of her, it was completely leveled.

'I cannot wrap my head around what's happened,' she said.

Ms Durant, who also has a 16-year-old daughter, Lizzy, was born in Southport, Seattle, but has lived in Darrington for 30 years.

'I've left a couple of times,' she said. 'But something makes me come back - it's the way that people treat each other here. And those mountains.'

Ms Durant was helping out alongside Tom and Diana Gent at the Darrington Rodeo. The couple have established a place where rescued animals can be cared for and local residents can pick up dog and cat food, and hay for horses.

A few horses were already being cared for on the grounds Thursday. Mr Gent, who works full-time at Monroe prison, volunteered to set up the valuable service for Darrington.

He said: 'We do what we can; every day is a learning experience. Everyone knows their neighbors in this town, itâ€™s tightknit, so you do what you can to help.â€™

Mrs Gent added: 'I can't get out on the slide, but helping with the animals is something I can do.'

Sixteen bodies have been recovered, but officials say at least nine more had been found as of Wednesday night.

The medical examiner's office has so far formally identified only a single victim, 45-year-old Christina Jefferds. Family members have confirmed a handful of other fatalities to news organizations.

The main goal now is to find more bodies and winnow the list of the 90 people who are still missing in the mudslide that buried the community of Oso on Saturday.
