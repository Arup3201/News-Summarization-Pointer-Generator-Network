The ex-fiance of a young woman caught on camera having sex with a colleague in their office by a group of pub goers has spoken out saying no one wants to see their 'ex on telly doing that'.

The secretary and her married boss were filmed having sex at their Marsh Ltd workplace in Christchurch after they left the lights on in their office building on Friday night.

Gobsmacked pub patrons cheered them on from across the street and uploaded footage of their public sex show to social media.

The young woman's ex-fiance, who only identified himself as Josh, told The Edge radio station she was not cheating because they broke off their engagement six months before she was filmed with her boss, the New Zealand Herald reports. 

'You don't want to see your ex on telly doing that (but) it's nothing to do with me,' he said. 

'She never made any mistake (when she was with me). Unfortunately she made this one and it's gone worldwide.'

Josh said he knew the man his ex-fiance was filmed with but had never met him. He said he hadn't spoken with her this week but admitted he hoped she was okay. 

'She is a really nice person ... she's lovely. We had a really amazing relationship,' he said. 

'I think for everyone involved it's quite sad.'

The two employees may be able to keep their jobs at the insurance company if they are brave enough to return to work again after footage of their sex romp went viral. 

But if they do return, they are likely to be working in different buildings.

The company is taking 'their time' over the disciplinary process, a source told the paper.

On Wednesday it was revealed the wife of the manager caught with his trousers down shockingly found out about the man's extramarital affair on Facebook.

The married man, understood to have children, has still not shown his face at insurance firm Marsh Ltd in Christchurch as bosses conduct an employment investigation. 

The young secretary is also keeping a low profile having already deleted her Facebook account. 

A source told the New Zealand Herald that the man's wife is 'in pieces and can't even speak to him'. 

The couple had gone into the office after it had closed thinking they'd get some privacy when they were actually being watched by patrons across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery

The mood at the Christchurch branch is said to be 'rather tense'. 

'The other employees are all keeping their heads down and are just trying to get on with things. It's a pretty surreal situation for them,' an insurance industry insider said.

The sexual antics of the man and the young woman were caught on camera last Friday night and footage quickly went viral across the world. 

The incident provoked a huge reaction with one witness saying that because it went on for 'a good half hour', patrons in the bar 'started to get bored and drift off back to the dance floor'. 

'The entire bar united in cheering them on,' said one person on social network Reddit. 

'It started with a casual flirt. Then the kiss, grabbing the attention of all. Get it, son! Finally they moved to the back of them room, thinking they were unseen. Off comes the tights, down goes his head. By this stage, 50 bar patrons were pressed up against the window yelling their approval.

The couple even enjoyed a glass of wine as they enjoyed their own private party

Customers across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery got a front-row seat for the show

'To be honest, after watching them f*** for a good half hour, people started to get bored and drift off back to the dancefloor.'  

However, it got so steamy at one stage that the band even stopped playing in the bar. But when calm was restored the cheeky musicians started up again with Kings of Leon song, Sex on Fire.

'The band had to delay playing because the customers felt the need to support this view. Props to them for their next song being Sex on Fire,' one Reddit user said. 

Rabobank's branding was also in many pictures on social media, only because it had naming rights to the building. Not that they escaped ridicule either.

'Congrats to the man who made a deposit at Rabobank this evening,' one Twitter follower posted.

One Reddit user said: 'I guess it's not a bank for money.' While another also quipped on Reddit: 'When he withdrew he lost interest!'

The Privacy Commissioner John Edwards told Radio New Zealand that there was little the sexy pair could do legally following some local backlash against those who filmed the incident in the bar.

Several commentators in New Zealand claimed that the couple's privacy had been breached, but Mr Edwards said it was unlikely the police could take action if a complaint was made.

'The people who were watching, we may criticise them for a lapse of decency in taking advantage of that, but it is unlikely there'd be any legal liability for their action,' he said.

Privacy lawyer Kathryn Dalziel also told Radio New Zealand even though the couple did not give their consent for the images to be taken, they would have to show their privacy had been breached to make a successful case under the Crimes Act. 

Marsh Ltd said they still had not made any decision on whether the couple would get the sack or face any disciplinary action.

'We are not giving any further comment other than what has already been provided. We're dealing with the matter internally that's all we can say,' a spokeswoman for Marsh Ltd told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's unknown what will happen to those involved at this stage, and what final decision will be made by the firm.'
