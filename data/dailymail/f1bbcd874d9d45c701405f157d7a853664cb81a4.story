A care worker who was caught on camera hitting a disabled teenager on the back of the head has been jailed for six months.

Zak Rowlands, 19, who cannot speak and suffers with autism and severe learning difficulties, was assaulted and called a 'stupid boy' by Stanley Nkenka on his birthday.

When his parents noticed the vulnerable teenager was flinching, they set up a hidden camera at Oxen Barn Residential Home in Leyland, Lancashire, and captured Nkenka's abusive behaviour.

The care worker was seen hitting the vulnerable teenager, throwing him to the bed and calling him a 'stupid boy'.

Nkenka, 36, from Bolton, pleaded guilty at Preston Crown Court last month to ill-treatment of a person without mental capacity in the early hours of May 12.

The footage showed Nkenka bringing Mr Rowlands back to his bedroom after he wandered off during the night before hitting him.

As the youngster lay in darkness, he later approached him and quietly said: 'Do you want some more?' before he went on to strike him again on the back of the head on a separate occasion.

Zak Rowlands' father Paul (left) said Nkenka (right) has damaged the fragile trust they have in the care of their precious son 

Judge Christopher Cornwall said: 'The ill-treatment that is complained of seems to me to be dismissive of him as an individual, unkind and uncaring, and really disrespectful of him as a human being.

'Carers must know that if they fall so far below the standards that are expected of them to the extent that they ill-treat the people they care for, they must know they put their liberty at jeopardy.'

Oxen Barn - privately run by the Priory Group - is a specialist home for adults who have autistic spectrum disorders and severe learning difficulties.

Mr Rowlands' mother Julie said she felt 'sick, heartbroken and angry' when she saw the hidden camera footage.

'Sadly Zak, my loving, affectionate, special and incredibly vulnerable son hasn't the mental capacity to be able to speak but he communicates in his own way,' she told the court.

'By making sounds and by the sparkle in his eyes when he's happy and by the tears and the sorrow in his eyes when he's sad or hurt. But when that's not enough I am my son's voice and will always be until I take my last breath.

She said she knew something was wrong when her son started to flinch when he was touched or approached. 

'When I saw the video recording of Nkenka hitting him, I felt sick, heartbroken, angry and incredibly guilty,' she said.

'It's hard to articulate the actual words that really describe my emotions. I'm scared, really scared that it will happen again.'

'I have to trust the people that care for him because as much as I don't like it I haven't got a choice. We've been to look for other places closer to home so that I can keep a closer eye on him. I miss him so much but we can't find anywhere that is suitable.'

Her husband, Paul, said: 'Each day there is as good as it gets and the impact that you have on these vulnerable people and their families is immeasurable. 

'Whether it be a good one as is the case with many carers or a bad one as is the case with you. 

'You have damaged the fragile trust that we have in the care of our precious son and that damage can never be fully undone.'

Earlier this year, two care workers working for another Priory Group company in Bury were jailed for seven months after they were caught on a secret camera physically and verbally abusing a quadriplegic man.
