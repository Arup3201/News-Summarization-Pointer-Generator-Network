Queens Park Rangers owner Tony Fernandes has backed Adel Taarabt to prove he is capable of competing at the highest level of English football.

Taarabt, who has made two appearances for QPR so far this season, was omitted from Harry Redknapp's pre-season squad for their summer tour of the US - but has since managed to edge his way back into his manager's plans.

Fernandes believes Taarabt can replicate the form he had shown at Loftus Road before sealing consecutive loan moves to Fulham and AC Milan with the help of QPR's coaching staff.

The QPR owner has revealed that Glenn Hoddle has  taken it upon himself to keep a close eye on the Moroccan's development.

'Adel is a QPR enigma,' Fernandes told the Evening Standard. 'On his day he is the best, someone who can turn a game around. He has shown in the Championship what an amazing player he is.

'He has shown flashes of brilliance. Glenn Hoddle is very focused on Adel. He is a Glenn Hoddle player. He is flash, which Glenn was.

'Adel has got to get his head right. He saw my trainer about nutrition and he gave me a very good report on Adel. We are going to get a special nutritionist for him because he is like me. He eats all the wrong things at the wrong time.

'Adel sent me a text saying, "I want to show the world what I can do". Now he is focused on making it work at QPR. He is training hard. If we can get the best out of him, we are going to be the winners.'
