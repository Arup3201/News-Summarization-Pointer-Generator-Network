Tottenham striker Harry Kane deserves an England call-up to Roy Hodgson's senior squad, according to Clive Allen.

Kane has been in impressive form for Tottenham since the start of the season, scoring 12 goals in 21 games for the north London outfit.

And former Tottenham forward Allen believes he is ready to join the likes of Wayne Rooney, Gary Cahill and Joe Hart in the Three Lions' senior set up.

Allen, speaking to talkSPORT, said: 'He is doing everything he is capable of. Seeing him come in as a kid, you could see he had talent.

'He has got a magnificent attitude and there is no problem in terms of keeping his feet on the ground because he was really focused from a young age.

'He wasn’t overconfident, he worked really hard at his game, and he was able to deal with every level he played at. It is great to see a young English striker scoring goals in the Premier League. Harry is single-minded in the right way and I think it is fantastic.

'People are starting to talk about him making the England side. That would be a meteoric rise and it would be nothing more than he deserved because he has worked hard to get to where he is.'

Kane has scored eight goals in 10 games for England's Under 21 side.
