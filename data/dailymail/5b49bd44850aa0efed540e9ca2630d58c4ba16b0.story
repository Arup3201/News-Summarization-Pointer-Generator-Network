An American football fan is suing the NFL over claims that tickets for the Super Bowl in New Jersey next month are too expensive.

Lawyer Josh Finkelman bought two tickets for $2,000 each for the event on February 2, a price he alleges violates New Jersey's consumer fraud law.

The 28-year-old has argued that the state prohibits companies issuing tickets to withhold more than 5 per cent of available seating to the public.

Mr Finkelman has claimed that only 1 per cent, or 775 of the 77,500 tickets, have been made available at face value to the public, according to ABC News.

This means that fans are forced to turn to the secondary market to try to obtain tickets for the biggest event in American Football.

The price of tickets is already out of reach to most fans, with the average cost is $3,432.90 according to TiqIQ.

But according to Mr Finkelman's lawsuit, the price he paid was 'far in excess of the face value of the tickets'.

The Houston Texas fan claimed he was redirected to a secondary sales site when he visited the NFL website to buy his tickets.

'I believe they need to release the seats at face value. Weâ€™re the ones who support the team, who buy the jerseys. We should be able to go at a fair price,' he told the Daily News. 

Diane Sammons, an attorney for Mr Finkelman, said she hoped the lawsuit would force the NFL to comply with New Jersey law, but said it was unlikely that a court will hear the case before the Super Bowl is held.

The NFL told ESPN it was reviewing the lawsuit, but pointed out that 75 per cent of the tickets were given to teams, which sell them at face value to fans.

A statement from the NFL added that it 'would like for as many fans as possible to attend ... [but] we
 can never fulfill all the requests for tickets'.

The spokeswoman added: 'The NFL's Super Bowl 
ticket distribution process has been in existence for years and is well 
documented. We are confident it is in compliance with all applicable 
laws.'

According to the NFL every ticket distributed by the league is sold at face value. The NFL gives 75 per cent of tickets to the league's 30 teams, with 35 per cent going to the two teams that make it to the final.

Teams hold lotteries among their fans to distribute their tickets, but Ms Sammons claimed they often offer them in expensive packages, adding: 'The Super Bowl has become an event 
for the very wealthy.'

'The New Jersey statute was 
intended to stop that and to prevent all the profits to go to the 
secondary market, which is what is happening,' she said.

But TiqIQ's Chris Matcovich believes about 10 per cent of tickets will be sold at face value, and not 1 per cent like the lawsuit claims.

'The NFL isn't holding tickets back for the benefit of themselves, but for the teams and their fans,' he said.
