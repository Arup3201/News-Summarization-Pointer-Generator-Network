Former Bombers great Mark McVeigh took on a convincing nanna role of 'Spike Doubtfire' to get his own back with the younger players in the Essendon AFL side.

McVeigh, who retired two years ago at just 33 after 232 games, decided to get his own back with the young lads who used to give him grief about being one of the old boys in the club.

'I don't miss daily pre-season training or getting crunched every weekend – I do miss the camararderie though,' he said. 

'Getting around the boys after a win and having a laugh but by the end of my career I was the one copping - the youngsters were relentless about my age I reckon I owe a few of them a proper stitch up.'

McVeigh went all out even acquiring the expertise of drama coach who taught him how to shuffle with the support of a walking frame

He was also taught how to delicately hold a cup of tea and eat a biscuit

He was then given a complete makeover to be transformed into the ultimate nanna look.

Meet the ever-convincing Spike Doubtfire - ready for action

And that he did – McVeigh went all out even acquiring the expertise of drama coach who taught him hold to delicately hold a cup of tea and eat a biscuit – and of course the obligatory shuffling with the support of a walking frame.

He was then given a complete makeover to be transformed into the ultimate nanna look.

'The results were spectacular – I was a bonfide nanna, an ugly one, but a nanna all the same,' he said. 'Me and the nannas are going to rip this place up – I couldn't wait to stitch up young lads.'

Mrs Doubtfire travelled to the football club under the guise of being part of a documentary about a group of elderly supporters.

The stunned reaction by the players is hilarious and there is even talk of getting an ambulance when McVeigh reveals the true him

'The lads loved it but I needed to show that this old duck could still run rings around them,' McVeigh said

When Mrs Doubtfire and the rest of the group of mature fans met players Jason Winderlich, David Zaharakis and Dyson Heppell -she didn't waste any time in getting stuck in.

The players were explaining that when players first joined the club they had to do a lot of training sessions to put on size.

Mrs Doubtfire asks Zaharakis if he in his first year at the club.

Zaharakis corrects her saying he was in fact in his sixth year.

'Oh, I'm sorry,' Mrs Doubtfire replies. 'I just thought you look a bit skinny.'

Zaharakis and Dyson Heppell quietly express their surprise to each other by the comment.

Then the nannas all get rugged up and went out onto the field to watch the boys do a training drill when Winderlich, who was in on the practical joke, knocks poor Mrs Doutbfire to the ground. 

The stunned reaction by the players is hilarious and there is even talk of getting an ambulance when McVeigh reveals the true him.

'The lads loved it but I needed to show that this old duck could still run rings around them,' McVeigh said. 'What a day – this old duck needs a lie down and a cuppa.'
