A father-of-two 'methodically' stabbed his estranged wife to death in front of their two young sons after a chance encounter.

Nathaniel Brown, 27, was described as 'quiet, with a calm demeanour' as he repeatedly stabbed 24-year-old Zandra Maxwell-Nelson.

Brown was today jailed for a minimum of 21 years.

The victim and the killer's sister had taken their children for a picnic in a park before returning to the sister's north London home where Brown was waiting.

He had not seen his wife for more than a year on the day of the killing and was not apparently aware she and his sister were friends.

After 'blanking' his wife and sons, he walked inside the property and played with his sister's children.

He left, but then returned claiming he need to use the toilet. It was then he grabbed a kitchen knife and calmly began knifing his former partner.

There were as many as 20 stab wounds found on her body.

The onslaught continued even as she desperately climbed into a parked car, before the murderer dropped the blade in the street and took off his bloodstained shirt as he walked away.

Brown was convicted of murder following a two-week trial at the Old Bailey, after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Jailing him for life with a minimum term of 21 years, Judge Martin Stephens QC told Brown he was a 'controlling and possessive' individual who was unable to accept his wife and sister being friends.

'Nothing the court heard about you from doctors can begin to explain the savage, remitting attack you launched on a helpless woman, your wife, other than wilful anger,' the judge said.

'All this in the street, in front of your own and other people's children, and in the view of horrified neighbours.

'You were angry because your wife and sister were consorting together without your knowledge and approval.

The stabbing happened outside Brown's sister house on Durban Road in Tottenham

'The loss and suffering by your children, and your wife's mother and family, is unbearable for them.

'I'm prepared to accept you were facing personality problems throughout this time, but what you did could not be explained by mental abnormality.'

He added: 'This is the minimum term you can serve before you can even be considered for release on licence, and that will only ever happen if the parole board considers you are no longer a danger to the public.'

Brown, who sat in silence with his head bowed throughout the hearing and much of the trial, showed no emotion as the sentence was passed, while members of Ms Maxwell-Nelson's family yelled 'thank you' to the judge.

Jurors heard the couple had wed just months after meeting in early 2007 but had not seen each other for more than a year at the time of Ms Maxwell-Nelson's death.

She was killed after a chance
 encounter with his victim as Mr Brown waited for his sister outside her home in 
Durban Road, Tottenham, at around 6pm on April 20 last year.

Following a registry office ceremony, she soon became pregnant but suffered a miscarriage, before conceiving their first child later that year.

Just 18 days following the birth of Abraham on May 14, 2008, the young mother left Brown alone with his newborn son while she went to the toilet in the middle of the night.

She returned five minutes later to find the infant's eye was bloodshot, with Brown admitting he had slapped him to stop him crying.

Miss Maxwell-Nelson immediately moved out before reporting him to the police, the court heard.

Months later, in breach of his bail conditions, Brown turned up at her mother's house and hurled a brick through a kitchen window after she refused to speak to him.

An entry in Miss Maxwell-Nelson's diary from early 2008 also said her husband had pushed her into a hedge during a row.

She later agreed to see him, becoming pregnant with their second child, before permanently breaking off contact and filing for divorce in September 2010.

Describing the killing, Adrian Darbishire, prosecuting said: 'He ignored completely his wife and two young boys - he blanked them.

'The defendant went into the house, playing with his nephews and nieces, and after about 10 or 15 minutes came out of the house and walked away.

'He must have reflected on what he had seen, and after about 20 minutes he came back and told his sister he needed to use the toilet.'

Brown then headed into the house and grabbed a kitchen knife before emerging seconds later and beginning the brutal attack on his former partner.

'Altogether some 15 to 20 knife wounds were found on Zandra's body, particularly on the torso but also on the arms and other parts,' said Mr Darbishire.

'He stabbed her again and again and again.'

'Eyewitnesses described the defendant as remaining quiet, with a calm demeanour throughout the attack.

'He appeared to one to be "almost methodical".'

After handing himself in on the same day of the killing, Brown maintained that he could not remember the murder and argued at trial that he had been suffering from severe depression and narcissistic personality disorder, which affected his judgement.

But a consultant psychiatrist told jurors the jobless murderer was simply 'chronically unhappy' with his life - not depressed - and his state of mind could not explain the attack.

Brown, of no fixed address, denied murder, but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
