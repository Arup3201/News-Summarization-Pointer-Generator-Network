Having spent the last decade representing Holland on the field, Dirk Kuyt took to the sofa with three of his children  on Friday night to watch his country's 3-1 victory over Kazakhstan.

The former Liverpool frontman, who announced his retirement from international football last week, posed for a picture at the start of the match with his young trio decked out in 'Kuyt' shirts. 

The 34-year-old, now with Fenerbahce and living in Turkey, tweeted: 'Kuyt on the left, Kuyt on the right, Kuyt in front and back. Little change but now from Istanbul. Good luck guys!'

The Dutchman spent six years playing for Liverpool having joined the Reds from Feyenoord in 2006

Making his international debut in September 2004, Kuyt went on to earn 104 caps for the Oranje and played in last summer's World Cup in Brazil as Holland claimed third place.

Kuyt, who played for Utrecht and Feyenoord in his homeland before moving to the Premier League with Liverpool in 2006, represented his country at five major tournaments. 

The watching Kuyts will have been disappointed with the start Holland made to their European Championship qualifier as Kazakhstan - ranked 127th in the world - took the lead through defender Renat Abdulin who scored with a powerful 17th-minute header which cannoned in off the crossbar.

Holland had an anxious wait before eventually equalising through substitute Klaas-Jan Huntelaar on 62 minutes.

Ibrahim Afellay put the Dutch ahead on 82 minutes via a deflection before Manchester United striker made sure of the victory from the penalty spot in the last minute of normal time.
