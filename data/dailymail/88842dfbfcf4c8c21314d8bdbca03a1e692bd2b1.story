Manchester United defender Phil Jones is expected to meet with the club's medical staff on Tuesday as the Red Devils wait to discover the extent of the injury he sustained on England duty.

Jones limped off in the 77th minute of Monday's 2-0 Euro 2016 qualifying victory in Switzerland due to what appeared to be hamstring problem.

No confirmation has been forthcoming from the Football Association on the matter and United will be eager to assess the 22-year-old when he arrives back in Manchester.

The Old Trafford outfit, without a win to their name yet this season after four matches in all competitions under new boss Louis van Gaal, are next in action when they host QPR in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday.

Several United players could make debuts in the match, including Jones' fellow England defender Luke Shaw, who it is understood is now fit and ready for selection.

Left-back Shaw has been unable to make a competitive appearance for his new side following a summer switch from Southampton having suffered a hamstring injury of his own in August.

There could also be United bows on Sunday for another defender in Marcos Rojo, with the necessary paperwork for him to do so now signed off, plus the versatile Daley Blind and striker Radamel Falcao, the two transfer deadline day recruits.

Meanwhile, Ander Herrera, who arrived from Athletic Bilbao over the summer, is hopeful of making his comeback in the game.

The midfielder has been restricted to just one competitive United run-out so far because of an ankle complaint, but wrote on Twitter on Monday: 'Training hard and looking forward to this next game at Old Trafford!'

There could also be a home Red Devils debut for Angel di Maria, the winger the club broke the British transfer record to sign last month.

United striker Robin van Persie is keen to get back working among the new signings once he finishes his international duties this week with Holland.

Speaking in the Austrian Alps, where the Dutch team have been training, 31-year-old Van Persie - who has also expressed his desire to play at the 2018 World Cup and keep his career going through to the age of 40 - said: 'I can't wait to go and train and play with the world class players we have signed - wow!

'That feeling, that we are going to perform well, has only got stronger after the buying of players over the last weeks. I find it very exciting, the arrival of all those new players.

'For me personally, it's brilliant to go and play with some of the best players in the world. It's great that I can go and train and play with them every day.'

United wide man Ashley Young is also convinced the future is bright for the club.

'I definitely think things are going to turn for us and I would say to the fans there is nothing to worry about, we're going to come good,' Young told Inside United magazine.

'It's just like the manager has said, just believe in the philosophy and how we're playing and keep believing that we're going to turn this round because we do.'

Sir Bobby Charlton has echoed the sentiment that United supporters should not be too fearful about what lies ahead.

'We've got nothing to worry about,' said the club's all-time leading goalscorer, quoted by the Manchester Evening News.

'He's got the world at his feet, the new manager.

'What we need to do now is put the players in the right places and the ball in the right place. But that's harder than it sounds.'
