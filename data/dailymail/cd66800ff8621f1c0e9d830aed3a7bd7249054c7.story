Roberto Mancini is still without a win since returning to Inter Milan after they slumped to a shock 2-1 home defeat by Udinese.

Mauro Icardi's first half effort appeared to have set the hosts on their way to victory but goals from Bruno Fernandes and Cyril Thereau meant Mancini's winless run continued.

When Inter won the Scudetto in the 2006-07 season under Mancini, they lost only one league game all season, but they have already lost two out of three since his return.

Inter dominated the opening half of play against Udinese, whose coach Andrea Stramaccioni was facing his former club for the first time, but had only a Icardi goal to show for it.

Bruno Fernandes levelled with a superb strike from just outside the box in the 60th minute and Cyril Thereau scored the winner 11 minutes later.

The French forward took advantage of a mis-judged backward pass by Rodrigo Palacio, rounded Samir Handanovic and easily scored into the empty net.

'I'm not sure what happened in between halves,' Mancini, whose side are languishing in 12th place with 17 points, told Sky Sports Italia.

'I haven't had enough time to reflect on it. After Udinese tied the score we stopped being a team. I'm extremely disappointed.'
