He is typically a stoic Commander-in-Chief.

But now, Barack Obama's former top adviser has revealed in a new book what happens when the President loses his famous cool.

David Axelrod,  Obama's top strategist during his 2012 presidential campaign, claims the 53-year-old once cussed at him in front of others and stormed out of a debate-prep session in a fit of rage. 

In his book, 'Believer: My Forty Years in Politics', he describes how he attempted to offer Obama some constructive criticism prior to his first debate with Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.

However, Obama refused to accept his advice, Axelrod writes.

Instead, in an unexpected move, the US leader reportedly exclaimed: 'Motherf****r's never happy!' before storming out of the room in front of stunned onlookers, according to Business Insider.  

'That was a first,' Axelrod says in his book. 'Obama and I had been working together for a decade, through some pretty hairy moments, but he had never before lost his temper in this fashion.'

He added: 'He certainly never attacked me so harshly, especially in front of others.'

And perhaps Obama could have done with heeding Axelrod's advice - as his first debate proved to be disastrous, with 67 per cent of viewers declaring that Romney had won it, according to a poll.

Only 25 per cent said the same of the President, whose poor performance was watched by more than 60million Americans in October 2012, the poll by CNN/Opinion Research revealed.

Revelations: 'Obama and I had been working together for a decade, through some pretty hairy moments, but he had never before lost his temper in this fashion,' Axelrod writes in his book (right), 'Believer: My Forty Years in Politics', published last Tuesday.

In his book, Axelrod theorizes that Obama's loss of temper and reference to him as a 'Motherf****r' was actually down to the politician's frustrations with his own insufficient pre-debate preparation.

'My sense was that the president knew he wasn't ready,' he writes. 'His mind-set, his reluctance to embrace the game, had been wrongheaded from the start, and now it was clearly hurting him.'

Ultimately, Obama went on to be re-elected President in November 2012, defeating Romney 51.1percent to 47.2percent.

He was sworn into the Oval Office for a second term on January 20, 2013.

It is not the first time Obama has apparently lost his renowned cool.

In 2012, the President failed to keep his temper under control in Connecticut after hecklers interrupted a speech he was giving at a rally in Bridgeport and began chanting at him. 

Astonished attendees watched as Obama halted his own speech to address the hecklers, who are believed to have been activists seeking more global AIDS funding.

'Excuse me, excuse me,' he said repeatedly, trying to speak over the crowd.

When the hecklers kept chanting, Obama fell silent for several seconds, looking visibly angry and raising one hand in frustration as the crowd began to boo around him.

'Let me just say this,' he said, addressing the hecklers. 'You've been appearing at every rally we've been doing. 'We're funding global AIDS. And the other [Republican] side is not.'

'So I don't know why you think this is a useful strategy to take,' he finished, jabbing his finger angrily in the direction of the hecklers. The crowd's boos turned to cheers as Obama spoke.

'So, what we would suggest,' he added, 'I think it would make a lot more sense for you guys to go to the folks who aren't interested in funding global AIDS and shout at that rally. Because we're trying to focus on figuring out how to finance the things that you want financed.'

Then he turned to another group of hecklers on his other side, adding: 'You guys same thing.' As more chants filled the rally, he said: 'Alright, you guys have made your point, now let's go.'

Fighting to regain the momentum of the rally, he held his hands up saying: 'Everybody - we're alright. 'Come on guys,' he said.

He then fell silent again, watching with pursed lips as the crowd booed the hecklers once more. The President waited nearly 20 seconds for the noise to stop.

Then, he attempted again to continue with his speech. But he was forced to wait in silence for another 20 seconds before finally saying: 'Hey! Listen up everybody!'  

Mr Obama finally regained control of the rally and continued with his speech. 

Believer: My Forty Years in Politics was published last Tuesday by Penguin Press.
