An ex-policeman and former director of the Great Yorkshire Show was jailed for two-and-a-half years today after he admitted filming a man having sex with a pony.

Charles Littleboy, 55, made the video in his stables while the man was supposedly taking part in an animal breeding practical course, Teesside Crown Court heard.

Police discovered the video along with a stash of images of horrific sexual abuse of young boys on two computers at Littleboy’s home in Howe, Thirsk, North Yorkshire.

He pleaded guilty last month to 11 counts of making indecent images of children, four counts of distributing indecent images of children, five counts of possessing extreme pornographic images and one count of possessing 3,904 indecent photographs of children.

Some of the extreme pornography related to bestiality - including the material he filmed consensually at his property, the court heard. Other images concerned sexual mutilation of men.

The film with the male pony was made a number of years ago while the man stayed at his home, Shaun Dodds, prosecuting, said.

Another film police found involved the same man having sex with a dog, the police said.

Simon Reevell, defending, said Littleboy did not coerce the man to have sex with the pony.

'Although it is a difficult and unpleasant thought, there was a willingness on the part of both of them,” he said.

Over six years until 2010, Littleboy downloaded images of child abuse from the internet and engaged in depraved discussions with fellow paedophiles, the court heard.

In one conversation read out by the prosecution, Littleboy discussed sexually abusing a baby with a writer known as Pervy Dwain.

Littleboy had asked: 'Tell me what you would do to a young one and how sick you would like it to be.'

The indecent images found on his computer included an image of a baby around three months old being abused.

Other pictures involved boys aged as young as four, and clearly showed distress. One male child was gagged and bound, the court heard.

Mr Reevell said his client was a shy and private man who now faced 'utter humiliation'.

He passed a number of references up to Judge Peter Fox, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, saying: “They speak of a man wholly removed from these offences.'

Mr Reevell said Littleboy cared for his parents, who are aged 84 and 79.

Judge Fox accepted Littleboy’s reputation was ruined, but he added: 'What you fail at present to appreciate is the utter humiliation and degradation of the victims of your crimes, both human and animal.'

He jailed Littleboy for two-and-a-half years, put him on the Sex Offenders’ Register for life and banned him from unsupervised contact with children.

Littleboy is a former director of the Yorkshire Agricultural Society, which organises the Great Yorkshire Show, and an ex-member of the British Potato Council.

He was also a police officer with North Yorkshire Police in the 1980s.
