A popular Chinese reality television show featuring celebrities paired with animals has been criticised by animal rights activists for its 'cruel' tasks.

Hunan TV Station's animal reality show 'Wonderful Friends' - where stars perform tasks with animals in a south China zoo - became an instant hit when 20 million people tuned into the first episode.

But the weekly show, which saw a chimpanzee start throwing things and in clear distress when separated from his son, has caused uproar amongst animal rights groups.

An elephant is given a pedicure by Chinese actor Huang Xuan and a chimpanzee is forced to wear a Superman costume, in some of the show's more unusual scenes, dubbed 'cruel' by experts talking to People's Daily Online. 

Wildlife experts argue the programme is exploiting the animals, with many reacting in ways that show they are stressed.

One expert, Miss Jiao, said that people are mistaking the creature's distressed reactions as cute. For example, a chimpanzee that appears to be 'grinning' is actually showing signs of of 'anxiety, fear and threat'.

Pictures which show a young orangutan being dressed in human clothes could lead to alienation with other orangutans likely to ignore it, she warned. 

One part of the show saw a celebrity taking a young chimpanzee to 'Find its Father' which led to the father suddenly becoming emotional and violent. 

The creatures are known to chase, stomp and bite unknown chimpanzees or even commit infanticide, leading to worries about the impact the tasks are having on the wild animals.

Producers have also been accused of courting disaster by placing potentially dangerous animals including lions, elephants and zebras alongside inexperienced celebrity zookeepers.

Chang Jiwen, deputy head of the Development Research Centre of Resources and Environmental Policy Institute, said animals should not be used for the sake of entertainment and called for tougher legislation. 'We cannot use our emotions to design and manipulate the animals, animals are not there to be harassed for the entertainment of people,' he said. 'We should not start from the emotional needs of ourselves or for effect or for ratings of the show to interfere with the lives of animals.

'When they see these strangers, they might become afraid and take action because of the stress, which is very dangerous to human beings,' said wildlife activist Wang Hui, from Animals Asia, a Hong Kong-based campaigning group.

She complained animals were being forced to live side-by-side with those from different continents with how orangutans, which are native to South-east Asia, put next to baby chimpanzees, which hail from Africa.

She said there would be little left of the show if the inappropriate parts were lost and was particularly concerned about the unnatural and stressful tasks for the creatures such as making lions socialise with celebrities and having chimpanzees go clothes shopping.

Critics also argue it is setting a bad example when in January, the State Forestry Administration issued a notice, forbidding tourists to have close contact with endangered wild animals.

It follows a trip by the Duke of Cambridge to China earlier this month where he wanted to highlight the fight to conserve and save endangered species in the country.

But the makers of the show hit back, saying it was fully complicit with the laws of the State

A spokesman said: 'We strictly abide by all laws and regulations set out by the State. 

'Contact with the animals is a serious issue and when we were creating the show, we did so with the knowledge of the laws and regulations.'

It went on to say that the regulations set by the State Forestry Administration were referring to 'rare and endangered wild animals'.
