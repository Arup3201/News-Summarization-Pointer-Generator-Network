Police have released CCTV footage of a man who attacked and sexually assaulted two women on their way to work in the middle of a busy street. 

The unidentified attacker is seen on CCTV stalking both women before racing up behind them and dragging them to the ground. 

The first attack happened on Sunday December 22, 2013 at 6.23am near the Hilton Hotel in Deansgate, Manchester.

The first victim is seen walking to work without realising the stalker was following right behind her

Detectives hope some of the people driving past may recognise the attacker responsible for the assaults

The 26-year-old woman was dragged to the ground by the attacker, who tried to forcibly remove her clothes. 

The woman was walking to work at 6.23am and was on the phone to her boyfriend when the attacker struck. 

The victim managed to fight off the man who fled the scene on foot. 

The woman reported the attempted rape to Greater Manchester Police.

Fortunately, she was not physically injured as a result of her ordeal.

The first victim is seen walking up a flight of steps near the Hilton Hotel in Deansgate, Manchester

The 26-year-old victim is unaware that  a stalker is just ten feet behind her as she walks to work

The attacker closes in on the woman who is talking to her boyfriend on the phone as he creeps up on her

In the meantime, the man is believed to have returned home and changed his clothes before looking for a new victim.  

Shortly afterwards, the man pounced on a second woman who was also walking to work through Manchester City Centre. 

The 32-year-old woman as also in the Deansgate area of the city when the man approached her from behind and dragged her to the ground. 

He then tried to force himself on top of the screaming woman. A passer-by heard the terrified woman and the attacker ran off towards the Castlefields area of the city.

The second woman, pictured, is also on her way to work in the Deansgate area of Manchester when attacked

Again the attacker keeps his head bowed as he closes in on his second victim, after changing his clothes 

Detective Constable Adam Cronshaw, said: 'Two women were followed and pounced upon by, who we now believe to be the same offender.

'We believe the motive in both incidents was sexual but thankfully neither woman was subjected to a serious sexual assault.

'Given the proximity and timing of both offences it is possible that he has a vehicle or residence nearby which has enabled him to change his clothing.

'We have been making inquiries and efforts to trace this man since the incidents and have previously released a still image of the offender through the media.'

The women were both attacked within a short distance of each other on the morning of December 23, 2013

Detective Constable Cronshaw said: 'We are now releasing the moving footage to highlight his deliberate stalking of the women with a view to encouraging anyone with information to come forward.

'We have managed to capture his movements and face from a number of angles so I am also hopeful someone will recognise him from this.

'I would like to appeal to the public to think back to three days before Christmas: were you out on the Saturday night into the Sunday morning, perhaps on a works Christmas party?

'From viewing the footage this suspect appears to be drunk so I would ask people whether they were with him during a party or night out in or close to the city centre.

'Any information will be treated in strict confidence.'

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

In the grainy footage, the man can be seen closing in on the 32-year-old woman despite passing cars

As she crossed the road, the attacker struck, pulling the terrified woman to the ground before running off

The man spotted his first victim in Deansgate, Manchester city centre on December 23, 2013 at 6.23am 

By the time of the second attack, the man, pictured, has changed his top before searching for a second victim
