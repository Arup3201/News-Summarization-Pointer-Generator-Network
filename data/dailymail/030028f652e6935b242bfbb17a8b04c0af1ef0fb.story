This weekend's Ryder Cup will be hotly contested between team Europe and team USA. And when it comes to the style stakes, the wives and girlfriends of the golfers take matters just as seriously.  

The women demonstrated their fashion credentials as they arrived in Scotland this week and pulled out the stops for the  Team Gala Dinner  in Auchterarder.

Preparing for the swanky event at the Gleneagles Hotel, Perthsire, Scotland there wasn't a hint of a dodgy boob job or tacky hair extensions as we're so used to with footballers' wives.

The GWAGs wore elegant peplum dresses, floor length cowl neck gowns and beautiful sequined cocktail dresses.

Pink lady: Sergio Garcia of Team Europe and his partner Katharina Boehm, who is also a keen golfer in her native Germany

Angelic: Kate Rose wore a long white gown as she posed with husband Justin

Mother-of-two Kate Rose led the way in a figure hugging white dress, accessorised with a bright blue clutch as she accompanied her husband Justin to the event.

The 35-year-old former gymnast married Justin in 2006 and they have two children together, toddlers Leo, four, and Lottie, two.

She works with her husband on the Kate and Justin Rose Foundation and the pair split their time between England and Florida depending on Justin's tour schedule.

Champion Spanish golfer Sergio Garcia and his girlfriend Katharina also made for a dashing pair as she opted for a bright pink peplum dress with a silver clutch and heeled sandals.

Katharina is a keen golfer herself, having been the Bavarian Junior Girls Champion and coming 24th at the European Ladies Championship. But it seems she's happy to take a sidestep for her boyfriend though, having served as his caddy.

Going for gold: Europe team vice captain Miguel Angel Jiminez and his wife Suzanne couldn't have looked happier as they posed for photos before the dinner 

Having fun: The pair, who wed earlier this year, larked around for photographers, no mean feat in a pair of gold stiletto sandals

Pernilla Bjorn, wife of Thomas Bjorn, wore an unusual cut out layered green dress with a large gold cuff.

She married her man in 1998 and raises their three children in Gothenburg, Sweden. 

The menu for the prestigious dinner included a Perthshire salmon terrine served with whiskey chutney and Scottish honey and Arran mustard followed by a rack of slow cooked Aberdeenshire lamb. 

It seemed as though Europe's vice captain Miguel Angel Jimenez wanted to get some exercise before tucking in, dancing about with his new wife Suzanne in front of photographers. 

The Spaniard married the Austrian beauty  at the Golf Academy Miguel Angel Jimenez near Malaga in May.

Man of the hour: Ian Poulter of Europe and his wife Katie, who wears a deep blue dress with a sweetheart neckline

Maternity chic: Europe's Henrik Stenson with his heavily pregnant wife Emma in a flattering lace dress

Despite being known for occasional outbursts on the golf course, Ian Poulter looked like a dapper gentleman next to wife Kate who wore a deep blue floor length dress with a sweetheart neckline which perfectly framed her necklace.

The pair first met while he was working his way up to attaining his European Tour card. The former nurse married Ian in 2007 and they recently welcomed their fourth child.

Meanwhile Sweden's stylish couple Henrik and Emma Stenson perfectly complemented each other. Emma opted for a burgundy lace dress with long sleeves which showed off her burgeoning baby bump.

The couple already have two children, seven-year-old Lisa and their four-year-old son Karl.

Expanding family: Henrik and Emma were together for ten years before they got married in 2006

Henrik and Emma Stenson first met at the University of South California where they were both studying but wed in Dubai in 2006. 

While her husband's golfing credentials are impressive, having spent over 100 weeks ranked in the World top ten, Emma is also sporty, having been a keen alpine skier before also focussing on golf.

It was the couple's shared love of golf that he says drew them together and Henrik describes Emma as "very talented" on his website as well as describing the various hobbies the active pair enjoy such as skiing and snorkelling.

Dapper: Europe team captain Paul McGinley and his wife Alison, who wears an encrusted collared black shift dress 

His and hers in black: Jamie Donaldson of Europe and his partner Kathryn Tagg in a lacy black dress

Henrik and Emma aren't the only sporty couple in this year's European entourage, with team captain Paul McGinley and wife Alison being equally golf-mad. 

Alison boasts having played for England and on the Ladies European Tour while her husband also plays association football but now raises their three children in Sunningdale, England. She was on hand at the airport to help welcome team USA, alongside her husband and Shona Robison, Scotland's Minister for Sport.

Alison wore a jewel encrusted collared black shift dress while Jamie Donaldson's partner Kathryn Tagg also played it safe in a black long-sleeved lace outfit.

Though all of the GWAGs loOked glamorous for the gala dinner, don't for one minute think that they are just a group of pretty faces, as many of them carry out charitable work for The Wives' Association which carries out a range of charity work across the country: visiting hospitals and hospices, working with disadvantaged children and families.

One former GWAG notably absent from the line up is Caroline Wozniacki - the Danish tennis pro and former fiance of Rory McIIroy.

Open winner Rory  is now reportedly dating a 'travel sized' model from near his hometown.

It emerged  that he has been seeing 23-year-old receptionist Sasha Gale, who is from Lisburn, County Antrim, a city just the other side of Belfast from where he grew up. 

His meal with Miss Gale, who says online she likes 'fashion, whiskey, sunshine, travelling and fast cars', has buried rumours he was dating model Nadia Forde.

McIlroy, of Holywood, County Down, broke off his engagement from Danish sports star Wozniacki, 24, in May, just days after the couple had sent out their wedding invitations.

In what some interpreted as a dig at her former fiance, the tennis player recently wrote online: 'It's been three years since I have worn high heels on a normal day out. #feelsgood #looksgood #shopping #highheels'.

By the time the Ryder Cup gets into full swing this week, Gleneagles will have spent 13 years and £20m on staging its finest hour.

As the eyes of the sporting world fix firmly on this jewel of the Perthshire countryside, experts predict a flood of golf-mad tourists will pump more than £100m into the national economy as they flock to watch the world’s top golfers do battle.

Residents in nearby Auchterarder are determined to get their slice of the action when 250,000 fans arrive for the biennial clash between Europe and the US.

About 45,000 spectators are expected every day as US captain Tom Watson’s stars take on Paul McGinley’s European team this weekend. The event will put Scotland in the world’s shop window, as an estimated 500million viewers in 183 countries watch on TV.
