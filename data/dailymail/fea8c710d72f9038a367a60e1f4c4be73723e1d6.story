Mourners paid tribute to a popular 20-year-old man, who loved wearing his onesie, by donning the all-in-one jumpsuit at his memorial service.

Jamie Lawrence, who had been preparing for an 
interview to rejoin the army after being discharged two years ago on 
medical grounds, died suddenly at his home almost a fortnight ago.

At his funeral on Thursday, more than 
500 people gathered at a packed York church wearing their own versions 
of the jumpsuit as a tribute to Jamie - who loved his onesie so much he 
even wore it to eat his Christmas dinner.

On Saturday, MailOnline reported how Kelly and Stuart Scott were the first couple in Britain to get married wearing babygrow-style suits.

Jamie Lawrence loved wearing his onesie and had hopes to rejoin the army this later this year

Family and friends of Jamie Lawrence spent more than £450 on onesies to be worn at his funeral

Jamie’s mother, Lin Lawrence, 53, said: 'He loved his onesie and he never had it off since trying one on a year ago.

'I
think he just found them so comfortable and so he wore his to the pub, 
when he went shopping and even to a party on New Year’s Eve,' she said.

'There
were almost 550 people who attended the service on Thursday and nearly 
all of them wore onesies in his honour. He would have been really 
touched.'

Jamie’s sister, Emma Smith, 24, who 
works as an accounts manager at a bank after spending four years in the 
army, ordered £450 worth of onesies for people to wear at Jamie’s 
funeral.

'I couldn’t believe how up for it everyone was. It’s such a lovely tribute to pay to Jamie and it really meant a lot to the family. They all sold out straight away,' she said.

'The fact there were so many people at the funeral, with scores having to stand throughout, helped make the day easier for us.

'We always knew Jamie was so popular but we didn’t realise just how much.'

His mother, Lin, a support worker, said: 'Jamie was a typical young lad. He loved being with his mates and he was football mad.

Jamie Lawrence's friend Martin Stone, his mother Linda Lawrence, his sister Emma Smith, his girlfriend Laura Hare and friend Brad Rowle all donned onesies as a tribute

'He was outgoing and was the life and soul of a party. He was well-mannered and just a lovely person.

'For us this was reflected in terms of how many people came to pay their respects.

'For the wake, the pub had to put up a marquee to fit everyone in and even that wasn’t big enough.'

Jamie, who was due to start a new job as a landscape gardener just a week after he died, had an interview on February 14 to rejoin the army after he was discharged on medical grounds two years ago.

After recovering from Raynaud’s Disease, a common condition which affected the blood supply to his fingers and toes, Jamie hoped to pursue his career in the army.

He had spent over two years in the army before he was discharged after following in his father’s footsteps.

Jamie’s father Joe, 52, who spent 22 years in the army before retiring as a prison officer, said: 'He loved being in the army. He was very social and made friends easily and for him, he just loved being with the lads.'

Jamie, who was a lifelong supporter of Manchester United, played football for his local pub, the Half Moon, where the wake was held.

More than 500 mourners wore romper suits to the funeral of Jamie Lawrence, who loved to wear a onesie

'He always played in his number seven shirt and a lot of people had it printed on their onesies at the funeral,' his father said.

'The manager of the team has said he’s retiring the shirt as a tribute to Jamie and will hang it on the wall of the pub.

'I’d like to say a huge thank you to everyone who came. This tragic event has been made easier by their support.'

One of his onesies was worn at his funeral by his girlfriend Laura Hare, who had been in a relationship with Jamie for seven years.

Laura, 20, who is studying at university, said: 'Jamie was always so happy and so I think this is a very fitting tribute to him.

'We spent so much time together and often he’d be in his onesie so it’s a great way to remember him.'

Jamie’s death was not suspicious and an inquest has opened and adjourned.

Emma told the congregation at St Wilfrid’s Garrison Church: 'He was found by mum and dad in his bedroom. We will never know what happened that night, but Jamie never meant this. He wouldn’t have done this to us.

'He wasn’t depressed. He had a beautiful girlfriend that adored him. I am proud to have been his big sister.'

Jamie was laid to rest wearing his blue onesie, along with the ashes of his beloved dog, Taz, his football boots, photographs and letters from friends.

Emma is going to take part in the Great North Run as a tribute to Jamie. She has already raised £1,100 from money donated at his funeral, which she is donating to Help For Heroes.
