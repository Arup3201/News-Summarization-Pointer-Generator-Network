Concern: The report reveals how the number of cases of diabetes being treated in the UK has more than doubled in the last 20 years

One adult in ten has diabetes in some areas of the country, a report reveals today.

The number of cases being diagnosed has more than  doubled in the last 20 years, largely due to rising obesity.

The borough of Brent in North London has the highest rate, with 10.5 per cent of adults known to have diabetes, the figures show.

In Newham, East London, 9.9  per cent of adults are sufferers, with  9.6 per cent in Wolverhampton  and 9.4 per cent in Harrow, North London.

In Sandwell, West Midlands, the rate is 9.4 per cent and in Leicester it is 9.3 per cent.

The report by Diabetes UK predicts that by 2020, 1 in 12 children will have diabetes. Presently 7.4 per cent of under-16s are diagnosed, but this is set to rise to 8.4 per cent.

There are 2.9million adults and children with diabetes in the UK. Of those, 90 per cent have type 2, which is usually triggered by obesity.

The charity estimates at least another 850,000 people have the condition but do not yet know it. 

Many of the worst-hit areas have large South Asian populations. This group – which includes those from India, Pakistan, Nepal and Afghanistan – is six times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.

Scientists believe this is partly down to a genetic difference that means their muscles do not burn fat well. Traditional cooking methods using oil, creamed coconut milk and a high-fat butter called ghee may also play a role.

Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: ‘It is truly alarming that there is now somewhere in England where more than one in ten of the people have diabetes.

‘Given that the increase in cases is mainly due to a sharp rise in type 2 diabetes, the only way we will finally bring the increase under control is by getting much better at preventing cases of type 2. 

Growing problem: The steady increase of diabetes sufferers has been linked to rising obesity rates

‘A vital first step is to ensure that people realise how serious it is and understand their own personal risk so if they are at high risk they can make the simple lifestyle changes that can help prevent it.

‘If people are overweight, have a large waist or are over 40, they need to get a risk assessment, as should people who have a family history of diabetes or are South Asian and over 25.’ 

The charity urged adults at high risk to speak to their GP or pharmacist for advice.

Diabetes occurs when the body cannot break sugar down into energy. This happens when the hormone insulin does not work properly or the body does not make enough of it.

Symptoms include thirst, tiredness, weight loss and constantly needing to go to the toilet. There is no cure, but it can be treated by tablets, insulin injections or, for mild type 2, by a change of diet.

They're seen as a naughty treat for a sweet tooth,  but Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts, at 7g of sugar each, look saintly next to some ‘healthier’ offerings, researchers say.

A large Costa Coffee red berry fruit cooler drink has almost 14 times more sugar, at 97.1g – or 24 teaspoons. 

A large Starbucks coffee Frappuccino – without whipped cream – has 61.6g of sugar, as much as nine doughnuts. Glaceau large vitamin water has 15g. 

Even a ‘skinny’ Starbucks lemon and poppyseed muffin has 44.4g of sugar, while Pret A Manger’s Bircher muesli has 32.7g.

Credit Suisse carried out the sugar consumption study. The recommended daily amount is 90g for women, 120g for men.
