A
 former Blue Angels commander's tenure was so bizarre and juvenile that he went so far as to encourage his team to paint genitalia large enough to be visible by Google Maps, according to a Navy report recently made public.

Capt.
 Gregory McWherter was found to have 'witnessed, accepted, and encouraged behavior that, while 
juvenile and sophomoric in the beginning, ultimately and in the 
aggregate, became destructive, toxic, and hostile,' the report states.

Slate reports that McWherter created an environment hostile not only towards women (there has never been a female Blue Angel) but also to the man under his command, forcing them to constantly discuss their sex lives in front of one another.

A Navy report says former Blue Angels Commander Capt. Gregory McWherter 'encouraged behavior that, while juvenile and sophomoric in the beginning, ultimately and in the aggregate, became destructive, toxic, and hostile'

Punished: Capt. Greg McWherter, left, ex-commanding officer of the U.S. Navy flight demonstration squadron, the Blue Angels, received a letter of reprimand for allowing sexual harassment in the workplace during his time as leader of the flying team

'[Redacted] would frequently use his phone to show pictures of his girlfriends to other officers in the Ready Room,' the report reads. 'CAPT McWherter would actively participate in these conversations, would view the pictures, and when [redacted] would go for a period without offering up the pictures, CAPT McWherter would request them out loud in front of everyone.'

The report added that some of these photos included nudity and that 'joking or banter' about the women would inevitably occur once the picture was shown.

In another incident shortly before Halloween 2011, an unidentified person invited his girlfriend annd two others to his house to carve pumpkins.

'Prior to arrival of [redacted] and her boyfriend, [redacted] downloaded pornographic pumpkin carving stencils, also known as 'pornkins,'' the report read. 'The couples carved two pumpkins that night, each containing a separate pornographic image.

'On a subsequent workday, [redacted] brought the pumpkins into work and placed them in the Ready Room next to Blue Angels memorabilia.'

Ousted: McWherter was relieved in April from his post amid the allegations during his second stint as the Blue Angels' leader from May 2011 to November 2012

And in perhaps the most juvenile display, under the Captain's command a blue and gold penis 'was visible from satellite imagery.'

'[Redacted] brought paint with his own money and painted over the penis,' the report read. ' This blue and gold penis existed through the end of the 2012 airshow season. The penis is no longer visible on Google Maps.'

This sort of behavior was par for course under McWherter, was often part of conversations including 'crass or offensive terms' such as 'she can sit on my face.'

Group communication tool GroupMe was also often said to include pornographic images, 'often of male genitalia.'

In June, McWherter was found guilty of violating two articles under the 
military's code of justice during nonjudicial proceedings convened in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

The articles were failure to obey an order or regulation and conduct unbecoming of an officer by fostering a hostile command climate and failing to stop 'obvious and repeated instances of sexual harassment, condoning widespread lewd practices within the squadron and engaging in inappropriate and unprofessional discussions with his junior officers,' the Navy said in a statement.

He will be given a letter of reprimand that will go in McWherter's permanent file and is widely seen as a career-ender in the service.

According to the Navy's 63-page report obtained by Washington Post, newly hired pilots were hazed by being forced to wear 'foam penis' hats.

Crew members also kept binoculars in the cockpits to help them spot scantily-clad women in air show crowds.

The report stated McWherter, whose call sign was 'Stiffy,' encouraged a sex-obsessed environment more common in a fraternity house than a flight team.

McWherter was relieved in April from his duty as executive officer of Naval Base Coronado in California amid the allegations during his second stint as the Blue Angels' leader from May 2011 to November 2012.Â 

The Navy said it did not find problems during his first stint as the flying team's commanding officer from 2008 to 2010.

'The investigation concluded that McWherter witnessed, condoned, and encouraged behavior that, while juvenile and sophomoric in the beginning, ultimately and in the aggregate, became destructive, toxic, and hostile,' the Navy said in a statement.

The Navy said investigators found no evidence the behavior led to sexual assault.

Harry Harris Jr., commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, ordered the investigation after a service member filed an official complaint with the Navy on March 24.

The Blue Angels' mission is to publicly represent the best of Naval Aviation and Harris said 'the actions of Captain McWherter jeopardized that mission.'

'Commanding officers have an enduring obligation to maintain a proper work environment at all times and in all places and spaces; and they will be held accountable as appropriate when they fail,' Harris said.

Several junior personnel who served under McWherter received formal written counseling for their behavior, but McWherter was held accountable for the actions of those in his command, the Navy said.

The Blue Angels are reviewing procedures, said Vice Adm. David Buss, commander, Naval Air Force Pacific, and its new commanding officer, Thomas Frosch, started implementing measures to clean up the workplace.

McWherter also was president of the Tailhook Association for about eight months before he resigned amid the probe.

The San Diego-based nonprofit aviator fraternity said it knew nothing of the allegations against McWherter.

The group dealt with its own scandal in 1991 when Navy pilots at its Las Vegas convention were accused of sexually abusing female officers.

McWherter, a graduate of the Citadel military college in South Carolina, served in the Mediterranean, Persian Gulf and western Pacific, and was an instructor at the famed Top Gun school.
