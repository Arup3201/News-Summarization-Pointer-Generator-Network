The Copa del Rey final is making headlines in Spain as the venue of the prestigious fixture has still yet to be confirmed.

Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona will battle it out to win the Spanish cup competition however the duo want the final to be held in different locations.

Barcelona have their heart set on the May 29 final taking place at Valencia's Mestalla Stadium whereas Athletic have said it should be held in Seville.

Spanish newspapers Mundo Deportivo and Sport also report on where the Copa del Rey final could be held

Real Madrid, according to AS, have told the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) that they will not host the Copa del Rey final.

The Spanish giants hosted the final, which has been held in a number of different locations over the past few years, in 2013 and are against holding the event once again.

An AC/DC means the final cannot be held at either Vicente Calderon or Espanyol's Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys, leaving the RFEF short of options ahead of the final.

Elsewhere in Spain, Marca report on former Osasuna president Miguel Archanco's arrest over the whereabouts of £1.7million which was taken out of the club's accounts.
