Jasvir Ginday, 29, has been found guilty of murdering his wife Varkha after she threatened to 'out him' as gay

A gay bank worker who strangled his new bride with a hoover pipe and burnt her body in an incinerator after she threatened to 'out him' was today found guilty of murder and jailed for life.

Jasvir Ram Ginday killed 24-year-old Varkha Rani in September last year following a lavish wedding ceremony in India just six months earlier.

The 29-year-old strangled his wife with a metal hoover pipe before forcing her body into the 22-inch deep incinerator and setting it alight.

Neighbours described a smell similar to the kind which comes from a crematorium but Ginday told them he was just 'burning some rubbish'.

He then reported his wife missing and police attended the marital home on Victory Road in Walsall, West Midlands.

Officers returned the next day when they saw black smoke billowing from the property and discovered Varkha's charred remains in the incinerator .

Ginday was arrested and initially denied killing his wife before eventually claiming he had 'lost control' and strangled her to death.

The IT expert pleaded guilty to manslaughter and a further charge of perverting the course of justice by lying to police but denied murdering his new bride.

But a jury of five men and seven women found him guilty of murder unanimously today following a three-week trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

Sentencing Ginday to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 21 years, Judge John Warner said he had showed a 'complete lack of any humanity' and had told 'lie after lie' in a bid to escape justice.

Following the verdict, Varkha's heartbroken mother paid tribute to her 'precious' daughter and told how she knew Ginday had planned the murder all along.

Kashmir Kaur, speaking from her home in Nawanshahr, India, said: 'He didn't like girls - he liked boys.

'He had already made his plans to marry a girl from India and kill her. He'd already made the plan and my innocent daughter has been killed for no reason.

'She had no idea what she was getting in to. He could have left her here in India - she could have stayed with us.

The couple had wed six months earlier after Ginday travelled to India and met 15 women before marrying Varkha in front of 700 guests

'She was the most precious of my daughters, she was my favourite. She had four degrees, she had a good life here, she was a very dutiful daughter.

'He killed her in such a heartless way and should be locked up for a long time. '

Ginday showed no emotion as the verdict was delivered and is expected to be jailed for life this afternoon.

The trial heard university graduate Ginday travelled to India in October 2012 and met 15 women before marrying Varkha in front of 700 guests on March 28 last year.

Varkha's mother Kashmir Kaur has paid tribute to her 'most precious' daughter, who she said had four degrees

Ginday said Varkha had threatened to leave him after finding evidence of his sexuality on his phone

The new bride, who had completed a 
degree and a master's degree in science and IT in her home country,
 came to the UK on August 10.

Just
 a month later on September 12, Ginday killed his wife in their bedroom 
before dragging her body downstairs and dumping it in the burning 
incinerator.

The jury heard Ginday had only married Varkha because he wanted to hide his sexuality and not bring shame on his family.

Ginday had been frequenting gay bars and having relationships with men around the time of his engagement to Varkha in 2012.

The jury in the trial were shown CCTV images of Ginday filling up a bottle with petrol just hours before Varkha's burnt body was discovered by police

Detective Chief Inspector Sarbjit Johal said Ginday 'tricked a poor innocent girl into marriage but was living a lie'

He told the court they began fighting
 when she confronted him about his sexuality after she had found 
'material' on his iPad and iPhone.

Sentencing Ginday to life imprisonment today, Judge Warner said: 'You suggest in the case going over to India to ask Varkha to marry you was not deceitful... It was clearly a fundamental deception.

'It was a very cruel situation you put her in. She was a vulnerable woman 1,000 miles from her close family. You should not have deceived in her in that way.

'Only two people know what happened that afternoon she is not here to tell us. You have told lie after lie about a number of matters making it impossible to rely on what you say.

'The state of her body was such Dr Kolar, the pathologist, couldn't even determine the cause of her death. Your injuries were caused by her desperate attempts to save herself.

At first, he denied killing her but later claimed he had 'lost control' after she threatened to 'expose him in the community'

'It may be that you formed the intentions to do what you did as long as ago as when you bought the incinerator.

'You
 are a very devious, controlling man and a meticulous planner in a 
number of aspects of your life. By the day itself you had sorted out 
what you going to do.

'Killing her was dreadful enough but what followed was horrible even beyond imagining.

'You behaved in an unbelievably casual and callous way with a complete lack of any humanity.

'No
 one who was in court to hear that evidence will easily put out of their
 minds the image of her body being poked and prodded by you down into 
that incinerator.

'Her death and manner of her death has had a profound effect on her family leaving a gap which cannot be filled.'

Police noted nothing suspicious when they first visited the couple's home in Walsall, West Midlands but returned when they saw smoke rising from the garden

Neighbours noticed a burning smell,  but Ginday told them he was just 'burning some rubbish'

During the trial, Ginday had claimed his wife had threatened to 'out him' to the community.

The Royal Bank of
Scotland employee  said he had realised he was gay at the age of 12 but felt 
unable to tell his parents the truth because they would be 'devastated'.

He told the jury: 'She started saying that she had found out about me. She said "I have found out that you're gay".

'I
 was shocked, I didn't know how to react. She said "I'm going to leave 
you, I'm going to tell everyone. I'm going to expose you to the 
community".'

'After that everything happened so quickly. We started to fight and I was trying to plead with her not to tell anyone

'I
 didn't want anyone to know about my sexuality because I knew there 
would be a lot of issues surrounding that. I still wanted to work the 
relationship out.

A 22-inch deep incinerator like that Ginday used to burn his wife's body

'It happened so fast. We ended up on the bedroom floor. There was scratching going on. Then all of a sudden I lost control.'

The court heard two police officers found the charred remains of Varkha in the incinerator on September 13.

Prosecutor
 Debi Gould said: 'A PC Dutton lifted the lid and found herself looking 
down on a human skull which was severely burnt.'

Pathologists
 later confirmed the human remains were Varkha's and that she had died 
from strangulation by a metal pole being placed across her throat.

During
 the trial the jury were shown CCTV images of Ginday filling up a water 
bottle with petrol at a service station just hours before his wife's 
remains were found.

Footage of celebrations held for the 
wedding of Ginday's sister Manjit - less than a week before Varkha's 
death - were also played to the court.

In the videos, the couple were seen having their photos taken together and then joining hands to dance alongside a crowd of people.

After the verdict, Varkha's cousin Sunil Kumar said: 'No words can truly express the sadness and hurt my family and I are experiencing at the loss of Varkha, she was loved dearly by all, she had a great passion for life and doted on her family.

'Varkha attained a masters degree and was driven to make her life a success, unfortunately she fell prey to Ginday who had ulterior motives which Varkha would not have appreciated.'

Detective Chief Inspector Sarbjit Johal, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Ginday got married as a matter of convenience - he tricked a poor innocent girl into marriage but was living a lie.

'When she uncovered the truth he could not live with it and killed her quickly then tried to dispose of her body and her possessions by burning them.

'Had another day passed before police attended, Ginday may well have successfully removed all traces of Varkha.

'I hope that this verdict brings some comfort to Varkha's family who have travelled from India to see justice is brought for their daughter.'
