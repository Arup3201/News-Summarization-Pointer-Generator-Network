A bookmaker's have accused television insiders and friends in the know of betting on the outcome of the eagerly anticipated Great British Bake Off after a flurry of bets were placed on 'outsider' Frances Quinn.

Bookies Coral were left badly burned by the bets on eventual winner Miss Quinn, who had been backed at just 5-2 when betting opened after last week's semi final.

However, the odds for the 31-year-old quickly rose to 11-10, making her favourite, after punters rushed to back her.

Pay out: Bookmaker's coral were forced to close its Great British Bake Off book after a flurry of bets were placed on 'outsider' Frances Quinn, prompting fears of television insiders placing wagers on the outcome

Fearing insiders had been betting on the pre-recorded BBC Two show, Coral were forced to suspend the book after 90 per cent of wagers favoured Miss Quinn.

The children's clothing designer had been seen as an outsider to take the top prize, as judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood regularly criticised her spectacular creations as a victory for 'style over substance'.

Her rival Kimberley Wilson, 30, had been favourite to be named champion, having been initially given odds of 11-8.

However, Miss Quinn saw off Ms Wilson and 21-year-old Ruby Tandoh, who had been backed at 6-4, thanks to her rainbow-style savoury picnic pie and show stopper three-tier wedding cake, inspired by the Shakespearean play A Midsummer Night's Dream.

Tuesday night's final was watched by more than nine million viewers.

Rising odds: Frances was initially the 5-2 outsider, but her odds quicky rose to 11-10 making her the firm favourite

'We were the only bookmaker to actually take bets on Great British Bake Off after last week’s semi-final, and we did so knowing that as the show was pre-recorded someone somewhere would know the outcome, so we always kept stakes quite low, but that didn’t stop plenty of people getting their bets on before we took the decision to suspend betting because more than 90 per cent of bets taken were for Frances,' said Coral’s David Stevens.

'Kimberley Wilson, the original 11-8 favourite, and Paul Hollywood’s favourite, Ruby Tandoh, 6-4 second favourite, hardly attracted a bet between them, and their odds drifted to 2-1 and 3-1 respectively.

'Most of the bets were placed online, many from new customers, and we face a four figure payout now Frances has been crowned champion, so it’s fair to say we have had our fingers burned by this Bake Off.

'However we have no complaints as there was always a risk attached to betting on a non-live show, and for those who backed Frances, her victory really was the icing on the cake.'

Mr Stevens said that Coral had not contacted police about the insider fears, but said that the bookmaker was unsure if bets would be taken on next year's show - which is due to move to BBC One due to its popularity.

He added: 'We have lost a few thousand but we take that on the chin, it's been good fun and we have maybe learned our lesson.

'We will see what we do about it next year.'

A BBC spokesman said the broadcaster would not be commenting on the claims.
