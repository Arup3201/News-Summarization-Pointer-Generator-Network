Last year was the safest in the history of commercial aviation despite the loss of two high-profile Malaysia Airlines flights in which hundreds of people were killed, according to industry experts.

While more people died in air accidents in 2014 than the
average in recent years, the number of fatal accidents compared
with the total number of flights was a record low, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said.

The organisations said in a new report that there were 12 fatal accidents in 2014 with 641 fatalities, versus 19 fatal accidents and 517 fatalities per year in the five-year period between 2009 and 2013.

The downing of MH17, in which 298 people died, was not included in the safety report because it was not technically classed as an accident

'While aviation safety was in the headlines in 2014, the
data show that flying continues to improve its safety
performance,' said Tony Tyler, IATA's director general and chief
executive officer.

The statistics translate into an accident rate, measured in 'hull
losses' per 1 million flights, of 0.23, or the equivalent of one
for every 4.4 million flights.

IATA's 2014 statistics did not include the loss of Malaysia
Airlines Flight MH17, which was shot down by a surface-to-air
anti-aircraft missile in Ukraine last June and so not classified
as an accident. All 298 people on board were killed.

'To the flying public an air tragedy is an air tragedy,
regardless of how it is classified,' said Tyler. 'In 2014 we saw
a reduction in the number of fatal accidents - and that would be
true even if we were to include MH17 in the total.'

The other high-profile event of 2014, the disappearance of
Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to
Beijing on March 8, 2014, with 239 passengers and crew, has
become one of the biggest mysteries in the history of aviation.

An extensive search in the southern Indian Ocean, where
satellite data showed that the Boeing 777-200ER ended up after
being diverted from its original flight path, has not found any
sign of the plane.

An investigation report that was released on
Sunday did not reveal anything new.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a
United Nations body that regulates global aviation, proposed
after MH370 that commercial aircraft report their position every
15 minutes instead of the current norm of 30-40 minutes.

Tyler told reporters at a briefing in Hong Kong that such a
system would be in place by November 2016.

'At the moment there's no technology that can track aircraft
everywhere in the world over time,' he said. 'These things don't
happen overnight.'

New space-based technologies might make real-time tracking
possible soon, he added.

'The promise is to be able to identify aircraft wherever
they are in the world pretty much in real-time with no gaps in
coverage,' he said.

'It may well be that this is the way we
should go, however that technology won't be available for two or
three years to come.'

Three of last year's 12 plane crashes involved jet aircraft and accounted for the bulk of the deaths. In December, an AirAsia jet carrying 162 people crashed into the Java Sea. In July, an Air Algerie jet went down in Mali during bad weather, killing all 116 aboard.

The nine other crashes involved turboprop aircraft, including a TransAsia ATR-72 that crashed in July on the Penghu island chain in the Taiwan Strait, killing 58 people.

Another TransAsia turboprop crashed in February this year, killing more than 40 people.

The wreckage of AirAsia QZ8501 is removed from a rescue vessel in Jakarta, Indonesia. The plane crashed into the Java Sea on December 28, killing all 162 on board

This was despite disappearance of MH370 and shooting down of MH17

But MH17 death toll not included in report because it was not an accident

An AirAsia flight also crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 162 on board
