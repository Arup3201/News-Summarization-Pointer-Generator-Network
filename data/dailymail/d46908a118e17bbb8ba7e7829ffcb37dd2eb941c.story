Two strange, cloud-like plumes reaching high above the surface of Mars are causing a stir among scientists.

On two separate occasions in March and April 2012, amateur astronomers reported definite plume-like features developing on the planet.

The plumes were seen rising to altitudes of over 155 miles (250 km) above the same region of Mars, and could help explain what makes up the Martian atmosphere.

The phenomenon was observed on March 12, 2012 over the 'terminator', which is the boundary between day and night on Mars.

One of the plumes developed in around 10 hours and lasted for 11 days, shifting shape from 'double blob protrusions' to pillars which merged into a 'finger' shape.

A second was spotted nearby on April 6, 2012, and lasted about 10 days.

'At about 155 miles (250 km), the division between the atmosphere and outer space is very thin, so the reported plumes are extremely unexpected,' says Agustin Sanchez-Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao, Spain, who led the study.

The plumes could be made of particles of water or carbon dioxide, said the paper published in the journal Nature Geoscience.

Alternatively, it could be an aurora, similar to the shimmering light show that develops in Earth's atmosphere when solar particles collide with Earth's magnetic field.

Past surveillance by scientific orbiters have suggested Terra Cimmeria to have a 'strip' with a strong but localised magnetic field.

If this is the case, the Martian 'aurora' would be a remarkable 1,000 times brighter than its terrestrial equivalent.

But 'both explanations defy our current understanding of Mars' upper atmosphere', the scientists admit.

Their trails were vast, extending between 310 miles and 620 miles (500 and 1,000 km) in north-to-south and east-to-west directions.

The 'clouds' were seen at high altitude, at about 155 miles (250km), roughly above Terra Cimmeria, which is part of Mars' rugged southern highlands, according to the paper.

Mars is being scrutinised for signs of water and volcanic activity, both of which could theoretically nurture some form of life.

Clouds of dust or ice crystals have been spotted occasionally over Mars in the past.

But they have never been as extensive as the latest two, and they always formed at an altitude below 100km.

None of the spacecraft orbiting Mars saw the features because of their viewing geometries and illumination conditions at the time.

However, checking archived Hubble images taken between 1995 and 1999 and of databases of amateur images spanning 2001 to 2014 revealed occasional clouds at the limb of Mars, albeit usually only up to 62 miles (100km) in altitude.

But one set of Hubble images from 17 May 1997 revealed an abnormally high plume, similar to that spotted by the amateur astronomers in 2012.

Scientists are now working on determining the nature and cause of the plumes by using the Hubble data in combination with the images taken by amateurs.

The plumes could be made of particles of water or carbon dioxide, said the paper published in the journal Nature Geoscience.

The plumes were spotted on two occasions, in  March and April 2012

One of the plumes developed in around 10 hours and lasted for 11 days

@highlight

Their trails extended between 310 miles and 620 miles (500 and 1,000 km)

@highlight

One theory is that they are clouds of carbon dioxide or water particles

@highlight

Another is they are the Martian version of Northern and Southern lights

Plumes could help scientists better understand the Martian atmosphere
