More than 450 cigar lovers took part in an unusual contest at Havana's annual marquee Cigar Festival yesterday... as they competed to see who could create the longest ash. 

Pungent smoke filled the room, obscuring 
the lights and leaving clothing and skin reeking. There was applause, 
shouts and laughter, and above all plenty of H. Upmann Sir Winstons - 
formidable 7-inch Cuban cigars.

The production of Cuban cigars experienced an 8 per cent growth in 2013 adding $447million to the island nation's economy. 

And in a cavernous room in Havana's Palace of Conventions, stogie aficionados ashed in on the welcome boost as they celebrated in a happy haze of smoke.

Smoke down: More than 450 cigar lovers took part in an unusual contest at Havana's annual marquee Cigar Festival yesterday... as they competed to see who could create the longest ash

Hot competition: Some of the contestants managed to make their H. Upmann Sir Winstons cigars last the whole seven inches without breaking

'I love it,' Argentine sommelier Flavio 
Lanfredi said good-naturedly despite falling out of contention early on.
 'For me this is like going to Mecca, or a kid entering a toy store and 
they tell you to grab whatever you want, it's yours. It's really 
exciting.'

Contestants exhaled clouds of smoke and handled their cigars gingerly to keep the gray ash intact as long as possible. They lolled on luxurious leather chairs set amid tables holding dozens of ashtrays, lighters, chocolate-flavored hard candy and snifters of aged Cuban rum.

Happy haze: Just over a half-hour in, only a handful of finalists remained. Judges milled about the room handing out rulers to measure the results

Hard at work: A day earlier, cigar rollers worked overtime preparing tobacco leaves for for the festival at the H. Upmann cigar factory in Havana

Toasted gold: The Sir Winston is a chubby cigar with a rich brown color and a hint of toasted gold

Tobacco country: It's hand-rolled with a selection of tobacco leaves from the western province of Pinar del Rio, the cradle of Cuba's tobacco country

Many, like Lanfredi, lost their ashes before smoking even halfway through. Others managed to keep going until their cigars were little more than tiny stubs.

'It was a little bit stressful, and I'm somewhat dizzy,' said Cuban restaurateur Andres Espinosa, one of the better finishers with a 6.2-inch (15.8-cm) ash.

Just over a half-hour in, only a handful of finalists remained. Judges milled about the room handing out rulers to measure the results.

The winner was to be announced Friday.

Boxing up: When the cigars are finished, they are boxed up in traditional Cuban cigar boxes and shipped out, ready to smoke

Good label: A single cigar costs around Â£30 in the UK, although in Cuba they go for less than a quarter of that price

Roll up: Rolling a cigar is a very delicate and skilled process

It would be hard to top Olivia Terri, also from Cuba, who smoked her Sir Winston down to a stub with an ash that grew to 6.6 inches (16.7 cm) before it crumbled.

The Sir Winston is a chubby cigar with a rich brown color and a hint of toasted gold. It's hand-rolled with a selection of tobacco leaves from the western province of Pinar del Rio, the cradle of Cuba's tobacco country.

Restricted: Although the government of Cuba permits US citizens to visit, the US government restricts its citizens from travelling there, except with a license issued by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control

Strong laws: Americans who get caught visiting Cuba without the proper permission can face 10 years in prison and $250,000 in individual fines

Smoke break: A cigar roller smokes a cigar while working at the Corona factory in Havana. It is common to see rollers smoke while they work in Havana

Guided tour: Some 1,500 smokers from 80 countries are attending the weeklong festival

The event was both a light-hearted competition and also an exhibition calculated to show off Cuba's premium tobacco, which is among the most coveted in the world. Some 1,500 smokers from 80 countries are attending the weeklong festival, including a host of Americans despite an embargo by their homeland on spending money in the country - an effective travel ban.

Although the government of Cuba permits US citizens to visit, the US government restricts its citizens from travelling there, except with a license issued by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.

But without the proper permission, getting caught can result in 10 years in prison and $250,000 in individual fines.

However, relations between the two countries have thawed in recent years with some travel restrictions lifted. As a result, legal U.S. travel to the island reached nearly 600,000 visitors in 2013, according to a recent poll.

'This (contest) in particular is aimed at people being able to appreciate the quality of our product,' said Ana Lopez, marketing director for Habanos SA, a Cuban-British joint company that produces and distributes Cuban cigars exclusively. 'Only products of magnificent quality can make the ash take on a permanent consistency for a long time.'
