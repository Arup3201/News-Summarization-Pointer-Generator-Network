A university student has told how he became a 'human fireball' after a doorman deliberately set fire to his fancy dress sheep costume.

Sean Collins, 22, whose home-made costume was covered with cotton wool balls, was at a Preston nightclub for a friend's 21st birthday when his costume caught fire in what he assumed was an accident.

Engulfed in flames, it took him ten seconds to rip the burning costume off, during which Mr Collins suffered horrific burns to his hands and arms.

Mr Collins, from Sunderland, may need two more years of treatment and suffers from anxiety and depression

He was rushed to hospital where medics said he had sustained 12 per cent burns to his body and needed several skin grafts and extensive hospital treatment.

The forensic science and criminal investigation student at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston said: 'I became a human fireball instantly.  I could feel this intense pain which I can't even begin to describe.'

He later discovered that his injuries had been caused by a doorman at the Evoque nightclub, whom he'd never met, holding his cigarette lighter to the costume.

Yesterday the bouncer, father of two Thomas McGuiness, 24, from Chorley, Lancashire, was jailed for 18 months at Preston Crown Court after admitting unlawful wounding.

Before jailing McGuiness, Judge Michael Leeming, QC, murmured 'horrific' and there were gasps in the courtroom as CCTV footage of the moment Sean's costume was set alight was played.

Hanifa Patel, prosecuting, said Mr Collins, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, who had made his outfit out of cotton wool balls and hairspray to keep them in place, was having a cigarette with friends when 'All of a sudden his costume ended up alight.'

She added: 'When officers arrived at the scene the victim was being treated for his injuries and the defendant was present.

'He was standing very close and trying to see what was happening.  He then commented: "It was my fault. I was talking to my girlfriend having a cigarette and as I was waving my hand my cigarette caught him and he set alight.

"'I'm an off-duty doorman and work at Evoque if you need to speak to me."'

Miss Patel said that Mr Collins' injuries after the incident on January 17 meant he had missed two months of the final year of his course at UCLan and had had to give up his part-time job in the kitchen at McDonald's.

Adrian Williams, defending, said: 'This was an incredibly stupid prank, not a deliberate assault on Mr Collins.

'This defendant was shocked by the consequences of his actions, he did not foresee them at all but he is responsible for them.'

Mr Collins said: 'I remember standing having a cigarette with two of my mates - the next minute I was on fire.

Engulfed in flames: The student became a 'human fireball' in seconds and said the pain was 'intense'

'I literally just burst into flames and I remember feeling shock and panic.  I could feel this intense pain which I can't even begin to describe.

'It had taken me about 12 hours to make the costume and I became a human fireball instantly.  I panicked and ran around trying to get the suit off.

'The whole thing was on fire and I knew I just had to get it off.  My friends tried to help me and it took about ten seconds in total.

'Afterwards I ran into the street and sank to the pavement in shock.'

Mr Collins was transferred from the Royal Preston Hospital for further care at South Manchester University Hospital where he underwent several skin graft operations.

He may need a further two years of treatment, and has been left suffering anxiety and depression.

He said: 'I was dealing with it pretty well for the first few days when I was in hospital because I thought it was an accident - I really thought someone had caught me with a cigarette.  But then when the police came to see me and told me it wasn't an accident, it really affected me.

'I was devastated that someone could do something like that, especially to someone they'd never met.

'It was completely unprovoked.'

He added: 'I suppose in some ways I'm lucky it wasn't worse but my head is all over the place now.'

Mr Collins said he was 'majorly disappointed' with the sentence, and added: 'I feel like what he's done hasn't been taken seriously.  If I hadn't managed to get the suit off I could have died, but he'll be out before too long.'
