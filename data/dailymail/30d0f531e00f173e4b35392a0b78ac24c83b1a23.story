Landfill workers called police after seeing Oregon's disgraced former first couple dumping trash after learning they would be the subject of a federal investigation. 

John Kitzhaber, who resigned as the state's governor last week, and his fiancée, Cylvia Hayes, were seen at the Knott Landfill Site in the city of Bend.

With federal investigators looking into the scandal that forced Kitzhaber to quit, employees alerted authorities after the pair paid a visit.

Kitzhaber bowed to pressure following months of news reports alleging Hayes used her relationship with him to land clients for her consulting business.

The probe is looking into possible corruption and financial crimes including wire or mail fraud, bribery and tax evasion

Stepped down: Kitzhaber bowed to pressure following months of news reports alleging Hayes used her relationship with him to land clients for her consulting business 

Deschutes County sheriff's deputies poked through the couple's trash for about an hour, Timm Schimke, director of the county's solid waste department, told the Bend Bulletin. 

The Knott Landfill is located just outside Bend, where Hayes owns a home.

'They looked like any other people who were cleaning out their garage or cleaning out a rental. It was just stuff,' Schimke said. 

'They weren't manipulating the stuff. They were just tossing it out, and they were only in there for two or three minutes and then they left.'

Their trash included old campaign signs for Hayes, who ran for the Legislature more than a decade ago, and a mattress or box spring, Schimke said.

Kitzhaber resigned last week under pressure over Hayes' work for advocacy groups with an interest in state policy. 

Federal authorities are investigating. Kitzhaber has denied the couple did anything wrong.

'It just seemed strange that they were at a transfer station dumping waste so soon after him resigning and them being under investigation,' Schimke said.

Darryl Nakahira, legal counsel at the Sheriff's Office, is forwarding all questions and requests for information to the FBI, which doesn't respond to inquiries involving ongoing criminal investigations. 

Alert: Employees at The Knott Landfill Site in Bend, Oregon, called the police after noticing the couple

Hayes — at the center of an ethics scandal that forced the resignation of Gov. John Kitzhaber — has launched a legal fight to keep her private emails out of the public eye.

The lawsuit came to light Thursday, the same day that Oracle Inc., the tech giant that built Oregon's botched health insurance exchange, filed a lawsuit against several of Kitzhaber's former campaign advisers. The company accuses Kitzhaber's advisers of orchestrating the abandonment of the Cover Oregon website to help his re-election effort. Oracle also served notice that it may sue Kitzhaber and his former chief of staff.

The flurry of lawsuits keeps alive two controversies that weighed on Oregon's once-popular governor.

Hayes, who is engaged to marry the former Democratic governor, filed a lawsuit Wednesday against The Oregonian asking a judge to rule that she is not required to turn over her emails to the newspaper.

She's resisting an order from the state Department of Justice that says emails from her private email accounts that concern state business must be provided to The Oregonian, which requested them under the state's public records law.
