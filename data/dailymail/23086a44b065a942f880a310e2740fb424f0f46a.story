A CD of the sounds of silence from inside a village church has sold out after becoming an unlikely hit.

The 30-minute recording was originally created to help raise some extra funds for repairs to St Peter's Church in Seaford, East Sussex.

Church members believed the atmosphere in their small 12th century church was so unique that its peacefulness would appeal to a wider audience.

Unlikely sell-out:  The Sound of Silence 30-minute CD recording from inside St Peter's Church has attracted buyers from as far afield as Ghana

So they left some recording equipment on inside the building for half-an-hour.

The only sounds that can be heard on the CD are the odd squeaking of the wooden pews, some footsteps and the distant hum of passing traffic.

After selling out of the CD during a recent open day the church has now taken orders for it from as far afield as Germany, Austria and Ghana.

Roger Bing, 74, from Seaford, the church member who came up with the idea, said: 'The church was planning an open day and wanted something a little bit different to catch the attention of people who were coming along.

'The church has got quite good recording equipment so we decided to make a CD of 30 minutes of silence.

'It is pretty much silence throughout with a few background noises.

'There are a few little noises here and there - I think if it was total silence people might get a bit bored.

'So if you listen carefully you will hear some pews squeaking, footsteps and the distant hum of traffic going past outside.

'The people who have bought it say they have really enjoyed it.

'In this day and age everybody seems to live busier, noisier lives.

'People sometimes like to sit down and just have a bit of peace and quiet for a little while.

'This CD is great for that and people have mentioned it is very relaxing to listen to.

'It has also been used by people for meditation, which I think is splendid.'

Dr Andrew Mayes, the Revd Canon of St Peter's Church, said: 'It is an 800-year-old sacred space with a wonderful quality of silence.

'We thought the idea of the peaceful silence you get inside the church could be something a little it different and I'm delighted it has proved so popular.

'At first there were one or two skeptical responses but in the end I think everybody agreed it was a very good idea.'
