Ready for lessons in her school uniform, and hugging her parents on a family holiday, Katie’s childhood photos are like any other young girl’s.

The pictures give no sign of the horrors that awaited her when she met her abuser.

At 14, she fell for the man ten years her senior who groomed her into a violent relationship and separated her from her family.

Yet council workers and police acted as if she was to blame for getting involved with the convicted criminal, she claimed.

She said one officer, attending an incident where her abuser had threatened to kill her, even told her: ‘Well, what did you expect?’

Katie – not her real name – was attacked several times by the man, who had served two jail terms, but said police did nothing to help her and saw the assaults as just ‘a bit of domestic violence’. 

Her desperate parents had her put into care, hoping it would end the relationship, but she said carers openly allowed him to continue visiting.

Yesterday she called on South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright, responsible for Rotherham children’s services, from 2005 to 2010, to resign.

Katie, now 29, said: ‘He should be ashamed of himself. The more he holds on to his job, the harder it will be for victims to move forward.’

She said it was ‘disgraceful’ her abuser was still walking free and that council and police staff had held on to their jobs, adding: ‘I was emotional when I first saw [the report] on the news, but now I am in anger mode – I want justice to be done.

‘When I was 14 and 15 I thought I was in love with him, but when I was 16 I made a statement because there’s only so much you can take. 

'The police took a statement and to my knowledge he has never even been questioned. He should have been punished.’

Katie’s abuser was allegedly reported to police by a council organisation for victims of child sex offences in 2001, after it heard from 18 girls who described him as their ‘boyfriend’.

Yesterday, South Yorkshire Police did not respond to requests to confirm whether they had taken any action against the man.
