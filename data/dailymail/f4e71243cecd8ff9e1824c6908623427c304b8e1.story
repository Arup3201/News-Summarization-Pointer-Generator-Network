It may be a little cruel to suggest the green look on Friday to the Ageas Bowl pitch for the third Test will suit India more than England’s bowlers but there is no question it is not just Alastair Cook under severe pressure on Sunday.

The failure of England’s attack to take advantage of conditions made for them at Lord’s means there are question marks over the senior bowlers going into a match where the consequences of another defeat would not bear thinking about.

The success of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and then, with short-pitched bowling that had failed England, Ishant Sharma was a salutary lesson to an England attack who should have had the Test won on the first morning after Cook won the toss.

Agonising: Cook tilts his head back in frustration as he plays rugby during England training

Clearly, Cook had his senior players in mind when he said in the aftermath of the second Test embarrassment that England had not lost because of his captaincy and he will consider two changes on Sunday to a misfiring attack.

Peter Moores famously brought Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad into the England side at the expense of Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard in New Zealand during his first reign as coach and now he must decide whether the time is right to call time, at least temporarily, on one of the big two.

Neither Anderson nor Broad are coming to the end of the line but, with three back-to-back Tests still to come, the time is surely right to freshen up the attack and allow Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes a chance to prove their worth.

The last thing England need is to go back to the days in the 80s and 90s when their constant chopping and changing undermined a fragile side but there is a strong case for Jordan, in superb form for Sussex, to replace Ben Stokes.

Jordan was unlucky to be dropped in the first place after making an outstanding impression in one-day cricket but there was a feeling he was still stuck in limited-overs mode in a Headingley Test against Sri Lanka where he failed to take a single wicket.

Now Jordan is said to have got his wrist position right again for first-class cricket and was swinging the ball at pace at Horsham against Warwickshire this week. Stokes has a huge role to play in England’s future but his woeful run with the bat means he will surely miss out now.

It is whether Woakes replaces either Anderson, Broad or even Liam Plunkett that provides England with an intriguing question on a pitch that Hampshire believe will have pace, bounce and carry.

Clearly it is harsh to blame Anderson for what has gone wrong this season because he was man of the series against Sri Lanka, man of the match against India at Trent Bridge and has thrown his heart and soul into the ‘new’ England.

Yet his failure to live up to his billing as the best swing bowler in the world when it most mattered at Lord’s was an indication, as much as anything, of his severe workload that is exacerbated by the retirement of Graeme Swann.

Anderson looked out on his feet at Lord’s and has the threat of suspension for the last two Tests of the series hanging over him so England must decide whether to utilise him now or take him out of the firing line.

Broad simply did not look fit at Lord’s, where he had perhaps his worst Test for England for many a year, and clearly the knee injury that has restricted his potency will need an operation sooner rather than later.

Yet he is a fighter and both wants and expects to play in the first ever Test in England to start on a Sunday, a move which has seriously hampered Hampshire’s chances of cashing in on only their second Test at this purpose-built ground.

Ticket sales have been sluggish with the ground expected to be no more than half full from Monday onwards but one man who just might provide the spark that could put more bottoms on Ageas Bowl seats is debutant Jos Buttler.

All the young players brought into the England side this year have made an impression but none are as potentially exciting as the gifted Buttler, who must now try to bring his innovative, explosive game to Test cricket.

‘Test cricket has been my ultimate goal and this has probably come a bit sooner than I expected,’ said Buttler on Friday. ‘But it means I’m going in the right direction and I’m excited about Sunday.’

Buttler had insisted after his sublime one-day century against Sri Lanka at Lord’s earlier this season that he was not ready for Test cricket but the physical demise of Matt Prior has elevated him to the all important batsman-keeper slot.

Throwing it away: England do not want to go 2-0 down in the series with a defeat at the Ageas Bowl

‘Mentally I’ve come round to the fact I was closer than I thought at the time because my cricket has progressed quickly,’ said the softly-spoken Buttler. ‘Test cricket is going to be completely different but this year I’ve been scoring more runs in the championship and everything’s been going well.’

Now Buttler, who admits he will have to adapt his game to the ultimate format, has the added responsibility of having to excite as well as score runs and provide glovework that he admits is ‘still a work in progress.’

‘If you look around the world there are people who play in an aggressive manner and do well,’ said the man who joined Lancashire this season to keep regularly. ‘When Kevin Pietersen played for England people were excited to watch him and David Warner has filled that role with Australia. It would be silly of me to go into my shell completely and curb my natural instincts.’

There is much for Buttler and whatever bowlers form the England attack to play for on Sunday.
