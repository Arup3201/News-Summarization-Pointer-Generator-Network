Children as young as three have been forced to watch the public flogging of six men accused of adultery by the Islamic State.

Pictures have emerged showing crowds gathering in the Syrian stronghold of Raqqa as the terror group metes out the punishment under its warped interpretation of Shariah law.

The men are made to stand in a circle before being lashed with poles by ISIS fighters as another militant beckons to the crowd while waving the group's sinister black flag.  

Lashed: Six young men are flogged by ISIS in the Syrian stronghold of Raqqa as children as young as three gather to watch the punishment being handed down under its warped interpretation of Shariah law

Pictures show young children aged from around three to their early teens being forced to watch the flogging 

The men were sentenced to 100 lashes for adultery and banished from the self-styled caliphate, which covers a third of Iraq and Syria, for a year, it was reported by www.raqqa-sl.com. 

Among the crowd are several young children aged from around three to their early teens.

They were apparently forced to watch by their parents who appear to be enjoying the spectacle.

The site did not elaborate on the details of their alleged crimes.

In December, ISIS released a document on social media explaining the rules of its 'penal code', which is being brutally enforced across ISIS-held territory.

Entitled 'Clarification [regarding] the Hudud', the document contains a list of the punishments handed out for crimes committed in the Islamic State, in accordance with the extremist group's radical interpretation of Shariah law.

All punishments are carried out after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court and, after the sentencing, the prisoner is taken into the centre of the town or city.

Under ISIS, all punishments are carried out after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court and, after the sentencing, the prisoner is taken into the centre of the town or city for the sentence to be carried out in public

Men and young boys of all ages are actively encouraged to gather and watch the punishments.

An ISIS fighter then reads out the charges found against the victim before the punishment is carried out in public.

All forms of blasphemy against Islam are punished by execution, even if the accuser chooses to repent of their sins. 

Likewise, committing murder, spying, apostasy or sodomy is punished by immediate death.

Anyone found guilty of banditry, specifically murder and stealing, is put to death by crucifixion.

According to Islamic State's reading of Shariah law, thieves have a hand cut off. It is unclear whether the victim can choose which hand is removed.

Flogging is another common punishment carried out under Islamic State.  

According to the document, 80 lashes of the whip is given to anyone who drinks alcohol or is found guilty of committing slander. 

Normally the whipping is not carried out on bare skin. 

Footage shows the man sat on a plastic chair, while blindfolded, before being thrown off the tower block

It is believed the man was hurled from the building, at least seven storeys high, as punishment for 'being gay'

The punishment of stoning, where heavy rocks are thrown or piled on top of the victim, is ordered for any married man or woman who has committed adultery.

A hundred lashes and immediate exile is given to any man or woman who has sex outside of marriage.

The flogging pictures emerged as it was revealed ISIS had reportedly blindfolded and man and threw him off a tower block in Syria for ‘being gay’ before being stoned to death after surviving the fall.

New images have emerged appearing to show ISIS militants hurling the man off the seven-storey building in the town of Tal Abyad in Raqqa.

The man, who was supposedly being punished for having a ‘homosexual affair’, apparently survived the fall, but was stoned to death by a waiting crowd at the foot of the tower block. 

The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, claims the man was thrown from the building before being beaten to death.

Photographs of the incident appear to show the man - who is thought to be in his 50s - sat on a white, plastic chair while blindfolded.

He is surrounded by at least two masked militants, who are dressed in black clothing and army fatigues.

The man is then thrown from the top of the tower block and one photograph shows him falling towards the ground, head first.

It is believed a 'judgement' was read aloud before he was thrown, which condemned his sexuality and claimed he should be thrown from the highest point of the city as punishment.
