Lancashire all-rounder Kyle Hogg has been forced to retire from all forms of cricket due to a severe back injury, his county have announced.

The 31-year-old has taken 280 first-class wickets from 114 matches and scored 2,708 runs since making his Lancashire debut in 2001. 

His last appearance came in the Royal London One-Day Cup win over Derbyshire last month.

Hogg helped Lancashire win the LV= County Championship title in 2011 and was named as both the county's player of the Year and Championship player of the year in 2013 after taking 60 wickets at an average of 18.41.

Hogg, who signed professional terms with Lancashire on the same day as England paceman James Anderson, said: 'The news about the severity of my back condition came as a shock and I am faced with no alternative but to hang up my boots.

'I will always be a fan of Lancashire - it's in my blood - and I wish them every success for the future.'

His former team-mate Steven Croft tweeted: 'Very sad to see @kylehogg22 leave the game through injury . All the very best of luck on the next chapter mate . #bowledHogggggy'.
