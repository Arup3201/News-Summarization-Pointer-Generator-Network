A Christian militia fighting against the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group in northern Iraq has been joined by a man from Australia.

The ABC reports that Melbourne man Khamis Gewargis Khamis joined an Assyrian militia called Dwekh Nawsha, which translates as 'self sacrificers'.

After the Islamic State's assault on the Assyrian minority in Iraq the militia was formed in response. Across the north of the country IS has forced tens of thousands of Assyrians from their homes.

'They don't discriminate when it comes to killing, torture and so on," Mr Khamis told the ABC from his base in northern Iraq.

'These are barbaric people, they came here only to die for what they believe in, so you can imagine the terror that they are spreading among the families, the kids and so on.'

He is stationed with other Dwekh Nawsha fighters in a town called Baqofa, around 30 kilometres from the major IS-held city of Mosul. Mr Khamis is married and has two children.

Just two kilometres down the road is a town called Batnay, which is on the front line. IS holds the town after driving out the Christian inhabitants.

'In the last few days (Islamic State) have been trying to come to these towns. They were somehow stopped by the coalition forces, from the air, and Peshmerga as well,' Mr Khamis said.

'We are on frontline, so last few nights there has been bombing from both sides, shelling. So yes, Dwekh Nawsha is frontline, trying to defend this town as much as we can. 

'We have to have our own force, so we do need support as much as we can. We are appealing to the international community, particularly Australia, to help as well.

'To be honest, Dwekh Nawsha is not receiving anything from the central government or the Kurdistan government or Kurdistan region, as we are independent militia, so as you can imagine, these Dwekh Nawsha need salaries, weapons, accommodation and so on.'

However, Mr Khamis was ready to defend himself if there were any consequences concerning breaking Australian foreign fighters laws by taking up arms with the militia.

'I am concerned, we do love Australia, it's our second home, we love it as much as we love Iraq,' he explained.

'We are concerned, but if anything happens because of my travel here and supporting and joining Dwekh Nawsha I am happy and prepared to stand in front of the law.

'We would like the entire international community to be stronger, to get together and urgently help (the Assyrians) from the humanitarian side, and also to do what they can to eradicate (Islamic State), to eliminate them, to drive them out of these towns, villages and these territories so the people can return back to their homes and their lands.'
