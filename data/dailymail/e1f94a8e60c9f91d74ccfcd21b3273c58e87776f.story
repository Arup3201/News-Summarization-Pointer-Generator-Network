Roberto Soldado has admitted he is embarrassed at how poor his performances have been since joining Tottenham for £26million in 2013.

The striker said he was ‘ashamed’ to hear Spurs’ fans sing his name despite failing to deliver on his lofty reputation. 

The Spaniard has scored only seven goals in 38 league appearances, just one of which was in the Premier League this season.

Mauricio Pochettino has repeatedly put his faith in Soldado to justify his price tag. The Argentine also implored Spurs fans to forgive Emmanuel Adebayor, who could feature as Spurs host an in-form Burnley side on Saturday. 

It would be the first time Adebayor has played for his club since November 9 when they were beaten 2-1 by Stoke at White Hart Lane. 

He later directed his ire at home fans, claiming their booing was damaging players’ confidence.

Both big money forwards have been outshone by Spurs academy product Harry Kane, who scored his 13th goal of the season in Wednesday’s 4-0 League Cup win over Newcastle.

Soldado, who was a club record transfer from Valencia when he arrived in the summer of 2013, scored when he came off the bench to replace Kane against Newcastle. But he has struggled to find consistent scoring form.

‘From the first minute I’m involved, even before I’ve done anything, the fans show they believe in me, and I feel ashamed at not being able to satisfy them,’ he said, ‘It’s hard when they sing.

‘I hear them chanting my name and if I miss a chance, I feel bad. I can’t thank them enough. I just hope I can reach the level they expect and take advantage of the great players around me.

‘If only I knew that little something that’s missing for me to find my form, really show my game and for the goals to start flowing. I am reassured, though, because the manager (Pochettino) is giving me more minutes on the pitch.

‘With that, my time will come, because in the games I’m feeling good. The critical thing is that the goals aren’t coming but I know they will.’

Pochettino said confidence was high among his players after two consecutive victories, including an away Premier League win over Swansea. 

They have lost four times in front of home fans this season so will be keen to avoid slipping up against Sean Dyche’s Burnley, who are hovering just above the relegation zone despite taking 11 points from their last six games.

Adebayor could play a part having returned to training after being granted a week leave for ‘personal reasons’ to travel back to Ghana.

Pochettino said he thought fans would forgive the striker for saying Spurs were ‘better off’ playing away from home.

‘I think the fans love the good player. Ade is a fantastic player. I think this (his comments) are not a big problem,’ said Pochettino, ‘In football the mood changes quickly. 

'When you have lost you are upset, our fans are upset, the players are upset and I was upset. After I think we have only one objective and that is to take Tottenham as high as possible. I think this is in the past.’
