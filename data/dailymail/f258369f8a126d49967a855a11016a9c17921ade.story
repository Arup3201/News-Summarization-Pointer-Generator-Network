It's supposed to be the happiest day of your life, so what better way to celebrate your wedding than by posing as centaurs to demonstrate your love? Or riding a giant swan? Or perhaps fleeing a fire-throwing Transformer?

From the crude, to the rude, to the downright bizarre, these Russian newlyweds certainly know how to put the fun in wedding function.

Many rely heavily on post-production, whether it's shrinking a bride or blowing up a church, while others are just forensically choreographed happiness.

And when the special day is over, they will take their places in family albums so future generations can know who their ancestors really were.

Their special neigh: This happy couple couldn't stop horsing around throughout their wedding ceremony

A rearly happy occasion: This bride needed a well-earned nap after the ordeal of getting married (apparently)

Baguette me to the church on time: This bride knows exactly which side her bread is buttered

Young love: This couple couldn't get to the honeymoon suite soon enough

Thigh do! The photographer couldn't wait to start the shoot whether the brides stockings were on or not

Holy pond of marriage: This wedding was ruined by a giant swan who swooped in and whisked the happy couple off for an early honeymoon... at their local park

Always the bridesmaid: This bridesmaid was keen to show her frustration at never being the centre of attention herself

Some seem to be the newly betrothed wife seeking to show who is the boss after the nuptials.

Cars feature strongly - in one picture the couple's faces are superimposed on the wheels as they begin the journey on the family road to happiness.

To have and too cold: This bride has her husband wrapped around her little finger

Stupid's arrow: This bride was more concerned about snaring herself a groomsman than she was about her dress

Wee do: This photo raises more questions than it answers

The first chance: It wasn't long before this couple sneaked away for a bit of alone time

Who says a can of lager and a cigarette or putting a chair between your legs isn't classy?

Wedding cows: The groom at this wedding wanted nothing more than to celebrate by climbing a giant bull

Not now, dear: She was so cute he literally put her in his pocket and took her home

Give us a big kiss: There has been a huge rise in demand in recent years in Russia for mini brides

Does this dress make my bum look big? Even when all the groomsmen worked together, they couldn't get this bride to fit in her dress

Transformers in surprise: No one knew which way to turn when Optimus Prime arrived to give the bride away

A tyring day!: The congregation realised the car would need a push when the bride and groom turned into wheels

Criminal photography: The bridesmaid was inconsolable after she stumbled across the crime scene

Run for your wives: When the best man described the groom as larger than life, he didn't mean it literally

You are my strength: Her pre-wedding diet appeared to have paid off

Your love is like a giant mug: It's unclear exactly what point this picture is trying to make

Smile, we're framous: Despite every attempt to bring a touch of class to their wedding, he just couldn't take it seriously

Lenin me your ears: This couple were desperate to trumpet their union from under the statue of their favourite revolutionary

In most cases, though, you wouldn't know this is supposed to the happiest day of their lives, though one couple are look full of joy as they serenade a statue of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin.

The popular blogger who goes under the name 'pryf' simply says 'How not to take wedding pictures', and his montage is spreading like wildfire round the web.
