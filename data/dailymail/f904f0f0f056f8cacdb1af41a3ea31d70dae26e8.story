A boy with disabilities in Michigan who said he didn't want an 11th birthday party because he had no friends got the surprise of his life on Tuesday when players from his local ice hockey team showed up to offer him a special deal.                                                                                   

Colin and his family were enjoying pizza when several players and coaches from the Kalamazoo Wings appeared and presented him with a special one-day contract that will allow him to join the team for their home game at Wings Stadium on Sunday.

The contract, which is the first one-day
 deal the team has ever offered, will give Colin the opportunity to get 
his own jersey, drop the game puck and even sit on the bench with the 
players, among other activities.

‘I was not expecting this,’ Colin told the Kalamazoo Gazette. ‘I knew we were going to the restaurant, but I was not expecting the rest.’

It all came about about Colin's mother, Jennifer, who asked that her last name not be used, started a Facebook page for her son after she asked him what he wanted to do for his 11th birthday, which was on March 9. 

Colin, a 5th grader at Gull Lake Community Schools, said he didn't want a party because he didn't have any friends. 

He suffers from a sensory processing 
disorder and another disorder similar to Asperger syndrome which cause 
him to struggle with facial expressions, verbal cues and in some social 
situations.

Colin's disabilities mean that social skills aren't easy for him and he often acts out in school. He typically eats lunch alone everyday because no one will sit with him.

His mom decided to start the Facebook page as a way to boost Colin's confidence.

'I thought, if I could create a page 
where people could send him positive thoughts and encouraging words, 
that would be better than any birthday party,' she wrote.

It quickly proved to be a tremendous success and has attracted more than 2 million likes.

'It's been just overwhelming,' said Jennifer, who said her son has also received 78,000 pieces of
 mail as a consequence of her campaign.

However she said the best reward for her efforts has been seeing the growth in Colin's confidence.

'I have seen him in this last month blossom because he knows he has 2.1 million friends and that is something that nobody else has,' she said.

'His self-confidence has grown. It doesn't bother him that kids don't like him because he has 2.1 million friends.'
