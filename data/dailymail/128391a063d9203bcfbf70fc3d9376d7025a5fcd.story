As property prices continue to steadily grow, renters looking to save know full well to avoid central city locations or anywhere with a harbour view.

But new figures have revealed that it's the inner Sydney suburbs and those in the Pilbara region of Western Australia that renters should steer completely clear of.

A list of ten suburbs compiled by property information and analytics provider RP data, has revealed that New South Wales and Western Australia dominate the list of the nation's top ten most expensive suburbs.

The top ten most expensive suburbs to rent a home in are all in New South Wales and Western Australia according to a new RP Data report, with Port Hedland, WA topping the list

Topping the list of suburbs with the highest return for landlords, with a gross rental yield of 9.3 percent for the year to April, was Port Headland in WA.

With a rich mining centre located nearby, the seaside suburb 1,322 kilometres north-east of Perth has a median weekly advertised rental rate of $1,775.

The second priciest place to live in the country, unsurprisingly fell to the Sydney suburb of Mosman, with renters paying a median $1500 of rent a week.

The next two spots went to Western Australia again, for Newman ($1500) and South Hedland ($1350), both also mining towns.

The Sydney suburb of Mosman was the second most expensive suburb to rent in, with a a median weekly rental rate of $1500

Woollahra, in Sydney's eastern suburbs came 5th on the list with a weekly rental rate ofÂ  $1300, sitting in a quiet spot only five kilometres from the CBD.

Baynton and Nickol, both in WA, came close behind at $1200 and $1100 respectively.

The last three spots in the top ten went to the NSW suburbs of Seaforth, Roseville and St Ives, with rental prices between $1000 and $1100.

Newman in WA, also had a a median weekly rental rate of $1500. The subrub was follwed by South Hedland in WA, Woollahra in NSW and Baynton in WA

Rental growth has been quite moderate across the country over the last year, according to RP's reports, with house rent increasing by an average 2.6 per cent over the year to June 2014.

However when broken down across the capital cities, Sydney's rose by a huge 4 per cent while Perth actually recorded a reduction of -5 per cent in house rents over the last year.

Unit rents have meanwhile seen little change over the last quarter, with rises only recorded in the Sydney and Melbourne markets.
