Ulli Mair allegedly spent £54 on sex toys, for which she then attempted to claim reimbursement, on expenses

An Italian politician allegedly spent £54 on sex toys, for which she then attempted to claim reimbursement, on expenses.

Regional councillor Ulli Mair, a member of the German-speaking right-wing separatist party, Die Freiheitlichen, submitted the receipt for a £20 vibrator and two other sex toys from a well-known adult chain, it is alleged.

Miss Mair, who is a member of the Bolzano provincial council, in South Tyrol, an autonomous province on the border with Germany, claimed that she had bought the toys as a gift.

She said: ‘We bought the present as a joke for a colleague’s birthday. He is a bit of a joker. So we decided to give him a birthday gift. It was a bit risqué, that’s all.’

Italy’s financial police began the investigation at the beginning of the year and were combing though documents when they came across the €64.92 receipt, Italian news agency ANSA reported.

The investigation into politicians’ expenses is just one of several probes being carried out at Italy’s regional assemblies.

In January this year, 83 politicians and aides in Sicily were put under formal investigation for spending on everything from designer underwear and Louis Vuitton bags to coffee capsules and comics.

Claims included a bill for espresso machine capsules which ran up to €5,000.

Politicians also spent €179 of public money on a comic called Diabolik, according to reports.

In October, the regional council of Emilia-Romagna in central Italy was put under investigation after local politicians allegedly spent public funds on everything from €500 pens to cheese and salami.

One claimed 50 cents for a trip to a public toilet.

In 2012, a member of Berlusconi’s party, Carlo De Romanis, allegedly blew £24,000 (€30,000) of taxpayers' money on a risque toga party.

Pictures of the party, attended by around 2,000 people, have emerged showing guests dressed in tunics, wearing centurion helmets and pigs masks while drinking champagne and feeding each other grapes.
