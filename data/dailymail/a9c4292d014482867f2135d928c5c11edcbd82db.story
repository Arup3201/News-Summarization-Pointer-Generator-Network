Six months today voters will get the chance to hand David Cameron another five years in Downing Street – or kick him out in favour of Ed Miliband.

With the parties neck and neck in the polls, the election is expected to be the closest since October 1974, when Harold Wilson won a tiny three seat majority over Edward Heath – giving Labour another five years in Government.

Like Wilson 40 years ago, Mr Cameron is stuck just shy of being able to govern alone – 46 seats ahead of Labour, but 23 short of an outright Commons majority.

To get over the line, the Prime Minister needs to hold on to his 303 MPs  while winning another 23 seats just to achieve a one-seat Commons majority.

Mr Miliband meanwhile needs to take just 24 seats directly off the Tories to make Labour the biggest party in the Commons. If he is able to pull it off, the Labour leader would get the first shot at forming a Coalition government - probably with Nick Clegg as his Deputy Prime Minister.

If he manages to take 24 seats off the Conservatives while holding on to his own 257 MPs, in six months Mr Miliband will be Prime Minister with 281 seats to the Tories 279.

But, with the vast majority of seats rock-solid Labour or Tory the next election will be fought in crunch marginal constituencies. Here MailOnline reveals the Tories' 25 top targets to win in six months - and Labour's 30-seat wishlist to kick Mr Cameron onto the backbenches.

The 55 constituencies which hold the key to Number 10: If the Tories can win their 25 target seats, listed on the left,  David Cameron will have won the next election with a one seat majority. Labour meanwhile need to win the 30 seats listed on the right to become the Commons largest party

For Labour to form a majority government on their own, they need to hold on to every seat they won under Gordon Brown in 2010, while winning in another 69 constituencies around the country.

According to the latest poll for YouGov, Labour have a 1 per cent lead over the Tories – with 33 per cent of the public backing Mr Miliband’s party, to the Tories’ 32 per cent.

However, a separate Survation poll for the Daily Mirror suggests Mr Miliband has pulled ahead of the Tories – with Ukip swaying Conservative voters more than those of any other party.

According to Survation, the Tories have dropped to 27 per cent compared, with Labour standing firm on 31 per cent. Ukip is now on 24 per cent and Liberal Democrats on 9 per cent.

But, despite being ahead in the polls across the UK, Labour is facing disaster in Scotland.

Recent surveys have suggested the Scottish National Party could win 47 seats north of the border in in May – wiping out any chance of Mr Miliband winning a majority.

According to the Panelbase survey, Scottish Labour could face winning just ten seats – down from 40 today.

The poll of 1,000 adults found 45 per cent intended to vote for the SNP, 28 per cent for Labour and 15 per cent for the Tories.

Voters in just a few dozen seats will decide whether David Cameron remains in Number 10, or if Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister

The crisis in Scotland has helped spark the biggest crisis of Mr Miliband’s leadership. It comes amid rising panic that his own personal unpopularity is costing Labour support in its traditional heartlands.

Analysis of voter satisfaction ratings over four decades reveals Mr Miliband is down to minus 34. It means he is less popular than any Prime Minister or opposition leader at this point ahead of an election, except Michael Foot who led Labour to its worst ever defeat.

Jim Callaghan, Neil Kinnock, John Major, William Hague, Michael Howard and Gordon Brown all had higher net satisfaction ratings with IpsosMORI six months before being hammered at the ballot box.

Since becoming leader four years ago Mr Miliband has seen a collapse in his public satisfaction ratings. A month after he defeated his brother for the leadership, 41 per cent per of voters were satisfied with Mr Miliband with just 19 per cent dissastified, giving a net rating of 19 points.

In the latest IpsoMORI survey, published two weeks ago, the figure had slumped to -34, twice as bad as David Cameron's -17.

A separate YouGov poll found 34 per cent of people think Mr Cameron would make the best Prime Minister from a list of the four main party leaders – twice the number who backed Mr Miliband.

Some 49 per cent of Labour voters think the party would be more likely to win next year’s election if Ed was replaced as party leader.
