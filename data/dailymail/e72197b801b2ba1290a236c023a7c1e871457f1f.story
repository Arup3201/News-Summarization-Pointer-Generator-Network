Anger: Vladimir Putin's spokesman said that the new EU sanctions ignore the Russian leader's 'initiatives to end the bloodshed and achieve peaceful settlement of the conflict in southeast Ukraine'

Vladimir Putin today threatened Europe with 'retaliation' for new sanctions that hit its Kalashnikov gun-making plant as the West rushed to stockpile gas for winter amid fears Russia may turn off the tap.

The row over the new action, which hits energy giants and bans exports to the Kalashnikov gun-making plant, came amid new claims that Moscow has moved almost 100 armoured vehicles including tanks and Grad missile launchers onto Ukrainian territory.

'Regarding retaliatory measures, the government is thinking
about them, but only those that will create better conditions
for us will be applied,' he said after a meeting of the Shanghai
Cooperation Organisation security bloc.

'We won't do any damage to ourselves, he added in Dushanbe,
capital of the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan in Central
Asia.

Putin's spokesman said earlier that the new EU sanctions ignore the Russian leader's 'initiatives to end the bloodshed and achieve peaceful settlement of the conflict in southeast Ukraine'.

Brussels 'either does not see or does not want to see the real state of things', he said.

'Naturally, the sanctions are going to create a certain discomfort for the Russian side. At the same time, we cannot but understand that European companies and taxpayers will also have to pay a cost for these sanctions, which, in fact, is already happening,' he said.

Meanwhile, it emerged the EU's 28-member countries have been hurriedly stocking up on gas supplies for fear of a European energy crisis in the wake of the Ukraine crisis gripping the region.

Already Russia has cut off all gas supply to Ukraine since the crisis began with talks to resolve the row long-since collapsed. Ukraine has survived since June by using its gas reserves. But with winter fast approaching, they are running out.

'There is something very nasty building and as long as Russia continues to use gas as an instrument in its broader dispute with Ukraine, Europe's gas supplies will be under threat,' John Lough, a Russian expert at the Chatham House think-tank, told The Independent.

Alexander Temerko, a Ukrainian-born energy consultant, told the paper: 'Russia uses energy strategy much more effectively than military power. The energy threat is much more powerful and much more dangerous. Russia understands that the world can't find different sources of energy.'

If Russia were to halt gas supplies to its European neighbours, the result could prove catastrophic. Europe imports about a third of its gas from Russia, about half of which flows through Ukraine.

The widely trailed measures hit major energy giants Rosneft, Transneft, Gazprom Neft and three defence companies Oboronprom, United Aircraft Corporation and Uralvagonzavod which face curbs on raising finance in London and other EU capital markets.

Exports of dual-technology equipment balled to nine Russian defence companies, including Kalashnikov Concern, Russia's largest producer of automatic and sniper combat arms.

Two dozen prominent Russians were also named on the sanctions list including father and son pro-Kremlin politicians Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Igor Lebedev from the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party.

The list avoided naming any big name oligarchs with links to Britain but included pro-Moscow rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine.

Solidarity: Petro Poroshenko also said a new wave of European Union sanctions against Russia underlined Western solidarity with Kiev

Russia's envoy to the EU Vladimir Chizhov warned Moscow would hit back, with possible bans on imports of cars and textiles. Moscow may also ban Western airlines from overflying Siberia on routes to Asia.

Kiev military analyst Dmytro Tymchuk warned that Russia is now 'rotating' its troops in Ukraine. While some had left during the current ceasefire, more had arrived.

'We cannot yet rejoice that Russia is leaving Donbas,' he said.

The State Border Service of Ukraine reported almost 100 units of Russian combat equipment entering Ukraine including tanks, APCs and Grad missile launchers. 

Meanwhile, Ukraine's president said on Friday there could be no military solution to his country's crisis and said he hoped 'a very fragile' ceasefire in the east would hold, allowing him to focus on rebuilding the shattered economy.

Petro Poroshenko also said a new wave of European Union sanctions against Russia underlined Western solidarity with Kiev, and that the Ukrainian and EU parliaments could both ratify a deal on closer economic and political ties on Sept. 16.

Ukrainian forces have been battling pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine for five months in a conflict in which more than 3,000 people have been killed. The two sides have been broadly observing a ceasefire since last Friday, despite sporadic violations.

'There is no military solution for this crisis,' Poroshenko told EU and Ukrainian lawmakers and businessmen at the annual Yalta European Strategy conference - held in Kiev, not Yalta, due to Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in March.

'I hope the very fragile but efficient peace process which started exactly one week ago will have a continuation, for the (sake of) stable peace and security on the continent,' he said, speaking in English.

Poroshenko said Ukraine's 'association agreement' on closer EU ties, due to be ratified next week, provided a road map for the reforms that he said would be his top priority after parliamentary elections on Oct. 26, provided that peace holds in the east.

He said he had assembled a team of experts to help fight pervasive corruption, which he likened to 'a cancer' eating away at the foundations of the Ukrainian state, but that improving the security situation remained the paramount concern.

'Investors will come when they feel safe in this country. That is why we are reforming the very ineffective security system and army, our court system ... If we do not reform these things, even after the war, investors won't come,' he said.

'I know personally how harmful the state can be for the investment climate,' added Poroshenko, a billionaire former businessman once nicknamed the 'Chocolate King' for who making his fortune in confectionery.
