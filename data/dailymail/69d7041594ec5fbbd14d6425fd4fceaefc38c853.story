A drastic change in weather caused by a slow down in the Gulf Stream - as predicted in the box office hit, The Day After Tomorrow - could be more science fact than fiction, according to a new report.

While temperatures were recently set plunging across the US thanks to a polar vortex, the UK could be headed for warmer, drier weather in time for the summer, say scientists from Reading University.

They claim there has been a definite 10 to 15 per cent slowdown in the Gulf Stream, which brings a constant flow of warm water and mild weather to northern Europe - and the change could result in 'big impacts' on the weather system for years to come.

Here comes the sun: Britain's short heatwaves could be a thing of the past, with predictions the UK will experience warmer, drier summers

This exact scenario appears in the 2004 sci-fi blockbuster starring Jake Gyllenhall and Dennis Quaid, in which a shutdown of the North Atlantic currents plays havoc with the weather and sends temperatures plunging to a chilly minus 150C.

Previous scientific reports have also suggested a slowdown in the Gulf Stream would result in chillier temperatures around Europe and rising temperatures elsewhere.

But the latest findings from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science suggest Britain will actually experience drier summers, with a possibility of drought in Europe and Africa as temperatures rise.

There may also be fewer Atlantic hurricanes, as the strength of the Gulf Stream declines.

Lead author Dr Jon Robson, told The Sun on Sunday: 'In Britain we could see a return to drier summers, although it could also lead to more droughts in parts of Europe and Africa.

'However, there's quite a bit of uncertainty about how fast changes might happen.'

The prediction of drier summers is in direct contrast to Britain's current wet winter, which has caused widespread flooding for thousands across England and Wales.

There is however no need to pack away umbrellas just yet.

Research director Professor Rowan Sutton added the report is not a prediction for this summer or any other year, but is instead suggestive of a 'trend towards drier summers across the UK.'
