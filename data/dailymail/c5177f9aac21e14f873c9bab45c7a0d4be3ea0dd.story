At the time, you wouldn't bat an eyelid at hundreds of sheep clattering down Kendal high street in Cumbria.

But alas, cars came along - making this 1953 photo  a souvenir of a bygone era.

More than 60 years later, however, residents have been treated to a bizarre case of deja-vu as livestock filled the town for a re-enactment of the classic shot.

Deja-vu: This classic shot of sheep clattering through Kendal, Cumbria, (left) has been recreated (right) 

Throwback: The event was held more than 60 years after the 1953 picture to celebrate the town's wool trade

The photograph, called Kendal Rush Hour, was taken by Joseph Hardman in the Cumbria town.

It bears a stark difference to today's Kendal as cattle are transported in trucks. 

But in a celebration of the town's thriving wool trade, the photograph was yesterday recreated.

Hundreds gathered to watch 150 ewes chase each other down the street.

The stars of the modern version of the photo were a flock of rough fell sheep owned by South Lakes farmer Jane Knowles. 

Event: Hundreds lined the street in the centre of the Cumbrian town to celebrate the re-enactment

Excitement: It marked a momentary return to the scenes of a bygone era, which ended with the advent of cars

They were herded down Allhallows Lane at 9am on Sunday by shepherdess Alison O'Neil.

Westmoreland Agriculture Society chief executive Christine Knipe said: 'Sixty years ago it was an ordinary event.

'But today it was special and it was great to see how people embraced it'.
