Hundreds of angry Amazon customers have hit out at the online retailer after finding they were being charged £79 for Prime services without realising it. 

The furious shoppers spoke out after being hit with the yearly charge when their 30-day free trial expired, meaning the price was raised to the regular £79-a-year rate.

One Conservative councillor checked his Amazon account only to realise he had been paying for the service for five years without knowing, while another shocked subscriber said she was 'livid'. 

Amazon Prime customers have hit out after hundreds of customers complained that they had been charged £79-a-year for the service without realising it after their 30-day free trial expired

Hundreds of his followers responded saying they had been caught out after their free 30-day trial of Prime expired, meaning they were automatically upgraded to the £79-a-year service

All Amazon customers will be asked to sign up for a free 30-day trial of Amazon Prime at the site's digital checkout, offering them free one-day delivery on their purchases.

However, reading the small print reveals that after this 30-day trial ends, buyers will be charged the £79-a-year rate, which includes movie streaming services, among other things.

The unwitting subscribers were responding to a tweet by food critic and TV personality Giles Coren after he discovered he had been charged for the service for two years without using it.

On Sunday he messaged his 164,000 followers saying: 'You b******* Amazon! I can't believe you've been screwing me for £79 a year for Prime! I had no idea.

'I mean, Amazon offer a free trial in 2012, then quietly start charging £79 and never tell me. That's what sicko porn sites do! I've heard...'   

Outspoken Times columnist Giles Coren launched a rant against Amazon after discovering he had been charged for the Prime service for two years without knowing about it

Initially customers were billed £49 per year for the service, but this was hiked to £79 in February last year after Amazon bought LoveFilm and included access to it as part of the deal.

Jeremy Bellamy, a Conservative councillor for Barton in Canterbury, said: 'I noticed just after Christmas that they'd been charging me for it... for about the last four or five years I think?'

Amazon customers can tell if they've signed up to Prime by going to the My Account section of the site, located in the top right hand corner of the homepage.

Once there, scroll down the page until you see the 'Settings' section, then look under the 'Account settings' column for a option called 'Manage Prime Membership'.

Once you have clicked on that, a new page will open up, telling you whether you are signed up to Prime, how long you have been a member, and who is being charged.

If you want to end your membership, there will be a button on this page allowing you to do this.

If you think you have been wrongly charged for Prime, you can apply for a refund via the customer services page.

Lauranne Pearce, from Derbyshire, added: 'I've just checked and yep £79 lighter and didn't even know it. I can't even remember signing up!'

Meanwhile Sally Roberts, from London, said she was 'livid' after also being caught out.

Mr Coren, who has become known for his often savage restaurant reviews and rants against sub-editors of his column at The Times, added: 'Come on people, check your Amazon accounts.

'If you're being secretly f***** by 'Prime' let me know. It's a class action waiting to happen.'

Amazon has long received complaints over its practice of automatically charging customers after the free trial expired, with website moneysavingexpert.com speaking about it back in 2009.

In recent weeks the UK service has also been attacked for being the most expensive in Europe after it was revealed customers in Italy pay just £7.50 per year for Prime.

Amazon say that the UK Prime service includes access to hundreds of movies and TV shows to stream online, as well as online space for storing pictures, and the ability to borrow Kindle books.

The UK service also includes free one-day delivery on millions of items, while Italian Prime only includes free 2-3 day delivery.

However UK customers are not given the option of taking the cheaper service if they do not want to use all the features of UK Prime. 

Mr Coren branded Amazon 'highwaymen' and 'corporate rapists' after he discovered the charge, which is explained in the small print on Amazon's website (right)

An Amazon spokesman said: 'Customers who sign up to a free trial of Prime receive an email informing them of the duration of the free trial and how to avoid continuing to paid Prime Membership.

'Customers who become full Prime members can cancel their membership at any time and we will refund the full membership if the customer has not made any eligible purchases or used any Prime benefits.

'So as long as you haven’t used the free delivery, downloaded or streamed any videos through the service, or borrowed a Kindle book, you can simply cancel the membership and reclaim the subscription.'

Amazon did offer Mr Coren a refund online today after saying he had misunderstood the terms and conditions, but he refused, adding that he wasn't asking to be reimbursed, but was informing his followers of the practice.
