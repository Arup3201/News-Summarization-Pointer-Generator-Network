The Hemingway family were expecting a relaxing  Spanish getaway after spending more than £4,000 on a Thomson holiday.

In the glossy brochure the self-catering Levante Lux Apartments in Benidorm looked modern, comfortable and bright.

But when they arrived they were greeted by an unpleasant reality. They found 'punch holes' in three of the apartment doors, a loose sink and loose glass in the patio door.

The Hemingway family paid £4,800 to stay in the Levante Lux Apartments in Benidorm, pictured left. The family found rusty metal work and exposed wires, pictured right, in the grounds of the apartment block when they arrived.

They discovered mould, as well as damaged, unstable wardrobes in the bedroom.

The Hemingways - including diabetic dad Mark - were unable to use the cooker as all the shelves had been removed.

Outside, the family saw rusty metalwork and missing drain covers around the swimming pool - and they noticed that most of the sun loungers were broken.

Mr Hemingway complained to a Thomson rep and asked to be moved, but was told there were no vacancies elsewhere.

After enduring four nights in the damaged flat, the Spanish owners of the complex moved the party of five adults and three children from Huddersfield, to the nearby Levante Beach which was cleaner and in better repair.

The Hemingways have since been offered £307 compensation - but the family have turned it down believing they are entitled to £1,000 to cover their stay in the dilapidated apartment.

The family also discovered punch holes through three doors

Mr Hemingway, 43, said: 'It looked fantastic in the brochure. The lady who booked it with us said it was a nice apartment and building and that she'd never had any complaints.

The Thomson website says the Levante Lux Apartments 'combine the flexibility of self-catering with all the must-haves of a hotel.'

The apartments are described as 'modern spaces' that have been 'thoughtfully decorated.' 

 It adds: 'Simple whitewashed walls sport arty prints, while patterned soft furnishings keep things bright.

'All of them have good-sized kitchenettes, kitted out with all the self-catering essentials.'

'When we got there we thought we were in the wrong place,' said Mr Hemingway.

'The gates were rusty and had holes in them and the lights had exposed wires coming out of them.

Sharon and Mark Hemingway were offered £307 compensation by Thomson, but they have turned this down

'The front door of our apartment looked like it had been kicked in.

'When we eventually got moved they closed the rooms we were in to refurbish them.'

 'We were unable to have a holiday until we were moved; it caused us some distress,' said the glazer.

'I would never use Thomson again.'

A spokesman for Thomson said: 'Thomson is sorry to hear of Mr Hemingway's experience.

The Thomson website promises apartments that are 'modern spaces that have been thoughtfully decorated' 

Thomson says guests will find 'Simple whitewashed walls sport arty prints, while patterned soft furnishings keep things bright'

'Our team in the resort did everything possible to assist Mr Hemingway during his stay.

'Following a review of his complaint we have offered him a gesture of goodwill.

'We would like to reassure customers that this hotel remains a popular choice for our customers.'
