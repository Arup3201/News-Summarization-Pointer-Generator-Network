Leonardo Ulloa, Leicester City’s club-record signing, says he has drawn strength from his opening day goal against Everton that he can succeed in the Premier League.

The Argentinian striker drove home on his competitive debut to help his side claim a point and believes there is enough quality in Nigel Pearson’s squad to stay up.

Ulloa only has played one season of top-flight European football in his career, while at Almeria in La Liga, but earned his £8million move to Leicester after averaging a goal every other game for Brighton in the Championship.

‘It’s more confidence for me, this goal,’ he told the Leicester Mercury after the 2-2 draw with Everton. ‘I enjoy the Premier League because this is new for me. I enjoy it all the time, in training, during play, and for the team.

‘It is important for us and the strikers because it is more confidence for us. For me, it is important but it is also very important for the team. I want wins but I think the team played really well for the first game.’

Leicester are expected to encounter a tough season and Ulloa admitted he needed to adjust to the fast pace, but his physique and height ultimately proved a handful. He believes Leicester’s manner of performance bodes well.

‘It is different because there is more intensity than the Championship, but this team have quality and really good players,’ he added. ‘I don’t worry because we have a good team.

‘I enjoy the team, the club, I want to say thank you to the fans because I am really happy here.

‘I came here to play. I want to play, I want to help. Sometimes I can score goals, sometimes not, but I want to work all the time.’
