British families travelling to Disneyland Paris are paying up to £500 more than French visitors for identical holiday packages.

Customers trying to book a stay for two adults and two children on the UK site are being charged more than if they had go onto the French site, even though the details are exactly the same.

The huge price gap is based on a four-night stay break at the end of June, but packages throughout the summer are still between £300 and £400 more expensive.

Not so magical: British families are being charged more than the French for holidays to Disneyland Paris

For a stay at the five-star Disneyland Hotel, customers trying to book on the UK site are being charged £3,331.

However French customers are being offered £2,829, £502 less, for exactly the same deal, which includes meals, park entry and accommodating.

Then, if you try to book later in the summer holidays to get a better price, the problem is still the same.

A package for a stay between August 14 and 19 is £3,644 on the UK site, whereas it is £3,098 on the French site.

When British customers try and book their holidays through the official Disneyland site, they are being charged more than if they did it through the French site. The above price differences are based on a family of four staying for four nights between June 20 and 24

Rip off: For a four-night stay at the Disneyland Hotel, customers are being charged £500 more when using the UK site. The deals include meals, park entry and accommodation

Expensive: British families are being charged £324 more than the French for identical packages at the Newport Bay Hotel

In the mid-range Newport Bay Hotel, the difference is as much as £326, while British customers are being charged £400 more at the Hotel Santa Fe.

The price gap even affected the resort's cheapest accommodation, Hotel Cheyenne, where a deal at the end of June is £354 more expensive for British customers.

French children have longer school holidays than in Britain, making bookings in August very competitive. 

This means that Disneyland have the opportunity to hike the prices during certain periods.

Cheap: French visitors are being offered £354 less for a package at the end of June at the Hotel Cheyenne

One British mother  noticed the difference in prices and found a way to get around it.

Chloe Burgin rang the UK office and was told she could not get the French deal.

But when she phoned the Paris-based office and asked to talk to someone who spoke English, she was given a better offer.

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'They
 couldn’t be more helpful,' she said. 'Not only were we able to book the
 package, they gave us a better hotel for the same price.' 

Mail Online have contacted Disneyland Paris for comment.

Around 2.1million of the 14.9million annual visitors to the park are British.
