An architect has thought outside the box to house the homeless - by designing them shelters inside billboards which pay for themselves through advertising revenue.

Slovak Michal Polacek came up with the idea for the small roadside accommodation, complete with giant images and neon lights on the outside, for a programme called Project Gregory.

Mr Polacek, and fellow designers Matej Nedorolik and Martin Lee Keniz, are seeking to raise £41,000 on Kickstarter to fund the first prototype home and test out their novel idea.

Slovak architect Michal Polacek came up with the idea for the small roadside accommodation, complete with giant images and neon lights on the outside, as a novel way to get people off the streets in his home country

The design of the rectangular shaped homes is not just functional and allows for all the modern comforts

And all they ask is one pound from each donor to help turn their dream into a reality and help get people sleeping rough off the streets.

Mr Polacek said: 'Through our campaign at Kickstarter people from all around the world can also contribute to the realization of Project Gregory.

'It is based on the same principle as when you give a piece of food or a coin to people without a home.'

So far the team has yet to raise the bulk of the funds for their novel approach in getting the homeless a roof over their head, but it's early days and the online fundraiser still has 41 days left.

And although they plan to start off their project in their home country of Slovakia, Mr Polacek believes their plan in thinking outside the box' has the potential to go global.

The designers say the revenue from the advertising on the outside would cover all the maintenance costs

'When everyone who is interested in our idea will give us £1 we will be closer to help people without a home and soon Project Gregory can spread into other countries.

'Now is the best time to make big changes and everyone can participate.'

The trio of designers want to give the homeless more than just a roof and four walls, however, and the living spaces would be smart and modern on the inside complete with plenty of home comforts.

The billboard homes would maximise all the space inside the wooden-built shelters the designers planned

And to pay for the day-to-day maintenance costs and utility bills, the rectangular billboard homes would cover themselves through money brought in from renting the outside walls to advertisers.

Mr Polacek said: 'If we take the electricity cost needed for the billboard to keep it lit at night and we try to optimize it by x%, we find this saved energy could fully cover all interior usage needs.'

The novel billboard homes would be built with wooden joists set into a concrete base.

For now, Mr Polacek and his team are hoping the public will pitch in for their Kickstarter campaign in their goal to raise £41,000 needed to get the novel shelter to the homeless off the ground.
