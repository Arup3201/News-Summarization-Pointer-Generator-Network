Closing speech: Jurors are almost ready to consider verdicts on veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis, pictured

Dave Lee Travis is the victim of a witch hunt by police who were desperate to find a scapegoat after missing Jimmy Savile's crimes, a court has heard.

The veteran DJ's defence barrister told a jury today that convicting Travis of 14 sex crimes would not 'right the wrongs' of the Savile scandal.

'Police and the authorities missed Jimmy Savile,' said Stephen Vullo in his closing speech at Southwark Crown Court. 'They missed him.

'In any society when something goes wrong, a harvest fails, there is a reaction, an understandable reaction.

'Nobody wants sexual predators to get away with their crimes.

'Everybody
 wants them to be brought to justice but there is no justice whatsoever 
in overreaction, bringing a 68-year-old man of impeccable character to 
this court and muddying his name to make us feel better about Jimmy 
Savile.

'It wouldn't right that wrong.'

Travis, a former presenter of the BBC's Radio 1 breakfast show, is on trial under his birth name David Griffin accused of 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault against a total of 11 women.

The charges date back as far as 1976 when he was at the height of his fame and include periods when he was working as a BBC DJ, as a 
broadcaster with Classic Gold radio, while appearing on Top of the Pops 
and when starring in panto.

Accusing the authorities of a 'witch hunt', Mr Vullo said his client's reputation was 'already finished' despite no verdict yet being reached by the court.

Scapegoat: Jurors heard today that Travis (left with Jimmy Savile in 1980) is the victim of a 'witch hunt' by police who were desperate for scapegoats after missing Savile's sex crimes. Both were high-profile DJs

High-profile: Travis (left) and Savile were well-known BBC music presenters. Savile died before he could be brought to trial, and after his death hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse began to emerge

He told the jury the 'person who started this' - the first woman who went to police and said Travis assaulted her in the Radio 1 studio - 'lied to you at length and in detail'.

'It's not unfair for me to say at this stage that that's where the witch hunt begins,' he added. 'It began with a total lie.'

He added: 'It's so unfair to have an accusation made against you many years after the incident.'

The barrister said although the prosecution say that none of the alleged victims are motivated by money or fame, 'we just don't know what people are going to do after this case has finished'.

Referring to the four assaults alleged to have taken place while Travis worked at Classic Gold Radio in the early 2000s, Mr Vullo said they had been 'blown out of all proportion'.

Of one woman, Mr Vullo said: 'Mr Griffin accepts he maybe touched her leg because he was close to her in an argument.

'She went ballistic and went mad and people remember that happening and that's what people remember, but not how she says.

'Nobody has given evidence of having received a complaint from her that he put his "hand up my skirt and in my knickers".'

He said the woman was known for particularly liking her personal space while he said of Travis: 'He is as has been described - a big cuddly bear who is very tactile.'

Earlier, prosecutor Miranda Moore QC presented her closing speech - in which she branded Travis a 'dirty old man'.

She asked jurors to consider whether the BBC was a 'utopia' when Travis worked there.

She said: 'Was the BBC a utopia where women were free from unwanted attention, where the DJs behaved - apart from Savile?

'Where there were no rumours of untoward behaviour - apart from Savile? Where every complaint was dealt with properly?'

Ms Moore said the trial had heard from witnesses who said this was not the case and told the jury of eight women and four men to 'bring your scepticism' to the case.

'This utopia that was the BBC where no girls ever felt that they were being sexually harrassed or anything was untoward,' she said. 'I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but my expression to that is "Oh please."'

Ms Moore told jurors not to focus on the 'morality' of what was acceptable in the 1970s and 80s, because Travis has denied the assaults completely, rather than pinning them on a misogynistic industry.

She added it was a 'criminal trial and not a feminist rant by me as to a culture that existed at a particular point of time that some of us lived through'.

She also told jurors that although the courts regularly deal with more 'horrific cases', it was not their job to 'judge degrees of guilt'.

Referring to the most recent alleged assault, where it is claimed Travis grabbed a journalist's breasts as if to check their size, Ms Moore said it sounded like a Carry On film, but this did not mean it was not serious.

Ms Moore told jurors to forget about Travis's fame and treat him as a 'normal member of the public, no more nor less'.

'His celebrity might have given him protection in the past,' she said.

Judge Anthony Leonard is due to sum up the case tomorrow before the jury retires to consider its verdict.
