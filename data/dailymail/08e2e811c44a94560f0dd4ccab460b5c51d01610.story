Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has had a long and frustrating history struggling with the zipper on his trademark coats.

But Wenger's jacket drama looks set to be a thing of the past as Arsenal's new kit suppliers Puma have designed a revolutionary new coat for the Gunners boss. 

Puma, who replaced Nike after a 20-year partnership with the club, have released a new advert featuring the Frenchman modelling his new garment.

Puma claim to have studied Wenger's hand movements to create their new zipper and were pleased with the resuts. 'We reckon we nailed it,' says a voiceover in the advert. I think so, too,' Wenger replies. 

The Frenchman looks genuinely chuffed with his space-age zipper but Wenger may want to stick to the day job after this brief acting cameo. 

Wenger looks a bit manic, with wide bulging eyes, as he finally manages to do up the zip on his coat.

He will hope to lead Arsenal to victory over Anderlecht on Tuesday, although will be without Jack Wilshere, who is ill.
