Luis Suarez scored his first goal for Barcelona and in doing so opened the way for Lionel Messi to rewrite the history books once again, with a hat-trick that took him past Raul as the Champions League all-time top-scorer.

Barça were struggling to break down a stubborn APOEL defence when Suarez spun away from his marker and buried a shot into the far corner of Urko Pardo's net after 27 minutes. It was the goal that lifted the weight of not having scored in his first five games from his shoulders…it also opened the Messi floodgates.

Last week Messi told Argentine newspaper Olé he would like to stay at Barcelona for the rest of his career but that 'players don't always get what they want'. What sane of mind president would sanction his sale after his latest landmark performances?

The 27-year-old is now Barcelona's all-time top scorer; the Spanish league's all-time top scorer; and the Champions League's all-time top scorer, too. And such is the 27-year-old's genius that he has broken each one of those records by scoring a hat-trick.

He bagged a treble against Granada last season to become the club's all-time leading scorer; he got three against Sevilla at the weekend to top La Liga's all time list; and he surpassed Raul's record 72-goal haul with three more against the Cypriot champions.

He moved past Real Madrid legend Raul when he diverted a Jordi Alba shot past APOEL keeper Urko Pardo. He doubled his tally in the second half converting an Alves pass and then made it 4-0 from Pedro's cross to put him on 74 goals in 91 games.

The Messi-show began after Suarez broke down APOEL's well-marshalled defence. Their keeper Pardo had saved from Messi after just two minutes and when Alves blasted over the keeper's bar from distance on ten minutes it was a symptom of the visitors' growing frustration.

Suarez spurned a glorious chance on 18 minutes when Messi wriggled down the right and crossed. But the former Liverpool striker had to get his shot away quickly in a packed area and it went tamely straight at Pardo.

Messi then teed-up Alba with a perfectly lofted pass but the full-back sent his shot over from the edge of the six-yard box. Barcelona were enjoying over 70 per cent of possession but still could not find a way through.

Then finally the breakthrough came as Suarez turned away from his marker down the left-hand channel and finished into Pardo's far corner. The tension lifted, both for him and his team-mates.

Messi turned in Alba's shot to make it 2-0 and then back-heeled to Suarez who went for power over precision and sent his shot wide. The Argentine then chased 30 yards back to win possession as Barcelona finished the half strongly. He was in the mood for more goals and duly delivered them after the break, first from Alves' pass and then after good work from Pedro.

Messi also set up Suarez who missed the chance to double his tally and when with 20 minutes Rafinha was harshly sent off, Suarez was replaced by Sergi Busquets as Luis Enrique looked to compensate for going a man down.

Messi completed his hat-trick and not even a Dani Alves booking – meaning he misses Barcelona's last group game at home to Paris Saint-Germain – could ruin the night. Guilherme was later sent off for APOEL as the home side failed to grab a consolation goal.

Barça will miss their Brazilian full back in the last game that they have to win to qualify as group leaders. But, full of confidence after the final whistle, Suarez said: 'We know how strong Paris [Saint-Germain] are but we are at home so it is in our hands to win the game and top the group.'
