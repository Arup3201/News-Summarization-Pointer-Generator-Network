Vine videos are a relatively new phenomenon but the idea of making short moving pictures dates back as far as the early 19th century.

In 1829, a Belgian physicist invented the phenakistoscope, or 'spindle viewer' as a toy for his sons. It spun images around an axis making them appear to move when looked at in a mirror.

The images depicted traditional scenes, including couples dancing and horses jumping, to more abstract clips such as men diving into the mouths of lions, and now artist Richard Balzer has created digital versions of these stunning animations. 

Still images were drawn onto a disc 
and each image was slightly different, in the same way images are drawn 
on the pages of a flip book.

This disc was attached to another that had slits cut around it and both were attached to an axis in the centre.

The disc with the images on was held 
in front of a mirror and was spun around this axis. When looked at in 
the mirror, the images appeared to move in circles.

The toy was created by blind scientist Joseph Plateau at the same time Austrian Simon von Stampfer designed an identical device called the stroboscope. 

Still images were drawn onto a disc and each image was slightly different, in the same way images are drawn on the pages of a flip book.

This disc was attached to another that had slits cut around it and both were attached to an axis in the centre.

The disc with the images on was held in front of a mirror and was spun around this axis. When looked at in the mirror, through the slits, the images appeared to move in circles. 

The 
phenakistoscope was also referred to as the Phantasmascope and 
Fantoscope and was ultimately replaced by William George Horner's zoetrope.

A zoetrope is different because the images are fitted inside a spinning wheel and users peer through the slits in the side of the toy.

This means more than one person can see the moving images for various angles.

Although the toy was invented before Queen Victoria took to the throne, it became popular during her reign.

Plateau's design was based on the work of Michael Faraday and his 'Faraday's Wheel', which spun two discs in opposite directions to create an electrical charge from a magnetic field. 

The phenakistoscope toy, pictured left, was 
created by blind scientist Joseph Plateau and showed moving images in a 
mirror. It was ultimately replaced by the zoetrope, pictured right, that
used the same principles but the images are instead fitted inside a 
wheel and can be viewed by multiple people from different angles

It used the principle of 'persistence of motion' in which images are used in such a way to create an illusion of motion.

A later, handheld version of Plateau's design was created in which the discs were separated, thus removing the need for a mirror.

Examples of scenes, depicted on the original phenakistoscope, include a couple dancing and horses jumping over fences. 

Others show jesters performing star jumps as red and yellow birds fly near their heads, frogs hopping around a circle of grass blowing in the wind, and magpies bouncing on top of people's heads as the people are showing eating small blue balls.

There are also kaleidoscopic phenakistoscopes that use geometric shapes to create a hypnotic effect, and more surreal images of men climbing ladders into the mouth of the Moon, or diving into the mouths of lions.
