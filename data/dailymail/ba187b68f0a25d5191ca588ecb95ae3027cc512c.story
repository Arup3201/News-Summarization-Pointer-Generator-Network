Horrifying: Michael McMullen died after being wrapped up in a blanket as a punishment

Three babysitters watched as a three-year-old boy died in a cruel punishment called 'The Wrap' - where he suffocated after being tightly covered in a blanket.

Michael Lee McMullen died after being wrapped in six layers of blankets at the Florida home he was living in.

Manslaughter charges were filed against Donella Trainor, 45; Douglas Garrigus, 21; and the child's grandmother, Gale Watkins, 56, according to a Lee County Sheriff's lieutenant.

Trainor, a friend of the boy's grandmother, told investigators she had disciplined her own grandchildren that way, using a technique all three adults knew as 'the wrap,' Lieutenant Larry King said.

He said she pinned the boy's arms to his side and rolled him in a king-sized blanket.

'There were six layers of cloth over this child. The loose ends would be folded over his head and feet and tied into a knot, all in an effort to prevent the child from moving,' King said.

'You could use a mummy reference.'

The boy, Michael Lee McMullen, screamed and pleaded to be released as Trainor wrapped him and put him in his crib for a nap on Saturday, the sheriff's report said.

The boy's grandmother, and his stepfather, Garrigus, checked on him at 
different times as he cried and struggled, the report said.

Manslaughter charges were also filed against Donella Trainor, 45

At one point, Garrigus said he could hear the boy crying and hyperventilating, the sheriff's office said.

Trainor returned, found the knot loose and retied it, then put pillows around the child, the report said.

She later found him unresponsive and soaked in sweat, it said.

Paramedics took him to a hospital in Fort Myers on Florida's southwest coast where he was declared dead, and the medical examiner classified the death as a homicide.

The exact cause was still pending, King said.

Trainor, Watkins and Garrigus were charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child.

Trainor, 45, was also charged with aggravated child abuse 'for the torture and unlawful caging' of the boy, King said

Watkins had custody of her grandson because the child's mother had been involved in domestic violence, and Trainor was helping her care for him, King said.

All three suspects were arrested and jailed on Tuesday.

Bond was set on Wednesday at $300,000 for Trainor and $250,000 each for Watkins and Garrigus.
