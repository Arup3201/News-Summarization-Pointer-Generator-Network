Given it's been stolen, spray-painted and attacked with a cup of tea, touching the Mona Lisa is one of the rarest treats in the world.

But there's now an easy way to get hands-on with da Vinci's masterwork - after a gallery introduced a 3D version for the blind.

A replica of the 16th Century portrait, whose real-life counterpart is behind bulletproof glass in the Louvre, is at Madrid's Prado Museum in a bid to inspire art-lovers with a new perspective.

Five other classics are represented by artists including Italian master Antonio da Correggio, Spaniard Diego Velázquez and the Romantic painter Francisco Goya.

Visitors are free to touch the works, with audio guides and braille descriptions to add to the experience - while fully-sighted guests can join in by donning blackout glasses.

Painted from around 1503, the real Mona Lisa was stolen in 1911 and is now one of the world's best-protected artworks.

Vandals threw rocks and acid at the work in 1956 and in 2009 a Russian tourist hurled a cup of English Breakfast tea - which shattered harmlessly on its protective glass box.

Where's the bulletproof glass? Art-lovers can finally touch the Mona Lisa - a replica at least - at the Prado Museum in the Spanish capital

Hands-on: A blind man feels the Mona Lisa. Fully-sighted visitors can join in by donning blackout glasses, and there are braille explanations

Feeling her way: A blind woman touches a copy of Apollo in the Forge of Vulcan of Diego Velázquez, one of six works in the exhibition

I feel it in my 'art: The exhibition, Touch The Prado, includes The Gentleman With his Hand on his Chest by El Greco

Change: A gallery spokesman said the project aimed to introduce a new emotional depth to the way we look at art, sighted people included

Raised: The layered replica paintings were made using a relief printing technique called Didú, which builds volume and texture on the works

My hand on yours: A close-up of a blind person touching The Gentleman With his Hand on his Chest

Variety: A replica of Still Life with Artichokes, Flowers and Glass Vessels by 17th Century Spanish painter Juan Van Der Hamen

Disobedience: One blind visitor gets his hands on a work by Antonio da Correggio - suitably entitled Don't Touch Me

Famous: The sprawling Prado Museum is in the centre of Madrid and is Spain's equivalent of England's National Gallery in Trafalgar Square
