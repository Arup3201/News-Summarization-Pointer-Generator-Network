The country’s most senior prosecutor 
last night denied being ‘on a mission’ to bring down celebrities as she 
came under fire over a string of failed court cases.

Alison
 Saunders defended the Crown Prosecution Service against claims that it 
was ‘star struck’ and had ‘lost perspective’ in wrongly pursuing famous 
suspects.

She said it was 
right to prosecute MP Nigel Evans, who was cleared of rape and a string 
of other sex charges on Thursday – despite several of his ‘accusers’ 
telling the police they did not believe they were victims.

Former DPP Lord Macdonald said prosecutors must not lose perspective

Mrs Saunders said ‘victims may not 
always think of themselves as victims’ and used cases involving grooming
 as an example. She also pointed out an 86 per cent prosecution success 
rate across all cases.

But last night, detailed figures on sex attacks provided by the CPS showed those prosecutions have a much lower success rate.

Some
 63 per cent of rape cases ended in a conviction in 2011/12, meaning 
more than one in three defendants walked free. The success rate was 
slightly higher for sexual offences, at 77 per cent, but nearly one in 
four cases still ended in a not guilty verdict. Mrs Saunders came under 
fire from her predecessor as Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord 
Macdonald of River Glaven, QC, who said prosecutors needed to ‘keep a 
cool head’ when approaching historical abuse cases. He told The Times: 
‘We don’t want prosecutors only to bring sure-fire winners, that way 
lots of guilty people would never be taken to court.

‘The
 more challenging cases need to be prosecuted too, so that the courts 
can decide. What the CPS need to avoid, however, is going on a mission 
and losing perspective. This particularly applies to historical cases 
which have garnered a lot of publicity. You have to keep a cool head.’

The
 Evans verdict followed not guilty decisions in the cases of Coronation 
Street stars Bill Roache and Michael Le Vell. During Mr Evans’s trial, 
the court heard three of his seven alleged victims did not consider an 
offence had been committed against them, a fourth ‘had a bit of a 
giggle’ about the MP’s supposed assault, while a fifth wanted to 
withdraw his allegation about what he called ‘a drunken 
misunderstanding’.

Mrs 
Saunders pointed to evidence from the charity Barnardo’s that suggested 
those who are ‘groomed’ may not think they are victims because their 
abusers ‘love them and take care of them’.

However,
 the charity said its research applied only to child victims, and all 
the ‘victims’ in the Evans case were adults. Mrs Saunders said the CPS 
had made the ‘right decision’ to take the Evans case before the court 
and denied prosecuting ‘weak’ cases.

She
 told the BBC: ‘We apply the same test no matter who the offender or the
 victim is, and it’s very important that we do that. So I certainly 
don’t think that the CPS has been star struck in any way. We looked at 
all the evidence and decided there was a realistic prospect of 
conviction. And what we have to remember is that juries apply a very 
different, much higher test, which is – are they satisfied beyond all 
reasonable doubt?’

A married Tory activist, brought to court as one of Nigel Evans' alleged victims, has told of his astonishment that he had to give evidence about an incident that was simply a 'bit of a laugh'

‘What
 we do know, and there is evidence from Barnardo’s and others that shows
 this, is that victims themselves may not always think of themselves as 
victims, it rather depends on the relationship they are in with their 
alleged abusers. So if someone is in a position of power, or perhaps we 
have seen it in grooming cases where victims think they are not victims 
because their abusers love them and take care of them.

‘So I think we should be very careful just to say, “people don’t think they are victims and therefore they are not”.’

Former
 prisons minister Crispin Blunt told Sky News there were ‘no winners in 
this process’ and called for the CPS to examine their procedures.

Former
 Labour Justice Secretary Jack Straw told Sky News that before the 
revelations about Jimmy Savile, public figures ‘got the benefit of the 
doubt’.

‘I think probably these days if you are a public figure then the balance is going to swing the other way,’ he said.

Speaking
 at the end of the trial, Nigel Evans said he had 'gone through 11 
months of hell' after he was cleared of committing nine sexual offences 
against seven young men.

Outside
 Preston Crown Court, Evans said: 'Can I first start by passing on my 
condolences to one of the jurors whose father died during the trial. My 
deepest condolences to him and his family.

'Can I also thank my legal team....I thank them for their support during this trial.

'As many of you know I've gone through 11 months of hell.

'I've
 not been alone. Many have walked with me including my team at Clitheroe
 and Westminster, my constituency association, my family, my friends, my
 constituents and indeed many people who I don't even know have sent 
messages of support.

'In
 my darkest and loneliest times, there were only two or one set of 
footprints in the sand. Those of you of faith will know, they weren't 
mine.

'The fact is I've
 got work to do. It's the work that I've done for the last 22 years so 
this isn't a time for celebration or euphoria.

'Bill
 Roache just a few weeks ago from this very spot said there are no 
winners in these cases and that's absolutely right there are no winners,
 so no celebrations.

'But
 the fact is I've got work to do, work that I've done for the last 22 
years. All I can say is that after the last 11 months that I've gone 
through, nothing will ever be the same again.'
