Five gang members kidnapped a man and plotted to kill and bury him to get back at his prosecutor daughter for sending their friend to prison for life, authorities 
have revealed.

Frank Janssen, a 63-year-old military contractor, was found unharmed in an Atlanta apartment by an FBI rescue team on Wednesday night - five days after he vanished from his North Carolina home.

On Thursday, the FBI revealed they were able to rescue him after monitoring phone conversations indicating that the kidnappers planned to kill him and wipe the apartment clean of evidence.

'He spent five nights in the hands of a group of very dangerous people,' Special Agent John Strong said. 'We can only imagine the uncertainty, confusion and fear he experienced.'

The abduction was apparently related to work by his 
daughter, Wake County Assistant District Attorney Colleen Janssen, officials said at Thursday's press conference.

It related to the life sentence of 49-year-old Kelvin Melton, a habitual felon who was convicted in October 
2012 of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill in September 2011, records show.

Colleen Janssen prosecuted his case in
 2012 and he was sentenced to life in prison.

'Revenge': They were allegedly acting on behalf of Kelvin Melton, who was jailed for assault in 2012

A federal law enforcement 
official said communications between the alleged kidnappers suggested 
that those involved - who are between the ages of 19 and 21 - were linked to the gang the Bloods.

On
 April 5, a heavy-set 
woman knocked on Frank Janssen's front door in Wake Forest, North 
Carolina and when he answered, he was assaulted with a stun gun and 
kidnapped, 
authorities said.

After the kidnapping, his wife received a text message saying he had been 
taken to Georgia in the trunk of a car and was going to California afterwards, WNCN reported.

Authorities
 say the kidnappers threatened to torture him and sent 'specific 
demands' to his wife, as well as a photo of him tied up. The demands 
were not revealed.

In
 other messages, they told her that Janssen would be tortured, chopped up and 
sent to her in six boxes if she told police.

However, after finding drops of blood outside her home, she had contacted authorities.

The
 FBI said a coordinated investigation 
by the FBI, Wake Forest police and other law enforcement agencies 
determined that Janssen had been the victim of a kidnapping and was 
being held in an apartment complex in Atlanta's southeast section.

Janssen was safely rescued by the highly trained team at about 11.55pm on Wednesday, FBI spokeswoman Shelley Lynch said.

FBI agents remained at the apartments 
after sunrise on Thursday. Two doors, which seemed to be charred from 
fire or explosives, lay in the apartment courtyard. 

The investigation in the kidnapping case is
 ongoing, but five people have been charged with federal kidnapping 
charges. The maximum sentence is life.

Clifton James Roberts, 19, Jenna Paulin 
Martin, 21, Tiana Maynard, 20, Jevante Price, 20, and Michael Montreal 
Gooden, 21, have been arrested in the case.

Taken: He was hit by a stun gun and kidnapped from his home in North Carolina, pictured, on April 5. His wife returned to find spots of blood and later received texts saying he was going to be tortured

'Both
 Mr. Janssen and his family have remained strong and focused throughout 
this ordeal,' Strong said. 'The Janssen family wishes to express their 
sincere appreciation to all those who helped to bring Mr. Janssen home 
safely.'

The
 FBI describes its Hostage Rescue Team as a national level 
counterterrorist unit, offering a tactical option for any extraordinary 
hostage crisis or other law enforcement situation in the U.S.

It adds that the unit, established in 1983, responds to the most urgent and complex FBI cases.
