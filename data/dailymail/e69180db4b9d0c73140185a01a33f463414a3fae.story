A highly-sexualised music video of an 11-year-old girl dancing in skimpy clothing and taking part in a mock execution has provoked a furious response from parents with some campaigners calling for the music director to be 'banned from working with children.'

The video, which has been released on YouTube, features the American singer and actress Alison Gold whose parents are funding her already controversial music career.

Titled Shush Up, the clip appears to 
cover every topic which is inappropriate for a pre-pubescent girl including 
underage sexuality, crime, bondage, childbirth, strip club style 
dancing, sexy nurses, police arrest, incarceration and death by 
execution.

A highly-sexualised music video of an 11-year-old girl dancing in skimpy clothing and taking part in a mock execution has been branded the 'the creepiest video of all time'

The video, which has been released on YouTube, features the American singer and actress Alison Gold whose parents are funding her music career

The music video, which was posted online this week, sees Gold leap about in a series of shiny two piece outfits, wearing heavy make-up and batting outsized eyelashes.

It was produced by Patrice Wilson, CEO of Ark Music, who also put together the notorious viral hit Friday, by teen singer Rebecca Black - she eventually left school due to bullying.

Within hours of the video's release a petition was set up on change.org demanding that Mr Wilson 'stay away from little girls'.

One outrage voter wrote on the petition: 'As a father of an 11 year old girl, this is absolutely disgusting,' while another said: 'This man is a disgusting exploiter of young girls.'

Vivienne Pattison, director of pressure group Mediawatch-UK said: 'She is a bit of a victim here - she is not old enough to have made an informed decision.

Since the video premiered, a petition has been set up on change.org demanding that Mr Wilson 'stay away from little girls'. Left Alison Gold in a normal shot and right her make-up in the controversial video

The video appears to cover every topic which is inappropriate for a pre-pubescent girl including underage sexuality, crime, bondage, childbirth, strip club style dancing, sexy nurses, police arrest, incarceration and death by execution

'It is the same old thing that 
children are being taught - their values lie in their sexuality and if 
you want to have value in our society you have to look this way, behave 
this way.

Ms Pattinson explained that even if the video was deleted as many campaigners are calling for,  it may be too late:

'The point is its out there and it exists in the digital sphere and that's it - it is stored somewhere for the future.

'As much as I wish they didn't exist it's very hard to get them off the internet - a digital footprint is hard to erase.'

The YouTube comment section under the video has also been inundated with outraged viewers and had over a 1,000 dislikes.

One user wrote: 'She's so young. This is bordering on child pornography, ' while another wrote: 'What kind of parents allow this?'

The video begins with Alison Gold 
apparently robbing a jewellery store, after which she is held up by 
gun-toting police, handcuffed and taken off to hospital where she gives 
birth to a doll-baby and is looked after by nurses who carry
 outsized syringes.

In between scenes, females dressed like strippers do lots of dancing in the corridor of a prison or police cell.

Producer of the Alison Gold music video, Ark Music CEO Patrice Wilson, who makes a cameo as a prisoner visited by Gold, defended himself sgainst heavy criticism, saying it was 'art'

Alison
 goes to a club, where lots of young people, who are nevertheless at 
least twice her age, are dancing and stroking each other.

She is then featured in a orange prison jumpsuit sitting in an electric chair watched by weeping relatives.

A prison official asks, 'Any last words?' and she replies, 'Gold is the new black'.

A switch is flipped, and then she appears to lurch in death throes as the cap on the electric chair crackles and glows.

But Wilson, who has a cameo in the clip, playing the orange-suited prisoner Gold visits in a police lock-up has defended the video saying it was 'art'.

'To everyone concerned about the music video — Shush Up — it’s pure art, and it’s no different than a Willow Smith video or the 10-year-old dancer, Kaycee Rice,' Wilson told website Moshnews. 

'It’s no different from watching Dance Moms, dancing with their kids or Toddlers and Tiaras. This video is simply art and in my opinion, has a lot of creative elements to it.'

Unsavory: Alison Gold is pictured singing in the video to the Ark Music-produced Chinese Food which has now gone viral

He said the the young singers' family had asked for an 'edgier' video than her last offering.

'It was a song I wrote in December last year while I was in Ireland. Alison and her family wanted something more different and edgier.

'We were going to do a remake of a Bobby Brown song, however we decided to go with a more powerful dance song. Then I decided to write a video story that had a powerful meaning to it. It was a fun shoot and took about one full month to film.'

Not much is known about Alison Gold -  her Twitter states 'Alison Gold is an 11 year old American singer, actress and dancer. She was born on May 9, 2002 in Fairfax, VA. She got discovered by Patrice Wilson in 2012.'

Last year, Alison stirred up controversy 
with the video release of a song called Chinese Food,  supposedly the 
young singer's ode to the joys of Oriental cuisine.
