Keep fit: Harry Redknapp jogs for about half an hour several times a week to stay in shape

Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp has told how he knew he was in trouble when he felt chest pains while running on a treadmill.

Speaking at his Dorset home where he is recovering, Mr Redknapp revealed how he felt his chest tighten and 'struggled to breathe'.

The 64-year-old, who lives in Sandbanks,
Bournemouth, was in 'excellent spirits' this week after undergoing 
heart surgery to widen his narrowed arteries.

Yesterday, he told The Sun how the 
scare - which he described as a 'warning sign from within' - would not 
stop him running and vowed to one day complete the marathon.Â 

He even pledged to be back at work 'within a couple of weeks' and reassured supporters that the heart trouble would not stop him doing the job he loves.

Mr Redknapp, who has been taking pills for his narrow arteries, told the newspaper he jogs for about half an hour several times a week to stay in shape.

But on the day of the scare he'd only been running for a couple of minutes when he felt his chest constrict and stopped immediately.

London-born Mr Redknapp, who has been in charge of the White Hart Lane club for three years, said he went to see the Spurs doctor and then a specialist on Saturday before going into hospital on Monday.

The grandfather, who does not smoke and rarely drinks, said he was 'sort of half conscious' while surgeons inserted two metal 'stents' to widen his arteries and improve blood flow.

The father to football pundit Jamie and model Mark insisted he had not had a heart attack and said the surgery was 'no big deal'.

He said: 'I love my football and wont be walking away any time soon. I can assure everyone I'm doing OK.'

However, now out of hospital, he joked his wife Sandra is 'already fed up with me being back at home' and said his many get well messages had really cheered him up.

Mr Redknapp, who also had stints at West Ham United, Portsmouth and Southampton, added: 'I have only been in hospital - and there are people in there dying and suffering far worse than me.'

He recalled the danger to his life in 1990 when he was pulled from the wreckage of a car crash during the World Cup in Italy.

Five people, including AFC Bournemouth's managing director Brain Tiler were killed.

Stress: Mr Redknapp insists he looks after himself despite his stressful job on the touchline

Mr Redknapp was resigned to watching Group A leaders Spurs lose 1-0 to Russian side Rubin Kazan on the television last night.

Assistant manager Kevin Bond and 
first-team coach Joe Jordan took charge of the team for the match.

Mr Redknapp, who insists he looks after himself despite his stressful job, makes the 250-mile round trip to the club's Essex training ground most days.

He admitted in March 2010 that he had started talking heart pills 
upon the advice of his doctors, but stressed it was not a major problem.

Writing
in his Sun column at the time, Mr Redknapp said: 'About a year ago I needed to 
take heart pills and I am still taking them regularly.

'I am absolutely
fine and have no worries about my health but this game can make the 
most mild-mannered of people explode as when you are sitting on the 
bench you get eaten up inside from first to last whistle.'

On the stresses of management he 
added: 'After a game I cannot sleep, there is too much going on in my 
head as I go over moves, think about game plans, think about which 
player has had a good or bad game - and it's worse if you lose.'

Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson had a pacemaker fitted in 2004

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said earlier this week: 'We are delighted the operation went so smoothly and successfully.

'Knowing Harry he will want to rush back, but it's important that he only does so when he has recovered properly.'

Mr Redknapp is not the first football manager in recent times to have undergone heart surgery.

Gerard Houllier had to have an 
11-hour emergency aortic dissection after experiencing heart problems at
half-time during Liverpool's game against Leeds in 2001, and the 
Frenchman required a similar operation last season when in charge of 
Aston Villa.

The former Lyon manager, 64, returned to manage Liverpool after five months
out, but he did not take charge of another game at Villa following his 
most recent heart scare and left the Midlands club in the summer.

And Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson had a pacemaker fitted in 2004, but was back at work the following day.

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce underwent
heart surgery while in charge of Blackburn in 2009, and Joe Kinnear had
a triple-heart bypass earlier in the same year while at Newcastle.
