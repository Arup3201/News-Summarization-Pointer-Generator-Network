Kendall Jenner took the fashion world by storm this year - the reality star walked in numerous shows for the Spring/ Summer 15 shows in September.

But with the success has come heavy criticism from some parts of the industry that the 19 year old was handed her modelling career on a plate thanks to her famous family. 

The teen has been keen to defend herself against these accusations in recent weeks - last week she gave an interview arguing that her success hadn't just happened magically.

She said: ''I’m not trying to use a family name or anything. In reality I worked pretty hard for this… It wasn’t like I just got it magically and it just happened.' 

Now, a new article in Look magazine claims the star has formed a game plan to ensure she continues to bag high-profile contracts, like her new ad campaign for Estee Lauder. 

Kendall isn't the first celebrity to get modelling contracts thanks to her family ties - she comes from a long line of attractive showbiz offspring who have featured in catwalk shows and adverts. 

Jade, Lizzie and Georgia May Jagger have all walked the runway for various fashion houses, as has Elvis's granddaughter Riley Keogh and Keith Richards's daughters Theodora and Alexandra.

Even Pierce Brosnan's son Dylan recently featured in a campaign for Yves Saint Laurent. 

But Kendall is the most prolific of all of the models so far - she is also the only one to come from a reality television family as opposed to a Rock and Roll or acting dynasty. 

Arisce Wanzer is a model who is signed to BMG agency and has walked for shows like Topshop

American model Arisce Wanzer, who is signed to BMG agency, has walked for shows like Topshop and was hired as the face of Kenneth Cole, has hit back at Kendall's claims. 

In a open letter on The Blot website, she argues that normal girls have had to work much harder to gain even a fraction of Kendall's success and tries to explain the reason many normal models reacted the way they did to her sudden achievements in fashion.

Arisce Wanzer has a blog on The Blot website that documents her life as a model 

Arisce wrote: 'Dear Kendall,

'Take a moment and remove yourself from your current situation, if you can, to a life that isn’t riddled with excess.

'Now, imagine you’re from a small town and/or Third-World country where your only way to get out of your current social class, achieve your dreams, get a green card or just gain better work conditions is to become a high-fashion model. 

'You have to leave for six months to a year sometimes, signing contracts you can barely understand, let alone oblige to, almost without choice. 

'You’re away from your family, your friends and everything you know. You live in a one-bedroom apartment with six other girls in the same situation in  New York City.

'You have to go to tutoring and/or English lessons in between learning how to “walk” at the agency, attending castings every other day, going on test shoots to get you experience, trying to learn your new neighborhood, going to the gym and hoping to maybe make some money all at once.

'Oh, and your apartment and test shoots aren’t free, by the way. They are added to your account with the agency, as are your casting outfits and cellphone. 

'These are going to leave you in some serious debt if nobody books you for anything; some girls owe upward of $30,000 (£19,000) after a year of trying to book gigs.

'So now let’s pretend you actually lived through all of that, and it’s finally Fashion Week. Exciting, right? 

'This could be your big break! You could send your family in Belarus or Woodbridge, Va., the money they need for your little brothers to have new clothes or even afford a plane ticket home for the holidays!

'Imagine standing in line after line of girls with your exact height and body measurements all day, each one hoping for a coveted spot on the New York Fashion Week runway.

'Casting after casting, and you just can’t seem to get your place.

'But suddenly after a week full of the word “No,” killing yourself at the gym, exhausting yourself in classes, cutting your diet in half, not talking with your family and sleeping in a room with six equally exhausted girls, you get the call. 

'Your agent texts you with an 8 a.m. fitting at Marc Jacobs. 

'Oh my god, you’re going to walk for Marc Jacobs! This is a dream come true, someone finally said yes, and the prestige is beyond what you could have imagined! 

'So you pack your model bag, a bottled water, your walking shoes and agency-approved casting outfit. This could be your big break, assuming they don’t cut your look last minute, a common practice done to no-name girls, so fingers crossed!  

'It’s the morning of the show, and the subway is packed with lots of models, agents, buyers and fashion people in general, all exhausted, but ready to work.

'Backstage is a commotion circus of clothes, hair, makeup, yelling, Fashion TV interviews … it’s an Instagram overload! 

'All the big names are there, your personal heroes including Karlie Kloss, Joan Smalls,  Anna Wintour, Marc Jacobs himself — the list goes on!

'But wait, isn’t that a reality TV star over there in hair and makeup? 

'Yea, that’s definitely a Kardashian or something. What is she doing here? 

'Did she take the subway? Was she at the casting? What agency is she with? I didn’t see her last season … 

'Does she need MORE fame? MORE money? A green card perhaps?

'This girl didn’t do and doesn’t owe half of what you did to get here today, that much is certain.

'Her mommy surely called a top agency, got her in the door and the design houses just chose to milk her fame like the cash cow that it is.

'One by one like dominos from Vogue to Givenchy, fashion is selling out to the ignorant masses for money. 

'What happened to the art, the cerebral part of fashion? Did it really all die with Alexander McQueen? 

'Gone is the prestige you once felt as a “chosen one” by Marc, Anna or Ricardo — this cheapens your entire experience. 

'You thought you were special, that your hard work had finally paid off. You didn’t realize that these coveted spots were for sale. 

'The cost? The soul and dignity of a fashion house. 

'The clothes will still sell, and the players will still play, but the image will be forever tarnished by these real life Veruca Salts buying their way in with sleazy fame rights.'
