An daredevil on a paramotor who crashed and got stuck 30ft up a tree managed to capture to whole terrifying ordeal on his helmet-cam.

Scott Little, 24, had taken advantage of fine weather in Somerset to take to the skies on a paramotor - which looks like a giant fan strapped to his back.

But Mr Little, a plasterer from Yeovil, hadn't reckoned with a fierce gust of crosswind which sent him hurtling towards a copse of tall trees.

Stuck! Paramotorer Scott Little found himself entangled 32ft up a tree and had to be rescued by more than 40 emergency workers in a two-hour operation

Daredevil: Little, 24, seen just before his collision with a tree. He had been taking advantage of good weather conditions to go paramotoring, a sport similar to paragliding

Rescue: Little, from Yeovil, came into difficulty at Ham Hill in Somerset when strong crosswinds sent him hurtling towards a copse of trees

Mr Little, who only took up the hobby earlier this year, remembered his training and tried to gain speed. But he clipped the top of the trees and was smacked in the face by a branch.

Seconds later, he was entangled in the
foliage and was left dangling in the top of the tree before being 
spotted by a dog walker.

It took more than 40 emergency workers two hours to bring him down from the tree, at Ham Hill Country Park in Yeovil.

Remarkably, Mr Little managed to use his 
mobile phone to call his family during the rescue - but they thought he 
was joking and refused to believe him.

The ordeal was recorded on Mr Little's helmet-cam, which had been intended to capture the stunning 
views of the countryside.

Trapped: Little (circled left) ended up several feet beneath his paramotor equipment after clipping the top of the trees, causing a branch to strike him in the face and make his become tangled in the branches

Emergency rescue: Fire engines at the scene of the accident. His parachute is visible wrapped in branches in the copse of trees

Mr Little said: 'The initial reaction was,
'I'm going to hit the trees', but with the training your reaction is to
almost do the opposite so instead of slowing down you go fast.

'I was two feet away from missing them. It happened so quickly. I found it quite amusing.

'I couldn't get a mobile signal up the tree at first but once I did I phoned my family who were together at the time.

'I told them I was surrounded by firemen and ambulances and I was stuck up a tree.

'They all laughed and didn't believe 
me, and carried on with what they were doing. It wasn't until after 3pm 
they called and wondered where I was.'

Long way down! Little can be seen clinging on to the foliage as he tried to untangle his parachute which got stuck about 30ft up the tree

Exciting hobby: Little, a plasterer by trade, is used to spectacular views of the Westcountry landscape when he goes up with his paramotor

Busy: Two fire appliances, police and ambulances were involved in the emergency rescue operation

Paramotors work by the pilot running 
into the wind carrying a parachute and when it catches the motor 
strapped to their back carries them upwards.

Two fire appliances attended the scene along with a specialist rescue team, police and ambulance services.

Luckily, Mr Little escaped with just a black eye and some scratches from his first accident.

He added: 'Surprisingly none of the equipment is damaged apart from three props on the back of the engine.

'I feel lucky. It could have been worse however it's such good fun I can't wait to get back up there.

'So long as you are being sensible, flying in the right conditions and have had plenty of training then generally it's safe.'
