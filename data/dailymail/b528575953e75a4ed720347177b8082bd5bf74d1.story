Police officers in Moscow could be fired after a leaked video appeared to show them mocking a schizophrenic woman who had stripped naked and danced on a desk.

The clip prompted outrage in Russia after the woman, identified as Irina K, was arrested for allegedly shouting abuse at passers-by in the Russian capital's western district of Shchukino.

When she arrived at a police station, instead of restraining her, calming her down or fetching her clothes officers appeared to mock the woman while filming her on a phone.

Abuse: These images of a mentally ill woman dancing naked in a police station in Russia - where officers laughed and filmed her instead of coming to her aid - prompted outrage and have triggered an investigation

Russian media reports suggested the police officers involved were due to face disciplinary action.

According to the Russian newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets, the incident took place on January 11 after the woman, who suffers from schizophrenia, was discharged from hospital.

The newspaper said the woman was not properly monitored and drank to excess in her apartment before walking into the street outside.

There she allegedly jumped on passing cars and frightened passers-by with loud shrieks before she was arrested.

When she was taken to a police station, she was allowed to strip naked and jump on a table while an unnamed person - allegedly a police officer - filmed her on a mobile phone and laughed.

The video, believed to have been filmed in the police station's reception area, showed the woman singing incoherently and rubbing her body against a wall.

She then picked up her trousers, threw them down again and grabbed the bars of a cell, pulling at them violently.

The woman was eventually helped and taken for treatment at a psychiatric hospital, but the footage of her apparent mistreatment by police provoked horror when it was leaked online.

A police spokesman told Central European News: 'The behavior of the officers was completely unacceptable.

'The woman had been taken to the police station where a doctor and ambulance had been called to take her to a local psychiatric hospital.

'That the officers allowed her to strip off and then filmed her whilst laughing and mocking her is disgraceful.

'An investigation is now under way and the officer who shot the video as well as the senior officer on duty may well be fired.

'The other policemen seen in the video will be disciplined.'
