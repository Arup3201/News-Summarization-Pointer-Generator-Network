Tim Sherwood, Uwe Rosler and MK Dons manager Karl Robinson are among those in the frame to take over.

Bloom is understood to want a new manager in place before the FA Cup third round tie against Brentford on January 3.

Burke's dismissal suggests that the board see this season's problems to be about recruitment rather than coaching.

Speaking to www.seagulls.co.uk, Bloom underlined the reasons for Burke's departure saying: 'David's been with us for three years, and I would like to thank him for all his hard work and endeavour on behalf of the club during that time.

'There is no question he has done an exceptional job in helping with the design of the American Express Elite Football Performance Centre and in putting in place a first-class infrastructure in the football, academy and sports science areas of the club.

'David's work in helping to establish the club's first-ever academy and to quickly gain category one status in the new world of the EPPP guidelines is highly appreciated by myself and by everyone at the club.

'He's also helped to put in place our scouting department, and his work in all these areas will stand us in very good stead for the future.

'On behalf of the board I would like to thank David for these achievements and to wish him the very best for the future.'

Brighton & Hove Albion have confirmed they have accepted the resignation of first-team manager Sami Hyypia.

Chairman Tony Bloom said, 'Sami offered his resignation, and we reluctantly accepted earlier today (Monday).

'Sami has worked extremely hard since joining the club last summer. Despite some good performances, including most recently at Wolves, results haven't gone as well as we all had hoped and expected.

'Sami is an incredibly honourable man. He remains a hugely respected and very popular figure at our club. He has decided to step down for the benefit of the team and the club.

'We are all very disappointed, but we respect Sami’s decision and we all wish him well for the future.'

Nathan Jones, assistant manager, will take charge of the team for the Boxing Day fixture against Reading.

The club will offer no further comment at this stage.
