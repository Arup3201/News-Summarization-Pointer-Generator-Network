Ex-employees have slammed the safety practices of the tour company that conducted the bushwalk at a popular tourist destination in central Australia, which resulted in the death of a UK backpacker two weeks ago.

A 23-year-old British woman was killed when she fell 30 metres at Kings Canyon, 450km west of Alice Springs, while doing the rim walk with The Rock Tour.

It is believed she fell while posing for a photograph at the edge of the canyon, though the specific circumstances of the incident are unknown.

Former employees of The Rock Tour in central Australia have told MailOnline that the company has a reputation for being 'cowboys' and that 'it was only a matter of time' before a death like this happened.

Their criticism comes as photos have emerged of tour guides skylarking at the edges of Kings Canyon – posing close to the edge and standing on small ledges above 50 metre drops.

Adam Cooper, who was a tour guide with the company from March 2011 to April 2012 and returned in March 2014 for five weeks, said he left the company this year because of concerns about their safety practices.

He told MailOnline that at Kestrel Falls, the area of the walk where it is believed the woman died, walkers regularly pose on a thin ledge, only a metre wide, above a 50 metre drop.

'There's actually a bit up near the waterfall where... guides encourage people to take a photo off the ledge, it's so dangerous, if you fell that'd be falling 50 metres,' he said.

Three tourists pose on the ledge, above a large drop at Kestrel Falls in the rain. The photo was posted to The Rock Tour Facebook page on April 12 this year

Numerous photographs of The Rock Tour guides and walkers posing on the ledge or posing close to the edge of the canyon, even in the rain when the sandstone would be slippery, have been posted to the Facebook pages of The Rock Tour guides, and some have been posted to the company's Facebook page.

They have since been taken down by the company.

Managing director of The Rock Tour, Rob Cowan stated that photographs are uploaded to the company's Facebook page by employees and the page is regularly monitored by company management.

Whenever management sees a photograph depicting inappropriate behaviour they remove the picture and talk to the guide in question, he said.

'We have a three-strikes-you're-out policy,' he said and commented that two of the tour guides depicted in the photographs obtained by MailOnline had since been fired or encouraged to leave the company.

Adam Cooper added: 'I'm not surprised there's been a death on the tour. Rock Tour has a really bad reputation out there.'

He claimed that tour guides at the company were given limited training – shadowing another guide for only three tours before they are sent out on their own.

The itinerary guides follow is also unsafe, he said, with guides required to drive hundreds of kilometres each day and conduct physically demanding walks on five hours sleep each night.

The Rock Tour is based out of Alice Springs and has been operating tours in the area since 2007

Another former employee of The Rock Tour, who preferred not to be named, told MailOnline that the company 'operated like cowboys' and staff were 'encouraged to be party animals'.

He said when he worked for the company last year he had conversations with management about their safety practices but 'it was laughed off'.

'We would never laugh off any concerns about safety,' Rob Cowan told MailOnline.

'In eight years of operation we have taken over 3,200 tours to Uluru, that's in excess of 82,000 people and until June 15 we were yet to have a fatality,' he said.

He disputed the claim that his company is unsafe as the allegations of 'disgruntled ex-employees.'

Mr Cowan said that guides at the company received excellent training, completing four training trips, and receiving a Certificate III in tour guiding, their senior First Aid certificate and a light rigid vehicle license before they were sent out alone.

He also disputed Mr Cooper's claims about the safety of the itinerary.

'Nowhere during the itinerary is there a five-hour sleep. If there is a five-hour sleep it's because the guide's not doing the right thing,' he said.

On May 8, a Rock Tour bus tipped on its side while travelling on sand at Curtin Springs. 21 people were on board but no one was injured.

Police investigated the incident but said that there was no sign of negligence from the company.

The Rock Tour operate three-day tours from Alice Springs that take travellers to Kings Canyon, Uluru and Kata Tjuta.
