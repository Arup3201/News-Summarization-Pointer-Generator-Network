David Cameron’s daughter Florence was rushed to hospital last week after getting a sticker trapped up her nose.

Doctors at St Thomas’ in London removed the sticker after her concerned parents’ unsuccessful attempts to do so at their Downing Street flat.

They became aware of the two-year-old’s discomfort when she began spluttering at the breakfast table.

Unstuck: Florence Cameron was rushed to St Thomas' Hospital in London after getting a sticker trapped in her nose

Both David and Samantha Cameron tried and failed to extract the sticker and Florence was taken to St Thomas’, where it was surgically removed.

The domestic drama comes a year after the Camerons left Florence’s sister Nancy, nine, in a pub where they had gone for Sunday lunch near the Prime Minister’s retreat, Chequers.

Mr Cameron disclosed Florence’s mishap during a visit to London’s Evelina Children’s Hospital on Friday, to mark the 65th anniversary of the National Health Service. 

Accepting an Evelina sticker, he joked: ‘I have to be careful with stickers – my daughter Florence got one stuck up her nose only yesterday.’

Asked what had happened, he said: ‘The first Sam and I knew about it was at breakfast when it was obvious Florence was having some difficulty breathing. It turned out she had a sticker stuck up her nose. We both tried to get it out but we just couldn’t do it.’

Florence, who is three next month, 
was taken to St Thomas’ by the family’s long-serving Nepalese nanny, 
Gita Lama, 32, and treated within an hour, but Whitehall insiders stress
the tot did not get special treatment as the PM’s daughter.

‘She was treated very quickly,’ said one. ‘The doctors and nurses did a great job and the PM and his wife were delighted she came back safe and well. She has been told not to put stickers in her nose any more.’

During his trip to the Evelina Hospital, Mr Cameron told staff of the many visits he and Samantha made when their son Ivan was being treated there. He was six when he died in 2010.

Mr Cameron said: ‘I will never forget the care my son Ivan received and the inspirational people who helped Sam and me through some of the most difficult times.’
