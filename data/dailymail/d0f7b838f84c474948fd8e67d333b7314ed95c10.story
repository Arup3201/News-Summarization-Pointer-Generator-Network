One in four visits to A&E is made by a patient who cannot get an appointment with their GP, according to research.

The first study to estimate the scale of the problem has found that 5.8million visits a year are directly down to patients being unable to see their family doctor.

Last week, the number of patients arriving at casualty reached a record high of almost 300,000 – a 10 per cent rise on the same period three years ago.

Researchers found that 18 per cent of patients surveyed had been unable to get a convenient appointment and 1.67 per cent had resorted to going to A&E

Patients have been finding it increasingly difficult to get a GP appointment and waiting lists have soared with the rising population and longer life expectancy.

But the situation is made worse by the fact that many surgeries routinely shut their doors for up to four-and-a-half hours for lunch or for an entire afternoon during the week.

And it is almost impossible to see a GP out of hours because, since 2004, doctors have been allowed to subcontract the work to private firms who employ locums.

In the first study of its kind, researchers from Imperial College London, analysed the Department of Health's annual GP patient survey which covers one million people.

They found that 18 per cent had been unable to get a convenient appointment and 1.67 per cent had resorted to going to A&E.

If these findings are representative for the 345.6million patients who try and see their GP every year, it means 5.77million are ending up in casualty because they cannot get an appointment. This is just over a quarter of the total 21.7million A&E attendances a year.

Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt has been warned plans to name and shame doctors over cancer delays 'could backfire'

Last night Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern, said: 'The crowds at A&E just rise and rise because people can't get an appointment. You have to wait hours in A&E, it's not an easy option. People are just upset and worried, it's hopeless.

'GPs used to be open much longer and 
if they weren't at the surgeries at least you could get hold of them. I 
remember doctors ringing me out of hours and talking me through my 
problem. Now you just get a recorded message … and that's the end of it.
 We need more doctors. It's getting very serious.'

Thomas
 Cowling, a researcher at the School of Public Health at Imperial 
College London, said: 'There has been a lot of talk in recent years 
about rising numbers of A&E attendances and the impact that this 
might be having on A&E departments.

'It
 has been suggested that a lack of access to GPs could be a factor but 
there hasn't been much evidence … The aim of this analysis was to inform
 the debate – until now, the numerical scale of the problem hadn't been 
estimated.'

The study, published in the British Journal of General Practice, did not break down whether patients had tried in vain to see their GP during the normal working week or out of hours.

But an investigation by the Mail this month found that more than a quarter of surgeries close for at least one afternoon during the week with some shutting for four-and-a-half hours at lunch. A few offer evening and weekend appointments but most put patients through to private, out-of-hours firms who provide a patchy service staffed mainly by locums.

Last week there were 299,031 A&E attendances, the highest since records began in 2010 and a rise of 5 per cent compared to the same period last year.

But GPs also say they cannot cope with the demands of the rising, ageing population on top of a recruitment crisis. Some under-pressure surgeries have had to strike patients off arbitrarily including one in Watton, Norfolk, which removed a 95-year-old widow from its books.

Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said: 'There are not enough GPs and other staff available to treat the sheer number of people coming through the surgery door. This is not a problem that is going away, we need urgent action.'

Dr Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said that 'a significant number of patients could be seen elsewhere if that capacity existed'.

He added that the College's own research had estimated that just two million patients went to A&E after failing to see their GP – fewer than the Imperial College study. Yesterday Tory MPs urged David Cameron to increase the NHS budget in the face of unprecedented demand from patients.

Dr Sarah Wollaston, a qualified GP, and former health secretary Stephen Dorrell wrote to the Prime Minister warning him the system could 'collapse' within five years.

NHS England's director of operations, Dr Sarah Pinto-Duschinsky, said: 'Emergency admissions to hospital remain high and NHS England is redoubling efforts to ensure patients have speedy access to care, and address performance issues quickly.'
