Jailed: Cheating mother-of-two Lynne Keeling swindled £41,000 in incapacity benefit

A lying mother who swindled £41,000 in benefits claiming she needed to wear a neck brace at all times and use a walking stick  was caught lifting a heavy suitcase into a car and working as a teaching assistant.

Cheating Lynne Keeling, 51, said it took her between three and five minutes to walk just 20 to 30 metres and that she needed help going to the toilet and was prone to falling over.

But undercover investigators discovered she worked 25 hours a week as a teaching assistant at a primary school and that part of her job included pushing disabled pupils around in their wheelchairs.

Keeling had initially been entitled to incapacity benefits but she failed to inform 
the authorities when her health improved and continued to pocket the state 
hand-outs.

Over a seven year period between November 8, 2006 and July 13, 2013 she fradulently claimed £41,789.85 in incapacity benefits.

Keeling was jailed for 27 weeks at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday after 
pleading guilty to dishonestly failing to notify a change of 
circumstances in relation to her claims for disability living allowance.

Judge
 Paul Glenn said: 'This offending is serious. Benefit fraud is very 
prevalent. It is very easy to commit and very difficult to detect.

'The 
victims are hard-working taxpayers and those involved in worthy causes 
who can’t obtain public funding because people like you limit the amount
 of funds available.

'Just
 three months after you made the claim you were working five days a week
 in a school and you stayed there for over six years.

'Your
 duties at the school were such you could not possibly have performed 
them if you were anything like as incapacitated as you purported to be.

'You perpetuated this fraud for close on seven years, a very significant period.'

The court heard Keeling worked 25-hours-a-week at Maple Court Primary School, in Bentilee, Staffs., from November 8, 2006.

After being made redundant on December 31, 2012 the married mum began attending Stoke-on-Trent College.

Caught out: Benefits cheat Lynne Keeling is pictured lifting a heavy suitcase into her car despite claiming she needed to wear a neck brace at all times and could barely walk

It
 was there where investigators filmed Keeling getting out of her 
mobility car and walking without any difficulty on March 6 and March 27,
 2013.

Prosecutor
 Joanne Wallbanks said: 'She seemed to be walking perfectly well with no
 neck brace or sticks. She lifts a case out the boot and carries it with
 ease.'

The mother-of-two, from Bentilee, was interviewed on July 5, 2013 and claimed she was in constant pain.

The
 court heard she has since appealed and has been allowed a ‘lower rate’ 
of benefits, although the matter has not been fully resolved.

Stuart Muldoon, defending, said: 'Mrs Keeling has had difficulties with her health over the years.'

Speaking after the sentencing, Sian Fellowes, DWP Fraud Manager in the West Midlands, said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system.

'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of.

'It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net.

'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime.'
