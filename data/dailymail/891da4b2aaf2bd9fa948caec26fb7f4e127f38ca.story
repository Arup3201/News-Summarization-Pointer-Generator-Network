A Norwegian cruise ship was stuck in the Hudson River for hours Sunday morning and had to be dragged to Pier 88 on Manhattan's West Side by a tugboat.

The coast guard said a problem with the ship's steering and propulsion system caused the delay of the Norwegian Breakaway, which had just arrived from a weeklong Caribbean cruise.

Coast Guard officials said the ship became stuck about 7:45a.m., and Captain of the Port Gordon Loebl ordered the tugboat to to haul it in.

The ship finally docked at Pier 88, at West 48th St., at around 10 a.m.

Spokesman Frank Iannazzo Simmons said the vessel was supposed to dock at 7a.m.

'They pulled in and tied the vessel up to the pier,' said Iannazzo-Simmons told the New York Daily News.

Passenger Frank Fasulo said tempers flared as hundreds of people waited in line for hours to disembark.

'It got a little hostile because people are coming the elevators and trying to cut the line,' he said.

'Meanwhile, it's already 200 deep, so they had to get some security guards to close down the elevators and direct the people where they were going.'

Ashley Hernandez, 30, told the Daily News.

'It got a little chaotic. It was really unorganized. There were people fighting when we got off the ship.'

One man, Roy, was waiting anxiously at the dock after he received word that his father had a heart attack aboard the ship.

'It's been nothing but problems,' he said.

Other passengers said the crew handled the situation well.

Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman AnneMarie Mathews described the glitch as a minor incident.

'The ship was slightly delayed because of strong currents in the Hudson River,' she said. 'We thank our guests for their patience and understanding.'

She said a scheduled cruise to Bermuda on the Norwegian Breakaway would depart this afternoon at 5 p.m.

It was not clear how many passengers were aboard. According to the company website, the 1,063-foot Breakaway holds more than 4,000 guests.
