Despite her fears Sun's husband Cui Lianhua approved of her new past time although he was slightly worried she could aggravate a back injury

'The dance moves that are done beside the pole are very elegant, especially when a woman dances these moves.

'It's very feminine, enchanting and seductive. It's full of youthful vigor and sexiness.'

Because pole dancing is associated with strip clubs in China, Fengqin kept her desire to learn a secret from her family, but word soon got around, and her family discovered her hidden talents.

But to Sun's relief they all approved, even her husband Cui Lianhua, although he was concerned because of a previous back injury she had.

Her instructor, Shen Ting, said she was a little shocked to be teaching a woman old enough to be her grandmother how to spin around a pole, but was happy to have her as a student.

She said: 'After all, pole dancing is a kind of exercise so now, for a 60-year-old like her to be accepting of this and to be able to dance so well, [it shows] anyone can learn pole dancing.'
