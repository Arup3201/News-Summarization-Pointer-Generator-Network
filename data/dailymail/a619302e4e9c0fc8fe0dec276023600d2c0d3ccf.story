Paedophile: Karl Curtis, aka Robert Oliver, breached an order banning him from having children in his home

One of Britain's most notorious paedophiles was jailed again today for inviting children into his home.

Robert Oliver, 58, was part of a gang led by Sidney Cooke which raped and killed a teenage boy in 1985.

He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his part in the killing of 14-year-old Jason Swift but was released in 1997 after serving just eight years.

Oliver, who has changed his name to Karl Curtis, was arrested again last month for breaching a court order banning him from letting children into his home.

Families living on the same street in Maidstone, Kent, had unwittingly befriended the paedophile and let their children visit the bungalow he shared with his male partner.

But one father became suspicious and after searching online he discovered Oliver's history.

Kent Police were called and he was arrested on June 7 for breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order imposed two years ago.

He pleaded guilty to two breaches of the order on June 12 and was remanded in custody at HMP Elmley on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent.

He admitted a further two charges when he appeared before Maidstone Crown Court today where he was jailed for three years by Judge Michael Carroll.

Release: Oliver, pictured leaving prison in 1997, previously served eight years of a 15-year sentence for his part in the rape and murder of Uason Swift, 14

Two of the offences were committed on June 4, one on June 6 and another on May 15 this year.

On
 one occasion Oliver gave a birthday card to a child, while another time
 he allowed a boy whose mother was visiting him to use the toilet in his
 bungalow.

The offences on June 4 related to two children knocking on his door as their mother was inside his home having a cup of tea.

Detective Constable Victoria Rixon, from Kent Police, said: 'Karl Curtis has a long offending history and is therefore a registered sex offender, and is also subject to a sex offender prevention order.

'We rigorously enforce these orders and within 24 hours of receiving information suggesting Curtis had breached his order he was arrested and has remained in prison ever since.

'He will now serve three years in prison, and when he is released will face the same close monitoring.'

Oliver was part of a gang called the Dirty Dozen who drugged and raped boys at orgies in the 1980s.

They are feared to have taken the lives of up to 25 youngsters.

Oliver is thought to have been living in Kent for more than five years after being driven out of former home in Somerset by an angry crowd.
