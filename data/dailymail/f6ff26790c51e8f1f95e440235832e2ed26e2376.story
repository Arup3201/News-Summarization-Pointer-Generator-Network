Paris Saint-Germain's stuttering form continued as the defending champions were held to a goalless draw at home to Montpellier amid booing at the final whistle at the Parc des Princes. 

The result moves PSG level on points with league leaders Marseille who lead their rivals on goal difference and host Lille on Sunday, while Montpellier remain in ninth place in the standings. 

Both sides struggled to carve out chances while the only shot on target in an abject first half was Zlatan Ibrahimovic's weak free kick with Montpellier having a goal ruled out for a tight offside decision.

PSG were looking to bounce back from their defeat at Guingamp and be in with a chance of ending 2014 as they had started; on top of the league standings.  

Montpellier, however, went closest to taking the lead when a stunning effort from Morgan Sanson was ruled offside.

PSG were jeered off the pitch at half-time, with their closest effort in the first half being Ibrahimovic's free kick which was comfortably gathered by Montpellier goalkeeper Jonathan Ligali.

The champions increased the pressure after the break with Thiago Silva almost turning in a corner but Mounier cleared his effort off the line with Ligali beaten.

Edinson Cavani was proving ineffective and was substituted in the 65th to a chorus of boos.

PSG appealed for a penalty four minutes from time but their appeal was waved away by referee Sebastien Moreira. 

The result was also the first time since 2012 that PSG had failed to score in two successive matches.
