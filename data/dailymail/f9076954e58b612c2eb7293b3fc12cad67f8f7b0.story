Former Dragons' Den panellist Doug Richard, who as acted as an adviser to David Cameron has been arrested on suspicion of raping an underage girl

An adviser to David Cameron has been arrested on suspicion of raping an underage girl.

Technology entrepreneur Doug Richard, who appeared in the first two series of the BBC show Dragons’ Den, was questioned by police earlier this month and released on bail until March.

The 56-year-old multi-millionaire denies the allegations. 

The US-born businessman has worked closely with Mr Cameron over several years. 

In 2011 he went on an official Government trip to Africa and also worked as an adviser to Chancellor George Osborne. 

In a statement to the Sunday Mirror, the married father-of-three said: ‘I absolutely deny the allegations made about me. It would be inappropriate to comment further.’

It was reported last night that the girl is 13.

A City of London Police spokesman said: ‘Detectives arrested a 56-year-old man on January 5, 2015, on suspicion of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, sexual activity with a child, meeting a child following sexual grooming and rape of a girl under the age of consent.’

Richard made his fortune in the 1990s, buying and selling software firms in his native California, before moving to Britain in 2001. 

Richard was one of the original Dragons, but left the BBC show in 2005 after failing to make any investments in the second series. He remains the only Dragon not to invest throughout a series.

Later he said he needed  to attend to his businesses, with filming for the BBC show taking up too much time. 

In 2008 he served was chairman of the Tories' Small Business Task Force, advising George Osborne and David Cameron.   

He then founded School for Start Ups which describes itself as creating 'education programs events and online support for budding entrepreneurs', and works in partnership with leading UK Universities, the Royal Institution and the British Library.

The businessman appeared in two series of the BBC show Dragons' Den before launching a company to help start-ups

The company has made visits to business schools and universities across the country, and offers loans of up to £25,000 to would-be aspiring entrepreneurs.  

In a recent interview with the Guardian, the Californian spoke of how British people were 'polite to a fault', and criticised programmes such as The Apprentice as creating a false image of the business world. 

'Unfortunately, I think it [the Apprentice] represents all the worst in business. It’s not the way I run my company. It’s not the way I treat my staff. 

'It’s not the way I expect an entrepreneur to act,' he told the newspaper. 

In 2006, married father Richard received an honorary Queen's Award for Enterprise Promotion for his work in promoting, developing and helping fellow entrepreneurs.

He was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Business from Plymouth University in 2013 and in November it was announced that he was to be the next chancellor of Teeside University - a role he was due to start early this year. 

Announcing his appointment, outgoing chancellor Lord Sawyer of Darlington said: 'I am sure that Doug Richard will be an outstanding chancellor.

'He is influential and well known as an active business leader and successful entrepreneur.'

A Downing Street spokesman declined to comment.
