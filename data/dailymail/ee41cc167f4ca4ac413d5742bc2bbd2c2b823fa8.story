If this turtle looks a little sorry for itself it has good reason - after suffering horrific injuries in a suspected collision with a boat.

Luckily the 100kg creature is now making a good recovery after vets at the Animal Ark Hospital in Darwin, Australia, inserted huge stitches to clamp its deep wounds together.

The turtle has been in intensive care after it was found on a beach with the terrible injuries to its shell and head.
