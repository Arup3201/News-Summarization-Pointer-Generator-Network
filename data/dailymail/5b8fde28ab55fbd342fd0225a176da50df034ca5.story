The mother of a Fort Bragg soldier who disappeared more than two years ago said police were led to her daughter's grave by the suspect charged in her killing.

Johnna Henson of St Cloud, Florida, said today she was told by Fayetteville police that Nicholas Holbert led authorities to the remains of her daughter Pfc. Kelli Bordeaux.

Holbert, 27, was charged with killing Bordeaux. Police say Holbert went with Bordeaux to the Fayetteville bar where she was last seen in April 2012.

He was charged with first-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping on Thursday afternoon. Prosecutors will review evidence to see if the charges
 warrant the death penalty.

Ms Henson says Holbert led investigators to Bordeaux's shallow grave in a densely-wooded area about four miles from the bar.

Detectives
 went on Wednesday to an area near the Interstate 295 corridor on the 
northern side of Fayetteville after receiving the information. The 
search turned up remains believed to be those ofÂ  Bordeaux.

Kelli Bordeaux's mother said today that her daughter's alleged killer led police to her body in dense woodland

The remains will be sent to the chief medical examiner's office to confirm the identity.

Fayetteville Police Chief Harold Medlock said that Holbert had been a person of interest in the case since Bordeaux disappeared.

Bordeaux was 23 when she was last seen on the early morning of April 14, 2012, at Froggy Bottoms bar in Fayetteville, where she had gone to sing karaoke.

At the time, police believed she left the bar with a man she met there the week before, a person identified as a registered sex offender. She was reported missing two days later when she didn't report to work.

Arrest warrants obtained on Wednesday by The Fayetteville Observer
 say that Holbert and Bordeaux arrived together at the now-closed bar 
and were there for several hours before getting into a fight in the 
parking lot.

Holbert allegedly knocked the 23-year-old woman unconscious, and then brought her to his home behind the bar.

He then beat her around the head until she died, according to warrants.

Pfc. Bordeaux was reported missing when she didn't report for duty at Fort Bragg where she served in a medical unit. Remains found by the interstate close to Fayetteville, North Carolina are being sent to the medical examiner to confirm it is the young soldier

Convicted sex offender Nicholas Holbert said he drove Bordeaux home but denies any further involvement. He was arrested on Wednesday and will be charged with first-degree murder, police said

The man, who Lt. Joyce identified as 
Holbert, said he dropped off Bordeaux at the entrance to the apartment 
complex where she lived with her husband Mike, who was in Florida visiting 
family that weekend.

Holbert
 was jailed because he did not live at the address he gave authorities, 
as a registered sex offender is required to do, but he said at the time 
he had nothing to do with her disappearance.

According to The Fayetteville Observer, police learned two text messages were sent from Bordeaux's phone after she left the bar, including one that said she had arrived home.

Police said early in the investigation that they didn't believe Bordeaux sent that one.

Volunteers gathered repeatedly in the weeks and months following Bordeaux's disappearance to conduct searches.

Fort Bragg and Fayetteville officials had offered a $25,000 reward for information regarding her whereabouts.

It was nearly a year ago this month that the U.S. Army declared Bordeaux dead. That move allowed her family to receive military death benefits.

Bordeaux, a Florida native, was assigned to the 601st Area Support Medical Company, 44th Medical Brigade and served as a combat medic.

'She and her family have remained close in our hearts since Kelli last stood in our formation in April 2012,' said Lt. Col. Heather A. Kness, commander of the 261st Multifunctional Medical Battalion in which Bordeaux's served.

'We honor her memory and will always remember her vibrant spirit, her love of life and her loyal and dedicated service to our Army and nation as a combat medic.'
