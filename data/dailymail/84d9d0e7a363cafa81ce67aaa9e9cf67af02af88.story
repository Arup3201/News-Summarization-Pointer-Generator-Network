David Anderson said the Prime Minister’s plan to stop jihadis returning to the UK had ended up being ‘nothing like as dramatic’ as claimed

David Cameron announced policies without first working out how to implement them, the chief reviewer of terror laws claimed yesterday.

In a stinging rebuke, David Anderson said the Prime Minister’s plan to stop jihadis returning to the UK had ended up being ‘nothing like as dramatic’ as claimed.

The QC argued that the exclusion orders – announced amid great fanfare in September – should really be called powers of ‘managed or controlled return’.

In most cases, fanatics will simply be required to agree to a curfew, regularly visit a police station or attend a de-radicalisation course.

Mr Anderson’s comments came as the Government unveiled its much-trailed Counter Terrorism and Security Bill.

Documents released alongside the legislation show officials expect to seize 50 passports from suspected jihadis intending to travel to Syria or terrorist training camps every year.

The Home Office also predicts that 15 fanatics will be placed under T-PIM terrorism prevention measures, under which they can be put into internal exile and forced to live 200 miles away from their associates.

The Bill also contains:

Two months ago, after the threat of a terrorist attack was raised from substantial to severe, Mr Cameron pledged new laws to bar jihadis from returning from Syria.

But the plan was quickly savaged by MPs and legal experts for being unlawful since it would effectively leave British citizens stateless.

In the final version, it has been downgraded to a system of exclusion orders, lasting a maximum of two years.

Crucially, a fanatic will be denied entry only if they refuse to be monitored upon their return or face prosecution.

Mr Anderson, who was appointed by the Home Office to scrutinise all counter-terrorism legislation, said of the Prime Minister’s original plan: ‘I sense that this was an announcement waiting for a policy.’

He told a committee of MPs and peers he believed it had soon become clear that such a move would ‘neither legally nor practically’ work and the plan was now for a system of ‘managed return’.

Mr Anderson added: ‘My impression is also that, frankly, the policies announced on September 1, some of them were well thought through and well worked out and well prepared, others not so much.

‘What we now have is a power that although entitled exclusion orders, or temporary exclusion orders, I think in reality it is much closer to managed return or controlled return.’

Amnesty International called the powers ‘draconian’, adding that none of the measures seemed well grounded.
