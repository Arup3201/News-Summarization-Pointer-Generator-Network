Two turkeys spared a certain death last year by President Obama who pardoned them in an annual ceremonious event are dead.

Cobbler and Gobbler, two 40-pound birds from Rockingham Country, Virginia, were sent off to live a charmed life on the sprawling historic estate of George Washington.

Sparing turkeys is a tradition that dates back to 1963, when President John F Kennedy sent that year’s gift from the National Turkey Federation back to the farm, declaring ‘we’ll just let this one grow’.

President George H.W. Bush was the first to grant a turkey an official presidential pardon in 1989, according to ABC News.

At last year’s ceremony, Obama said: ‘From here these two lucky birds will be swept up in a whirlwind of fame and fortune that will ultimately lead them to Mount Vernon, where they will spend their twilight years in the storied home of George Washington.’

But their freedom was short lived.

Cobbler, who, according to the White House, loved cranberries and the musical stylings of Carly Simon, was reportedly euthanized in August.

The official beginning: President George H.W. Bush was the first to grant a turkey an official presidential pardon in 1989

Obituary: Cobbler loved cranberries and singer Carly Simon, while Gobbler, who dropped dead in February, was a 'patient but proud bird'. Both were spared by President Obama last year

And Gobbler, described as ‘a patient but proud bird’, passed away suddenly of unknown causes in February.

All of the eight turkeys pardoned by Obama have reportedly moved on to greener pastures.

But that’s not necessarily the president’s fault.

The average turkey lifespan is roughly three to four years and Obama is not the first with a poor track record in this department. George W Bush’s chosen birds also died in 2001.

Greener pastures: The two birds were sent to live out their retirement at George Washington's Mount Vernon sprawling estate, but they didn't last long

A farmer at the time told the ABC that the birds are bred for eating and not retirement.

‘Their flesh has grown so fast, and their heart and their bones and their other organs can’t catch up.’

President Obama will continue the tradition on Wednesday, when he will grant two more turkeys their freedom.

Only time will tell if they will manage to enjoy their freedom more than their predecessors.
