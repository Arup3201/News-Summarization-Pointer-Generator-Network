The daughter of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the pilot of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, has fled Australia and returned home, as speculation grows of her father's possible involvement in the plane's mysterious disappearance.

It has been revealed Aishah Zaharie, the missing captain's daughter, lives in Melbourne and has a graduate degree in architecture from Geelong's Deakin University.

But Aishah has since returned to her family home in an upmarket Kuala Lumpur suburb, which is just 15 miles from the airport.

The 27-year-old and her boyfriend Hazwan Anuar studied together at the International Islamic University of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur before moving to Melbourne, The Courier-Mail reports.

Tim Jones from Wandin Valley Farms, east of Melbourne, told The Age he believes the couple worked on the property picking fruit several years ago.

Deakin University released a statement on Monday confirming Aishah studied there.

'A Deakin student by that name graduated as a master of architecture in 2012 with an exemplary record from this university,' the statement reads.

Aishah's Facebook page prominently features a graduation photo with her friends, a picture of her smiling with Anuar at a formal dinner, and lists her home town as Shah Alam, Malaysia.

A Twitter account bearing her name, @shazzary, has been disabled.

It comes as more details emerge on her missing pilot father, revealing a man who's a keen chef, prankster, oddball inventor and obsessed with flying.

Malaysian police have confiscated Zaharie's home-built flight simulator as investigations into his possible involvement in the MH370 incident intensify.

Pictures of Zaharie and his family, including daughter Aishah, show a happy man who liked spending his spare time in the kitchen, fishing and being with his loved ones.

And the family has moved to defend Captain Zaharie in a YouTube tribute, dedicated to showing a man 'well-loved by many'.

The clip portrays the pilot as a 'loving, reflective, generous, cool, sporting, intelligent, supportive...' man.

The family then pleads: 'Come home, we miss you'.

One key focus of the investigation into Captain Zaharie and his co-pilot, Fariq Ab Hamid, is the make-shift home flight simulator built by Zaharie to mirror the set-up of the Boeing 777-200 he was flying with MH370.

US aviation expert John Nance has told ABC News that the simulator, which features three wide-screen monitors and an overheard panel, will be inspected to see if it may have helped plot the disappearance of MH370.

'Any indication that the simulator could practice anything untoward like practicing landing on small islands in the ocean,' Mr Nance said.

Captain Zaharie boasted about his simulator on an internet forum in November, 2012.

'Elo guys, zaharie here,' says the post.

'Awesome view on 3 panasonic 32 in. LCD HDMI and and 3 touchscreen Dell 21 inches for main (MCP) , center pedestal, overhead panel.

'Time to take to the next level of simulation.Motion! looking for buddies to share this passion. Capt Zaharie Ahmad Shah, BOEING 777 MALAYSIA AIRLINES.'
