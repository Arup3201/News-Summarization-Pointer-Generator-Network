Police in 
Rio de Janeiro have declared Ray Whelan, the English director of FIFA's 
ticket and hospitality partners MATCH, to be 'a fugitive' after they 
attempted to re-arrest him as part of an investigation into ticket 
touting.

Officers
 arrived at the Copacabana Palace hotel with an arrest warrant, but 
Whelan was not there and police said they had CCTV footage of him 
leaving through a service door.

MATCH has stuck by Whelan and insisted he has played no part in any wrongdoing.

'Fugitive':
 Ray Whelan, the director of MATCH services, is said to have fled 
through the service entrance of the lavish Copacabana Palace an hour 
before Brazilian police were set to re-arrest him

Rio police investigator Fabio Barucke told reporters outside the hotel: 'He's now considered a fugitive. We have security camera images of him exiting the hotel through a service door.'

The Copacabana Palace is also the hotel where all the senior FIFA executives are staying, and the latest police involvement is another embarrassment for the world governing body.

Jaime Byrom, executive chairman of MATCH, and Whelan's brother-in-law, said in a statement released earlier on Thursday: 'Notwithstanding our belief that the action taken against Mr Whelan was illegal and baseless, MATCH Services and I personally remain totally committed to assist the authorities from the 18th Precinct [police] or any other jurisdiction in FIFA's fight against illegal ticket sales.'

 of probe: Brazilian police have described Whelan, pictured being taken 
for questioning on Monday, as the 'facilitator' of the scandal which saw
 tickets being sold for vastly-inflated prices

Police first arrested Whelan, a former 
agent to Sir Bobby Charlton, earlier this week and seized 83 hospitality
 packages and tickets, a laptop, two mobile phones and 1,300 US dollars.
 He was released on bail after spending a night in custody.

MATCH 
said police recordings of mobile phone conversations between Whelan and 
an Algerian, Lamine Fofana, who police allege was the leader of the 
ticket-touting ring, only showed Whelan legitimately negotiating the 
sale of hospitality packages to Fofana.

MATCH admitted that offering 
the packages for cash was 'highly unusual', but said it was 'permitted 
under the various terms and conditions'.

The company also said Whelan was unaware that MATCH had put a block on Fofana buying any more packages or tickets.

Barucke said they had recorded 900 calls between Whelan and Fofana since the World Cup began.
