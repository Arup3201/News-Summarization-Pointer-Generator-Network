Daniel Colman won the second-highest prize in poker history last night, but his face gave no clue.

The 23-year-old poker sensation took home $15.3million when he beat out card-playing veteran Daniel Negreanu at the final table of the Big One for One Drop tournament in Las Vegas on Tuesday.

But after the final card secured his win, he kept his poker face on and refused to even grant interviews.

Unimpressed: Colman's $15.3million prize is the second-highest in poker history, but he didn't want to talk about it with reporters after the event

Colman, from Boston, Massachusetts, beat out 41 other players in the tournament to benefit the One Drop Foundation but he had to be persuaded to even pose with his cash prize and bracelet.

Five minutes after the victory, he left the Rio Las Vegas hotel with a handler telling a Las Vegas Sun reporter he had 'no interest in promoting poker'.

Colman's behavior was quite a contrast to that of his competitor, Negreanu, who stayed on the stage for 30 minutes after the event to talk to reporters.

He holds no ill-opinion of Colman for his behavior after the win though.

'I respect it completely,' Negreanu said of Colman. 'To each his own. If it’s not something he wants to do then I think we should all give him a break.'

Colman's opponent Daniel Negreanu was much more livelier during the event, before Colman won

Negreanu certainly wasn't grieving the loss too much, since placing second in the tournament earned him  $8.3million - making him the new all-time winningest  player with a $29.8million poker fortune.

Colman's behavior should be understood considering the difference between professional poker players and athletes when it comes to TV.

While athletes have TV contracts included in their pay, poker players do not and have to front their own entrance into tournaments -  therefore getting nothing from a network like ESPN televising their game or interview.

It is also rumored that Colman may have only invested 10 per cent of his $1million entry into the tournament, meaning his actual winnings from Tuesday are just $1.53million.
