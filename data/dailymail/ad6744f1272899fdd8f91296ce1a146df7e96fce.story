At least 14 people were killed after a fuel truck exploded today in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, causing an industrial building to collapse and injuring dozens more.

The death toll could yet rise as rescue crews picked through charred vehicles and rubble near the Saudi National Guard building in an industrial area in the city's eastern district.

A security official, who refused to be named, said that at least 14 people were killed and 60 were injured.
