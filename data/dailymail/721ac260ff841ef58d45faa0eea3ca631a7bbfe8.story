British expat businessman Neil Heywood, whose murder has caused political upheaval in China, left his wife and children in a financial situation so uncertain that a former business associate paid for their plane tickets to attend his London funeral.

Mr Heywood left his family savings equivalent to a ‘five digit’ sum in British pounds, a family friend has revealed.

Police suspect he was the victim of a poisoning engineered by the wife of ousted Chongqing Communist Party boss Bo Xilai, over a business dispute that turned personal.

Suspicions: Police believe Gu Kailai, left, had businessman Neil 
Heywood, right, poisoned after he threatened to expose her plan to move 
millions of dollars abroad

They suspect that the 41-year-old Briton had been helping Bo’s wife Gu Kailai, a former high-powered lawyer, move money offshore in return for a commission on the transaction.

However the lack of funds left to his family raise the possibility that any financial dealings with Gu may not have yielded him windfall profits.

The account marks the first time that details of Heywood's financial affairs have emerged since he died in southwest China last November. Family friends also revealed more details about the final few days leading up to his death.

If such transactions did take place, and he made personal gains from it, Heywood's widow, known to friends as Lulu but who kept her maiden name Wang, has no knowledge of them, according to the friend's account.

Questions remain: It is thought that Mr Heywood was killed in one of the mountain-top hotel's £600-a-night villas, but details of his demise are sketchy

Wang, a native of China's northeastern city of Dalian where Bo was mayor from 1993 to 2000, and Heywood's mother, Ann, and sister in London have turned down interview requests.

‘She doesn't have a lot of bank savings,’ the source said, requesting anonymity, adding that she had to make monthly mortgage repayments on a three-storey town house the family owns in suburban Beijing.

When Heywood bought the house a few years ago, similar homes in the gated compound sold for around 3 million yuan ($476,900), according to a local broker. Today such houses sell for about 7 million yuan following a boom in Beijing real estate.

Police believe Gu plotted to murder Heywood after he demanded a larger-than-usual cut of a big transaction and threatened to expose her financial dealings if she refused, sources with knowledge of the investigation said.

Private: Mr Heywood's body was found at the three-star resort - the same hotel where Mr Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, the prime suspect in his murder is said to have shown her power by getting the local police chief to subdue rowdy diners

The scandal, which has brought down Bo, once considered a contender for a top national leadership post, is potentially the most divisive the Communist Party has faced in more than two decades.

It was not clear whether Heywood had other bank accounts his wife did not know about or owned assets overseas. If he did, his widow knew nothing of them, the family friend said.

Heywood, educated at England's elite Harrow School and a fluent Chinese speaker, dressed well, drove a Jaguar and had friends in Britain's aristocratic circles. He once arranged a visit to China by Winston Churchill's granddaughter.

One of Heywood's ancestors was Britain's consul general in the northern port city of Tianjin from 1929 to 1935.

His children went to an international school in Beijing where the family paid attendance fees totalling more than $50,000 a year.

But friends say his expatriate life, while comfortable, was not lavish. The chain-smoking Heywood made his living as a mostly self-employed consultant to companies, including the Beijing dealer of Aston Martin, helping them resolve disputes and assisting with due diligence.

His grey Jaguar was second-hand, with a license plate ‘N007W3’. He requested and obtained the ‘007’ plate from Beijing traffic authorities as he was a fan of James Bond spy movies and classic sports cars, according to the family friend.

Family friends dismissed UK media reports that Heywood may have been a British spy. The reports were based on the part-time work Heywood had done for Hakluyt, a UK-based private business consultancy founded by former British intelligence officers.

Another source close to the family scoffed at the idea, saying a real spy would hardly advertise the fact by driving around in a car with ‘007’ plates.

‘Who would be so stupid as to carve 007 on his face if he were a real spy?’ this second source said.

In 2006, Heywood advised the maker of London taxi cabs, which was looking to enter the Chinese market.

‘From a company viewpoint, he was rock solid - good knowledge, very intelligent, a well-organised sort of guy,’ said John Russell, chief executive of cab maker Manganese Bronze, which is 20 per cent owned by Chinese car maker Geely Automobile Holdings.

Heywood's widow flew to London with the couple's children - aged 7 and 11 - last December to attend a memorial service after the Aston Martin dealer in Beijing paid for their plane tickets, the family friend said.

Aston Martin Beijing declined to comment when reached by telephone.

The 41-year-old widow returned to Beijing with her children after the church service. They did not suspect then that Heywood had been murdered.

In his last days, Heywood did not appear stressed, family friends said. He attended the launch of a sports car club in Beijing on November 11 and bought his daughter a birthday gift, something from Apple, the next day.
