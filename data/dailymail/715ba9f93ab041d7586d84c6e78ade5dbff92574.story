Castle Grant is on the outskirts of Grantown-on-Spey, approximately 155.3 miles from Glasgow and 140 miles from Edinburgh. 

A Highland castle repossessed from disgraced former Rangers owner Craig Whyte has been sold to a mystery foreign buyer.

Castle Grant, on the outskirts of Grantown-on-Spey, was put up for sale at £1.1million in April after the Bank of Scotland seized the property from the businessman

The 15th-century castle was eventually purchased for £1m and is now set for ‘significant investment’ from its new owners, estate agents Strutt and Parker revealed.

Kevin Maley, partner at Strutt and Parker’s Inverness office, said ‘Castle Grant was launched to the market in the spring and generated a significant amount of interest from buyers across the globe, including America, Australia, Russia, and Singapore.

‘Interestingly those who did view the castle were fascinated by the history of it and the fact that it was purportedly haunted by the ghost of Lady Barbara Grant, not to mention the misfortune of many previous owners.

‘The new owner is already planning on spending a significant amount on refurbishing the castle and grounds and it reassuring to know that the ancient, ancestral seat of Chiefs of Clan Grant is in safe hands.’

Former Rangers chairman Craig Whyte purchased the property with his wife for £720,000 in 2006

Mr Whyte and his former wife Kim purchased the property for £720,000 in 2006 with a 110 per cent mortgage of £800,000.

But Ms Whyte moved out after their marriage fell apart and Mr Whyte reportedly refused to pay the £7,000-a-month mortgage for two years. 

The Bank of Scotland raised a legal action against him last year and the castle was repossessed in April.

Rangers went into administration under Whyte’s ownership in February 2012, just nine months after he had bought the club from Sir David Murray.

They were subsequently relegated three tiers from the Scottish Premiership to Scottish League Two due to unpaid debts. 

Rangers are currently second in the Scottish Championship after four wins and a defeat to the new season.
