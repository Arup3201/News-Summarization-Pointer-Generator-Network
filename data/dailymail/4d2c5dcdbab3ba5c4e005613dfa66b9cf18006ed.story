With his adorable little face and cute floppy ears, its hard to believe that anybody could be cruel to this young pup.

But 10-week-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier Apollo is lucky to be alive after being found abandoned in a zipped-up laptop bag.

The playful pooch was found by a member of the public under a bush in Cambridge city centre.

She noticed the bulging bag moving as she walked through the city and was shocked when the whimpering pup emerged.

The abandoned dog was then taken to Wood Green Animal Shelter in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, where he is now being cared for by staff.

Linda Cantle, deputy head of animal welfare, said: 'This little dog is lucky to be alive. Apollo would have been hot and barely able to move or even breathe.

'We would urge anyone no longer able to care for their pet to act responsibly and call a rescue centre like Wood Green.'
