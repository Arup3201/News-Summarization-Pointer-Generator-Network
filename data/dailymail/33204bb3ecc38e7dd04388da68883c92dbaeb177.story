Lord Coe today attacked the British press for 'resorting to type' today, accusing them of focusing more on England's football match with Moldova then on one of the last days on the Paralympic Games.

He said newspapers bumped the Paralympics off the back pages usually reserved for sport to concentrate on England's football win

Most papers carried England's 5-0 victory over Moldova to lead their sports coverage, as Roy Hodgson's men opened their World Cup Qualifying campaign with their biggest away win for nearly two decades.

Priorities: Lord Coe accused the press of focusing on England's football performance, instead of the Paralympics

Seb Coe says the future of Paralympic sport rests on the press' coverage

It came on a relatively barren day for ParalympicsGB, as discus thrower Josie Pearson won Great Britain's tenth athletics gold of the Games - but the only top medal of the day.

Her success came nine years after breaking her neck in a car accident, the 26-year-old setting three world records on her way to claiming the discus title.

Lord Coe emphasised that without the press' involvement, the interest around the Paralympics could fade if they did not keep up reports.

Asked how the profile of Paralympic sport could be maintained after the Games, Lord Coe said: 'With your (press) help.

'The future of Paralympic sport in large part lies with you, your editors and the ability of broadcasters to take this beyond the three or four weeks that we've witnessed here.

'It is a challenge for Olympic Sport, it is a challenge for Paralympic Sport.'

In an apparent attack on Paralympic coverage in today's newspapers, the London 2012 chairman criticised 'the speed with which we reverted to back-page leads for England-Moldova'.

He added: 'That relegation happened too quickly. We (the Paralympics Committee) could not have done more in the last seven years to move this on.

'It now sits in a large part with you guys.

'We will go on showing that Paralympic sports is an extraordinary sport. This now sits here.

'The speed with which we resorted to type last night was maybe not a great sign.'

Dry day: Josie Pearson was the only person to bring home a gold medal yesterday, celebrating her win for the Women's Discus F51/52/53

Mickey Bushell , who won Gold in the Mens 100m - T53, came fourth in the final of the men's 200m T53 with an English record of 26.32 seconds
