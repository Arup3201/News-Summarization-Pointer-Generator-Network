The husband of a Delaware state senator turned himself in and was arrested after being caught pulling down Republican Party campaign signs, police said Thursday.

Dana Armon Long, 54, husband of Democrat State Senator Bethany Hall-Long of Middletown where the incident took place, was filmed taking down signs labeled Republican Party of Delaware.

Walking along the road around 4am, Long attempts to hide behind the signs he's carrying as a voice off camera says 'We got you stealing those signs. You're stealing those signs, put them back.'

'We gotcha, brother,' the cameraman tells Long in the video. 'We got your license plate, your face and everything.'

The video was posted to YouTube, with the uploader writing that he joined the local Republican Party chairman to tape after a series of signs were taken down.

Police were shown the video and issued an arrest warrant for Long, said Middletown Police Chief Daniel Yeager. 

'The tape doesn't tell a lie,' he said.

Long surrendered Thursday morning for arrest on a charge of theft and released on bond. The charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine up to $2,300.

'Sadly, this race has become tough and personal,' Hall-Long said in a statement released on Wednesday that said the signs had been handed over to the Democratic Party to be returned.

'My husband is my high school sweetheart and he loves me very much. I was not aware that he had allowed his frustration over the campaign attacks to get the better of him.' 

The area where Long was filmed borders the same road along which 28 signs bearing Republican Party messages were put up Sunday before being stolen. 

Replacement signs were stolen Tuesday. A police report stated that there had been another set of signs stolen earlier. 

Delaware Department of Transportation prohibits posting of signs 10 feet from the edge of highways, but signs posted 30 days before or 30 days after an election are exempt. 

Hall-Long is running against Republican John Marino for the District 10 seat.
