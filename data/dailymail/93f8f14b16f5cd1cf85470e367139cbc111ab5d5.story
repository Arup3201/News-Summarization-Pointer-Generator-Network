Having this year reached its pensionable age of 65,  one of Britain’s best-loved vehicles - and a favourite with the Queen - is to cease production.

For now.

The last of the current Land Rover Defenders will roll-off the production lines of Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) Solihull factory in the West Midlands in December 2015.

But already a bold new successor for the 21st century is on the drawing board ready to replace it. A small ‘family’ of Defenders is even being prepared, including a sporty beach-buggy style.

The Defender is the name given in more recent years to the original Land Rover which was born in 1948.

The
 popular 4x4 vehicle, which is exported all around the world, represents
 the continuation of the very first Land Rover which came on to the 
scene in April 1948 and was modelled on the war-time jeeps.

Featuring
 in the Angelina Jolie film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and in the latest 
James Bond movie, Skyfall, the Defender name itself can be traced back 
to 1990. It was created to avoid confusion with a new Land Rover 
launched the previous year  called Discovery.

Jaguar
 land Rover confirmed that Defender production will cease but stressed a
 new replacement vehicle would join the Land Rover model range, which 
includes the Freelander, the Discovery and the Range Rover.

The last of the models - pictured here being driven by the Queen at the Windsor show - will be produced by Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) at Solihull in the West Midlands in December 2015

At
 the Frankfurt Motor Show two years ago parent company Jaguar Land Rover
 unveiled a macho, testosterone-fuelled open-topped off-roader - 
codenamed DS100 Sport - designed to be as useful off-road as the trusty 
 original. it is likely to be one of a small family of Defenders.

It
 could even be built at their new factory in Puna – whether  in 
knock-down form from kits supplied in Britain, or more radically, in 
India alone.

John 
Edwards, who has just been announced as the head of JLR's new individual
 products division, said the  Defender was ‘loved the world over for its
 simple, honest and distinctive design’ adding:’We are determined that 
the new Defender will be true to its heritage, while meeting the 
requirements of a changing global market.’

He
 added: ’Like no other vehicle, the  Defender inspires affection and 
loyalty the world over. It inspires people to go beyond, whether they 
are explorers, ecologists, UN aid workers or Red cross medics.’

He
 said the Defender is ‘known and loved the world over and that its 
replacement would be ‘instantly recognised’  by anyone who knows the 
current vehicle and the "core values of dependability and functionality’
 would be retained.

Mr Edwards added that the new vehicle ‘won't necessarily be cheap’.

Land
 Rover design director Gerry McGovern  said: ‘Replacing the iconic 
Defender is one of the biggest challenges in the automotive design 
world; it is a car that inspires people worldwide.’

A JLR spokesman said: ‘Production of Defender in its current format will stop at the end of 2015.

'A
 new replacement vehicle will join the Land Rover model range, but we 
have not yet announced the name nor any details of the new product. "The
 Defender in its current format is coming to an end and we are looking 
at what the options are.’

But  Land Rover is already hard at work creating a new replacement  Defender fit for the 21st century.

The much loved vehicle was also featured in the latest James Bond film, Skyfall

The
 proposed new prototype Defender  takes its cue  from the early 
canvas-roofed Defenders with their fold-down windscreens that still 
typify the Land Rover spirit of  adventure and exploration – but with a
 wrap-around aero screen and cut-down side windows for exhilarating  
open-air motoring.

Land Rover holds a royal warrant, as supplier to the royal household.

The royal relationship with Land Rover goes back to to 1948 when King George VI viewed the original Land Rover. 

The
 Queen, who has been pictured at the wheel of Land Rovers, took delivery
 of her first one shortly after coming to the throne in 1952 and has 
used Land Rovers ever since.

'Even its colour – metallic amber – was designed to  
echo the ‘vibrant ochre hues found in Africa.’

However,
 in  keeping with the demands of 21st century motoring, the proposed new
 Defender  also  included a bevy of new hi-tech special features.

These 
include ‘Wade Aid’ which  uses sonar to assess water depth when crossing
 a shallow river or ford; next generation Terrain Response which  
optimises car’s setting for any type of environment; a ‘Terrain-i ‘ 
feature which maps the  contours of what’s ahead to create  3D visual 
map on the dashboard screen and is similar to technology used by fighter
 pilots, and retractable ‘on demand’ tyre spikes for driving on snow and
 ice.

There’s even a park-assist system to help you parallel park .

The
 original and iconic Defender workhorse off-roader began life in 1948 as
 a £450  agricultural aid for farmers. Astonishingly, some 
three-quarters of the 2 million Defenders ever built since then are 
still in regular use.

Land 
Rover holds a royal warrant, as supplier to the royal household. The 
royal relationship with Land Rover goes back to  to 1948 when King 
George VI viewed the original Land Rover.

The
 Queen, who is regularly photographed at the wheel, took delivery of her
 first one shortly after coming to the throne in 1952 and has used Land 
Rovers ever since.

The 
original  Land Rover started life as a squiggle in the sand when, 
shortly after the Second World War, Rover director Maurice Wilks 
sketched out on a beach near his holiday cottage in Anglesey  the 
rufty-tufty vehicle he needed to replace the American army surplus Jeep 
he used while there and on the family’s main home and farm in 
Warwickshire.

So in 1948
 Britain’s answer to the ubiquitous Jeep – the Land Rover - was born and
 launched at that year’s Amsterdam Motor Show as the world’s first 
mass-produced civilian 4X4.  It has been with us ever since. With 
post-war rationing and steel in short supply but masses of aluminium 
around, the vehicle was initially made with the lightweight metal.  The 
original sage-green paint was acquired from a fighter plane factory.

The
 first pilot pre-production model called ‘Huey’ after its registration 
number   HUE 166, and is fully working and on  display at the Heritage 
Motor Museum in Gaydon, Warwickshire.

The
 Queen used a specially adapted one for her first world tour in 1953, 
Winston Churchill was given one as an 80th birthday present at his home 
in Chartwell, while another was used for  Pope John Paul II’s  tour of 
England in 1982.

And 
shortly after ending his love affair with young Princess Margaret in the
 1950s, former battle of Britain pilot Group Captain  Peter Townsend  
set off on a 57,000 mile journey around the world  in his short 
Wheelbase Land Rover Station Wagon which he completed in 1957 and 
chronicled in his book ‘Earth, My Friend.’
