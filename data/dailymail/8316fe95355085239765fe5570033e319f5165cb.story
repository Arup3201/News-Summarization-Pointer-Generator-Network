A group of Northern Territory cooks are rivalling the French's renowned frog legs by coming up with their own delicacy – the poisonous cane toad.

The cooks have started using the legs of the pest species in six different dishes and are dubbing it the 'new feral fine food'.

Darwin food blogger Emma Lupin said the cane toad was overlooked as a food source.

'There are just so many cane toads it is mind boggling, but they are also surprisingly easy to catch,' Ms Lupin, who is part of the GULP NT blog, said.

'The most humane way reported is to catch them by the back legs and whip them into a dark airtight canoe bag, you don't want to stress them out.'

Ms Lupin's blog – Growing and Understanding Local Produce – is part of a community project that focuses on using locally grown foods.

The GULP team are the ones behind the cane toad leg recipes.

The cane toads are killed by freezing them before cutting off their legs

The legs of the cane toad are then skinned to rid it of its poisonous skin

Ms Lupin has experimented with a number of recipes including marinating the toad legs in soy, garlic, ginger and chilli

 INGREDIENTS

8 toads legs with skins removed

2 tbls butter

3 cloves of garlic

Salt and Pepper to taste

1 baguette 

Garlic chives, finely chopped

METHOD

1. Melt butter in a heavy based sauce pan and fry garlic until softened

2. Add toad legs and cook in butter until tender

3. Lightly toast the baguette

4. Serve two toad legs on a piece of baguette

5. Drizzle with garlic butter and garnished with chives

'I tried marinating them in soy, garlic, ginger and chilli. After a couple of hours in the fridge I sautéed them in sesame oil and served them with heaps of local Vietnamese coriander and random salad greens, including sweet leaf and rosella leaves,' Ms Lupin said.

Cane toads produce poison through its parotid gland and some parts of its body are poisonous for many species including humans.

Ms Lupin said the way cane toads are killed is important because they disperse more poison when stressed.

'So give them the most calm end possible,' she said.

'After you have a few pop them in the freezer. After sufficiently frozen thaw these guys out… (and) with a meat cleaver or sharp knife cut off their legs.

'Because of the fact these creatures contain poison in their back and skin, you want to skin them and avoid the upper body. We skinned the legs which is really easy.'

The group experimented with cooking road kill like snakes and wallabies before turning to cane toads.

'If you are going to try some pest management, you might as well get some protein from this unwanted visitor,' Ms Lupin said.
