Miami-Dade County prosecutors have released 10 hours of jail surveillance footage which shows Justin Bieber after his drunk driving arrest in January.

In one clip, Bieber wavers as he tries to walk heel to toe, then  stumbles slightly as he turns and appears to have his arms out for balance. And at another point, the bored pop star starts doing push-ups in his cell.

The new footage was released just a day after police in Atlanta seized marijuana in an SUV at his house.

After the arrest: Justin Bieber is pictured in surveillance footage following his arrest last month for drunk driving

Wavering: In the few moments showing Bieber, he walks a line as part of a sobriety test, but seems unbalanced

Facing the charges: A court date for the DUI case is set for March 3

High: Lab results later found Xanax and marijuana in Bieber's system at the time of his arrest

Bored Bieber? Once by himself in a cell, the bored singer started doing push-ups to pass the time

The arrest video was sought by The Associated Press and other media organizations under Florida's public records law.

Attorneys for the 19-year-old singer persuaded a judge to withhold four clips depicting Bieber urinating in a cup for a drug test.

According to his lawyers, the video shows Beiber in 'various states of undress which show personal parts'.

Happy-go-lucky: Bieber was in a surprisingly good mood when he got his mugshot taken following the arrest

Fast and furious: The singer, right, was caught drag-racing through a residential area in his yellow Lamborghini

A source who viewed the video told TMZ: 'Justin is seen several times stumbling around while he was taking his tests. As if he had a problem with his balance ... [the video] also shows Justin taking his various tests and eventually taking a piss.

'The stumbling and going to the bathroom is obviously reason enough for his attorneys to request it be sealed ... If I was trying to paint a picture that my client was innocent ... I wouldn’t want a video of him stumbling around and looking out of it to go public either.

The police previously released footage taken after the arrest at the beginning of February, which shows the singer being patted down by officers.

Leaning on a table as the police officer gets to work at the task in hand, the Baby hitmaker seemed to be taking his time as he meandered around the area.

Complying with orders: Putting on a typically confident display, the 19-year-old singer can be seen strutting around as he follows the officer's orders

Wearing a dark hoodie, baggy black shorts and red trainers, the teen heartthrob is told to remove his shoes as the search takes place.

Although the police officer in question seems to be paying close attention to searching Bieber, they found nothing on him after the frisk took place.

Later tests revealed his blood alcohol level was below the limit for drivers, but at the age of 19, the young star is still two years underage. Marijuana and Xanax were also found in his system.

Bieber has pleaded not guilty to driving under the influence, resisting arrest and invalid-license charges following his January 23 arrest. A trial date has been set for March 3.

Meanwhile, Bieber is juggling his many other run-ins with the law.

The singer could now be charged with felony vandalism after allegedly pelting his neighbor's property with eggs last month.

Police arrive to raid Justin Bieber's Calabasas mansion after Los Angeles law enforcement executed a felony search warrant

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department has sent the case to the district attorney, with officers 
strongly recommending prosecution on a more serious felony charge after 
an estimated $20,000 in damages was caused.

It comes hot on the heels of his party pal Lil Za being charged with three felonies in connection to a raid on Justin's $6million mansion last week.

The L.A. County D.A. reportedly charged the rapper with two counts of felony possession of a controlled substance, and another relating to breaking a jail telephone.

Police made the charges after they had initially been called to Justin's house following the egg pelting incident. If found guilty he could face up to nine years in prison.

Bieber has also been accused of abusing a flight attendant on a private jet until she was forced to hide in the cockpit.

Flying high: Bieber and his father allegedly smoked weed on a private plane they took to the Super Bowl

The troubled teen singer and his entourage were said to have smoked so much marijuana on the flight between Canada and New Jersey that the pilots were forced to wear oxygen masks.

Bieber his father Jeremy, 38, and ten friends travelled on the leased jet to Teterboro airport ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday and were allegedly so verbally abusive towards the female flight attendant that she refuses to work for him again.

Despite several warnings, the singer and his father Jeremy would not stop verbally abusing the flight attendant, and she eventually hid in the cockpit with the pilots to avoid Bieber and his entourage.

In addition to his pending criminal case in Florida, Bieber has another case pending in his native Canada.

Growing violent: Bieber is also facing charges in Canada for assaulting a limo driver in an argument over volume

He turned himself into Toronto authorities earlier this month after being charged with assault on a limo driver.

TMZ reported that the fight began when Bieber asked for the music to be turned up. The driver obliged, but not as much as Bieber was hoping, so he apparently stuck his hand through the partition to do it himself.

The driver swatted his hand away and then it allegedly erupted into a full-on smack fest as Bieber hit the driver in the head multiple times.

While Justin has grown increasingly close to his father in the wake of his legal woes, Patti Mallette - who raised the star as a single mother - has admitted she has little control over her son's behaviour.

She told Access Hollywood Live: 'I've just gotta let go a little and let him make some of his own decisions. He's growing up. He's 19. He's not my baby. Of course I pray for him and encourage him.'
