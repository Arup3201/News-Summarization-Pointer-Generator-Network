He has been named today as Charlie Hancock, of Pagham. The Sussex and Surrey Major Crime Division confirmed they are treating the death as a murder investigation.

A 41-year-old local man, believed to be the driver of the car, has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm.

Detective Inspector Wendy Burton, of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'We are appealing to anyone who saw two men having an altercation while in a grey Chrysler Voyager vehicle in Rowan Way, Bognor, between 9.30pm and 10pm on Monday, to come forward.

'We would also like to hear from any friends of Charlie who may have seen him on Monday as we are trying to trace his movements.'
