It seems these pouting pets have been taking tips out of selfie Queen Kim Kardashian's book - as they appear to pose for their own self portraits. 

This gang of attention-seeking cats has taken to the 'selfie' trend, snapping candid pictures of themselves while their owners are seemingly none the wiser.  The feline frames have been compiled by cat owner Charlie Ellis, from Reading, Berkshire, who has scoured the globe for the perfect puss pictures.

In his book Cat Selfies moggies try their hand at  the craze - with highly amusing results. 

 Mr Ellis said: 'My cat accidentally took a photo on my tablet, and it turned out better than my selfies. It was so funny I wanted to share the hilarity with everyone. Summersdale - my publisher - ran a big competition asking for cat and dog selfies, with the best ones being in the book, and there was a huge response.

'It's so hard to choose a favourite, Belang - on page 41 - is giving good face and working both paws. That cat has really mastered the art of the selfie.

'It was the most enjoyable few weeks of my life when the pictures were pouring in. After publication, Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium in London ran a competition for cat selfies and there were even more fabulous cats. Cat Selfies is available from all good retailers, both online and on the high street.
