Roy Keane has been named as Aston Villa's new assistant manager and will combine the role with his post as Martin O'Neill's No 2 for the Republic of Ireland.

The 42-year-old will work alongside Paul Lambert at Villa Park and said he was 'relishing the prospect' of combining the two roles.

'I am delighted to be joining Aston Villa and I look forward to what promises to be an exciting challenge,' Keane said in a statement released by Villa on Tuesday afternoon.

Joint roles: Roy Keane has been named as Aston Villa's No 2 but will also work with the Republic of Ireland

'I am grateful to both Villa and the 
Football Association of Ireland for making this happen and I would like 
also to thank Martin Oâ€™Neill.

'I
 am relishing the prospect of linking up with Paul Lambert and combining
 both roles to the full advantage of both Villa and Ireland'.

Keane will begin his new job ahead of the Villa squad's return to pre-season training on Monday.

Lambert
 said he was looking forward to Keane's input as Villa bid to improve on
 last season's miserable 15th place finish in the Barclays Premier 
League.

The manager said: 
'Roy has a great knowledge of football, on the coaching side as well, 
and he'll be a great asset and a big help to everybody here at Aston 
Villa Football Club,' Lambert said.

'I'm really looking forward to working with him and I'm delighted that he's here.

'As
 a player, he was one of the most accomplished in the history of the 
Barclays Premier League and he's brought that experience gained over 
many years into his career in coaching and management. The players will 
love working with him.

'Although
 we never played together, we competed against one another and he's 
someone for whom I have a lot of time and respect. He has worked under 
some great managers, some of the most successful in the game, and he'll 
be a great help to myself as well.

Help: Paul Lambert will be assisted by Keane as Aston Villa look to improve on last season's 15th place

'Roy
 brought Sunderland up out of the Championship and into the Premier 
League, he gained further experience at Ipswich - where we were close 
rivals while I was manager at Norwich - and he's now working at 
international level as assistant manager with the Republic of Ireland.

'All
 of that experience and knowledge along with the qualities he has as a 
longstanding, leading professional in the game means he will bring a lot
 to the table. We're delighted to have him here.'

Lambert's
 coaching staff was significantly depleted last season when assistant 
Ian Culverhouse and football operations manager Gary Karsa were 
suspended and then sacked for unspecified disciplinary reasons.

The
 former Sunderland and Ipswich manager returned to the game in November 
last year when O'Neill offered him the opportunity to return to the 
international fold.

He has clearly enjoyed his time to date with the Republic, for whom he played with such distinction, and that proved a key factor in his decision to reject the vacancy at Celtic following Neil Lennon's departure.

Keane's presence within the Ireland camp has raised his profile once again and O'Neill admitted at the height of the speculation at the end of May and the beginning of July that the former Manchester United skipper would inevitably be courted by other potential employers.
