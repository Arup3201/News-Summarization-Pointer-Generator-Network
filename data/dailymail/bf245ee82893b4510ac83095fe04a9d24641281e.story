Safe standing at football matches will be piloted in Wales if Welsh politicians and fans get their way.

Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies launched a report in Swansea on Monday backing the introduction of designated standing areas and has called on the UK Government to follow the Welsh Assembly's cross-party support for the proposals.

The report comes on the back of a survey of 2,364 fans which showed that 96 per cent back a safe standing pilot to trial modern stadium technology, while 84 per cent believe that safe standing areas would decrease the likelihood of conflict between stewards and fans.

The introduction of safe standing has the backing of the Football Supporters' Federation and the Supporters' Trusts of the four main professional clubs in Wales - Swansea, Cardiff, Newport and Wrexham.

'I see safe standing as a way forward for football,' Davies said.

'I do not see how we continue with the current legislation because the safety concerns have been addressed and ultimately football is not just about watching it on TV.

'It's about getting a great match-day experience and I believe with modern stadia like the Liberty Stadium I believe we can achieve that.

'This report is based on fans' views and there is a body of evidence which shows that the match-day experience can be greatly enhanced with safe standing.'

Davies believes Britain needs to follow the example of the continent on safe standing and insists safety would not be compromised.

Crumbling terraces were a regular feature of football in the 1980s and 96 Liverpool fans lost their lives at the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989 when supporters were crushed behind fences.

In Germany clubs like Schalke, Borussia Dortmund and Borussia Monchengladbach employ standing areas and adapt their grounds to UEFA all-seater requirements by bolting temporary seats to the steps of conventional terraces and removing the crush barriers.

Others like Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern Munich and Hamburg use seats in European competition that fold away under aluminium terrace steps for Bundesliga games.

'Look at Germany and other countries in Europe and I believe we can follow the protocols when it comes to safety to create an even better product,' Davies said.

In Germany, teams such as Bayern Munich allow safe standing through rail seats which can fold away

'Market research has also shown that when you do have a standing environment then ticket prices will tend to drop but this isn't about cramming people into terraces as it was historically.

'This is about people being in a designated spot in a stadium and making sure people are marshalled correctly.'

The move has been backed by the FSF who represent supporters in England and Wales and have held a long-running campaign to re-introduce safe standing areas into domestic football.

FSF director of communications Michael Brunskill said: 'When we ask people why do they back safe standing the main reason is atmosphere.

'When you're in church and you want to sing you stand, it's the same with football and you already see that in the Premier League that people will stand in seated areas to sing.

'All we're saying is why don't we design these areas properly to cater for that.'

Supporters of Cardiff and Swansea have praised the report and would like to see a pilot scheme introduced in Wales whoever wins the General Election in May.

Tim Hartley, chairman of the Cardiff City Supporters' Trust, said the Sky Bet Championship club allowed supporters to stand in one area of the Cardiff City Stadium but there have been high-profile cases in the past, most notably involving Trafford Council and Manchester United, where the local authority have waged campaigns to stop fans standing at matches.

'We are lucky at Cardiff where we have a liberal interpretation of the regulations and fans are allowed to stand in the Canton Stand,' Hartley said.

'The law says you must have all-seater stadia in the top two tiers in England and Wales, the regulations say that persistent standing should not be tolerated.

Swansea City supporters could soon be cheering on their team while standing at the Liberty Stadium

'That's a civil matter and it's up to the club whether they want to take you through the civil court and Cardiff choose not to because they know it's safe.'

Swansea director Huw Cooze said: 'We'd like to see standing trialled whether that's lower down the league and filters up to us in the Premier League.

'We've seen it work in Germany and we like what we see.'
