Strictly Come Dancing made Susanna Reid a star, but it appears to have cost the BBC Breakfast presenter her relationship.

While Reid has spent the past few weeks on the road for Strictly’s live arena tour, her long-term partner and father of her three children, Dominic Cotton, has had enough and separated from her — signing up to a dating website to find new love.

It is just the latest example of the ‘Curse of Strictly’, which has seen numerous couples split up after appearances on the BBC show.

In his profile on Match.com, the 
46-year-old former BBC sports journalist says: ‘Underneath my blokeish 
exterior I am a sensitive soul.

'I enjoy sharing things and am someone 
who doesn’t shy away from commitment. Life is for living with someone 
special.’

Cotton, who has known Reid for 15 years, says on the website he is ‘currently separated’, looking for a woman aged 35 to 45.

After listing his interests, which 
include ‘spending time with my kids’, he sees himself as ‘trendy’ and of
 ‘attractive appearance’ — and reveals his ‘best feature’ is his ‘bum’. 

Dance: Susanna Reid wowed the judges on the BBC prime time show Strictly Come Dancing

Reid's agent confirmed the split on Friday in a statement: 'Susanna Reid and Dominic Cotton have agreed to separate but remain good friends.

'The welfare of their children remains paramount for both of them at this time. Please respect their space and privacy.'

Reid’s
 punishing work schedule is unlikely to have helped. She 
makes a five-hour round trip from her home in South London to present 
BBC Breakfast from the Salford studios, Monday to Wednesday.

Reid wakes at 3.30am to head to the studio, films the three-hour show before catching the train to London to pick up her three young sons from school. She spends the evening with them before catching another train back north for the night.

She also had to fit in training and filming for the last series of Strictly, on which she and her dance partner, Kevin Clifton, finished second behind footballer’s wife Abbey Clancy.

After the end of Strictly’s TV run in December, Dominic admitted Susanna’s schedule had been ‘tough’ and ‘really full on’. He said he was ‘looking forward to having my partner back’.

Before appearing in Strictly, Susanna said she believed Dominic was a better parent to their sons than she was.

‘He’s always hands-on, but more so recently. He’s doing the stuff we normally share — parents’ evenings, homework. He’s unrivalled as a parent. I can’t even come close.’

When I asked Reid last night if it was true they had separated, as Cotton said on the dating website, she replied: ‘I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to discuss this.’ Cotton, interim chief executive at charity UK Youth, declined to return my calls.

Earlier this month, Reid was reportedly offered £1million to switch to ITV.
