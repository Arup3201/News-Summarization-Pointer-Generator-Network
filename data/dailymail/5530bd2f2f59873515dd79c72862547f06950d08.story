Figures released by Eric Pickles' Department for Communities and Local Government show around one in 10 local authority home is now occupied by foreign tenants

Around one in ten local authority homes were let last year to foreign tenants, figures showed last night.

The proportion has soared since David Cameron entered Downing Street.

Last year, 9 per cent of social housing properties which were let out were occupied by foreign tenants – up from 6 per cent in the final year of the last Labour government.  

The statistics, released by Eric Pickles’ Department for Communities and Local Government, show that this proportion of lettings is the highest in England since at least 2006/7.

The figures also show that the number of homes let out to Eastern Europeans had doubled since the Coalition was formed in 2010 to 4 per cent.

The DCLG document said this could be down to the fact that Britain’s borders have been opened to Bulgarians and Romanians.

The figures are another problem for David Cameron as he struggles to persuade voters the Conservatives can get to grips with immigration.

Ministers have already been forced to admit they will not meet the election pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands by next eyar. Latest figures show that annual net migration is now at 260,000 – higher than when they took office.

Last month, Mr Cameron unveiled proposals to prevent migrants from accessing social housing until they have been paying tax in this country for at least four years.

The increase was condemned by the cross-party Commons group on balanced migration, chaired by Labour’s Frank Field and the Tories’ Sir Nicholas Soames.

In a statement, they said: ‘The proportion of social housing going to non-British nationals continues to increase.

‘This nationwide figure of one in ten disguises local variations where the impact has been much higher. A stronger priority for social housing should be given to long-standing local residents.’

The DCLG document, Social Housing Lettings, said that 91 per cent of social properties are occupied by UK nationals and 4 per cent by Eastern Europeans – that is people from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.

A further 1 per cent are occupied by people from other EU countries, and 4 per cent by other non-UK nationals.

‘The proportion of tenants who were UK nationals fell by 1 percentage point a year from 2009/10 to 2012/13 and remained static in 2013/14, whilst those from A8 countries has rsien slowly from 1 per cent in 2007/08 to 4 per cent in 2013/14,’ the document said.

‘A factor in this could be that since 2008/9, the list of A8 countries has expanded to include Bulgaria and Romania.’

A8 countries are Eastern European countries who joined the EU in 2004. They do not include Bulgaria and Romania, who joined later.

A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: ‘It is in everyone’s interest to remove unnecessary barriers which prevent homes being made available to those people who desperately need them.

‘Councils are keen to play their part in this and could go further and faster to support the development of badly needed new homes if Government gave councils greater financial flexibility.’

Housing minister Brandon Lewis said that the figures would fall next year after new measures introduced by the government.

‘These figures do not take account of the new guidance we’ve put in place to ensure councils are completely clear about who they have given social homes to, so communities can be confident they are not losing out,’ he said.

‘For years families suffered the blatant unfairness of watching as people with no job or connection to the local area were given council homes. Under this Government new rules make crystal clear that local people and members of the Armed Forces are at the front of the queue for council homes in their area.

‘As a result, I expect next year’s figures to change as councils put these rules into practice.’
