A 22-month-old girl from Mexico is the latest to be hit by a measles outbreak traced to Disney theme parks in California.

The unidentified infant, who was not vaccinated, apparently visited the tourist attraction with family from December 16 to 18.

There are now 42 patients who have been struck down by the viral disease including five Disney employees.

Of the workers at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, three have fully recovered and returned to work, and two remain off, said Dr. Pamela Hymel, the chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.

All of Disney's 'cast members,' as it calls park employees, have been offered immunity tests and vaccinations since the company first heard of the outbreak January 7, Hymel said. 

Those who have been in close contact with infected employees are put on paid leave until their immunity can be established.

Several dozen measles cases have emerged in California, four other states and Mexico in the outbreak linked to December visits to Disney theme parks in Orange County.

Oregon became the latest state affected Tuesday when state officials confirmed that a Eugene man in his 40s had contracted the disease after visiting Disney parks.

Orange County has confirmed 18 cases there in the past month, though six were not connected to the theme parks, said its health agency spokeswoman Deanne Thompson.

At nearby Huntington Beach High School, at least 23 unvaccinated students have been sent home after a student was confirmed to be infected with measles.

Students without a measles vaccination were told to stay home until January 29 to avoid a spread of the disease that has symptoms including fever and a blotchy body rash.

State law requires schoolchildren to get vaccinated to protect against measles, mumps and rubella, but parents can get an exemption by signing a personal belief waiver.

Many parents who reject vaccines or delay them fear there are links between the vaccines and medical conditions such as autism. 

Numerous studies have dismissed an autism link.

'It is at large in the community now, and particularly infants too young to be immunized, people with other health conditions and, of course, people who aren't immunized need to be very concerned,' Thompson said.

She added that unvaccinated people 'really should rethink that and consider getting vaccinated.' 

Measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in an infected person's nose and throat mucus and spreads through coughing and sneezing, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and a red rash that usually first appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body.

Health experts say the best prevention against measles is vaccination. 

While officials declared measles eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 because of a lack of continuous transmission, the illness is still brought into the country by foreign visitors or unvaccinated Americans.
