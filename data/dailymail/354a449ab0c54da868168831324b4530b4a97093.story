Council officers in Scotland are turning up the heat on night-time dog walkers who let their pets poop in public spaces – by tracking culprits using thermal imaging equipment.

The advanced technology – which is usually used to catch criminals and dangerous drivers - is being deployed by Fife Council because the problem of dog mess in Fife has become a major problem.

The thermal cameras will be able to detect the body heat of dogs and their owners - and recently produced poo - from hundreds of yards away.

The council officers who will be tasked with handing out fines will also be given stab vests to protect themselves from any violent or aggressive dog owners.

A street cleaning survey in the region showed that 88 per cent of respondents rated fouling as a problem in their area, higher than any other street cleaning issue.

The council’s environmental enforcement wardens can hand out fixed penalty fines for dog fouling, litter dropping, abandoned vehicles and fly tipping.

Thermal-imaging cameras see light on the infrared spectrum, which the human eye cannot pick up.

The hotter an object, the more infrared radiation is emitted. Hot objects glow brightly when seen through an infrared filter. It is customary to mark out hot objects with a white colour and cold objects in black.

Temperatures in between are coloured red and yellow.

Infrared radiation was discovered by British astronomer Sir Frederick William Herschel in 1800.

However, officers said that not all culprits take kindly to the serving of such notices.

Jim Beveridge, an environment enforcer at Fife Council, said: ‘It could get dangerous when issuing a fine.

‘People don’t like to be charged, so we always wear stab-proof vests because you never know what people are carrying these days.

‘There is no excuse for people turning away, ignoring and failing to pick up their dog’s mess, even if they take one step away from the dog-fouling I would be tempted to fine them because they have no intention of picking it up.’

A Fife Council spokesman said: ‘Staff are expected to wear their vests when on patrol or issuing a fixed penalty notice.’

Meanwhile, community safety operations manager, Mark McCall said that the use of infra-red technology ultimately leads to improved quality of life for Fifers.

He said: ‘The CCTV vehicle we are using for this is owned by Fife Community Safety Partnership.

‘It is used by partners for a range of projects that aim to make our communities safer and more pleasant places for residents to live.

‘The vehicle is used for other activities such as monitoring traffic calming measures, littering, at football matches or other big events and in town centres at night to monitor street disorders.’
