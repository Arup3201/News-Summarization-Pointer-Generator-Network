Everton and Liverpool played out a disappointing 0-0 draw at Goodison Park in Saturday's Merseyside derby.

Despite all the pre-match hype, the game failed to really get going and there were only a handful of clear-cut opportunities.

Tensions flared towards the end of the match and the players came together in the centre of the pitch

EVERTON (4-3-3)

Joel Robles - 7

Was always in the right place to deal with the shots Liverpool had and grew in confidence through the game. 

Phil Jagielka - 7

Not one of his most taxing derbies as Liverpool kept playing the ball in front of him.

Bryan Oviedo - 6.5

The natural deputy for the injured Leighton Baines, stuck to a difficult task of keeping tabs on Jordan Ibe. 

Seamus Coleman - 7

Solid and assured at the back in his battle with Alberto Moreno, didn’t have the biggest contribution going forward.

John Stones - 7

Generally neat and tidy but not the commanding display he produced against Manchester City last month.

Muhamad Besic (replaced by Antolin Alcaraz on 86 mins) - 7.5

Getting better with each game he plays, relished the physical combat of this game and his tackles had punch.

Kevin Mirallas (replaced by Aaron Lennon on 60 mins) - 6

One of the few Everton players to find any kind of rhythm, his pace always had Liverpool’s defenders on alert. 

Steven Naismith (replaced by Ross Barkley on 85 mins) - 6.5

Honest and reliable as always, made a big contribution to clear Gerrard’s acrobatic attempt to score.

James McCarthy - 6

Hadn’t kicked a ball since December 28 and it showed. Clearly unfit, his inclusion was a gamble by Roberto Martinez.

Gareth Barry - 5.5

A key cog in Martinez’s team last year, the former England man is struggling to have a similar impact this time around.

Romelu Lukaku - 6

Barely involved but, in his defence, he was barely given any service to make a big impact.

Substitutes: 

Aaron Lennon (replaced Mirallas on 60 mins) - 6

Ross Barkley (replaced Naismith on 85 mins)

Antolin Alcaraz (replaced Besic on 86 mins) 

Aaron Lennon came off the Everton bench to make his Toffees debut at Goodison Park

Subs not used: Darron Gibson, Aruna Kone, Tyias Browning, Russell Griffiths

LIVERPOOL (3-4-3)

Simon Mignolet - 7

Footwork wasn’t always faultless but, other than that, commanding and untroubled for much of the contest.

Mamadou Sakho - 6.5 

Never gives confidence that he has control of the ball when in possession; lucky to get away with hesitancy at times.

Martin Skrtel - 8

Best defender on the pitch, won everything that game near him, whether it was on the floor or in the air. 

Emre Can - 7

Has given Liverpool a good balance in defence; might be a midfielder naturally but is blossoming in this role.

Alberto Moreno - 6

Has established himself in the left wing-back role; nothing spectacular from him but did his duties.

Lucas Leiva (replaced by Joe Allen on 16 mins) - 5

Missed the FA Cup win at Bolton Wanderers because of a thigh injury and the problem flared up again after 15 minutes.

Jordan Henderson - 7.5

Kept things simple, got through the work that was required of him and tried to get his side on the front foot. 

Jordan Ibe - 8.5

Surprise inclusion in the team but took his chance and nearly did it spectacularly with a 25-yard shot against the post.

Steven Gerrard - 6

Wanted to write another fairytale in his final league derby but saw Naismith block his big chance. 

Philippe Coutinho (replaced by Daniel Sturridge on 56 mins) - 6

A couple of sharp passes threatened to open the door but injury ended up curtailing his evening. 

Raheem Sterling (replaced by Rickie Lambert on 82 mins) - 6

His speed off the mark had Everton’s defenders permanently on edge but he wasteful when he got a sight of goal.
