Levi and Nevada received treatment for their injuries

A 13-year-old boy has escaped serious injury after putting his right arm through a glass window during a failed ice bucket challenge.

Victorian teenager Levi Childe was preparing to perform his nominated deed for charity when his younger brother, Nevada, distracted him during filming outside his Geelong home.

Upset by his brother's attempts to foil his challenge, Levi turned and tried to punch him only to have his arm go straight through the glass pane. 

Paramedics were called to the Geelong home after his mother, Clare, stormed out of the shower naked when she heard a 'massive crash.' 

 'I didn't know whether to put clothes on, call 000 or put his arm back together,' she told 9NEWS. 

Reacting to the 'terror screams' she and a neighbour came running to the boy's aid after he fled screaming in horror while his brother laughed.

Ms Childe said her neighbour managed to stay calm enough to follow the instructions of the Triple Zero operator.

'She heard all the screams and she fell over on the grass out the front she was running so fast,' Ms Childe said.

Levi will need to wear a cast for at least six weeks after severing three tendons in his wrist and fingers

'We both were ringing Triple zero, they managed to calm her down, so she could save the situation. 

Levi was operated on the next day with doctors confirming he had severed tendons in his wrist and two fingers, narrowly avoiding nerve damage. 

Nevada also suffered cuts to his leg from the broken glass which fell inside the room he was standing. 

Levi can be overheard telling his brother in the grainy footage filmed on a mobile phone that he is going to 'smack' him just moments before he puts his arm through the window. 

The 13-year-old will have to wear a cast for up to six weeks and is undergoing hand therapy treatment as part of his recovery.

Ms Childe said she hasn't been able to bring herself to watch the footage.
