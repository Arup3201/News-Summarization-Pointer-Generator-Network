There was chaos for tens of thousands of commuters tonight after a man trespassed on the tracks of one of Britain's busiest railway stations.

The man, wearing white shorts, a white Adidas T-shirt and a black 'bum bag' is believed to have walked off the end of platforms 13 and 14 at London's Waterloo station at 4.40pm today.

All trains in and out of the 19-platform terminal were cancelled for 45 minutes while police and paramedics retrieved the man and walked him back to the station.

Trespass: Police escort a man who trespassed on the tracks near London's Waterloo Station, blocking all 19 platforms for almost an hour and disrupting tens of thousands of commuters travelling home

Concerns: The man was detained under the Mental Health Act and taken to hospital for assessment

Not a perfect Friday night: Waterloo station was still packed hours after the incident with services in disarray

He was detained under the Mental Health Act and taken to hospital for assessment.

But the lines being blocked for such a long period during the rush hour meant there was a crush of thousands of people inside the station.

It meant chaos for those who use Waterloo as the sole point of departure for huge tracts of south west London alongside destinations like Southampton and Portsmouth.

The closures also affected the thousands of sports fans travelling in and out of Wimbledon for the tennis championships, where Andy Murray thrashed Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets this afternoon.

A South West Trains spokesman said: 'We are sorry for the extensive 
disruption to services today.

Rush hour: The incident happened at 4.40pm on a Friday, when Waterloo is usually already heaving with people

Where to now? Passengers were delayed for several hours after the incident, which backed up all lines

'A serious trespass incident at London 
Waterloo caused all lines to be blocked for around 45 minutes.

'This 
length of closure has caused significant disruption to all South West 
Trains routes.

'Stations across the network are very busy, customers will have to wait for some time before boarding trains.

'There is disruption to services running on all routes.'

A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'Officers were called to Waterloo station at 4.40pm on Friday 27 June after reports of a man trespassing on the line.

Heating up: There was nothing for stranded passengers but to bake in the afternoon sun under the glass roof

'Officers attended alongside colleagues from the London Ambulance Service.

'A man was detained under the Mental Health Act and taken to hospital for assessment.'

The disruption came just a day after Waterloo - the country's biggest railway station - had to be evacuated.

The entire station was cleared after a fire alarm was set off at lunchtime yesterday.

It turned out to be a false alarm - but still wreaked havoc for thousands of passengers.

Advice to passengers on Friday evening:

Dorking passengers can join Southern 
services from London Victoria/Clapham Junction or use alternative trains
 to Epsom and change there for Southern services.

Chessington South passengers may need to travel to alternative stations then use buses.

Hampton Court passengers may need to travel to Kingston or Subiton then use buses.

No trains will run through from London Waterloo to 
Exeter this evening. Until then Exeter/Salisbury trains will only run 
between Basingstoke and Exeter/Salisbury. Customers will need to use 
alternative services between London Waterloo and Basingstoke and change 
there to complete their journey, but connections 
cannot be guaranteed. Customers can also use services from London 
Paddington.

First Capital Connect will accept customers to Wimbledon.

First Great Western, London Overground and London Underground will accept ticket holders via reasonable routes.
