A derelict potting shed and greenhouse have been transformed into a luxury country cottage - with a pricetag of £450,000.

The ruined Victorian buildings were once home to squirrels, mice and birds. After three years of refurbishing work, the land is home to a luxury five-bedroom family home.

Country lover Trevor Thompson, 52, spotted the old gardening sheds while out walking one day and knew he had found his dream spot.

His wife Suzanne, 51, said: 'He came home that day with a certain look in his eyes.

'He’d seen the land and the buildings and fallen in love.'

Mrs
 Thompson went with him to the old potting shed and greenhouse in the 
Brecon Beacons National Park in South Wales and was bowled over.

For three years the Thompson boys helped their father build their dream home. Their mother said: 'It was a real family effort and I'm so proud of how the boys helped.'

Mr Thompson, a builder by trade, spent three years working on the home which is now called The Market Garden. The family will soon begin renovating another house

The house started to look more like a family home when Mr Thompson began building in basic facilities

The couple decided to bid for the shed at auction and secured the property for £200,000.

The pair sold their home and moved their five sons into a caravan on the plot for Trevor to start work.

Three years later, the project was finished and the family moved into their new home they christened The Market Garden.

Mrs Thompson said: 'We bought the house at auction and started the process of applying for planning permission.

'The National Park had agreed plans for a two bed bungalow but we wanted to extend further.

'It was a real family effort and I’m so proud of how the boys helped.

'We lived and breathed the conversion for three years. We envisaged our dream home and knew all the hard work would get us there in the end.'

The couple and their sons twins Lee and Gary, 26, Danny, 23, and Jake and Zak, 18, who are also twins, lived at the cottage near the village of Talgarth for six years.

Significant work had to be done to transform the property into the £450,000 house that it is today

Idyllic: The house, located in the Brecon Beacons national park in South Wales, looks out onto stunning scenery with views onto neighbouring hills and fields. After living in the property for six years, the Thompson have now put the cottage up for auction

After: The hard work paid off for the Thompson family after they transformed a derelict potting shed into this stunning countryside retreat (pictured). The Thompson also built in a beautiful patio which looks onto the Welsh countryside

Inside: The house has a huge kitchen and living area with glass doors looking out on to the garden

Builder Mr Thompson built the house inside and out from a derelict potting shed to a luxury family home with five bedrooms and modern utilities

But the hard work has not come to an end for Mr and Mrs Thompson. They have now put the property on the market and they are planning to build another dream home from scratch

But the Thompsons are now putting the five-bedroomed property on the market after the oldest boys left home.

The couple are looking or a new project in the area which will mean them moving into a caravan all over again.

Mrs Thompson said: 'People think we are mad but the new project will hopefully clear our mortgage and give us a bit of financial freedom.

'Trevor is brilliant at what he does and I’m excited to start building our new home with him at the helm.'

McCartneys Auctioneers and Estate Agents, who are selling The Market Garden, describe the Thompson’s home as a “unique property and a rare opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind conversion.”

A spokesman said: 'The property has literally grown out of an old potting shed.

'When you look at the old photographs it’s a remarkable conversion and will make someone a lovely new home.'
