No matter how bad you think you are at parking, chances are you're better than this Russian driver.

In a video reportedly released by police, the driver can be seen to accidentally bash into another car while parking.

But rather than owning up to the incident he attempts to speed off, crashing into another four parked cars and eventually flipping his own vehicle.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The driver hits the final vehicle with such force that his own car begins to flip

The vehicle continues moving forward as two of its wheels leave the ground following the collision

The 37 sercond clip, which has been 
watched more than 53,000 times onÂ LiveLeak shows the driver, believed to
be a taxi driver, initially bump into a silver Toyota as he attempts to
park.

The bump sets off the parked car's alarm, which causes the driver to reverse and attempt to flee.

He sets off down through the car park but immediately hits a parked 4x4.

Undeterred, he speeds up before seeming to hit another three cars.

According to police, the driver was in fact sober

The car comes to rest on its side, immediately next to another vehicle

The final collision then flips the car on its side and sets off the windscreen wipers.

According to LiveLeak, police have said the taxi driver was in fact determined to be completely sober.

Last
month MailOnline reported on another 30 second clip which showed a 
Russian father taking his child's road safety to the extreme when he 
apparently fired a gun to force a driver to stop at a pedestrian 
crossing.

The taxi driver bumps into this silver car while attempting to park

Filmed from the dashboard of the car,
it shows a man dressed in a blue T-shirt and dark jeans holding the 
hand of a young boy as the driver approaches a pedestrian crossing.

As the car slows, the man can be seen holding what appears to be a gun in his hand which he apparently shoots twice.

The father then crosses the road with the young boy dressed in a red and white-striped top.

As he begins to flee the scene he collides with this dark-coloured 4x4
