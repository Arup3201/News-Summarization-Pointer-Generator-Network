It was an astonishing picture which shocked the world.

Waiting at 25,000ft, a long line of people are seen queuing as they bid to reach the top of Mount Everest.

Sadly, the picture was taken the day before the worst disaster on Everest for 16 years when four climbers died while descending from the packed summit.

Worried: Mr Dujmovits said he is horrified at inexperienced 'hobby climbers' who now attempt to climb the mountain. This photograph taken by Mr Dujmovits showing people queuing on the mountain shocked the world

Now, the man who took the image, Ralf Dujmovits, has spoken for the first time about what he saw over that fateful weekend.

The 50-year-old German - who is one of the most experienced mountaineers in the world - is horrified at inexperienced 'hobby climbers' who now attempt to climb the mountain.

Shockingly, he describes seeing an American man climbing to the top of the world's biggest mountain carrying his bicycle with him.

Speaking to The Guardian about the scene he photographed, Mr Dujmovits said: 'Watching them, I had a strong feeling that not all of them would come back, and I wrote as much in my internet diary.

'That leaves you with a really oppressive feeling that some of the people in the picture would soon be dead.'

Mr Dujmovits had reached the South Col of the mountain - at a height of just under 8,000 metres, when he decided to turn back because of the stormy conditions at the summit.

As he struggled to descent the mountain in treacherous conditions, he was left stunned to see the long queue of tourists slowly making their way up the mountain.

According to the mountaineer, who was attempting to climb Everest for the sixth time, there were 39 expeditions taking place at the same time involving more than 600 people.

He took the incredible images as he had never seen the feared mountain as crowded before. He described the weather prospects as being bad and the queues of people as appalling.

He has since been pleased by the response his picture has provoked, and hopes it will prevent inexperienced 'hobby climbers' from attempting Everest.

Casualties: German doctor Eberhard Schaaf, left, and Nepalese-Canadian 
Shriya Shah-Klorfine, right, were among those found dead on Mount Everest recently. According to a friend, 
Shah's last words were 'Save me'

He described being left horrified by what he witnessed on the mountain, with people attempting the climb when they should never have even been allowed anywhere near it.

This includes an: 'overweight French journalist – a small woman weighing around 80kg, who had used her entire supply of oxygen before she'd reached any height at all, and an American of Turkish origin who was carrying his bicycle with him because it had always been his dream to take it to the summit and insisted on fulfilling that dream at whatever cost'.

A similar tailback to the one pictured by Mr Dujmovits the previous day was partly blamed 
for the deaths of the four climbers from Germany, South Korea, China and 
Canada.

During their ascent, they became stuck in what Nepali 
mountaineering officials called a ‘traffic jam’ at the Hillary Step, a 
40ft spur of rock where temperatures are minus 20c and which is just 
180ft from the summit.

Many had to wait there for three hours
before making the final ascent, becoming cold, exhausted and using up 
vital oxygen supplies.
