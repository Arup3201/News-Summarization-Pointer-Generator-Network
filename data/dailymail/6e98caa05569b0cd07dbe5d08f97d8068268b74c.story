The Duke of Cambridge led the charge at a spectacular musical and theatrical tribute to Britain's armed forces during a special performance of Beating Retreat.

The annual display of military pomp and ceremony took on a special resonance this year, marking the 70th anniversary of D-Day and the centennial commemorations of the First World War.

Servicemen and women marked the sacrifices made by those who served in both wars by impressing the 6,500-strong crowd with a display of horsemanship, pageantry and gunfire last night.

Adorned in the black and gold trimmed uniform of the Irish Guards, of which he is a Royal Colonel, Prince William opened the ceremony by taking the salute.

At sunset fireworks sent streaks of green, silver and red sparks into the sky.

A procession of military musicians, each in the signature uniform of their battalion, performed a series of war-time anthems at the Horse Guards in Whitehall, central London.

The crowd saved one of their biggest cheers of the night for D-Day veteran Gordon Newton, who was shown on the big screen in the front row wearing his red beret and his medal adorning his chest.

He sang along as The Band of the Welsh Guards led a rendition of the First World War ballad 'It's a Long Way to Tipperary'.

Asked what he thought of the display, he said simply: 'Wonderful'.

British troops were joined by comrades from France and Canada, and William paid tribute to the work of Britain's close allies on the international stage.

He said: 'As Colonel of the Irish Guards I am delighted to support the Household Division Beating Retreat.

'Year after year this wonderful event showcases the skill and professionalism of our military musicians whilst reinforcing the traditions and heritage for which we as a nation are justifiably proud and envied the world over.

'As we begin our centenary commemorations of the First World War, I am particularly pleased to welcome our friends from Canada and France to Horse Guards Parade.

'Our linkage with both nations remain as strong as ever and continue to be reinforced through current military operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere.'
