Cork City full-back Brian Lenihan is being trailed by a number of English clubs with Crystal Palace and Hull City already making offers.

Cork manager John Caulfield has admitted that Republic of Ireland international Lenihan could leave the club within ‘the next couple of weeks’ after the 20-year-old impressed scouts.

‘A lot of teams have watched him, but it’s a business deal and it isn’t up to Cork City to name the clubs involved,’ Caulfield said. ‘Everyone knows who has watched him; Arsenal have, Hull have, we’ve realised that Manchester United have watched him, Tottenham, Everton and Villa have watched him.

‘They’ve all had direct club employees to look at him as opposed to some of the championship clubs, who’d have an agent saying he’s representing them.

‘The official situation is that we received two bids and both have been rejected. One of the clubs has come back to us and we’re in negotiations with them but there’s still quite a bit of work to do.

‘Do I think that he’ll be gone across channel in the next couple of weeks? I believe that he will, and we have to make sure that we get the proper deal and Brian does too.

‘What we have to try and do is a structured deal that if he plays international football or moves on elsewhere, we get rewarded. That’s probably what you have to look at.’

Head injury: The full-back was taken off with concussion during a 2-0 loss to Bohemian

Celtic are also understood to be one of the clubs keen but Cork want to strike a deal where the right-back can return on loan.

Having suffered concussion in a fall in a 2-0 loss at Bohemians last week, Lenihan is not available for Friday’s home clash against champions St Pat’s.

Hull are understood to have discussed a bid of £100,000 even though Crystal Palace have had an offer of £130,000 rejected.
