At least 21 people have been killed, with many of the victims believed to be children, after an asylum boat sank off the coast of Indonesia.

Another 25 have been recsued alive but there could be many more missing as witnesses report the boat was carrying as many as 100 Middle Eastern asylum seekers.

Warsono, a police official in West Java province, said 'Local people found 20 dead bodies floating in the water, most of them are children.'

Those already rescued were taken to an Islamic school in the West Java district of Cianjur before being transported to the Sukabumi immigration office for identification, said Cianjur Police Chief Lt. Col. Dedy Kusuma Bakti.

Some survivors told officials that more than 100 asylum seekers from Lebanon, Pakistan and Iraq were believed to be aboard the boat, but the exact number of passengers was not known, Bakti said.

Lebanon's official National News Agency said 17 Lebanese drowned in the incident. Nine members of a single family were among the Lebanese victims, with a woman and her eight children dying and her husband surviving, the agency reported.

Survivors said the boat was headed for Australia's Christmas Island.

The deaths are the first to happen while new Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in office as he travels to Indonesia to discuss the issue

The news comes just as Tony Abbott, Australia's new Prime Minister, travels to the developing nation in order to discuss his new policy of turning asylum ships back.

Mr Abbott sought to play down international tensions today, describing the matter as a 'passing irritant' in a radio interview.

However an email listing problems with Abbott's decision was accidentally made public by Indonesian officials, who are thought to be privately angered by the proposals.

Hundreds of asylum seekers use rickety boats to cross from Indonesia to Australia every year, often coming from the war-torn Middle East

Both Indonesia and Australia have claimed that any changes to the current situation would breach their country's sovereignty.

In the 24 hours before this accident, two other asylum boats were found travelling to Christmas Island carrying 71 asylum seekers between them

Australia navy officers are seeking permission to return 31 of the refugees to Indonesia.

Scores of people from war-torn countries use Indonesia as a transit point every year, boarding rickety fishing boats bound for Christmas Island, a tiny spit of land located 310 miles south of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
