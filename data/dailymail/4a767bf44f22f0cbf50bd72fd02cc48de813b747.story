A 97-year-old World War II veteran in Oklahoma faces a murder charge after authorities say he fatally shot his 30-year-old great granddaughter last week at the home the two shared.

When asked why he shot the woman, Russell Eugene Dawes told police that he 'got tired of her carrying on and I shot her,' according to an arrest report filed in Payne County District Court in central Oklahoma.

According to authorities, Dawes called a friend who owned a funeral home on Thursday morning and asked if he would pick up the body of his granddaughter, Sonja James, who had moved into his house to take care of him.

Rodger Floyd, the owner and director of the Davis Funeral Home in Cushing, told police he rushed to Dawes' home, where he confessed to him that he'd shot his granddaughter and asked him to remove the body from his house.

'I went up to him, I told him, anything I could do to help him, I'd be 
more than happy to help him. He thanked me and he told me to take good 
care of his granddaughter,' Floyd, who has known Dawes for nearly 30 years and has helped him make other funeral arrangements, told WPTV.

Floyd immediately called police to report an unattended death.
