Strictly speaking, their names weren’t on the guest list. There were no celebrated faces among them, and certainly no dignitaries or royalty. 

But yesterday, in a swathe that stretched nearly three miles through London, the ordinary people of  Middle England turned out in their tens of thousands for Margaret Hilda Thatcher.

There were dissenters, of course, but this was one day when the jeers were massively overwhelmed by the cheers.

In a quite remarkable tribute to the woman many describe as our greatest peacetime prime minister, they threw flowers, applauded … and remembered a leader who, as a Falklands veteran paratrooper perfectly summarised it: ‘Put the Great back in Great Britain.’ 

Three decades ago it might have been unimaginable that so many might turn out to pay their respects to the woman once dubbed a schoolchildren’s ‘milk snatcher’, a prime minister who stubbornly stuck to her principles in defiance of what others thought was right.

Yet this wasn’t a funeral to mirror the one afforded to Churchill in thanks for uniting the people; more an indication, perhaps, that hindsight had allowed so many to realise how much 11 years of Thatcherism might ultimately have shaped their lives for the better.

From the heart of the Palace of Westminster, but without Big Ben to signal 10am, up along Whitehall to Trafalgar Square, it was thick with hundreds, later thousands of men, women and children, prepared to witness even the briefest of moments in history as the cortege passed beneath Nelson’s watchful eye.

One middle-aged woman held up a placard. ‘Thank you Mrs Thatcher’ was all it said.

Indeed, by 10am there was hardly a square foot remaining on which to stand, nor a single piece of street furniture to climb on. 

They were seven to ten deep in places and shoulder to shoulder as far as you could see. Others opted for a view from the top of office blocks.

Expensive City suits stood alongside mothers with pushchairs; pensioners beside children and grandchildren who should probably have been at school. ‘Here she comes!’ someone shouted, and all eyes turned westward. 

By the time the cortege came into view the crowds were so tightly packed it was a struggle to catch even a glimpse of the procession, save for horses’ hooves and the too many pairs of highly polished military boots to count.

From somewhere behind the throng, an arm raised up to throw a white rose towards the coffin.

One group of veteran paratroopers who fought in the Falklands stood to attention and saluted. 

Former lance corporal Mark Bonar Jones, 51, recalled those who lost their lives in 1982 and told me: ‘She put the Great back in Great Britain at a time when it was desperately needed.’ 

Beside him Captain Bob Darby, 63, said of the protesters: ‘They have a right to protest. That’s democracy … and that was the reason we went to war when the islands were taken over by a fascist regime. 

‘If it wasn’t for Margaret Thatcher, they’d all be living under a different government now.’ 

An effigy of Baroness Thatcher in a noose was paraded through the streets and set ablaze in a former  mining village where there were beers rather than tears yesterday.

Ex-miners, led by Arthur Scargill’s former wife Anne, cheered as they staged the ‘alternative’ mock cremation in Goldthorpe, near Barnsley.

Villagers also let off fireworks in a deliberate snub to the dignified pageantry of the funeral service in St Paul’s Cathedral.

Mrs Scargill, 71, said: ‘We’ve waited a long time for this day here, and as you can see there’s a party atmosphere.

‘Thatcher – that woman – she decimated our communities. She starved our kids, there’s no jobs. She will never be forgiven.’

In London, outside St Paul’s, a minor scuffle involving 20 protesters broke out after mourners told them to ‘go away and have some respect’.

Much of the anger was directed at former Labour prime minister Tony Blair with anti-war activists shouting ‘Shame on you’, as he arrived with wife Cherie.

Scotland Yard chiefs were delighted that their multi-million-pound  security operation passed without a single arrest.
