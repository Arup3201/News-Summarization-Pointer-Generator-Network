Headteachers are warning that schools across Britain have been targeted in an alleged Islamist plot to take over classrooms.

The National Association of Head Teachers said it had ‘serious concerns’ about attempts to ‘alter the character’ of at least six schools.

It also warned that efforts to infiltrate classrooms were not limited to Birmingham and were likely to be affecting other major towns and cities.

Under investigation: Park View school, pictured above, is being investigated over the plot - which headteachers fear could spread

The Bradford Muslim Education Forum has run events involving alleged Birmingham plotter Tahir Alam, who heads the governing body at the city's Park View school

The union said ‘concerted efforts’ had been made to infiltrate state schools and run them according to strict Islamic principles.

While the body did not name the additional areas affected, there are concerns over schools in Bradford, Manchester and parts of East London, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Russell Hobby, NAHT general secretary, said some teachers were being appointed because of their Muslim faith rather than their skills.

Pupils at a school affected by the alleged plot freely praise terrorism, are segregated by gender, and are taught women must obey their husbands, it has been claimed.

Park View School in Birmingham allegedly failed to challenge the views of pupils who praised suicide bombers in the 9/11 and 7/7 atrocities.

Staff also taught that wives are ‘not allowed’ to refuse sex with their husbands, and that women belong in the kitchen, the Association of British Humanists said.

The organisation – which says it was told of the practices by former employees – also said girls were made to sit at the back of classes, and ignored when they tried to answer questions.

Park View denied the allegations, and said the idea it supports terrorism is ‘abhorrent’.

There was also evidence of ‘pressure’ being brought to bear on heads to adopt ‘certain philosophies and approaches’.

Speaking ahead of the union’s annual conference in Birmingham, he said: ‘We ourselves have concerns about what has been going on in and around half a dozen of those schools.

‘There have been things going on inside our schools which would make some of us feel uncomfortable.’

Meanwhile, it has been claimed that dozens of teachers pushed out of schools by an alleged Islamist takeover plot are too afraid to speak out because of gagging orders.

Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood said at least ten teachers told him they were made to sign agreements offering cash in return for their silence.

The latest allegation of the so-called ‘Trojan Horse’ plot – whereby Muslim extremists infiltrate state schools and run them according to Islamic principles – was made last night as Ofsted announced inspections at a further three schools, bringing the total to 21.

Birmingham City Council is also investigating 25 schools.

Mr Mahmood said: ‘A lot of people are still not speaking, even in private, because they are frightened of what may happen. They think if they come forward they will lose their pay-off or pensions and are worried they will then not be able to teach.’

Inquiry: Earlier this month, the names of 18 schools at the centre of the alleged plot were revealed in a list by Birmingham City Council. Above, one of the schools, Gracelands Nursery School in Sparkbrook

Lindsey Clark, former head of Park View, resigned this month after being reduced to a 'figurehead' with no real control over her school, a Department for Education probe found

Noshaba Hussain, a moderate Muslim former headmistress of Springfield Primary, was forced out of her job by a ‘well-organised and sinister’ group of extremists more than 20 years ago.

The 69-year-old told the Mail she was made to sign a confidentiality agreement, or ‘gag’, that threatened to withdraw her pay-off of a few months’ salary if she spoke to the press.

She claimed false rumours were spread about her by the Muslim governing body until she was sacked by Birmingham education chiefs for what was described as a ‘loss of faith and trust in the head by the governing body’.

‘It was all done through my union,’ she said. ‘I was told if I spoke to the press about what happened to me I would have to return the money.’

A source from one of the schools affected said: ‘A lot of teachers who leave are being bullied and harassed. The threat of taking away a reference can be worse than a monetary threat as they are worried their career will be affected.’
