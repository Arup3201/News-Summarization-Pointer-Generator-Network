A former FBI informant has revealed a fascinating career of two decades undercover with white supremacist and far right anti-government groups.

John Matthews, 59, told Newsweek he appeared as a troubled and paranoid Vietnam veteran who could not hold down a job, flat or marriage.

But in reality the Rhode Island native was posing as an extremist in a violent world and trying to help the FBI prevent far right terror attacks.

Mr Matthews, who always kept a backpack with provisions by his bedroom door, revealed all to his family when he developed a fatal lung condition.

‘These people are just plain crazy,’ he told Newsweek. ‘If they don’t like you, they (would) take you out to have you shot. They don’t care.

‘These people think that if they overthrew the government they’d make a better world,' he told Newsweek. 'Their world would be a total nightmare.’

He joined the U.S. Marines ‘to be like John Wayne’, going to Vietnam, and then working in various jobs - including as a Grand Canyon tour guide.

Mr Matthews also married and divorced four times. He first became interested in the dangers of the far right at a gun enthusiasts’ conference.

He became an FBI informant after tipping them off about the gun theft plans of the head of a paramilitary group he met at the conference, reported Newsweek.

Mr Matthews was soon attending Ku Klux Klan parties, selling weapons at petrol stations and hosting extremist leaders at home.

He once met a former Klan leader who allegedly laundered money, paid off authorities, bought stolen weapons and threatened to kill two FBI agents.

Since Barack Obama was elected U.S. President in 2008 the number of right-wing extremist groups has reportedly risen fivefold from 149 to 824.

Government officials warned of this rise in 2009 and said it was in part down to easier access to information online and America electing its first black President, reported Newsweek.

Last year nine members of Christian militia Hutaree allegedly tried to kill Michigan policemen, in just one of many recent far right terrorist attempts.

Jared Lee Loughner allegedly went on the rampage in Tucson, Arizona, in January, killing a judge and severely injuring Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.
