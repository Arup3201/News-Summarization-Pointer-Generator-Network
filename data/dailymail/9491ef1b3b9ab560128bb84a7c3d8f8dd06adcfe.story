Clutching his body in pain and engulfed by a haze of smoke, a commuter lies in the road after a bolt of lightning struck his umbrella in China.

Wen Kao, 29, was walking home from work in the city of Suzhou in eastern China's Jiangsu Province when the bolt of lightning struck, shredding his brolly and setting his clothes on fire.

Despite the fact that he was left in little more than rags with severe burns across his body, medics say he will miraculously live to tell the tale.

Agony: Wen Kao, 29, was walking home from work in the city of Suzhou in eastern China's Jiangsu Province when the bolt of lightning struck, shredding the brolly and setting his clothes on fire

Eye witness Wen Wang, 43, who took snaps of the man and his burnt clothing lying on the street, said that the lightning strike had happened in the middle of Typhoon Matmo, that blew roaring winds as well as thunder and lightning.

He said: 'With the wind he had no chance of putting his umbrella up, but he was carrying it under his arm when it was struck leaving him severe burns on the abdomen. To be honest I'm amazed he was even alive.'

Ferocious winds: The lightning strike had happened last Sunday during Typhoon Matmo, a ferocious storm that blew roaring winds as well as thunder and lightning. Umbrellas were next to no use - although Mr Wen will wish he hadn't taken his out at all

After being taken to the Suzhou Municipal Hospital's burn centre, the medic that treated him, Doctor Guo Yu-xi, said: 'In my 32 years of practice, I've only seen about five or six lightning strike victims survive.'

Guo added that the man will undergo surgery to repair damaged tissue once his condition is more stable and will remain under intensive care for up to 10 days to examine the extent of the damage caused to his internal organs.

He added: 'All the indications are however that he will survive although the recuperation process is likely to be a painful one.'
