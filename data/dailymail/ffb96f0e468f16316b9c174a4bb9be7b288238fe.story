Kevin Strootman is solely focusing on a return to full fitness with Roma and not dreaming of a future with Manchester United, according to the midfielder's agent.

The Dutchman, 24, has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford, where he would link up with former national team coach Louis van Gaal.

But Fabio Parisi says Strootman is working on recovering 100 per cent from a cruciate knee ligament injury, so the Serie A side can have a 'great player' at their disposal again.

'The healing of Kevin is good for him and for the team because they end up back with a great player,' he told Calcio Mercato. 'Now Kevin only has to stay focused to gain confidence and put minutes in the legs. 

'The future at Manchester United? Forget the rumours. We just think to 100% recover his condition.'

United signed Daley Blind in the summer to fill a defensive midfield slot, but have long cried out for a player with the physical stature of Strootman.

He played his first game this season in a 3-0 win over Torino in Serie A last weekend.
