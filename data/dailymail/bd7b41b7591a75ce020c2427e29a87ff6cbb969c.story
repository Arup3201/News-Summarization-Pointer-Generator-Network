A bouncer who beat and strangled his girlfriend to death before driving around for two days with her body stashed in the boot of a car has been jailed for life. Aaron Mann, 33, broke Claire O'Connor's jaw and two of her ribs before throttling her in the early hours of January 1 2012, after the couple had returned to the home they shared in Warwickshire following a New Year's Eve party.

Mann then dumped mother-of-four Ms O'Connor's body in her Ford Focus and drove it around for two days, before parking it outside his 
parents’ home and telling them what he had done.

The 38-year-old's body was found wrapped in a sleeping bag in the boot of her car on January 2 last year.

Mann told a court ‘voices in his head’ told him to kill his lover, and denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

But he was sentenced to life in prison today, after being found guilty of murder yesterday following a week-long trial.

Warwick Crown Court heard how he had previously sent his girlfriend chilling death threats; one which read 'You aint going to be around for long', and another that said simply 'I will kill you'.

Mann was told he must service a minimum of 16 years in court today.

His victim's heartbroken parents Graham and Patricia Griffiths said after the sentencing they had been in 'no doubt' that Mann was guilty of the 'savage and brutal murder of our daughter'.

'We would like to thank the jury, who have seen through the lies and deceit of Aaron Mann in his attempt to minimise his responsibility for the brutal murder of our daughter Claire,' the couple said in a statement issued through Warwickshire Police.

'His suggestion that “voices told him to do it”, were in our opinion completely fabricated.

'Claire had decided to split up from Mann, but she was murdered before she had a chance to leave him.

'We
have had to live with the terrible consequence of Mann’s murder of our 
daughter, the details of which have been both shocking and graphic.

'At
no stage has Mann shown any remorse whatsoever and his account of how 
he murdered Claire is quite the worst thing any parent could possibly 
imagine.

'At least we now know
that while he is in prison other parents can know that their daughters 
will not be exposed to this evil killer.'

Ms O'Connor's son Daniel wrote on Facebook following yesterday's verdict: 'It’s a result but don’t bring her back. Rot in hell!'

'Difficult': Bouncer Mann was convicted of murder and told he must serve at least 16 years in prison following a week-long trial

Detective Chief Inspector James Essex, from Warwickshire Police, said the force was pleased with the outcome of the trial.

'This has been a particularly difficult trial for Claire’s family and friends,' he said.

'Unfortunately domestic abuse is largely a hidden crime that all too often takes place behind closed doors. Often no one other than those directly involved, know it is taking place.

'Sadly it is too late for Claire, but I am urging anyone who suffers from domestic abuse, in whatever form, be it physical, psychological, sexual, financial or emotional, to seek help from the police or other support agencies.

'The message to anyone affected by domestic abuse is that you do not have to put up with the abuse and you don’t have to cope on your own.

'There are people who can help, people who can listen and who can provide you with support.'

The court heard throughout the trial how Mann was driven to jealousy after seeing Ms O'Connor socialising with other people, and she had told him their relationship was over.

Mark Wall QC, prosecuting, said the attack occurred on January 1 after the pair returned from a pub called the Green Bear, near their home in Nuneaton.

Mr Wall said: 'They returned home at around 12.30am and Mann killed Claire by applying such force to her neck as to asphyxiate her.

'A pathologist found other injuries as a result of the attack, including a broken jaw and two broken ribs.

'There can be no doubt that what Mann did was a significant attack, which was intended to either kill her or cause her very serious injury.'

Mr Wall added that the pair’s relationship 'had not run smooth' and that the previous spring Ms O'Connor had gone to the police to report violence and threats against her by Mann.

Giving evidence to the court himself, Mann - who had already admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility - demonstrated how he had gripped her neck and put a pillow over her face.

He added: 'The voices told me to finish her off'.

Prosecution psychiatrists dismissed Mann’s claims he had an acute psychotic illness - finding he had been perfectly 'rational' and careful in trying to cover his tracks.

Mann's medical records - which included frequent visits to doctors and psychiatrists since 2009 - had made no mention of hearing voices.
