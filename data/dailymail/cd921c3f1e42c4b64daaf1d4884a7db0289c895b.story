A first-born daughter of William and Kate will accede to the throne regardless of any male siblings under new plans which have been personally approved by the Queen.

For centuries the monarchy's rules have favoured male heirs ahead of any older sisters.

The current law of male primogeniture only allowed Elizabeth II to be Queen because she did not have any brothers.

Now the Queen has signalled that she supports calls made last week by David Cameron to change the system giving female heirs the same rights as their male siblings.

Mr Cameron has described the system as 'an anomaly' but requires the consent of all 15 commonwealth countries in order to change the law.

It would mean the Princess Royal leapfrogging over her younger brothers Princes Andrew and Edward to move from tenth to fourth in line to the throne.

The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is due to take place in Perth, Australia between the 28th and 30th of this month.

It coincides with Queen's 11-day Australian tour which will begin on Wednesday.

A royal aide told the Sunday Telegraph: 'The Queen will naturally leave politics and the deabting to her government, but she has let it be known that she would very much welcome an active debate on the issue by all her commonwealth leaders.'

Referring to the possibility of Kate becoming pregnant Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, warned that the 'clock is ticking'.

In an interview following the announcement of their engagement, William said of their plans: 'Obviously we want a family so we’ll have to start thinking about that.'

As the law stands, if William and Kate have a girl followed by a boy, their son will become king. But if they have daughters only, the eldest will become queen.

As well as the unanimous consent of 
the 15 Commonwealth countries the reforms would require a repeal or 
ammendment to the Coronation Oath act of 1688, the Bill of Rights 1688, 
the Act of settlement 1701 and the Royal Marriagers Act 1772.

The 1701 Act was brought in following
the Glorious Revolution – when a Dutch invasion helped overthrow a 
Papist king – so that a Catholic could never sit on our throne again.

The Prime Minister is also hoping to 
repeal the ban on the monarch being married to a Roman Catholic however
the King or Queen, as Supreme Governor of the Church of England would 
have to remain protestant.

Mr Cameron wrote: 'This rule is a 
historical anomaly, it des not, for example, bar those who marry spouses
of other faiths and we do not think it can copntinue to be justified.'

Earlier this month the Sovereign Grant Bill, which will revolutionise the way the Royal Family is funded was passed by the House of Lords.

It means that if William and Kate's firstborn is a girl she will become the first female to be allowed to inherit the £700million Duchy of Cornwall estate.

Earlier this year Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg who is in charge of constitutional change and is known to favour reform, stepped up contacts with other Commonwealth countries.

He said: ‘My own personal view is that in this day and age the idea that only a man should ascend to the throne I think would strike most people as a little old-fashioned.'

Franz, Duke of Bavaria, could have ended up on the British throne

Had an 18th Century law not been passed by Parliament, Britain's monarchy throughout the last 300 years would have had a very different cast of characters.

For starters, rather than becoming one of the most recognisable faces in the world, our present Queen would have spent her life as a minor princess in some German backwater.

And instead of pledging allegiance to Elizabeth II, loyal British subjects would now be singing God Save Our Gracious King to... Francis II of Bavaria.

The 1701 Act Of Settlement passed the
crown to Electress Sophia of Hanover and her Protestant descendants - 
and banned all Roman Catholics from ever ascending the throne.

That
law - and the centuries-old practice of male primogeniture, in which a 
male child automatically leapfrogs over his older sisters - has largely 
dictated who became King or Queen of Britain for centuries.  

But
according to historian Ian Lloyd writing in the Sunday Times, Francis 
II would now be ruling Brittania had these ancient laws not been 
adopted.

Franz, Duke of
Bavaria, is a distant cousin of the Queen and head of the House of 
Wittelsbach, Bavaria's ruling family. He is the senior co-heir-general 
of King Charles I and therefore regarded as the rightful heir to the 
House of Stuart, which ruled England from 1567 to 1707. From
birth Franz was recognised by the Jacobites as a Prince of England, 
Scotland, France and Ireland, Prince of Cornwall and Rothesay.

The Duke's great-grandfather was the last king of Bavaria before being deposed at the end of World War One in 1918.

During
World War Two, the Dukes' family condemned the Nazi regime and fled to 
Hungary.  When Hitler's stormtroopers marched into Budapest in 1944, the
Royal Family was arrested and detained in a number of concentration 
camps.

Following 
liberation in 1945, Franz, studied business management at the University
of Munich. Now 78, he still lives in an apartment in the city and is a 
keen collector of modern art.
