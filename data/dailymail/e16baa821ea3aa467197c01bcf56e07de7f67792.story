Germany's players won't be feeling the heat ahead of their quarter final tie with France - their dressing room preparations will provide quite the opposite effect, in fact.

Each German player has been providing with a bowl of ice by their peg in the changing rooms at the Estadio Castelao, leaving Mesut Ozil and co to cool off pre match.

While Rio de Janeiro is experiencing temperatures of 29 degrees - not enough to force cooling breaks during the game - the players will be as cold as ice in their confines.

But Arsenal's Per Mertesacker might find it a little bit frosty - he has been dropped from the starting line up despite boasting the experience of 102 caps.

Miroslav Klose starts up front as he looks to score his 16th World Cup goal and move past Ronaldo to the summit of the all-time top scorer rankings.
