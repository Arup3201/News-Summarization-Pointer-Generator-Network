When his father died in March after a long struggle with Parkinson’s disease, David Dean felt as if his world had ended.

The former factory worker had sacrificed his job and much of his free time to spend three years caring for his father, and didn’t know how to get his life back on track.

But now Mr Dean, 56, from Lincolnshire, says he has finally had his spirits lifted after winning the Daily Mail’s Dream Cottage Competition.

This beautiful 17th century thatched cottage, in Suffolk, has been won by Daily Mail reader David Dean, from Lincolnshire

He said he was ‘in absolute shock’ when 
he received the call telling him he had won the 17th century cottage 
worth £340,000 in Suffolk.

He added: ‘I’m overwhelmed. At first I thought it was one of my friends pulling my leg.

‘If you believe in fate, this is certainly it. I feel it’s my reward for the difficult time I’ve had.

‘It has been a tough few years watching my father’s health slowly deteriorate, but this is some light at the end of the tunnel for me. It came at just the right time.’

Mr Dean, who before now had never owned his own home, described the picturesque cottage dating from 1655 as ‘something from a Christmas card’.

It has three bedrooms, all its original beams and fireplaces as well as a summer house and hot tub in the garden – vastly different from the small 1960s semi-detached house in Lincolnshire where he lived with his father.

The cottage, appropriately named The Retreat, has a pretty garden with a rockery,  a partly walled terrace and a rose archway – a spot where Mr Dean can enjoy summer barbecues with his five brothers.
