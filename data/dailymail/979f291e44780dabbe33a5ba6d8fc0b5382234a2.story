Ashley Samuel, 18, and Yahya Ahmed and Mohamed Sayid, both 19, used a taxi company to drop them off near their targets - and paid the unknowing getaway drivers to wait.

The gang stole a total of £27,700 during nine robberies between April and July last year, hitting one City Slots Amusements in Ilford, north London store three times. 

The trio pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob at Snaresbrook Crown Court on 5 December and were jailed yesterday for eight years and four months each.

A court heard the gang, of Ilford, north London, threatened arcade staff with kitchen knives and a sharpened screwdriver in front of horrified customers.

Some victims were tied up with duct tape to stop them escaping or getting help, while another was forced at knifepoint to open the company's safe.

In one raid, Sayid repeatedly tried to stab a 28-year-old  employee in the chest with the sharpened screwdriver, despite the victim complying with the group's every demand.

The victim managed to block the attack with his hands during the robbery, which took place at Cashino in East Ham, on 30 May 2014.

In his victim impact statement, the man said: 'During this robbery I feared for my life like I have never feared before. All I could see in front of my face was my baby boy's face.

'He is only four months old and I am here to protect him and look after him throughout his life. I feared my life was about to end with me being stabbed to death during this robbery.  

He added: 'The three suspects that committed this robbery got the key for the safe but continued attacking me and tried to stab me. They did not care about my life.

'This robbery has left me feeling a very nervous man and I am not sure if I will ever get over it.'

The court heard many of the employees threatened were left traumatised and depressed after their ordeals

City Slots Amusements on High Road, Ilford, was raided on April 7 last year, then again on May 8 and for a third time on July 16.

After the robberies, the group returned to the taxi to make their getaway, with cash stashed in holdalls. 

Their crime spree ended when they were arrested on July 17 by Flying Squad detectives on the way back from a robbery.

DC Brad Weston, of the Flying Squad, said: 'These men were brutal and violent in their pursuit of money. One of the victims narrowly escaped being stabbed.

'Fortunately, none of the victims were seriously injured, although they have all suffered the mental and emotional after-effects of their horrendous experience.

'Many of the victims are suffering from flashbacks or depression and finding it very hard to return to any kind of normal life.'
