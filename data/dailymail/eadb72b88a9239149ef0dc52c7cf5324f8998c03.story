Fashion brand American Apparel was last night attacked for an ‘abhorrent’ advertising campaign featuring provocative images of models posing as schoolgirls.

One advert for a miniskirt from its Back to School range was labelled ‘underage pornography’.

In the photo a model is seen from behind, bending over with her legs and part of her buttocks and underwear on display.

The company also sells a range of crop tops called ‘Lolita’, a reference to the controversial novel by Vladimir Nabokov about an older man’s sexual infatuation with a 12-year-old girl.

The American Apparel website, which is aimed at young people, sells a collection of clothing and accessories under the heading School Days. It features the tagline: ‘Your first assignment is to dress accordingly.’

Pictures show models in thigh-skimming skirts and midriff-revealing tops standing beside school lockers.

Yesterday, a children’s charity called the advertising disgraceful and asked parents to stop their children from buying the items. 

Peter Bradley, from Kidscape, said: ‘It’s something we find abhorrent. It’s about using underage pornography to sell products and the sexualisation of children, which cannot ever be justified.

‘A School Days campaign is aimed at children under the age of 16.

‘Would the company’s board members let their daughters wear these miniskirts?’

Mr Bradley added: ‘I would like to see parents not allow their daughters to buy such clothes.’

'Underage porn': On Instagram, one girl, using the handle 'wordjamming', wrote: 'Never thought @americanappareluk would need to resort to porn to sell. Underage porn nonetheless. Shameless'

Outraged: Meanwhile, another, dubbed 'aislingkie', declared: 'Objectifying much @americanappareluk

Another advert: American Apparel has recently released its 'Back to School' lookbook, featuring a range of models posing in school settings. Above, two girls pose in front of lockers while wearing leather skirts

Of the image looking up a model’s skirt, he said: ‘It’s a provocative photograph, verging on soft porn. How can it in any way be connected with “School Days”?’

The Back to School photograph, which was posted on the brand’s UK Instagram account, has now been taken down.

Similar images that appeared on the company’s website also appear to have been removed.

As well as the tartan tennis skirt they advertised, the collection features a range of items that are inappropriate for school wear, including crop tops, nail polish, high heels and a leather miniskirt.

Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, who is chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on body image, said: ‘The images used by American Apparel are completely inappropriate, especially when used under the strap line of School Days. 

'The images serve only to objectify and sexualise women and I feel American Apparel are being extremely irresponsible with their desire to be “controversial”.’

'Inappropriate for school': Twitter user Sarah Redington said: 'American Apparel with these 'back to school' basics. At what high school do those clothes pass dress code? Not mine'

Students: This photo from the campaign features three models dressed in short skirts and long white socks

Controversial: On August 5, American Apparel posted a tweet advertising a miniskirt named 'Lolita Mini'

Critics of the campaign were quick to express their disgust at the photograph on social media.

Many deemed it sexist and said it objectified women. One Twitter user wrote: ‘American Apparel – their “back to school” skirts fuelling Lolita fantasies and rampant sexism aplenty.’

Simon Revington said: ‘The @americanapparel Back to School campaign is in poor taste. It’s borderline softcore porn. Clumsy concept sends wrong msg.’

Another Twitter user tweeted: ‘American Apparel’s latest advert is horrendous.

‘I understand “sex sells” but not when it’s “back to school”. Who on earth came up with that?!’

One female Instagram user said: ‘Never thought @americanappareluk would need to resort to porn to sell. Underage porn nonetheless. Shameless.’

It is the latest upset to hit the fashionable clothing company after its founder Dov Charney was sacked in June amid a flurry of scandals.

And this is not the first time it has faced controversy over its unusual advertising.

In March, it met with a storm of criticism for an advert published in a magazine that featured a topless ex-Muslim model with the words ‘Made in Bangladesh’ printed across her chest.

Last year, the retailer was labelled ‘sexist’ and ‘sleazy’ for advertising a unisex shirt using half-naked women alongside a group of fully clothed male models.

The business now has 10,000 employees and 249 stores in 20 countries, including the US and the UK. American Apparel did not respond to requests for comment last night.

Last month, it emerged that the founder of American Apparel has been rehired as a 'strategic consultant'.

Dov Charney, 45, was sacked in June with the board citing his alleged misuse of company funds and role in disseminating nude photos of
 an ex-employee who filed a case against him in 2011.

But just three weeks after he was forced out, he was taken back on as a paid consultant - on the same large salary of $832,000.

In a statement, American Apparel said the Canadian businessman, who founded the company when he was 20, would serve in the role until the end of an investigation into the claims against him.

It added: 'Based on the findings of the investigation, the committee
 will determine if it is appropriate for Mr. Charney to serve as CEO or 
an officer or employee of American Apparel.'

The former employee at the centre of the allegations sued Mr Charney in 2011 for $260 million after she claimed he forced her to be his 'sex slave.'

The case was thrown out in 2012 but the alleged victim was then subject to an online campaign to discredit her. Mr Charney is facing claims he allowed a member of staff to impersonate and post naked photos online of the former employee.
