A convoy of vehicles carrying 'dummy' obese women could be used to help smuggle Baby P's mother out of prison, it emerged today.

Tracey Connelly, who has ballooned to 22st in a Durham jail, was this week granted parole despite allowing her boyfriend and his paedophile brother to torture to death her son Peter.

After five years behind bars, prison and probation bosses are likely to use subterfuge to stop the 32-year-old being photographed, traced and attacked by vigilantes when she leaves 'within days'.

Connelly has gained at least a stone for every year she has been in jail, having previously admitted 'I put on a lot of weight when I came to prison' by gorging on pizza and jam tarts in solitary confinement.

Sources have said a plan is in place to hide Connelly inside a car within the prison walls before being swept to a secret location to start a new life.

Meanwhile extra vehicles containing women of a similar weight with their faces covered could also be used to throw anyone keen to follow her off the scent.

The same ploy was used when the girlfriend of Soham murderer Maxine Carr left prison.

In
 2004, when Carr left Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire, she was stowed 
in the footwell of a car at the same time as several similar vehicles also left.

'It
 will be difficult to get her out without being seen, but there are ways
 and means,' a Probation Service source told the Daily Mirror.

'She
 may not be freed straight away, but when she is, they will use tactics 
to ensure she is not photographed, just as they did with Maxine Carr.'

Connelly will also be given detailed 
advice on how to hide who she is when she leaves jail in the coming days
 to avoid being found.

She will leave Low Newton jail near Durham for a
 parole hostel to start her reintegration back into society.

She is already said to look markedly different from her notorious mugshot, having put on weight while in prison.

But
 probation officers will also advise her to change her name by deed 
poll, change the colour of her hair and have it cut differently.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'The release of life and other indeterminate sentence prisoners is directed by the independent Parole Board once they are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community.

'The IPP licence lasts for a minimum of 10 years, and an offender on an IPP licence may be recalled to prison at any time for breaching their licence conditions. Additionally, they will be subject to strict controls and restrictions for as long as their risk requires them.'

After
 just five years in jail experts believe she poses ‘no danger to the 
public’, despite committing a crime that horrified Britain.

Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing 
nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend 
Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen.

Peter was just 
17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his 
mother’s flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 separate 
injuries, including a broken back.

The case provoked a national 
scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a
 series of warning signs that could have saved the child’s life.

boyfriend Steven Barker (left) and his paedophile brother Jason Owen

Sickened
 by the depravity, 132,000 people joined ‘hate groups’ on social 
networking internet sites calling for Connelly, Barker and Owen to ‘burn
 in hell’.

Some threatened to violently attack them when they are eventually released.

Despite widespread horror at her imminent release, ministers have 
decided she should not be granted lifetime anonymity and round-the-clock
 police protection.

Anonymity orders are rare and only four are currently in force.

These
 apply to child killer Mary Bell, James Bulger’s murderers Robert 
Thompson and Jon Venables and to Maxine Carr, who provided a false alibi
 for Soham murderer Ian Huntley.
