Barack Obama last night blamed right-wing Republicans for the political gridlock which has paralysed Washington - and suggested that many congressmen were too scared of Rush Limbaugh to compromise with their rivals.

Speaking to an audience of super-rich Democrats including Justin Timberlake, the President said he thought his re-election would 'break the fever' of partisanship, but admitted that he was still unable to carry out his agenda.

However, Mr Obama said he hoped to capitalise on the spirit of co-operation seen following recent disasters to make progress on political issues such as immigration reform.

Villain? Mr Obama said many Republican politicians were scared of Mr Limbaugh's influence

The President, currently under pressure over issues such as Benghazi and the IRS, addressed three Democratic fund-raising events in New York City last night.

At a dinner party for 60 donors at the West Village home of producer Harvey Weinstein, Mr Obama revealed how he had been repeatedly frustrated in his attempts to find common ground with Republicans in Congress.

'What's blocking us right now is sort of hyper-partisanship in Washington that, frankly, I was hoping to overcome in 2008,' he said. 'And in the midst of crisis, I think the other party reacted, rather than saying now is the time for us all to join together, decided to take a different path.

'My thinking was after we beat them in 2012, well, that might break the fever, and it's not quite broken yet.

'But I am persistent. And I am staying at it. And I genuinely believe that there are actually Republicans out there who would like to work with us but they're fearful of their base and they're concerned about what Rush Limbaugh might say about them.'

Mr Limbaugh, one of the country's leading radio DJs, is believed to be highly influential within the GOP, and has been known to target Republican politicians who he believes are insufficiently conservative.

The President told guests, who had paid up to $20,000 each to attend, that recent tragedies had helped bring people together and break down political barriers.

'What I will be striving for over the next three-and-a-half years is to see if that spirit we saw in Boston and West, Texas, if we can institutionalise that,' Mr Obama said. 'If we can create a framework where everybodyâ€™s working together and moving this country forward.'

At a second intimate event nearby, the President said he expected a deal on immigration to come at some point this year, and added he believed that there was still a chance to secure peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

A third fundraiser, for the House and Senate Democratic campaign committees, was held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and is expected to raise up to $4.5million for next year's congressional election campaign.

The party has also not yet paid off all its debts from the general elections last year.

Mr Obama has committed himself to a relatively heavy schedule of campaigning for the 2014 mid-terms, as he believes his political legacy is dependent on ensuring a sympathetic hearing from a Democratic-controlled Congress.
