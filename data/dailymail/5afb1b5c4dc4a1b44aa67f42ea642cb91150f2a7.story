An Alabama woman shot and killed a young man when he tried to break into her home, saying his car had broke down.

Mikel Steven Smith, 18, was reportedly armed with a knife when he tried to break into a home located in the Booth community, close to Prattville, WSFA reports.

'He knocked on the door and tried to gain entrance by saying he needed help that he was broke down,' Autauga County Chief Deputy Joe Sedinger told the station.

The woman was knocked to the floor as Smith tried to force his way inside, sheriff's records reportedly show.

'The lady went to the door with her gun in her hand, because it was after midnight,' Sedinger told The Montgomery Advertiser.

Authorities have not released the address where the attempted break-in reportedly took place but did say it occurred in the 1600 block of the Booth community in Prattville

Sedinger told the station that the female homeowner feared for both her safety and for that of her 22-year-old niece when she fired multiple shots at Smith.

Smith's body was found about 30 feet away from the home, and he was pronounced dead shortly after 12:30am, WSFA adds.

The woman is unlikely to face charges, Sedinger said.

James Bryan Vance, pictured, was arrested and charged with first-degree robbery in connection with the attempted break-in and is currently held on $15,000 bond

'Everything in our investigation shows this lady was inside her home when the man forced his way in through a door,' he told The Montgomery Advertiser.

He added, 'Once the investigation is completed it will be presented to a future session of the grand jury for review.'

'Itâ€™s her right to protect her home and family and thatâ€™s what our investigation shows she did.'

Investigators believe another person was involved in the attempted break-in.

James Bryan Vance, 32, was taken into custody and charged with first-degree robbery in connection to the case. He is currently held on a $15,000 bond.

Sedinger told WSFA that the suspects are not related and that there does not seem to be a connection between the intruder and the homeowner.
