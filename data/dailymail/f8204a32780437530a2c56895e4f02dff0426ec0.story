If you've a Batman fan in your life and you don't know what to buy them for Christmas, it would be hard to do better than this: a life-size, fully-functional Batmobile.

Costing £90,000, which is considerably less than the £2.3million paid for the original TV Batmobile earlier this year, this replica with a straight six, fuel-injected modern Jaguar 3.2 litre engine with automatic transmission is practically a bargain.

The jet black machine with functional flame-thrower at the back is based on the Batmobile driven by Michael Keaton’s caped crusader in the 1989 blockbuster, and will be one of the star lots when it goes up for auction in Weybridge, Surrey, at the end of the month.

The Batmobile replica comes complete with flame-thrower and is expected to sell for £90,000 at auction 

The road-legal car has its own flame-thrower and hydraulic suspension that can raise it nine inches

Impressive spoilers: This Batmobile was inspired by the car in the 1989 Batman film directed by Tim Burton

Built in the UK on custom chassis, the rear-wheel drive Batmobile comes complete with a fully operational flame thrower and hydraulic suspension which can raise the car by a further nine inches.

It is claimed the car will hit 60mph in less than five seconds, although the visibility has been compared to that of a fighter jet.

The replica, which took a year to build, was inspired by the 1989 Batman rather than the recent Christopher Nolan trilogy.

In the film, Bruce Wayne’s alter-ego goes up against Jack Nicholson’s Joker character, who wreaks havoc on the people of Gotham City.

The car will go up for sale at the Historics car auction on 30 November, and is expected to sell for between £70,000 and £90,000.

Edward Bridger-Stille, from Historics, said: 'The car is like a dream for any Batman fan. It brings traffic to a standstill with people wanting to be photographed by it.

Where do you put your latte? The car is fully roadworthy, although it might be a squeeze in the supermarket car park

The car that is up for sale is a replica of this one in the 1989 film starring Michael Keaton and Kim Basinger

The Batmobile has gleaming black paint, extravagantly authentic spoilers, and even a working flame-thrower

The car goes from 0-60 in under five seconds, but its visibility has been compared to that of a fighter jet

'It is a smooth-driving car, however there’s not a lot of all-round vision - it’s a bit like a fighter jet in that sense.

'But it also quite quick thanks to its lightweight fibreglass body, and should be capable of 0-60mph in less than five seconds.

'This vehicle is believed to be one of the best after-production, fully road-legal models ever made.'

Holy roadblocks! The astonishing-looking car is fully legal to drive on the road, and is pretty nippy, too

Batman fan John Priestley, 45, takes the Batmobile for a spin - it will be sold at auction on 30 November
