France's far-right National Front 'is at the gates of power', the country's Socialist Prime Minister has admitted.

Manuel Valls made the admission as a political and economic crisis continued to envelop his failing administration.

Unemployment is at a record 3.4 million, the economy has stagnated, and President Francois Hollande has been portrayed as a hypocritical left-winger by the former first lady he cheated on.

Poll shock: President Francois Hollande has been warned that National Front leader Marine Le Pen could beat him in France's 2017 presidential elections

Now an opinion poll reveals that the humiliated Mr Hollande is likely to be beaten by National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen in the 2017 presidential elections.

'We have to act differently,' said Mr Valls, during a meeting in Italy on Sunday. 'We have to speak differently. In order to be listened to and to be heard.

'We know what will be the terrible price of failure. In France, the extreme right of Marine Le Pen is at the gates of power.

'And I, as a man of the left, will never be able to resign myself to that because it will be the weakest who will be the first to suffer. And it will also be a terrible, perhaps fatal, blow to Europe.'

The crisis within the Socialist Party led to another emergency reshuffle last month, meaning there have been three governments this year alone.

Last week, former first lady Valerie Trierweiler produced a devastating memoir in which she portrayed Hollande as an egotistical chancer lacking in principles.

The FN, meanwhile, enjoyed spectacular electoral success at European and local elections in May, and are now widely viewed as the most popular party in France.

Ms Le Pen's father, the convicted racist and anti-Semite Jean-Marie Le Pen, came second in the presidential elections of 2002, and Ms Le Pen believes she can go a step further.

Her party's agenda is fiercely anti-Europe and anti-immigration, and has become increasingly popular as the French economy collapses.

Far-right groups have protested in Calais about the number of migrants who have congregated in the port town as they try to smuggle themselves into Britain, above

Far-right groups rallied in Calais on Sunday to protest about the number of UK-bound migrants congregating in the port town.

Mr Valls's government faces a confidence vote in parliament on September 16th, when Socialist rebels could side with the opposition and force its dissolution.

Mr Valls said: 'Everyone has to step up and accept the responsibility of avoiding an institutional crisis.

'When Marine Le Pen is forecast to get 32 per cent in the first round of a presidential vote and even win in the second, is that what we need? Or do we need to put the country back on its feet?'
