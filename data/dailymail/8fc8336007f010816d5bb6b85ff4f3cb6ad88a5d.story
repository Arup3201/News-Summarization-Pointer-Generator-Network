A former billionaire hedge-fund manager who is supposed to be doing eleven years of hard time after he was busted for insider trading in 2009 is still living the good life as he sits in the medical unit at the federal clink in Aver, Massachusetts, according to a prison snitch.

For Raj Rajartnam, hard time includes private toilets, a shared balcony where inmates can sun themselves, televisions and adjustable beds.

Additionally, Rajartnam has his very own 'manservant.'

Living the life: Wall Street thief Raj Rajaratnam (left) reportedly has things pretty good in his life behind bars

'He’s doing his time in the lap of luxury compared to the other inmates,' the source told the New York Post.

Rajaratnam founded the Galeon Group - a New York-based hedge-fund management firm - and quickly became one of the richest men in America. In 2009, Forbes ranked him as the 236th richest man in America.

On October 16, 2009, FBI agents arrested Rajartnam on allegations of insider trading that U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara estimates was worth about $60 million - 'the largest hedge-fund insider trading case in United States history.'

Rajartnam was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in prison. He's serving his time at the Federal Medical Center Devens, where the source claims 'he's reigning like a king.'

Manservant: Rajaratnam has reportedly recruited a 'manservant' to things like make his meals for him

The source told the Post that Rajartnam is in Unit P3, which is on the top floor of the hospital ward and is usually designated for the most seriously ill inmates - the same unit housed geriatric mobster John 'Sonny' Franzese, who is  96 years old and in failing health.

According to the source, Rajartnam 'has a very delightful guy doing all sorts of stuff for him - sort of 
like a ‘manservant.’

The manservant is described as a 'gentle giant' American Samoan named Eddie. Eddie's primary job in the P3 unit is to push prisoners in wheelchairs around the prison. He got that job and was moved the medical unit after befriending Rajartnam.

'He became enamored of Raj, and Raj started talking about how much he once paid his chauffeurs. Now Eddie wants to be Raj’s driver when he gets out,' the insider said.

The source said Eddie often cooks for Rajaratnam in a nearby microwave so the Wall Street crook doesn't have to walk all the way down the hall.

Diabetes: a prison source says Rajaratnam is getting special treatment and should be in the prison's general population

The source said that other inmates who are much older and sicker than Rajaratnam are held in parts of the prison that are a half-mile from the hospital and chow hall.

According to the source, Rajaratnam should be housed in general population in Building H, but he's getting 'special treatment' and is allowed to live in the medical ward. In Building H, there are two prisoners to each cell, a communal bathroom - and no manservants. 

At sentencing, Rajaratnam's attorneys argued that he should get a more lenient sentence because he is extremely ill with diabetes and might need a kidney transplant - a risk that anyone with diabetes runs.

'Big deal,' the source said about the diabetes claim. 'Up there, diabetes is like a common cold.'

He adds that Rajaratnam gets around the prison just fine and actually has lost weight.
