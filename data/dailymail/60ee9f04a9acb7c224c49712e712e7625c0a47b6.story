The EU has attacked Britain over its pioneering food 'traffic light' system

British efforts to combat the swelling obesity epidemic have been torpedoed by meddling Eurocrats.

The EU has attacked Britain over its pioneering food 'traffic light' system, in a case that could end up in the European courts.

The system is designed to help parents and consumers make healthy choices, by labelling food items red, green or orange according to their fat, salt and sugar contents.

Health professionals are losing the battle in the war against obesity. Six in ten British adults and one in three children are now obese.

The European Commission opened infraction proceedings against Britain in February after Mediterranean countries complained that the system would damage the sales of their high fat exports such as Nutella, olive oils, salamis and cheeses.

Brussels said the scheme could be 'discriminatory' because it 'discourages certain purchases, penalises industry and distorts the functioning of the internal market.'

Spokesman Miguel Sagredo said the European Commission has sent a letter of formal notice to Britain that requires a reply within two months.

Sagredo said: 'The commission will seek information from the UK authorities on how this system will negatively affect the marketing of several products. '

'The concern that we have is that the system is likely to make the marketing of some products more difficult and therefore hinder or impede trade between EU countries.' The 'simplistic' character of the traffic light system might in certain instances create misconceptions among consumers, he said.

Italy says it stood to lose 6-700million euros a year in sales in the traffic light system .

National farmers association Coldiretti claims the scheme fails to distinguish between junk food and traditional products with high fat that are part of a balanced healthy Mediterranean diet. It said : 'The aim of the traffic-light system is to reduce the consumption of fat, salt and sugar, but it's based only on the presence of certain substances, rather than on the actual quantities that are consumed,' said in statement.

'Paradoxically, this ends up excluding things like extra-virgin olive oil from diets, while promoting sugar-free fizzy drinks, misleading consumers about the real nutritional value (of the items)'.

But the scheme, which is voluntary and fully legally compliant with EU food law, has been praised in other quarters, with BEUC, the European Consumers' Organisation, calling for it to be extended throughout the EU. 

The World Cancer Research Fund today defended the UK’s ‘traffic light’ food labelling system.

In a statement it said: 'World Cancer Research Fund UK was instrumental in lobbying for a food labelling system to help consumers understand the nutritional content of food products.

'In the UK, where obesity linked to poor diet is an important public health issue, the traffic light system means consumers can make informed choices about the food they eat.

'World Cancer Research Fund UK believes that the simple red, amber and green guide helps consumers make informed food and drink choices and so reduce their cancer risk.

'A consistent front-of-pack labelling system was something WCRF UK sought as part of the wider fight against rising rates of obesity.'
