A photograph of a mother breastfeeding her 16-month-old son in the bath was flagged to Facebook because it apparently violated the company's policy on nudity.

Kaya Wright said she was 'disappointed' when she was sent a notification by the social networking site to say the image was being 'reviewed'. 

The message came even though Mrs Wright, who works as a nurse, posted the picture on a closed page for a group of breastfeeding mothers.

Reported: Kaya Wright, pictured with sons Daniel, five, and 16-month-old Kayden. The 32-year-old said she was 'disappointed' when she was sent a notification by Facebook to say her photo was being 'reviewed'

The decision prompted other members of the group, Liverpool Community BAMBIS (Babies and Mums Breastfeeding Information and Support), to upload their own breastfeeding photographs in a show of solidarity with Mrs Wright.

Another mother on the group described the reporting of breastfeeding images as 'common'. 

Mrs Wright, who works as a nurse, told the Liverpool Echo: 'At first I thought it was a joke. Facebook said the image had been reported for nudity but you really couldn't see anything. 

'Then I was a bit disappointed at the thought that someone in the group had reported the image.' 

'It's a breastfeeding group, so what do you expect? Some of my friends thought that maybe it had been reported by mistake.' 

'Violation': Mrs Wright, who works as a nurse, posted this photo of herself breastfeeding Kayden on a members-only group. Other women came out in solidarity with Mrs Wright, posting their own images

Notification: Clare Riley, left with her five-month-old daughter Imogen, was told this photo, right, was being reviewed by Facebook's community team after being reported for violating their standards on nudity

BAMBIS works with Liverpool Women's Hospital and in local children's centres to encourage breastfeeding. 

When Mrs Wright, 32, told the group what had happened, dozens of other mothers started to post their own breastfeeding photographs. 

Mrs Wright, who also has a five-year-old son, Daniel, added: 'I tried to breastfeed Daniel but it didn't work out. But it was completely different with Kayden. 

'Breastfeeding is amazing, everyone should try it. But in this country I've noticed there is a different attitude to breastfeeding. 

'Ever since Kayden was born, people have kept asking me when are you going to bottle feed.

Facebook has come under fire on a number of occasions over its strict policy on nudity.

Up until last summer, the guidelines - designed to stop users sharing pornographic images and explicit photos of minors - also included a complete ban on photos of mothers breastfeeding, deeming them 'inappropriate'. 

The policy, which can be viewed online, now states that the company 'aspires' to allow users to share photographs of personal importance, such as those of a mother breastfeeding her child. 

Despite this, some mothers still report that their breastfeeding photographs are flagged up to Facebook by other users.

There have also been complaints by parents posting innocent photographs of their children in swimsuits - with the social networking site claiming they breach the rules.

'Breastfeeding is hard and it's made ever harder by other people's perceptions. I think breastfeeding should be taught in schools to raise more awareness. 

Later, Facebook contacted Mrs Wright to say they would not be removing the picture as it did not violate their rules on nudity.

One member of the group described the issue surrounding breastfeeding images as 'common', and said that an image she posted had also been reported by another user. 

Clare Riley, 39, posted a photograph of herself breastfeeding her five-month-old daughter Imogen on another group for new mothers - but said it was reported to Facebook in less than 12 hours.

The mother-of-three said she was 'sick' and 'disgusted' when she received a message from the site saying her photograph was being 'reviewed'.  

She told MailOnline: 'I don't expose myself when I breastfeed. I don't do it for attention. I do it to discreetly feed by child'. 

Ms Riley said she received an email the following day from Facebook informing her that it would not be deleted.

On the website, Facebook states that it has a 'strict' policy against the sharing of 'pornographic content' and 'any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved'. 

But it adds it 'aspires to respect people's right to share content of personal importance... like family photos of a child breastfeeding'.

Mrs Wright added that part of the issue was the 'sexualisation' of breastfeeding in Western culture.

She said: 'In the Western world breasts are sexualised, you see celebrities with their boobs out so people associate them with sex. 

'But people need to remember that first and foremost breasts are for feeding babies.' 

Last month, new mother Lou Burns made headlines when she was asked by staff at Claridge's to cover herself up while breastfeeding her then 12-week-old daughter Isadora.

Staff at the five-star hotel in Mayfair told Mrs Burns, 35, to use the napkin to avoid ‘causing offence’ to other guests.

And although she is smiling in this picture she posted on Twitter, the mother of three said she felt humiliated and burst into tears afterwards.

Upset: Lou Burns, 35, was breastfeeding her 12-week-old baby (left) at the luxury Claridge's hotel in Mayfair when waiters told her to cover up with a large napkin (right) to avoid 'causing offence' to fellow guests

Mrs Burns said the baby was not comfortable with the napkin over its head and was not able to feed properly.

Finally the management said she could continue without it as long as there were no complaints from anyone else.

She said the hotel knocked some money off the bill and apologised for upsetting her.

According to the Equality Act of 2010, it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding.

Outrage: Prestigious hotel Claridge's was criticised after staff ordered Ms Burns, 35, to cover herself up

However, last September a breastfeeding mother claimed today that she was ordered to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for a breakfast.

Olivia Pozniak, a single 25-year-old, was feeding her 11-week-old son Louie at the Furze Wren pub owned by J D Wetherspoon in Bexleyheath, Kent, when she was told to cover up.

Meanwhile in August Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'.

In June, a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant.

Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan.

Embarrassed: Mrs Burns, who was dining with her mother, sister and 12-week old daughter Isadora, said she was left so embarrassed by the incident that she would never return to the five star hotel

Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there.

It comes after around 70 women descended on Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre in April to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son.

She claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'.

The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room.
