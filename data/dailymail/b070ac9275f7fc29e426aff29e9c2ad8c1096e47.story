A rapist who preyed on women using online dating sites is facing life in prison after being found guilty on Monday.

Former Navy Lieutenant Sean Banks, 38, was found
 guilty of rape, rape of an intoxicated woman, forcible 
digital penetration and residential burglary with intent to commit rape by a San Diego jury. He was found not guilty of attempting to dissuade a witness. 

Banks, of Del Mar, used dating sites ChristianMingle.com and Match.com to target two women.

Sean Patrick Banks, 39, was convicted of five counts, including forcible rape and rape of an unconscious person. The defendant faces 40 years to life in prison when he is sentenced on September 5

During the trial, the two victims - named only as KK and RO - told the jury that Banks had raped them.

KK met Banks through ChristianMingle.com. She testified that she met Banks because she 'believed in God, scripture, going to church, reading the Bible and I wanted someone who had those same interests', the LA Times reported.

She invited him to her La Mesa home for a date on November 21, 2012 to watch a movie after weeks of talking and exchanging messages.

She said Banks then dragged her from her living room to her bedroom and raped her.

RO said Banks raped her in 2009 after they met on Match.com. 

During a police interview, the serviceman denied raping the women and dubbed KK 'crazy'. Banks did not testify at his trial.

Under California state law, allegations of rape do not have to be corroborated, so no DNA evidence was presented at the trial.

Banks' lawyer told NBC 7 that it was a 'he-said-she-said' case and that he is making plans for a new trial. The defense had argued that Banks left the women's homes when he was told to.

However the prosecution said that a 'very dangerous internet predator' was behind bars.

Banks, who worked as a computer technician, had targeted the women under different aliases - Rylan Butterwood, Rylan Harbough and Rarity. He told police this was because he wanted to change his name to Rylan.

Banks is facing 40 years to life in prison when he is sentenced on September 5.
