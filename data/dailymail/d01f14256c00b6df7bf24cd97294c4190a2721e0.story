A part-time model who had a £4,800 breast enlargement at taxpayers' expense has said she now wants the implants removed, and is expecting the NHS to foot the bill once more.

Josie Cunningham, 23, has said rather than improving her life her 
breast enhancement surgery has left her feeling self-conscious and has 
led to bullying, so she wants them removed.

The aspiring model hit the headlines earlier this year when she had her breasts increased from a 32A to 36DD on the NHS as she said she was being bullied for her smaller cleavage.

Josie says that although she hoped the operation would help her career, she has found that her bigger breasts have made her self-conscious. Pictured left, Josie before the enhancement and, right, after

Despite appearing in numerous publications to show off her new bustier look, the mother-of-two is now claiming that her new curves are preventing her from finding work.

Speaking to Closer magazine Josie, from Leeds, says: ‘They’re so big I find them embarrassing and I don’t feel I can do any modelling because they’ve attracted so much negative attention.. I’m thinking about having a reduction on the NHS.

‘I’m looking into charities that could help, but I think it’s down to the NHS because they made them so big,’ she argues.

Not totally oblivious to the plight of many who wait months on NHS waiting lists due to lack of budgets, Josie says of her use of taxpayer money: ’I feel awful when I hear about people in need who are refused treatment, but I don’t decide who the NHS helps.’

'There’s a queue and we’re all in it together. If it was my child that was ill I’d move heaven and earth, like any parent, but I don’t make the rules.'

The case caused outrage last month after it was revealed the NHS had funded Josie's operation while just a few miles away two-year-old Oliver Dockerty, who suffers from cerebral palsy, had been turned down for funding for an operation which could allow him to walk.

At the time his mother Claire said: 'Oliver has splints on his legs, a flexi-stand as he hasn’t got any balance, and uses a walking frame to get around.

Josie has previously flaunted her new breasts and even used this outfit to offer a tribute to the NHS for paying for her implants

Josie's two hour operation was performed after a seven month wait, and took her from a 32A to a 36DD cup

'He wants to be jumping in muddy puddles like Peppa Pig. He wants to be kicking a football and he can’t jump on a trampoline. I’d love to see him walking unaided for his first day at primary school.

'I’m a single parent and I don’t have that kind of money. Even if they look again at the decision, there’s going to be a big backlog of children like Oliver waiting to have this done.'

After the story appeared in the Daily Mail a deluge of support from readers contributed to the £24,000 raised in just one day on a fundraising web page set up for Oliver.

Following the operation, hoping her new bust line would help her dream career as a glamour model, Josie went to the media with her story,  but found herself at the receiving end of abuse.

She claims she was taunted trough social media and even shouted at down the street with people demanding their money back.

‘I don’t want to spend my life known as the girl with the massive NHS boobs, so having smaller implants is the only option,’ she says.

Josie was granted the initial breast surgery as she had a congenial medical condition which meant she had no breast tissue.

The part-time retail assistant was bullied from the age of 16 for her flat chest and said her breast didn’t even grow during her two pregnancies.

Placed on a waiting list in 2012, Josie had the two-hour operation seven months later at St James’s Hospital in Leeds.

She said: 'People don't understand that I deserved the surgery.

'I was born without breast tissue. I'm as worthy  as anyone else. And I thought working as a model would be a good way of paying back into the system through tax.'

However, she now hopes to re-join a waiting list for surgery to have the implants removed.

Unsurprisingly her story has caused upset, particularly as a drive to cut an additional £20 billion from the NHS budget has recently been announced.

Chief executive of the tax payers alliance Matthew Sinclair says: ‘It is ridiculous that taxpayers paid for this surgery in the first place.’
