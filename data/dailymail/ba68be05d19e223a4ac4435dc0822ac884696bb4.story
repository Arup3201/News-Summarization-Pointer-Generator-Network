Islamic State militants have bulldozed an ancient Iraqi city using heavy military vehicles in the latest attack on the country's historical heritage.

The jihadists are said to have gone on the rampage in the city of Nimrud in northern Iraq and even smashed up 3,000 year-old winged statues that are placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal.

The attack comes just days after ISIS extremists targeted a museum in Mosul by using power drills and sledgehammers to destroy artefacts, sparking global outrage.

A statement from Iraq's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities didn't elaborate on the extent of the damage.

However, they added that ISIS 'continues to defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity.'

The ancient city of Nimrud was the second capital of Assyria, an ancient kingdom that began in 900BC, partially in present day Iraq, and became a great regional power.

The city, which was destroyed in 612 BC, is located on the Tigris River, just south of Mosul, which was captured by ISIS last June.

In the late 1980s the discovery of treasures in Nimrud's royal tombs was one of the 20th century's most significant archaeological finds.

After Iraq was invaded in 2003, archaeologists were relieved to find the treasures had been hidden in the country's central bank inside a vault submerged in sewage water.

ISIS, who control a third of Iraq and Syria, have attacked other archaeological and religious sites, claiming that they promote apostasy.

Last year, the militants destroyed the Mosque of the Prophet Younis - or Jonah - and the Mosque of the Prophet Jirjis, two revered ancient shrines in Mosul.

They also threatened to destroy Mosul's 850-year old Crooked Minaret, but residents surrounded the structure, preventing the militants from approaching.

Iraq's national museum in Baghdad opened its doors to the public last week for the first time in 12 years in a move Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said was to defy efforts 'to destroy the heritage of mankind and Iraq's civilization.'

ISIS has imposed a harsh and violent version of Islamic law in the territories it controls and has terrorised religious minorities.

It has released gruesome videos online showing the beheading of captives, including captured Western journalists and aid workers.

A U.S.-led coalition has been striking the group since August, and Iraqi forces launched an offensive this week to try to retake the militant-held city of Tikrit, on the main road linking Baghdad to Mosul.

Jack Green, chief curator of the Oriental Institute Museum at the University of Chicago and expert on Iraqi art, said Thursday that ISIS seems bent on destroying objects they view as idols representing religions and cultures that don't conform to their beliefs.

He said: 'It's the deliberate destruction of a heritage and its images, intended to erase history and the identity of the people of Iraq, whether in the past or the present.

'And it has a major impact on the heritage of the region.'

Mr Green also noted that in many of these attacks on art, pieces that can be carried away are then sold to fund ISIS, while the larger artifacts and sculptures are destroyed at the site.
