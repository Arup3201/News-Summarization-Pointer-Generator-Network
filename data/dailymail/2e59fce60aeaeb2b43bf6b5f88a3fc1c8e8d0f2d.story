Snowfall expected in Detroit tonight could help push Michigan over the all-time record despite spring-like temperatures that neared 70F as late as 11pm Sunday.

If more than 1.9 inches drifts down over the Wolverine State before winter finally releases its icy grip, snowfall will exceed the 93.6 inch record set in 1880. Some forecasts predicted up to three inches Monday night.

While much of the East Coast reveled in summer-like temperatures Monday, even those were expected to fade into renewed wintery chills by Tuesday.

Say it ain't so: Deeply winter-weary Michigan will again see temperatures plummet Monday and the state's even poised to break an over 130-year-old yearlong snowfall record

Record-breaking: A January photo show's Detroit blanketed in the white stuff, a site that became all too familiar to Michiganders this year. If Detroit sees over 1.9 inches Monday, the state will beat record of 93.6 inches set way back in 1880

The dramatic step back into winter was prefaced by a barrage of soaking rains sweeping towards the east where the incoming cold front clashed with the outgoing warmth.

According to Accuweather.com, the chances of Michigan breaking its 130-year-old snowfall record are low but not out of the question.

On Sunday, the same storm system dumped six inches of snow onto Nebraska.

As the cold air pushes onward, the East Coasters who enjoyed temperatures in the 70s on MondayÂ  mercury could dip below freezing overnight Tuesday across the Ohio River Valley, the Appalachians and into the northeast just to the cusp of the I-95 corridor.

Only southern Florida can expect to be spared from what is hopefully one of this record-shattering winter's last stands.

WHY? The dramatic shift back into winter has already dumped 6 inches of snow on Nebraska and was poised to chill nearly all the East save for South Florida after a barrage of showers and severe thunderstorms

The Motor City saw temperatures in the high 60s on Sunday but expects flooding rains followed by snow tonight

A snowfall over 1.9 would put Michigan over the 93.6 inches record set in 1880

Meanwhile, the East Coast is experiencing summer-like temperatures, but only until Tuesday when the mercury will dip below freezing in some places
