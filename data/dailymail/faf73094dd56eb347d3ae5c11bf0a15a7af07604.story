Martin Fitzmaurice, the voice of BBC darts coverage, has quit after he was caught on camera telling racist jokes.

The compere has apologised for the remarks  about Asians and black people, and said his offer to resign had been accepted.

Mr Fitzmaurice, 72, known for his 'Let's play darts' catchphrase, was filmed during a break at a match between Scotland and England in Fife, Scotland last Sunday. He thought the cameras had been switched off. Among the audience was 14-year-old British Asian prodigy Jordan Singh.

Controversy: Darts compere Martin Fitzmaurice

Out of order: Fitzmaurice has apologised for his vile remarks

He said on Wednesday night: 'I have offered my resignation and they have accepted it.

'I made a mistake. I was having a bit of banter with the crowd.

'What happened took place because I was unaware the camera was on. If I have upset anyone I apologise.'

Mr Fitzmaurice, from Colchester, 
Essex, said he believed he was the victim of a set up, but he would not 
say who he believed was behind it.

He said: 'I'm a bit fed up and I'm upset my family has been brought into this.

'My children have been devastated and things that have been said about me are unbelievable.

'I know what I said was wrong but at 
the end of the day the damage is being done to the sport by those people
writing the filth.

'Anyone who knows about darts should know I have been round a long time and it's always been good.'

London-born Mr Fitzmaurice, who is married to Doreen and has four grown up daughters, moved to Colchester in 1975.

His long career in darts started when
he was asked to keep score in a match in a pub. He later started 
refereeing for professional darts player Bobby George, who lives in 
Ardleigh, and started working for the British Darts Organisation since 
1985.

The British Darts Organisation said 
it would be investigating the incident and has not publicly confirmed Mr
Fitzmaurice's resignation.

A spokesman said: 'We apologise unreservedly for the fact racially offensive comments were made by MC Martin Fitzmaurice.'

'He will be required to face a disciplinary hearing in front of the BDO Board.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'As someone who has appeared in previous 
tournaments we have televised we are appalled by the alleged remarks.'
