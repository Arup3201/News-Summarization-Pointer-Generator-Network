A new start: Formerly a multi-millionaire, Carroll now earns £204 a week in a factory in Scotland

A little over 10 years ago Michael Carroll was sitting on a £10million fortune after scooping the lottery.

But now the money has gone and he has been forced to take a job in a biscuit factory for just £204 a week.

His ignominious journey from rags to riches and back again has included squandering money on fast cars, huge quantities and drugs and drink and has even included two spells in prison.

Divorced from his wife, Sandra, the man dubbed the ‘lotto lout’ has now had to move north to Scotland to be near his 10-year-old daughter, Brooke.

And at one stage he was so broke he was forced to sleep rough in a forest while looking for work.

But despite the wasted money, the stints behind bars and the broken marriage, Carroll, 30, - who styled himself as the King of Chavs - says he is happier now.

He said: ‘I moved to Scotland to be closer to Brooke and to get out of my drinking - friends said the drink and drugs would have killed me within six months and I’ve been clean of drugs for over two years.

‘I’d had 10 years of doing what a rock star does and I had to sort myself out so I decided to head up to Scotland and it’s great – I love it up here.

‘In Norfolk I crashed on a mate’s sofa but I’ve got a two-bedroom council flat just outside Elgin so I’m well sorted.’

Carroll won £9.7million on the National Lottery in 2002 and immediately set about spending it.

He gave £4m to friends and family, bought a mansion in Swaffham, Norfolk, and splashed out on racing cars.

He admits wasting millions on cocaine, drink, gambling and prostitutes, all washed down with two bottles of vodka a day.

He was handed an ASBO for terrorising his neighbours and he was jailed for five months in 2004 after failing to comply with a drug treatment order imposed as part of a sentence for cocaine possession and in February 2006 he was jailed for nine months for affray.

By February 2010, he was declared bankrupt and was back on Jobseeker’s Allowance after admitted blowing the fortune.

Today Carroll has swapped high rock star 
lifestyle for a hairnet and white overalls to turn out tartan tins of 
shortbread at the Walkers factory in Elgin, Morayshire.

Tattooed Carroll, who has shed five stone after taking part in a TV fitness documentary, said: ‘I get £204 every week for packing and stacking shortbread and cookies and I love it. I treasure those wages more than any £9million fortune.

‘I’ve got all I need so this is a new start for me. When I first moved up I was in a tent for a week in the woods because I had nowhere to go and hadn’t started at the factory.

‘Sitting there in the woods was when I first thought I could sort myself out properly.’

Two months ago he got a job as a packer with Walkers and now works a six-hour shift, five days a week with more than 200 colleagues on the production line, boxing up biscuits and shortbread. The products are then shipped off around the world.

Carroll said: ‘I’m so happy to get a wage-packet again. I’m definitely happier because I’m back to reality. A few people recognised me when I started but everyone’s been brilliant. I had lots of questions about the money in the first few days and where it all went.

‘I said I was a 19-year-old d***head who went nuts – what teenager wouldn’t? But now I’m 30 it’s time to grow up. I love the work – I couldn’t sit here on benefits.

He says he cycles almost everywhere after being banned for drink-driving and enjoys nothing better than playing games on his X-Box in the evening.

He said: ‘I used to arrange banger-racing in the field behind my mansion but these days I just play Grand Theft Auto and Grid 2 on my X-Box.

Carroll said he still plays the lottery but says he would spend the mney on helping others if he won again.

He said: ‘The only thing I’ve won recently is my life back. But if I won £9million again I’d help kids on drugs – then emigrate to Australia, buy some properties, rent them out and sit back and wait on the money to come in. Don’t get me wrong, though – I’d still have a few parties.’
