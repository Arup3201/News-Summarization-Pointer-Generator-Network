West Ham loanee Carl Jenkinson looks set to miss the start of the season after suffering a hamstring injury on his debut in Germany.

The Arsenal defender only joined the Hammers on a season-long deal on Thursday but was forced off after 60 minutes of the 2-0 defeat to Malaga in Gelsenkirchen.

Jenkinson's injury is the latest blow for boss Sam Allardyce who has already lost striker Andy Carroll until December following ankle surgery and is without right back Guy Demel who has a hamstring problem.

Enner Valencia was signed for Â£12million to replace the stricken Carroll but the Ecuador striker is short of fitness and he, too, will miss the campaign opener against Spurs a week on Saturday.

And midfielder Mark Noble admits the squad are already looking to Valencia to answer their problems in the final third.

'We need him (Valencia) at the minute,' said Noble before the squad returned to London last night having failed to score a goal at the Schalke 04 Cup.

'We need another striker and we're light on players.

'Jenko has gone down with a slight hamstring and Guy Demel isn't here and big AC (Carroll) is injured.

'I don't even think (the manager) knows his starting XI at the minute what with players coming in, players being injured and players not being quite fit yet.

'Hopefully we can get another couple of signings in, good players who are going to improve the squad.'

Peter Crouch is one possibility for Allardyce while Sunderland's Connor Wickham could emerge as a target should he not be offered a new contract at the Stadium of Light.
