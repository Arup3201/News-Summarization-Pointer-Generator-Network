David Cameron’s fate as Tory leader will hang in the balance and he could feel ‘duty bound’ to resign if Scotland votes for independence, his allies conceded last night.

Even some Cabinet ministers who are supportive of the Prime Minister’s leadership admit his future will be ‘difficult’ – despite his insistence he would ‘emphatically’ not quit in the event of a Yes vote.

One told the Mail he would have a responsibility to stay on and deal with the aftermath of Scotland voting to break away but could then be forced out or feel ‘duty-bound’ to go.

Another said Mr Cameron would have a ‘very difficult’ period, but was likely to survive because of the proximity of the general election and the lack of any obvious replacement.

Officers on the Conservatives’ 1922 Committee, which represents backbench MPs, are understood to have quietly canvassed opinion over the weekend on whether Mr Cameron might lose a vote of confidence.

The Prime Minister has effectively ceded control of the No campaign to his old enemy Gordon Brown, and is not expected to appear in Scotland this week. Strategists admit their party is still so divisive north of the border that too much exposure of senior Conservative ministers might prove counterproductive.

Later this week, the Prime Minister is expected to back proposals for rapid devolution of more powers over taxation, public spending and welfare rates to Scotland in the event of a no vote.

He has also urged Labour figures to halt the separatist surge by making the ‘emotional case’ for preserving the Union, rather than focusing on negative warnings.

After what were seen as crisis talks with the Queen at Balmoral at the weekend, Mr Cameron is understood to have insisted that the campaign focus on the ‘heart rather than the head’ in its final ten days.

‘He wants to make the emotional argument about all that England and Scotland have achieved together – and all they can continue to achieve,’ said one source.

Under Conservative party rules, a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron is triggered if at least 15 per cent of backbenchers – currently 46 MPs – write to Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, requesting one.

Some Tory MPs say Mr Cameron’s credibility will be shattered if, as head of what is officially called the Conservative and Unionist Party, he has and presided over the end of the UK. One minister said the Prime Minister would also face questions about his concessions to Alex Salmond on the timing of the referendum, the ballot’s wording and the extension of the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds.

‘The way the question is worded so that No is the vote for the Union has made it seem a negative rather than a positive thing,’ the minister said.

After the election of the SNP government in 2011, the Government originally insisted must hold the referendum by September 2013. But a later vote was permitted in exchange for First Minister Alex Salmond agreeing to a single Yes or No question. He initially wanted a second question on so-called ‘devo max’ – the devolution of more powers.

Some senior Conservatives now believe it was a fundamental error to exclude a ‘third way’ from the ballot paper, since it would have allowed pro-Unionists to campaign against No while urging those voters who want change to back a ‘best of both worlds’ option.

Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former Tory foreign secretary, pointed out that more than 90 per cent of Tory voters in Scotland are backing the No campaign, while Labour has steadily leached support to Yes. The latest polling suggests as many as 35 per cent of Labour voters could back independence.

‘You can hardly blame the Prime Minister for Labour people deserting their own party,’ he said.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is also likely to face a leadership crisis if Scotland votes Yes.

Sam Dale, writing on the Labour supporters’ website Labour Uncut, said he would shoulder ‘most blame’ in the event of a Yes vote and would also have to resign.

‘It was the hapless Labour campaign for the Scottish Parliament in 2011 that let the SNP in power. It is a disaster that Miliband oversaw but has never been fully held to account for within Labour circles,’ he said.

‘For the SNP to gain a majority required Labour ineptitude on a grand scale. Ever since, Labour has provided woeful opposition to the SNP in Scotland.

‘Since the referendum campaign began it has been crystal clear that Labour voters would decide the vote. Unlike David Cameron, Miliband had a chance to convince his own supporters and turn the referendum. He did not intervene often enough or effectively.’
