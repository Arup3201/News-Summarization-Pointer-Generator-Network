Everton midfielder Leon Osman has declared himself fit and raring to go after completing 90 minutes for The Toffees' Under 21s side against Sunderland. 

The 33-year-old spent nearly three months on the sidelines earlier this season after sustaining a split tendon during the Premier League game with Manchester City back in December. 

Osman made cameo appearances from the substitutes' bench in Everton's recent 3-1 win over Young Boys and 2-0 defeat by Stoke, but now having managed a full run out for the Under 21s, he is hoping to reclaim his starting spot.

Speaking on Thursday to EvertonTV, Osman said, 'It's important for me to get as many minutes as I can on the pitch.' 

He added, 'The games came quick and close together, but I'm just trying to get myself out there as much as I can.

'It was good to get more minutes under my belt, I'm trying to get that last little bit of sharpness and hopefully then I can show that on the pitch for the first team.' 

Now, Osman is hoping to be involved from the off for Everton when they face Dynamo Kyiv in the last 16 tie of the Europa League next week. 

Osman was also used as a substitute against Young Boys during the Europa League round of 32

While The Toffees have performed well in continental competition this season, the same cannot be said for their Premier League form, which seems them sit 14th in the table and with three losses in their last four games.    

Osman has revealed how frustrating that poor run has been for the team, and has issued a rallying cry to improve.   

'It's not great being out injured for any player, I'm especially bad when I'm out injured and it's even harder when things aren't going well on the pitch for the team.

'But we're in it as a team. We're in it together whether you're injured, or if you're playing every week. We've got 10 tough games now before the end of the season, but 10 games we're very confident of getting results from.'
