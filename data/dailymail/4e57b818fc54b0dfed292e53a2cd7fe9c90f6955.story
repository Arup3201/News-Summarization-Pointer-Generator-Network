A grandmother has been dubbed 'Rambo' after pulling out a gun to fight off two alleged armed robbers who attacked her in her Detroit driveway.

Paris Ainsworth, 51, was shot four times in the late-night attack, but was able to return fire with eight bullets from her licensed .45 caliber handgun.

The health worker said her weapon saved her life.

'If I wouldn't have had my gun I would be dead today,' the grandmother-of-four told WDIV. 'This is ludicrous, the way that they are just robbing and trying to take stuff from people, and killing people.'

Survivor: Grandmother-of-four Paris Ainsworth, 51, said she fired at two robbers who shot her four times outside her Detroit home on the weekend

Tough: Paris Ainsworth, 51 (pictured left and right) said she had just returned to her Detroit home when two men threatened her with guns

Ainsworth said she was returning home to the 15400 block of Beaverland from a double shift on the weekend, when she saw two men approaching her.

She said she slipped her handgun into her pocket before she got out of the car. She said one of the men then shot her four times - three in the side and once in the hand.

'He said, 'Don't pull it,' and he shot immediately',' Ainsworth said.

Ainsworth then pulled out her gun and fired.

'I said, 'You mother (expletive),' and pulled out (my gun) and started shooting. One, he was right in the middle of the street. The other one was right here on the (side of the street),' she said.

When the alleged attackers fled, Ainsworth waited on a neighbor's porch until EMS arrived.

'I kept applying pressure to my side and where the blood was coming from,' she said.

Treatment: Paris Ainsworth was taken to Sinai-Grace Hospital in west Detroit (pictured) for treatment, the same place where her two alleged attackers showed up and were arrested

The Detroit resident was rushed to Sinai-Grace Hospital for treatment - the same place where her alleged attackers were arrested. One of the attackers was shot in both legs.

'The victim told officers that she fired her handgun at the suspects when they attempted to rob her and did not know if the shots took effect,' Detroit police said in a statement, according to UPI.

'While at the scene, another police run was called in from the hospital stating that a male was shot. The officers went to the hospital and the male that was shot matched the description given by the victim.'

Ainsworth said the attack brought back memories of being hit with a gun by a mugger 10 years ago.

Two years ago, she got a concealed weapons permit, believing that people have a right to protect themselves with guns.

'He (the weekend attacker) didn't shoot me because he felt that I was going to shoot him. He didn't care. He just shot. He didn't look like, 'Oh my God I shouldn't have.' He just had the devil in him,' she said.

'I thank God that I'm here with my family. It was horrible. I never want to see anything like that again.'

'No man, no law, no war can stop him': Grandmother-of-four Paris Ainsworth, 51, has been dubbed 'Rambo' - the gun-toting character played by Sylvester Stallone - for fighting off two alleged attackers with a pistol
