Orphaned: 12-year-old Lewis Clough's father was killed in a road smash just six weeks after his mother died from cancer

A 12-year-old boy has been orphaned after his father was killed in a road smash just six weeks after his mother died from cancer.

Lewis Clough will have to attend the funerals of his mother Mandy Kay and father Ian Clough within the space of less than two months.

He is now being cared for by his father’s fiancé, who has pledged to care for him as her own, at the home they shared in Barnsley, South Yorks.

Tearful Dawn Porter, who would have 
become Lewis’ step-mother in 2014 said: 'I will give Lewis all the love 
and support that I can because he needs it and deserves it – because I 
love him.'

His
father Ian Clough was killed on his to work at a timber window and door
frame factory, in Darton last week after his motorbike smashed into an 
oncoming car. He was 44.

The bike left the road and ended up down an embankment. Mr Clough suffered head injuries and died at the scene.

Lewis’s
mother Mandy Kay had split from Ian two years ago after 18 years 
together but the schoolboy moved back in with his father after she was 
diagnosed with cancer and became ill.

Dawn
said: 'Of course it was very hard for Lewis when his mum died, we tried
our best to give him the stability and love any child would been in 
those terrible circumstances.'

The 46-year-old, who has five grown up children, said that Ian and Lewis had already picked out her wedding dress together.

She
added: 'Their relationship was growing stronger and stronger every day 
and we were all looking forward to our wedding.

'Now in the space of less
than two months Lewis will have been at both of his parents’ funerals.

'That
is quite something for a young boy to cope with, but I am determined to
ensure he has all the love he needs and the people around here have 
been so very kind and supportive.'

Emotional Dawn said that the night Ian, who will be cremated next Wednesday,  died, she ‘knew something terrible’ had happened when he failed to text her as he usually did to tell her he had arrived safely and was about to start his night shift.

She said: 'I knew before the police turned up to knock at the door. I loved Ian so much and we were planning the rest of our lives together as a family.

'I’m heartbroken but I have to be strong for Lewis because he needs me.'

Lewis’s grandmother, on his father’s side, Faith Clough from Barnsley, said: 'Ian was a much loved son, a devote dad and his many friends are offering us their love and support and I am very grateful.'

The vehicles collided on a sweeping bend near to Bence Lane.

The motorbike left the road and ended up down an embankment.

Ian suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The 82-year-old car driver, also from Barnsley, is believed to have escaped uninjured.

Police want to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the manner of driving prior to the incident or anyone who saw the collision.
