Manchester United want a loan fee of £4million for Danny Welbeck, with Sunderland and Tottenham both interested in the England forward.

United are prepared to let the 23-year-old leave Old Trafford for the season with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie ahead of him in the Old Trafford pecking order.

Welbeck spent the 2010-11 season on loan at Sunderland but it is understood he would prefer a move to Spurs.

In demand: Tottenham and Sunderland both want to sign Manchester United's Danny Welbeck on loan

Both Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino and Sunderland boss Gus Poyet are keen to add a frontman to their ranks on deadline day.

Pochettino is still pursuing a move for Southampton’s Jay Rodriguez while Poyet is optimistic an agreement can be reached with Liverpool for the sale of Fabio Borini.

But Welbeck is seen as an attractive alternative for both should those moves fail to materialise.

Pondering: Mauricio Pochettino knows he needs another striker though the doors at Tottenham
