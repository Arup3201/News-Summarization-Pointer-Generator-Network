A new survey of women aged 31 has found the majority would consider freezing their eggs in the interests of their careers or waiting to find the right partner

Nine in 10 women say they would consider freezing their eggs in the interests of furthering their career, or to give them the time to find the perfect partner, new research has revealed.

The survey showed almost half of women would consider the move to preserve fertility, while the majority of those taking part supported the treatment.

Dr Camille Lallemant and her team at the Princess Anne Hospital's Complete Fertility Centre in Southampton, Hampshire, questioned 973 women of an average age of 31 in the UK and Denmark via an anonymous online survey.

Results showed the majority of respondents - 83 per cent - had heard of egg freezing - known as oocyte freezing - and nearly all of them - 99.4 per cent - considered it acceptable for medical reasons, such as before the start of cancer treatment.

Almost as many - 89.1 per cent - considered it acceptable in order to delay the start of their family until social and domestic circumstances were more appropriate.

And 19 per cent of respondents in the survey said they were actively considering oocyte freezing treatment themselves, with another 27 per cent interested in the technique.

Dr Lallemant said: 'Until very recently, no options for preserving fertility in order to delay childbearing existed, but vitrification has revolutionised oocyte freezing and made it effective and convenient.

'However, before the launch of this study, we were still not clear to what extent women were aware of its possibilities and limitations, or of attitudes towards its use or the circumstances in which they might consider it.'

The researchers also found women were more concerned with their biological clock than their careers.

The main reasons identified for women 
wanting to freeze their eggs were being under 35 years old, not having a
 partner by that age, childlessness and a history of infertility.

Dr Lallemant said: 'In terms of personal circumstances, career aspirations remain less important than the biological clock and having found a partner by age 35.'

In the UK, oocyte freezing is still described as a relatively new development, with fewer than 20 live births reported by December 2012.

Dr Lallemant added: 'While both our clinics in Southampton and Copenhagen receive many inquiries about options for fertility planning, few women as yet have actually chosen oocyte freezing for this purpose, though we are however seeing growing interest in the technique.'

The findings were presented today at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Munich.
