This is the first picture of a woman, Nari, believed to have been murdered by fugitive Briton Stuart Green

A British man wanted in connection with a murder in Cambodia is said to have been arrested.

Stuart Green, from Eccles, Manchester, is accused of slashing the throat for a local woman at a Phnom Penh hotel.

The news of his arrest was reported on an online expatriate forum, which gave details of where 47-year-old Green is said to have been staying after checking out of the hotel where the body of a woman, known locally as Nari, was found.

According to a writer using the pseudonym JimmyChina, Stuart was arrested in a guest house located behind an establishment called the Lone Brothers Bikers Bar, used as the headquarters of an expatriate motor cycle club.

In broken English, JimmyChina wrote: ‘He will stay long time in prison - not think he will live long inside that place of prison. (sic)'

‘Now you can be happy your fellow countryman found. (sic)' he added

British expatriates writing on the forum made it clear they did not want to be associated with Green, responding that he was no fellow countrymen of theirs.

Green had checked into the £12-a-night Bolyna Palace Hotel in Phnom Penh with a Cambodian woman on Christmas Day.

A photo, posted on an expatriate forum by a writer using the name Ross, said the woman was named Nari and was 'a nice girl'. Police have so far refused to formally identify the dead woman.

He went to the reception desk at around 11pm on December 28, asking for his passport to be returned so he could go to a bank and get money to pay for his room.

Even though banks are not open at that time, the passport was returned, Green walked out - and did not come back.

The following day a cleaner found the naked body of the young woman under the bed, her throat slashed and a number of other knife wounds in her neck.

Expatriates on the online forum has been speculating that Green might have been able to cross a 'loosely-guarded' border into a neighbouring country - most likely Thailand.

Others have suggested he is hiding out in a remote 'flophouse' or a village where locals do not know that police are looking for him.

If the dead woman is indeed Nari, she appears to have been liked by a number of expatriates.

One writer commented: 'I didn't know her and I wish she'd had a different lifestyle and life opportunities, but I do hope they capture the bastard who killed her.'

A correspondent using the name Chicorytip wrote: 'Yes, that's the girl. She was a bit crazy in a sweet and funny way. She was a good person.

'I remember her bringing her pet rabbit to the White Cobra bar. RIP.'

Despite demands from expatriates, Phnom Penh police have still failed to issue a photo of Green.
