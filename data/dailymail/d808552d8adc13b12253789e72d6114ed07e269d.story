Attack: Lindsay Sandiford says the Government has let her down over her death sentence appeal

A British grandmother who has been sentenced to death in Bali for drug smuggling says the British Government has let her down.

Lindsay Sandiford is due to be executed by a firing squad after an Indonesian court convicted her of taking £1.6million of cocaine into the country in May last year.

The 56-year-old is planning to appeal against her draconian sentence, but has failed in a bid to force the UK Government to fund her legal case.

Speaking to Victoria Derbyshire on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sandiford said the Government's refusal to pay for her lawyers was 'tantamount to condoning the death penalty'.

The talk-show host sent 14 questions Ms Sandiford, originally from Redcar, Teesside, via charity Reprieve, and she chose to answer two of them.

When asked if she thought the British Government was doing enough to help her case, she said: 'The Government has done very little to support me. The FCO has done even less.

'However, I have been able to talk about my situation and will continue to do so because there are others in a similar desperate plight that are not seen.

'There are, and will continue to be, British nationals facing execution without lawyers, and because they can not raise their voices the Government is standing by refusing to assist with funding of lawyers for them.

'This action is tantamount to condoning the death penalty. JustGiving and the public have done what the British Government fight not to do at great public expense.

'The Government and FCO are doing all they can to resist me at this difficult time.'

Sandiford took the opportunity to thank those who have helped her through her ordeal, saying their efforts were 'like a ray of sunshine'.

'I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the people who made donations together with the uplifting messages of support,' she said.

'In my darkest hour, this was like a ray of sunshine. I was beginning to feel that my situation was unbearable. I felt totally stranded and alone.

'The public's caring has shown just how wrong you can be. I am blessed to know my family loved me whatever. Just giving has shown me that you're never alone. People really do care when they know.'

The deadline for Sandiford to launch a fresh appeal against her sentence is early next week, according to Reprieve.
