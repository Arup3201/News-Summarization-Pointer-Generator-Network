A slavery-era law that allows for prisoners in Jamaica to be whipped with a cat o' nine tails is to be abolished on the island.

The Caribbean country's justice ministry has said the 'degrading' corporal punishment will be removed from the penal code.

The punishment allows for prisoners to be whipped with a cat o' nine tails - which consists of nine knotted cords - or a rod made from the branches of a tamarind tree.

'Degrading': The news that the flogging of prisoners with a cat o' nine tails (pictured) is to be banned in Jamaica has been welcomed by human rights activists

Courts in the former British colony stopped ordering the punishment in 2004, but ministers want to see the law abolished entirely.

Jamaica's Justice Minister Mark Golding said flogging was a 'degrading' anachronism that violates the country's international obligations and is preventing the government from ratifying the U.N. convention against torture.

'Anachronism': Jamaica's Justice Minister Mark Golding said it was time to get the law 'off our books once and for all'

'The time has come to regularise this situation by getting these colonial-era laws off our books once and for all,' Mr Golding said in a statement.

The move to repeal the whipping law has already been approved by the cabinet in Jamaica, where plantation slavery was particularly brutal.

The 
announcement was welcomed by human rights activists who view flogging as
a barbaric throwback in a nation populated mostly by the descendants of
slaves.

Susan Goffe, chairwoman of Jamaicans for Justice, said: 'We don't really see that [the flogging law] has any part in the approach of dealing with crime in a modern democracy.'

But
there are no shortage of crime-weary Jamaicans who feel that 
authorities should not drop the old statutes but instead enforce them, 
arguing that thieves who steal livestock or violent criminals who harm 
innocent people should receive a whipping to teach them a lesson.

'The
worst criminals need strong punishing or else they'll do crimes over 
and over,' said Chris Drummond, a father of three from Kingston.

'Getting locked up is not always enough.'

The
last person to suffer the punishment in Jamaica was Errol Pryce, who 
was sentenced to four years in prison and six lashes in 1994 for 
stabbing his mother-in-law.Â 

Pryce
was flogged the day before being released from prison in 1997 and later
complained to the U.N. Human Rights Committee, which ruled in 2004 that
the form of corporal punishment was cruel, inhuman and degrading and 
violated his rights.

Jamaican courts then stopped ordering flogging.
