It seems that Kevin Pietersen is as good at bombing into a swimming pool as England are at beating Australia at cricket.

The exiled England batsman appears to have been enjoying some time by the swimming pool while Eoin Morgan's side were once again mercilessly dissected by their arch rivals in their opening game at the cricket World Cup.

The 34-year-old Pietersen posted a video to his Instagram account with the caption 'top bombing?!' that shows him taking a running leap into a swimming pool, while tucking his legs into his body and inexplicably turning sideways before hitting the water.

Kevin Pietersen takes a run up before leaping into the air to bomb into the swimming pool

Once he is airborne, Pietersen decides to twist himself sideways as he descends towards the water

And he still makes a big splash despite landing sideways as opposed to having his legs tucked underneath

Pietersen recently enjoyed a spell with Melbourne Stars in Australia's Big Bash League

It surely stung Pietersen upon impact, but not as much as England's 111-run defeat to co-hosts Australia on Saturday. 

Had it not been for the defiance of James Taylor's unbeaten 98, the margin of Australia's victory would have been much more emphatic.

Pietersen will undertake commentary duties with BBC's Test Match Special from the quarter-final stage onwards and it remains to be seen whether he will be running the rule over the England side.
