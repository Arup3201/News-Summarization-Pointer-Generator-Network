A letter written by Darren Wilson thanking people who’d supported him since the shooting of Michael Brown in August has been leaked despite the Ferguson police officer asking for it to remain private.

In the letter, Wilson said the support and dedication he had received had been 'amazing' and had ‘brought tears to my eyes.’

Wilson also asked his supporters to not pass the letter to the media - but one person disregarded that request in the wake of Monday's decision by a grand jury not to indict him.

A letter written by Darren Wilson thanking people who’d supported him since the shooting of Michael Brown in August has been leaked despite the Ferguson police officer asking for it to remain private

In the letter, Officer Wilson said that the support and dedication he had received since shooting Michael Brown in August had been 'amazing' and ‘brought tears to my eyes’

The anonymous supporter told KDSK in St. Louis that many of Wilson's supporters have ties to the police and are worried about the violent protests that have followed Monday's verdict.

The supporter, who had been in touch with Wilson over the past few months, said the focus of the thousands of people who have been supporting the officer now turns to the law enforcement responding to the violence in Ferguson.

In his first televised interview since Monday's verdict, the 28-year-old told ABC News' George Stephanopoulus  that the first time he ever fired his gun in his five-year career as a police officer was the August afternoon he shot dead black teen Michael Brown.

Wilson spoke with Stephanopoulos at a secret location less than 24 hours after it was announced that a grand jury decided not to indict him on any charges related to the August 9 shooting.

To all of the pro Officer Wilson Supporters -

I would like to thank you all for standing up for me during this stressful time. 

Your support and dedication is amazing and it is still hard to believe that all of these people that I have never met are doing so much for me. 

I watched the CNN video we recorded at the rally on Saturday and it brought tears to my eyes.

All of you are simply amazing, and I don't know how to thank you all enough. 

I wish I could attend meet you, hug you, and personally thank you for all of your continued support, however, due to my and my families safety I am unable to. 

Please don't give this letter to any media or post it where they can see it. Relay the message of thanks to all and keep this letter private until the investigation is complete.

I want you all to know that I do get updates on the amount of support. Unfortunately, I don't get to see all of the comments made through social media, but overall messages are relayed to me.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart, and know that I would do the same for any of you.

Also please keep my family in blue in your hearts and prayers, they have all made a sacrifice to their own lives in order to work the excessive hours through the heat and rain to ensure that the riots and protests in Ferguson were as safe as they could be.

Thank you,

P.O. Darren Wilson

In his first televised interview since Monday's verdict, the 28-year-old told ABC News ' George Stephanopoulus that the first time he ever fired his gun in his five-year career as a police officer was the August afternoon he shot dead black teen Michael Brown

His side of the story: Wilson walked Stephanopoulus through the day of the shooting, from the moment he ordered Brown and a friend off the street to the fatal shots that killed the 18 year old 

Victim: Michael Brown was shot dead by Wilson on August 9. The community of Ferguson, Missouri erupted in violence Monday night after the grand jury's decision was announced 

In a segment of the interview which aired on ABC's World News on Tuesday evening, Wilson explained step by step the confrontation with Brown that culminated with the 18-year-old's death. 

He also said he feels no guilt and now just wants a normal life with his new wife. 

'The reason I have a clear conscience is because I know I did my job right,' Wilson said.

As the grand jury's decision was announced Monday night, St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch revealed that Wilson heard a call over the radio on August 9 about a robbery suspect which matched the description of Brown. 

Wilson told ABC that he spotted Brown and a friend walking down the center of the street, not far from the convenience store where the theft was reported.

The police officer asked the two to move to the sidewalk, and says Brown refused and got violent, reaching into his police vehicle to strike him on the cheek.

Wilson went on to grab Brown's forearm, and says it was then that he first realized how mighty the 6-foot-4, 292-pound 18-year-old was. 

'He was a very large, a very powerful man,' Wilson recalled, adding that he himself is 'above average' at 6-foot-4 and 210 pounds. 

While the struggle ensued in the SUV, Wilson says Brown reached for his gun and and tried to turn the firearm on him.

Wilson fired his first shots then, but the first few pulls on the trigger failed because Brown's fingers were jamming the trigger.

One shot finally got through, and that was the first bullet to hit Brown, Wilson said. 

The teen then backed off and started walking away, but Wilson pursued, saying it's not his job to 'sit and wait'. He radioed for backup, saying shots have been fired and then gave chase.

That's when Brown turned around and started coming back towards the officer. Wilson says he also saw the teen reach towards his waistband, and feared Brown may be concealing a weapon - though he showed no indication that he had one when they were fighting seconds earlier.

'My initial thought was, is there a weapon in there?' Wilson said.

As the teen started 'charging' towards him, Wilson said he feared for his life and thought: 'Can I shoot this guy,? Legally can I? And the answer was I have to, he will kill me if he gets to me.'

Secret wedding: On Monday morning, it was revealed that 28-year-old Wilson (left) - who hasn't been seen in public since the shooting - quietly married his fellow officer, Barbara Spradling (right), 37, last month

The final fatal shots were fired when Brown was just eight to 10 feet away, Wilson said. It was the first time in his five years as a police officer that Wilson ever had to fire his weapon, he confessed. 

The officer went on to express no regret in shooting Brown, saying he wouldn't have done anything differently if he had to live the experience over again. He also said he would have acted the same if the teen were white, denying any racial profiling on his part.

Now, Wilson just wants to move on with his life. It was revealed this week that he married a fellow Ferguson police officer Barbara Spradling, 37, this month in a ceremony officiated by one of his lawyers. 

'We just want to have a normal life, that’s it,' Wilson said.  

Wilson is on paid leave while the Police Department conducts an internal review of the Brown shooting to see whether Wilson violated any policies.
