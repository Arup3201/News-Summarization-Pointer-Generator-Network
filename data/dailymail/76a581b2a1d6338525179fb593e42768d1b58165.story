Almost 25 years after being videotaped smoking crack with a woman in a hotel room, former Washington D.C. Mayor Marion Barry still insists that he was a victim of an entrenched white power structure.

In a new memoir out this week called 'Mayor for Life,' Barry writes about his decades in politics, the stunning fall from grace that has come to define his career, and the people he still holds responsible.

A review from the New York Post calls Barry 'the original Rob Ford' and marvels over his insistence that he was set up.

In his new book, Marion Barry claims he was the victim of powerful white men who didn't like his challenge to the status quo

Berry was arrested after being caught on tape smoking crack cocaine in 1990

Barry, who claims he gave city contracts to black business owners that it eventually took up 47 per cent of the city's $2 billion budget, writes that his challenge to the status quo put a target on his back.

'White folks may let you in their country clubs to play golf, invite 
you out to dinner, take you out to play tennis, but when it comes to 
dividing up the money, that’s a whole ’nother story,' he writes. 'They 
didn’t want me creating all of these opportunities for black folks. So 
when the FBI set me up at the Vista [Hotel], they were really trying to 
kill me. If they killed me, they wouldn’t have to worry about me 
anymore.'

There are some who would agree. The surveillance video of Barry smoking crack in 1990 led to six months in prison for drug possession charges. And despite the city's own struggles against a sweeping and destructive crack epidemic, but he was released to massive crowds who considered him a hero. He was elected mayor again in 1994.

To this day he retains a seat on the D.C. city council.

Despite a public disgrace, Barry was elected mayor again in 1994

Barry said he first experimented with cocaine in the late 1980s when the married then-mayor found himself alone with a woman at a friend's house after a long night of drinking.

Barry remembers that after she came back from a third trip to the bathroom she told him: “That’s some good s—. You want some? This makes my p—- hot.”

'At first I hesitated,' Barry writes. 'I had never done anything like 
that before. But this woman’s comment excited me. So I was curious. If 
cocaine made this woman feel that hot, I wondered how it would make me 
feel.'

After accidentally blowing cocaine all over on a botched first attempt, Barry finally inhaled the powerful narcotic.

'That was my first time ever trying cocaine, and I felt like I had 
ejaculated,' he writes. 'The cocaine was a powerful stimulant that went 
straight to my penis. What happened next? I had sex with her.'

Barry claims he gave city contracts to black businesses, angering powerful people

That was the first step on the road to the Vista Hotel on Jan. 18, 1990, a day he refers to as 'the war to reclaim Washington for white people.'

In his telling, he was set up that day by Rasheeda Moore, a teacher and former model then in her 30s who he had fallen for.

He claims she was addicted to cocaine while he remained a casual user hoping to quit entirely. The breaking point between them came when he found her smoking crack in an executive suite at the Grand Hyatt Hotel at an AIDS fundraiser, and proceeded to smash her pipe.

He also found five crack rocks in her purse that he tried to flush down the toilet Moore wrestled them away. 'It was like Diana Ross in ‘Lady Sings The Blues,’' he remembers. 'I 
wasn’t a violent person. I had never hit a woman in my life, but I had 
to smack Rasheeda upside her head and push her down to get her off me. I
 told her, ‘Rasheeda, you gots to go now!’'

Barry remains active in Washington D.C. politics and holds a seat on the city council

He avoided her for months after. But, he claims, when his enemies discovered she had a bench warrant for failing to appear at a grand jury hearing they used the threat of jail to get her to cooperate.

The FBI then 'put her up at the 
Vista Hotel, placed cameras in the room, supplied the drugs and told her
 what to say. They even babysat her kids.'

Once in D.C. she harassed Barry until he finally agreed to meet with her.

Though he claims to have arrived at the Vista with a security detail agreeing to meet Moore in the lobby, he was outfoxed when the woman he last saw screaming in a drug-fueled rage told him: 'I just 
ordered a bowl of soup, but once I finish that, we can come back 
downstairs. Now come on up.'

Barry claims a former lover was coerced to set him up by the FBI

Once he went upstairs, his resolve began to weaken.

'I started thinking sexually while sipping my drink,' he writes. 'But 
every time I reached to caress her breasts, she pulled away from me. 
Then she said, ‘Let’s do something.’ That was Rasheeda’s code word for 
drug talk.'

The rest is history. He was tried on 11 counts of cocaine possession and three coutns of perjury. A racially divided jury hung on all charges except for a misdemeanor count of drug possession and putting Barry behind bars as 'a political prisoner.'

His campaign slogan for his successful run at the mayor's office after his release?

'He may not
 be perfect, but he’s perfect for DC.'
