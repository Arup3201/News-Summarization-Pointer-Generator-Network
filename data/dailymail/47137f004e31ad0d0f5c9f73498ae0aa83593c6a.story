Montana neighbors say gold is pouring right out of their water taps, and they're worried that's not all their drinking water contains.

Mark Brown of Whitehall says his wife Sharon was letting out the dishwater after washing up when she noticed something odd - what looked like flakes of gold among the suds.

Sharon called her husband over and they both examined the shiny particles.

'She pulled the plug to let the water out and it was glistening, gleaming little flecks,' Brown told NBC.

They decided that it couldn't possibly be gold, says Brown, but chemical tests proved that the flecks were, in fact, pure gold.

'I can't explain it... It's bizarre,' he said.

The Browns' neighbor Paul Harper says he's also been getting gold in his drinking water.

Whitehall gets its drinking water from two wells in the middle of town, reports NBC Montana.

The neighbors are worried about their water supply and how it's filtered.

'If we're getting heavy metals that you can see with the naked eye,' Brown said, 'what else might be in there?'

The Golden Sunlight gold mine opened about five miles northeast of Whitehall in 1982.

NBC reports that an official with the State Department of Environmental Quality said there's no reason to suspect the gold came from the mine.

The official said he believes the flakes could have come from pipes or pumps tied to the Whitehouse water supply.

A sample has been sent to a lab for testing.
