Murdered: Ferell Benjamin was beaten and scalded with boiling water until he handed over information about his stash of money and drugs. He was then left to die on the floor of the communal toilet

Jurors at the Old Bailey were left in tears today after a gangster whom they had just convicted of torturing a father to death with boiling water yelled at them.

Craig Smith, 23, and Tex Crawford, 20,
are both facing life sentences after they were found guilty of killing 
28-year-old Ferell Benjamin and dumping his body in a hostel toilet.

But the solemn atmosphere of the court turned to drama when a juror tried to storm out of the courtroom as fellow jury members announced they had reached a majority verdict.

The male juror, who cannot be 
identified, was ordered back to his seat by Judge Stephen Kramer QC. But
by then the damage was done.

After
the judge ordered the public gallery, dock and jury box be cleared, uproar broke out and another juror refused to return to court following the interruption.

Others were left in tears after Smith shouted across the courtroom: 'You haven’t been listening to the evidence.

'Ten weeks you’ve been listening to it and you still come back with guilty verdicts. It doesn’t make sense.'

Smith was found guilty by a unanimous verdict while a majority verdict was recorded against Crawford.

The pair abducted Mr Benjamin after tricking their way into his home in Edgware, north London.

The
victim was bundled into the boot of his own car and taken to 
accommodation run by Brent Social Services in Kilburn, northwest London.

Mr Benjamin was then beaten and scalded with boiling water until he handed over information about his stash of money and drugs.

He was then left to die on the floor of the communal toilet - but residents did not alert police until the following day.

Smith
was unanimously convicted of murder, kidnap, false imprisonment and 
conspiracy to rob, while Crawford was found guilty of identical charges 
by a majority verdict of 10-1.

One juror was excused partway through the trial after the ten-week case overran its original time estimate.

Tasheika Campbell, the 22 year-old 
cousin of Mr Benjamin’s partner, also faces years behind bars after 
being convicted of conspiracy to rob. She was cleared of kidnap.

Hostel
resident Samuel Prime-Fearon, 25, walked free from court after he was 
unanimously cleared of murder, manslaughter and false imprisonment.

He
claimed he had been in his room listening to loud music when the 
killing took place and insisted someone else must have let Smith and 
Crawford into the building.

Farce: After Judge Stephen Kramer QC ordered the public gallery, dock and jury box be cleared, uproar broke out and another juror refused to return to court following the interruption.

Smith, Crawford and Campbell will be sentenced on Monday.

Campbell
let the gang into the home of Mr Benjamin and his girlfriend Carlene 
Wellington after making a surprise visit on the afternoon of November 
14, 2010.

‘She went in and talked to Ferell Benjamin,’ Simon Denison QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey.

‘Within minutes of her going inside four men, all wearing masks and gloves, burst in through the front door of the house.’

Ms Wellington’s 12-year-old son arrived home shortly afterwards and was told by Campbell: ‘Go away, something bad is happening.’

The gang then bundled Mr Benjamin into the boot of his car outside the house in Overbrook Walk, Edgware, north London, and drove off.

Mr Benjamin was driven to the hostel in Burton Road and ordered to hand over his mobile phone and the keys to a flat in Acklington Drive on the Grahame Park Estate in Colindale, north London.

His body was discovered the hostel at lunchtime on November 15.

‘Ferell Benjamin was lying face down on the floor in the toilet area of the hostel on the first floor of that building,’ said Mr Denison.

‘His body had in fact been seen there by one of the other residents in the early hours of the morning, but she hadn’t looked closely at him and thought he was sleeping.

‘If she had been looking closely she would have seen he had been stripped naked, apart from his boxer shorts, and his back had been severely scalded by burning liquid - probably boiling water.

‘Blood spattered on the walls around where he lay and pools of blood on the floor beneath him showed he had been beaten and killed in that area. He died from head injuries.’

The police investigation revealed Mr Benjamin was leading a secret life as a class A drug dealer who went by the street names of ‘Kingy’ or ‘Blacks’.

Detectives believe Campbell was recruited by her boyfriend Mustafa Ali, a rival drug dealer, to help stage a robbery.

Ali also took part in the attack on Mr Benjamin but has fled the country. Another suspected kidnapper has never been identified.

Smith, of Rutland Road, Harrow, nw London, and Crawford, of no fixed address, both denied conspiracy to rob, kidnap, false imprisonment and murder and were convicted

Prime-Fearon, of Burton Road, Kilburn, denied false imprisonment and murder and was cleared.

Campbell, of Roxeth Green Avenue, Harrow, denied conspiracy to rob and kidnap.
