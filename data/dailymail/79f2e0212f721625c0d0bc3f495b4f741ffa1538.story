Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs has revealed that Danny Welbeck has been getting stick from his England teammates after switching from 'the northern table to the southern table' while on international duty.

Welbeck left Manchester United for Arsenal in a £16million move on deadline day - where he has been reunited with several England teammates including Gibbs, Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chambelain, Theo Walcott and Calum Chambers

Despite doubts from some Arsenal supporters, Welbeck has not taken long to start scoring goals - including a hat-trick against Galatasaray in the Champions League - and has settled in instantly with his new teammates.

Gibbs revealed: 'Danny's made the switch from the northern table to the southern table at dinners and stuff.

'He's getting a bit of stick from the northern boys but he's been ­properly welcomed to the south.

'Everyone knows each other quite well. There aren't too many new faces. Spirit is good.

'It's very relaxed and there's a feel-good factor in the dressing room. It's fun.' 

Welbeck is set to start in England's next Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia on Sunday, having scored against San Marino in the previous game to maintain the Three Lions perfect start to the group.

Kieran Gibbs has overcome his injury problems to come out of the international wilderness this season

Meanwhile, Gibbs has produced some consistent form this season after seeing his development disrupted by a series of injuries in the past. 

'I have been frustrated in the past with injuries and stuff, but now I am feeling good and strong, so I am happy,' said Gibbs, who spent three years in the international wilderness before being recalled by Roy Hodgson. 

'It is a great honour to be involved.

'I don't think the timing of the injuries helped me. They always seemed to be around the international break, but I am looking forward now and hopefully I can push on from here.'
