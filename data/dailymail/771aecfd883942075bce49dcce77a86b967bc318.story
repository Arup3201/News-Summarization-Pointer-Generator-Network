Usain Bolt has jokingly told Mario Balotelli to 'make a few mistakes' when Liverpool face Manchester United in the Premier League this season.

The Jamaican sprint superstar, who is a huge Red Devils fan, was speaking in an interview with former Newcastle and West Ham goalkeeper Shaka Hislop for ESPNFC.COM, and discussed his meeting with the Italian forward just before he signed for Liverpool last month.

'We were talking and I told him England is the best place [to play football] and when he plays against Manchester United, just make a few mistakes and we’ll be alright,' joked Bolt.

Debutant: Mario Balotelli made his first appearance in a Liverpool shirt against Tottenham last Sunday

Arguably Balotelli's most memorable moment in a Manchester City shirt came when he scored twice at Old Trafford in their 6-1 demolition of United in 2011, revealing his infamous 'Why Always Me?' t-shirt after netting the first goal of the game.

Liverpool have started the season with wins over Southampton and Tottenham sandwiching defeat at Manchester City, whilst Man Utd are still winless this season, having collected just two points so far.

But Bolt remains optimistic in his hopes for his beloved Man Utd under new boss Louis van Gaal.  

'I think Van Gaal means business. It will be hard adapting to his new system but over time the team will improve, as long as we have a strong back three.'

'For me, we need to be back in the top four. Even if we don’t win the league we need to finish in the top four and secure Champions League football, then next season when the team has gelled, there is a better chance of them winning the league.'

The loan deal for Radamel Falcao has been met with great amount of excitement from United fans, but there exists a question mark of where he will fit in alongside the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria.

But Bolt spoke positively of the signing, saying that: 'I met Radamel in Germany and told him “you’re a great athlete” even before I knew he was signing for Man Utd, so I know he is an extremely good goal scorer - and a great addition to the squad.'

Man Utd and Liverpool do not face each other in the Premier League until mid-December, when Brendan Rodgers will take his side to Old Trafford, with the return game at Anfield set to take place in March.
