Two violent convicts on the run from an open prison have been found, police have confirmed.

The 'Scarborough Slasher' Damien Burns, 39, and thief Dean Jackson, 27, escaped from HMP Hatfield, a Category D prison in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, on Monday night.

Police warned the public not to approach either of the men.

Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and Dean Jackson (right), 27, from 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, fled the open prison HMP & YOI 
Hatfield in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, on Monday

Location: Burns was serving an indeterminate sentence for a knifepoint robbery and Jackson was on remand awaiting a sentence for a theft related matter at open prison HMP & YOI Hatfield (pictured) in Doncaster

They walked out just a fortnight 
after Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley fled from an open prison in Kent,
 before being caught four days later.

Today, the Government responded to the latest escape by ruling that prisoners with a history of escaping will
 no longer be placed in open prisons.

It is the latest in a series of 
escapes that has heaped embarrassment on ministers and prompted critics 
to brand the prison service ‘beyond a joke’.

Damien
 Burns, 39, originally from Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and Dean 
Jackson, 27, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, failed to return to the open 
prison HMP & YOI Hatfield in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, on Monday evening.

Officers warned they may have been attempting to make their way back to the areas they originate from as they do not have any known connections in the South Yorkshire region.

Burns was serving an indeterminate 
sentence, since 2007, for a knifepoint robbery and Jackson was on remand
 awaiting a sentence for a theft related matter.

It
came just the day after a murderer who absconded from an open prison 
was arrested after going on the run for the fourth time.

Back in custody: It comes the day after Arnold Pickering (left), a 
convicted murderer, was found, hours after robber Thomas Moffett 
(right) was also recaptured in Blackburn

Armed robber Michael Wheatley, AKA the Skull Cracker, went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison

Arnold Pickering, 44, who stabbed a blind man to death, was held for being unlawfully at large at an address in Oldham.

The killer was recaptured by Greater Manchester Police after failing to return to jail on Saturday afternoon.

The day release programme is 
designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the 
end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training.

But it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed, dangeours criminals.

The
 Government has admitted that more than 1,600 murderers, druglords and 
other hardened criminals were granted day release last year.

Last
 July, Ian McLoughlin (pictured above) was convicted of murdering Graham
 Buck in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while on day 
release.

Murderer Joseph Williams carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010.

And Mark Neville, a drug dealer, spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a £14million cocaine deal.

Last week it was revealed more than 400 killers were kept in open prisons, which have minimal supervision.

Thomas
 Moffett, a violent thief and fellow inmate with Nazi tattoos who was 
also on temporary licence, also absconded on the same day from the same 
prison. Moffett was arrested and is also being held in custody.

Their
 escape comes a fortnight after Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley 
absconded from an open prison and allegedly robbed a building society 
before being caught four days later.

It came after MPs attacked the 'absolute scandal' of murderers being allowed out of prison 'willy nilly'.

In
 1991, a judge said Pickering appointed himself as an ‘executioner’ when
 he decided to kill 53-year-old Thomas Leigh, who was wrongly thought to
 be a paedophile.

He was serving 18 years for that murder when he went missing on Saturday.

His three previous escapes have been from Strangeways in Manchester and 
open prisons in Lancashire and Sussex.

Pickering, 44, and Moffett, 51, 
had been allowed out from HMP Kennet – an open category C prison in 
Maghull, Merseyside – at 9.30am on Saturday. They failed to return as 
agreed at 4.30pm.

Moffett, 
who has swastika tattoos on his arms, was jailed for seven years in 2006
 for a two-month spree of ‘professionally executed robberies’.

He

 threatened shop workers with a nail gun in a series of raids on 
off-licences in Blackburn. He was caught after an employee slipped an 
explosive dye pack into a bundle of cash.

An urgent review is currently taking place into why Wheatley was allowed temporary day release earlier this month.

Burns and Jackson failed to return to HMP Hatfield in Doncaster yesterday evening, and police believe they may be attempting to travel back to their home cities of Scarborough and Newcastle

Despite
 going on the run twice beforehand, the robber was allowed to walk out 
of Standford Hill open prison in Kent where he was serving 13 life 
sentences.

He was eventually
 caught in East London on May 7 after spending almost four days on the 
run and has since been charged with robbing the Chelsea Building 
Society, in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, at gunpoint.

Last
 year, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick said HMP Kennet had 
‘needlessly restrictive’ security for an open prison. Located near 
Liverpool, the prison is home to almost 350 men and is located next to 
Ashworth high security hospital,  which houses Moors murderer Ian Brady.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'Keeping the public safe is our priority and I will not allow the actions of a small minority of offenders undermine public confidence in the prison system

'Absconds have reached record lows under this Government but I take each and every incident seriously.  I have already ordered immediate changes to tighten up the system as a matter of urgency. 

'With immediate effect, prisoners will no longer be transferred to open conditions or allowed out on temporary release if they have previously absconded, and there will also be no unrestricted "town leave" .

'I am clear that open prisons and temporary licence remains an important tool in rehabilitating long term offenders but not at the expense of public safety.'
