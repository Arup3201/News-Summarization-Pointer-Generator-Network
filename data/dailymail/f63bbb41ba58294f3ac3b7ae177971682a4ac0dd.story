A woman was left dead and a man critically injured after a shooting in a Macy’s store car park in San Diego.

The female victim, in her 20s, managed to dial 911 before she died, at around 1.30am on Christmas Eve morning, and explained to the emergency services that she didn’t know where she was.

Both victims had been shot in the head and the upper body as they sat in a car. The woman was later pronounced dead at the scene.
