The family of Sir Jack Brabham has accepted the Queensland government's offer of a state funeral.

The three-time Formula One world champion died at his Gold Coast home on Monday, aged 88.

One of Australia's greatest sportsmen, Brabham was originally from NSW but lived in Queensland for almost 20 years.

Brabham's widow Lady Margaret said the family was delighted by the offer and would meet with Queensland government officials this week to confirm a date and other arrangements.

With two of Brabham's three sons based in the United States and England, the funeral may not be held until next week at the earliest to give them time to travel back to Australia.

'I'm sure he would be so proud and it is an absolute fitting gesture for him. He deserves it,' Lady Margaret told motorsports website Speedcafe.com.

'He is so admired and loved by everybody. He did such a wonderful thing and what he achieved will never be done again.'

The former Royal Australian Air Force mechanic won world titles in 1959 and 1960 with the Cooper Racing Team, and again in 1966 when he became the first driver to win in a car that he built himself.

He was the first motorsport identity to be knighted, after he retired in 1970, and he was awarded Australian of the Year in 1966 and National Treasure in 2012.

Sir Jack, who had 14 Grand Prix wins to his name, won the Formula One World Constructors Championship in 1966 and 1967.

The Australian Grand Prix said Sir Jack died after a long battle with kidney disease.

Sir Jack's wife Lady Margaret said her husband had seemed fine after getting up early and eating breakfast on Monday.

'He had just finished his breakfast and then he was gone,' Lady Margaret told Speedcafe.

'He was fine yesterday so it has been a bit of a shock even though he had been sick for some time.

'I have spoken to all three boys and we are in the process of organising funeral arrangements.'

The rest:

His son David Brabham said it was a very sad day for his family in a statement on Monday.

'My father passed away peacefully at home at the age of 88 this morning,' he said.

'He lived an incredible life, achieving more than anyone would ever dream of and he will continue to live on through the astounding legacy he leaves behind.'

Mr Brabham also tweeted: 'Thanks for all the kind messages about my fathers peaceful passing, it is appreciated by the whole family.'

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has hailed Formula One champion Sir Jack Brabham as an Australian legend.

The 88-year-old boasted many great Australian traits, Mr Abbott said.

'Australia has lost a legend,' Mr Abbott said in a statement.

'He was respected and admired for his spirit, and for his great skill as an engineer.'

Kidney Health Australia CEO Anne Wilson said Sir Jack had suffered from kidney disease and had been on dialysis for a number of years.

'Sir Jack was an inspirational patron for Kidney Health Australia and along with his wife Lady Margaret Brabham, who is also a patron of the organisation, attended many charity events, always keen to promote messages about kidney health,' Ms Wilson said.

'Sir Jack always said that coping with failed kidneys was one of the toughest drives of his life.'

Fellow Australian motor racing legend Alan Jones described Sir Jack, revered throughout the motor racing world, as an inspirational figure.

'I think he was inspirational for any young bloke that wanted to go across overseas and race cars. He was the man they looked up to and he was the man they wanted to emulate,' Mr Jones told Sky News.

The Confederation of Australian Motorsport (CAMS) said the legendary driver, known as 'Black Jack' would never be forgotten.

'Always a man of few words - his nickname 'Black Jack' referred to both his dark hair and his propensity for maintaining a shadowy silence - he avoided small talk and was undemonstrative in the extreme,' a statement on the CAMS website said.

'But behind the wheel he was anything but shy and retiring. He put his head down and drove exceedingly forcefully.'

In addition to his knighthood, Brabham was named Australian of the Year in 1966, a legend of the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2003 and a National Living Treasure in 2012.

V8 Supercars chief executive James Warburton said he led the way for many Australians to succeed on the global stage and for Australia to be recognised as a leader in motorsport.

'He will be forever loved, admired and remembered,' Mr Warburton said.

Sir Jack made his last public appearance on the Sunshine Coast on Sunday, attending an event at the offices of Aeromil Pacific at the Sunshine Coast Airport, where he mixed with motor racing enthusiasts and inspected a car he built and raced during the 1967 Formula Two season.

He had flown by helicopter from his home on the Gold Coast to attend the event, organised by Aeromil Pacific managing director and long-time friend Steve Padgett, who had purchased the Brabham BT23 single seater, still painted in the iconic Brabham green and gold.

'He was certainly a towering figure in motor racing, there's no doubt about that and he was a great Australian,' Mr Padgett told AAP.

'We started it up for him ... he cracked a couple of quite nice smiles which was great,' Mr Padgett said.

In a testament to his character, he famously ran out of fuel on the last lap of the 1959 United States Grand Prix but pushed his car to the finish, securing fourth place and his maiden world title.

In his final years, Sir Jack battled failing eyesight and problems with his kidneys, but he never lost his spark or his sense of humour.

'The big aim now is to die without an enemy in the world. I'm going to outlive the bastards,' he joked.

Brabham is survived by his wife Lady Margaret and his three sons Gary, Geoff and David, who all followed their father into the racing industry.
