Victim: Model Derryn Gaiger, 18, was beaten and mugged by Lauren Simpson, 19, for a cigarette

A young model was mugged for her phone by a teenager who told her 'I'm going to gouge your eyes out' after demanding a cigarette.

Derryn Gaiger, 18, was beaten by Lauren Simpson, 19, from Barry, South Wales, who has been jailed for a year despite being due to give birth next month.

Cardiff Crown Court heard Miss Gaiger had lost modelling assignments because of her injuries and suffers flashbacks and insomnia because of the attack.

On August 8 last year she was walking home in the dark when Simpson confronted her and demanded she handed over a cigarette.

Prosecutor Tracey Lloyd-Nesling told her: 'Simpson grabbed her and repeatedly punched her to the face.

'She put her hand over her mouth to stop her calling for help, held her by the throat and head and threatened to gouge out her eyes.

'Her Blackberry mobile phone was taken in the assault.'

Catalogue model Derryn was treated in hospital for her injuries and later identified Simpson through her Facebook profile.

Mother-to-be Simpson, of Penarth, Cardiff, later admitted actual bodily harm and theft.

Stephen Jeary, for the defence, said a suspended sentence was suitable because she was due to give birth next month.

But Simpson wept in the dock as she was sent to a young offenders' institution for 12 months.

Judge Neil Bidder QC described Simpson as 'a very violent young woman'.

He told her: 'It was a mean offence. You caused your victim to suffer an utterly terrifying experience that she will never forget.

'You recognised your victim's fear, assaulted her repeatedly and threatened to gouge out her eyes' 

He added: 'I regret the fact that you will give birth in custody.'
