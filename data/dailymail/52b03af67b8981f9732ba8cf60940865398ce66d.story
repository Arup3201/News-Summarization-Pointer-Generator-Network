Wigan are in discussions to sign former West Bromwich Albion defender Liam Ridgewell on loan from Portland Timbers.

The 30-year-old made 15 appearances for the MLS side after arriving on a free transfer in the summer.

But with the MLS currently on a break, Ridgewell could hook up with the Championship Latics on a short-term loan until the end of February.

The former Aston Villa and Birmingham man would return to his parent club in time for their annual pre-season tournament as they gear up for the opening fixture against Real Salt Lake on March 7.

Wigan are on a nightmare run of results and are second-bottom of the Championship, three points adrift of safety. 

Ridgewell would remain with the struggling Latics until the end of February
