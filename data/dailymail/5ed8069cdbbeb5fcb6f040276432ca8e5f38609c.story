Tony Hibbert is eager for time on the pitch after the veteran defender signed a new two-year contract with Everton, and hopes a packed fixture list with Europa League football is the way to go about it.

The 33-year-old, a product of Everton's youth academy, has made just 10 appearances in all competitions in the past two years, with injuries and Seamus Coleman leaving him in the cold.

But Hibbert delivered a message to manager Roberto Martinez, declaring himself 'fit and ready to go'.

Everton were pipped by Arsenal for Champions League qualification in fourth last year.

But their fifth-placed finish means European football remains on the agenda.

'I picked up a few injuries (last season) but I'm fit and I'm ready to go,' Hibbert told evertontv.

'Because of the amount of games that we are playing and the way the manager likes to keep people fresh, he might introduce players who haven't played the week before.

'The games will come thick and fast, so it is very important to have a good, strong squad.'

But what about his competition for that right-back spot?

'Seamus has been unbelievable and deserves his place for the way he is playing,' he admitted.

'It's one of them where we need players in the squad that will keep fighting for each other and pushing each other for places.'

Hibbert has been on the books of the Merseyside club since 1991, having joined their youth ranks at the age of 10.
