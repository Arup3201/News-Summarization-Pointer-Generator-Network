David Cameron believes his 'bro-mance' with Barack Obama is so strong it should rank with historic transatlantic pacts forged by Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill.

The Prime Minister concluded a triumphant visit to Washington by paying tribute to the 'special relationship' between Britain and the US – and his personal connection to the man who calls him 'Bro'.

In an interview with American TV, Mr Cameron paid tribute to the 'very strong' bond, adding: 'Whether it was Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, or Churchill and Roosevelt, different relationships have been forged, but the underlying strength of this partnership is there for reasons of not just history, but of values'.

Thatcher's chemistry with Reagan helped cement the Anglo-American union during the 1980s Cold War. Churchill's alliance with Roosevelt was central to victory in the Second World War.

The President used a joint appearance at the White House to lavish praise on the Prime Minister. President Obama, referring to reaction to The Mail on Sunday's disclosure he calls Mr Cameron 'Bro', said: 'Some seemed confused and asked, 'What does Obama mean?'

'So let me put this speculation to rest. Put simply, David is a great friend. He's one of my closest and most trusted partners in the world. On many of the most pressing challenges that we face, we see the world the same way.'

And in his interview, broadcast today on CBS's Face The Nation, Mr Cameron described the threat from Islamic extremists as 'a poisonous death cult narrative, the perversion of one of the world's major religions'.

Mr Cameron said: 'This threat keeps morphing. Whereas the majority of it was coming from the Afghanistan, Pakistan area, now you see more of it coming out of Iraq and Syria. Added to that, you've got 'self-starter' or 'lone-wolf' terrorists, people radicalised because of what they have seen on the internet.'

Mr Cameron challenged the Pope, who said, in the wake of the attack on Charlie Hebdo, that people 'cannot insult the faith of others'. The Prime Minister said: 'I'm a Christian; if someone says something offensive about Jesus, I might find that offensive, but I don't have a right to wreak my vengeance upon them.'

Asked if he had a nickname for the President, Mr Cameron replied: 'I don't, no. And if I did, I probably wouldn't tell you.'
