A High Court judge yesterday blamed ‘modular’ exams brought in by Labour for a fiasco over GCSE grades.

Lord Justice Elias made his comments as he rejected a bid by school leaders, teaching unions and councils to have thousands of English results regraded.

They had argued it was ‘illegitimate grade manipulation’ and ‘a statistical fix’ by the AQA and Edexcel exam boards as they had pushed up grade boundaries.

After the GSCE grading fiasco: Education secretary Michael Gove is currently overhauling the structural reforms that Labour made to GCSEs in 2009 - changes that were judged today as being inherently unfair

But, while he agreed that some students had been treated unfairly, the judge said the fault lay with the qualification.

The case centered on an estimated 
10,000 pupils who sat the exams last June but missed out on a C, the 
minimum  normally needed to go into further education.

The alliance wanted their results to be regraded in line with those from January 2012, when the boundaries were lower.

Labour brought in bite-sized GCSE units in 2009 which could be taken repeatedly.

But in 2010 Education Secretary 
Michael Gove announced they would go. After yesterday’s judgement, he 
demanded that Labour apologise to pupils.

Lord Justice Elias said: ‘I am satisfied that it was indeed the structure of the qualification itself which is the source of such unfairness as has been demonstrated in this case.’

Following the judgment, Education Secretary Michael Gove demanded that Labour politicians apologised to pupils, parents and teachers for the fiasco.

Mr Gove - who announced the removal of modules from GCSEs in the 2010 Schools White Paper - said: ‘Today’s judgement made it clear that the modular structure created the problem with GCSEs.

‘We took action to clear up the mess caused by Labour.’

The judges were told at a hearing in December that an estimated 10,000 pupils who sat English exams last June missed out on a C grade - the minimum grade normally needed to go into further education.

The group of school leaders, teachers and pupils said that the exam boards were to blame because they pushed up the grade boundaries - effectively ‘moving the goalposts’ for pupils.

It said this amounted to ‘illegitimate grade manipulation’ and ‘a statistical fix’ involving exams regulator Ofqual.

Clive Sheldon QC, appearing for the alliance, claimed students had been unjustifiably ‘clobbered’ to meet the Ofqual requirement of no apparent grade inflation.

But in the conclusion to his judgment, Lord Justice Elias, sitting with Mrs Justice Sharp at London’s High Court, said: ‘The problem lies with the modular nature of the examination, coupled with the fact that grade boundaries were assessed and made public at each stage of the process.

Michael Gove said that he was cleaning up Labour's mess after they broke up GCSE into 'bitesize' modules that could be retaken repeatedly as part of his wider education reforms

‘Mr Sheldon was highly critical of this structure. He rightly points out that a high number of experts had predicted precisely the kind of difficulties which have, in fact, arisen.’

He added: ‘I am satisfied that it was indeed the structure of the qualification itself which is the source of such unfairness as has been demonstrated in this case, and not any unlawful action by either Ofqual or the AOs (exam boards).’

He dismissed the alliance’s application for a judicial review, but said the issue had caused an outcry and was a ‘matter of widespread and genuine concern properly brought to court’.

Lawyers for the alliance had argued for the June exams to be regraded in line with those taken in January when the boundaries were lower.

But Edexcel and AQA said they had behaved properly and Ofqual argued it had acted in a ‘clear, principled and transparent way’.

The Association of School and College Leaders yesterday described the ruling as ‘very disappointing’ but said the judge had recognised that pupils had been treated ‘unfairly’.

A spokesman for the AQA exam board said the ruling ‘confirmed that we set the right grade boundaries for GCSE English last summer’.

He added: ‘In the judges’ view, the main reason schools did not get the results they expected was the modular structure of the qualification.’

A Department for Education spokesman said the dispute showed the GCSE system has been in need of fundamental reform.

Balls up: Ed Balls, left, was education secretary when Labour changed the GCSE structure in 2009. The present Conservative education secretary Michael Gove, right, has insisted Balls apologise for the 'unfair' reforms

He said: ‘We are now making further reforms to GCSEs, including overhauling league tables so they are fair to schools and pupils, and still give parents and the public the information they need.

‘The judgement demonstrates that overall Ofqual got it right last year.’

The government in Wales has already intervened to re-grade some GCSE English results.

In a report last November, Ofqual concluded that January’s GCSE English assessments, which accounted for about 10 per cent of entries, had been ‘graded generously’.

However, the June boundaries had been properly set and candidates’ work had been accurately graded.
