Thousands of runners took part in the Reading Half Marathon in soaring temperatures today. 

More than 18,000 participants took on the 13.1 mile Berkshire race, which has been described as 'flatter and faster' than previous years.

The race was won by Stephen Amos Kiplagat from Kenya, who completed the course in just over one hour, three minutes and ten seconds.

The first woman to cross the finishing line was 24-year-old Lily Partridge, who completed her first ever half marathon in one hour, ten minutes and 32 seconds.

The sunny weather got the better of some runners, with several being taken to medical tents and one man, in his 30s, collapsing near the finishing line, Reading Chronicle reports. 

The man was treated by medical staff and is believed to have made a full recovery.

Runners today wore everything from tu-tus to Fred Flintstone costumes and looked sweltering in the warm conditions.

The Reading route is generally see as of the fastest in the country and is always incredibly popular as it falls five weeks before the London Marathon.

 The first ever Reading Half Marathon was organised and run in 1983, when the start and finish venue was Reading University at White Knights Park. 

There were 5,000 runners and it was won by a 21 year old local University student, Mark Curzons in a time of one hour, seven minutes and forty-five seconds.
