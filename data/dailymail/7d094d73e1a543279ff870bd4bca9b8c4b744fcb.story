Ryder Cup winner Lee Westwood has criticised the United States team for airing 'dirty laundry in public' after their defeat at Gleneagles last month.

In the immediate wake of Europe's 16 1/2 to 11 1/2 victory, American veteran Phil Mickelson openly criticised the captaincy of Tom Watson, sat a few feet away from him, at the post-tournament press conference.

That has led to a fortnight of apologies, inquests and soul-searching about what can be done to end the European dominance of the event.

The USA team were convincingly beaten by Europe in the 2014 Ryder Cup 

'I think it's a little bit disappointing to see the dirty laundry being out in public,' said Westwood, back on American soil playing in the PGA Tour's Frys.com Open in California this week.

'It's very difficult to pin-point in a team environment whose fault it specifically is.

'It's a combination of a lot of different things. Maybe Tom got a few things wrong. Maybe the US team just didn't quite play well enough in general. You know, if the other team plays well, you're going to lose.

'I'm just pleased that I don't have to sort it all out because I don't like to see people's great reputations being brought down by something that shouldn't really happen in public.

'It should all be done behind closed doors and sorted out there, and the analysis should start there, really, and not be done in the press, in the media.'

Westwood was part of the team which lost at Valhalla in 2008 and while there were a number of issues with Nick Faldo's captaincy then no-one in the European team broke ranks with their frustrations.

'I think there were a lot of people disappointed in '08 but we tried to come together and basically not say anything in public,' added Westwood at his pre-tournament press conference.

'Whenever you lose you're going to be disappointed and you're going to think things could have been done better.

Phil Mickelson, speaking in a press conference after Europe has secured victory at Gleneagles, claimed American captain Tom Watson had 'strayed from a winning formula' and compared his unfavourably to 2008 leader Paul Azinger.

He said: 'There were two things that allowed us to play our best that Paul Azinger did.

'First, he got everybody invested in the process. He got everybody invested in who they were going to play with, who the picks were going to be, who was going to be in their 'pod', when they would play, and they had a great leader for each pod. We hung out together.

'The other things that Paul did really well was he had a game plan for us - how we were going to go about doing this, how we were going to go about playing together, if so-and-so is playing well, if so-and-so is not playing well.

'Those two things helped us bring out our best golf. We use that same process in the Presidents Cup and we do really well.

'Unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three Ryder Cups and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best.'

Asked if he believed his comments were disloyal to Watson, he replied: 'I'm sorry you're taking it that way. I'm just talking about what Paul Azinger did to help us play our best.'

'It's just a case of managing it and handling it and improving it for the next time professionally.

'Certainly for the future Ryder Cups the Europeans will remember how it's all been handled.

'The European team will remember the fall-out from this one. It can't do anything but build confidence for the European team going into the next one that it's been handled so publicly this time.

'I guess we'll see how easy it is to get the US team rattled by putting a bit of pressure on them. I don't think anything good can come of all this (for the Americans).'

In response to all of the recent discussion about our Ryder Cup loss, I would like to make a few comments.

First, I take complete and full responsibility for my communication, and I regret that my words may have made the players feel that I didn't appreciate their commitment and dedication to winning the Ryder Cup.

My intentions throughout my term as captain were both to inspire and to be honest.Secondly, the guys gave everything.They played their hearts out. I was proud to get to know each and every one of them. I know they are all going to win tournaments, be on future Ryder Cup teams and have wonderful careers.

Our team certainly showed guts when it took it to the other team early in Sunday's singles matches. We were indeed tied with them as the scoreboard turned wonderfully "red". Our players started fast as I had asked them to in my comments the night before. I asked them to really concentrate on holes 2-5, as the Europeans had won too many early battles on these particular holes. But in the end, the facts are that the other team played better. My hat's off and congratulations to them.

As for Phil's comments, I completely understand his reaction in the moment. Earlier this week I had an open and candid conversation with him and it ended with a better understanding of each other's perspectives. Phil's heart and intentions for our team's success have always been in the right place. Phil is a great player, has great passion and I admire what he's done for golf.

The bottom line is this. I was their captain. In hindsight whatever mistakes that were made were mine. And I take complete and full responsibility for them. I want to say again to the players, their families, the PGA and our country how proud and honored I was to captain this talented group of golfers, and how privileged I was to spend the past two years working this labor of my love for the Ryder Cup.

Matt Kuchar, a member of the losing team at Gleneagles, said he had avoided everything to do with defeat since returning home.

'I played the Ryder Cup and then haven't turned on the TV since I was home. I've watched some football games and some baseball games, but I don't look online to see anything,' he said.

'Phil answered a question. It didn't seem like it was at all a shot at Tom Watson to me.

'Phil was asked the last time the US won they had a pod system under Paul Azinger, 'Why do you think they went away from the system, did you prefer the system?' and Phil said 'Yeah'.

'With that I guess it opened up a can of worms but you've got to remember Phil being asked a second question, and he said 'Listen, don't take it that way. This is not a shot at Tom', so I'm sure it's blown out of proportion.'
