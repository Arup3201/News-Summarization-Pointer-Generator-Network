The UK Independence Party could help form the next government, leader Nigel Farage claimed today.

Despite not having a single MP in Parliament, Mr Farage claimed his party’s trajectory could mean he plays the role of deciding who becomes Prime Minister in the event of another hung parliament.

The extraordinary boast comes as David Cameron tries to see off the electoral threat posed by the Eurosceptic party with a landmark speech in the Netherlands on Tory policy for Britain’s future relationship with Brussels.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage claimed he could help form a coalition in the event of another hung parliament in 2015

Tensions have been growing between the Conservatives and UKIP after Mr Farage’s party’s poll ratings soared, reaching 16 per cent in a poll yesterday – up from 4.5 per cent a year ago.

Mr Cameron yesterday branded UKIP 'pretty odd people' in a fresh attack which Mr Farage had suggested would make an electoral pact before polling day impossible.

But the UKIP boss said that if the progress in the polls continues, he could help form the next government if there was another hung parliament.

‘Don’t think about UKIP forming the government in 2015 but if we continue at anything like our current progress, who knows?

‘The “first-past-the-post” system is brutal to a party like us, we’ve got a lot of work to do on that and to build up our stronger areas, but who’s to say that in 2015 UKIP may well be needed in a coalition?’

However, he warned against getting carried away by good poll ratings. ‘When David Steel said to the Liberal party “go home and prepare for government”, it made him a laughing stock and people are still laughing at him about that now.

‘We’ve got to keep our feet on the ground. We are making progress, we’re not yet a party that is poised to take government in this country,' he told BBC Radio 4.

‘We are a voice for good, ordinary people in this country, we are not hidebound by political correctness, we’ve proved ourselves to be great campaigners, let’s see how the UKIP story evolves.’

David Cameron took a swipe at UKIP supporters, branding them 'pretty odd people' as former Labour minister Lord Mandelson warned putting a question mark over Britain's EU membership was 'economically insane'

UKIP are predicted to win the European Parliament elections in 2014 and beaten both Tory and Lib Dem candidates in by-elections.

A Survation survey for the Mail on Sunday put Labour on 38 per cent, the Tories on 29, UKIP on 16 and the Lib Dems on 11.

Translated
into votes at the  next General Election, that would cost the 
Conservatives 51 seats and present Labour with a thumping victory and an
overall majority of 94.

Mr Cameron renewed his attack on UKIP yesterday, saying it contains some ‘pretty odd people’.

He spoke as a poll suggested that the anti-Brussels party is enjoying record support, at 16 per cent, taking third place from the Lib Dems.

Asked yesterday on the BBC about his previous description of UKIP supporters as ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’, Mr Cameron said: ‘There are some pretty odd people.’

But Mr Farage hit back: 'Do I want a party where we've got some eccentrics and occasionally someone causes us an embarrassment – or do I want a party made up of a bland lot of ghastly people whose names I don't even know?

'I'm in politics, and I've never heard of half the MPs who come on the telly. I meet them at cocktail parties and after 30 minutes I can't remember their name,' he told The Guardian.

The Prime Minister is expected to give a major speech on repatriating powers from Brussels in the Netherlands before the end of the month.

He will rule out the idea of leaving the EU to become a trading partner, like Norway, and instead advocate using moves by eurozone countries towards closer integration to bring powers back to London.

The 'fresh settlement' would then be put to British voters in a referendum.

But today former Labour Business Secretary Lord Mandelson, an ex-European commissioner, warned the Prime Minister not to think he can '"put a gun' to the heads of EU leaders over repatriating powers.

In an article for the Guardian he wrote: 'The Prime Minister seems to think he can only pacify his party by conceding to anti-Europeans their long coveted referendum.

'I think his hopes for buying peace will be disappointed. The Tories risk dividing into irreconcilable factions, those who want to adjust the terms of Britain's EU membership in order to stay in, and those who will do everything they can to get Britain out.

'That's what happens when madness takes over a political party. Ask anyone who was in the Labour party in the 1980s.

'Beginning 2013 by placing this large and indefinite question mark over our membership of the EU, and all the trade and investment privileges it brings us, can only be described as economically insane.'
