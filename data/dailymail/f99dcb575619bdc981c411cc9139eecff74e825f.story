An 'incompetent' learner driver left a trail of destruction outside a school after crashing into three cars and a bollard as she rushed to a chemist.

Diabetic Kaneez Butt-Zeeshan drove alone to pick up medication when she had low blood sugar, even though she was unqualified to do so.

Bristol Crown Court heard that, after smashing into a car, she panicked and reversed into it again before slamming into a parked car, torpedoing a moving van and finally destroying a bollard.

Dangerous: Diabetic Kaneez Butt-Zeeshan ride of destruction began outside Victoria Park Junior School on Atlas Road in Bristol when she drove into a car twice

The non-English speaker was arrested and gave police a prepared statement in which she conceded she drove off in panic as her first victim got out of his car.

She admitted making a series of wrong judgements and was truly sorry.

The mother-of-two, aged 25, from Bristol pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and driving without a licence or insurance.

Judge Michael Longman told her: 'You simply shouldn’t have been driving that car at all.

'You are an incompetent driver, you haven’t got a full driving licence.

'The result is you were not insured to drive that car and you appear to have been in a hurry, for whatever reason.'

The judge recognised it was a short distance of significant damage in which, luckily, no-one was hurt.

He handed Butt-Zeeshan a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months.

Panic: After ramming a parked car, she then sped to the top of the road and careered around the corner into Raymend Road

She was told to observe a 16-week tagged curfew in which she must stay at home from 8pm and 6am. She was also banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to take an extended driving test.

Butt-Zeeshan was also told to pay £250 prosecution costs, instead of the brunt falling on public funds.

Robert Reid, prosecuting, said it was 4.30pm when, just as parents were collecting youngsters from Victoria Park Junior School, Butt-Zeeshan was on Atlas Road heading to the chemist in her red Nissan Micra.

Mr Reid said: 'Matters started off in Atlas Road when the defendant reversed into the front of a black Clio.

'The driver got out and indicated that he wanted to exchange details.

'She reversed a second time into the black Clio.'

Out of control: Driving at high speed to the junction of Raymend Road and St. John's Lane she torpedoed a white van before reversing into - and destroying - a bollard

The court heard Butt-Zeeshan stopped 
at the side of the road, followed by the Clio, but she then reversed 
into a Seat car and continued to drive up Atlas Road.

Mr Reid said: 'Witnesses said she was traveling excessively fast.

'She turned right down Raymend Road to the junction with St John’s Lane. That resulted in her car being embedded in the white van.'

Butt-Zeeshan attempted to reverse away but was initially unsuccessful.

Having freed her car from the tangle she reversed back, flattening a bollard at the corner of the road.

Mr Reid said: 'Her husband came and there was a confrontation between various parties.

'One witness reported the headmaster of the school being directed by police to usher children away from the scene.'

In her prepared statement to police, the learner driver conceded her catalogue of errors and wrote: 'I will not drive alone until I have the correct documents.'

Butt-Zeeshan sobbed as Catherine Spedding, defending, said: 'There was the first collision and she panicked.

'She was in a difficult state. She had gone to the chemist to collect her medication. Her blood sugar was low at the time.'

Miss Spedding said her client took insulin as well as tablets for diabetes, which was picked up during her pregnancy five years ago.

Miss Spedding told the court: 'She was having treatment. She went to the chemist for medication. She was driving on a provisional licence, taking driving lessons.

'She foolishly decided to leave home and drive the car. She accepts she has done wrong and this is a salutary lesson for her.'
