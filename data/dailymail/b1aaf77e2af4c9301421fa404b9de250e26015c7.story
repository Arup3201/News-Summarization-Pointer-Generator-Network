Global demand for luxury British brands including Jimmy Choo and Burberry could help drag the UK out of the economic gloom, Vince Cable claimed today.

The Business Secretary plans to cash in on a shopping boom in China, Brazil and India to promote the cream of British fashion and design, including Aspinal of London, Hackett London and Turnbull and Asser.

While the UK high street is in the doldrums, exports of some of the country’s biggest brands are soaring. By 2015 global demand for luxury goods is expected to soar by almost 60 per cent.

Mr Cable wants to make it easier for firms to sell their clothes and accessories online, targeting ‘the rapidly growing number of middle class consumers in priority markets where British luxury brands are highly prized’.

Ministers have pinpointed Mumbai, Beijing, Istanbul, St Petersburg, Shanghai, Mexico City, Sao Paulo and Warsaw as key markets.

A two-year GREAT Britain campaign will be launched in China, Hong Kong, Brazil, India, Russia and Mexico.

The Shanghai F1 Grand Prix next month
will see the start of a ‘British Luxury in China’ campaign, which will 
also tour 11 other Chinese cities in the next year.

Similar weeks are planned in Mumbai and Dubai, as well as in Milan, New York, Paris and London.

The retail sector in the UK already employs more than 3million people and generates more than £300billion every year.

Britain is also among the world leaders in internet shopping, with 228,000 online retailers already exporting more than the rest of Europe’s e-retailers put together.

Mr Cable believes more can be done to promote the likes of Jimmy Choo, Asprey and Turnbull and Asser in key markets, which will potentially mean more jobs in the UK.

Speaking at an event in London today, Mr Cable said: ‘The Government is banging the drum for these great British companies across the globe.

‘Our campaign to promote these brands from China to Brazil will help companies to export and manufacture more, creating jobs across the UK.’

Government agency, UK Trade and Investment, is also planning to ‘redouble its efforts’ in the traditional luxury brand markets.

Ministers want to harness the growing middles classes in emerging markets, and persuade them to buy British before other brands dominate.

Other well-known firms to have signed up include Marks & Spencer, TM Lewin, Boots, Tesco, The White Company and Waitrose.

Mr Cable added: ‘The retail sector adds much to London’s distinctive edge, drawing in millions of tourists every year.

‘It’s vital that we get out and sell the message that capital is open for business and welcomes international investment,’ he said as he launched the UK Retail Industry International Action Plan at Retail Week Live in London.

London is the shopping capital of the world, and ministers hope the ad campaign will persuade more overseas shoppers to buy British

In a speech at Retail Week Live, Business Secretary Vince Cable vowed to bang the drum for British brands around the world

Chocolate store Hotel Chocolat is among those planning to expand its UK manufacturing base to grow its base in the US and Europe while Waitrose now has products in 35 countries, including new markets such as Chile, Lebanon and Gibraltar.

Bosideng, one of China’s leading clothing, recently opened a £35million store in central London. With more than 11,000 shops worldwide, it now has a dedicated London collection, designed by its UK design team and mostly made in the UK and Europe.

Helen Dickinson, Director General of the British Retail Consortium, said:  ‘British retail is world class and given the opportunity can be more successful in markets across the globe.’
