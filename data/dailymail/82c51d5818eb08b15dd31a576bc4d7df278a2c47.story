The E-Njoint is said to be 'harmless and 100 per cent legal'

A Dutch company has invented the world's first electronic joint.

E-Njoint
 BV is selling its high-tech spliffs at parties, music events, bars and clubs and across Europe.

Currently 10,000 e-joints per day are being manufactured by the company in China.

Its
 design has the typical shape of a joint and a green cannabis leaf 
lights up through the chrome plated tip each time the user takes a puff.

One
particular variety of the E-Njoint is disposable and contains no THC, tobacco or 
nicotine, making it 'harmless and 100 percent legal,' according to the 
makers.

Instead, it turns so-called 'safe components', such as natural 
Propylene Glycol, Vegetable Glycerin and 100 per cent biological flavor, into water vapour.

But
 other models can be smoked as real electric joints.

The E-Njoint 
Rechargeable can be filled by users with their own cannabis liquid 
content.

The product, which comes in six different flavours including watermelon, passion fruit, green apple and red cherry, costs just over £7 per joint.

The company's website, which lists the outlets in Europe where you can buy e-joints, claims that smoking can be  'healthy', describing the E-Njoint as the 'the latest trend on the market.'

E-Njoint is in discussions with Tikun 
Olam, a business specialising in medicinal marijuana, to help produce 
products for the health industry.

How different governments in Europe react to the e-joint has yet to be seen.

'Holland
 is well known in the world for its tolerant and liberal attitude toward
 soft drugs and the introduction of this new product clearly makes a 
statement,' said Menno Contant, CEO of E-Njoint. 

'As long as you don't bother or disturb other people and stay 
within the legal boundaries, all is well,' he claims. 

He added: 'Everyone should feel fine, because what we are doing is no crime.'
