He's the former child star turned documentary maker and now Tyger Drew-Honey has set his sights on explaining why modern men are coming under increasing pressure to look good.

In the latest episode of his BBC3 series, Tyger Takes On..., Drew-Honey, 18, meets the boys and men going to extreme lengths to look good, whether that means surgery or steroids.

'One guy I met was Marcus who had taken so many 
steroids that he had had a heart attack at 18,' reveals the star, incredulous.

'He didn’t want to show us his body because he felt ashamed of it
 but I looked at it on Instagram later and he was ripped.

'He had an 
amazing body and it seemed mental that he thought there was something 
wrong with that.'

And it's not just insecurities about muscle mass that plagues British men. According to eating disorders charity beat, males make up anywhere between 10 per cent and a quarter of anorexia and bulimia sufferers.

So why are men going to extreme lengths to look good? According to Drew-Honey, natural competitiveness should bear some of the blame.

'It’s this idea of being competitive,' explains the 18-year-old star. 'We 
see all these pictures of underwear models and pictures on the Instagram
 because, essentially, we communicate through pictures these days.

Pressure: Men's bodies are coming under the same sort of scrutiny as women's do

'We are 
all in a race and we’re gonna go mad. We get more and more competitive 
and then eventually we are in competition with ourselves.'

Making it worse, he reveals, is the celebrity selfie culture which projects an ideal that the majority of teenagers and twenty-somethings will never achieve.

'People use this selfie culture 
as a way of advertising themselves,' he adds, 'and people constantly feel have to live up 
to the perfection that they see on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram more
 and more.'

What's more, this is one teen trend that isn't just about impressing the girls. 'There is that idea of looking good for 
the opposite sex but a lot of the time men want to impress other men,' explains Drew-Honey.

'When I was hanging around with the boys in Coventry [for the documentary], they said they 
didn’t care what the women thought - they only cared about what the men said and not 
because they were gay but because of their competitive nature.'

And Drew-Honey himself isn't immune to the lure of a ripped pair of abs. 'I think my main insecurities are with my
 body,' he confesses.

'My body is 
alright, I watch what I eat and try not to eat loads but I enjoy the 
odd bit of chocolate. But I don’t do masses [of exercise] although I do walk my dog.'

Less charitable types might be inclined to write off the sufferings of men as nothing much - particularly in light of the pressure that women have suffered for years.

Drew-Honey, however, says this is missing the point. 'I think that the issue 
with women was right to be addressed because of 
all the issues that followed size zero models and so on contributing anorexia and 
bulimia.

'But men’s insecurities need to be addressed too because there are a
 lot of issues with guys taking loads of steroids and visiting the gym 
constantly.

He adds: 'I think if there was a boy or a girl who didn’t have any 
insecurities that would be ridiculous - everybody feels insecure 
sometimes and I don’t think anyone will ever be completely happy with 
how they look.'
