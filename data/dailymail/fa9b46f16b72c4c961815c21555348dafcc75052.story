If ordinary Americans voted
for the Academy Awards, American Sniper would win Best Picture by a landslide, the annual Oscars poll has revealed.

Clint Eastwood's movie starring Bradley Cooper as the late Navy SEAL Chris
Kyle was cited by 22 per cent of respondents as the movie that
should win the top Oscar among the eight nominees. 

The Martin Luther King Jr. biopic Selma was the second
most popular choice with 8 per cent.

The people's favorite: American Sniper scored an overwhelming majority of votes to win Best Picture

According to the online survey run by Reuters and Ipsos from January 16-23, Boyhood, the coming-of-age story filmed over 12 years with
the same actors, was third in
the survey with 4 per cent.

Nearly half, or 48 per cent, said they were unsure which film
should win best picture.

Both American Sniper and Selma have been the subject of
controversy in recent weeks.

The Eastwood-directed film, currently No 1 at the North
American box office, has become a flashpoint of debate between
liberals and conservatives over the morality of war and the role
of snipers.

Selma drew criticism from some historians for what they
said was a misleading portrayal of President Lyndon B. Johnson's
role in the fight for voting rights for blacks.

Second place: Selma, the biopic of Martin Luther King Jr, came second in the vote with eight per cent

It was also at the center of the upheaval over the lack
of diversity in the Oscar nominations announced last week, which
excluded the film's African-American female director and lead
actor.

The survey revealed, however, that many people have not seen
the year's top films and Oscar contenders.

The film seen most by those surveyed was Gone Girl, the
film adaptation of the best-selling thriller that did not
receive a best picture nomination. Twelve per cent have seen that
film.

American Sniper and musical Into the Woods, were the
second most seen at 9 per cent each.

Worth the wait? It seems the 12-year project Boyhood also paid off, earning third place in the eyes of viewers

The two films that lead all Academy Awards nominees with
nine nods a piece, the whimsical caper The Grand Budapest
Hotel and the dark satire Birdman, have been seen by 8
per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.

A full 65 per cent of respondents had not seen any of the 15
films cited in the survey.

The Oscars, to be presented at a ceremony on February 22, will
be voted on by the 6,100 members of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 2,385 Americans online and
has a credibility interval of plus or minus 2.3 percentage
points.
