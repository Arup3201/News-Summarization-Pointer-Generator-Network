Real estate agents listed the full-brick Seaforth home, in northern Sydney, as an 'idyllic blank canvas'.

The outdated three-bedroom residence was built on 1069sqm of land and not a cent was spent on the home since it was built in the 1950s.

A neighbour told the Manly Daily that the owner barely lived with no electricity for years and barely used the kitchen as he ate only cold food like tinned peas.

The derelict kitchen even had an 'Early Kooka' gas stove while the bathroom was in its original retro mint condition.
