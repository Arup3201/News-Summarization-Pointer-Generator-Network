It's a  feast fit for a king, kicking off with two snifters of Richard Hennessy cognac before following on with prized Ossetra caviar, Kobe steak, white truffle mash and Chateau d'Yquem wine.

But at an eye-watering $21,000 (£13,500), it's certainly not a meal everyone will be able to afford.

The extravagant dinner features on the New Year's Eve menu at Empire Steak House in New York City, according to JustLuxe. 

New York City's Empire Steak House is ringing in the New Year with its $21,000 sumptuous spread

The starter, which will be served with a bottle of Dom Perignon Oenotheque, comprises four ounces of Platinum Ossetra Caviar and a seafood platter with lobster, crab, clams, oysters, and tuna tartar.

The main event is an eight-ounce Grade A5 Kobe rib eye steak imported from Japan with white truffle mashed potatoes and black truffle creamed spinach, paired with a bottle of Chateau Petrus.

The lavish meal ends with a creme brulee infused with Taylor Fladgate’s 1964 Single Harvest Port, and half a bottle of Château d'Yquem.

After dinner, diners will be served glasses of Taylor Fladgate’s 1964 Single Harvest Port with various cheeses.  

Ossetra caviar eggs have a nutty and fruity flavour

There are several types of caviar but true gourmet caviar comes from only from the sturgeon fish  - primarily Beluga, Osetra, and Sevruga sturgeons

Beluga caviar is the most expensive in the world. It has large roe which ranges in colour from black to pale grey with a smooth, buttery flavour. 

Also spelled Osetra, Oscietra or Asestra, Ossetra caviar's medium-sized eggs have a nutty and slightly fruity flavour. Their colour ranges from golden brown to light grey. 

Sevruga caviar is more plentiful than Beluga and Ossetra and as such is the least expensive. Its roe is small and ranges in colour from black to very light grey. It has a salty, rich and intense flavour. 

Fine caviar is rated according to the size and color of its roe, its method of processing, and colour. Very light roe is known as Royal caviar and was once reserved only for royalty. The largest remaining deposit of sturgeon is in the Caspian Sea, shared by Russian and Iranian producers, where 85 per cent of today's wild caviar originates.

Not the first time: The restaurant made headlines last year for its $10,000 five-course festive menu 

The lucky duo will be given $1,000 (£640) in gift certificates for future dinners when their costly meal ends. 

The restaurant also has a more affordable New Year's Eve tasting menu at $99 (£63) per person.

It made headlines last year for its $10,000 (£6,400) five-course festive menu which offered guests lobster cooked in Champagne and a three-layer chocolate and raspberry tart with gold leaf and Cognac.
