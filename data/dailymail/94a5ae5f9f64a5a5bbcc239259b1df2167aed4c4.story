Arizona’s infamous Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now defending one of his famous friends after controversy caused by comments made at a roast in his honor.

State Senator John Kavanagh made racially charged jokes at Arpaio’s expense during the recent roast since the sheriff is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration.

A recording of the roast made public has caused outrage after the state lawmaker was heard insulting Hispanics to draw laughs from guests.

On the hot seat: Maricopa County (AZ) Sheriff Joe Arpaio is no stranger to controversy

‘Sheriff Joe is the kind of guy that you gotta love, as long as you have papers,’ Kavanaugh can be heard saying on the recording made public by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

‘Going out with Joe is always an adventure,’ he adds as the audience laughs, ‘because usually when we walk into a restaurant, most of the waitstaff and cooks dive out the back window, and when they don't, I never know what the hell's in my food.’

Those jokes and several similar quips have put Arpaio in the uneasy position of defending a man he calls a friend.

Controversial: State Sen John Kavanaugh's remarks may have drawn chuckles from his audience, but not everyone is laughing

‘How many Hispanics did you pull over on the way over here, Arpaio, huh?’ Kavanuagh jokes.

Kavanaugh also joked about the federal monitor appointed to oversee the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office by a judge to limit racial profiling.

‘Just to show you how unreasonable the federal monitor is.. when Sheriff Joe sends his new deputies to the academy, he will no longer just train them to do the Miranda warning in Spanish, he will have to teach it in English too’ Kavanaugh wisecracks.

‘The sign over the booking intake door in the jail will have to have ‘welcome’ and just not ‘bienvenido,’ he continues.

Arpaio can be heard around this point saying ‘that’s enough,’ but the state senator continued a bit longer before bidding the roaring crowd ‘adios.’

‘It was a roast. John Kavanagh's my friend. I support him. He's not a racist. He's very funny,’ Arpaio told CNN. ‘So, he made these comments, I can't speak whether he went too far.’

But others, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, say Kavanaugh did push things too far, accusing the sheriff and his cohorts of continuing to ‘dehumanize immigrants and treat Latinos like second-class citizens.’

Kavanaugh declined to comment, but released a statement to the network calling the jokes 'satirical' and 'not directed at minority group members but at the target of the roast - Sheriff Arpaio.'

He accused the SPLC of editing out non-racially-tinged portions of the roast and said that the jokes were 'typical of roasts and had I made the same jokes against Sheriff Arpaio at their annual dinner.'

He did not offer any apology for those who may have been offended by the comments.

Arpaio tried changing the tables on his detractors during the CNN interview, asking where the outrage was when he was being called ‘Nazi and Hitler.’

‘Why isn't there an uproar about going after me, calling me every name in the book? Why are they worried about just some roast?’ He asked.

Disallowed from racially profiling suspects to ask for immigration papers, Arpaio has come up with other ways to keep himself occupied including issuing pink underwear to county inmates and taking salt and pepper from their food, according to his office.

Last month, he put several inmates on a bread and water diet for defacing American flags in their cells while at the same time piping patriotic music into county detention centers.
