New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Tuesday that he has 'absolute confidence' in the president of Rutgers University even as some lawmakers have called for Robert Barchi to step down amid a string of embarrassing revelations for the university's athletic department.

Christie said he doesn't want to micromanage the university and won't say whether incoming athletic director Julie Hermann should start at the school as scheduled on June 17.

'Not my call,' he said Tuesday during his monthly call-in show on TownSquare Media. 'I'm confident in President Barchi's judgment.'

Since Sunday, there have been 
revelations that volleyball players at Tennessee complained that Hermann
abused them verbally and emotionally when she coached there in the 
1990s and that she was involved in a sexual discrimination lawsuit while
she was an administrator at Louisville.

Confidence: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Tuesday that he has 'absolute confidence' in the president of Rutgers University

'Let's not engage in the character 
assassination that's going on here,' said Christie, who said he does not
know and has not met Hermann. 'I understand that there are some people 
that feel differently about it. It doesn't matter. What matters is: what
did the administration at Rutgers believe?'

Some lawmakers, including likely 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Sen. Barbara Buono, have questioned 
whether Barchi is fit to lead the state's flagship university.

'I have lost all confidence in 
President Barchi's ability to effectively guide our state university,' 
Buono said in a statement Tuesday.

The earlier episodes from Hermann's 
career are particularly troubling for Rutgers, which hired her after 
former basketball coach Mike Rice was fired in April for physically and 
verbally abusing players and former athletic director Tim Pernetti was 
forced to resign for his handling of the problem. The university's top 
in-house lawyer and an assistant basketball coach also resigned during 
the fallout.

The New York Times first reported on 
details of the Louisville suit which Mary Banker, a former assistant 
men's and women's track coach, filed against the University of 
Louisville Athletic Association, saying she was let go in 2008 after she
brought allegations of sex and gender discrimination to Hermann and 
then human resources. Hermann was the executive senior associate 
athletic director for Louisville at the time.

Hermann testified at a 2010 trial in 
the case. A jury found in Banker's favor, awarding her $300,000 for 
mental and emotional distress. But the university appealed and the 
Kentucky Court of Appeals overturned the verdict in February.

The appellate ruling said that, 'even 
in a light most favorable to Banker,' Louisville proved Hermann and the 
head track coach, Ron Mann, 'had contemplated, if not decided, not to 
renew Banker's contract prior to Banker's complaint to HR.'

The case is now before the Kentucky Supreme Court, which has not yet decided whether to take it.

In addition to news of the sex 
discrimination lawsuit, a member of the Rutgers' athletic director 
search committee said she was dumbfounded that the firm hired to vet 
potential candidates for the athletic director's job never uncovered 
allegations by former Tennessee women's volleyball players that Hermann 
verbally abused them while she was their coach. The Star-Ledger reported
the claims for Sunday editions.

'One of the primary reasons for using a
search firm is that they're supposed to completely vet a candidate for a
senior management position, so I'm a little mystified as to why this 
comes from the press and not the search committee,' said Susan Schurman,
dean of the School of Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers, who 
was on the search committee but out of the country for much of the 
process.

Yet the embattled athletic director 
also found some allies. A retired Tennessee official and a former 
graduate assistant each voiced support for Hermann during her tenure 
with the Vols.

Joan Cronan, women's athletic director
emeritus at Tennessee, said in a statement that she holds Hermann in 
high regard, and that while the ex-coach's tenure in the 1990s 'was a 
very frustrating time for everyone connected with the volleyball 
program, I do not recall it being an abusive situation.'

Hermann denied having knowledge of a 
letter players say they submitted to the school. She acknowledged she 
made mistakes, but says she has matured and believes she is qualified to
lead Rutgers.

'I believe she is well-prepared for 
her new role at Rutgers University,' Cronan wrote. 'After Julie's sixth 
season as the head volleyball coach, I decided that a change was needed,
and I moved Julie to a position in athletics administration.'

Angry: The video, which was screened by ESPN, showed several moments when Mr Rice angrily pushed, shoved and grabbed his players during practices

Admission: Tim Pernetti, pictured right with Rice, has admitted that his decision to suspend Rice in December - and not fire him - was the wrong move

Marc Gesualdo, a graduate assistant 
for the Volunteers' sports information department from 1994-96, said he 
didn't see any instances of abuse while handling media inquiries for the
volleyball program under Hermann. He attended virtually all of 
Tennessee's games during that stretch, but he wasn't at all practices.

'Never did I see anything that I would
deem as inappropriate or just like so outlandish that it was bordering 
on abuse,' Gesualdo said. 'I can't say I saw anything at all that 
bordered on abuse.'

Still, the Louisville lawsuit is bound
to bring greater focus on the hiring of the 49-year-old Hermann. On 
Monday, Hermann said that she has no plans to resign and Barchi later 
said the university was standing behind her.

Whether Hermann stays or goes, the 
past two months have been a huge embarrassment for Rutgers, which was 
celebrating an invitation in November to join the Big Ten Conference in 
2014.

After Rice was ousted and Pernetti was
forced to resign, the university said new basketball coach Eddie Jordan
had a degree from Rutgers when he didn't. There was additional 
controversy when men's lacrosse coach Brian Brecht was suspended for 
verbally abusing his players following a university-wide investigation 
into all Scarlet Knights coaches. Brecht missed the final two games of 
the season.

Whistleblower: The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012

Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You're a f***ing f****t!'Â
