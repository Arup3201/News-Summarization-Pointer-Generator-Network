A man has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving after a young couple were killed when their car was hit by two high-powered Audis.

Amy Hobson, 22, and Aaron Jones, 19, died after their Vauxhall Corsa was in collision with an Audi RS3 and an Audi S3 in Swinton, near Manchester, on Sunday.

Mr Jones died at the scene while Ms Hobson, who was in the front passenger seat, was taken to hospital where she later died.

Carl David Wood, 27 from Farnworth, Greater Manchester, has been charged with two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and will appear at Manchester City Magistrates' Court today.

Witnesses, including people in a golf club who rushed out to help, described the scene as a 'horrible sight'

A 25-year-old man, who was also arrested 
in connection with the young couple's deaths, remains in hospital and 
has been bailed while he receives treatment.

The smash caused one of the Audis to burst into flames.

The Corsa is believed to have been emerging from a side road at the time of the incident.

Police have said they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the collision.

Mr Jones's father Rob, 49, today paid tribute to the teenager.

Mr Jones and Ms Hobson are both thought to have lived in Salford

He said: 'He had a heart of gold. He had lots of friends. Everybody he met just took to him. He had a rather dry sense of humour like me. His mum would say we were as bad as each other.

'I just can't believe he's gone. I keep expecting him to walk through the door and say: "Aha - fooled you".'

His mother Michelle, 45, said: 'The T-shirt I took for him last night had "Mr Cool" on it. That was just him. He had such a gorgeous smile and lovely bright blue eyes.'

Mr Jones and Ms Hobson had been together for about a year after meeting while working at McDonalds in Swinton.

His father said: 'She was a nice girl and we took to her like she was part of the family.'

The couple said they wanted to get in touch with Ms Hobson's family to offer their support.

Police have charged Carl David Wood, 27, in relation to the collision. Another 25-year-old man was arrested, but has been bailed while undergoing treatment in hospital

The 155mph Audi RS3, which can take 17.5-seconds to get from 0-125mph, and the 151mph Audi S3, which can do 0-60mph 
in 6.6 seconds, were travelling towards Manchester on the main East Lancashire
 Road.

It is believed golfers at nearby Swinton 
Park Golf Club rushed to the scene after hearing the impact to help 
those involved in the accident.

One witness said: 'I heard the impact, a horrifying screech of brakes then bangs and dust flying up.

'Both Audis were damaged but one 
caught fire. People were running out of the golf club to help. We 
believe that one clipped the other before the crash.

'We
 went out and tried to stop traffic and clear the road up. It looked 
like the passenger side of the car took the brunt of the smash.'

The collision caused one of the Audis to burst into flames

The A580 was closed between Lancaster Road and Worsley Road for several hours while investigations were carried out

Motorist Lynne Scanlan told SalfordOnline.com: 'We saw a 
lady being given CPR on the road and there looked to be cars just strewn
 everywhere. It was a terrible scene.'

Mr Jones and Ms Hobson are both thought to have lived in Salford. Ms Hobson is the mother of a three-year-old son.

The A580 was closed between Lancaster Road and Worsley Road for several hours. Greater Manchester Police are appealing for witnesses.
