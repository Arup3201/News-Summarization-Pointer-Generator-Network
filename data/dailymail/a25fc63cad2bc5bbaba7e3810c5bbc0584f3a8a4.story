Mark Hateley and Glenn Hoddle followed their former manager’s career closely after he left Monaco to go to Japan and then on to England, and have been fascinated to watch him adapt to changing circumstances at Arsenal.

Over lunch in Monaco, the former team-mates discussed Wenger’s evolution over the years, and whether this is the year he can finally end his quest for a Champions League triumph.

MARK HATELEY: When he went to Japan I thought: ‘What’s he doing?’ His credentials were good, he would probably have got a really decent team in Europe.

GLENN HODDLE: Spurs fans won’t like me saying it, but I was England manager when he came to England and David Dein was on the committee. He phoned me about seven times. David was saying: ‘I’m the only one on the board who wants him. No one else has ever heard of him.’ And I said: ‘Go and get him. Wherever he goes he’ll be successful.’

If Arsene Wenger wins the Champions League I don't think Tottenham fans will ever forgive me... I told Arsenal to sign him, says Hoddle 

MH: He can be a stubborn man. That’s an understatement, wouldn’t you say? But he’s had to adapt. I think he’s been impatient because of the change over from Highbury to the Emirates.

He’s probably as frustrated as the fans and he’s not had the ability to replace people with really top players. He’s had to work in a different way.

GH: For me, he built a really good team on the back of the England back five and with Dennis Bergkamp and brought in some really good players like Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit. But when they made the move to the new stadium, he had to be spot on in his transfers and get four out of five players right whenever he bought. That never materialised and that’s what held him back.

MH: Can he win the Champions League? It depends how long he wants to go on for. I think Arsenal have improved this year and I think they are a better side going forward. It’s working out the areas and how long it will take him to fix those areas, which are goalkeeper and defence. That’s the question.

GH: The best I’ve seen them play for four or five years was at Manchester City in January.

I’ve never seen an Arsene team defend like that against a top team.

They always seem to think they can take them on. ‘We’re better than you technically.’ Even against Barcelona. I find myself saying: ‘No, you’ve got to be tight.’ One thing they have is pace to break with players like Alexis Sanchez. They used it perfectly at City. If they’re ever going to learn how to play in the Champions League and certain games away from home, that was the moment.

MH: I think they had the same experience at Borussia Dortmund last year, when they won 1-0. But I didn’t think they learnt as much from that as they did against City.

GH: If they get through someone’s going to get Porto or Basel in the quarters. Going forward they’re better than Chelsea, better than City. But for me they have to defend like they did against City.

Alexis Sanchez has added extra  pace to Arsenal and the Chilean will be key to their European hopes

Arsenal defended resolutely in the 2-0 win at Manchester City and must recreate that form in Europe

MH: We were always defensively solid at Monaco. He thought we had enough firepower in midfield and up front. But he trusted a lot in centre-halves Remy Vogel and Patrick Battiston. One was a real stopper and the other could read the game like nobody else. That is a massive joker to have in your pocket if you want to play expansive football: a really smart centre half who sees the game very quickly.

GH: He’s always had a good spine and I’m not sure he has a good spine at the moment. If you put Nemanja Matic into his team, it would be transformed. And he’s not an out-and-out defensive midfielder... just a good player. If Arsenal get a player like him and a keeper, they have the firepower.

MH: Is he convinced by his goalkeeper?

GH: No, I wouldn’t think so. But I think they’ll have more than enough to win over the two legs.
