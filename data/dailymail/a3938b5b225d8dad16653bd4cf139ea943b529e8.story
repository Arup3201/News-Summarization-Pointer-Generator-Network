Diego Maradona has risked the wrath of the Argentine public after claiming national star Lionel Messi does not deserve to win his fifth Ballon d'Or this year.

The Barcelona forward is on the shortlist of three along with last year's winner Cristiano Ronaldo, but Maradona believes Manuel Neuer should take the trophy.

The German goalkeeper won the World Cup in Brazil last summer, with Maradona claiming the other two candidates 'took a break'.

Maradona may not be too popular in his home country after opting against siding with Lionel Messi

'Neither Messi nor Ronaldo are my choice; my candidate is Neuer who did more to merit the award,' Maradona, who scored 31 goals for Argentina, told television programme De Zurda on a recent visit to Cuba.

'I think Ronaldo and Messi took a break,'

Portuguese striker Ronaldo is the favourite for the award after scoring 62 goals for club and country in 2014, also finding the net during the Champions League final win against Atletico Madrid in Lisbon.

Despite trailing his rival by only four goals last year, Messi has been accused of suffering with a dip in form at Barcelona as the Catalan giants struggled for success.

Meanwhile, Neuer has gone from strength to strength with Bayern Munich and his national team, impressing with his shot-stopping and sweeper-keeper style.
