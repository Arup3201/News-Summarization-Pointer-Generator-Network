One of the inspectors, Lee Barham, was found guilty of misconduct while writing the report 

Pressure mounted last night for an inquiry into an alleged Labour 'stitch-up' of the first privately run NHS hospital.

A Tory MP wrote to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt calling for an urgent investigation into how the Care Quality Commission came to brand Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Cambridgeshire 'inadequate'.

The demand came as it emerged that a CQC inspector was found guilty of professional misconduct while writing the damning report. 

Senior paramedic Lee Barham, 42, was part of the team that unexpectedly condemned Hinchingbrooke, despite previous findings that it was one of Britain's best-performing hospitals. 

Between the hospital's inspection in September and the report's publication this month, a conduct hearing upheld allegations that Mr Barham failed to tell managers an unqualified student paramedic had given a patient morphine. 

Mr Barham also swore abusively at his junior colleague and 'stole' his mobile phone, a Health and Care Professions Council panel ruled in October.

The disciplinary committee found his actions amounted to misconduct and fell 'seriously below the standards expected of a registered paramedic'.

The revelation raises questions about the CQC's highly critical report into Hinchingbrooke, which was published days after Circle, the private firm running the hospital, withdrew from its contract. 

A Tory MEP said it was 'shocking' that the inspection relied on someone found guilty of misconduct and the CQC had been 'seriously undermined'.

A Daily Mail investigation has provoked suspicions that the CQC report was directed by senior Labour and union figures opposed to NHS privatisation. 

One inspector is linked to pressure group Keep Our NHS Public, another is a former member of the doctors' trade union, and a paediatrician standing for Labour at the General Election is believed to have heavily influenced the findings.

Jonathan Djanogly, the Conservative MP for Huntingdon, where the hospital is based, has asked Mr Hunt to 'urgently start an inquiry to get to the bottom of what did or did not happen'.

'Like many others, I simply cannot reconcile the negative tone of the CQC report with my own experience of the hospital,' he wrote. 'Nothing that I have seen before the CQC report would justify calling the hospital 'inadequate'.'

Stressing he had not received any concrete evidence of 'corruption, fraud or political collusion', Mr Djanogly added: 'The hospital has been at the receiving end of an ongoing and vicious attack by the public sector trade unions, who have perceived Hinchingbrooke to be the 'thin end of the wedge' for what they call the 'privatisation of the NHS'.'

Mr Barham's involvement in the Hinchingbrooke report was secret until now because he is not named in the 96-page document.

When first contacted by the Mail about Mr Barham last week, the health watchdog incorrectly claimed that the misconduct allegations against him were 'dropped' and that he had a 'clean record in respect of his paramedic duties'.

But in fact the HCPC panel upheld three of four allegations made against Mr Barham, although it decided not to impose any sanction on him.

The allegations related to a student paramedic whom Mr Barham mentored while working as a manager for private firm Thames Ambulance Service.

He discovered that the junior member of staff had given a patient morphine in July 2012 despite not being allowed to administer controlled drugs, the hearing was told.

The NHS is treated like a sacred religion and it is 'taboo' to criticise it, a Tory MP warned yesterday.

Charlotte Leslie, a member of the Commons health committee, said the health service was 'not equipped' to deal with 21st century problems.

She said the 'dangerous' tendency to regard the NHS as an object of faith prevented people from discussing solutions sensibly. Miss Leslie wrote on the ConservativeHome website that the NHS was 'at the heart of our sacred taboos'.

She added: 'The most dangerous aspect of this 'religion' is that it prevents anyone from sensibly discussing solutions.'

A recent poll found that the NHS will be the most important issue for voters in the election.

But Mr Barham did not tell his bosses about the incident, instead relying on the student to inform senior managers himself. The HCPC panel said this resulted in a 'potential risk to patients' because the trainee paramedic was not formally reprimanded for his error for ten months.

Mr Barham later took his junior colleague's mobile phone without permission and sent text messages from it to the student's girlfriend. Mr Barham later admitted: 'It is the most stupid thing I have ever done. I took the phone because I knew he had been talking about me.'

Ruling that he should not receive any punishment, the HCPC panel concluded: 'The panel were satisfied that these events amounted to lapses in behaviour which were isolated and out of character, and which did not affect patients.'

But Tory East of England MEP David Campbell Bannerman said yesterday: 'It is shocking that in addition to the findings of Labour Party stooges, now we see that the CQC report on Hinchingbrooke relied on evidence from someone guilty of misconduct in their profession. A new independent inquiry must be carried out into the Hinchingbrooke report as a matter of urgency.'

A woman who answered the door of Mr Barham's house in the village of Great Horkesley, near Colchester in Essex, referred all inquiries to the CQC yesterday.

A CQC spokesman said: 'We have no concerns about Mr Barham's work as an inspector or [his ability] to carry out his role to the highest standards with professionalism and integrity.'
