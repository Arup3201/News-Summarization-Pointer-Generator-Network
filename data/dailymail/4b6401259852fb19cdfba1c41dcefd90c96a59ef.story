It was supposed to be a grand celebration of the engineering triumph that forged a nation.

But instead, the 100th anniversary of the Panama Canal's opening was today marred by the failure of plans for a multibillion-dollar expansion.

The work, which began in the Central American country in September 2007 and is the largest project at the 
canal since its construction, was due to be finished this year.

However, it has been delayed by 14 months after becoming beset by problems, including cost overruns, strikes and the threat of competition from a Chinese rival route.

Engineering triumph: The 100th anniversary of the Panama Canal's (pictured) opening was today marred by doubt as plans for a multibillion-dollar expansion are failing

Celebrations: Fireworks
 over the canal and live music are just a few of the events scheduled to
 celebrate the 100th anniversary of the waterway that forged a nation

Transformation: Currently,
 the canal can only accommodate vessels carrying up to 5,000 TEUs (a 
unit of cargo capacity), but that will change following its expansion

Grand
 plans: A multi-billion dollar canal expansion will include locks that 
are as wide as 180ft and can accept much larger container ships

The latest setback in the canal's 
expansion came in May, when about 5,000 laborers walked off the job for 
two weeks as part of a strike over wages by construction workers 
nationwide.

That
 followed a two-week stoppage in February in a dispute over $1.6billion
 in extra costs between the canal's administrator and the European 
contractor building a third new set of locks.

Meanwhile, a Chinese firm was recently awarded a contract to build a $40billion (£23billion) waterway 
through Nicaragua, around 420 miles north.

The 173-mile waterway would stretch from Punta Gorda on the Caribbean through Lake Nicaragua to the mouth of the river Brito on the Pacific; the path initially favored by 19th century American 
engineers.

While just a threat on paper for now, Panamanian authorities 
have responded with the possibility of digging a fourth set of locks to 
maintain dominance.

Because of the interruptions and 
overspending, the canal's original completion date of this October has been 
pushed back by 14 months and analysts say more delays can't be ruled 
out. 

Journey: The work, which began in the country in September 2007 and is the largest project at the canal since its construction, was due to be finished this year

Vessel: But it has been delayed by 14 months after becoming beset by problems, including cost overruns, strikes and the threat of competition from a Chinese rival route. Above a vessel travels through the Miraflores locks of the Panama Canal

The
 construction of the 48-mile ship canal across the Isthmus of Panama a 
century ago transformed international trade, greatly reducing travel 
time between the Atlantic and the Pacific by eliminating the need for 
ships to go around the tip of South America.

The construction claimed 
the lives of an estimated 30,000 workers, many from diseases like 
malaria and yellow fever.

As
 part of the £3billion expansion project, wider locks with mechanical 
gates will reduce congestion and be able accommodate post-Panamex 
vessels, which are as long as three football fields and have the 
capacity to carry about 2.5 times the number of containers than held by 
ships currently using the canal.

Canal 
administrator Jorge Quijano acknowledges he would have liked to finish 
the expansion in time for Friday's centennial. 'But we knew from the 
beginning a project as complex as this wouldn't necessarily be done on 
time', he said.

However, not
 everyone is as understanding. Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou 
complained about the delays during a recent visit to Panama, saying they
 affect his country's trade with the United States.

Rivalry: A Chinese firm was recently awarded a contract to build a $40billion (£23billion) waterway through Nicaragua, around 420 miles north of the Panama Canal

A century old: Panama is currently undertaking a massive canal expansion project, with hopes of having an additional traffic lane completed in 14 months

Grand opening: The canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and revolutionised maritime travel and trade, first opened on August 15, 1914 

Two major cargo 
shippers, Denmark's Maersk and Taiwan's Evergreen, have already rerouted
 part of their operations, depriving the canal of about $80 million a 
year, Quijano says.

When
 funding for the expansion was approved by a referendum in 2006, its 
completion was envisioned as a coming out party for Panama, a chance to 
showcase the country's pro-business credentials and role as a linchpin 
of global commerce. 

But
 competition is lurking. In addition to the proposed waterway through Nicaragua, Egypt is embarking on an expansion of the Suez 
Canal.

Reflecting
 the more subdued mood, President Juan Carlos Varela opposed suggestions
 that the centennial be declared a national holiday. 'The anniversary is
 best celebrated by working,' he told journalists recently. 'Panama 
already has plenty of free days.'

Varela
 didn't attend a low-key ceremony held at the Miraflores locks Friday 
morning. About 100 people, including canal workers, showed up to wave 
flags and greet cargo ships as they passed by, while a school band 
played patriotic songs.

Think big: Panama has even toyed with the idea of developing a fourth set of mechanical locks, which would further increase the canal's travel capacity

Early days: During construction, French workers used dredging machines to dig. The canal's expansion will allow for dredging boats to now travel the waterway

Panamanians
 will celebrate their canal's anniversary with an evening of fireworks 
and a free concert by salsa crooner Ruben Blades, before a 500-pound cake will 
be served to hundreds of VIPs. 

Descendants of French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps, the canal's flamboyant first developer, are expected to attend.

So
 are relatives of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, whose enthusiasm 
for the 'big ditch"'spurred the isthmus to proclaim its independence 
from Colombia in 1903 and sign a treaty granting perpetual control of 
the future waterway and adjacent 550-square mile canal zone to the 
United States. 

Nostalgia
 for those earlier days runs deep in Paraiso, or Paradise in English, a 
village on the canal's Pacific Ocean entrance where blue U.S. mailboxes 
recall a vibrant, bygone era when it was part of the canal zone. 

While
 Panama has prospered in the past decade, taxi driver Carlos Bennett 
said the benefits haven't been shared widely. Like many Panamanians, 
he's counting on the canal expansion to lift the nation's welfare but is
 concerned that the recent stumbles could backfire.

Malaria and yellow fever ran rampant during construction with nearly 30,000 workers losing their lives on the project

In 1942, a new set of locks were added near Panama City, where the bulk of the 100th anniversary celebrations will take place

'The
 anniversary should've been the moment to celebrate the expansion 
project, that all of Panama needs urgently,' said Mr Bennett, the 
grandson of a canal worker who emigrated from the British Virgin 
Islands.

'We can't afford the luxury of looking like we're incapable to the rest of the world.'

Linking 
the Isthmus of Panama, the canal eliminated the need for ships to go around the
 dangerous waters along South America's tip, reducing fuel costs and 
travel times. 

Despite
 the subdued anniversary, each Saturday in August, 'Magical Nights at 
the Panama Canal,' will open to the public from 6 to 10pm and will 
include fireworks, live music, and dancing, as well as historical 
costumed characters.
