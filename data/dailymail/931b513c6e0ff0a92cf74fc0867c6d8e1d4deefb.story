A record number of trade workers including builders, plumbers and plasterers are now women, new research reveals.

The rise in female workers – dubbed ‘white-van women’ - to almost 6 per cent of the industry is said to have resulted from a rise in women turning to DIY to improve their homes.

The surge is also put down to employers seeking tradespeople who are reliable and good with customer service – which many believe women are better at.

These figures have been accompanied by a drop in the number of foreign migrants working as builders and tradesmen, which has virtually halved in the past four years, according to a study of 10,000 in the industry.

Women now represent 5.7 per cent of trade workers, according to the research by IronmongeryDirect, while the numbers of migrant workers fell to 4.6 per cent from 8 per cent.

‘Despite the UK moving out of the recession and the economy showing signs of growth, the UK appears less of an attractive prospect to migrant workers looking to find work, with numbers falling dramatically,’ said Wayne Lysaght-Mason, of Ironmongery Direct.

‘It’s also interesting to see that women now represent a significant, if still small, proportion of the sector. The emergence of white-van women could be a major trend as the economy continues to grow.’

He added: ‘We’re seeing more employers actively seeking to employ females.

The rise in female workers to almost 6 per cent of the industry is said to have resulted from a rise in women turning to DIY to improve their homes and inspired by TV programmes with presenters like Melinda Messenger

‘Attitudes in this workplace are changing, and there is a rise in women enrolling on trade courses and getting jobs in the industry.

‘It’s an attractive career route for many, and for which women are just as suited as men.’

This growth is reflected in the launch of Women in Trade magazine at the end of last year - the first tradeswomen-focused magazine in the UK.

Janet Kirlew, its editor in chief, said: ‘The most common comments from these women who started their own business in a trade were that they believed that they can make a huge difference, even though the UK labour market is still very segregated.’

She added: ‘One of the most common reasons why they set up their business was due to their own frustration and difficulty in finding competent and reliable tradespeople with good customer service. They recognised a gap in the market.’ 

In 2012 DIY store B&Q revealed they experienced a five-fold increase in the female take-up of their workshops across the country.

More than 3,200 enrolled in classes to learn skills such as plastering, wall tiling, changing taps and hanging wallpaper in July 2012 compared to 592 at the previous year.

This dramatic increase was said to be the beginning of a growing trend that shows no signs of slowing down.

Some women have been made redundant from careers as diverse as banking to events managing or have previously been stay at home mothers who have gone on to set up their own companies.

Jeremy Brett, the director of the Consumer Protection Association, said he has also noticed a change in the industry.

‘We have been operating in the building and home-improvement industry for over 20 years and there has been a quantum shift,’ he said.

‘Wind back 20 years and it was very rare to see woman working in the building trade, but we are seeing a change.’ 

He added: ‘It’s also changing at a management level - we’re seeing more woman taking roles as CEOs and directors. The perception is still that it is a male profession, but I don’t know how long that will be the reality for.’ 

A spokesman for the Guild of Master Craftsmen also commented: ‘We have many female members in a variety of trades including bricklaying, decorating, plumbing, landscape gardening and interior design.’ 

UK Trades Training, based in South Shields, for instance had just one woman turning up for a tiling course in 2004.

It now gets around 30 a year enrolling in training for trades including tiling, plastering, bathroom installation and kitchen fitting.
