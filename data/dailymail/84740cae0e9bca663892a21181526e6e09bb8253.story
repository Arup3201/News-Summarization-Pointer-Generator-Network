Parents have threatened to take their children out of a top independent school after an intruder walked into a girls’ changing room and indecently assaulted a young pupil.

The girl was threatened with violence when the man approached her at Felsted Preparatory School, near Great Dunmow, Essex.

She managed to escape and alert a teacher but her attacker fled from the grounds of the school, which was founded in the 16th century and has fees of up to £19,080 for boarders, rising to £26,385 in the senior school.

Police have issued an efit of the pervert and have appealed for information. They refused to rule out the possibility he might strike again or at another school.

Furious parents yesterday questioned how a stranger was able to make his way on to school property unchallenged.

One father, who did not want to be named, said: ‘A man walked in off the street and into the girls’ changing rooms and assaulted one of the girls.

'She ran off screaming. I am very angry about this and am taking my daughter out of the sixth form.’

Another said: ‘This has shaken my trust in the school. If they cannot protect my daughter then I have to consider other options.’

A mother added: ‘A lot of the parents are worried that this chap will come back.

‘The grounds here at Felsted are incredibly open, so in that respect it is very easy for anyone to make their way on to the premises.

‘In all honesty, I don’t think you will be able to stop people as the school is the size of a village and there are always so many people coming and going. But I am still shocked.’

The sex attack took place just before 11am on Tuesday.

Sources said it involved one of the older pupils in the preparatory school, which takes children aged four to 13.

The school’s site security policy document states ‘many of the existing buildings were not designed with security in mind’ and its ‘open door policy in some areas can put staff and pupils at risk’.

Prep school headmistress Jenny Burrett said: ‘Our focus has understandably been on the welfare of the individual involved and providing support to her and her family.’

She added: ‘We have obviously increased vigilance.’

Essex Police said the intruder was 5ft 10in, white, about 30, with crooked teeth and gelled, dark brown hair.

A spokesman for the force said: ‘We can’t predict this person’s future intentions.’
