Loss: Corrine Gump, 10, and her grandparents were killed in an early morning fire on Monday

A 10-year-old alleged rape victim and her grandparents have died in a massive fire at their home just hours before her suspected attacker was set to go on trial.

Corrine Gump and her maternal grandparents, Judith Schmidt, 61, and William Schmidt, 63, who were both deaf, lost their lives in the early-morning blaze in Youngstown, Ohio on Monday.

Neighbors reported hearing loud explosions at 3.30am before the fire tore through the house.

Later that day, Robert Seman, Jr., 46, was set to stand trial on four counts of rape and four counts of gross sexual imposition.

Seman, himself a father to a two-year-old child, had been accused of abusing Corrine from when she was just four years old until she was eight, WFMJ reported, citing an indictment from a year ago.

Since April last year, he had been under electronically-monitored house arrest but on Monday his bond was revoked because he allegedly tried to bribe a witness in the rape case, WFMJ reported.

Authorities said he had not been taken back into custody because of the fire.

Investigators said they have found no evidence that the origin of the blaze was suspicious.

But because Corinne was an alleged victim, the Youngstown Police are involved in the investigation, Sergeant Ron Barber told WKYC.

Accused: It came just hours before Robert Seman, Jr., 46, (pictured) was set to go on trial for charges that he had sexually assaulted her. He was under house arrest and electronic monitoring at the time of the fire

Authorities looking to interview the girl's mother on Monday said that they found her at a house listed in court records as Seman’s house arrest address, WKBN reported.

When they had checked for her there earlier that morning, she had not be in, they said. 

Neighbors told 21 News that they heard two explosions and one neighbor said she awoke to what she thought was a flickering light outside.

'It was fully involved,' Fire Chief John O'Neill told The Youngstown Vindicator. 'We had quite a bit of fire in the basement, so that's the likely origin. They had fire all through the house, top to bottom. The floors were giving way almost immediately upon entry.' 

The three bodies were found on the second floor.

It is not yet clear if they had smoke detectors in the home. Smoke detectors for the hearing-impaired can send vibrations, sound or light to alert residents.

Steve Leland, director of Easter Seals Youngstown Hearing and Speech Center Community Center, told the Vindicator that the local deaf community is mourning the loss of the couple. 

Battle: Firefighters pulled the three bodies from the second floor of the home on Monday morning

Destruction: Fire officers said the blaze quickly ripped through the home from bottom to top. But they said there was no evidence that the cause of the fire was suspicious

Questions: Fire Captain Kurt Wright and a State Fire Marshall look into the back of the house on Monday as an investigation continues into the cause of the fire. Neighbors reported hearing explosions

'Bill and Judy were always willing to talk to parents who'd just found out they had a deaf child,' he said. 'They would often discuss options for raising a deaf child, talking about their own personal life experiences, being deaf themselves, and raising deaf children.'

The couple had three children, two of whom are deaf. William Schmidt was a retired AT&T lineman, while his wife taught deaf people sign language, the publication reported.

'They were very outgoing, very sweet people, always ready to help,' Leland added.

Corrine was a 4th grade student at South Range School, where officials have assembled a crisis team to counsel students and staff affected by the tragedy.

Seman's trial has been delayed in light of the deaths but no new date has yet been set. He could face life in prison if convicted of the charges.
