The Queen has been dragged into a row by MPs over whether to allow Parliament's chapel to host gay weddings.

MPs are demanding that the chapel, the main place of Christian worship in the Palace of Westminster, can be used for the same sex ceremonies - a controversial move which has the support of commons speaker John Bercow.

But it has today been claimed that Sir Christopher Geidt, the Queen's private secretary,  is also being consulted over the possibility of allowing same-sex marriages in St Mary Undercroft.

The Church of England is to be exempt from any new gay marriage legislation - and as such, same sex weddings will not be allowed on its properties.

If the ceremonies were allowed to take place in the chapel, where the body of Baroness Thatcher was held ahead of her funeral, it would have to cut all association with the Church, the Sunday Telegraph reports.

St Mary Undercroft is a popular marriage venue for MPs. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, married his wife Ffion there

But because the chapel is a 'Royal Peculiar' and therefore under the authority of the Queen, she and Buckingham Palace now appear to be involved in the issue.

The paper claims to have seen emails to and from Black Rod,  Lt Gen David Leakey, the most senior official in the Lords.

Labour MP Chris Bryant has proposed the area be changed into a multi-faith area,

It would mean many different religious denominations would be able to marry the gay couples in Parliament.

Mr Bryant, former Anglican vicar, asked Helen Grant, equalities minister if she could write to the Queen to ask if St Mary Undercroft could be used as 'a space for multi-faith purposes' in order for it to be used as a same sex wedding venue.

At the time, Mrs Grant said she would consider how the Government could assist.

Mr Bryant has also written to the commons speaker to Mr Bercow asking him to help lift restrictions on the chapel.

He is said to be 'seeking advice' but is reportedly 'very sympathetic'.

It would put Mr Bercow in direct opposition to the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, who is being kept informed of the row by parliamentary officials.

Mr Bryant is also said to have communicated with other figures in Parliament, Buckingham Palace and the Church

Lt Gen Leakey is said to be against Mr Bryant's proposals.

In correspondence released to the paper under the Freedom of Information act, Tory MP and chairman of the Christians in Parliament group Gary Streeter,  warned there would be 'substantial opposition' to turning the chapel into a multi-faith space.

It is believed that the only way to change the chapel would be to introduce legislation either originating in the General Synod or in the Commons, with the Church's permission.

The coffin of British former prime minister Margaret Thatcher rests in the Crypt Chapel of St Mary Undercroft. Because the chapel is a 'Royal Peculiar' and therefore under the authority of the Queen, she and Buckingham Palace now appear to be involved in the issue

Two rooms in the Palace of Westminster have already been approved as venues for civil weddings

St Mary Undercroft is a popular marriage venue for MPs. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, and Charles Kennedy, the former Liberal Democrat leader, are among those who have wed there.

A spokesman for the Queen said Buckingham Palace officials were being kept updated on the discussions but that is was a 'matter for Parliament and the Government'.
