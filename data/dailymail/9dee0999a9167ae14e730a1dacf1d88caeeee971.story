Just 13 games in to the Sky Bet Championship season and we have already had five different league leaders.

The latest of those, Derby County, ascended to the top of the table with a 1-0 win at Blackpool on Tuesday night. It was their fifth victory in seven games.

Perhaps more poignantly, Derby are unbeaten in 10 games. Yes, four of those results have been draws, some not pretty, but they only serve to demonstrate the resiliance which makes the Rams arguably the most likely of the five table-toppers so far this season to be there come May 2.

Steve McClaren consoles defender Richard Keogh after Wembley's play-off final defeat by QPR

The quartet of Watford, Norwich, Nottingham Forest and to a lesser extent Bournemouth have the attacking flair to challenge Derby for automatic promotion, but may all lack the consistency to keep in touch with Steve McClaren's relentless Rams.

Since the former England manager took the helm at the iPro Stadium just over a year ago, Derby have maintained a handy knack of churning out points, only losing consecutive matches twice and never going more than four games without a win.

In fact, were McClaren in charge for more than 36 games last season, then surely Derby would have joined Midlands rivals Leicester in the automatic promotion places, rather than being consigned to that agonising defeat by QPR at Wembley (which the quality of their football simply did not deserve).

It seems almost incredible to think of the furious fallout from Nigel Clough's sacking in late September last year given McClaren's popularity in Derby.

Clough's foundation work has to be appreciated; much of McClaren's side was inherited from the now-Sheffield United boss, but the 'Wally with the Brolly' has truly rebuilt his reputation on these shores.

European football aficionados will point out that he did that when winning the Dutch league with the unfashionable Twente in 2010, but it was very much out of sight, out of mind with regards to McClaren for the English football fan.

Given his success in Holland, adopting the same fluid 4-3-3 system he uses at Derby, McClaren was expected to bring verve and flair to the iPro, which he has, but it has been his ability to get the best out of seasoned Football League pros that has impressed and surprised most in the last year.

While neither started on Tuesday night, defender Jake Buxton and midfielder John Eustace have been key men for Derby in the last year, McClaren getting them to fit in to a modern, European system despite their reputations as uncompromising journeymen.

Derby's two key men over the last year, striker Chris Martin and midfielder Craig Bryson, were both underperforming under Clough, but now look like two of the best players outside the Premier League, and more then capable of making the step up.

Chris Martin has been a revelation since McClaren took over and has scored 10 goals already this season

McClaren has continued to put faith in youth as Clough did before him, with academy-product midfielders Jeff Hendrick and Will Hughes flourishing in the first-team and Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe excelling on loan, just as fellow Red Andre Wisdom did the season before.

All in all, it has been a brilliant year or so for Derby under McClaren, with 34 wins coming from 56 games; the Rams losing just 10 games. The only blot on the copybook being that last minute Bobby Zamora strike at Wembley.

The last two champions in the second tier, Leicester and Cardiff, got their noses out in front early and never looked back. It's taken Derby 13 games to get to the top - and McClaren 13 months - but they may just be there for good.

Good week for… SHREWSBURY. The last four days could not have gone any better for Micky Mellon’s side. Two wins, six points, six goals scored, zero conceded. Pre-season promotion favourites in League Two, Shrewsbury started strongly but a run of just one win in six games had seen them slip some way off the automatic places. Tuesday night’s 5-0 thrashing of pace-setters Bury bodes well though; it’s now three wins on the spin for Mellon’s men, who are back up to fifth and just four points off Wycombe at the top of the table.

Bad week for… COVENTRY. Coventry’s performances have plummeted this season along with their attendances. On their return to the Ricoh Arena in September the Sky Blues drew in a crowd of 27,306, beat Gillingham 1-0 and moved up to eighth place in League One. On Saturday, just 11,888 were in attendance as Steven Pressley’s side lost to unbeaten league leaders Bristol City, a result which was compounded by Tuesday night’s 4-1 thrashing at Oldham. Pressley's side are now just one point off the bottom of the table in 20th place.

Talent scout: Michael Petrasso (Notts County)

QPR have all but abandoned their academy in recent years as Tony Fernandes has ploughed tens of millions of pounds into signing players, but young Canadian winger Petrasso may be hard to ignore if his career continues on its upward trajectory. The 19-year-old, just 5ft 6in, scored twice as Notts County moved up to fifth place in League One with an impressive 3-2 win at Barnsley on Tuesday night. Petrasso, playing just his second game for Shaun Derry’s side, also looked good on loan at Coventry last season.
