Many of us haven't upgraded from DVD to hi-def Blu-Rays yet - but technology companies are already preparing for the next stage, with televisions, players and discs that will offer 'Ultra HD' resolutions.

Sony and LG are gearing up for new Blu-Ray discs that offer 'Ultra HD' definitions far higher than normal Full HD, such as 4K - four times higher than normal HD, and near the resolutions offered in Imax theatres.

'We're expecting the arrival of 4K 
Blu-rays in 2013,' said John Taylor, LG's Vice President of Communications told website Pocket-Lint.

Sony's new S790 player, due out this year, will 'upscale' Blu-Rays to 4K resolution. Sony is also rumoured to be in talks with film studios about a new specification of Blu-Ray discs capable of storing and showing films in the new 'Ultra HD' format

The discs could be on the market as early
as 2013. LG, Toshiba and others have televisions capable of 
Ultra HD.

Sony's new S790 player, due out this year, will 'upscale' Blu-Rays to 4K resolution.

'The player will upscale Full HD Blu-rays to 4k definition. For this to happen you would need a 4K capable screen,' says a company spokesperson.

Sony is rumoured to be in talks with film studos to finalise a specification for 4K Blu-Rays.

Many films are already shot using 4K cameras.David Fincher's The Social Network was shot and screened in 4K, and an increasing number of cinema films use the format.

LG's new 'ultra HD' set offers a screen resolution of 3840x2160, around 16 times that of existing Full HD TVs

LG's
set will be one of many televisions to offer resolutions above Full HD.
There are several resolutions of 'Ultra HD', from the relatively modest
2K up to 8K.

There are few devices that can play the format, thus far - although if your PC is up to it, YouTube will host 4K footage.

LG's 3D set offers a 4K resolution - but there will may be even sharper TVs in future. The BBC has already shot test footage in 8K. It's yet to be decided which could be used for broadcast

Toshiba already makes a 
'4K' television, due on sale in the UK and America shortly.
