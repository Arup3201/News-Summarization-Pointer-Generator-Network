A young Scottish entrepreuner has developed a modular home that can be assembled in just three weeks for as little as £59,000.

The Wee Housing Company was set up by 22 year-old Jennifer Hope, a University of Strathclyde graduate, with help from her father Ian, who has been working in the construction industry for over 25 years.

The homes are constructed as modular timber units at their manufacturing base in Ayrshire and then transported to the customer’s plot of land for completion. The houses can be one bedroom or two.

The company claims 'Wee House' is ideal as a second building on a property for an elderly relative, holiday home or for downsizing, and can be transported to any corner of the UK.

Parents with grown-up children underfoot will be glad to know they can also act as an affordable first home.

The original inspiration for a Wee House came from staff accommodation cottages on rural estates.

Ms Hope, who lives in a Wee House herself, said: 'The Wee House Company can handle the entire process from applying for planning permission, to the construction of the house, to installation of services, providing the customer with a self build experience for those who do not have the time to actually self build.

Living room: Unlike prefabs of yesteryear, the home is designed to last

'The construction time of a Wee House takes only eight weeks, with just three weeks work spent on the customer’s plot of land. With the majority of the construction time spent at their manufacturing base, the whole process is made easy and stress-free for the customer.'

The business recently completed their first two bedroom Wee House in Argyll and Bute in Scotland, and is currently building a one bedroom ‘grandpa annex’ in Beith, North Ayrshire and a larger two bedroom ‘Wee House’ on the Isle of Lismore.

The Lismore house will feature stained glass windows designed by an artist who lives on the Isle.

A typical one bedroom and two bedroom design is around 40m sq and 68m sq respectively. They are currently working on a 30m sq design to fit with the Scottish government’s new planning policy on ‘hutting.’

Recent legislation will make it easier for people to build ‘huts’ in the Scottish countryside for holidaying and leisure activities.

Pre-fab houses were first introduced to the UK in the wake of the Second World War for returning soldiers who had their houses demolished by German bombing during the Blitz.

Constructed in large numbers in factories, they were then moved to pre-plumbed concrete slabs where they could be put up in less than a day.

For more than 150,000 homeless, bombed-out families in Britain, these two-bedroom prefabs were designed as a temporary solution - though some still exist as permanent residences today.

While the original homes were little more than wooden huts, today's designs are far more complex, featuring large amounts of glass, steel and even brickwork.
