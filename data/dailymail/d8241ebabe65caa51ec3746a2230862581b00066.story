The UK’s first left-hand driving school has launched after it’s revealed more than a quarter of holidaymakers are afraid to drive abroad.

The course, to be held in Brixton, London, includes familiarisation with foreign road signs and roundabouts to build Brits’ confidence of taking a road trip while away.

Skyscanner is teaming up with driving instructors to offer free classes to travellers looking for practice and advice before getting behind the wheel overseas.

Nervous drivers: A quarter of Brits say they are not confident to get behind the wheel while on holiday

1. Not recognising road signs2. Getting lost3. Going around roundabouts4. Trying to navigate 5. Driving on the other side of road

The move comes after research revealed 27 per cent of Brits admitted to being afraid of driving on the opposite side of the road. 

The survey of 1,084 adults also showed 36 per cent admit they don't research driving laws before driving abroad and 24 per cent would prefer their partners to drive.

Skyscanner's Mary Porter said: ‘With two-thirds of the world's countries driving on the right-hand side of the road we wanted to give British holidaymakers the confidence they need to drive overseas. 

‘Rules and regulations vary from country to country so we've also published a guide to provide some clarity for drivers including top tips on driving on the opposite side of the road. 

‘There is so much to discover off the beaten track so we hope people make the most of it without the fear of driving abroad.’

Unfamiliar signs: Not understanding road signs is a top fear for Brits driving abroad

The guide includes a list of national speed limits for UK's most popular holiday destinations and also a list of unusual road signs they may come across as this is cited as the most fearful part of driving overseas.

There are also top tips on how to drive on the right as well as a list of some of the more unusual driving laws from across the globe.

Classes will run on Saturday, July 12 in Brixton, London and are subject to availability.

Those looking to take part in the left-hand driving school can apply for a class via the Skyscanner website, www.skyscanner.net.
