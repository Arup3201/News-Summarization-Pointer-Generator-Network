Jailed: Patrick Besiris, 21, who was caught on CCTV hurling rocks at police officers during disorder in Bristol on the day of the Royal wedding

A university graduate has been jailed for 14 months for throwing rocks at police  during an anti-Tesco riot.

Patrick Besiris, 21, was part of a 200-strong crowd of protesters who attacked officers patrolling a rally against the supermarket chain.

The former politics student was filmed on CCTV hurling large stones near a controversial new store.

Despite the charges against him,  Besiris was allowed to complete his studies and achieved a first class honours degree.

But the now highly-qualified defendant has been sent to prison for his role in the Bristol riot.

Judge Michael Roach told him: ‘Your behaviour on the night in question was disgraceful. It is obvious that sort of behaviour must attract a custodial sentence.’

Besiris was filmed rioting wearing a mask and throwing missiles in the early hours of April 29 last year, the day of the Royal Wedding.

The anti-Tesco protest had drawn a 200-strong crowd to a squat known as Telepathic Heights, opposite the store, and Besiris had written on Twitter that he was ‘looking forward’ to the gathering.

He was sentenced at Bristol Crown Court after he pleaded guilty to one charge of violent disorder.

His lawyer, Srikantharajah Nereshraaj, said Besiris wished to apologise to the police and community.

He said: ‘It was inexcusable and unjustifiable. He saw the CCTV and was ashamed and appalled.’

Mr Nereshraaj said his client had overcome the behavioural condition ADHD and an inherited bi-polar disorder to obtain good qualifications.

Disorder: The student admitted pelting police officers with rocks and was yesterday jailed for 14 months at Bristol Crown Court

He had been voted chairman of his 
campus, played rugby for his university, UWE Bristol, and his local club
and had been involved with a social group which raised money for good 
causes, including bereaved students.

Afterwards John Rushforth, UWE Bristol
deputy vice-chancellor, added: ‘The university, whilst upholding 
students’ rights to peaceful protest, does not in any way condone 
violence. There is a university disciplinary process, which can result 
in a range of outcomes including withholding of degree.’

Detective Chief Inspector Will White, 
who investigated the protest and subsequent riots in Bristol last 
August, said that anyone with plans to bring disorder to the city could 
expect a ‘robust’ response.

He said: ‘We will not tolerate 
disorder of any kind that jeopardises public safety and the safety of 
police officers carrying out their work.

‘Anyone that engages in this type of behaviour should expect to be placed before the courts and dealt with in a robust manner.’

He added: ‘The sentences handed out by
the courts and the swift justice that has been administered should 
demonstrate our commitment to keeping Bristol a safe place to live and 
work.’

Carnage: Hundreds of protesters took to the streets on April 29 last year in Bristol

Destruction: Broken windows and graffiti at the Tesco store the morning after the riot

Aftermath: The riot was brought under control at around 4am. Three people were arrested on suspicion of public order offences and another person on suspicion of threats to cause criminal damage with intent to endanger life
