Doctors, nurses and other health care workers could be ordered to return the their traditional uniform of a white coat under new guidelines designed to stop the spread of infection.

Researchers say short sleeves, bare hand and regular laundering are key to stopping bugs spreading between patients.

They say ties, watches and rings should be banned.

The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America claims say short sleeves, bare hand and regular laundering are key to stopping bugs spreading between patients. They say ties, watches and rings should be banned.

The modern white coat was introduced to medicine in the late 1800s as a symbol of cleanliness.

To emphasize the transition to the more scientific approach to modern medicine, physicians sought to represent themselves as scientist.

'From Hippocrates’s admonition that physicians’ dress is essential to their dignity, to the advent of nurses’ uniforms under the leadership of Florence Nightingale, to the white coat ceremonies that continue to this day in medical schools, HCP apparel and appearance is associated with significant symbolism and professionalism,' said the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

The new guidance on hospital attire released by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, or SHEA, recommends major changes.

'Although the optimal choice of Healthcare personnel (HCP) attire for inpatient care remains undefined, we provide recommendations on the use of white coats, neckties, footwear, the bare-below-the-elbows strategy, and laundering,' the report says.

'Recent years have seen a rising awareness of the potential role of fomites in the hospital environment in the transmission of healthcare-associated microorganisms.

'Although studies have demonstrated contamination of HCP apparel with potential pathogens, the role of clothing in transmission of these microorganisms to patients has not been established.

'The paucity of evidence has stymied efforts to produce generalizable, evidence-based recommendations, resulting in widely disparate practices and requirements that vary by country, region, culture, facility, and discipline.'

The report also claims patients are more likely to trust a doctor in a white coat.

'Overall, patients express preferences for certain types of attire, with most surveys indicating a preference for formal attire, including a preference for a white coat,' the report said.

'Healthcare personnel (HCP) attire is an aspect of the medical profession steeped in culture and tradition.

'From Hippocrates’s admonition that physicians’ dress is essential to their dignity, to the advent of nurses’ uniforms under the leadership of Florence Nightingale, to the white coat ceremonies that continue to this day in medical schools, HCP apparel and appearance is associated with significant symbolism and professionalism.'

If comes after a 2011 study found more than 60 percent of health workers’ uniforms sampled by researchers tested positive for pathogens, including the germs that can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections and drug-resistant infections such as MRSA.

Researchers say short sleeves, bare hand and regular laundering are key to stopping bugs spreading between patients.

They say ties, watches and rings should be banned.

But, he said, it makes sense that there would be a connection.

'There's a theoretical basis that if you have clean clothes, you have less chance of transmitting apathogen,' he told NBC News.

SHEA members looked at studies that have found a range of worrisome bugs, from Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas to Clostridium difficile, detected on the sleeves, pockets and other sites of health care workers' coats and scrubs.

One study found that a third of doctors’ neckties grew Staph aureus in the lab; several found that the germs were often resistant to the top drugs used to treat them.
