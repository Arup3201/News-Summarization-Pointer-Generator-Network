A lack of exercise is as dangerous as smoking and is directly to blame for one in six deaths in Britain, a report has warned.

The UK is now even worse than America for inactivity – with half of women and a third of men moving so little in their daily lives that they are exposing themselves to diseases ever earlier in life.

Officials from Public Health England warned that our sedentary lifestyles are not only causing obesity – they are directly responsible for a vast range of illnesses.

A lack of exercise is as dangerous as smoking and is directly to blame for one in six deaths in Britain

These include muscle and joint complaints, depression, high blood pressure, heart disease, dementia, stroke and type 2 diabetes.

Together these cost the economy £17.6billion a year, and threaten to ‘destabilise’ the entire welfare state if current trends continue.

The report goes on to state that one in six deaths every year are directly due to inactivity. This is about 84,500 in England and Wales – a very similar number to the number of deaths attributed to smoking.

It also states that 63 per cent of adults do not take the recommended amount of exercise of two and a half hours over the course of a week.

This compares to 18 per cent in the Netherlands, 28 per cent in Germany, 33 per cent in France and 41 per cent in the US. Figures show our average levels of exercise are a fifth lower than in the 1960s and the worst in the Western world – including the US.

Experts blame our demanding office jobs, less time being spent on the housework and DIY and a preference for watching television instead of being outdoors. 

Professor Kevin Fenton, executive director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, the agency responsible for tackling obesity, said: ‘Physical inactivity is unrecognised as a significant health, social and economic burden on individuals and communities in England.

‘It is a leading contributor to rising levels of many long-term conditions such as obesity, diabetes and dementia. Our modern lifestyles amplify the problem, with even those who are already taking regular physical activity at risk of damaging their health by spending long periods sitting down.’

He added: ‘We need to make physical activity the easy, accessible and natural choice for everyone. If physical activity was a drug we’d be hailing it as a miracle cure.

‘Our living environment and working environment has changed over the past four decades and it’s all dragging us to be inactive.’

The report showed that women tend to exercise less than men, with a quarter of women and a fifth of men classed as inactive.

Officials urged people to make simple changes to their routines such as cycling to the shops, gardening at the weekend or taking the stairs rather than the lift. And this week, the head of the NHS Simon Stevens urged companies to offer staff prizes and vouchers to lose weight and be active.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘A lack of physical activity far transcends any harm done by smoking.’

And Mike Hobday, director of policy at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Physical inactivity is a serious public health concern. Young and old alike need to move more.

‘We must change this couch potato culture and put physical activity at the heart of our daily routine.’

Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said: ‘Whatever age you are, activity is vital for maintaining good health. Increasing physical activity is a priority right across Government.’
