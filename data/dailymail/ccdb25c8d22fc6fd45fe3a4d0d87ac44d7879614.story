A man in a wheelchair attacked a three-year-old boy with a hammer in a random attack in a grocery story.

Clayton Senn, 36, did not attend his hearing at an Albuquerque court on Tuesday, where he was charged in his absence of aggravated battery with great bodily harm and two counts of aggravated assault.

The boy, who has not been named, needed head surgery, after being attacked in Smith's grocery store on Monday, at about 1pm.

It is not the first time Senn, who lost both his feet to frostbite last year, has been charged with random violent crimes.

In 2008, he was jailed for two years after stabbing an Albuquerque business owner in the groin, KRQE said.

The businessman had confronted Senn after neighbors told him a man was smashing his restaurant windows.

And, in a case that has yet to go to court, Senn allegedly tried to punch a nurse at an Albuquerque hospital last year.

The stepfather of the boy injured in the most recent attack said he had to be held back by bystanders after Senn launched his attack, the Huffington Post said.

The boy's skull was fractured in the attack, but he is expected to make a full recovery.

Witnesses said Senn swung his hammer at other children but missed.

The mother of the child had turned her back for only a moment in the cereal aisle when she heard a crack, as the hammer hit her son's head, detective Brian Crafton said.

He toldÂ Koat7: '[Senn] wouldn't even make eye contact with me.'

The 36-year-old, who is refusing to 
talk to investigators, made headlines last year after being trapped in 
mud in Rio Grande for three days, before students found him.

At the time, he was known to police, 
who believe he may have been trying to hide out when he became trapped 
on the mud banks in January.

'It is possible that he was trying to stay under the radar and stay off the main streets and avoid being arrested by police, but all he would tell officers is that he was trying to get away from the city and hike and he found himself stuck,' Albuquerque police spokesman Tasia Martinez told Koat7 at the time.

He suffered frostbite during the ordeal and had to have his feet amputated.

At his hearing on Tuesday, Senn's defense attorney declined to ask for a mental evaluation for his client.
