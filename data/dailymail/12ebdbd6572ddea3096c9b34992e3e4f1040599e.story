If you think exam pressure is bad in the West, take a moment to sympathise with the students of South Korea.

Today, around 650,000 students are sitting the annual university entrance exam, which are critical to youngsters in the country, impacting not only their future careers, but also marriage.

Success in the exam means a secured place in one of South Korea's elite universities and so crucial are good results that the entire nation goes into 'hush' mode on exam day - by grounding planes, clearing roads and even halting military exercises.  

Stress: Around 650,000 students are sitting the exam simultaneously in 1,257 centres across the country

On test day, the transportation ministry bans all airport landings and departures for a 40-minute period to coincide with the main language listening test - held simultaneously in 1,257 centres nationwide.

Public offices and major businesses, as well as the stock market, opened an hour later than usual to help keep the roads relatively clear and ensure students arrived on time for the exam.   

The military has rescheduled airforce drills and live-firing exercises, while traffic is barred within a 200 metre radius of test centres.

And if you did happen to have a crisis in the morning, students could dial the emergency number 112 and request help from police cars and motorbikes on standby to rush them to exam centres.

At Seoul's Pungmoon Girls' High School, junior students huddled together holding banners wishing good luck and shouted encouragement as the seniors entered the exam room.

For the equally stressed parents, there was little left to do after a final hug at the school gates than pray.

Many immediately made their way to nearby churches and temples in search of some divine intervention.

One student with no parental backing was 81-year-old Cho Hee-Ok who sat the test in the hope of gaining a place in a fashion college.

Forced to give up her early schooling and take up needlework to help her widowed mother, Cho told Yonhap her dream was to work 'making clothes for poor neighbours'.

Major Internet portals and social networks were flooded with messages of support, and 'test-takers' and 'jackpot for the test' were among the top-trending topics for Korean Twitter users this morning.

Some warned against taking the exam too seriously.

'Don't do anything stupid,' wrote one user on the top portal Naver. 

'Don't kill yourself just because you mess up the test. There are many people who succeed in life without going to college.' 

The approach of exam day tends to renew a perennial debate in South Korea about the country's obsession with education and the pros and cons of the college entrance system.

The bottom line for many is that the examination itself is fair. Everyone takes the same paper, which relies on the multiple choice system to prevent subjective marking.

But bitter disputes still occur.

A question in the Geography section of the 2013 exam -- worth three points out of a total 340 -- became the subject of a costly, year-long legal battle after the officially correct answer was challenged by some students and their parents.

Security is absolute, with the hundreds of exam setters sequestered for more than a month in a secret location, which they are only allowed to leave once the test has been taken.

Pressure: Students sit the College Scolastic Aptitude Test at Poongmun high school in Seoul today

Unhappy: A recent study said South Korean children were the least happy among developed countries 

They are kept in total isolation, denied phone contact with their families and with everything down to their food waste subject to rigorous examination.

South Korean parents spent 19 trillion won ($17.5 billion) on extra tuition for their children last year, AFP reported. 

The pressure is so severe, that on the night before the exam, a 17-year old boy was found dead  having apparently jumped from the window of his family's apartment.

His parents told Yonhap news agency that he had become extremely stressed as the test neared. 

Preparation for the exam starts from primary school - as does the relentless pressure that has been blamed for everything from early burnout to teenage depression and suicide. 

Last week, a government study revealed South Korean children are the least
happy among developed countries, citing the stress of the nations' educational pressure cooker.

South Korea ranked at the bottom among 30 countries in terms
of children's satisfaction with their lives, the country's
health ministry said, followed by Romania and Poland.
