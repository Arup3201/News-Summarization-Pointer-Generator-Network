The positive impact a parent can have on a child’s education is more important than where they live, a new study suggests.

Growing up in an impoverished area is often blamed for holding back children academically.

But a report’s findings indicate it is the attitude towards education within their family unit that really matters.

The research involved two groups of disadvantaged children in cities across England, all of whom were waiting to move into social housing in some of the most deprived neighbourhoods.

One group moved in between one and three years before their Key Stage 3 tests at 14. The other started living there afterwards.

When their performance in the tests was measured, both groups had almost identical average scores.

Dr Felix Weinhardt, who conducted the research, said: ‘We have always tried to help the most disadvantaged children to get better life chances and one of the ways we thought we could do this is through housing policy.

‘But research now increasingly tells us that bad neighbourhood environments have no causal influence on these children’s school performances at all.’

The postdoctoral fellow in the London School of Economics’ Centre for Economic Performance added: ‘These two groups of students really get very bad grades - very similar to students who live in high-density social housing neighbourhoods and never moved.

‘This means that we definitely should think about ways to help them improve their school achievements but we cannot do it through housing policy.’

The paper - Neighbourhood Quality and Student Performance - considered whether living in a ‘bad neighbourhood’ could lead to a ‘locking-in of the disadvantaged into a poverty trap’.

A total of 2,094 children were followed. All were waiting to move with their families into neighbourhoods with at least 80 per cent of social tenants.

The study will be of particular interest to Education Secretary Michael Gove, who is overseeing a rise in the leaving age to 17 this year and 18 in 2015

These areas are characterised by ‘very high unemployment and extremely low qualification rates, high building density, rooms over-crowding and low house prices’, the report said.

The people who live there are ‘more likely to be depressed, unemployed, cigarette smokers [and] obese’.

Dr Weinhardt used the average performance in the three core subjects - English, maths and science - and combined them to create an overall score with a maximum of 100.

The group that moved into the impoverished areas before their Key Stage 3 exam scored an average of 33. Those that moved in later managed just 33.6.

The data took into account variables such as ‘negative shocks’ that leave better-off families suddenly in need of social housing and other factors including ethnicity, free school meal status and previous test scores.

Dr Weinhardt concluded: ‘The main finding of this study is that early movers into deprived social housing neighbourhoods experience no negative effects on their school attainment relative to late movers.’

The paper is due to be presented today at the Royal Economic Society’s annual conference in London.

It is complemented by another study at the conference which links an increase in the minimum school leaving age with improved academic performance in the next generation.

The children of parents who spend one extra year in education typically achieve one grade higher in two GCSEs or two grades higher in one GCSE than other pupils, it found.

The research was based on the children of 19,966 people affected by the 1972 reform of the school leaving age from 15 to 16.

It will be of particular interest to Education Secretary Michael Gove, who is overseeing a rise in the leaving age to 17 this year and 18 in 2015.

Previous research has found those who remain in education of training until 18 earn more money, are healthier and are less likely to break the law.

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘The research shows that where somebody lives is much less important than what they carry around with them.

‘This includes what their interests are, how much support they get from their parents and how much their parents care about good education - which they can provide directly to their child and by finding them a good school to go to.’
