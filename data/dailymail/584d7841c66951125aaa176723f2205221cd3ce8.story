A strong smell of explosives hung in the air and the streets of Donetsk were eerily quiet as darkness fell tonight.

Gone were the normal sounds of traffic and of the city’s one million residents going about their daily lives - the only noise was the distant rumble of war.

For two days that ominous sound - of heavy shelling and gunfire - has been getting closer as the Ukrainian military try to reclaim the key city from pro-Russian separatists.

The government, embarrassed by its inability to secure the MH17 crash site, is coming down hard on the rebels who formed the Donetsk People’s Republic five months ago.

During the day, a crucial railway bridge leaving the city was blown up, meaning thousands of people who flocked to the train station had to leave and return to their homes.

As the airport has been destroyed by the Ukrainian military, the only other option is by road - a highly dangerous route.

Today, journalists trying to leave were fired upon at military check points by drunken, Kalashnikov-wielding, inexperienced rebels.

Like many others, myself and my colleague, photographer Jamie Wiseman, were trying to leave the city by train after reporting on the horrendous scenes at the MH17 crash site and the shocking fact that the bodies of many victims have yet to be removed.

At the station, one local woman told me: ‘That would have been the last train out of here. I do not know what we will do now.

‘It is very dangerous to drive but we will try.’

I do not know when I will be able to leave and if I can find a driver willing to attempt to try.

For now, the city’s shops have been boarded up and both water and power supplies are failing. During the night, a crucial gas pipe was blown up and the cash machines have run dry.

A curfew operates from 11pm to 6am and anyone caught breaching it carries the risk of arrest or worse.

As I write, the fighting has moved closer into the city, on the roads by the airport and everyone has been told to stay inside and close their windows.

But even with the doors and windows shut, the terrifying, booming sound of artillery can be clearly heard as the city of Donetsk comes closer each minute to descending into a state of full-blown war.

Ukrainian officials have today said their forces advanced to the outskirts of a key town north of the city as they try to retake the stronghold.

The move comes as Ukrainian forces appear to have gained some momentum recently by retaking control of territory from the rebels.

Russia however also appears to becoming more involved in the fighting.

The U.S. and Ukraine have accused Moscow of moving heavy artillery across the border to the rebels.

Ukrainian national security spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Ukrainian forces were outside Horlikva, just north of the regional centre of Donetsk.

Once they can take Horlivka, 'the direct route is open for the forces of the anti-terrorist operation to the capital of the Donbass region - the city of Donetsk,' Lysenko said.

Two military cargo planes, one Dutch and the other Australian, today flew 38 more coffins carrying victims to the Netherlands for identification and investigation

'The approaches to Donetsk are being blocked so that the terrorists do not get the chance to receive ammunition, reinforcements or equipment.'

Donetsk, a city of about 1 million 
people, is a major centre of the separatist uprising that has battled 
Ukrainian government forces for five months.

Nick Clegg has joined calls for Russia to face the axe as hosts of the 2018 World Cup as part of tougher sanctions over the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine.

The Deputy Prime Minister said it was 'unthinkable' at present that the tournament could go ahead in the country blamed by the West for supplying arms to the separatist rebels accused of causing the deaths of all 298 on board.

Football's world governing body Fifa this week ruled out calls from some German politicians for Russia to be boycotted, insisting the tournament could be 'a force for good'.

But Mr Clegg told The Sunday Times that allowing it to go ahead without a change of course by president Vladimir Putin would make the world look 'so weak and so insincere' in its condemnation of Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for the rebels.

Meanwhile, a full-fledged investigation into the shooting down of MH17 still hasn't started because of the security risks posed by the nearby fighting.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials say flight MH17 was shot down by a missile from rebel territory, most likely by mistake.

Two military cargo planes, one Dutch and the other Australian, also today flew 38 more coffins carrying victims to the Netherlands for identification and investigation.

Later, the Dutch government said the first formal identification of a victim had taken place.

The name and sex of the victim, a Dutch national, weren't released.

The planes took off from Kharkiv, a government-controlled city where the bodies have been brought from the wreckage site in territory held by pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian government.

They landed later in the afternoon in Eindhoven, where the coffins were transferred to a fleet of hearses in a solemn ceremony.

Officials said the flights took the last of the 227 coffins containing victims that had been brought to Kharkiv by refrigerated train. Officials say the exact number of people held in the coffins is still to be determined by forensic experts in the Netherlands, where Ukraine agreed to send the bodies.

International observers have said there are still remains at the wreckage site. Access however has been limited due to rebel interference and security concerns.
