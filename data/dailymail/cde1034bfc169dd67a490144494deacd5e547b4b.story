Southampton have opened contract talks with midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin in an attempt to keep him on the south coast beyond the end of the season.

Schneiderlin intimated in an interview in France on Tuesday that he could leave St Mary’s at the end of the season if they fail to qualify for the Champions League.

The deal, which was put to the last week, is under consideration, but the 25-year-old wants various clauses inserted into the new contract.

Saints are desperate to keep him at the club and have offered him a deal in excess of the £2million a year deal he is presently on.

Southampton’s highest earning player is Jose Fonte on £45,000 a week, but Schneiderlin will be offered more to keep him under Ronald Koeman’s wing.

He has established himself as one of the club’s leading players, but he was desperate to quit the club in the summer.

Schneiderlin had a move to Tottenham lined up, but Southampton refused to sell him after the departures of Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw.
