He was one of the prime-time stars of 80s television with his clean-cut comedy routines and impressions.

But Bobby Davro was left appalled rather than entertained when he tuned in to watch fellow comedian Jimmy Carr this week.

Within hours he took to Twitter to vent his disgust at the content of Being Funny on Channel 4.

Davro, 55, who became a star with ITV 
shows including Bobby Davro on the Box, claimed that ‘standards have 
dropped’ after watching Carr’s performance.

‘I can’t believe the joke he told to finish his show,’ he said. ‘I’m sorry but it’s beyond bad taste. Go and see a good panto with comedians that can make a whole family laugh without resorting to foul language. Innuendo not puerile filth!’

He wasn’t the only one to find Carr’s gags a turn-off. Scores of viewers reached for the off switch mid-way through the show despite it being screened after 10pm on Wednesday.

Offensive: Some of Jimmy Carr's 'less crude' jokes

Carr poked fun at the blind, the death of Princess Diana, homosexuals and children, and made a tasteless Holocaust joke.

The show was from his performance at a
 club in Birmingham and Vivienne Pattison, of pressure group 
Mediawatch-UK, said the public reaction highlighted how content for a 
comedy gig was not necessarily suitable for TV – even after the 
watershed.

‘When you’re in a
 club you have to prove that you are 18 or over,’ she said. ‘When it’s 
on TV that’s not the case. It’s offered for public presentation and 
there is no way of knowing what is going to be included. 

‘The fact that people turned off does show this is not what they wanted to see.’

Davro fell out of favour as taste in comedy changed – a point he touched upon during his rant at Carr. ‘We all love a good dirty joke but I’m sorry I would never dream of telling ones so offensive as Jimmy’s,’ he said.

‘I can’t believe that TV allows such filthy material. Why is it so popular to use every expletive going? Standards have dropped.’

Davro’s career downturn coincided with a troubled personal life, including a divorce said to have been caused in part by his desire to get back in the big time. It is a position he has never regained, and this year he will be starring in pantomime in Plymouth.

Davro admitted to a certain envy over Carr’s earnings, but has no wish to follow his path.

‘I wonder if I started to tell jokes like Jimmy Carr that would make me more popular. If I did I think I would be lynched,’ he said.

‘Jimmy Carr is a great comic but I can’t understand how he can tell filthy sexist jokes and be thought of as brilliant.’

He found support on Twitter, with fellow users describing Carr as ‘insensitive’, ‘offensive’ and ‘so over the line, it’s unreal’.

Carr, 41, host of quiz show 8 out of 10 Cats, was criticised by the Prime Minister last year when his use of a controversial Jersey-based tax scheme was revealed. It led to him apologising and withdrawing from the scheme.

TV watchdog Ofcom and Channel 4 confirmed they had received a handful of complaints about Being Funny, which had 780,000 viewers.

A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘This was a repeat of a Jimmy Carr stand-up show, which featured his established brand of humour and was broadcast in a late-night slot. It was preceded by a continuity warning for strong language and adult humour.’
