A little girl who has had three open-heart operations is to be whisked away for a dream holiday at Disneyland.

Ella-Louise Dee, five, could be facing a heart transplant after an attempt to repair the organ failed to have the impact it should have.

As a result, the primary school pupil regularly turns blue and is often breathless, her mother Alice Holton, 23, says.

Ella-Louise Dee, five, was born with a heart defect and has had to have three open-heart operations. She is now also facing the prospect of a heart transplant. She is pictured with her mother, Alice Holton, 23

So to give her a boost while waiting to find out her new treatment plan, friends, family and the local community have got together at two separate charity events to raise £5,000 to send Ella-Louise, Ms Holton and Ella-Louise’s father, Darren Dee, 26, to Disneyland Paris.

Ella-Louise's problems were first spotted at her mother’s 20 week scan during pregnancy.

Ms Holton, from Middlesbrough, said: ‘We found out at Ella-Louise's five month scan that she had a heart defect and the doctors said she would need a heart operation when she was born.

‘I got to hold her for one second and then they took her straight away. It was really hard. They monitored her oxygen saturation and at three weeks old she had her first op.’

Ella-Louise was born with an atrioventricular septal defect which meant there was a hole between the upper filling chambers and the lower pumping chambers of her heart.

It also meant she only had one valve between the atria and ventricles instead of the normal two.

Ella-Louise's parents were told she had a heart defect at her mother's 20 week pregnancy scan

Ella-Louise's family and friends have now raised enough money to take her to Disneyland while they wait to hear what treatment she will need next. She is pictured in hospital

Ella-Louise was at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital for three months before she could go home.

‘She was fine until she needed another operation after a couple of years,’ said Ms Holton.

‘She was very blue and breathless and didn't have much exercise tolerance at all.

‘If she went outside for exercise when she got in her lips would be very blue.

‘It was also noticed on her scan that her valves were getting a bit blocked so they needed to operate.’

Ella-Louise was put on medication and scheduled for another operation in the summer of 2010, when she was one and a half.

Ella-Louise had surgery in 2012 which was meant to be a 'full repair' of her heart but it was unsuccessful

She then had her third open-heart operation in November 2012 which her mother says was supposed to be a ‘full repair’.

But the operation didn't have the required effect and a transplant may now be needed for Ella-Louise who is currently on five types of medication and also has a non-functioning spleen.

‘After that they thought that she'd hopefully not have to have any more operations, but that didn't go to plan,’ said Ms Holton, who is Ella-Louise’s full-time carer.

‘They don't really know what the issue is but she's still really blue and breathless and she's supposed to have gone a lot pinker and have more breath.

‘They are a bit stuck on what to do - it might have to be a transplant now.’

Due to her heart problems Ella-Louise gets very breathless and has a tendency to turn slightly blue

Friends and family organised a pool and darts marathon as well as a charity fun night at The Acklam Garden City - and raised an impressive £5,000.

‘It was absolutely brilliant - a great night,’ said Ms Holton. ‘She got a bit tired at 10pm but she was up dancing and really enjoyed herself.

‘She's a really, really happy little girl who tries to go on the trampoline longer than she should!

‘Sometimes I have to tell her to sit down and calm down but she just wants to be out with the other kids.'

She added: ‘She absolutely loves Disney and we want to create a fantastic memory for her.’
