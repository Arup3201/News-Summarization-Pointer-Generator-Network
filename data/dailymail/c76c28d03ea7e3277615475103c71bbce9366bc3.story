A man and his pet parrot were banned from going on daily walks to the park - because staff believed the colourful bird was a health and safety risk.

The Helix, a new park and recreation zone near Falkirk, Scotland, claims to be 'a place for everyone - even your pets' on its website.

So Tommy Taylor was shocked when security guards demanded he and Green-winged macaw Blaze leave the facility - claiming the South American bird might bite people.Â 

Disappointed: Tommy Taylor and his pet parrot Blaze have been banned from going on daily walks to the park - because staff believed the colourful bird was a health and safety risk

'Security demanded we leave - they said Blaze was a health and safety risk because he might bite people,' said Mr Taylor, a Meatloaf impersonator who often takes his beloved pet for walks on a lead.

'I pointed out there were loads of dogs around, which are far more likely to bite, but they weren't having it.

'Blaze has been going for walks there since he was a chick - before work on The Helix even started.

'He's always on his lead, though, and has never caused anyone hassle. I just don't get it.'

The Helix, which was opened to the public on September 14, claims to be 'a place for everyone' and says it 'welcomes' dogs and horses on its website.

Mr Taylor and Blaze, who live just minutes from venue, were ejected from the park on its opening day - to the disappointment of other visitors.

'Kids and families were wanting pictures taken with Blaze - it happens wherever we go,' he said.

'He's such a lovely bird and always happy to pose. Then these two security guards with hi-vis jackets appeared and told us to stop it.

'It was daft and people were disappointed - it's not as if we were charging for photos or anything.

"People did stop taking pictures, but even that wasn't good enough. It's pure rubbish - he visits care homes, schools and meets hundreds of people every week. He's never hurt anyone.'

He added: 'This is a public park - it was a total humiliation.'

A spokesman for The Helix said 'casual staff' who had been on duty had made a mistake.

He said: 'As it was the opening day, it was very busy with 15,000 visitors. The staff in question thought Blaze might take fright.

'It was a mistake and they should not have been asked to leave.

'We apologise and would like to assure Tommy and Blaze that they're both welcome back any time.'
