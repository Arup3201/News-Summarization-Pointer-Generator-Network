The father of Britain's youngest 
rioter took the 12-year-old out to steal fruit machines two months after
the child was arrested for looting, a court heard.

The boy, who was just 11 when he 
stole a £50 bin in the riots, was helping his heroin addict father get 
money for a fix to stop him being violent, the court heard.

He had been spared jail for stealing the bin but six days later on September 6 he stole a bottle of Coke from a supermarket.

Burglary: The boy and his father stole three fruit machines containing £2,500 from the pub (pictured) in Romford

And Redbridge Youth Court heard yesterday that after being released on bail for that offence the boy was caught on CCTV stealing three fruit machines containing £2,500 from a pub in Romford on November 16, accompanied by his father.

Prosecutor Alex Mattic said the images show the boy handing rocks to his father, who uses them to smash the windows of Yates' Wine Lodge in South Street, Romford.

'CCTV shows him handing rocks to his father who throws them through the windows,' he told the court. 'The burglary takes place. They are seen wheeling out fruit machines, which are then taken away on a van.'

The boy, who pleaded guilty to the burglary on November 19, was arrested at home and taken into secure custody for the first time.

'His father is a heroin addict and 
continuing to use heroin. His father gets violent towards him. For him, 
the best way to help his father is to get him some money to get a fix'

He had been given an 18-month youth rehabilitation order after taking part in the riots, and was already under a previous 'referral order' for offences of arson, criminal damage and carrying a pointed instrument.

Vicky Thompson, defending, said the boy had had a 'wake-up call' after being taken into custody.  The court heard he idolises his dad, who is on remand.

'He is by no means perfect but there is a lot going on in his life. It was his father who took the 12-year-old out to commit this burglary.

'His father is a heroin addict and continuing to use heroin. His father gets violent towards him. For him, the best way to help his father is to get him some money to get a fix.

'He idolises his father for all the wrong reasons. All of his offences have happened during a time when he is in contact with his dad.

'The burglary was when he was on his way home from his father's house. The arson was also when he was on his way back from his father's house.

'He can't deal with the emotions of this difficult relationship.  'His father is a man who has been in and out of trouble for a number of years but hasn't had any real custodial sentence. In [the boy's] mind, he hasn't had any real appreciation of what the impact of the court can be.

'He has had a real wake-up call these last couple of days.'

The court heard the boys mother has been trying to get a High Court order to prevent his father from contacting him.

The case was adjourned until December 7 for pre-sentence reports to be prepared. His bail conditions ban him from seeing his father.

Addressing the 12-year-old, chair of the bench John Dring said: 'You've been in a place you don't like. You know what to do.

'At 12 years old you shouldn't be hard. The bench can see you're not a hard boy and it says that's good. Look at your family behind you.'

The boy said: 'I'm really sorry for what I've done. I know I'm making my family really upset.'

Granting him bail, Mr Dring added: "If you commit another offence you will go straight into secure accommodation. Your future depends on this, the love between you and your mother depends on this. You have a lot to do.'
