Opposition to President Barack Obama's nominee for U.S. ambassador to Norway has grown in Congress to the point where Long Island, New York businessman George Tsunis now says he doesn't plan to pursue the job when the new Congress convenes in January.

Ambassadorial posts require Senate confirmation, and Tsunis's cringe-worthy performance in a January 2014 hearing virtually guaranteed that he wouldn't be getting a thumbs-up. 

Tsunis, chairman of Chartwell Hotels, is a major Democratic fundraiser who plowed $267,244 into party coffers in 2012 – including $75,800 to the Obama Victory Fund – and 'bundled' $988,550 from his business connections to benefit Obama's re-election effort. He also donated $300,000 to Democratic super PACs.

During his Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, however, he bungled questions about Norway's political parties and spoke of the nation's 'president' – even though it is a constitutional monarchy with a king and a prime minister.

Tsunis also claimed that the Progress Party, a Norwegian anti-Islamist party that opposes immigration above a token 1,000 people per year and advocates for AIDS testing for all new arrivals, was a fringe group and nothing more.

'You get some fringe elements that have a microphone and spew their hatred,' he complained.

'And although I will tell you Norway has been very quick to denounce them, we’re going to continue to work with Norway to make sure –'

A stunned Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain interrupted Tsunis to remind him that the Progress Party was considered a mainstream political influence in Oslo.

It's actually the third-largest party in Norway's parliament, and its leader Siv Jensen is the country's current finance minister.

'The government has denounced them?' McCain asked. 'They're part of the coalition of the government.'

'Well, I would say – You know what? I stand, I stand corrected,' a slapped-down Tsunis responded.

That exchange came minutes after McCain asked: 'Mr. Tsunis, have you been to Norway?'

'I have not,' an ashen-faced Tsunis admitted. 

He told reporters in multiple statements over the weekend that senators wouldn't have him to kick around anymore.

'I have elected not to renew my nomination for the next Senate session as I did last year, and will let the nomination expire,' he said in one.

With the ambassadorial slot left unfilled for more than a year, he said the elapsed time was 'too long not to have an ambassador in any country.' 

Minnesota's two Democratic senators, Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar, were among the first to oppose his nomination. Their state is home to large concentrations of Scandinavians expats and multi-generational immigrants from Sweden and Norway.

REALLY? Sen. John McCain was shocked to hear Tsunis claim that a governing-coalition party in Norway was a hate-group that the Norwegian government had denounced

'It's a tight community and we heard from them,' Franken told NPR in June. 'We want diplomats to be pretty good under pressure anyway and he seemed not to be and he displayed a tremendous amount of ignorance about Norway.'

Cornered in June on the question of whether Tsunis and other apparently unqualified nominees should be installed in embassies overseas, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest signalled the Obama administration's intention to stand firm.

'We've got full confidence in their ability to do these jobs,' Earnest said. 'I think it is short-sighted to automatically rule out nominees that aren't career Foreign Service officers.'

'If that were the case, that means that Caroline Kennedy would not be serving as the ambassador to Japan. I think most people, even some Republicans, would agree that she’s doing a pretty good job over there.'

But a group of House Democrats and Republicans insisted over the summer that Tsunis's 'embarrassing lack of knowledge' about Norway made him unqualified.

Hotelier George Tsunis flubbed line after line during his January Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing, drawing eye-rolls from senators on both sides of the political aisle as he struggled to demonstrate why he should be America's ambassador to Norway.

Here are the most memorable gaffes from his limited time on the international stage.

'The answers provided by Mr. Tsunis clearly demonstrate that he is unqualified for this position and may damage an important international bond if confirmed,' wrote 32 lawmakers, including six Democrats, many from the Midwest, home to many Norwegian-Americans.

They said that in light of military aggression from Russian president Vladimir Putin, it was critical for the United States to have a knowledgeable and respected ambassador in a nearby nation like Norway.

'His ill-informed comments deeply offended several Norwegian officials and have caused many to doubt his ability to serve as an effective ambassador,' the lawmakers wrote.

In a separate statement, Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Tom Marino said Obama should do 'what is best for Norway and America, not what is politically expedient for his fundraisers and cronies.'

In March the union that represents U.S. diplomats threatened to sue the State Department unless it released documents attesting to the qualifications of Tsunis and other ambassadorial nominees.  

The American Foreign Service Association said it would ask a court to compel the production of the documents, known as 'Certificates of Demonstrated Competence,' if the department didn't cough them up voluntarily.

The AFSA claimed State had ignored requests to have the documents released under the Freedom of Information Act.

Tsunis's attempt to leap into foreign service from a political fundraising nomination was nothing new: past administrations have rewarded money-men and women with prime ambassadorships for decades.

But President Obama has eclipsed both George Bushes, and Bill Clinton, in that regard, filling an estimated 37 per cent of his ambassadorial posts with fundraising rock stars and other political cronies whose qualifications have been called into question.

Collectively, they were responsible for at least $13.6 million in political donations.

Oslo Mayor Fabian Stang responded to Tsunis's January implosion by telling Norwegian Broadcasting, in an English translation,that it 'would be very sad for Norwegian-American relations if the Norwegian people are made to feel like second-class citizens by getting an unprofessional ambassador. 

'He is surely a fine man and has surely done an excellent [job] for himself and for Obama's election campaign,' Stang said.

'But given what we saw from his hearing, he doesn't seem very interested in Norway.'

A senior White House official told MailOnline on Monday that the administration has no plan for a new personnel announcement that might introduce a new nominee to replace Tsunis.
