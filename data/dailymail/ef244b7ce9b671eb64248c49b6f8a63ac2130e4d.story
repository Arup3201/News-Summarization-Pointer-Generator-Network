The last couple of years have been momentous for Robert Griffin III and he just topped them off by marrying his college sweetheart.

After the lightning quick QB won the Heisman trophy 2011, he went on to win the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year after a star turn with the Redskins in 2012.

But those accolades pale in comparison to what the 23-year-old phenom did while off the field this week.

The Baylor University grad likely said it best on his official Facebook Saturday: ‘The easiest way to say It......BIG DAY!’

Griffin married the lovely Rebecca Liddicoat in a sports star studded Denver, Colorado ceremony that was liberally documented on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

Earlier reports, fueled by the discovery of a Bed, Bath, and Beyond wedding registry in the couple's name, said the football star would be saying I Do in Virginia, near his team's city of Washington, DC.

Though the wedding date proved to be right, the location was wrong.

The wedding actually took place in Colorado, Liddicoat's home state.

Social media accounts of football stars and fans lit up yesterday with photos of the wedding and congratulations to the quarterback.
