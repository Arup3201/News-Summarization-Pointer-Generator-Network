Sickening: A 12-year-old girl's father attacked Brian Jones (pictured) for allegedly pimping the girl out as she was held against her will in his Memphis home

A Tennessee father rescued his daughter from a life of forced prostitution when he tracked down the 12-year-old and beat her alleged pimp with a baseball bat.

The girl's father told police that Brian Jones had forced his daughter to have sex with several men inside his Memphis apartment.

Police documents say the father's struggle occurred when Jones initially refused to give the girl up to her dad.

In fact, reports WMC, Jones is the one who called police. He claimed someone was trying to lock him in a van.

Jones told police that he allowed a man to bring the girl to his apartment and that he was aware she was involved in sexual activity in one of his bedrooms.

He did not admit to pimping the girl out.

The men who had sex with her have not been apprehended.

Jones was booked on charges he held the girl against her will. He remained locked up on $200,000 bond.

Jones' neighbor Curtis Wilson told WMC:

'It's shocking though, when I heard he did that...He was a person always trying to demand women around and stuff, but I didn't know he was that type of person, but I guess you can't trust nobody out here.'

Jones will next appear in court December 1. 

'Scene of the crime': Jones told police only that he allowed a man to bring the girl to his apartment and that he was aware she was involved in sexual activity in one of his bedrooms
