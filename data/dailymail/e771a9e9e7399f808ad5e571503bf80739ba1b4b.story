New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission(TLC) and PETA are throwing a hissyfit after one comedian with a taxi license decided to prank customer's by surprising them with a Burmese python and then filming their reactions.

Comedian Jimmy Failla thought it would be funny to pick up unknowing passengers, throw a python in the backseat, and then get footage of them flipping out on camera.

Failla calls his two-minute short film, 'Snakes in a Cab' after the cult film 'Snakes On a Plane.'

Passengers were mortified and can be seen cursing and yelling on camera. Even though they had to sign a release form after leaving the cab, they certainly weren't happy.

The TLC was not impressed with Failla's prank and he may be getting his license revoked.

'This was monumentally poor judgment on the driver’s part, and we are clearly going to actively question this person’s suitability to continue holding a TLC license,' said Taxi and Limousine Commission spokesman Allan Fromberg.

Failla defended himself by saying,'We’re trying to promote a book and have fun,' he said.

The New York Post reports that according to TLC rules, drivers cannot abuse or harass passengers.

'What kind of cab is this,' said one woman.

'You should have told me you didn’t like snakes!' Failla says to her.

Passengers in Failla's cab were visibly disturbed by the python's presence but all of them signed release forms following the prank and none of them filed complaints.

PETA publicly complained against Failla's prank and suggested that next time he us a rubber snake instead of a live one.

While Failla was a working cabby in 2010, he hasn't worked in a cab for 4 years and says that if the TLC wants his license they can take it.

'I don’t care,' he said. 'It’s the worst job in the world.'
