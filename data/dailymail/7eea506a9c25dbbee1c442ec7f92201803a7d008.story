The Arizona sheriff best known for forcing jail inmates to wear pink underwear and live in tents - as well as 'deputizing' actor Steven Segal and organizing a 'posse' to investigate whether President Barack Obama is a U.S. citizen - announced yesterday that he has put 38 jail inmates on a 'bread and water diet.'

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio - America's self-proclaimed 'toughest sheriff' - issued a press release on Thursday announcing that the 38 inmates will be dining on nothing but bread and water as punishment for 'desecrating the American flag.'

'These inmates have destroyed the American flag that was placed in their cells,' Arpaio says in the release. 'Tearing them, writing on them, stepping on them, throwing them in the toilet, trash or wherever they feel, it's a disgrace to those who have fought for our county [sic]. Besides this is government property that they are destroying, and we will take action against those who act this way.'

'Tough': Sheriff Joe Arpaio has put jail inmates who damaged American flags on a diet of bread and water

Arpaio's bread and water meal plan isn't the only jail-house cuisine served in the Maricopa County jail system - the sheriff also punishes problem inmates by forcing them to eat his 'nutraloaf,' or 'loaf' for short.

Arpaio's loaf is a mash of vegetables, fruit, meat and other nutrients that are blended together and baked into a bread-like loaf.

'Quite frankly, I don't think I'd eat this,' Arpaio said before trying - and gagging on - the loaf during a press conference announcing that federal court had upheld his decision to use it in his jails.

In addition to the news about flags being placed in the cells, and putting those who damage the flags on a diet of bread and water, Arpaio - who is well known for his media gimmicks - announced yesterday that he also requires the inmates to sing The Star-Spangled Banner in the morning and God Bless America at night.

During the holidays, the sheriff traditionally plays Christmas music throughout the jail - 24 hours a day.

The 81-year-old Arpaio has been the sheriff in Maricopa County - which includes the cities of Phoenix and Scottsdale - for more than 20 years. In that time, he has created controversy over his policies on illegal immigrants, targeting his political opponents and abusing power.

Last month, the sheriff was ordered to pay two former newspaper executives $3.75 million after he had them thrown in jail on bogus charges that were almost immediately dropped. The two former executives - Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin - maintain that they were targeted by the vengeful sheriff because their newspaper, the Phoenix New Times, often was critical of the sheriff.

Arpaio also has been the target of a Justice Department investigation into whether he directs his officers to racially profile Latinos for traffic stops.

According to DOJ lawsuit against the sheriff, Arpaio's practices are 'discriminatory and otherwise unconstitutional law enforcement actions 
against Latinos who are frequently stopped, detained and arrested on the
 basis of race, color, or national origin.'

The sheriff also made headlines when a Pulitzer Prize-winning article in the East Valley Tribune newspaper revealed that his office had neglected to investigate several hundred sex crimes reported to his office that occurred in a small, unincorporated town called El Mirage.

Hundreds of victims - including dozens of children who claimed to have been molested - said that they called the sheriff's office about the alleged sexual abuse but they were never investigated.

Critics of the sheriff's immigration policies say that he spends too much time chasing illegal immigrants - which is not technically in his job description, but helps earn him votes during election years - and not enough time policing unincorporated parts of the county or serving felony warrants, both of which are in his job description.

Arpaio says he plans to run for yet another term as the county's top law enforcement officer. He'll be 85 years old the next time there is an election for sheriff in Maricopa County.
