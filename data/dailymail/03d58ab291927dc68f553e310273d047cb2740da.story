A newlywed who plans on ending her life after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer says her works towards legalizing doctor assisted suicide - and not children - will be her legacy.

Brittany Maynard, 29, of Portland, Oregon, who has stage 4 glioblastoma, released a heartbreaking video last week discussing her desire to die with dignity while also encouraging other states to make the practice of doctor assisted suicide legal.

Now, in a new interview, she is responding to critics who are calling her decision selfish, while also explaining how her fight to make it legal for others to die on their own terms will be what she leaves behind when she passes away.

Gine to soon: Maynard was diagnosed with the cancer after being married to her husband (above) for just one year

Maynard found out about her condition this spring, and was told by doctors she may only have six months to live.

She now plans on taking the pills that will end her life at her home on November 1, just six days after her husband's birthday. 

Her biggest regret however is that she will never get to have a family.

'I'd say most of my sadness centers around how much I wanted a family,' Maynard told CBS This Morning. 

'And it feels like for me, that was always, like, how you created a legacy was, like, through your children. And sort of inadvertently -- through sharing my story, I've realized there's a bit of the legacy I'm creating this way and I'm not ashamed of that. I'm not ashamed to attach my name to what I think is a right that should belong to all terminally ill Americans.'

Staying positive: Maynard has made it clear she does not want to die, but rather wants to make sure she goes on her own terms, before she has great pain and is a burden to those around her

The young woman is also making it clear to her detractors that she ultimately does not want to end her life, she just sees no other choice, especially given what her quality of life would be should she fight this diagnosis.

'I don't want to die," Maynard explained.

'If anyone wants to hand me, like, a magical cure and save my life so that I can have children with my husband, you know, I will take them up on it.' 

She then added, 'I think until anyone has walked a mile in my shoes and knows what they're facing and has felt the - like, just bone-splitting headaches that I get sometimes, or the seizures, or the inability to speak, or the moments where I'm looking at my husband's face and I can't think of his name.'

Devastated mother: Deborah Ziegler (above), who raised Maynard on her own, told her daughter she would happily attend to her daughter and feed her and change her diapers if she changed her mind

In the same interview, her mother, Deborah Ziegler, who raised Maynard on her own, talks about the discussion she had about her daughter when she learned of her decision.

'Early on, I told her, "It would be my honor to take care of you, whichever way; if you need to be fed or diapered, it would be my honor,"' she said.  

'And that was important for me, for her to know.' 

Maynard's husband, Dan Diaz, also talked about how sad he is that he will not get to spend the rest of his life with the woman he married just over one year ago.

'That was the original plan, right?' he said. 

'But the reality that, I guess, that feeds into the argument of quality of life versus just quantity.' 

Final farewell: Maynard plans to end her life on November 1, just six days after her husband's birthday

Family and friends: Maynard has said she will die in her own room surrounded by her husband, mother, stepfather and best friend

And Maynard will not see cancer ultimately defeat her, or watch herself lose her quality of life and burden those around her.

'No, cancer is ending my life,' she said. 

'I am choosing to end it a little sooner and in a lot less pain and suffering.'
