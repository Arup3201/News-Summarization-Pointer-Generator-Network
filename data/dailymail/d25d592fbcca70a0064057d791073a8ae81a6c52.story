Fast food fans, beware: Next time you want a takeaway from your favourite restaurant chain you may get more than you bargained for.

Some of the nation's most popular fast food shops have been found with mice living in the kitchens, and droppings on shelves and cooking equipment.

Details obtained from official reports by local authority hygiene officers have revealed some of the most shocking - and in some cases dangerous - fast food restaurants across the UK.

This chart shows how the major fast food chains scored, based on the Food Standards Agency hygiene rating. The top half shows the average score (out of five) taken from various restaurant ratings across the country. The bottom half shows the lowest score an individual restaurant in a chain received

The food safety officer from a local authority inspects a business to see how hygienically the food is handled, the condition of the building and how it keeps food safe.

It is then rated from zero to five.Â 

Some of the worst offenders included:

Domino's Pizza London - 0/5: Mouse droppings found on shelves, equipment and surfaces; employee found sleeping on packaging

KFC Islington - 0/5: The council refused the FOI request

Wimpy Welling Kent - 0/5: Same surfaces and utensils used for raw and cooked food; lettuce stored in a bucket

Chicken Cottage Aylesbury - 0/5: Lack of dating on food suggested no way of telling when food went out of date

Papa Johns Maidenhead - 1/5: Unclean kitchen and excessive amounts of rubbish at rear of premises

Burger King Brent Cross - 2/5: Mouse found on the premises and structural repairs needed to control pest issues

McDonalds Leicester - 2/5: Dirty freezers, mould found in sinks and employees not washing their their hands

Chicken Cottage was found to be the UK's 'most disgusting' food chain after receiving the lowest average
score during official hygiene inspections - it was also found to be the
most dangerous with 71 gang-related crimes reported at a Ladbroke Grove
branch in London alone.

The information was collected by a Sussex-based health and safety firm Tutorcare using Freedom of Information requests.

The findings also discovered mouse droppings on shelves and equipment in a London branch of Domino's Pizza, and the same utensils being used in a Wimpy in Kent to handle raw and cooked food.

Despite pest control problems in the Brent Cross branch of Burger King, the chain was branded the 'least disgusting' for receiving the highest average score across all of its branches in hygiene tests.

Tutorcare compiled information from various requests for hygiene inspection scores to create the national average.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) issues guidelines to local authorities with a hygiene rating score out of five.

The Chicken Cottage chain achieved a three overall, while Wimpy was second from bottom with an average score of four. Papa Johns scored slightly higher than Chicken Cottage.

Across the board KFC, McDonalds, Burger King and Domino's Pizza all received an average score of between four and five with Burger King scoring the highest at 4.85.

The lowest hygiene score obtained by a single Chicken Cottage, KFC, Wimpy and Domino's branch was zero out of five.

Papa Johns had a lowest score of one, while McDonalds and Burger King branches' lowest rating was two.

Commenting on the findings, managing director of Tutorcare, Gareth Jones told MailOnline: 'Every restaurant must ensure that the food they serve and sell is safe to eat, this should be the cornerstone of any food related business. Food safety must always come ahead of profit.'

Tutorcare also pulled out specific examples of poor hygiene in the lowest scoring branches.

The Food Hygiene Inspection Report indicated that Chicken Cottage in Aylesbury had numerous failings which gave it the Food Hygiene Rating of zero.

The first issue identified by the inspecting Environmental Health Officer was the lack of dating on food in the chiller. This meant employees had no way to tell how long meats had been stored in the fridge and consequently had no way to know if the meat they were storing was past its use by date.

Secondly the inspecting officer noted that there was no soap at the hand wash area, raising serious concerns that employees may have been handling food that would be sold to customers, without having washed their hands.

During hygiene inspections by the Food Standards Agency, mouse droppings were found in a London branch of Domino's Pizza, out of date food was said to be discovered at Chicken Cottage in Aylesbury and Papa Johns in Maidenhead was unclean

The lowest performing branch of Domino's was located in London - although the precise location was not revealed. It had some 'particularly notable failings' when the food safety officer for the area visited at the end of April 2013.

The officer located a significant amount of mouse droppings on the premises including on shelves, surfaces and under equipment. The officer also noted that the standard of cleanliness throughout the facility was poor.

A staff member was additionally found sleeping on the premises on the food packaging.

On 8 July, a visiting food safety inspector recommended some structural repairs and improvements at the Burger King in Brent Cross Shopping Station to reduce the risk of pest issues.

Despite pest problems in a Brent Cross branch of Burger King, the chain was branded the 'least disgusting' for getting the highest average score across all of its branches in hygiene tests. Tutorcare also found specific examples of poor hygiene in the lowest scoring branches, pictured

However, when a mouse was caught on the premises during the evening of 17 July the inspector noted that the recommended alteration remained outstanding.

The lowest scoring UK branch of Papa Johns was found in Maidenhead.

The inspecting food safety officer raised particular concerns that there seemed to be a number of men who did not appear connected with the business present in the preparation area without reason to be there or the necessary clean/protective clothing to prevent food contamination.

A number of issues attributed to McDonalds in Leicester receiving a food hygiene rating of two out of five.

The inspecting food safety officer specifically mentioned the appearance of mould in the sealant at the back of both the hand washing trough and the equipment sink, and holes in the wall of the boiler room which could lead to pest problems.
