Rio Ferdinand selects his three young stars to shine and set the world alight in Brazil this summer.

JAMES RODRIGUEZ  (Colombia and Monaco)

I’m looking forward to seeing what this kid can do. He’s a 22-year-old attacking midfielder with great balance, a turn of pace and a nice left foot.

He’s that rare talent — someone who gets you off your seat. The only downside is that clubmate and Colombia co-star Radamel Falcao is out injured. Falcao would have created the space for Rodriguez to thrive. But then the absence of Falcao is perhaps Rodriguez’s chance to take centre stage.

Time to shine: With Falcao injured, James Rodriguez could step up and deliver for Colombia

PAUL POGBA(France and Juventus)

I know from his time at Manchester United that Pogba is ridiculously talented and it is unfortunate that a complicated contract situation meant he left. I was sorry to see him go. Everyone at United knew he was going to be a super player when he arrived at 16 from Le Havre.

He told me before he left he wants to be the best player in the world. He said it deadpan but meant it. He is like Patrick Vieira, only more skilful with a greater range of abilities. That’s how highly I rate him.

Rising star: Juventus' Paul Pogba has earned a reputation as one of the brightest young players in Europe

In the middle: Pogba's energy and technique will be crucial for France this summer

JULIAN DRAXLER (Germany and Schalke)

I hope he gets some time on the field among the many talents Germany have. He has fine feet and a great imagination.

He is only 20, but he has been playing regularly in the Bundesliga for more than two years. He has an eye for goal, evident back in May 2011 when he scored an absolute peach for Schalke in a German cup final win with a long-range volley. He has a big future.

Breakthrough: Julian Draxler is on the fringes of the Germany first XI but played regularly in the Bundesliga
