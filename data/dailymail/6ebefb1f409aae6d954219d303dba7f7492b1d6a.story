At just 13ft wide, this tiny house may be one of the smallest in Britain.

Spread over two floors, the detached property features all the mod cons needed for comfortable living but most definitely suits a single owner.

The house in Bridgwater, Somerset, has gone on the market for the not so tiny price tag of £74,950 and despite being on the small side viewers have travelled more than 150 miles to take a look.

Small but perfectly formed: The tiny house has been converted from a garage and is just 13ft wide

Size isn't everything: The ground floor features a combined sitting/kitchen and dining room

Not a good size: The top floor is big enough to fit a double bed but not suitable for the tall homeowner

Estate agent Mark Franklin of Tamlyns said there has already been considerable interest in the home.

He said the two-storey house, converted from a garage, is one of the most unusual they have seen.

Despite its diminutive nature, the home has a sitting/dining/kitchen room, a rear hall and bathroom on the ground floor and a double bedroom on the first floor.

It even boasts its own courtyard at the back.

Mr Franklin said: 'We had someone come all the way down from Surrey to see it.

'There has been interest in it.

'It's very unusual - I've never dealt with anything quite like it before.

'It would suit a single person. There'll be somebody out there it would suit.'

Although the price may seem high for such a small property, it represents a real bargain when compared to the cost of other properties in the area.

It is in the Sedgemoor district, where the average price of a flat is £96,730 or £279,612 for a detached house.

The property is currently occupied by
a tenant, on an assured short hold tenancy agreement, paying it is 
understood, £400.00 per calendar month.

They have indicated they would 
like to stay on for the long term, having lived there for over a year 
already.

The estate agents said the unusual house is a perfect first-time buy.

'Further benefits' include double glazing, electric heating and a view of the canal.

They do warn, however, that there is 'restricted head height' in the bedroom.

Compact: The house only has one room upstairs but has enough space downstairs for a kitchen and bathroom
