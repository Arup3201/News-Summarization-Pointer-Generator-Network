A nine-year-old boy has become a victim of internet censors in China after writing a letter to the country's President telling him to lose some weight.

A note  written by a primary school pupil Niu Ziru appeared on social media addressed to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, outlining his idea for the country to go on a space mission to Mars.

But at the end of the letter, the student decided to give some health advice, saying: 'You could lose some weight. You don't have to look as skinny as Obama. Like Putin is okay!'

Schoolboy Niu Ziru, nine, has been censored by the Chinese authorities after a letter he wrote for homework, in which he said the country's leader 'could lose some weight', was posted online 

The note, which was done as part of a homework assignment, was never posted, but it was uploaded to Chinese sites by the child's father, and went viral.

Users reposted the note across social media, and it eventually appeared on the sites of Zhengzhou Evening News and the state-owned Xinhua news agency.

The boy's parents and his school in Zhengzhou said they did not expect his letter to receive so much attention.

His teacher, Eileen Wang, told Sky News: 'It was weekend homework, for his Chinese assignment. A letter [written] to anyone or anything. He is a good student.

'At our school, students are welcomed to speak up... so they have crazy ideas like this.' 

Niu wrote the letter to encourage Chinese leader Li Jinping to create a space mission to Mars, but ended by saying he needed to go on a diet, adding: 'You don’t have to look as skinny as Obama. Like Putin is okay'

However it seems that the Chinese authorities have failed to share the joke.

The story is now missing from all news websites, while links to the stories on other websites appear to be broken or deleted.

On blogging site Weibo a search for Niu Ziru brings up no results, while search engine Baidu is also unable to find either the story or the boy.

Niu told the Zhengzhou Evening News that he had seen Xi and other leaders during the recent Asian leaders summit, and thought Xi had 'made Chinese people proud, except that he's a bit fat.'

Dear Grandpa Xi Jinping,

Greetings! I’m a pupil from Zhengzhou, Henan Province. Today I want to talk to you about space. 

Everyone believes the next big challenge is space. I think so too. The moon, for sure has rich minerals, but it doesn’t have air and water and is definitely not suitable for human life. 

This is not a good place for a long stay. It’s time for China’s aerospace program to change directions.

Let’s have a look at Mars. It has both air and glaciers, it's just as good a place as Earth. 

Eventually, the United States and Russia will no longer use the international space station and the US and Russia are planning full force to land on Mars. 

Even the European Union and India are joining the fun. Let’s also hurry up!

Okay, let's move on to some lighter subjects. Xi Dada, you could lose some weight. You don’t have to look as skinny as Obama. Like Putin is okay!

Best regards,

Wishing you good health

Niu Ziru
