Eddie Howe admits he is saddened by the demise of the FA Cup at the expense of the Barclays Premier League, but believes the competition will rise again once more.

The Bournemouth manager, whose Championship-topping side take on top flight Aston Villa on Sunday in the fourth round, grew up in the 1980s when the FA Cup was considered more prestigious than league competition. 

But now the giant of the Premier League and the financial rewards of the competition has eclipsed that.

Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe believes the FA Cup needs to return to its 'proper position'

‘That is sad,’ Howe said, ‘when you’ve been brought up around the FA Cup and that’s the big competition. All those days that are talked about, those historic days in the competition.

‘It’s sad that with all the tweaks to the competition and the changes which have been made it’s not the prominent cup that it once was.

‘The Premier League now has definitely taken priority, in my eyes. That’s a shame. But I think it can be temporary. I’d love to think the FA Cup will come back. I think it can.’

Howe added: ‘There’s still a lot of love for the competition in the country. I know a lot of managers feel as I do that it’s still got a really important role to play in English football. I’d love to see it put back in its proper position.’
