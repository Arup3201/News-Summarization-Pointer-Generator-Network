Brendan Rodgers has revealed that Liverpool star Raheem Sterling is extremely close to signing a new deal with the club.

Negotiations with the 20-year-old, whose current contract expires in June 2017, have been ongoing for much of the season.

And with rumours of Real Madrid circling, supporters will be pleased to hear Sterling is finally ready to commit his future to the Anfield club.

Liverpool have been in contract negotiations with Sterling, whose current deal expires in 2017, for months

'It (his contract) is something the club are speaking with his representatives on and I would think that would be concluded very imminently,' said Rodgers.

'The player is very happy. It (the delay) is nothing to do with Raheem, he wants to be here so hopefully we get the solution on that very soon.'

The former QPR youth team winger joined the club for just £500,000 plus add-ons in 2010 but has experienced a meteoric rise to prominence in the last 18 months. 

And in the absence of the now-departed Luis Suarez and injured Daniel Sturridge, Sterling has proved himself to be Liverpool's key player this season.
