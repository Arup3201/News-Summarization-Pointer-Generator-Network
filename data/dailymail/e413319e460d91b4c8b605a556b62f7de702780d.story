Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong offered a six-figure donation to the same doping agency that ruled he used illegal substances at the height of his career - causing him to be stripped of his seven Tour de France titles.

The chief of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said that a representative for the cyclist offered the agency in excess of $150,000 several years before the doping investigation.

The agency’s CEO Travis Tygart said he was stunned to have been offered the donation in 2004, calling it 'totally inappropriate' and said they did not hesitate to turn it down.

More allegations: The chief of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said that a representative for Armstrong offered the agency in excess of $150,000 several years before the doping investigation

Tygart spoke to CBS's 60 Minutes Sports, telling Scott Pelley the whole story of the agency's investigation of Armstrong for the first time.

'I was stunned,' the CEO said. 'It was a clear conflict of interest for USADA. We had no 
hesitation in rejecting that offer,' adding the amount was 'in excess of $150,000'. 

When Pelley said they learned it had been a $250,000 donation, Tygart said: 'It was around that ballpark.'

Armstrong's attorney, Tim Herman, denied such an offer was made, saying: 'No truth to that story. First Lance heard of it was today. He never made any 
such contribution or suggestion.'

Armstrong once gave the International Cycling Union, a regulatory body for his sport, a gift of $100,000.

The U.S. Department of Justice is 
considering whether to join a federal whistle-blower lawsuit filed by 
former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis alleging fraud against the U.S. 
Postal Service during the years the agency sponsored Armstrong's teams.

Tygart said the Justice Department refuses to charge Armstrong for using illegal substances to enhance his performance and will not share the results of the investigation with the USADA.

Armstrong's attorney, Tim Herman, denied such an offer was made, saying: 'No truth to that story. First Lance heard of it was today. He never made any such contribution or suggestion'

The CEO describes Armstrong and his 
team of doctors, coaches and riders as similar to a 'mafia' that kept 
their secret for years and intimidated riders into silently following 
their illegal methods. 

He said the riders were the victims, forced to choose between following the doping program or being off the team.

It was rumored at the weekend that 
Armstrong was considering coming clean about the doping - a sharp change
of course after years of denials

The New York Times, citing anonymous 
sources, reported late on Friday that Armstrong has told associates he 
was thinking about the move.

But
his attorney said the cyclist hasn't reached out to USADA chief 
executive or David Howman, director general of the World Anti-Doping 
Agency.

Public confessions and apologies have been the route of redemption for several athletes who have gotten in trouble.

For example, Tiger Woods said he was 
sorry for cheating on his wife in televised speech, and baseball slugger
Mark McGwire eventually admitted to steroid use. Yet Armstrong faces 
serious legal entanglements those megastars didn't, and a confession to 
doping could end up complicating matters for Armstrong - not making them
easier.

A Dallas-based promotions company has 
also said it wants to recover several million dollars paid to Armstrong 
in bonuses for winning the Tour de France. And the British newspaper The
Sunday Times is suing to recover about $500,000 paid to Armstrong to 
settle a libel lawsuit.

Despite damning evidence Armstrong has yet to admit any wrongdoing including partaking in doping or offering a six-figure donation to the USADA

Armstrong has testified under oath 
that he never used performance-enhancing drugs, which could 
theoretically lead to charges if he confessed.

Former U.S. track star 
Marion Jones spent several months in federal prison for lying to 
investigators about her drug use.

And after so many years of vehement 
denials and sworn statements that he never doped, at this point, Armstrong would not gain anything from the confession.

Gene Grabowski, executive vice 
president of Levick, a Washington, D.C.-based crisis and issues 
management firm, said 'it may be too little, too late because he's been 
denying it for so long.'

A confession would only work to 
salvage Armstrong's reputation if he accepted full responsibility and 
blamed no one else, Grabowski said. And it would have to include some 
public act of atonement.

'If he does all three, he has a shot,' Grabowski said. 'You have to show people you are willing to pay a price.'

The New York Times reported the 
41-year-old Armstrong may be considering a confession in an attempt to 
reduce his lifetime ban from cycling and Olympic sport so he can return 
to competing in triathlons and elite running events.

Armstrong lost most of his personal 
sponsorship worth tens of millions of dollars after USADA issued its 
report and he left the board of the Livestrong cancer-fighting charity 
he founded in 1997. He is still worth about a reported $100 million.

Livestrong might be one reason to 
issue an apology. The charity supports cancer patients and still faces 
an image problem because of its association with its famous founder.

And if Armstrong did confess, the corporate sponsors who abandoned him might support him again, Grabowski said.

Armstrong was accused last October of running 'the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen'

'They'll do what the public does,' Grabowski said.

Betsy Andreu, the wife of former 
Armstrong teammate Frankie Andreu, was one of the first to publicly 
accuse Armstrong of using performance-enhancing drugs.

She dismissed a potential confession from Armstrong as self-serving and too late.

'Sorry, your chance is over. You're 
banned for life. It's not with an asterisk, that because you are Lance 
Armstrong you get to come back,' Andreu said. 'He does not belong in 
sport.'

According to the code, an athlete might be eligible for a reduced punishment if he fully confesses and details how he doped, who helped him dope and how he got away with doping.

Armstrong has been keeping a low profile since doping revelations ruined his once illustrious career and reputation.

In November he was spotted canoeing in the warm Pacific waters just off Hawaii. The holiday island has become a regular destination for Armstrong to seek refuge, as he throws himself into training for Ironman Triathlon events.

An Ironman Triathlon consists of a 
2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and a marathon 26.2-mile run, 
raced in that order and without a break. Most Ironman events have a 
strict time limit of 17 hours to complete the race.
