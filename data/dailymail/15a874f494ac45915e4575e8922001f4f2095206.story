An obsessive Star Trek fan has spent $500,000 transforming the basement of his home into a replica of the Starship Enterprise.

Anthony Sforza, 48, from Long Island, New York, has been collecting memorabilia from the cult show since the 1980s. 

However, in 2010, Sforza decided to convert his basement into the interior of Captain Jean Luc Picard's space ship.

Outside, the house looks like an ordinary family home similar to thousands of others on Long Island

But inside, the house has been transformed into a copy of the space ship captained by Jean Luc Picard 

The father-of-two spent 1,500 hours over the past three years on the massive redesign. 

He said: 'It was very difficult at first to find materials that they used on the show.

'I tried to call them but getting an answer was impossible.

'Fortunately I was able to purchase a piece of the original set which I pulled apart to find out the exact paint and materials that were used - that's how I created the basement.' 

Sforza's two sons Michael and Daniel are impressed by their father's hard work.

Among Sforza's proudest possessions is this transporter control unit which unfortunately does not work

Anthony Sforza even installed windows into his Starship allowing him to look out into deep space 

Daniel, 7 said: 'I think that it's cool because he has all the belts and badges and everything is here to show just how much he loves Star Trek.'

His 11-year-old son Michael, added: 'I would love to do something like this when I'm older - it would be pretty cool and I think it would be a good addition to any home.'

But not everybody in the family is as enthusiastic about Sforza's unusual obsession.

His sister Marion, 44, thinks his behaviour is a little odd.

She said: 'Anthony's been obsessed with Star Trek for as long as I think I've been alive.

'I don't remember him ever not being obsessed with it, even when he was a little boy.

'I think he's a freak, but he loves it and he could be into worse things so if that's what makes him happy then that's great.'

Sforza's wife, Annette, pictured, said she is incredibly proud of her husband for his sci-fi vision 

Among Sforza's collection are several life sized models featuring characters from the hit TV show

In case of a visit by the Borg, Sforza has a display case with several phasers ready to repel boarders 

Despite spending so much time constructing his spaceship interior - which is modelled on the NX-01 from the show's latest incarnation, Enterprise - Anthony still has the full support of his wife Annette, 46.

She said: 'When Anthony first told me his vision for the basement I couldn't see it the way he did until he started building it.

'Once that started happening we all started getting very excited because we were seeing his vision come to fruition.

'I think it's wonderful, I admire him so much for being able to put vision into something like this and for it to look so incredible - it's wonderful and I'm so proud of him.'
