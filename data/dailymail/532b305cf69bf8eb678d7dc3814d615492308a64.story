NBC has caused yet more outrage over its decision to cut a tribute for the victims of the London 2005 terrorist bombings from its Olympics Opening Ceremony coverage by explaining it wasn't tailored for the U.S. audience.

A tribute song, Abide With Me by singer 
Emeli Sandé, and an accompanying dance was edited out of NBC's coverage 
in favour of a bland Ryan Seacrest interview with Olympic swimmer 
Michael Phelps

'Our programming is tailored for the U.S. audience,' spokesman Greg Hughes simply explained after outrage over the weekend. 'It's a tribute to [producer] Danny Boyle that it required so little editing.'

The excuse comes despite the fact that the devastating attack - which killed 52 people and left many with life-changing injuries - was mourned across the globe and claimed the life of a New Yorker.

Ignored: NBC has sparked outrage by cutting a tribute performance to the victims of the 2005 London terrorist bombings in its coverage of the Olympic Opening Ceremony

Cut: The moving tribute included a performance by singer Emeli Sande of Abide 
With Me

Vietnamese-born Michael Matsushita had moved from the Bronx to live with his fiance in London and was killed in one of the four explosions on public transport on July 7, 2005 - attacks known as '7/7'.

The latest excuse will no doubt annoy Americans, who NBC suggested would not be interested in a tribute to victims just because the tragedy did not occur in their country.

'Can you imagine the BBC opting to cut 
out a tribute to 9/11 at a future Olympics held in the States because it
 wasn't "tailored for a UK audience"?' Daily Kos fumed.

'If that happened...
the switchboards at BBC Broadcasting House would have blown a fuse.'

The segment's choreographer and dancer Akram Khan said he was 'disheartened and disappointed' that NBC cut the entire 
segment, while his director Nicholas Wolaver branded it 'disgraceful'.

Victim: Michael Matsushita, who grew up in New York, was one of the 52 victims killed in the 7/7 bombings in London. He is pictured with his fiancee Rosie Cowan

Moving montage: The faces of spectators' loved ones who have passed away, including the victims of 7/7, were flashed up on big screens around the Olympic Stadium and on TV

Twitter very quickly became awash 
with comments demanding to know why the broadcaster - which has exclusive rights to broadcasting in the U.S. - chose to cut out the performance.

Scott
 Carruthers said: 'NBC cut tribute to the 7/7 victims from 
#olympicceremony coverage, shocking considering we honour the 9/11 
victims at every opportunity.'

Dave
 Hogg tweeted: 'NBC skilled a tribute to servicemen and the 7/7 victims 
to show Seacrest interviewing Phelps. That's horrendous'.

Tamsin Wood added: 'So NBC 
cut out our tribute to the 7/7 victims for a stupid interview!! Rude and
 disrespectful on so many levels!! #openingceremony.'

NBC
 is known for cutting away for small portions of the opening ceremonies 
to make way for averts, but U.S. commentators say they have never 
heard of it skipping a whole performance before.

In an earlier statement, NBC said: 'We are live
 streaming every sporting event, all 32 sports and all 302 medals… The 
opening and closing ceremonies, however, are entertainment spectacles.

Furious: Viewers took to Twitter to voice their disgust at NBC's decision to cut the tribute from its coverage

Angry: Many viewers were demanding to know why NBC chose to cut an entire performance

'Our
 award-winning production team will present them on a medium that best 
demonstrates their grandeur and majesty, and at a time when friends and 
family are able to gather together to watch, which is in prime time.'

The BBC had 
introduced the segment by saying: 'Ladies and gentlemen, please pause 
silent for our memorial wall for friends and family who can't be here 
tonight.

'The excitement of that moment in 
Singapore seven years ago when England won the games was tempered the 
next day with sorrow from the events of July 7 that year. A wall of 
remembrance for those no longer here to share in this event.'

The screens then showed a montage 
of images of spectators' loved ones who have passed away, including the 
late fathers of Danny Boyle, the show's director and London 2012 chief 
Lord Coe.

Dancers dressed in
 red, representing the struggle between life and death, were picked out 
by a spotlight as the powerful vocals of 
Sande pierced the air with Abide With Me.

This
 was followed by the procession of the 204 countries taking part and the
 lighting of the cauldron to signal the start of the Games.

It is not the only controversy surrounding a tribute at the opening ceremony, after it emerged the International Olympic Committee had declined a request to hold a moment of silence to acknowledge the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches killed by Palestinian gunmen at the Munich Olympics in 1972.

NBC's
 Bob Costas called the decision insensitive during an interview and 
indicated he would call for his own moment of silence when Israeli 
athletes marched into the Olympic Stadium on Friday.

Costas'
 comments took his bosses by surprise. Jim Bell, executive producer of 
the NBC's telecast, said this week that Costas hadn't brought it up with
 him before the interview.

As
 the athletes marched in Friday, Costas said that IOC President Jacques 
Rogge led a moment of silence for the late Israelis this week before 
about 100 people at the Athlete's Village.

'Still,
 for many, tonight with the world watching is the true time and place to
 remember those who were lost and how and why they died,' Costas said.
