Real Madrid have sent their English Galactico groundsman Paul Burgess to sort out the pitches they will have to play on during the Club World Cup after serious concerns that their players would be risking injury on sub-standard surfaces.

Madrid are due to fly out to Morocco on December 14 for the seven-team tournament that could see them win their fourth trophy of the year but there are real concerns that their season will be derailed by serious injury to top players because of the state of the pitch at Rabat where they play their semi-final on December 16 against the winner of Cruz Azul from Mexico and Western Sydney Wanderers.

Real ‘signed’ Burgess from Arsenal in 2009 after he had excelled in the Premier League and Madrid saw him as the cure for on-going problems with their own Santiago Bernabeu pitch.

Real Madrid are concerned their players could pick up injuries playing on poor quality pitches

He has produced the perfect playing surface in Madrid for Manuel Pellegrini, Jose Mourinho and now Carlo Ancelotti but he also inspects the pitches Madrid have to play on beyond Spanish borders. 

Burgess visited the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium which is home to FAR Rabat at the end of October and returned and was not impressed with what he saw. The venue will host the first three matches of the tournament and then Madrid’s semi-final.

Burgess is over-seeing urgent repair work on the playing surface which Real’s potential rivals in the World Club Cup final, San Lorenzo, will not have to play on because they play their semi-final in Marrakech where the final will also be held.

Burgess was responsible for the immaculate pitch at Highbury before moving to Spain to join Real Madrid

On Burgess’ advice Madrid have asked Fifa to allow them to arrive just two days before they play their first game in Morocco enabling them to fit another training session in at their own Valdebebas training ground and not in Rabat.

It is not unusual for Burgess to inspect conditions before Real Madrid have to play – he also flies to the United States ahead of pre-season tours to check facilities and pitch standards.

The three-times winner of the Premier League Groundsman of the year award at Arsenal joined the Gunners in 1996 as an 18-year-old after starting his career at Blackpool. He took over as head groundsman of Arsenal’s former home Highbury four years later before Madrid swooped in 2009.
