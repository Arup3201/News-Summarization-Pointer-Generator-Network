Containing fancy dress costumes and what appear to be a gas mask and a purple bong, this is a suitcase taken on a trip enjoyed by Prince Harry before his infamous visit to Las Vegas.

The picture shows a case belonging to Harry's multi-millionaire best friend Arthur Landon, and it suggests that the Royal's time in Sin City may have been preceded by an even wilder week of partying in the British Virgin Islands.

Before Harry and his friends arrived in Vegas, they spent a week on Necker, the private island of Sir Richard Branson, whose son Sam was celebrating his 27th birthday.

And judging by the picture of Mr Landon's suitcase - one of several photographs posted on Facebook about the trip - their intention was to celebrate in style.

Mr Landon, 30, who is one of Britain's richest young men with an estimated £200million fortune, posted the picture with the accompanying caption: '2x flip flops, 3x board shorts, 8x fancy dress outfits, 1x toothbrush, 1x toothpaste, 10x awesomeness…'

Other items in the picture which he didn't mention included Captain Britannia and storm trooper costumes.

A purple object, which appears to be a bong used for smoking, is also shown.

Three days later, Mr Landon posted 
another photograph on Facebook showing a member of the group wearing a 
pair of Bermuda shorts apparently passed out in the sand.

The picture was posted with the caption: 'The perfect start...

Mr Landon, who is very close to the prince, is the son of Austro-Hungarian Princess Katalina Esterhazy de Galantha and the late Brigadier Tim Landon — known as the White Sultan or Landon of Arabia.

A former SAS officer, Tim made his fortune when he helped his Sandhurst friend Qaboos bin Said Al Said overthrow his father in Oman.

Tom Inskip, another of Harry's friends, and Cressida Bonas, whom the prince is said to have dated, are also understood to have been on the trip.

Miss Bonas, a Leeds University graduate, uploaded a picture of herself wearing a pink wig.

It is believed that many of the group
flew back to Britain after their stay in Necker, but Harry, Mr Landon 
and Mr Inskip went on to the U.S.

The
group were put up at the five-star Wynn casino complex in a 
three-bedroom Wynn Encore Tower suite which costs a cool £5,100 a night.

It
was after that hotel stay that naked pictures of Harry emerged - 
photographs that have been viewed by more than 40 million people across 
the globe.

Mr Landon today called the girl who sold the naked pictures 'despicable'.

He said the incident 'put a real dampener' on their trip to Sin City and confirmed the culprit was one of 15 bikini-clad women in a VIP suite when the prince was playing 'strip billiards'.

Mr Landon added that it was an abuse of the third in line to the throne's 'hospitality' by someone the prince and friends met in the hotel and invited back to his room to ‘continue the party’.

The prince was photographed  on a mobile phone wearing nothing but a distinctive necklace giving a topless girl a 'bear-hug' with his bottom facing the camera.

In another picture he cups his hands to protect his modesty while his nude companion hides behind him.

Witnesses said that the prince later disappeared with his playmate.
