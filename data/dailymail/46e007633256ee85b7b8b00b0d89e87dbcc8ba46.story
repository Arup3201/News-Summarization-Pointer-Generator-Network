Negligent? Dr George Fielding, the weight loss surgeon who performed Chris Christie's bariatric surgery has been sued by families of patients who have died following his procedure

The doctor who performed Chris Christie's 'lap band' weight loss surgery has been named in a handful of malpractice lawsuits and sued by the families of three patients who died following surgery on his operating table.

According to the New York Post, Dr George Fielding, the chief of NYU Langone's Weight Management Program, has also been sued in Australia, has been named in 12 malpractice suits in New York and is currently involved in a whistleblower case after a former colleague told patients his practice was unsafe.

The New Jersey Governor sought bariatric surgery at NYU after receiving a referral from Jets coach Rex Ryan and claims that he has been feeling in fine since Dr Fielding operated on him in February.

Avoiding the question of whether he knew of the doctor's spotty patient history, he told the Post: 'He appeared from my research to be the foremost expert on it in the country. He told me he's done over 5,000 of the surgeries and he had the surgery himself. He kinda sold me in this respect.'

Dr Fielding, a pioneer of the life-changing obesity procedure who married fellow weight loss surgery superstar Dr Christine Ren, was accused of having an 'entrepreneurial approach' to his work by a coroner who reported on the 2003 death of Shannon Tang, 21.

An investigation found that the surgeon only met the 381lb Singaporean one day before his scheduled procedure and neglected to carry out a preoperative workup or warn his patient of the risks involved.

In the case of Rebecca Quatinetz, 27, from New York, her family recalled that she was in pain for six weeks after her lap band surgery with Dr Fielding before passing away in her Stuyvesant Town apartment in 2009.

A lawyer for the family explained that the band placed at the top of the stomach to restrict food intake had been placed too tightly and was not spotted in either of the six follow-up appointments.

'She was starving,' Karyn Schiller told the Post. 'She couldn't get or keep anything down.'

Eventually she died of a heart condition that had shown up in preoperative tests but of which Ms Quatinetz had not been informed.

'We believe Dr. Fielding did not review the results of his own tests,' Ms Schiller said. 'So Rebecca, who met him once, three days before surgery, did not give informed consent or get treatment that could have saved her life.'

Thinner: The governor did not respond to questions over whether he knew about his doctor's history but said that he had been referred to him and after research concluded that he was the foremost expert in his field

Another lawsuit points the finger at Dr Fielding for the death of Anne Marie Harrington, 45 from Brooklyn. The charges claim the doctor and his NYU team failed to notice an esophageal perforation.

One doctor who became troubled by such cases was Dr Neelu Pal. After Rhonda Freiberg suffered a heart attack 36 hours after her bariatric surgery with Dr Fielding in 2006, Dr Pal began to tell his patients to go elsewhere.

In 2010, court papers revealed that Dr Pal would pose as an operating-room nurse and tell patients that she 'had watched many patients die from the procedure'.

The science: During lap band surgery an incision is made through the belly button and a silicone tube is tied around the top of the stomach to restrict food intake

A review by the State Department of Health following Ms Freiberg's death, found that doctors did not adequately monitor her following her surgery. NYU paid her family a $973,000 malpractice settlement.

Chris Christie underwent lap band surgery with Dr Fielding in February. He told the New York Post that he met twice with the weight loss expert before agreeing to the procedure which has already helped him shed 40lbs.

'I went in at 7 a.m. He met me in the lobby, walked me upstairs, and I had the surgery at 7:30,' said Mr Christie. 'I was out of surgery by 8:10 and home by 5.'
