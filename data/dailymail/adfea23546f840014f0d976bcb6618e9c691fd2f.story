The Goodwood Festival of Speed is a joyous celebration of all things fast and furious.

Yet for one parent yesterday, things were far from fun when their six month-old baby became trapped in their car.

Step forward the 'fourth emergency service,' the AA, who proved to live up to their tagline.

The company are official partners of this year's Festival, and as such offered members of the public free membership for the opening day on Wednesday.

And almost immediately they were forced into action to prevent what could have turned into a precarious situation.

At the Goodwood Hotel, the baby became trapped inside a 2012 Ford C-Max, with the keys in the vehicle. [related]

The
 fire brigade were called by the hotel staff, but people panicked as the
 car was in direct sunlight and temperatures were rising.

But
 AA man Jamie Walls, 38, who has been on patrol since he was 19, was on 
hand to rescue the situation, arriving within minutes and forcing entry 
into the vehicle and handing over the baby to a very emotional parent.

The Festival of Speed is the largest motoring garden party in the world, and was founded in 1993 by Lord March.

Held in the immaculate grounds of Goodwood House, this annual Hillclimb event is a true celebration of motor sport.

This year's theme is ‘Addicted to Winning – The Unbeatable Champions of Motor Sport’, celebrating the legendary drivers and riders, teams and manufacturers, who have swept all before them in their sport.

Visitors can expect to see cars and motorbikes from over 100 years of worldwide motor racing history climb the hill.

The fire brigade arrived shortly after, blue lights flashing, but the situation had been resolved, and their job became to merely sign off what could have become a desperate situation.

The hotel staff were extremely impressed by the AA's rescue mission.

And it will be a feather in the cap for the organisation, with the fourth emergency service beating the third.

The man with the plan Walls said: 'There was a big crowd around the car and it was scorching. I shouted at onlookers to cover the car from the heat and they took a material banner from the hotel and put it over the car.

'I spotted the keys in a big bunch on the front seat. I managed to force in a rod but it was a tricky and delicate move as I had to turn the keys over and then just managed to press the remote with my rods.

'To load cheers the door unlocked and I recovered the baby girl. I had heard sirens in the background but just got on with my job and got the baby out in minutes.

'The crowd just continued to cheer me as the fire engine arrived. They was lots of banter about the fourth emergency service but to me it is just part of my brilliant job.'

Edmund King, AA president, added: 'Yesterday was a momentous day for the AA. We became a Public Company (PLC) for the first time in our 109 history and flagged off that event at the start of the Festival of Speed (see picture).

'But perhaps more importantly our hero patrols continued doing what they are best at in the world – rescuing vulnerable people.

'It was a good job we offered to rescue anyone in need at Goodwood as panic was setting in near the Goodwood hotel when a six-month old baby was locked in her car. A crowd had gathered around the frantic parents as the temperatures rose.

'Our Fourth Emergency Service patrol got there with minutes of being called and before the fire service and managed to use his technical skills whilst watched by a crowd. We are pleased to announce that the baby, parents and patrol are doing just fine.'
