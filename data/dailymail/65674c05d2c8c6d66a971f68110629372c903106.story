Sky watchers around the world enjoyed a treat last night in the form of an astonishing larger-than-average full moon.

The third and final ‘supermoon’ of the summer lit up the sky, with stunning photographs showing the beauty of the rare occurrence.

It happens when a full or new moon coincides with the Moon's closest approach to Earth, known as its perigee - the spot closest on its oval orbit.

The event has occurred two other times this summer, on July 12 and August 10. Approximately every 14th full moon is a supermoon.

Because last night’s moon was also the full moon that falls closest to the autumnal equinox, it was also a Harvest Moon.

The exact supermoon moment happened at 2.38am UK time early this morning. It was the fourth supermoon of this year, with the first on January 1.

But it will be a long time before another similar sight is seen, with the next supermoon not happening until September 28, 2015.
