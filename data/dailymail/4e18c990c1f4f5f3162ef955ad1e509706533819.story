Axed: Columnist Dick Metcalf was canned from Guns & Ammo for promoting gun controls in his December column

The editor of Guns & Ammo magazine apologized to readers and resigned shortly after the writer of a column advocating gun control was fired this week.

Dick Metcalf, a well-known television host and gun writer, was canned after penning a column in favour of gun control in the magazine’s December issue. The outrage then prompted editor Jim Bequette to issue an apology and resign.

In the apology, Mr Bequette said he hoped the column ‘would generate a healthy exchange of ideas on gun rights,’ but then said he was wrong and asked for forgiveness.

Mr Metcalfe, widely visible in the gun community, has written about guns and hosted gun-oriented television shows for decades, but that did not save him from reader backlash.

Especially, as the Washington Times noted, when the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence posted the column to its site saying ; the editor (sic) of Guns & Ammo makes an argument for gun regulation.’

‘I firmly believe that all U.S. citizens have a right to keep and bear arms,’ Mr Metcalf wrote, ‘but I do not believe they have a right to use them irresponsibly.’

The offending column did not say that people should be barred from owning guns. It argued that gun owners should be required to pass a certification similar to owning a car.

Not just a columnist: Mr Metcalf also hosted several television programs produced by the magazine's parent company

‘[Government has] an equal right to enact regulatory laws requiring them to undergo adequate training and preparation for the responsibility of bearing arms,’ Mr Metcalf continued.

Mr Metcalf then cites the example set this month by Illinois, which recently enacted a concealed carry weapons regulation that allows for the issuance of a permit after 16 hours of training are completed, which he argued hardly constitutes infringement.

Reader backlash was fierce, and action was swift.

Writing that he owes every reader an apology, Mr Bequette said the magazine’s ‘commitment to the Second Amendment is unwavering.’

The former editor said Mr Metcalf had been let go and that he made a mistake publishing the column, which he thought would spur healthy debate.

Lock shot: Mr Metcalf's aim is usually dead center, but his last column missed the mark with readers

Calling the decision a ‘miscalculation,’ Mr Bequette also announced that plans in place for a new editor to assume control of the magazine in January would be implemented immediately.

The pro-gun control column has been removed from the magazine’s site, but is archived on various other webpages.

Comments to the apology were mostly negative, with many people saying they had cancelled their subscriptions.

Some defended publishing the column, but were shouted down by several antagonistic comments.
