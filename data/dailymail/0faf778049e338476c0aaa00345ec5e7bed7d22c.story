Dallas Mavericks 
owner Mark Cuban apologized Thursday to Trayvon Martin's family over his
 choice of words in a videotaped interview in which he addressed bigotry
 and prejudice.

Cuban even 
revealed some of his own prejudices in the interview with Inc. magazine,
 and said he believes everyone has 'prejudices and bigotries' on some 
level.

But after his words
 - which came with the NBA still dealing with the fallout over racist 
remarks made by now-banned Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling - 
created a stir in social media and other circles, Cuban took to Twitter 
to offer his apology.

Remarks: Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has said he would cross the street if he saw 'a black kid in a hoodie' or 'a guy that has tattoos all over his face' while he spoke in an interview, pictured

'In hindsight I should have 
used different examples,' Cuban wrote. 'I didn't consider the Trayvon 
Martin family, and I apologize to them for that.'

'Beyond apologizing to the Martin family, I stand by the words and the substance of the interview,' Cuban wrote.

Martin
 was the black Florida teen who was shot and killed by neighborhood 
watch volunteer George Zimmerman in February 2012. Martin was wearing a 
hooded sweatshirt - commonly called a 'hoodie' - that night, and that 
particular piece of clothing became a rallying cry for those who 
demanded justice.

Zimmerman was eventually acquitted.

Earlier
 in the day, billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban faced huge 
criticism after admitting that he would cross the street if he saw 'a 
black kid in a hoodie'.

Cuban
 made the remarks as he spoke about bigotry after he was asked at a 
business conference to address the controversy over banned Los Angeles 
Clippers owner Donald Sterling.

Division: Trayvon Martin was killed on February 
26, 2012, as he passed through the gated, Sanford, Florida, community 
where George Zimmerman lived and served as a watch volunteer

In the interview, which was shown
 on Wednesday at the GrowCo convention hosted by Inc magazine, he said 
that overcoming bigotry requires acknowledging internal prejudices.

'I know I'm prejudiced and I know I'm bigoted in a lot of different ways,' he said.

'If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it's late at night, I'm walking to the other side of the street. 
And if on that side of the street, thereâ€™s a guy that has tattoos all 
over his face - white guy, bald head, tattoos everywhere - I'm walking 
back to the other side of the street.'

'The list goes on - of stereotypes that we all live up to and that we're fearful of,' he continued.

'I
 know that I'm not perfect. While we all have our prejudices and 
bigotries, we have to learn that it's an issue that we have to control, 
that it's part of my responsibility as an entrepreneur to try to solve 
it, not just to kick the problem down the road.'

After the interview was shared online, Cuban was lambasted for his comments.

Accusations: After reports of the interview emerged, some Twitter users branded Cuban 'racist'

Response: Cuban tweeted back to his critics, saying that he was simply being honest about his failings

Backup: Other Twitter users jumped to Cuban's defense, saying he was simply stating the way things are

Critics 
said his 'hoodie' reference recalled the 2012 shooting of unarmed, black
 Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, who was wearing a hooded sweatshirt 
when he was fatally wounded in a struggle with a man who said he feared 
for his life.

Cuban defended his views on Twitter, saying that his quotes were not meant to advocate racism.

'The point was that before we can help others deal w racism we have to be honest about ourselves,' Cuban wrote in a tweet.

'You're
 trying to make this about a Hoodie,' he said to another tweeter. 'You 
know damn well its not [sic]. It's about whatever makes you feel 
threatened.'

Fellow
 NBA owner Sterling was banned for life from the sport and fined $2.5 
million after a recording of him surfaced where he made comments about 
race that included telling his girlfriend not to bring black people to 
his team's games.

Last month, Cuban, who is worth $2.6 billion, condemned his comments as 'abhorrent' and 'obviously racist', the New York Daily News reported.

daughter Alexis and wife Tiffany, and right celebrating a Mavericks win 
with daughters Alexis (left) and Alyssa, has owned the team since 2000

Opinion: He made the comments while talking about bigotry after he was asked about Donald Sterling, who could be forced to give up the LA Clippers after he was recorded making racist remarks

But
 he initially opposed calls to ban him from the NBA, saying it would be a
 'very slippery slope' if the league forced an owner to sell the team.

'In
 no uncertain terms am I supporting what Donald Sterling said, or his 
position,' Cuban said. 'He's obviously racist, he's obviously bigoted. 
And in this day and age when you're in the public eye you've got to be 
damn careful - if that's your position and that's unfortunately where 
you're at - you better be damn careful what you say, even in the privacy
 of your own home.

'But
 regardless of your background, regardless of the history they have, if 
we're taking something somebody said in their home and we're trying to 
turn it into something that leads to you being forced to divest property
 in any way, shape or form, that's not the United States of America. I 
don't want to be part of that.'
