Two new parents' world was shattered when their baby was born 16 weeks prematurely and given just a 10 per cent chance of survival.

Brooke and Shaun Simons’ son Jack was born at just 24 weeks, weighing 1lb 9oz.

The distraught mother and father were told that if their son survived, it was likely he would suffer long-term health complications.

It took four and half weeks for Jack to come off his ventilator: only then could his parents finally hold him

A year on, and Jack is a happy, healthy baby, but reaching his first birthday was to be the toughest struggle of all of their lives.

‘Pushing out a baby that you are not ready to have is the hardest thing I have ever had to do’ explains Mrs Simons.

‘The excruciating pain a mother experiences when they are in labour is made bearable by the excitement of finally meeting their baby for the first time. I was going through it but with a 90 per cent risk of seeing a lifeless body. 

‘I did not understand how our entire lives were about to change in a way we never though possible.’

Mrs Simons had some twinges throughout her pregnancy, which she presumed quite normal.

But when, at 23 and half weeks pregnant, she suffered severe back pain and felt unwell, she went to see her doctor.

Any skin to skin contact is beneficial for preterm babies as it helps regulate their temperature and helps fight infection

Mr and Mrs Simons put their son's survival down to the amazing team at Luton and Dunstable hospital's NICU where he stayed for over 4 months

After examining her, he informed her she was actually two to three cm dilated. She was in labour.

‘I was rushed to Luton and Dunstable hospital where I was given two steroid injections which would help the baby have any chance of using its lungs so early.

‘The anxiety in both our bodies – my husband and I – was palpable and the fear of the unknown was too frightening to comprehend.

‘After four days of efforts to keep the baby inside, I went into full labour lasting 19 hours. No one could tell us why this was actually happening.

‘Jack was whisked away to be stabilised minutes after he was born. We managed to have a peek at him through the tears and heartbreak, but weren’t allowed to hold him.

‘Standing at Jack’s side, in his incubator, a doctor told us he was “doing satisfactorily”. My husband asked if that was good. The doctor replied with “It’s satisfactory, and that’s the best I can give you.”’

It took four and half weeks for Jack to build up the strength to come off his ventilator; only then could his parents hold him for the first time.

It was at this point that Mrs Simons says she finally felt like a mother.

She said: ‘It was the most perfect moment of my life. He was just 2lb, and it was like holding a small furry Guinea pig.

During his four and half months on the NICU, he suffered from chronic lung disease, an open duct in his heart (PDA), hyperglycaemia and septicaemia, among other traumas.

Jack under went numerous ultrasounds and X-rays, 10 blood transfusions, chemical injections into his eyes and many courses of antibiotics

‘This cuddle wasn’t just for us, it was for him too. Skin to skin, or "kangaroo" care, is beneficial for preterm babies as it helps regulate their temperature and helps fight infection.

‘We learnt a lot at our time on the NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit). It’s like entering a world we never knew existed.

‘The noise of a million machines beeping and buzzing, medical words and abbreviations flying out of doctors' and nurses' mouths, but hardly any noise from the actual babies. They couldn’t physically cry.'

Mr and Mrs Simons put their son’s survival down to the amazing team at Luton and Dunstable hospital’s NICU. The doctors and nurses worked around the clock to make sure Jack was taken care of.

During his four and half months on the NICU, Jack suffered from chronic lung disease, an open duct in his heart (PDA), hyperglycaemia and septicaemia, among other traumas.

Even as he grew stronger Jack had to remain on nasal oxygen to help his undeveloped lungs

On the 11th February, three weeks after his due date, Jack was able to return home

He had numerous ultrasounds and X-rays, 10 blood transfusions, chemical injections into his eyes and many courses of antibiotics.

‘Those four months were full of ups and downs. If Jack was having a good day, so did we. If he had a bad day, it was even worse for us.

‘We always remained positive though. And with all our friends and family around us, praying for Jack, we managed to stay strong.

‘On the 11th February, three weeks after his due date, our baby came home with us. He was still on nasal oxygen for a further 12 weeks.

‘Today we have a very happy and healthy beautiful boy who is hitting all his milestones.

‘He is now on the move and there is no stopping him!

The family say: 'We owe everything to Luton and Dunstable hospital. They without doubt saved Jack's life'

Within hours of setting up a Just Giving account in Jack's name, over £8,000 had been raised for the hospital

‘We owe everything to Luton and Dunstable hospital. They without doubt saved Jack’s life.’

After Jack was allowed home, Mr and Mrs Simons set up a Justgiving.com charity link and within 24 hours they had raised over £8,000 for the hospital.

Today, the total stands at £19,655. The money will be used to develop and grow the NICU to be able to accommodate more parents in their position.

‘We were so lucky the space was available for us. Had it not been, our story might have had a very different ending.’

‘It is World Prematurity Day on November 17th, and we wanted to bring our story to the attention of parents that might be going through the same thing as we did.

‘You must stay positive. There are so many amazing doctors, nurses and incredible medicines to help premature babies. There IS hope,’ they say.
