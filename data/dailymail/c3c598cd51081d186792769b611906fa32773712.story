A New Mexico woman will reunite with her Costa Rican family Thursday almost 40 years after she said her father took her away from her mother.

Naomi Martinez, 45, of Albuquerque, N.M., said she spent most of her life thinking her mother, brother and sisters abandoned her until she was contacted by her estranged family online.

'I grew up thinking they didn't want me and that they abandoned me,' Martinez told MailOnline.

Heartbroken: Naomi Martinez said her father, Curtis Dilas, left, took her from her mother, Erlinda Compos Carrillo, right, when she was around five years old and brought her to the U.S. for medical attention

Memories: Naomi Martinez will see her mother and sister again Thursday

She said her father, Curtis Dilas, brought her to New Mexico when she was about five to get medical attention for a burn. Martinez now thinks her father only used the burn, which she sustained from an oven at three-years-old, as an excuse to take her away from her mother, brother and sisters in Costa Rica.

'My father had to have a signed affidavit from a lawyer that allowed him to take me out,' she told KRQE. 'The way he got around that was he told my mother, "I'm going to take her to the United States to get her treated by a doctor up there."'

She told MailOnline her father would taunt her with the affidavit, which her mother had to sign, using it as proof that her mother didn't want her—which she now knows wasn't the case.

'She did it because she thought she was helping me,' Martinez said.

Reunited: Naomi Martinez' father made her believe that her mother, Erlinda Compos Carrillo, seen here with Martinez before she was brought to the U.S., had abandoned her

'I thought she abandoned me and didn't want me and was glad to have me out of her life,' Martinez told KRQE.

Martinez it was difficult growing up without a mother.

'I would look for women to take the place to be a mother figure when I was little,' she said.

But Martinez acknowledged it was difficult for her mother and family in Costa Rica, too.

'I feel so bad. It really gets me emotional thinking about how much she would have gone through,' Martinez said. 'I look at my own daughter and I couldnt imagine going through my life and not watching her grow up.'

Connection: After Naomi Martinez got a Facebook profile, her estranged family contacted her

Martinez joined Facebook in 2011 and a few months after joining, her oldest sister sent her a couple of messages. She said a friend she met volunteering at a local cultural center found out about Martinez' family history and reached out to her sister in Costa Rica, prompting the exchange.

At first, Martinez was hesitant to respond.

'I kind of had my life already made,' she said. 'I didn't know if I wanted to open that up.'

Martinez responded after her sister's third message and discovered her family didn't abandon her but has been trying to find her for decades.

'The first time that I heard my mother's voice was something really emotional for me because she told me, "I still see you as a little girl,"' Martinez told KRQE.

Estranged: Naomi Martinez said she hasn't spoken with her father, Curtis Dilas, right, in many years

Martinez will pick up her mother and one of her sisters from the airport in Albuquerque Thursday. They will stay with her through July.

'It's been a whole roller coaster of emotions,' Martinez said. 'Anxiety, nervousness and anticipation.'

Martinez now has four daughters of her own and is married. She told MailOnline she's having a joint celebration for her daughter's 18th birthday and her mother's 80th birthday, which is coming up next month.

She said she hasn't spoken to her father for at least 10 years, but that she doesn't have any animosity toward him.

'I don't think he did it completely out of malice,' she said. 'For the most part I think he did it because he thought he was doing the right thing.'

Martinez said she would be open to reconnecting with her father, too.
