A 21-year-old Australian man is trapped overseas after an accident landed him in hospital, unable to fly home because his insurance policy was voided when the company discovered he had been drinking before the incident.

Jordan Darney, from Marcoola on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, returned to his hotel room with after a night out with friends in Prague, when he stepped out of a window to smoke a cigarette and fell three storeys to the ground.

Jordan suffered a broken pelvis, two broken elbows, facial lacerations and bruising, and woke with little memory of the accident but with a recorded blood alcohol level of .114%.

His family claim that his travel insurance company, Southern Cross Travel Insurance, refused to pay for medical treatment when they found out the reading, leaving Jordan stranded in a foreign country and without aid.

His mother Sue flew out on the first available flight when her son called her and her husband Craig to tell them what had happened.

'Jordan rang from hospital and Sue answered and asked, 'Is dad there with you?' Craig told Daily Mail Australia.

'He told us both to sit down in a really low, horrible voice. I was assuming the worst, but then I realised that if he was ringing then he must be alright,' he said.

'After we got off the phone we broke down and tried to console each other and then it was a mad thing of 'what do we do, ring the insurance company, get some flights.'

Jordan had been prepped for surgery when he was informed that his insurance company was refusing to pay the medical bills because he had been drinking. 

'Sue had to max out her credit cards to get him the surgery, and since then it's cost us $6,000 a week just for him to stay in hospital,' said Craig.

'He's going to be there for at least another six or seven weeks, and I'm not sure where we're going to get the money from.'

'Money doesn't mean anything to me. If I have to live in a hut for the rest of my life, I don't care. That's why you have kids. I just want Jordan home.'  

In order to get Jordan home, his family need to raise the $60,000 needed to pay for a specialised medical team to assist him on a flight home. As a result of his injuries, Jordan is unable to sit up for take off or landing, and so will need to lie on a stretcher throughout the flight.

Desperate to get his son home, Craig is attempting to release his superannuation early. In order to do this, he has to prove that he is experiencing significant hardship, which means getting staff from the hospital in Prague to sign a form attesting to Jordan's condition.

The form needs to be translated, which is more money, before it can be looked at by the staff- and in the meantime Jordan is languishing in the hospital with only his mum by his side. 

'It's like drawing blood,' Craig said.

'I know there are processes and I understand that, but it takes time and we don't have time.' 

'When he went in for the operation I said to Sue that I wished it was me, and not him. I don't think there's anything wrong with the hospital, but who wants their son half a world away?'

Craig is juggling running the Surf Club apartments which he and his wife manage with supporting his family long distance and frantically trying to raise the money they need to come home.

'I know there will be some people out there saying, what a drop kick, he was drunk, but he'd blown the equivalent of three glasses of wine.'

'The thing I keep saying is that it could be anyone's kid, which is scary'.

Local Hannah Chapman, who knows the family well and started the fundraising page for Jordan, said that she couldn't believe that the policy was void simply because he'd had a few drinks.

'Jordan is such a vivacious and bubbly person, a really out there character,' said local Hannah Chapman

'Everyone in the town knows him, he's been the local barista since he was 15, has made everyone their coffee,' Hannah said

'I did the whole Europe thing, I did so many stupid things, and I had no idea that if something had happened to me I would have been in the same situation.

'This could happen to anyone. How many people travel and think they'll be covered, and how many parents aren't aware that their children might not have access to the medical help they need?' 

'The family has already spent more than $20,000, where are they meant to get the rest?' 

Southern Cross Travel Insurance have been contacted for confirmation of their policy details, something which Craig has quizzed them on.

'I posed a hypothetical question to them, and asked that if I was overseas and shared a bottle of wine with my wife, and looked one way before crossing but forgot to look the other, and was hit by a car, would I be covered?' he said.

'They couldn't answer me. But that's the same level alcohol as Jordan. I just don't know what the world is coming to.'

The Darney's are hoping to raise the funds they need to bring Jordan home through the their crowdfunding page.

'The response has been amazing, and everyone has been so supportive,' said Hannah. 

'I think it's because Jordan is such a vivacious and bubbly person, a really out there character.'

'Everyone in the town knows him, he's been the local barista since he was 15, has made everyone their coffee,' Hannah said.

'He's very well loved in our tight-knit community. We just want him home for Christmas.'
