Some special youngsters had the time of their lives this week as they enjoyed a Christmas day out with British Airways and Disneyland Paris.

This year's X Factor finalists Only the Young joined former finalist Stacey Soloman, TV personality Sam Faiers, Mark Feehily from Westlife and television presenter Rylan Clark on board a special charter flight from London City Airport.

Together, they accompanied 40 children, young people and their escorts from several charities for a fun-filled day out.

The children and their celebrity escorts arrived at the airport in the early morning hours – or what Rylan Clark referred to as 'ridiculous o'clock' – on Tuesday, December 16. 

The trip was part of British Airways' celebrations for reaching £9 million in funds for Flying Start, it's global charity partnership with Comic Relief.

These particular charities - and the individual children - were nominated because of the kids' incredible achievements and acts of kindness.

The party started bright and early with Clark himself acting as flight attendant, serving breakfast to those on board.

As the sun came up over Paris, the flight full of excited kids and reality TV show finalists even broke into song – performing an impromptu rendition of Let It Go.

And the fun continued once they arrived at Disneyland.

Together, the group hit the rides, watched the Christmas parade and posed for photographs alongside a Christmas outfit-clad Mickey and Minnie Mouse.

'It's really nice coming with the kids,' X Factor stars Only the Young said. 

'We've had the plane journey with them as well, so we kind of got to know them before we got here.'

'Bringing all the children from charities makes it just so, so special for me,' Stacey Solomon, singer and TV personality, added. 

'It's an absolute honour and a pleasure to be with these children. 

'They're unbelievable and have the most amazing spirits.'

Disney and British Airways have long been involved with granting wishes and making deserving children's dreams come true.

Last year alone, Disneyland Paris hosted 65 on-site day events and granted 740 wishes along with European organisations and charities.

Mary Berry, British Airways' community investment manager, said: 'This is the second year we have teamed up with Disneyland Paris to give these deserving children and young people a Christmas to remember forever.

'We are so grateful to them and all the celebrities for giving their time to make this such a special, star-studded day out.'
