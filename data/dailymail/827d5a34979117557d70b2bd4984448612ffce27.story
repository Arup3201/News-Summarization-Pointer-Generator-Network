Didier Drogba has now scored in 12 successive Champions League campaigns. However, he is not the record holder for scoring in consecutive seasons of the competition. 

Real Madrid legend Raul holds that accolade, after netting in 14 straight campaigns. 

A special mention must go to Ryan Giggs, who scored in 11 straight seasons of Europe’s elite club competition.

Didier Drogba has now scored in 12 successive Champions League campaigns after netting against Maribor

Raul holds the record on 14 campaigns whilst Drogba leapfrogged Ryan Giggs who managed 11 seasons

England boss Roy Hodgson was at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night, and while only one Englishman, John Terry, started the match, three of Maribor’s starting XI were included in the Slovenia squad for qualification matches against Switzerland and Lithuania earlier this month. 

The players under the spotlight were left back Mitja Viler (who scored his side’s own goal) and central midfielders Ales Mertelj and Zeljko Filipovic.

The last time Terry and Drogba scored in the same match for Chelsea was back in March 14 2012, during the 4-1 Champions League win over Napoli.

Chelsea went on to win the competition that year, so Blues fans might consider that a good omen. 

What are the chances of Terry and Drogba replicating the feat this season?

He may be only 31, but Tuesday night’s referee had no problem in controlling his first-ever Champions League clash.
