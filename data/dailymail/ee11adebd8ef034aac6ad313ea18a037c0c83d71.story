The Wimbledon women’s draw was blown wide open when top-seed Serena Williams was dramatically bundled out by the unheralded Alize Cornet of France.

The world No 1 crumbled after a dominant start in a rain-delayed third-round clash to lose 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 in 124 minutes against the 24-year-old from Nice, who has never made the last 16 of these championships.

Sealed with a kiss: Alize Cornet celebrates stunning victory against Serena Williams

The world No 24 continually wrongfooted the sluggish American in the chill evening air out on Court No 1 following the first prolonged rain interruptions of the tournament.

A dazed Cornet tried to address her amazing accomplishment soon after winning and declared: ‘I just cannot believe it.

‘A few years ago I couldn’t even play on grass, I was so bad. And she’s at home here, she plays so good here. Wow, it’s just a dream. I tried to fight on every point. I don’t know how I did it, just with heart.

‘She played very well, but I tried to focus and make sure I had nothing to regret.

‘She helped me a bit because she made two big mistakes, she is human like everyone else and that’s what I was thinking about.

‘This is the biggest upset of the tournament because she is number one and has won so many titles at Wimbledon.

‘I cannot believe that it was me who did it, I’m going to have to celebrate with my team.’Williams has won 17 Grand Slam titles but her inconsistency in the Slams  is becoming something of a problem.

This is the fourth time in the last five that she has been knocked out in the fourth round or earlier, and the latest upset comes barely three weeks after she was defeated in the second round of the French Open.
