Amazon has teamed up with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering packages on Sunday across select parts of America.

The scheme is launching initially in Los Angeles and New York before being rolled out to other states next year.

Reports also claim the service is set to launch in London ‘later this month’ but no further information about the full UK rollout schedule has been announced.

The Sunday delivery service will launch initially in Los Angeles and New York before coming to London 'later this month.' The American-based service will be run through the U.S. Postal Service, while the London option will use Amazon's own delivery trucks

Amazon's Sunday delivery option, in conjunction with the U.S Postal Service, will launch initially in Los Angeles and New York.

It is set to be available in London, using Amazon's own trucks 'later this month.'

Eligible customers in the U.S. will 
begin seeing the Sunday delivery promise at the checkout after they add 
items to their cart.

Prime members will be given Sunday delivery for free.

Other customers will need to pay a premium, although exact costs have not been confirmed.

Dave Clark, 
Amazon’s vice president of worldwide operations and customer service said: 
‘You can order a backpack for your child
on Friday and be packing it for them Sunday night.

‘We’re excited that now every day is an Amazon delivery day and we know our Prime members, who voraciously shop on Amazon, will love the additional convenience they will experience as part of this new service.’

An official statement suggested the Sunday service would only be available to Amazon Prime members.

However, the firm later told MailOnline 
it would be open to all Amazon customers.

Amazon Prime costs £49 a year in the 
UK for unlimited, free two-day shipping on millions of items plus over 
350,000 free Kindle titles.

In the U.S. Prime members pay $79 a year and additionally get unlimited streaming of select TV shows and movies.

Prime members will get Sunday deliveries for free while non-Prime members will be expected to pay a premium to guarantee delivery on the weekend. The pricing of this added delivery cost has not yet been confirmed.

The statement only detailed information about the U.S. service, yet Clark told The Wall Street Journal the service would also launch in the UK by the end of November.

Amazon Prime customers who pay £49 a year, or $79 a year in the U.S, will get the Sunday service for free as a delivery option at the checkout. Other customers will pay a premium although costs have not been confirmed

Although the American offering will be run through the U.S Postal Service, Clark said UK packages will be delivered on a Sunday using Amazon’s own trucks.

Amazon plans to extend the service to other parts of the U.S, including Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix, next year but did not say if the UK offering would be extended outside of London.

Eligible Prime customers in the U.S. will begin seeing the Sunday delivery promise at the checkout after they add items to their cart.

Amazon is expected to announce more UK information when the service officially launches in London.

The news comes after rival eBay recently bought express delivery service Shutl.

Shutl specialises in delivering online goods within an hour - although the firm's record is 14 minutes.

Ebay has not announced when it will start offering the superfast delivery option, but has said it will be launched in London before being rolled out nationwide.
