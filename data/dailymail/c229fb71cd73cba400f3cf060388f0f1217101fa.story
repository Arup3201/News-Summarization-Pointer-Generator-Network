Blondes have long been the butt of jokes for their supposed lack of intelligence.

But those with a fair head of hair can now take heart - for scientists have disproved the dumb blonde stereotype.

New research has revealed that hair colour is ‘only skin deep’ because it depends on just a single letter of the genetic code.

Not so dumb: The study proves hair colour is completely unrelated to any other trait and dispels the shallow claim that blonde hair signifies lower intelligence

Switching a single ‘letter’ of DNA would turn brunettes to blondes, according to academics from Stanford University in California - and would have no affect on the brain.

The study proves hair colour is completely unrelated to any other trait and dispels the shallow claim that blonde hair signifies lower intelligence.

Lead researcher Professor David Kingsley said: ‘The genetic mechanism that controls blond hair doesn’t alter the biology of any other part of the body.

‘It’s a good example of a trait that’s skin deep - and only skin deep.’

Researchers also found that the gene that affects blonde hair isn’t associated with eye colour - suggesting that blonde hair and blue eyes are not genetically linked.

Experiments with mice showed that the ‘blonde’ switch caused animals to be born with light, golden-brown fur.

The switch alters activity of a gene called Kit ligand that was already known to be associated with hair colour.

Compared with its ‘brunette’ version, which has a different DNA letter, it reduced Kit ligand activity by about 20 per cent.

Dr Kingsley, whose research appears in the journal Nature Genetics, said:‘This is a good example of how fine-tuned regulatory differences may be to produce different traits.’

Many other regulatory elements may be scattered throughout the DNA that surrounds the Kit ligand gene, he added.

The gene not only aids the development of pigment-producing cells, but has a host of other roles around the body.

It influences the behaviour of blood stem cells, sperm or egg precursors, and gut neurons.
