Struggling Efe Ambrose ended a thoroughly miserable week with one tiny sliver of good news as referee Antti Munnukka indicated that he would not officially record the Celtic defender’s red card against Tottenham Hotspur, thereby sparing him a suspension from Celtic’s first Premiership match of the season against St Johnstone.

That said, on current form, manager Ronny Deila might not be inclined to select the Nigerian defender anyway.

Ambrose was sent off for the second time in four days as a shadow Celtic side took a heavy beating from Spurs in Helsinki, the Nigerian’s bad luck lingering on since his part in the team’s Champions League drubbing in Warsaw last midweek.

Ambrose’s ordering off against Legia gave the Poles a platform on which to build their 4-1 first leg victory and, despite performing reasonably well for much of this match, he conceded the free-kick from which Christian Eriksen scored Spurs’ fifth, conceded the penalty which made it 6-1 and was then sent packing for a foul on Emmanuel Adebayor.

Assistant boss John Collins, in charge as Ronny Deila drilled his players for the second leg against Legia back in Glasgow, remarked: ‘I thought Efe was playing really well – it was a harsh sending off. I’m not going to talk about the referee but if he’s not including it in his report, that’s good news. That’s a relief for Efe and for us.’

While he may have dodged a bullet domestically – team-mate Charlie Mulgrew missed the SPL opener in 2012 after referee Bas Nijhuis reported his red in a friendly against Ajax to the Dutch FA – Ambrose will be missing as Deila’s team attempt to recover from the 4-1 defeat suffered in Poland last midweek.

In terms of preparing for that recovery mission at Murrayfield, Celtic needed this fixture like a hole in the head.

The club may have banked a cheque for turning up but the no show of Deila and key men like England internationalist Fraser Forster, Kris Commons and Virgil van Dijk would have left the organisers and much of the 14,000 crowd in the Olympic Stadium feeling short-changed.

On the ball: Kyle Naughton (centre) started for Tottenham in their pre-season win against Celtic

Collins fielded what was essentially a development side with eight players aged 21 and under in the line-up and new Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino admitted he expected more from Celtic: ‘I was hoping for a stronger test.

'We brought a strong squad but it was still a worthwhile game. It wasn’t a waste of time, sometimes these games are more difficult because young players try harder in friendlies.’

Collins countered by defending Celtic’s team selection: ‘The bottom line is the game was arranged in February before we arrived. It’s fallen between big European games so circumstances dictate we come out here with a really young team.

‘For our team full of under-18s, it’s a massive step up for them from the Scottish youth league but they’ll remember it, they’ll watch these players on TV and be able to say they played against them.

‘Obviously it’s painful but I thought there were patches in the first half where we passed it and were brave on the ball. Liam Henderson in particular had a terrific game in there against quality players.’

The margin of defeat may have been greater but there was less shame in this team of kids going down by a 6-1 scoreline than in the heavy beating endured by their senior counterparts in Poland last midweek.

Only Ambrose and local hero Teemu Pukki survived from Celtic’s wipe-out in Warsaw and while the former’s inclusion was a penance, the latter was handed the captain’s armband for his homecoming.

Pukki scored for Finland against the Czech Republic on his last appearance at the grand old venue that was constructed for the 1952 Olympics and admitted he was more than happy to make the journey.

‘I really wanted to be here. To play in the Olympic Stadium again was a nice thing to do. It is a big thing to be the captain of a team like Celtic but I think it will be the last time. If you lose 6-1 that is not great.

‘Wednesday will be hard but the whole team believes. We want to do it and we hope we can do it.’

Getting stuck in: Kane (centre) gets tackled by Jamie Lindsay (right) during the Helsinki-based friendly

Pochettino is getting to know his own players but possesses a strong pool that made practice inevitable for goalkeeper Craig Gordon, starting his third Saturday friendly in a row as he continues to ease himself towards match fitness.

The former Hearts man was soundly beaten after five minutes when Harry Kane slammed home Andros Townsend’s cut-back for the first goal and was again let down by his defence when Roberto Soldado scored the second on the rebound after he’d made the initial save.

Jamie Lindsay claimed one back for Celtic as his header from Dylan McGeouch’s cross crept over the line but an agitated Spurs responded swiftly as Lewis Holtby restored the two-goal gap on the stroke of half-time.

Maestro: Christian Eriksen came on as a second-half for Tottenham and scored a delightful free-kick

Spurs substitute Eric Lamela added the fourth via a deflection off Eoghan O’Connell. Eriksen’s free-kick, a whipped 20-yard effort that left Gordon flailing at fresh air, was the pick of the bunch and although the decision to punish Ambrose seemed harsh as Danny Rose stumbled near the byline there was no denying the conviction of Emmanuel Adebayor’s spot-kick as it rattled in off the post to complete the scoring.

Pukki expressed sympathy with Ambrose after Munukka produced the second yellow following a tussle with Adebayor. ‘I feel for Efe. I think it was a stupid decision from the referee. Why would he give a card in a friendly?’

Everone in attendance might equally have queried just why Celtic were here at all.
