Paula Broadwell, the one-time mistress of CIA Director David Petraeus, has had her scheduled promotion revoked by the Army according to a Defense Department official.

Broadwell, a major in the Army reserves, had been approved for promotion to lieutenant colonel, but that was prior to last November's revelations that she and Petraeus had been conducting an illicit affair.

In the wake of the scandal, Broadwell is under investigation by the Army for having classified information in her home without permission.

Sex scandal: Paula Broadwell has had her promotion revoked by the Army following her affair with ex-CIA director General David Petraeus

Her promotion was initially approved in August, but under Army regulations ‘if new information comes to light’ within six months of a promotion date it can make the person ineligible.

Broadwell has been deemed ineligible because she remains under investigation for a matter that could result in her being punished by the Army, an unnamed Defense Department official told CNN.

Her promotion is revoked until the matter is resolved, but she would become eligible again should she be cleared of any wrong doing, the official said.

Broadwell’s security clearance, which was suspended last year, has not yet been reinstated.

Petraeus had an affair with Broadwell, principal author of his biography 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus' from late 2011 until the Summer of 2012 when he apparently ended the relationship.

Their affair was exposed after Broadwell sent a series of messages to Florida socialite Jill Kelly, apparently warning her off her lover.

The messages, which have been described as 'kind of cat-fight stuff', had been sent anonymously to an account shared by Mrs Kelley and her husband, but FBI investigators traced them to Broadwell.

In one of the emails from Broadwell to Kelley, she accused the Florida housewife of touching 'him' underneath a table and another email asked if Kelley's husband was aware of her actions.

In another, the biographer was apparently aggressive towards Kelley, saying: 'Who do you think you are?'

She also accused the socialite, a Petraeus family friend, of 'parad[ing] around the base', adding: 'You need to take it down a notch.'

Although the sending of the emails was deemed to be insufficient grounds for a criminal charge, the FBI called Broadwell in for questioning, at which time she admitted to the affair with Petraeus.

After Broadwell turned over her computer, classified documents were found, which led to further FBI scrutiny of her relationship with Petraeus.

Although Petraeus was not identified 
as the provider of the documents, the affair was revealed in early 
November 2012 and was cited by Petraeus as the reason for his 
resignation on November 9.

The sex scandal has proved an 
extremely embarrassing episode for the Army and inadvertently lead to 
the resignation of two army generals.

Petraeus resigned after the scandal 
broke and Marine General John Allen announced last week that he is 
retiring to care for his seriously-ill wife, meaning President Obama will drop Allen's nomination to lead U.S. and NATO forces in Europe.

Allen got swept up in the Petraeus 
scandal and was accused of sending thousands of 'flirty' and 
'inappropriate' emails to Kelley.

General Allen has said he is stepping down to care for his wife Kathy, left, who suffers from a series chronic health issues including an autoimmune disorder

He was later cleared of any 
wrongdoing and has denied his stepping down is related to his part in 
the massive military scandal which led to the resignation of Petraeus.

Instead Allen, the longest-serving leader of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, has said he wishes to retire to take care of his wife Kathy, who suffers from a number of chronic health issues including an autoimmune disorder.

'For
more than 35 years, my beloved Kathy has devotedly stood beside me and 
enabled me to serve my country,' Allen said in a statement released last
Tuesday.

Allen had admitted that the investigation took a toll on his wife and mother of their two daughters.
