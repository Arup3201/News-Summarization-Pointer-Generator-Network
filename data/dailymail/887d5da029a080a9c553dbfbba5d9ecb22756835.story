Police said MacKinnon went over to a large holy water bath and start washing himself in it, according to CBC News.

Shortly afterwards, the couple left the church, but returned a short while later when the man was shirtless.

The suspect then attempted to light the altar on fire by taking a glass of wine that was sitting beside a chalice, pouring it over a piece of cloth and using a lighter to try to light it.

Breaking bad: The suspect knocked several religious items over and threw holy bread on the floor

However, the wine kept the cloth from igniting.

In the chaos that ensued, the suspect knocked several religious items over, threw holy bread on the floor and stole a rosary before he was escorted out of the church by a member who called the police.

Police said that when officers arrived they found the shirtless man lying on the grass outside, wearing a rosary ‘in an intoxicated state.’

Now, MacKinnon is facing several charges for his drunken rampage, including arson.

He was arrested and charged with mischief under $5,000, arson and damage to property, two counts of failing to comply with his probation, theft under $5,000 and possession under $5,000.'
