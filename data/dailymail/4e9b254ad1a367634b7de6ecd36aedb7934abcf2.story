A couple paid £38,000-a-year in benefits because they have 11 children have posted a baby scan picture on Facebook - suggesting they may be expecting again.

Cheryl Prudham, 32, had twins last autumn but she may have become pregnant just a month-or-so after giving birth.

This week she posted a picture of a 12-week baby scan for her friends and family to see with the caption: 'Prudham baby #12' - whose birth could earn them an extra £700-a-year in benefits.

Controversial: The Prudhams, from north Kent, take home around £38,000-a-year in benefits, pictured together before the birth of their twins in October

Support: A friend of Cheryl Prudham's appeared to congratulate her in October on her latest pregnancy 

The couple get £12,000 more than the £26,000-a-year cap on benefits by working 20 hours  a week each as carers for the elderly, which allows them to top up their income with tax credits.

The mother-of-11 first attracted criticism after demanding her local council provide her with a bigger council house to give her growing family more space.

And as their family grew Mrs Prudham said publicly their benefits allowed to them to set aside thousands for foreign holidays and presents for their children.

A friend of the Prudhams, who live in Gravesend, Kent told The Sun: 'There could only have been about a month after she had the twins before she was pregnant again.

'I don't know if they'll ever stop. They just keep on having more and more'. 

A spokesman for the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'It's not for the state to say how many children anyone should have, but there is a limit to the number of children taxpayers can support.

'Couples up and down the country face tough decisions all the time when they decide if they can afford another child, and those on benefits should be no different.'

Time away: Mrs Prudham has previously attracted controversy for insisting it was right that taxpayers paid for their two-week holiday in Menorca, which she insisted they 'deserved'

Home: The family live live in this five-bedroom council house in Gravesend, which they have recently redecorated

Mrs Prudham has since removed the scan after claiming it was a joke, and refused to comment on the story today when she answered the door at her semi-detached 1930s house in Gravesend, Kent.

But neighbours were shocked she may be pregnant again. 

One said: 'It is disgusting. What sort of an example is she setting for her other kids? She is taking the mick and telling them it is okay to live off the government and not work hard for your money. 

'Her money should be stopped, but if it is then it is the kids that will suffer. I feel sorry for them the most, because of their parents, they could lose out on things. 

Another resident added: 'They're a joke, the whole family.But surely the government is to blame too? The woman is only in her 30's, who knows how many more kids she could have.'

One neighbour said: 'I feel embarrassed that I live on the same street as them.' 

Earlier this year the family boasted about having £4,000 to splash on Christmas presents and have insisted she's happy to claim state handouts and blaming the welfare system for her large family.

Mrs Prudham also revealed that her benefits help her fund a £30-a-week smoking habit and have paid for the family to redecorate their five-bedroom council house. 

The family were then photographed enjoying a two-week holiday in Menorca, which she insisted they 'deserved'.

Mrs Prudham had her first son George, 13, when she was just 17 and was living in a homeless hostel in Kent in the summer of 2000.

She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son, Jack, 12, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, eight.

She then had three unplanned pregnancies; Maisie, seven, Lillie, five, and Madison, four.

In March 2009, she met current husband Rob and they had Leon, now three. They then had Lenny, now two, before she gave birth to daughter Lainey in January last year.

She then had twins Lacey-May and Lexi-Rose this autumn.
