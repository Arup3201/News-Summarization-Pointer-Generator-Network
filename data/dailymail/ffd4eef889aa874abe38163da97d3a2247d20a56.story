A luxury hotel in a former Victorian sea fort a mile off the Hampshire coast, in the middle of the busy Solent, is set to open this autumn.

No Man's Land Fort, where more than 100 soldiers once slept in hammocks and endured spartan living conditions defending England against foreign invaders, will be a four-and-a-half star chill-out base equipped with a helipad.

Amazing Venues, set up by entrepreneur Mike Clare, already runs a similar exclusive hotel at neighbouring Spitbank Fort.

He says the new hotel will open in October in No Man's Land Fort, one of a chain built a mile from Portsmouth Harbour to guard us against the French fleet in 1878.

Mark Watts, Solent Forts' general manager, said the 22 bedrooms for 200 guests in the new hotel are being completed ahead of its opening later this year.

'It is going extremely well - on Spitbank we are 100 per cent full until November.

'Every day we are full to capacity. That is what has spurred us on to move No Man's Land Fort forward.'

The opening of the new hotel will mean a change for the existing, five-star Spitbank Fort, which will become an exclusive-use venue.

'We have done that because the new hotel is going to be so much larger,' said Mark.

'It will be three times the size of Spitbank and an awful lot more room for guests.

'There are bigger rooms, and there is a special atrium in the middle of the building.

'We are putting in fun things like laser quest and virtual golf practice and we will have a cabaret bar and lots of other new things.'

Unique: The unusual, luxury hotel will have capacity for 200 guests in 22 rooms

Around 80 staff are set to work on the fort, with a further 40 already employed at Spitbank Fort.

Portsmouth City council recently approached investors to try to secure more exclusive hotels for the city.

Councillor Donna Jones, leader of the council, said: 'Portsmouth has so much to offer the high-end market.

'I'm delighted that Mike Clare has invested so heavily by acquiring forts in the Solent.

'My desire is to have another five-star hotel in Portsmouth to accommodate the America's Cup and preliminary races that Sir Ben Ainslie will take part in.'

Councillor Luke Stubbs, cabinet member for planning and regeneration, added: 'It is giving the local economy a boost to have another premium hotel in the city.'

The forts were fitted with massive cannons to repel the French Navy. Now the gun ports are bedroom windows offering sea views and the gunpowder rooms are cosy snugs.

Blitzed by Nazi bombers during World War Two, the forts were decommissioned by the Ministry of Defence in 1982.

Fifteen foot granite walls will protect guests from the roughest of weather.

Rooms in the basement contain artefacts including giant bellows used to heat up the forge and a large muzzle cleaner.

Outside, visitors can take in the sea air and fish for mackerel, bass and pollock which swim in the waters surrounding the fort.

Where anti-aircraft guns once stood, there's a sun deck where guests and wedding parties sipping champagne and eating canapes can watch boats passing in and out of Portsmouth Harbour.

There's even a hot tub on the roof terrace and a crow's nest bar.
