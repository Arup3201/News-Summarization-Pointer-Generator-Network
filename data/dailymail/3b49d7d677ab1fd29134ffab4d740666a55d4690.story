Celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis announced her split from husband Todd Thompson after 11 years of marriage last week.

But the breakdown in their relationship quickly spawned unfounded claims of an affair with the Today show's Matt Lauer.

Then there were also rumors concerning fellow chef Bobby Flay, after the pair were seen dining together in New York just days before the 44-year-old Food Network star announced her breakup at the end of December.

However Giada has now said any suggestions of romance involving the two - which first surfaced in Star magazine - were false. 

Strictly professional: Celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis says any suggestion of a romantic involvement with Matt Lauer (left) or Bobby Flay (right) are false, following her separation with husband Todd Thompson

'My long-time friendships with my co-workers Matt Lauer and Bobby Flay are exactly that — long-time friendships,' she said in a statement to website Gossip Cop.

'There has never been a romantic relationship with these two men,' she added.

Giada and her husband, fashion designer Todd Thompson, separated in July but only announced the split last week.

The couple have a six-year-old daughter, Jade.  

Their separation comes three years after Giada was forced to deny claims she had been cheating on Todd with musician John Mayer, 37. 

Denial: Three years before announcing her split from husband Todd Thompson, Giada De Laurentiis was forced to deny claims she had hooked up with John Mayer 

Speaking to Redbook magazine about the claims in 2011, Giada called it unexpected and insisted nothing had happened with the Your Body Is A Wonderland singer. 

Star magazine reported that the duo had a 'steamy hookup' at the Gansevoort Hotel in New York, in 2010 but Giada revealed her husband was actually in New York with her when she was alleged to have been with John.

And she revealed Todd's embarrassment that his family in Michigan might believe it was true. 

She told Redbook: 'I was shocked. And not so much for me, but for my husband and family. My family is used to that sort of thing. But my husband's family is not. Todd was embarrassed that his family in Michigan would see it and think, What is going on over there in Hollywood?'

Giada admitted she had met John in the past but insisted it was nothing more than a brief introduction and she hadn't seen him in three years before the alleged fling took place. 

John's rep also told E! News: 'The claims are absolutely ridiculous.' 

Giada's representative told MailOnline on Wednesday: 'She barely knows John Mayer. She met him at an event and chatted with him for about five minutes and that is the extent of her contact with him.'

Separate paths: Giada and Todd, shown in February in New York City, separated back in July

The chef and Todd appear to be having an amicable split, with Giada writing on Facebook: 'After an amicable separation since July, Todd and I have decided to end our marriage. Although our decision to separate comes with a great deal of sadness, our focus on the future and overwhelming desire for our family's happiness has given us the strength to move forward on separate, yet always connected paths.

'Todd and I share a beautiful daughter and a lifetime of great memories that we both treasure more than anything. We are so thankful for our friends and family, and really appreciate the support in this time of change,' she added.

The statement did not mention if divorce proceedings had started.

'Thanks so much for your support in this time of change...', Giada tweeted on Monday night to her more than one million followers on Twitter.

The couple were married in May 2003.

Giada won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2008 for Outstanding Lifestyle Host for her show Giada At Home.

She was born in Rome, Italy and her maternal grandfather is the noted Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis whose producing credits include the Fellini films La Strada and Nights Of Cabiria and the 1992 cult classic Army Of Darkness.

After her parents' divorce, she and her siblings moved to Southern California, where they grew up.

Giada graduated from UCLA in 1996 with a degree in social anthropology.

Along with her cooking show and contributions to the Today show, Giada also came out with a line of kitchen supplies for Target in 2010.
