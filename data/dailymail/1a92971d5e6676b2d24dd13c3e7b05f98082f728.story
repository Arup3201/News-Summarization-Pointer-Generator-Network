A 14-year-old schoolboy has been told he can't fly his flag collection in his own back garden because of just one anonymous complaint.

Liam Kenward, 14, has collected more than 200 flags in the past 10 years and enjoyed flying five at a time on two 20ft flagpoles in his secluded garden in Loose, Kent.

But he has received a letter from the local council telling him he needs permission to fly more than two flags at a time - and can only have one flagpole a maximum of 10ft tall.

The pupil at Valley Park School in Maidstone collected the national and nautical flags from  antiques fairs and rotated the selection every day.

'My flags are my passion and I'm really disappointed that I have to take them down,' he said.

'We've been living here for two years and I always thought everyone liked them.

'I'm really sad about taking them down as I bought so many and now can't even display them.

'I'm considering giving up the hobby because I can now only really put up one and it's not enough for how many I have.'

The 14-year-old has been forced to take down two poles - one in the front garden and one in the back - along with three small flags mounted on top of the family's 9ft hedge.

He has reduced the height of one of the poles and now only just flies above the hedge.

His mum Tracey, 50, who owns her own gardening business, said Liam's hobby kept him on the 'right route'.

He received a letter from the local council telling him he needs permission to fly more than two flags and the family put up a notice saying: 'This is very disappinting'

He enjoyed flying five at a time on two 20ft flagpoles in his secluded garden in Loose, Kent, but he is only allowed one 10ft pole now 

She said: 'He's so proud of the flags. He's completely gutted as it's his passion and he's been working on it for a decade now.

'What's sad is he isn't a malicious or badly behaved teenager vandalising anything.

'He's a smart boy who uses his passion to find out about the world and it's helped to keep him on the right route.

'We have never displayed any offensive flag and Liam is keen to put up flags of every nationality.

'He also puts up nautical flags and none of them are right in people's faces.

'He then teaches the school kids walking past about all the flags which is a really good thing and he knows the flags of practically every country now.

'They were only small flags and he's devastated to take them down. We don't understand why he can't display them if he wishes in his own garden. 

'The person who complained could have just knocked on the door so we could discuss it with them, rather than complaining to the council.'  

He has collected more than 200 flags national and nautical flags in the past 10 years from antiques fairs

Liam would sometimes rotate the flags every hour if a big football game was on to represent the two countries playing.

And on occasions when the Union flag is officially flown at half mast he would do the same.

The family put up a notice to neighbours outside their house explaining they had been asked to remove the flags due to a complaint.

It said: 'This is very disappointing to us, as we consider ourselves very approachable people, but more so for our son, as the flags are a huge passion of his.'

One neighbour, a former police officer, has written to Maidstone Borough Council and their local MP supporting Liam.

The family will now be applying for planning permission to fly five flags at once. 

A Maidstone Borough Council spokeswoman said: 'We investigated after receiving a complaint about the number of flags.

'Planning legislation in England allows two flags to be flown in the grounds of a building (subject to certain conditions) without planning permission, but if a resident would like to fly more flags at their property, they need to apply for planning permission.'
