The mystery of Arizona Cardinals outside linebacker John Abraham's recent absence from training camp may have been uncovered with the revelation that the NFL star was charged with driving under the influence while leaving a Georgia strip club in late June.

ESPN reports that Abraham was found unconscious in the driver's seat of his black Dodge Challenger at roughly 4 p.m. June 29 shortly after exiting the Pink Pony strip club.

According to the police report it took officers several minutes of hammering on the car door to wake the NFL's active sacks leader.

Abraham was allegedly leaving the Pink Pony strip club in the late afternoon when police found him

'He appeared confused and rambled while speaking,' according to a TMZ review of the police report.

The 36-year-old failed multiple field sobriety tests but reportedly declined a breathalyzer.

An officer confiscated his South Carolina driver's license which was found to be under suspension.

When questioned about Abraham's three-day absence from training camp during a Monday morning appearing on Arizona Sports 620, Cardinals general manager Steve Keim dismissed speculation anything was wrong.

'I'm not concerned at all,' he said on the Doug and Wolf show. 'He'll be back at some point here.'

As AZ Central notes, this is the second time Abraham has faced DUI charges. He was busted after crashing his SUV into a Long Island fire hydrant while playing for the New York Jets in 2003.

In that case, he pled guilty to driving while impaired. He did not serve jail time.

Abraham is currently NFL's active sacks leader.

Cardinal's coach Bruce Arians declined to comment on what the June incident meant for Abraham's status with the team.Â 

Cornerback Patrick Peterson was more forgiving.

'He made a mistake. And he's still our brother. So we'll have to love on 
him,' Peterson told reporters. 'We'll have to care for him, and hopefully he won't make this 
mistake again to put this negative light on the Arizona Cardinals 
football team. We're looking to move forward from it. We can't wait to 
get him back just [to] see what kind of health and conditioning that 
he's in, and we're hoping that he can put up another double-digit sack 
season.'
