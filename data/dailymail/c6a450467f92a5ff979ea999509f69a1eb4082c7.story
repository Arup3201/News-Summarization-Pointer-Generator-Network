David Bott: Pay has soared from £140,000 in 2007 to £235,000 last year

One of Britain’s highest-paid quango bosses receives his £235,000 a year salary via a private company, it emerged yesterday.

David Bott, an ‘innovation director’ at the Technology Strategy Board, is the latest public sector official revealed to be exploiting a loophole that could save him thousands of pounds a year in tax.

The obscure quango, which was set up in 2007 to promote innovation in business, has paid him more than £1million in this way over the past five years.

The news comes amid mounting controversy over so-called ‘tax dodging’ in the public sector.

At least 25 senior staff at the Department of Health receive their pay via private companies, which are often registered at their home addresses.

Astonishingly, the head of a union for top civil servants has claimed that the controversial pay deals show that officials’ salaries are too low. Jonathan Baume, general secretary of the First Division Association, said the previous Labour government had tried to recruit senior figures from the private sector without matching their wages.

He said: ‘What we have found is that in certain cases, because the market rate was so much greater than the salary that would have been offered in the civil service, various deals were being done, and some of these are now being exposed.

From yesterday's Daily Mail

‘We now need to be very transparent, very clear that this cannot continue, but at the same time grasp the very difficult political nettle, which is to address pay at the senior levels of the civil service. Frankly it’s a shambles – ministers are going to have to raise the salaries.’

The Technology Strategy Board refused to comment on the details of Mr Bott’s remuneration pending a review by the Treasury.

The quango’s accounts show that Mr Bott is employed as a contractor, meaning his tax and National Insurance contributions are not deducted at source. They also show that his pay has risen sharply, from £140,000 in 2007 to £235,000 last year.

The revelation is a major embarrassment for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which sponsors the organisation.

A source at the department blamed the previous government for agreeing to Mr Bott’s employment status. They said he would be required to go on the quango’s payroll, with tax deducted at source, when his contract comes up for review in July.

‘This is a type of arrangement that we do not want to see continuing in the public sector,’ they added.

Emma Boon of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Taxpayers will be angry to see someone who receives such an enormous pay cheque from a taxpayer-funded body using a mechanism that could afford him significant tax advantages. It’s a ridiculous situation if even some people who are employed by the Government, directly or at arm’s length, aren’t paying the right taxes.’

Probe: Danny Alexander has ordered an urgent review into civil servants exploiting the tax loophole

Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, ordered an urgent review into the pay practice two weeks ago after it emerged that the head of the Student Loans Company, Ed Lester, used a similar arrangement to cut the tax bill on his £182,000 salary. Mr Lester was placed on the organisation’s payroll following public outcry.

Last December, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department of Health told shadow Cabinet Office minister Gareth Thomas that they did not employ any civil servants via private companies. However, leaked emails from the Department of Health suggest that officials may have deliberately misled Parliament to avoid ‘reputational’ damage and any resulting tax investigations.

Mr Thomas said he was writing to all government departments to demand a clear statement on the situation – but Labour’s efforts to make political capital out of the situation were undermined as it emerged that shadow health secretary Andy Burnham employs his own chief of staff using the same technique.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles yesterday introduced rules requiring local councils to publish full details of the pay deals of senior executives. They will also be required to review pay arrangements that ‘could be perceived as seeking to minimise tax payments’.

Mr Pickles said: ‘Local people have a right to know whether any town hall tax-dodgers are short-changing the public purse.’
