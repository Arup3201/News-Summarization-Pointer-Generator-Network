Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera was  among a host of footballing figures named by Spain's anti-corruption prosecutor on Monday in an alleged case of matchfixing involving a La Liga game in the 2010-11 season.

The United midfielder was mentioned alongside other prominent names such as Atletico Madrid captain Gabi and Japan coach Javier Aguirre.

Spain's anti-corruption prosecutor filed its case in a Valencia court following a probe into Real Zaragoza's 2-1 win at Levante on the final day of the campaign, which meant Zaragoza avoided relegation.

Mexican Aguirre was coach of Zaragoza at the time, while Spaniards Herrera and Gabi were both playing for the club.

Former Zaragoza president Agapito Iglesias and the club itself were also named as defendants, along with the rest of the players from both teams.

In its court filing published on Monday, the prosecutor alleged that the Levante players were paid a total of €965,000 (£766,000) in cash to deliberately lose the game.

Zaragoza allegedly first made bank transfers to their players and officials, including Aguirre, Herrera and Gabi, and  then took the money out of their accounts in cash and passed it on to the Levante players, the prosecutor said.

The judge overseeing the case will now rule on whether to proceed with prosecution.
