On a night Brentford opted to celebrate their 125th anniversary, they again showed why supporters continue to flock to Griffin Park.

It is their first season back in the second tier since 1992 and they plan to savour it. The attacking brand of football Mark Warburton wants to play may not always yield results, but is reason enough to continue to turn up.

More than 10,000 were packed into the tight Griffin Park on Tuesday night as this club keeps growing. They may not always see results that their dominance deserves - notably at Wigan last weekend - but provide value for money.

Summer signing Moses Odubajo takes on Joe Mattock and was a threat down the right for Brentford

What the Bees do have are a raft of exciting players going forward. Moses Odubjao - a £1million summer signing from Leyton Orient - is threatening on the right, while Jota on the other side is devlish in possession.

They saw a bullet Jonathan Douglas header cleared off the line and Andre Gray strike correctly disallowed for offside before he fluffed his lines in front of goal after the break. The breaks didn’t appear to be with the hosts. 

Warburton said: 'Both sides had chances, you won't see a better 0-0 draw. They posed a real threat. We've got to be more clinical.

'We played some good football tonight.' 

Stuart Gray's Sheffield Wednesday are reborn and potent themselves, too, and bossed this for large parts. The Yorkshire side - who play slightly more direct with the two tenacious strikers Atdhe Nihiu and Stevie May in their midst - have goals in their side too. May struck a post before seeing a fierce effort well blocked by Harlee Dean.

During a night that carried on swinging this way and that, former Celta Vigo winger Jota blazed over when he should've done better as Chris Maguire drew a very smart save from home goalkeeper David Button.

Brentford: Button 7; McCormack 6; Dean 7; Craig 6; Bidwell 6; Douglas 7; Pritchard 6.5; Odubajo 6; Judge 6 (Diagouraga, 77 - 6); Jota 6.5 (Proschwitz, 76 - 6); Gray 6.5 (Toral, 84 - 6)

Subs not used: Bonham, Toral, Alves Coelho, Yennaris, Moore

Booked: McCormack 

Sheffield Wednesday: Westwood 6; Palmer 6; Lees 7; Loovens 6.5; Mattock 6; Maguire 6.5; Semedo 6; Lee 7 (Madine, 73); Helan 7; Nuhiu 6.5; May 7.5 (Drenthe, 84)

Subs not used: Coke, Maghoma, Hope, Dielna, Kirkland

Booked: Mattock, May 

Nerves kicked in as the final third approached. Jeremy Helan somehow conspired to trip over when offered a very presentable opportunity just nine yards out, while Alex Pritchard was incapable of finding the final ball to unlock the Wednesday back four.

Tackles flew in, tempers flared and the intensity remained high. Neither side opted to sit in as both continued to commit plenty of bodies forward. Pritchard buzzed and Gray schemed - only denied by a last-gasp Glenn Loovens tackle. Brentford did look the more likely after the arrival of lanky striker Nick Proschwitz - giving them an added dimension, but Wednesday almost caught the Bees cold as Helan tried to atone for his earlier stumble. He wasn’t, however, able to skip by Jack Bidwell.

Not even former Real Madrid star Royston Drenthe entering the fray late on could steal all three for Gray. It was another night when it was apparent that new-thinking Brentford belong at this level, although it would have been so much more had Proschwitz connected at the back post in the 89th minute with goal gaping. 

Gray said: 'Brentford put us under a lot of pressure, credit to them. Not many teams will come here and get a clean sheet like we have.

'How it ended up goalless I don't know. We need that goalscorer.'
