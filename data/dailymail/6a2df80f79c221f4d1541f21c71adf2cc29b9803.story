A slaughterhouse owner paid to kill animals badly hurt during the Grand National is one of three people arrested by police investigating how beef products became contaminated with horse meat.

Peter Boddy, 63, is accused of fraudulently selling equine flesh for use in kebabs and burgers sold in Britain, the Food Standards Agency said today.

Aintree on Merseyside, the home of the world's most famous horse race, has confirmed it sends fatally injured horses to Mr Boddy's slaughterhouse in Todmorden, West Yorkshire.

Last year's fallen favourite Synchronised, ridden by legend A.P. McCoy, was put down at the site, and an Aintree spokesman said last night: 'We are as confident as we can be that no unfit meat reached human food.'

It is understood that Dafydd Raw-Rees, 64, and Colin Patterson, 42, of Farmbox Meats, based near Aberystwyth, have also been arrested.

Mr Boddy has been accused by the FSA 
of providing horse carcasses to their company, which were subsequently 
processed and passed off as beef.

ASDA last night withdrew sauces and soups from its shelves after the discovery of horse DNA in one of the products.

The supermarket pulled cartons of 
fresh Bolognese, Beef Broth Soup, Chilli Con Carne Soup and Meat Feast 
Pasta Sauce, made by a single supplier.

The
 manufacturer, Greencore, makes sauces and meals for a number of 
supermarkets, including Sainsbury’s and the Co-op, suggesting further 
withdrawals are likely.

It is understood Asda has a positive 
DNA result for the bolognese sauce but a spokesman added: ‘We have no 
positive test results for horse DNA in any of the other products but we 
feel it is the right thing to withdraw them as a precaution.’

Supermarket giant Asda announced it had 
withdrawn its 500g Beef Bolognese Sauce, left, from sale after tests 
indicated the presence of horse DNA. Its 600g Beef Broth Soup, right, 
was also withdrawn as a precaution

Concerns: The supermarket chain also withdrew 
its 500g Meat Feast Pasta Sauce, left, as a precaution as well as the 
400g Chilli Con Carne Soup, right

Sainsbury’s said it was carrying out 
tests for the presence of horse DNA but added that Greencore used a 
different beef supplier for its products.

A spokesman said: ‘Greencore makes 
some of our pasta sauces. We are testing those that contain beef. 
However, we know that our beef is from a different supplier to that used
 by Asda.

'Ours is from a British supplier, 
Asda’s is from southern Ireland. We have already carried out tests on a 
range of our beef products including burgers, ready meals and minced 
meat and no trace of horse DNA has been found in any of our products.’

The Co-op said Greencore supplies six pasta sauces to the company, but none of these include beef.

Meanwhile, Morrisons has removed two 
beef salami products from 11 stores as a precaution while tests are 
carried out. There is no evidence the products contain horse meat. The 
manufacturer says the lines are made in the UK from British beef.

Held: Dafydd Raw-Rees, owner of Farmbox Meats, pictured today, was arrested this evening

In custody: The owner of Welsh factory Farmbox Meats, which is at the centre of the horsemeat scandal, was tonight arrested by police. The factory is pictured today

The move came as the millionaire owner
 of a meat processing factory was among three people arrested as part of
 a fraud investigation linked to the horse meat scandal.

Yesterday’s arrests are the first in 
the UK as part of a joint investigation by the FSA and the police into 
alleged criminal attempts to pass off horse meat as beef.

It is understood that Dafydd Raw-Rees
 and Colin Patterson, of Farmbox Meats, based near Aberystwyth, and 
slaughterman Peter Boddy, from West Yorkshire, were taken into custody.

Earlier this week, the police raided 
the Welsh factory and an abattoir operated by Mr Boddy. Mr Raw-Rees, a 
former Lib Dem councillor and president of the local golf club, 
defiantly told journalists how his staff were still preparing  horse 
meat for a foreign company – despite an order to cease operations – and 
declared his innocence of any breaches of food safety.

Mr Boddy has been accused by the FSA 
of providing horse carcasses to Farmbox Meats which were subsequently 
processed and passed off as beef.

Worrying: Supermarket giant Asda announced it had withdrawn its 500g Beef Bolognese Sauce from sale after tests indicated the presence of horse DNA. Three other products were also withdrawn

Meanwhile, the French government named
 a company called Spanghero as being guilty of ‘an economic fraud’. It 
said the firm had knowingly imported horse meat from Romania before 
re-labelling it as beef and sending it on to firm Comigel, which used 
the meat to make meals, including lasagnes for Findus, Tesco and Aldi.

Speaking about this evening's arrests, a Dyfed-Powys Police spokesman said: 'Dyfed-Powys Police have today made
 arrests at both meat plants inspected by the Food Standards Agency on 
Tuesday.

'At Farmbox Meats near Aberystwyth, Dyfed-Powys Police have arrested two
 men aged 64 years and 42 years, and in a simultaneous operation police 
arrested a man aged 63 at the Peter Boddy Slaughterhouse in Todmorden, 
West Yorkshire.

'Approvals for both operations were suspended yesterday by the FSA so neither firm was operational.

'Dyfed Powys Police can confirm the three people have been arrested on 
suspicion of offences under the Fraud Act and they are being detained at
 Aberystwyth Police Station where they will be interviewed jointly by 
Police and FSA staff in what has this afternoon become a joint 
operation.'

Mr Raw-Rees has denied any wrongdoing and says he is fully licensed to process horsemeat at his plant.

He claims horse carcasses are shipped in from Ireland to be boned and cut up before being packed and sent to Belgium.

Mr Raw-Rees, a former county councillor, employs 14 staff at the plant which has ceased production during the investigation.

He has also been revealed as a millionaire who enjoys a jet-set lifestyle.

The 64-year-old has been pictured holidaying on a yacht and at a star-studded ball in Abu Dhabi, where he once attended the local Grand Prix.

Last night, the French government accused Spanghero of 
knowingly selling horsemeat masquerading as beef which ended up on 
British plates.

The firm was accused of being ‘guilty of an economic fraud’ and the French government said it was ‘well aware’ that the Romanian ‘beef’ 
they were dealing in was in fact horse.

The firm, which had repeatedly denied knowing its meat was horse, immediately had its licence to trade withdrawn.

Speaking at a press conference in Paris,  France’s consumer affairs minister Benoit Hamon unveiled a hard hitting initial report into the European-wide scandal.

Mr Hamon said that companies from 
Romania, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and France were all 
involved in the supply chain that resulted in horsemeat reaching British
 supermarket shelves.

Spanghero, which is based in the rural south west near Toulouse, exported
 their Romanian meat to the French frozen food giant Comigel. It was 
eventually sold on to British companies including Aldi and Tesco.

Mr Hamon said that Poujol, the holding company of Spanghero, ‘acquired the frozen meat from a Cypriot trader who had subcontracted the order to a trader located in the Netherlands, who in turn was supplied by an abattoir in Romania.’

Mr Hamon said a ‘fraudulent trade’ in ‘beef’ had been going on since at least August, with receipts suggesting that it has been worth around 300,000 euros.

He suggested that some of the 
consignments of meat Spanghero were dealing in were ‘100 per cent 
horse’, yet they continually denied trading in it.  

Earlier, it emerged that Spanghero was billed for 42 tonnes of low grade horsemeat on January 4.

Le
 Parisien newspaper published a bill that was made out to Spanghero and 
printed on the headed paper of Draap Trading, the Dutch-run which is a 
Cyprus-based intermediary which sourced meat in Romania for Spanghero.

The
 bill contains the numbers 0205 0080 – the international code for frozen
 horsemeat – and related to the fat, tendons and other pieces left over 
after the horse has been deboned and the prime cuts removed.

Romanian
 officials have been angered by what they see as an attempt by the 
French companies involved in the scandal to point the finger of blame at
 their abattoirs.

They 
insist horsemeat leaving their slaughterhouses would have been clearly 
labelled as such and that the fraud must have occurred further along the
 food chain.

Spanghero, which is based in 
Castelnaudary, near Toulouse, said in a statement earlier this week that
 it did not ‘sell, re-sell or process horsemeat in any form.’  Spanghero
 denied receiving any bill for horsemeat from Draap Trading.

Spanghero
 is a subsidiary of Lur Berri, a Basque agricultural cooperative which 
has 5000 farms supplying it, and which has a turnover of close to 1 
billion pounds a year.

Under pressure: Spanghero exported its Romanian meat to the French frozen food giant Comigel. Its offices in Metz, eastern France, are pictured

Just 20 months ago Spanghero was at the centre of a major E.coli scare, when inspectors feared that some 12 tonnes of beef mince from its plant was riddled with the potentially lethal bacteria.

Spanghero, which was founded in 1970 by Claude and Laurent Spanghero, two former France international rugby players, insisted that it had been given a clean bill of health following the E.coli scare.

Despite Spanghero’s multi-million pounds profits, its pre-cooked meals are widely mocked in a country which takes its food extremely seriously.

There is a Facebook page dedicated to the ‘inedible products’ of Spanghero, and it has more than 25000 members, many of them French people who object to flagship products including veal in champagne sauce.
