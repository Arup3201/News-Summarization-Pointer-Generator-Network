Ordeal: The ferret grabbed on to Mrs Taylor's leg while she travelling back from the shops in her mobility scooter

A grandmother was left bleeding and in agony after she was mauled by a ferret that leapt onto her mobility scooter.

Florence Taylor, 86, was left housebound after the animal came 'out of the blue' and pounced when she was on her way to the shops.

It sunk its razor sharp teeth into the heel of her left foot and hung on for several minutes, Mrs Taylor said. 

The former dinner lady, who has
a heart condition, was only able to fight the ferret off by thrashing 
it with her walking stick with the help of a neighbour. The creature then scuttled down an alley and has not been seen since.

It is not known where the ferret came 
from or if it was wild or kept as a pet.

The
grandmother of ten, from Bingham, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘It was the 
last thing I expected after popping down the shops. It just came out of 
the blue and sank its fangs into my leg

'My shoe was full of blood. It was 
very scary - I just didn't know what to do. I gave it a hefty whack with
my walking stick but it didn't do much good.

'You
hear about people being bitten by a dog - but not really a ferret. 
Maybe it was trying to get up my trouser leg like they say they like to 
do. It was scary and I've never felt pain like it, they've got pretty 
sharp teeth. It was a very traumatic experience.'

After the attack Mrs Taylor called her daughter, who dressed the wound.

The pensioner then went to her GP 
where she was given a tetanus injection and a course of antibiotics. She
was left unable to walk for several days.

Mrs Taylor is prescribed blood thinning drug Warfarin - which means her blood has difficulty clotting, and she bleeds for longer if she cuts herself.

She added: ‘I do all my own shopping and usually go round to a friend’s every morning but I haven’t been able to since.

‘I will definitely be wary when I do go out.’

Recovery: Mrs Taylor is started to heal after her ordeal. However she has been left too traumatised to leave the house following the attack

Traumatised: Mrs Taylor is fearful of another ferret attack

She is now too scared to leave the house as she fears 
the animal, which she believes escaped from someone's house, has now got
a 'taste for her blood'.

Mrs
Taylor’s neighbour, who helped fend off the ferret, did not want to be 
named, but said: ‘I noticed something darting around her scooter. I was 
very surprised. There was a pool of blood on the road.

The 57-year-old added: ‘I was just trying to bat it away - it was bizarre.

‘It’s a bit worrying - imagine if it had attacked a child. You just don’t expect these things.’

Graham Harrison, 52 who lives on Hill Drive where the incident took place has two ferrets, but said that his were locked away.

He
added: ‘They are quite friendly as I handle them every day – they are 
pets. It couldn't have been them though – it must have been a wild one 
to attack someone like that.’

Mrs
Taylor said she thought the police didn’t believe them. ‘They said if 
it’s a dog then we would come out – but not for a ferret,' she said.

Ferrets generally have a reputation as pleasant creatures.

Andy Handley, chairman of the British Ferret Club, said: ‘It’s not something I have come across often.

‘They only bite generally if they are frightened. If they do bite because they are scared they will sink their teeth in and stay locked on.’

Sharp gnashers: The NSPCA said the ferret attack was not something they would deal with (File picture)

Nottinghamshire police said it was not a criminal matter. The RSPCA also said it was not something they would deal with.

Residents in the nearby area expressed their shock at the attack yesterday.

Mike Rand, 69, said: 'It's surprising, I have never heard anything like it. You just don't expect it.'

While hairdresser Jade Shields, 16, added: 'Where on earth did it come from? I would have been very scared.'
