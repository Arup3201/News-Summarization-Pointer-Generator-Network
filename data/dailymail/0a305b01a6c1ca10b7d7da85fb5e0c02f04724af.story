Liverpool will provide the perfect environment for Mario Balotelli to thrive as he will no longer have to be a leader, according to his agent.

In an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport, Mino Raiola said Balotelli was not born to be a leader and that Liverpool’s captain Steven Gerrard will protect the striker and allow him the freedom to concentrate on firing Brendan Rodgers’ side to the title.

‘I searched for a team where he can be an important player without being asked to lead,’ said Raiola, who also represents Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba.

‘Liverpool have Gerrard so Mario will be protected and there he will be at his best. Now it's up to him. Another flop is not recommended.

‘Not everyone is born to be a leader and often good strikers are not good leaders. Mario needs to get out from behind this pressure so he can feel free to score goals.’

When asked if Liverpool was Balotelli’s last resort, Raiola said: ‘At the highest level, yes. It is all or nothing.

‘Mario is 24 years old. He can no longer use his age as an excuse.’

Raiola, who was speaking to Corriere dello Sport via Skype from Manchester Airport, said Liverpool had been watching Balotelli for three months after it became clear the striker needed to cut his ties with AC Milan.

‘Balotelli’s contract will be completed on Monday or Tuesday. I still have so many little things to fix. Today (Saturday), meanwhile, Mario has his medical.

‘The negotiations have been very smooth and fair. They have been going on for three months. It is not a scoop. Liverpool is the only English team that I have dealt with regarding Mario.

‘The truth is that I'm working on Mario for months: it was time to divorce from Milan.

‘I have always been negative about him returning to play in Italy, because of the pressure, the expectations, the press.

‘It is much more difficult for him to play in Italy than it is for him to play abroad. But he insisted when he left Manchester City that he wanted to go to Milan.

‘I cannot blame Milan for anything. It is a great club. Mario played well for six or seven months, gave a decisive contribution in getting them to the Champions League, but then we saw that he is not ready to be a leader.’
