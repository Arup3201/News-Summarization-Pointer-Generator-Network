Former Australia cricketer Shane Warne has finally confirmed he is in a relationship with Playboy model Emily Scott after the pair were pictured kissing in Sydney last month.

Warne revealed the news on Twitter on Wednesday night as he headed to Wimbledon to watch fellow Aussie Nick Kyrgios play Milos Raonic.

He wrote: 'Ps And yes I'm taking my girlfriend @EmilyLScott who's looking smoking hot too hahaha !!!'

The pair have attended several events together in London in recent days, including a Coldplay concert and after party.

They also spent time in Paris prior to the London jaunt, as a photo posted to Warne's Instagram account revealed.Â 

Warne had denied the pair were anything more than friends, responding to the speculation via a tweet last month:

'Wow, 8 years of friendship, a full moon party & attending a mates 50th turns into us dating? Whats next, down on a knee!'

But now he has held up his end of the deal he made fans on social media last month, insisting he an Scott were not a couple - but if they ever were, he wouldn't hide it.

'We're good friends. Both single and intent to keep it that way, end of story,' he had said.

'If and when I'm ever in a relationship, I will let you know!!'

The model, who also works as a DJ, looked a a little too worse for wear to walk out of the Coldplay after party herself on Tuesday night, with Warne picking her up and carrying her out of the Kensington Roof Gardens venue.
