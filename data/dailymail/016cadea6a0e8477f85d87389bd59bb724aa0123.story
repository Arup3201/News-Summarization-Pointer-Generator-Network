To many they are a symbol of old, rural ways – a traditional way of heating a home and conserving fuel.

But the woodburning stove has become the new badge of middle-class success – with more and more families spending upwards of £3,000 to have one fitted.

At least 175,000 households are installing a woodburner each year, five times more than in 2007, according to Hetas, the industry regulatory body.

And the trend has led to an increase in the number of installers registered with Hetas, up from 791 in 2007 to 3,252 today.

Experts say sales of woodburners began to increase at the height of the recession as homeowners tried to reduce energy bills.

But they have also become a trendy centre-piece in the homes of many families – with new designs featuring bright colours, sleek and modern shapes and big glass windows.

The endorsement of woodburners by celebrities including pop star Lily Allen, celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, and the property developer and television presenter Sarah Beeny, have also helped to sustain the stove as a ‘must-have’ in home-decoration.

They are also becoming increasingly fashionable in towns and cities.

‘Until recently, stoves were very much a backwater. They were for people who lived in big draughty homes in the country,’ said Paul Chesney of Chesney’s, a woodburner supplier.

‘That has changed radically. In particular, we are seeing a new metropolitan, urban taste for woodburners.’

Chesney’s sold more than 600 stoves in central London last year.

One man saw such a market in them that he gave up his £100,000-a-year IT job in 2011 to found Windsor and Eton Stoves, a woodburner supplier.

Chris Croft said he expects turnover will triple this year compared with 2012 and intends to open a shop in London in time for Christmas.

‘It’s a quality of life thing and the industry is really growing,’ he said. ‘Are woodburners the new Aga? Probably, yes.’

The cost of buying and installing a woodburner begins at about £3,000 but can cost in excess of £10,000 for some of the more modern or ornate designs.

David Webb and his wife Jamie, who have two children Jacob, seven, and Sydney, two, recently spent £6,100 on buying and installing a woodburner in their barn conversion in Charlton Kings, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

‘We wanted a woodburner because we are traditionalists at heart,’ said Mr Webb, director of an IT company.

‘Our dream was to have the kids opening their presents by the burning fire at Christmas.’

Despite the installation costs, wood for a stove can be cheaper to burn than other fuels.

Burning wood costs an average of 4p a kilowatt hour compared with 5p for gas and oil and 15p for electricity.

It also emits less carbon dioxide, a factor that attracts those concerned about the environment.

‘Most of the new models now . . . give out such low emissions that you can burn wood legally in smoke-free zones in towns and cities,’ said Cedric Wells, of stove manufacturer Charnwood.

‘This has really opened up the product to city and urban areas — the southeast has been the area of growth recently and some of our stockists are now booked up until Christmas.’

A growing number of people are spotting a gap in the market and training to become chimney sweeps.

The National Association of Chimney Sweeps has seen the number of participants at its training courses is up 36per cent since the beginning of the year.

‘We are taking on all sorts of people — from a BAE Systems engineer to ex-teachers,’ said Martin Glynn, the president of the association.

Estate agents in London estimate a woodburner could increase the value of a property by up to 5per cent.
