Gordon Strachan compared Scotland's bruising, euphoric victory over the Republic of Ireland to a heavyweight title fight.

Shaun Maloney's sublime goal 15 minutes from the end of a tight, nip-and-tuck qualifier with the Irish completed a memorable and crucial Euro 2016 victory.

Drawing level with the Republic on seven points after Poland's emphatic 4-0 win in Georgia, the Scots secured all three points in a frenetic clash.

Strachan will now ring the changes for Tuesday's friendly with England after admitting the game wrung every ounce of effort from his men.

'I think so,' confirmed the Scots boss. 'They put so much into that game tonight. That was like one of those big heavyweight boxing matches.

'I absolutely wouldn't second-guess the outcome of this group now.'

The Scots had some sterling individual displays in goalscorer Maloney and man-of-the-match Charlie Mulgrew, called into midfield after an illness to James Morrison before the game.

'Charlie was immense, absolutely immense,' said Strachan. 'Normally we would come in here and say: 'What a game Scott Brown has had'. But Charlie has actually taken the mantle tonight and ably backed up by the people round about him.

'I am really pleased with Shaun as well, as I am with Steven Naismith, Ikechi Anya and others but Charlie was the best man on the pitch I think — ably backed by the others.

'But the smaller ones like Andrew Robertson, Maloney, Naismith and Anya showed brave play when the ball was flying about and there were tackles everywhere.

'They showed bravery on the ball.'

Poland's triumph in Tblisi ramped up the pressure on the Scots before kick-off. Strachan had dismissed talk of a 'must-win' beforehand, but the joyous celebrations of the Tartan Army afterwards told another tale.

'People have been telling me since the Georgia game it is must-win,' the Scotland boss said. 'They said it before Poland and this one. Every game seems to be a must-win.

'I said before the game that one goal had decided all of the previous games in the group, apart from the one involving Gibraltar. It has happened again.

'We did say set plays were going to be vital and it happened.

'As for a pure footballing spectacle, it wasn't that great.

'But as a spectacle of two groups of players not wanting to give an inch, it was mesmerising. They all wanted to jump higher than each other, run quicker and battle harder.'

The Scots blew a raft of chances in both halves and survived a moment of anxiety in injury time when Grant Hanley's defensive header almost spun into his own net, crashing off the bar.

Insisting his team now believe in themselves after one defeat in four matches — to world champions Germany in the opener — Strachan added: 'When we've played we've believed we can play football. Tonight it was a more physical duel.

'We dealt with that as well because the players trust each other.

'They know fine well if they're not having a great night the guy next to him will help them out.

'And I think that's what happened tonight.'

Asked what his over-riding emotions were ahead of an England friendly at the same venue, Strachan said: 'There are lot of emotions chucked in there, every emotion possible. But the good thing is I can go home, get to my bed and chill. That's what I'll do, go home and watch a bit of telly and fall asleep. I'm looking forward to that.'
