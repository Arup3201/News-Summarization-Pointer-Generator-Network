A California high school made history on Friday when it elected its first transgender homecoming queen in the school's history. But what the 16-year-old thought would be 'the happiest night of my life' ended with her recording a tearful Youtube video describing how the negative feedback hurt her more than it ever had before.

Cassidy Lynn Campbell, 16, is now the reigning homecoming queen at Marina High School in Huntington Beach. At her crowning ceremony, she instantly fell to the ground and started crying tears of joy.

She says the honor is bigger than just her.

Campbell says she realized her win wasn't just for her but for other transgender kids who may be struggling

'If I win it would mean that the school recognizes me as the gender I 
always felt I was,' she told the L.A. Times earlier this month. 'But 
with all the attention, I realized it's bigger than me. I'm doing this 
for the kids who can't be themselves.'

According to the paper, Campbell began taking estrogen injections and hormone blockers when she entered high school as she started her transition from male to female. She's documented her transition on Youtube, offering fashion and makeup advice for other transgender children.

"I realized it wasn’t for me anymore and I was doing this for so many 
people all around the county and the state and possibly the world and I 
am so proud to win this not just for me, but everyone out there,” she 
told KTLA.

Campbell says she decided to run for homecoming queen earlier this year to make a statement.

While most of the kids at the school accept Campbell as female and were excited to see her win, it appears some weren't - which prompted the heartbreaking Youtube video.

In an explanation of the video, Campbell says she has never been so hurt by negative feedback as she did following what she thought would be 'the happiest night of my life.' 

Heartbreaking: Campbell says the negative feedback about her win hurt her more than ever before

'After 16 years of struggling, I finally do it and I finally am myself --
 thinking I'll be so happy,' she said in the video. 'It's just sad that everyone has 
to be so judgmental about it, and so hateful, and so mean and so 
negative. I've never done anything to any of these people. And I don't 
know why they have to be this way, when I've done nothing to them. It 
just hurts so bad because I feel just as much of a girl as all of them 
do... Everyone is just so ignorant.'

She went on to question whether her transitioning to male was even worth it.

'Sometimes I wonder, ''is it even worth it?'' And if I should just go back to being miserable and just be a boy...so everyone will just shut up and leave me alone,' she says in the video.

Campbell is only the second transgender student to be elected homecoming queen by her peers. In 2009, Jessee Vasold was named homecoming queen at Ailliam and Mary in Virginia.
