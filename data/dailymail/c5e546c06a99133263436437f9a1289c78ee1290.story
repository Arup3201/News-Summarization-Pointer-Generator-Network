Charged: PR guru Max Clifford faces 11 counts of sex abuse

Police are investigating a television comedy legend about historic sex abuse allegations, it was revealed today.

Officers working on the Jimmy Savile scandal have opened a file on the household name who is in his seventies.

The unnamed star denies the claims, but he could be questioned under caution before a decision is made whether to formally arrest him.

He has been under investigation for several months. In a separate development, a woman has alleged on Twitter that she is the victim of a celebrity assault.

The investigation is the latest shock to hit the entertainment world and comes as  PR veteran Max Clifford was charged with 11 counts of indecent assault against teenage girls.

Since Operation Yewtree was launched in the wake of the scandal involving shamed DJ Savile, 12 men has been formally arrested over historic sex abuse allegations dating back to the 1960s.

They include entertainer Rolf Harris, pop star Gary Glitter, DJ Dave Lee Travis and comedians Freddie Starr and Jim Davidson. All deny the allegations.

Over the past weeks, calls from 
alleged victims have flooded into police naming more celebrities. They 
believe they will be taken seriously following coverage in the media.

Questioned: Comic Jim Davidson

A
source told the Sunday Mirror, who claim to know the identity of the unnamed celebrity: 'The comic being investigated is another
on an increasing list of those who will have to answer allegations of 
abuse.

'But if it wasn't 
for the press publicising these arrests it's doubtful whether the 
alleged victims would have come forward. They simply did not think 
anybody would listen.'

Speaking outside his Surrey mansion yesterday, Mr Clifford told how he felt sorry for the celebrities who were caught up in the Savile investigation.

He said: 'I just feel sorry for Freddie [Starr]and David Lee Travis and Jim Davidson and people I have known for many, many years because I know they are not that type either.

'I wish they [the police] would concentrate on the kind of Jimmy Savile types and those around Savile and the like.'

He described the allegations against him as 'nonsense' and said he was '100 per cent confident' he would clear his name in court.

Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree has so far cost £1.8 million with 69 officers investigating various cases.
