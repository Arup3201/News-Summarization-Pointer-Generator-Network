An experienced skydiver from California was killed on Saturday night after slamming into the ground while attempting an advanced maneuver known as ‘swooping.’ 

Donald Brown, 43, of American Canyon, was pronounced dead minutes after he deployed his parachute above Byron Airport.

The victim’s friends told the San Francisco Chronicle that the 43-year-old, known as ‘Donny,’ had been skydiving for 20 years, but may have misjudged his altitude and therefore had too little room to perform the risky landing move.

The U.S. Parachute Association describes ‘swooping,’ or canopy piloting, as a skydiving discipline that involves hurtling down at high speeds and then decelerating by turning horizontally just above the ground.

Contra Costa Sheriff's Office spokesman Jimmy Lee says the accident is regarded as a non-criminal death.

Officers, fire crews and paramedics arrived at Byron Airport at around 7:40pm on Saturday after receiving a report about a skydiving accident. Brown was pronounced dead at the scene.

People who witnessed the accident told police that as Brown was descending, his parachute opened fully but it appeared like he was going to miss his landing target.

Club: Brown was affiliated with the Davis-based Skydance Skydiving, where he organized events and mentored fellow enthusiasts of the sport

The 43-year-old attempted the ‘swooping’ move in an effort to redirect himself to his target, but did not have sufficient altitude to complete the maneuver and struck the ground at a high rate of speed, according to Lee.

People who knew Brown described him 
as a highly skilled skydiver who specialized in 'freeflying' - a 
discipline in which skydivers manipulate their bodies in a way that 
allows them to fly through the air rather than fall.

Tragic: Brown is survived by his fiancee, Courtenay Bost

'It was just a landing accident,' Brown's friend Scott Meeker told the Chronicle. 'His descent rate was too high, and he hit the ground too hard.'

Brown, who had 3,000 skydives under his belt, was a mentor to other enthusiasts of the high-flying sport and helped organize events at the Davis-based club Skydance Skydiving.

'Donny was the friendliest, most positive smiling guy you could ever want around,' said club president Ray Ferrell.

He also added that the 43-year-old was striving to perfect the sport and push the envelope in skydiving, which at times leads to fatalities.

People who knew the 43-year-old said that besides skydiving, Brown was also a skilled mechanic, race car driver and painter.

He is survived by his fiancee, Courtenay Bost, his sister, Cynthia Brown, and his mother, Barbara Brown.
