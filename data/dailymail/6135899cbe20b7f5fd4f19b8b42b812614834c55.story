Raheem Sterling should ignore interest from  Real Madrid and commit his future to Liverpool for at least the next three years, according to former Red John Barnes.

England international Sterling has been involved in protracted negotiations over a new contract and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers confirmed earlier this month that the forward had been offered a 'wonderful deal'.

But Sterling appears to be in no rush to put pen to paper and talks have stalled between the club and his representatives as the player continues to be linked to Champions League winners Real.

And Liverpool legend Barnes has warned Sterling against moving on too soon and urges him to remain at the club.

'If I was Raheem Sterling I would stay with Liverpool for the next three years,' Barnes told hinch.as.

'I've seen it with other young players, a lot to do with their agents, a lot to do with the money they have been offered, that they rush off to big clubs.

'Of course Liverpool is a big club, but the temptation must be to go to Real Madrid or Barcelona or wherever, but the danger is that you can be lost to the game, and I can give you so many examples, like Jack Rodwell who went too early to Manchester City and Scott Sinclair who also went to Manchester City.

'With all due respect to clubs like that, they might turn out to be worse for them, and they end up going back and then not getting a move again.

'I would advice young players not to rush, but to stay at their clubs until they are 23 or 24. I went to Liverpool at the age of 23 by which time I was a 35 cap international player who could handle it.'

Former winger Barnes played for Liverpool for 10 years from 1987 and made more than 400 appearances
