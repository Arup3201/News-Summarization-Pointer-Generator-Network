A bad night for football, an even worse one for Manchester City.

City just cannot get to grips with the Champions League, its unique mental demands and its relentless rhythms.

At half-time Manuel Pellegrini’s team were seemingly back on course after poor results in their opening two games. They had played beautifully at times and led comfortably after goals from Sergio Aguero and James Milner.

By the end, however, City were staring at a disappointingly early end to their Champions League season yet again. As peculiar as it is to say, the current English champions continue to stand still in Europe.

This was a pretty grim experience all told in Moscow.

Freezing temperatures, a stadium echoing to the boorish, boozed-up chanting of CSKA fans who shouldn’t have been anywhere near the place and a late penalty decision so dreadful it’s tempting to check the Hungarian referee’s passport for Russian lineage.

CSKA are a dreadful club. Ignorant to the behavioural problems that afflict them and their supporters, they were contemptible and contemptuous all at the same time.

Officials brushed aside suggestions that CSKA fans had been given access to the main stand and attempted to blame UEFA. As they left the room, they were applauded by their own media. The World Cup here will be a hoot, won’t it?

All of this will irritate City, of course.

It will be a frosty boardroom at the Etihad Stadium when the teams reconvene next month. Last season, the CSKA party turned up in jeans. Here, some of City’s most prominent officials – including their chairman and chief executive – didn’t even attend. 

That says everything.

What will bug Pellegrini and his players most, however, is the result and their second half performance.

Pellegrini summed it up best when he said afterwards that he hoped people would see performances of Premier League standard from his team as they go after the three wins they will need to qualify between now and mid-December.

Certainly, what City continue to serve up in Europe is unrecognisable from the football they routinely play domestically.

They were so superior in the first half that they should have been out of sight. By the end, though, they were hanging on for a point. Bizarre. Truly bizarre.

And so to the good part. CSKA began the night well and were briefly lively in front of Joe Hart’s goal.

A long shot from Ahmed Musa had Hart scrambling early on before former Manchester United winger Zoran Tosic cut inside to curl a left foot shot wide with Hart once again in some trouble.

Certainly there was enough there early on to cause City some concern and twice in the opening twenty minutes captain Vincent Kompany had to contribute vital tackles, once to stop Tosic and then to thwart Musa after a heavy touch from the striker.

Slowly, though, City took hold of the game and twice they could have taken the lead before they actually did score as Pablo Zabaleta and Milner volleyed wide of either post from tight angles after good balls from the impressive YaYa Toure.

When City did score, it was a super goal.

David Silva split the CSKA defence with a through ball to Edin Dzeko and the Bosnian waited for Aguero to arrive to his right before slipping the ball to his partner for his eleventh goal in as many games this season.

Coming in the 29th minute, the goal served to settle City down and suck a little of the life out of the Russians. At least for the time being. As such it was no surprise that City scored again before half-time.

Again it was another lovely team goal and this time Aguero played his part in its creation, volleying the ball across goal for Milner to score from a yard after Zabaleta had headed a Toure diagonal ball down in to his path.

There was still time for City to strike the post – Milner again – before the interval and Pellegrini’s team went in at the break knowing they were halfway to getting themselves right back in to the group. After that, though, it all went wrong.

CSKA played a part in their own revival. Their coach Leonid Slutski changed his formation and threw on Seydou Doumbia, who was to be influential.

Nevertheless, it was City who lost their tempo, City who lost their momentum and their pace of play. As a result, it was City who began to experience danger where previously there really hadn’t been any.

The turning point arrived with 25 minutes left. City gave the ball away cheaply, central defender Eliaquim Mangala left flat-footed by a ball inside his right shoulder and when Mousa crossed low Hart and Kompany were left on their backsides as Doumbia bundled the ball in from six yards.

It was a blow but it needn’t have been fatal. City were still ahead. Briefly they rallied and regained some authority but still they gave the ball away and when the defining moment arrived at the death they played their own part in it.

Certainly it was a shocking decision by referee Vad. To suggest Alexsandar Kolarov impeded Doumbia was preposterous. If anything, the foul was by the attacker. But Pellegrini will have noticed that Toure initially surrendered possession with a cheap back heel in his own half and by the time Bebras Natcho despatched the penalty the City coach was buttoning up his coat in anticipation of some tough questions.

Pellegrini didn’t discuss the referee but his silence on the matter spoke volumes. In terms of his team he knows the script. They are not good enough. A bad night, indeed.
