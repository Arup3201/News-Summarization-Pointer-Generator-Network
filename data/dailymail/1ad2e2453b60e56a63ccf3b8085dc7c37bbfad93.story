Remember the famous chestbuster scene from classic 1979 film Alien, when a parasitic alien burst out of Sigourney Weaver's stomach?

Well, this horrific video shows something similar, but real.

It shows a man spraying a praying mantis with pesticide, killing it instantly, only to see seconds later a huge worm bursting out of the body of the dead insect and wriggling across the floor.

The video shows a praying mantis insect walking across the floor being prodded by the person shooting the video shortly before they grab a can of insect spray, and spray the green insect which is killed instantly

The clip starts with the praying 
mantis insect walking across the floor being prodded by the person 
shooting the video shortly before they grab a can of insect spray, and 
spray it.

The insect dies.

But
 seconds later something can be seen moving at the rear of the insect 
and then a huge worm almost as big as the praying mantis that it was 
infecting bursts out and wriggles across the floor.

Experts
 shown the video by German newspaper Bild said it was clearly a parasite
 that had been eating the praying mantis alive from the inside.

It
 would have eventually been killed when the worm was ready to escape. 
They said it appeared to be a horsehair worm or Nematomorpha.

The praying mantis is a protected insect in Germany where it is extremely rare but it is not clear where the video was shot.

It has been described as a real-life enactment of the famous scene from Alien when a man sprayed the praying mantis with pesticide, killing it instantly, only to see seconds later a huge worm bursting out of the body of the dead insect

The video was posted last May but only went viral this week.

The experts said that nematomorph hairworms do not just colonise the belly of their hosts, they eat them alive causing erratic behaviour that can make the insects to fall into water - perfect for the parasite as they need water to reproduce.

In 2002, researchers investigated anecdotal reports of insects infected with the parasite 'committing suicide' by jumping into water.

The researchers compared the behaviour of crickets infected with the worm against uninfected crickets, and found the infected ones were more likely to jump into the water.

Water is fatal for the crickets, but the parasite relies on the water to reproduce.

The worms can grow to two metres long, and the adults live freely in water, but the larvae are parasitic on various insects and crustaceans.

Some of viewers on You Tube expressed doubts about the authenticity of the video, but Professor Christopher Darling from the University of Toronto said it's a fairly common phenomenon.

He said: 'I am pretty sure that this is real, and not a hoax. I have seen and photographed similar things a number of times.'

Darling, who is also a senior curator of entomology at the Royal Ontario Museum, said the worm was likely tightly packed inside the abdomen of the insect until the insect died.

'And yes, they do look very long, but they are very skinny,' he wrote.
