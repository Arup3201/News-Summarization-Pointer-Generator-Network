'Attack': Michael Callaghan allegedly sexually assaulted a 20-year-old woman on Sunday

A 911 dispatcher told a distraught woman to 'quit crying' after she called to report that she had been raped.

The startling lack of sympathy emerged when WSYX asked the Columbus Police Department for a recording of the call that had been placed around 4am on Sunday.

The woman can be heard sobbing as she told the female dispatcher that she had awoken in her friend's dorm to a man telling her to carry out a sex act on him - and threatening to shoot her if she did not comply.

Afterwards the man allegedly stole cash and an iPhone from the building, which is an off-campus house for sorority girls at Ohio State University.

The distraught 20-year-old woman ran from the house and called 911.

On the recording, she tells the dispatcher that the man broke into the house full of girls and woke her up with a gun to her head, before assaulting her and stealing the items.

When the dispatcher asked her for her address, she said she was from out of town and didn't know exactly where it was. She asked the dispatcher if she was able to trace her phone.

'No. We can't,' the dispatcher says impatiently. 'That's why I need to know where you are.'

Scene: The woman was staying with a friend off campus near Ohio State University (pictured) when she was awoken by a man holding a gun to her head. When she called 911 she was met with 'zero sympathy'

The victim said that her attacker was a small white male with a white shirt - and begged the dispatcher to arrest him immediately.

'Ma'am, youâ€™re going to have to quit crying so I can get the information from you,' the dispatcher responded.

And when the woman said she was not sure exactly how the rapist got into the house, the tetchy dispatcher said: 'Well, they're not going to be able to find him with the information that you've given.'

By that point, the victim had had enough.

'Don't you understand how horrified I am?' she said through tears. 'I am a 20-year-old from Upper Arlington. I don't know what you deal with every day, but the kind of sympathy you have is zero.'

No apologies: Dispatcher chief Lieutenant Marc Dopp said the dispatcher would not be reprimanded because the suspect was caught. He conceded that the call could've been handled better

Police went on to arrest and charge Michael Callaghan, 30, with rape and burglary in relation to the attack.

Victim to dispatcher

A 911 supervisor told WSYX that the dispatcher could have handled the call better and that it will be reviewed - but that she will not be reprimanded because the suspected was caught and charged.

'We want [dispatchers] to be empathetic 
but at the end of the day we have to get [the victims] help,' CPD's 911 
dipatcher chief Lt. Marc Doff told WSYX.

She will not be receiving a written warning and the incident will not go on her record.

The Columbus police did not return MailOnline's request for a comment.
