A striking photo taken by an environmental conservation group in Queensland has gone viral.

The picture features a group of people with their heads buried in the sand to highlight the lack of action by the Australian Government on climate change.

The words 'Townsville salutes the Australian Government for their achievements in combating climate change' are printed alongside the image. 

The image was taken on The Strand Beach in Townsville, northern Queensland, and has featured on a medley of sites around the world, including eminent American site Buzzfeed

Taken on The Strand Beach in Townsville, Northern Queensland, the picture has featured on a medley of sites around the world, including eminent American site Buzzfeed, which titled an article on the image as 'The One Picture That Perfectly Sums Up World Action On Climate Change'.

The image was a collaboration between production team Cranky Curlew as well as the North Queensland Conservation Council. 

The NQCC organised a local climate change protest on Sunday that coincided with The People's Climate March In New York - the largest climate protest in history - which attracted more than 300,000 people.

The co-ordinator of the NQCC Wendy Tubman told Daily Mail Australia: 'We wanted to make a comment on the total lack of responsibility from the Australian Government. They are acting like climate change isn't there.'

Ms Tubman explained that she wanted to reach as many people as possible with the image. 

'We wanted to get this out to many people as possible. 

'That's the real advantage of internet based activism: once you've seen it, you can share it with your own circles, and it can quickly grow to a much larger audience than a protest.'

The production company that took the photo - Cranky Curlew Productions - used the protest on Sunday as the basis for the photo.

 'They had planned it all thoroughly beforehand, arranged for all the participants to take part, so when it came down to capturing the image it happened very smoothly. People were happy to take part.'

Head of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon at the opening of the 2014 Climate Change Summit in New York, where he warned that 'humanity has never faced a greater challenge than climate change'

An unidentified woman performed a similar act last week when she buried her head in the sand and held up a 'No Gas' sign 

She says the major environmental threat facing Australia is mining. 

'Coal mining is the biggest contributor to climate change. The Australian Governments support for this industry - which is not only dying but deeply damaging to our way of life - is the equivalent of supporting the tobacco industry.'

Last week, a woman engaged in a similar protest on Bondi Beach, burying her head in the sand and brandishing a sign reading 'NO GAS'.  The unidentified woman was apparently protesting the use of Coal Seam Gas, a naturally occurring substance which can only be accessed through mining. 

The news comes as the Head of the United Nations, Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, has warned that 'humanity has never faced a greater challenge than climate change', at the opening of the 2014 Climate Change Summit in New York.

On Sunday the Foreign Affairs Minister, Julie Bishop, attended a meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change in New York. She confirmed Australia's commitment to reduce its emissions by 5 per cent of 2000 levels by 2020.

By contrast, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by the United States discusses a 30 per cent reduction in emissions by 2025, and recommendied other nations make similar cuts. 

Prime Minister Tony Abbott didn't attend the Climate Summit on Tuesday, despite being in New York the following day for talks on the Islamic State.
