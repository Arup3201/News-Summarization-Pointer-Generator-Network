A drunken, unruly airline passenger groped three women before air marshals arrested him and the London-bound plane turned back to Philadelphia, according to court documents.

Robert John Coppack, 40, of La Verne, California, will remain in custody until a detention and probable cause hearing Monday in federal court.

According to an FBI affidavit, two women sitting with Coppack complained about his behavior on the overnight US Airways flight Tuesday, prompting the crew to steer him toward the back of the plane.

Charged: 40-year-old Robert John Coppack is charged with intimidation of a flight crew member and other offenses

Offloaded: Robert John Coppack was moved to the rear of the plane, where he was restrained until the aircraft returned to Philadelphia and taken away. He is now in custody

Turning back: The flight only got as far as Cape Cod before it was forced to turn around

Coppack then groped a retired flight attendant as he walked down the aisle, the affidavit said.

Coppack, who told his seatmates he had been drinking vodka, was also aggressive and verbally abusive, the affidavit said.

He was detained on board by an air marshal on the flight, and later charged with intimidating the crew and interfering with their work.

Neither a public defender assigned to his case nor relatives listed at his California address returned calls for comment Wednesday.

Flight attendants sent him to the back of the plane, and that’s where federal air marshals met him. 

But the incident was not quite over.  The allegation is that he threatened physical assault on the marshal.

Uneasy: California resident touched two female passengers 'inappropriately;' the women told flight attendants that they didn't feel comfortable sitting next to him

Going nowhere: The flight was heading to London Heathrow on a 6 hour flight from Philadelphia when it turned back about an hour into its journey

The plane arrived at Heathrow Airport in London about four hours late, airline spokeswoman Michelle Mohr said.

Coppack was traveling on a British passport, and told officials he has dual citizenship, the affidavit said.

Authorities say he could spend up to 20 years behind bars.  He’ll be back in court on Monday for a detention hearing.
