Alex Song has put Premier League clubs on red alert with the Barcelona midfielder ready to return to England this summer.

The Cameroon midfielder left Arsenal in a £15million deal ahead of the 2012-13 season.

But his future at the Nou Camp is uncertain following the arrival of new manager Luis Enrique.

Eyes up: Song is likely to be on his way out of Barca, with several Premier League clubs bound to be interested

Back again: Former club Arsenal are one possible destination for the Cameroon midfielder

And Song is keen on a return to these shores if he is deemed surplus to requirements after less than two years in Catalonia.

Song has been linked with a move to Liverpool and Manchester United in recent weeks, while the Gunners are also in the hunt for a holding midfielder.

The 26-year-old spent nine seasons at Arsenal, making 206 appearances and scoring 10 goals.

He became an integral part of Arsene Wenger's midfield plans during his time in north London.

Bayer Leverkusen's Lars Bender is Wenger's primary midfield target, while the club are also keen on Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin.
