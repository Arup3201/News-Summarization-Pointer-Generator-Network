Yvonne Musonda-Malata was found guilty of failing to provide appropriate clinical care to Baby A at a Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing

A midwife faces being struck off after she was found guilty of leaving a newborn baby in a hospital stationery cupboard.

Yvonne Musonda-Malata, 35, left the four-day-old child’s cot in the unlit and unventilated cupboard – where the little one was found covered in vomit, on her stomach and suffocating.

The midwife admitted removing the ‘unsettled’ girl so that her mother could get a night’s sleep, but denied putting her in the cupboard.

Nursing regulators have ruled that she did so and are meeting today to decide whether Musonda-Malata’s extraordinary actions amount to misconduct – for which the sanctions include a ban from practising.

The case, being heard at the Nursing and Midwifery Council in London, comes as NHS staff have been warned they may in future face criminal charges if they neglect patients.

Musonda-Malata’s actions at the Queen’s Hospital in Romford, Essex,  were only discovered when nursery nurse Alex Curtis went to get an envelope – and was horrified to find the baby shut in with the stationery.

The child is believed to have been there for around 20 minutes.

Musonda-Malata, who was suspended but continues to work at Queen’s, initially admitted responsibility, but later changed her story and accused Miss Curtis of lying.

Nursing and Midwifery Panel chairman Lesley White said yesterday: ‘The panel found Miss Curtis to be a credible and consistent witness.

‘She had no motive to be untruthful and the panel has no reason to believe she was mistaken.’

She said that Musonda-Malata’s decision to shut the baby in the cupboard ‘amounted to a failure to provide clinical care’.

Another midwife was also charged over the incident, which took place in April 2011. Christine Onoade, 46, was cleared of involvement – but has since been sacked from the hospital.

Christine Olukemi Onoade was cleared of all charges today. The midwife had been accused of failing to provide appropriate care for the baby, and claimed her life had taken a 'nosedive' in wake of the scandal

Musonda-Malata claimed she left the baby in Onoade’s care while she was away with another patient.

But
the hearing heard that when she was asked, immediately after the baby 
was discovered, what she had done, Musonda-Malata told ward sister 
Martina Cheng: ‘I have made a mistake, I’m in big trouble’.

The midwives were entrusted with the baby while its mother, who suffers a health condition, was resting at Queen's Hospital in Romford, north east London

Musonda-Malata
later claimed that her confession was inaccurate and only made because 
she was not in ‘the right frame of mind’ and ‘just wanted to write 
something in the notes and get out of the place’.

Musonda-Malata’s
claims were rejected by the panel, which also found her guilty of 
failing to provide appropriate clinical care in that she did not 
accurately record the baby’s feeds while she was in her keeping.

Onoade was cleared of the same charge after the panel ruled that had not been part of her duties.

Speaking
after the decision, Onoade said she was relieved to be cleared but 
described the case as a ‘nightmare’. Musonda-Malata was unavailable for 
comment.

The women faced a hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council in central London. Ms Musonda-Malata is yet to be informed if she will face punishment
