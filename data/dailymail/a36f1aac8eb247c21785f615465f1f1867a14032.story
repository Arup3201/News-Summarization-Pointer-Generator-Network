A man who found a phone in a lake was amazed to discover it still worked - despite spending a quarter of a year submerged.

Roger Nilsson contacted the Facebook page of Nokia Sweden to tell them about how he found his Lumia 800 - lost three months ago - wedged between two rocks in the lake.

Intrigued, he took the phone, which was encrusted with mud, shells and other waste, back to his home and cleaned it up, took it apart and left it to dry on his radiator.

When he reassembled it he was stunned to discover it was able to make calls and even the camera still worked. The battery too had lost none of its potency, lasting two days from a full charge, reports the Times of India.

What makes the discovery even more incredible is the phone is not designed to be any more water resistant than any other smartphone on the market.

Even phones marketed as water-resistant are only rated to survive under water for a maximum of 30 minutes, let alone more than three months.

He posted: '(I) took it home and started to clean as best I could, shells and muck on display, green goo around the entire phone and some other stuff. Let it dry on a radiator and then I put in the charger cable.

Nokia Sweden was impressed with his story, posting: 'Woaw! Really nice story, thanks for sharing it with us'.

Nokia user Ashif Chowdary was also impressed, writing: 'Absolutely incredible, as most other phones break when you drop them from the coffee table height.'

Nokia has a legacy of making durable handsets, from the old 3315 to the new Lumia range.
