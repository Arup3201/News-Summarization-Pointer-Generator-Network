NBA star Brandon Jennings’ wedding plans have hit a hitch after it was revealed that he must first wait until his fiancée has divorced her common-law wife.

The future Mrs Jennings-in-waiting is Tae Heckard, 36, a video vixen turned actress who previously dated rapper Nelly and met Jennings, 24, through his ex-fiancee Teyana Taylor.

The Detroit Pistons point guard and his girlfriend have posted photos on Instagram of them enjoying a romantic getaway this week, but meanwhile she has set about legally clearing the way for the love birds to tie the knot.

Heckard, whose best known acting gig was a recurring role on BET’s The Game, has filed papers to end her domestic partnership with a woman named Monique Blanton, reports TMZ.

The pair became domestic partners in 2008 and according to court docs filed in L.A. County Superior Court, Heckard even took Blanton's last name.

The couple separated in 2011 citing irreconcilable differences.

In April, Jennings posted a photo of himself and Heckard on Instagram in which she was wearing what looked like a large diamond on her ring finger. Along with the photo was a caption, ‘We don’t care. What you think!!!’ The photo was later taken down.

Heckard has previously dated hip hop star Nelly. They had met when she starred as eye candy in the video for his 2005 song Grillz

The relationship between Heckard and Jennings may even have started while he was still seeing his ex

Heckard has previously dated hip hop star Nelly. They met when she starred as eye candy in the video for his 2005 song Grillz. She even has his nickname, Mo, tattooed on her lower back.

It is believed the pair split earlier this year after he was reported to have got back together with his ex-girlfriend of nearly 10 years, singer Ashanti.

Heckard was first introduced to Jennings via her ex-friend and his ex-fiancee Teyana Taylor, who is signed to Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. record label.

The relationship between Heckard and Jennings may even have started while he was still seeing his ex. In a radio interview earlier this year Taylor said she wished Jennings nothing but happiness but felt betrayed by Heckard.

'There’s always that one girl that you go through everything with. So at that point, you don’t shock her anymore. Brandon doesn’t even shock my anymore.

'So my issue isn’t with Brandon. I’m not even upset because I know him. My issue is with Tae because we were friends,' she told the Breakfast Club.
