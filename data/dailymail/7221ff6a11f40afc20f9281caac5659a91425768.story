Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is spear-heading an ambitious new effort to extend Internet access across the developing world by lowering the cost of getting online.

The new project, called Internet.org, launched early Wednesday morning. It is a collaboration of some of the largest technology companies in the world, including handset makers Nokia and Samsung, telecom giant Ericsson, and chip designer Qualcomm. 

The project's goals are lofty - helping to make the Internet affordable for five billion people people in developing nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America. But, the methods are decidedly not flashy.

Leader: Mark Zuckerberg is behind a major push by several tech companies to expand internet access to 5billion people in the developing world

The 29-year-old billionaire took to his own Facebook page to promote the project by asking 'Is connectivity a human right?'

Unlike Google's Project Loon - which aims to extend internet access in remote areas across the developing world by sending large balloons into the sky - Internet.org seeks to improve efficiency through better programming.

Facebook is trying to streamline its mobile app so that it consumes less internet bandwidth and is therefore cheaper to run for users paying by the megabyte.

Cellphone makers are trying to design handsets that have longer battery lives and draw internet bandwidth more efficiently.

In five to 10 years, Internet.org hopes to reduce the cost of providing mobile internet by 99percent.

'The goal of Internet.org is to make Internet access available to the two-thirds of the world who are not yet connected and to bring the same opportunities to everyone that the connected third of the world has today,' Zuckerberg said.  

Inspiring words: The project used the words from President John F. Kennedy's 1963 speech on peace in a nuclear world in a video introducing the idea

The project focuses largely on mobile phone connectivity because billions of people in developing countries already use cell phones for talk and text. Smart phones are also more affordable than personal computers and they are often more practical in regions with spotty electricity.

Internet.org went live early Wednesday with a slickly-produced site 
promoting the project. It features a moving, highly-polished that sets 
the words of President John F. Kennedy's 1963 American University speech
on world peace to images of peoples in developing nations across the 
world.

'Today, Internet isn't accessible for two thirds of the world. Imagine a world where it connects us all,' the video intones. 

High hopes: Internet.org plans to leverage efficiency upgrades in mobile Internet technology to make smart phones and Internet access more affordable for billions

The 29-year-old billionaire is increasingly becoming a forceful public figure in public policy. He has previously spoken out about the importance of reforming the U.S. immigration system to make it easier to bring in skilled workers.

As with the immigration debate, Internet.org isn't entirely an egalitarian effort.

Facebook and the other partners in the project have already reached near-market saturation in the United States, Canada, Europe and other parts of the developed world.

Extending Internet access to the developed world is one way for Facebook to grows its base of 1.15billion users.
