Virginia Helena de Souza is accused of 'playing God' and killing up to 320 patients to free up beds

A woman doctor accused of killing up to 320 patients to free up hospital beds may prove to  be the world’s most prolific serial killer.

Virginia Helena de Souza, 56, may have ended the lives of more victims than Dr Harold Shipman, who murdered 215 patients over 25 years.

De Souza is accused of giving patients fatal drug doses or cutting off oxygen to those on life-support machines in her ward at the Hospital Evangelico in Curitiba, south Brazil.

She allegedly administered muscle relaxant drugs used to kill death row prisoners in seconds.

Police believe she picked off poorer 
patients who were staying for free under Brazil’s national health 
system, freeing beds for patients who could pay or had private health 
insurance.

De Souza was arrested last month over 
the premature deaths of seven terminally ill patients. An undercover 
police officer recorded her saying she wanted to ‘unclutter’ the ward.

But an inquiry by Brazil’s Department 
of Health has increased the number of patients to 20 with around 300 
other suspicious deaths still to be investigated.

Her husband, a doctor who died of intestinal cancer in 2006, is feared to have been her first victim.

Doctor Mario Lobato, leading the 
investigation, said de Souza  ‘played God’ by deciding which patients 
should die.

‘There are 20 cases which have already been closed, and we 
have nearly 300 cases still open which we are looking at,’ he said.

'In each case, the testimony of people who worked inside the hospital confirmed what we have found on the patient records.

‘All of them have the same modus operandi, the same relationship between the drug and death, and the same time between both.’

If confirmed, de Souza would surpass Britain's Harold Shipman as the world's most deadly doctor.

If the Brazilian Health Ministry's fears are confirmed, De Souza would surpass British GP Harold Shipman as the world's deadliest doctor

Shipman, who hanged himself in prison aged 57, murdered at least 215 patients aged between 47 and 93 over 25 years.

Dr Lobato said some of the patients were conscious and talking moments before they died.

He said: 'One was awake, being nebulised but not even connected to a respirator.

'This patient had asked his family to bring his glasses so he could do some reading while he was in the intensive care ward.

'Another patient had just asked a nurse for a cup of water.

'This nurse testified that one of the things she will never forget is that she didn't manage to give him the cup of water because by the time she returned he had already died.'

De Souza's lawyer, Elias Mattar Assad, said the doctor will protest her innocence.

She said: 'Soon we will be able to prove that what happened in that ward can be justified in medical writings.'
