Shirley Mason, 46, allegedly stole a $1,200 motorized wheelchair from Wal-Mart

Police in Michigan say they arrested a shoplifting suspect following her slow-speed getaway in a $1,200 motorized wheelchair shopping cart taken from a Wal-Mart.

Cops located 46-year-old Shirley Mason about 2 miles away from the store in Fruitport Township.

She was riding the stolen $1,200 cart with $600 in clothing, the Muskegon Chronicle reported.

Officers were alerted to the theft when a customer called Monday night to report someone riding a shopping cart from the lot at the store.

Mason told 
police she couldn't find anyone to pick her up from the store and took 
the wheelchair cart 'because she didn't feel like walking.'

She was caught carrying six grocery bags full of clothes, according to the Chronicle.

Mason later confessed to planning to sell the items, police said.

She is charged with organized retail crime and has a probable cause hearing Sept. 23.

Mason has posted bond and is expected back on Sept. 23.

Police said there was also a 53-year-old man with Mason when she was arrested.

The man, who was not named, was arrested on a parole violation.
