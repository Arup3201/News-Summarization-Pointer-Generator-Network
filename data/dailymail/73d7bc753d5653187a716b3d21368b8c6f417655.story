Dianne McGrath has always been the adventurous type.

She's run ultra-marathons, cycled 1233km from Adelaide to Perth in 40 degree heat and circumnavigated Australia on a replica of James Cook's ship.

But Ms McGrath, from Southbank in Melbourne, is now in the running to take part in one of the most adventurous missions to ever be planned in our solar system: a one-way trip to Mars.

More than 200,000 people applied for project, hoping to be one of four chosen to make the first mission in 2024

More than 200,000 people applied for the Mars One project, hoping to be one of the first four people to travel to Mars and begin setting up a sustainable human colony on the red planet.

Ms McGrath, 44, has made it to the top 705 candidates and in the coming months she is set to begin the next round of interviews to see if she suitable for the mission, which will leave in 2024.

Ms McGrath has no reservations about the fact that if she is chosen, and if the mission is successful, she will die on Mars.

'I think that adds to the excitement,' she told MailOnline.

'I'm going to die here on Earth if I don't go to Mars anyway.'

Ms McGrath, a former public servant who also worked in marketing in the pharmaceutical industry for 12 years, was drawn to the project as soon as she read about it.

'I just thought that would be amazing, just the most cool adventure ever,' she said.

'I like pushing myself to my extremes both physically and mentally. My attitude is I'll have a go at anything once.'

Her friends and family were totally unsurprised when they heard she had applied.

'They were completely supportive,' she said.

'I suppose the immediate response was "Oh my God, good on you Di."

'And then other people started thinking "Oh my God how you will live without your hairdresser".'

Ms McGrath applied for the program before telling her partner of 11 years, Michele, who just laughed when she finally came clean.

'She must have seen it somewhere as well so her attitude or comment was "Yes, I saw that and of course you would apply for that."

'I'm quite a lucky person, I win things in competitions, I've won holidays and things so when I entered and she found out she said "Because you win things you will win this and you'll get to go".

Ms McGrath sent a video application off in October last year and in December she found hout she had been shortlisted to the top 1058

After a round of medical tests she was again shortlisted to the top 705

'It's nice to know she has that faith in me.'

But the road ahead is going to be grueling.

If Ms McGrath makes it to the final 24 – six teams of four will train up until 2024 but only one will leave – she will have to train for eight years without knowing for sure that she'll be getting on the ship.

'The other [teams] have to train just in case because they can't replace an individual they have to replace the whole team,' she said.

The process will involve a lot of assessments to test her intelligence, knowledge and personality.

In 2012 Ms McGrath sailed on a replica of James Cook¿s ship the Endeavour, circumnavigating Australia from Albany in Western Australia to Lincoln in South Australia

If she makes it to the groups of four she will be put in a team of two men and two women from different regions around the world.

The aim is to start a colony that will produce its own oxygen, water and food and will waste as little as possible.

'We will create a bit of a new planet which is almost like a small version of United Nations, with equality in race and gender,' Ms McGrath said.

'It will be actually looking at the human condition and how we can learn to live together again and build a new society from equality.'

The selection process will ensure each team works well together and they will go through isolation training.

'The journey alone is a seven month journey from Earth to Mar,' she said.

'You're going to be in a tin can with three people, so you're going to want to like each other and be able to work together.'
