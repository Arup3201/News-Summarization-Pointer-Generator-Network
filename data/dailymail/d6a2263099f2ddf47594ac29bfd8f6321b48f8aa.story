In the money: Jim Taylor's salary will increase from £130,000 to £170,000

A Labour council has sparked fury by handing its chief executive a £40,000 pay rise while driving through deep cuts to services.

Rochdale Council, which is currently making £45million worth of cuts, has announced that Jim Taylor’s salary will jump from £130,000 to £170,000 after an external review found he was ‘underpaid’.

Other executives in line for a bumper pay rise include environment director Mark Widdup, whose salary will go up from £71,000 to a maximum of £109,000, and Mr Taylor’s deputy Linda Fisher, who will see her pay rise to £97,000.

However, ordinary council workers have had their pay rises capped at just 1 per cent and 150 council workers will lose their jobs as part of £45million spending cuts, despite council tax going up by 3.5 per cent.

The council’s Labour leader Colin Lambert defended the awards, saying it was ‘not good enough that previous management and leadership has allowed this council to linger at the bottom of the league’.

But the decision has provoked anger in the town, which suffers from some of the most acute poverty in the country.

Rochdale’s Labour MP Simon Danczuk said Mr Taylor’s 30 per cent pay rise was indefensible.

‘I
cannot support the council on this,’ he said. ‘This is a huge pay 
increase and it is unacceptable. Rochdale has suffered from a big fall 
in real wages in recent years and my weekly surgery is full of people 
struggling to make ends meet.

Ashley Dearnley, Conservative group leader on the council, said: ‘If this is implemented, it will do nothing to bridge the growing pay gap.’

He said: ‘If this is implemented, it will
do nothing to bridge the growing pay gap between the public and private
sector.

'Pay for council staff has been held down to a one per cent 
increase and we need to think about what is fair and acceptable, bearing
in mind that the Prime Minister’s salary is only just over £140,000.’

'Unacceptable: Rochdale's Labour MP, Simon Danczuk, said he could not support the rise

And
Liberal Democrat leader Andy Kelly said: ‘This will be a very bitter 
pill for rank-and-file council staff to swallow. They are suffering a 
below-inflation pay rise and there have also been widespread 
redundancies.’

The decision to hand out huge pay awards 
to senior executives came after the council hired private sector 
consultants to review salaries at the authority.

Consultants from the
Hay Group, which charged £27,000 for the study, concluded that Mr 
Taylor and his senior colleagues were seriously underpaid compared to 
executives at similar councils.

The council will meet this week to rubber-stamp the pay awards.

A council spokesman last night said 
the pay rises were part of a wider shake-up of senior management which 
would see total costs fall by more than half.

The
number of senior managers has been reduced from 24 in 2010 to just 10, 
producing savings of almost £1.5 million, the council said.

The 
council will meet this week to rubber stamp the pay awards. A spokesman 
said: ‘We currently have and will continue to have the lowest cost 
management team for large councils in the region.’
