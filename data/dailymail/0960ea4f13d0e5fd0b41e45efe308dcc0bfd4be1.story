Two British Airways pilots are under investigation after allegedly getting into a bar room brawl, it can be revealed.

Senior first officer Sean Murphy, 39, and pilot Paul Lytollis, 43, were enjoying an evening out at a bar in Houston, Texas, with other staff during a stopover when they came to blows.

According to sources, Mr Lytollis landed a punch on Mr Murphy which broke his jaw during the fight at the British-themed Sherlock’s Baker Street Pub in March.

Last night, British Airways confirmed an internal investigation was under way but refused to confirm details of the incident.

The Mail on Sunday understands that the pair have both been suspended until a decision is made over their futures but BA refused to  confirm this. It is not known whether there was any police involvement.

Staff at the pub recall a fist fight on one of the lower levels of the bar, which is just 200 yards away from The Marriott Hotel, where BA staff stay during stopovers.

One waitress said a group of British visitors were playing pool when there was a loud argument.

She said: ‘I don’t know what it was over, but there was a lot of shouting, some pushing and one of the men ended up on the floor. I remember one of the girls who was in the group was crying. They all left soon afterwards.

‘I wasn’t serving in that area but was walking back to the kitchen. The place was not that packed and I just glanced over. There certainly wasn’t a big group involved.’

She added that the group of six people were all casually dressed and the incident took place mid-way through the evening.

Mr Murphy lives in Twickenham, London, with his girlfriend, Emma-Jane Ellis, 33, who also works for BA as an air stewardess. According to his Friends Reunited page, he used to be married to Andrea, 41, and has three young children.

Last night, after being approached by the MoS, British Airways removed a two-minute clip featuring Mr Murphy from the company’s YouTube channel. When asked why it had removed the clip, BA said: ‘We review the content of our social media channels on a regular basis.’

Facebook pictures show Mr Murphy posing alongside Friends star Matt LeBlanc and partying with friends on a boat at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2010.

His Twitter profile says he is a ‘747 Pilot, Formula 1 fan. Lucky enough to be doing a job that combines all my passions’. When approached by The Mail on Sunday about the incident, he refused to comment.

Paul Lytollis lives with a woman called Louise Shaughnessy in a large three-storey semi-detached house in Hale Barns, Cheshire.

Yesterday a woman who opened the electric gates at Mr Lytollis’s home said he was not there and refused to comment when asked about the incident. Neighbours said he ‘kept himself to himself’. Last night, a British Airways spokesman said: ‘As this matter is currently under internal investigation it would be inappropriate to comment.’

Asked about the pilots being suspended, she said: ‘We do not comment on the status of individual staff members.’
