The 2014 version of the Brazil national football team is so full of holes it remains distinctly possible that somebody could yet give them a rather embarrassing hiding over the next fortnight.

Nevertheless, in the shape of their remarkable forward Neymar they boast a young footballer who seems determined to make this World Cup his own.

Can one player drive a nation to the ultimate glory all by himself?

Maybe not but he can make a heck of a difference and in the capital of his country last night, Neymar ensured his team ended the group stages on a rapturous high.

Certainly the Barcelona forward has tapped in to the emotion and warmth of this tournament.

On Monday night he got pushed in to the photographers by one Cameroon player and slapped in the face by another. He responded with goals, though, beautiful goals, and after each he was waving his arms at the crowd, imploring them to offer more from the towering stands of the magnificent Estadio Nacional.

It was a terrific sight, even if it didn’t completely mask Brazil’s frailties. There are simply too many of those to ignore but – after the lumbering Fred added a third goal in the second half and Manchester City’s Fernandinho came on to score a fantastic fourth  - it ensured that 70,000 people went home optimistic rather than concerned for the durability of Luiz Felipe Scolari’s side.

As the dust settled, it was hard to ignore Fernandinho’s impact. It is rather mysterious why Scolari doesn’t start with him. He is exactly the kind of pragmatic, intuitive holding player that this team needs.

The goal he scored was lovely, too. By the end, as Cameroon tired and ragged, Brazil had begun to knock the ball around with confidence and played their best football of the night and perhaps even the tournament so far.

Fernandinho’s goal came on the back of that football as four passes were exchanged to allow him to advance and poke a perfect shot across goalkeeper Charles Itandje and in to the far corner.

As auditions for a place in the last sixteen tie against Chile go, it was pretty convincing stuff from a player who did so much to assist City’s reclaiming of the Barclays Premier League trophy.

It is hard, though, to watch this Brazil team without being drawn to the sight of Neymar’s imperious play. A footballer with perfect balance, dextrous feet and a scrapper’s heart, he is a middleweight who punching ferociously at the highest level.

On Monday night Brazil did what Brazil do, which is to look capable and completely incapable at the same time, depending on which half of the field you were looking at. This is a team that often looks lost when it doesn’t have the ball, a team through which panic spreads when even the most basic set-piece is delivered in to their penalty area.

But when he needed them to calm their nerves, Neymar did not fail them. That is why he is the talisman of Scolari’s team.

Shoved in to the hoardings by Allan Nyom early on here, Brazil’s golden child ignored the offer of a handshake and exacted perfect retribution by scoring the opening goal.

Luiz Gustavo hussled for – and won – the ball down the left and advanced to cross low towards Neymar who opened his body and side-footed the ball left to right across Itandje and in to the corner. It was a super goal.

Moments later Neymar crashed a volley goalwards from 18 yards and though Itandje saved it looked as though Brazil would run riot.

Instead their own defensive frailties allowed Cameroon back in to the contest and for 15 minutes we saw the very worst of the hosts.

Dani Alves sliced one cross over his own bar in the 25th minute and then headed a corner against his own post and over. From the next set piece Cameroon scored.

The ball was cleared to the left side and when Nyom picked it up, beat the flat-footed Alves at the second attempt and crossed low to the far post, David Luiz was caught on his heels as Joel Matip ambled in to score.

It was an equaliser that Cameroon deserved. They had shown some spirit and some ambition.

Complaining: Marcelo shouts after being fouled in the first half

Soon, though, Neymar arrived to hurt them again, running on to a Marcelo header, cutting inside on to his right foot to shoot low to the goalkeeper’s left from 18 yards.

That rather discouraged Cameroon and thereafter there was just one winner.

Fred looked offside when he headed in Luiz’s cross in the 50th minute but as Brazil flourished late on there was no disputing the quality of Fernandinho’s goal.

By then Neymar had departed after one heavy tackle too many. A nation will pray for his recovery.
