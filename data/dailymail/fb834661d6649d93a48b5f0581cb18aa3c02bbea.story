Every bride and groom wants their wedding to be memorable, but how far will they go to ensure their 'I do' is forever etched in the memories of their family and friends?

It seems your imagination is the limit when choosing where to host your nuptials. From bizarre underground ceremonies to screaming your vows on a rollercoaster in Las Vegas, destination weddings with a twist have become a trend for couples.

'There are so many unusual wedding locations around the world, it can be difficult to choose which type to go for,' explains MarryAbroad.co.uk co-founder Charlotte Hand. 

So if you're looking for a wedding with a twist, you may want to try some of these options... 

Get married in a gold mine, Nevada

Eldorado Ghost Town, otherwise known as  Nelson's Landing, is a deserted town in Nevada.

Here brides and grooms can marry in a real mine location, with a tour of the ghost town and its sparse, barren scenery, costing from $1,799 (£1,182).

 'Just one hour away from Vegas, this rustic town has an amazing array of old buildings, barns and props, like antique cars, rusted buses, gas pumps and even a crashed plane (as seen in the movie 3,000 Miles to Graceland),' says Joni Moss-Graham of The LV Wedding Connection.

Be a real life gold digger and marry above an original gold mine for a 'truly eclectic' ceremony

Or dig a little deeper and head underground for a ceremony inside the actual gold mine itself

'Ceremonies can take place inside the existing gold mine or outside surrounded by antiques and desert scenery. The location offers amazing photo opportunities with a 'built-in' vintage theme. It is truly for the eclectic.'

Spooky splicing in Niagara, Canada

Couples who love Halloween can opt for a one-of-a-kind experience, as they wed alongside guest of honour Jack Skellington - a character from the movie 'The Nightmare before Christmas'. 

The wedding officiant, also in a ghostly costume, pronounces the couple 'Ghouly-weds'. Packages cost from $295 (£195) with Elope Niagara.

Say 'I do' in a cave in Croatia

Deep down underground, beneath a hotel in Dubrovnik, marine-loving couples can join in matrimony in a cave with a glass floor overlooking the ocean. 

Significantly, the name of the resort is More, which translates to 'Hotel Sea'. Weddings cost from €5,300 (£3,980) with Yes I Du.

Be a bride in a balloon at Disney

Cartoon-fans can tie the knot in a hot air balloon at Walt Disney World in Florida. 

The 'Characters in Flight' package can include a ceremony 400ft in the air, inside one of the largest helium balloons in the world, with stunning views of all four Disney parks and the surrounding area. A ceremony costs from $1,500 (£985) with Elegant Weddings Orlando.

Nuptials on the New York New York coaster

Gazing up at the New York New York casino on the Las Vegas Strip from the street, passers-by cannot fail to notice the huge roller coaster, which zooms around the outside of the building at 67 miles per hour. 

Thrill-seekers can say 'I do' in a NYC taxi cab-themed carriage, as the coaster lifts them up 203 feet and down 144, with views of the glittering Vegas Strip. Weddings cost from $700 (£460) with The LV Wedding Connection.
