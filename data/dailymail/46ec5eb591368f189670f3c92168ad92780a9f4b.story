He was more than happy to discuss his collection of African art on the air.

But when it came to the allegations of sexual assault leveled against him, Bill Cosby went silent.

At the end of an interview with NPR on Saturday morning, the 77-year-old comedian was asked to respond to the resurgence of claims that he attacked multiple women years ago.

Sitting beside Cosby and his wife Camille, host Scott Simon said: 'This question gives me no pleasure Mr Cosby, but there have been serious allegations raised about you in recent days.

Silence: At the end of an interview with NPR on Saturday morning, Bill Cosby (pictured) was asked to respond to the resurgence of claims that he sexually assaulted several women years ago. Instead, he remained silent

Interview: Host Scott Simon, a father of two, later took to Twitter (pictured) to remark on his broaching of the allegations, which seemingly had not been agreed to as a potential topic of conversation prior to the interview

'I'm in the news business. I have to ask the question. Do you have any response to those charges?' 

While seconds earlier Cosby had been confidently chatting about the loan of his art for an exhibition in Washington D.C, he immediately stopped speaking.

Instead, he reportedly shook his head and refused to say another word.

Undeterred, Simon prodded: 'There are people who love you who might like to hear from you about this. I want to give you the chance.' But despite his efforts, Cosby stayed quiet.

SCOTT SIMON: 'This question gives me no pleasure Mr Cosby, but there have been serious allegations raised about you in recent days.'

BILL COSBY: [silence and shaking his head]

SIMON: 'You're shaking your head no. I'm in the news business. I have to ask the question. Do you have any response to those charges?'

COSBY: [silence and shaking his head]

SIMON: 'Shaking your head no. There are people who love you who might like to hear from you about this. I want to give you the chance.'

COSBY: [silence]

SIMON: 'Alright. Camille and Bill Cosby. They have lent 62 pieces from their collection of African and African American art to create an exhibit called Conversations: African and African American Artworks in Dialogue. It's now on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art through early 2016. Thank you both.' 

Cancelled: The  interview comes just a day after Cosby's scheduled appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman next week was cancelled. Above, Cosby's last appearance on the show  - January 13, 2014

Finally, the 62-year-old presenter concluded: 'Alright. Camille and Bill Cosby. They have lent 62 pieces from their collection of African and African American art to create an exhibit.

'Conversations: African and African American Artworks in Dialogue is now on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art through early 2016. Thank you both.'

Although Cosby remained silent, his wife could be heard saying 'Thank you' twice.  

Simon, a father of two, later took to Twitter to remark on his broaching of the allegations, which seemingly had not been agreed to as a potential topic of conversation prior to the interview.

Telling her story: Earlier this month, one of Cosby's alleged victims, Barbara Bowman (pictured, left and right), came forward and shared her story with MailOnline , claiming she was sexually assaulted by the star at 19

He tweeted: 'I'll respond to @BillCosby questions later. For moment: Yes, I hated having to ask about charges in front of Mrs Cosby.'

The Weekend Edition Saturday interview, later uploaded to CNN, comes just a day after Cosby's scheduled appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman next week was cancelled.

The cancellation meant the comedian has been dropped from a TV lineup twice in a month following his withdrawl from Queen Latifah's talk show in early November.

Decades-old accusations of rape came back to haunt Cosby last month after stand-up comedian and former Saturday Night Live writer Hannibal Buress unleashed a violent tirade about him.

During a live performance, Buress dubbed Cosby a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite. A video of the rant quickly spread online, reigniting a fire that has long burned.

It also inspired one alleged victim, Barbara Bowman, to come forward and share her story with MailOnline, claiming she was sexually assaulted by Cosby when she was aged 19. 

On Friday, a spokesman for The Late Show confirmed to Newsday that Cosby's guest booking for next Wednesday had been cancelled. It unclear whether it was Cosby or Letterman  that pulled out.

Meanwhile, a representative for Queen Latifah's talk show reported that it was Cosby who withdrew from his spot on October 31.

Allegations of rape were first leveled against Cosby in 2005 in a lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee.

The 32-year-old claimed she had been sexually assaulted in the star's Philadelphia mansion in 2004, adding that her suit also contained the testimonies of 13 other women with similar claims.

The suit was settled in 2006 for an undisclosed amount. Bowman has now come forward identifying herself as one of those 13 women.

Speaking to MailOnline, Bowman alleged: 'I was drugged and raped by that man. He is a monster. He came at me like a monster.

'My hope is that others who have experienced sexual abuse will not be intimidated into silence by the famous, rich and powerful. If I can help one victim, then I've done my job.'

Backfire: On Monday, Cosby invited fans to create memes using a selection of photos of him. However, the idea majorly backfired - his Twitter feed was inundated with memes that referenced the rape claims (pictured)

Bowman was just a teenager at the time she met Cosby, and soon the actor was flying her to meet him around the country and putting her up in the nicest hotels, it is alleged.

Things changed, however, when one night she reportedly passed out after a glass of wine and woke up vomiting in the toilet wearing Cosby's white t-shirt.

Bowman is certain that she was drugged by Cosby. And she believes she was raped by him too.

After that her relationship with Cosby changed, and by 19 he had sent her on her way after a final night in Atlantic City, where she claims he tried to rape her.

Cosby has not commented on the allegations and has never been charged with sexual assault.

He has been married to Camille for 50 years and has five children.

On Monday,  in an apparent attempt to connect with his Twitter followers, Cosby invited fans to create memes using a selection of photos of him. However, the idea majorly backfired.

Instead, the comedian's Twitter feed was inundated with memes that referenced the rape claims.

Shortly after, Cosby's original tweet was deleted and the meme generator was removed from the site.
