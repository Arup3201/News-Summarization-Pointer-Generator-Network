The crew of a British ferry which crashed into a fishing boat while they were 'chatting about Halle Berry' have been found guilty of manslaughter in France.

Tapes from the bridge of the catamaran Condor Vitesse revealed Captain Paul Le Romancer and first mate Yves Tournon were discussing the actress's 'sexy outfit' in Catwoman when their 285-ft vessel ploughed in the French trawler in thick fog.

The 45mph collision split the 30-ft fishing boat Les Marquises in half, killing captain Philippe Lesaulnier, a 42-year-old father of four. The boat's two other crew members were fished out of the sea unharmed.

Sentenced: French crew Paul Le Romancer (L), 58, and his first mate Yves Tournon, 48, were handed suspended sentences and fines after the ferry they were commanding collided with a fishing vessel killing its captain

Distracted: The trial heard how the two Frenchmen were talking about Halle Berry in a 'sexy outfit' as Catwoman, and drug testing as they travelled at 45mph in fog with 200 passengers on board

Le Romancer, 59, was handed an 18-month suspended sentence and first mate Tournon, 48, a 12-month suspended sentence by a court in the Normandy town of Coutances on Wednesday.

The trial heard that an investigation by France's BEA maritime authority found the pair had been having an 'almost-continuous conversations unconnected with the operations of the vessel'.

At the time of the collision, there were 200 passengers on board the vessel owned by Britain's Condor Ferries, which was crossing from the French port of St Malo to Jersey on the night of March 28, 2011.

A recording of the conversation on the bridge moments before the disaster reveals Le Romancer saying of the 2004 film: 'Last night I watched Catwoman on television. I'm an idiot because after that I didn't sleep well.

Tournon replied: 'Catwoman?'

British company Condor Ferries was not prosecuted after the collision in which one of its ferries sliced through a fishing boat killing its captain

The trial heard how Captain Lesaulnier was killed; two other fishermen were rescued form the water and survived

The captain answers: 'She was jumping everywhere like a cat. She's bloody beautiful. She was wearing a sexy outfit.'

The conversation later turned to how long certain drugs would remain present in the body and jokes about the first mate forgetting his glasses, before an alarm indicated the collision.

The BEA accident report noted: 'There was an an atmosphere that was hardly compatible with the concentration needed to pilot a high-speed vessel in foggy conditions.'

The pair had also not been paying enough attention to their radar in the fog, and had deactivated the ship's anti-collision system and had not turned on its fog horn, the court was told.

After the verdict, the victim's widow Delphine Lesaulnier said the court's decision was 'unacceptable'.

She said outside court: 'This is ridiculous, it's nothing at all. It's like you can kill someone, destroy a family and nothing happens.'

Le Romancer and Tournon were also ordered to jointly pay £6,800 in damages to the fishing boat captain's widow, £2,550 to each of his children and £1,700 to each of the other two surviving fishermen who had been on the boat at the time of the crash.

Condor Ferries, based on the British island of Guernsey, was not prosecuted over the collision.

Philippe Lesaulnier's widow reacted with fury to their lenient sentences.  

‘It’s nothing at all,’ said Delphine Lesaulnier, the mother of Mr Lesaulnier’s four children. ‘It’s like you can kill someone, destroy a family and nothing happens.’

Condor Ferries, based on the British island of Guernsey, did not face prosecution.
