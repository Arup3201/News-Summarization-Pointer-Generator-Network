Two people have been confirmed dead and two are missing after a Lear jet crashed shortly after takeoff Tuesday night just off the Florida coast.

Officials are searching for two additional people aboard the Cozumel, Mexico-bound medical flight still unaccounted for after the jet went down east of Fort Lauderdale just before 8.00pm.

Footage from NBC Miami showed two bodies being taken back to shore and being offloaded to land just after 9.00pm local time.

The Mexican-registered jet took off from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport carrying two pilots, a doctor and a nurse, the Coast Guard said. 

The plane crashed into the sea after reporting mechanical problems, reported NBC Miami.

Emergency personnel arrived on the scene to see a large debris field and two bodies – a male and a female – which were immediately recovered. It is not yet clear who was pulled from the ocean.

The crashed jet is often used as an air ambulance, sources at the airport told Local 10.

It had flown from Costa Rica to Miami earlier in the day and was headed to Cozumel after a short layover, the station added.

Pictures released by the Coast Guard show the shocking damage to the plane as pieces of the wreckage are hauled onto salvage ships.

Four Coast Guard boats and a helicopter in the search, rescue and recovery effort are joined by three Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission search and rescue crews, as well as a Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue boatcrew, officials said.

‘The men and women out there from all of the responding agencies are doing their best to try and find any survivors in the water,’ a Coast Guard spokesperson said during a media briefing.

Lights from the rescue effort are clearly visible from land in local media footage.

Two dead: Two are confirmed dead, officials are still searching for the other two passengers

One person who was on the beach when the plane went down told WPLG that he thought it ‘was really strange for a plane to be flying so low.’

‘Then a couple, maybe 30 minutes later, there’s the Coast Guard, as you can see down there,’ Daniel Figueroa added.

Officials have vowed to continue searching throughout the night for the other two people aboard the flight.
