A thrifty gardener is still using the same tools his grandfather first used 130 years ago.

Neville Hume inherited the utensils in 1979 from his late father Alfred who had been given them by his own father, and has been using them ever since.

The former hairdresser from Sutton Coldfield, Warks, claims they are more reliable than tools in shops today.

Mr Hume has been using his grandfather's tools since 1979 and claims they are more reliable than those in shops today

Despite being over 130 years old, the Victorian weeding hoe and digging fork are in surprisingly good condition.

The handles of both tools are made from elm wood, with their steel ends remaining in almost pristine condition.

The four prongs on the fork have been worn down slightly and are now only four inches long, about half their original length.

But Mr Hume insists he wouldn't be caught in his garden without them.

He said: 'My grandfather was a professional gardener for a wealthy landowner and his boss bought the tools for him.

'I guess they built things to last in those days.

'My father was given them and he worked as a chauffeur and gardener and so used them professionally as well.

'When he retired he even took them to his retirement home and used them right up until he died in 1979

'I have had them since then and use them all the time in my garden and allotment. They are perfect for tidying up a flower border.

'I always keep them clean and wipe them off after I use them.

'I've had lots of other forks over the years but the tines of those end up bending out of shape and they don't last.'

Mr Hume who lives with his wife, Amanda, does not have any sons of his own to pass the tools on to.

'If and when it gets to the point where I can't manage the garden anymore I will probably donate them to a museum,' he said.
