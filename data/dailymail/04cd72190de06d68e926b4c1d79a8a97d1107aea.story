What is essentially a glorified sock has helped boost the net income of the world’s largest athletic clothing company by nearly 40per cent.

Nike’s Flyknit sneaker, which uses knitted fibers to create a lightweight, durable, and incredibly attractive shoe, is one of the main contributors to the brand’s steady sales increases and progress on the stock market, Bloomberg says.

At $160, the Eco-conscious shoe is among one of Nike’s most expensive product offerings in the women’s footwear category.

Thread technology: Flyknits use durable woven threads to create a sock-like experience

The Flyknit’s success represents Nike’s push towards higher-priced shoes, which financial analysts have labeled as an equally successful plot.

Additional styles like the woven Inneva ($200) sneaker have helped raise the brand’s aesthetic profile even further.

But those designs have not registered the same kind of fanfare as the coveted Flyknit- which is now offered in a large variety of colorways. 

Nike has even adapted Flyknit technology for its sturdier Flyknit Lunar running shoe, and has used Flyknit threads in a winterized sneaker that will be worn by medal-winning U.S. Olympians on the podium in Sochi.

In the athletics division, Nike’s $225 Hypervenom soccer cleats have proven an equal success to the Flyknit's street appeal, Bloomberg says.

Decreased raw material costs have helped widen the brand’s profit margins on the already higher-priced merchandise.

Jay Sole, an analyst for Morgan Stanley,
 told Bloomberg that ‘the growing global health and wellness trend plus 
strong product innovations are driving Nike’s business.’

The shoe's one-piece upper portion is constructed of polyester fibers that are woven more tightly in areas of the foot that require additional support.

Research for the Flyknit sneaker began in 2002 when Nike product developers realized that athletes at Stanford University were training barefoot.

Nike says that the result is a 
lightweight, 'second-skin' experience that creates little-to-none 
environmental waste in its production thanks to its specially-designed 
knitting machines.

Cowen & Co. analyst Faye Landes, chimed in on Nike for MarketWatch saying
 that ‘Nike’s cool factor is highest among adults 18-24, and 
significantly higher among non-whites than whites, both boding extremely
 well for Nike long-term.’ [sic]

The brand reported last week that its quarterly sales had increased by 8per cent to $6.43 billion.

Nike stocks recently hit an all-time high of $80 per share – though some analysts appear skeptical of the brand’s capability for further market growth.

Nike representatives have attributed the label’s rising success to not only more expensive goods, but its growing foothold in e-commerce as well.

Nike’s online sales have risen 33per cent in the last year, they say, and represent at least 15per cent of the company’s overall revenue.

For this reason, Nike has rejigged its line of Internet-reliant ‘Fuelbands,’ with a more modern appearance.

The brand plans to launch additional 
e-commerce sites this year in Brazil and Japan – the latter of which is 
the third largest online shopping economy in the world.

Nike
 is anticipating a banner year in 2014 with its sponsorship of three 
major flagship events: The Sochi Olympics, The World Cup, and The 
Superbowl among them.

The brand has created specialty product lines and athletic apparel for each event, and says that its wholesale orders reflect an excitement surrounding this year's spread of games.

Analysts say that Nike’s overhead costs to promote the events, though, will likely overshadow sales increases created by the limited-edition goods.

As Ms Landes said: ‘Despite its terrific top line track record in recent years, Nike still has many opportunities to grow its top line.’
