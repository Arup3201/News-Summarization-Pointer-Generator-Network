Standard Liege's Belgian Pro League match against Zulte Waregem was abandoned in the 90th minute after furious fans broke fences and threw seats onto the pitch.

Trouble flared after Theo Bongonda opened the scoring for lowly Zulte Waregem, who sit bottom of the league after six losses from their first ten games.

Liege fans have become frustrated with their side's poor start to the season, and began to throw seats and break fences just metres from the pitch.

The referee was forced to stop play twice, the latter of which just seconds before the end of the match.

With the score at 2-1, the referee made the decision to abandon proceedings, taking both sets of players off the field.
