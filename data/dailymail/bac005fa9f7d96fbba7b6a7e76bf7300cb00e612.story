The truth is that Roy Hodgson and I never clicked because I was far too outgoing for his liking and I had to rein that in when I was in front of him.

On the pitch, there were no problems as I gave my all for him, as I would have done for any manager. We just never had that special relationship.

He never really opened up to me, but he’s not that type of manager. He was far more like a schoolteacher-style gaffer you couldn’t get close to.

The man and the boss: Bullard played under Hodgson at Fulham between 2007 and 2009

Tenure: Roy Hodgson enjoyed a successful stint at Craven Cottage with Fulham before going to Liverpool

The English Capello, if you like. It was the start of the 2008-09 season and my form for Fulham going  back to the start of the year had been recognised by England.

It was definitely the pinnacle of my career, which is why I would never have believed anyone who would have told me I’d be a Hull player by January.

But this is football and anything can happen, on and off the pitch. Things like the future manager of England playing golf instead of turning up to a meeting with me to discuss the possible extension of my contract.

Having suffered a horrible knee injury,  I was worried that the 16 months left on my Fulham deal would not cover me sufficiently if it should happen again.

So I asked the club if they would consider giving me a new, longer deal to make me feel more secure. I was playing well so I really didn’t envisage any stumbling blocks.

A meeting was set up between me, my agent Andy Evans, Hodgson and the Fulham chief executive Alistair Mackintosh.

Andy and I met up with the chief exec, but there was no sign of Roy. Alistair was a bit confused by that and called him, only to find out he was playing golf and wouldn’t be coming. That was the end of that meeting.

I thought it was bang out of order. It doesn’t matter if you’re the chairman, owner or manager, you have to treat people with respect and that’s pretty much what I told Roy the next time I saw him.

I asked him where he’d been when we were supposed to have had a meeting and  I told him it showed me and my agent a  lack of respect. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been so hostile, but his decision not to attend that meeting spoke volumes.

The bloke was immaculate. His kit was tight and fitted him perfectly.

Paolo di Canio became West Ham club captain and his skipper’s armband had claret and blue tassles hanging off it, making him look like a warrior.

Socks rolled up perfectly over his permanently shaved, well-oiled legs, he oozed Italian class and style.

He was a real man. And he was also an utterly terrifying nutcase.

Pinpoint precision: Bullard was called up on three occasions following his displays for Fulham

Bullard thought it was 'out of order' that Hodgson missed his meeting about a new contract when he had been out with a knee injury
