A pensioner and his wife were both caught drink driving at the same time after he drove to her aid after she was involved in a minor car crash, a court heard.

Charles Fitch, 75, got behind the wheel while over the limit after police phoned him and said his wife Kathryn Mason had been in a crash.

As he made his way to the scene, officers breathalysed Mrs Mason and found she was twice the drink-drive limit after an evening at the social club.

When Mr Fitch arrived police smelt alcohol on his breath - and they discovered he was also nearly twice the limit. The pensioner admitted he had drunk 'a couple of whiskies' at home that evening.

They were both arrested and taken to the same police station.

The couple appeared at the same magistrates’ court on the same day and both pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol.

Mr Fitch, a retired director of an aerospace engineering company, was banned from driving for 12 months and his wife was disqualified for 17 months.

The couple live in a £350,000 thatched cottage in Poulner, near Ringwood, Hampshire.

After the case Mrs Mason, 59, said: 'I was in the car and I can’t really remember what happened but I had a blow-out or something like that.

'Charles got a crackly phone call saying I had been in an accident and he got in his car.

'I’m sure if he had stopped to think for a moment as he had had a few drinks he wouldn’t have done it.

'But if I was able to make a phone call perhaps it wouldn’t have happened. Thankfully there wasn’t anybody else involved in the accident.'

Magistrates in Bournemouth heard that Mrs Mason had spent the evening of December 14 last year at a social club.

She got into her black Peugeot 207 to drive home but crashed in West Moors, Dorset, at about 9pm.

Mr Fitch went to look for her ‘slowly and carefully’ in his Vauxhall Astra but was breathalysed by police when he found the scene.

Mr Fitch’s breath test had a reading of 62 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35mg.

His wife had a reading of 74mg which is just over twice the legal limit.

He was fined £400 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £40 victim surcharge.

Mrs Mason was fined £350 pounds and told to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £35.

The couple were arrested as part of a pre-Christmas crackdown on drink drivers by Dorset Police.
