Rising costs: Britain's top five supermarkets have increased the price of budget egg lines by an average of 40 per cent in the last year

Egg prices have risen by 40 per cent over the past year, making it increasingly difficult for cash-strapped shoppers to purchase cheaper sources of protein.

Rising input costs have resulted in supermarkets hiking the price of budget own-brand egg lines, traditionally one of the cheapest family foods.

All of the UK's 'big four' supermarket chains were selling six-packs of eggs for below £1 last year.

But Asda and Morrisons are now the 
only supermarkets selling eggs for less than £1, but even their products
 have been subject to huge price increases.

A pack of six Asda Smart Price eggs 
from caged hens now costs 98p, up from 69p last year, according to a report in consumer magazine The Grocer.

Six 
Morrisons M Savers eggs cost 99p, up from 65p at the start of 2012.

Sainsbury's is offering a pack of six 
Basics own-label Freedom Foods-endorsed barn eggs for £1, compared with 
79p last year.

Tesco is selling its cheapest pack of six eggs for 
£1.09, also up from 79p.

Hike: The rising prices have been blamed on increased production costs and EU rules on battery cages

While price rises have been most dramatic on budget eggs, more expensive lines have also been hit.

Out of around 130 comparable hen egg lines at the top five supermarkets, 68.7 per cent are now more expensive than last year, 16 per cent are the same and just 15.3 per cent cheaper.

Sainsbury's                £0.79         £1.00

Tesco                          £0.79         £1.09

Morrisons                  £0.65         £0.99

Asda                           £0.69          £0.9

The retailers say that higher input 
costs have pushed up prices. 

A spokesman for Tesco told the magazine: 'Factors such as the rising commodity costs of wheat and soya mean that 
some products, including eggs, have increased in price slightly over the
 past year.'

This view was echoed by Sainsbury's, as a spokesman said: 'Increasing wheat and soya prices mean that, 
in common with other retailers, we have had to increase the price of 
some of our eggs.'

Morrisons added that new EU rules on battery cages, which came into force in January 2012, had also pushed up prices.
