Edible: The Survival Senbei iPhone 5 case is 
handmade from Japanese brown rice and salt, and is available online for 
just £30 plus shipping

The iPhone fan scene across the planet has proved a ready and willing market for entrepreneurs marketing a range of accessories.

This may be the most idiosyncratic yet, however. One enterprising Japanese businesswoman has created an iPhone 5 case that you can eat.

Made entirely from Japanese brown rice and salt, the Survival Senbei iPhone 5 case is intended not so much to protect your phone, but to keep you going in the event of a large-scale natural disaster.

The entrepreneur behind the Survival Senbei is a middle-aged master senbei artisan called Mariko.

Senbei, traditional rice crackers, are the snack of choice for older Japanese, and Mariko came up with the senbei smartphone case as a way to broaden its appeal to the younger generation.

The cases are available to buy online at a cost of ¥3,818 (which, RocketNews24 reports, is a Japanese mnemonic pun on the word 'survival'). That works out to around £30, plus shipping.

Depending on demand, delivery can take up to a month because, Mariko explains, 'I can make about three good ones a day.'

It won't protect your phone, but it could save your life: The Senbei Survival iPhone case is intended to be eaten in an emergency, such as during a large scale natural disaster

However, before you reach for your credit card, Mariko warns customers that the case is immensely fragile and she cannot guarantee the case will reach them in one piece.

'I can make about three good ones a day': Mariko in her bakery. She says to allow up to a month for delivery of the iPhone case, depending on demand

Indeed, she outlines the likelihood of the case breaking in a number of situations:

Despite its frailty, English-language suppliers report they have sold out of the Survival Senbai cracker.

If you want to get your hands on one, grab an English-Japanese dictionary and head to Mariko's online shop.
