Shocking new footage taken moments after doomed Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was downed in Ukraine shows the jet was just yards from hitting a village.

The video, which comes four months after the passenger plane was shot down over rebel-held eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people, shows panicked villagers running to and from the blaze with buckets of water.

Others stand and watch in shock as plumes of smoke rise into the sky, with no sign of life among the wreckage.

New footage: Shocking amateur video shows Ukrainian villagers running towards MH17's crash site moments after it was shot down

The Malaysian Airlines flight was just yards from crashing into houses in the village of Hrabove

The amateur footage, filmed by a resident of the Ukrainian village of Hrabove, shows people reacting in alarm as the wreckage burns just yards away from their homes on the afternoon of July 17.

Villagers rush towards the fire but quickly realise there is little chance that anybody on board will have survived.

The video, thought to be the first taken after the tragedy, appears to suggest that residents first assumed it was a Ukrainian military plane that had been shot down.

Before long, the shocked crowd of villagers start to question whether more than one aircraft had been shot down because of the sheer amount of debris.

One man is heard asking if there was a second plane, but a witness tells him that only one aircraft was seen plummeting from the sky. 

One bystander is heard asking: 'And where is the pilot?'

Another answers: 'Who the hell knows?'

As the mobile phone camera pans across the scene, it becomes evident that just a single-track lane separates the crash site from a house on the outskirts of Hrabove.

The village's residents are likely to have been asking for the whereabouts of the pilot as, before MH17 was shot down, rebels would often capture pilots after shooting down military planes and hold them prisoner.

Three days before the passenger jet crashed, rebels claimed responsibility for shooting down an Antonov-24 military transport plane. A day later, the pilot was questioned on Russian television. 

Recovery work begun at the wreckage site of Malaysian Airways flight MH17 earlier today.

The Dutch Safety Board (DSB), which is leading the investigation into the tragedy - which cost the lives of 298 people including 10 Britons - has up to now had limited access to the crash site.

But the board announced a few days ago that it hoped to start the recovery soon and today announced work had begun.

The investigation team said wreckage would be collected over several days before being taken to the Ukrainian government-controlled city of Kharkiv and then flown to the Netherlands.

Human remains and personal belongings were recovered throughout the day, but efforts were hampered by mortar landing less than a mile from the crash site.

Passports and bank cards were handed to the investigators by locals.  

The investigation team said the wreckage would be collected over several days before being transported to the Ukrainian government-controlled city of Kharkiv and then flown to the Netherlands. 

The plane was on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when the crash happened on July 17 this year in an area where pro-Russian separatists operated. 

Kiev accuses pro-Russian separatists of shooting down the plane with an anti-aircraft missile. Russia says a Ukrainian military aircraft shot down MH17. 

The tragedy came months after the mysterious disappearance of another Malaysian Airlines plane - MH370.

The flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing vanished from radar in March with 239 people on board and no trace of the aircraft has been found.
