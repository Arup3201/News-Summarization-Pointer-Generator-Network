Thirty four Greenpeace activists were under arrest in France today after breaking into the country's oldest nuclear power plant to demand that it is closed.

Up to 90 protestors stormed the Fessenheim installation, in the east of the country close to the city of Mulhouse and the Swiss border. They hung anti-nuclear banners from a dome of the plant with one reading: ‘Stop risking Europe’.

Hundreds of riot police arrived at the site following the start of the protest, at around 5.30am, and arrests were made later in the morning. Fessenheim, which is considered unsafe by many, is run by energy giants EDF, which is set to build two reactors in Britain.

A spokesman for the company said: ‘Gendarmes have 56 activists under control and 34 have been arrested. There has been no impact on the security of the plant, which continues to function normally.’

President Francois Hollande has pledged to close Fessenheim by 2016, but Greenpeace wants its two 37 year old reactors to be shut now. France currently relies on nuclear power to produce 75 per cent of its electricity, but Mr Hollande has pledged to cut this figure to 50 percent.

There have been ongoing concerns about the seismic safety of plants, especially since the nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011.

Catastrophic failure at the Japanese plant resulted in a meltdown of three of its six nuclear reactors, causing injuries to workers and creating huge health fears among people living nearby.

The environmental organization says it wants to draw attention to the 'danger of aging nuclear power plants in Europe'

A Greenpeace spokesman called for ‘plant closures across Europe’ to limit the dangers to public safety, and the huge cost associated with running the plants.

Greenpeace activists regularly break into nuclear plants so as to highlight their concerns about them. Around 30 were arrested last July after getting into EDF’s Tricastin plant in the south of France.

EDF plans to start operating the first new nuclear reactor at the Hinkley Point C site in England in 2023.

Britain is counting on the construction of new nuclear plants to replace ageing and polluting power stations that are closing down over the coming years.

Alexandra Harris from Britain, was one of 30 Greenpeace activists who were detained for two months after being arrested in the Arctic sea

The 34 Greenpeace activists arrested in France can expect a far less harrowing experience than their colleagues who were arrested by Russian troops in the Arctic Sea and sent to a rat-infested soviet-era prison.

The group of 25 protesters, including six UK nationals, were held on board their ship the Arctic Sunrise following a protest against a Russian oil rig drilling in pristine Arctic waters.

A team of heavily-armed Russian special forces soldiers abseiled onto the deck from a helicopter quickly taking over the ship.

The environmentalists were forced to kneel with their hands on their heads as the soldiers pointed their weapons at them.

The group were taken to the a prison in Murmansk, revealed to be infested with rats, where they were denied the right to call home or receive letters.

Dutch female activist Faiza Oulahsen revealed in a letter that she was being held in 'in a dirty cell, alone, isolated from the rest'.

She wrote: 'Once in a while a rat crawls across the floor. I've lost weight and am not sleeping too well, but I am still holding my head high.'

British activist Alex Harris revealed that she tapped out messages to fellow inmates on radiator pipes in order to stay sane as she was forced to spend 23 hours a day alone in her cell.

The group were charged with piracy and told they faced up to 15 years in prison, but the cahrges were later reduced to hooliganism.

Eleven Nobel Peace Prize laureates wrote to Russian president Vladimir Putin calling for the original piracy charges to be dropped.

Greenpeace said the 30 had done nothing wrong, and the group has launched a worldwide campaign to have them freed.

They were held for two months before the charges were dropped and they were allowed to return home.

Greenpeace has warned a spill in Arctic waters would be highly damaging to the environment and the extraction of more fossil fuels would add to climate change impacts.
