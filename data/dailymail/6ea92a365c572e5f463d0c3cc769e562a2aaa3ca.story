One of the principal figures in New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's 'Bridgegate' scandal is willing to tell what he knows in exchange for immunity from prosecution, it was revealed today.

David Wildstein, the Port Authority official who allegedly spearheaded politically motivated traffic 
jams on the George Washington Bridge that backed up morning commuters on four days in September, said through his lawyer that he will testify only when he no longer faces the possibility of criminal charges.

His lawyer, Alan Zegas, told The 
Associated Press on Friday that 'if he 
has immunity from the relevant entities, he'll talk.'

David Wildstein, the former NY/NJ Port Authority official at the center of the bridge flap, refused to answer questions during a Jan. 9 hearing in Trenton, but the state legislature's new investigative committee has issued a fresh subpoena to keep him on the hot seat

John Wisniewski brought 18 names and 2 organizations to his bipartisan Special Committee on Investigations on Thursday, and all 20 subpoenas were approved in under two hours

Morning mess: Toll lanes on the George Washington Bridge, America's busiest span, were closed to local traffic in September for nearly a whole work week, causing delays for commuters, school buses and emergency responders

The New Jersey General Assembly's 
transportation committee, chaired by the hard-charging John Wisniewski, 
subpoenaed records and testimony from Wildstein in December.

The 
hundreds of pages of emails and text messages he turned over included 
what some in the state capitol are calling a 'smoking gun' message.

In
 it, former deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly – publicly fired last 
week by Gov. Christie – wrote Wildstein that it was 'time for some 
traffic problems in Fort Lee,' a New Jersey town where morning commuters
 enter the busy George Washington Bridge.

'Got it,' replied Wildstein in the email.

The result was a four-day rearrangement of traffic cones on the bridge's entry tollgates, choking off the flow of cars from Fort Lee and bringing the town to a standstill for hours on end.

Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich declined to endorse Christie when he ran for re-election last year, and some observers believe the traffic jam was political payback.

Zegas said the U.S. Attorney's office – which Christie ran before he became governor – has not stepped forward to offer him immunity.

A host of current and former Christie aides and appointees were served subpoenas Thursday night and Friday morning.

The unlucky list includes his chief counsel Charlie McKenna, former deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly, former political campaign manager Bill Stepien, chief of staff Kevin O'Dowd – who Christie has nominated to be his state's attorney general – and his planned replacement Regina Egea, plus the governor's cantankerous longtime spokesman Michael Drewniak, and Drewniak's wife Nicole.

Others who figure in Thursday's legal bloodbath are current and past officials inside the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the government behemoth that operates airports, bridges, tunnels, train and bus depots, and maritime ports throughout the nation's largest metropolitan region.

Port Authority executive director Patrick Foye and chairman David Samson join Wildstein and former Foye deputy Bill Baroni, both Christie appointees.

The avalanche of legal paper will follow 17 people in all, plus three New Jersey organizations that will come under the gaze of a bipartisan New Jersey legislative 'super investigative committee.'

The 'Christie for Governor' political campaign organization is named in one subpoena, according to a source with knowledge of the documents crisscrossing the capitol building in Trenton.

Christie himself is not among those personally targeted for document production or demands for testimony.

'There's no intention right now to subpoena the governor,' Select Committee on Investigation chairman John Wisniewski said Thursday after the panel's first meeting.

'We've seen nothing in the documents that has – you know – an email from the governor, or to the governor. We've not seen any kind of direct link.'

Christie said Tuesday during his annual State of the State address that his administration would 'cooperate with all appropriate investigations,'

Business as usual: Christie spoke to media and homeowners about the ongoing recovery from Hurricane Sandy in the town of Manahawkin on Thursday

Bill Baroni Jr. – Former deputy executive director of the NY/NJ Port Authority, appointed by Christie in 2010 and resigned in December 2013

Maria Comella – Deputy chief of staff for communications and planning

Michael Drewniak – Christie's longtime press secretary who also served as his chief public affairs officer for six years in the U.S. Attorney's office

Nicole Davidman Drewniak – Christie's campaign finance director, married to Michael Drewniak since October 2012

Regina Egea – Director of the governor's Authorities Unit, which oversees the Port Authority, and slated to become chief of staff after O'Dowd's departure

Patrick Foye – Executive director of the Port Authority, appointed by NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2011

Bridget Anne Kelly – Christie's former deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs, fired on Jan. 8

Charlie McKenna – Chief counselor to the governor, the lawyer tasked with managing the legal end of government policy on a day-to-day basis

Matt Mowers – The Christie political operative who unsuccessfully sought a campaign endorsement from Fort Lee, N.J mayor Mark Sokolich

Kevin O’Dowd – Christie's chief of staff and nominee to become attorney generalColin Reed – Christie's deputy communications director

David Samson – Chairman of the Port Authority Board of Commissioners since early 2011, appointed by Christie following work as his campaign counsel

Bill Stepien – Christie campaign chief in both 2009 and 2013, lost consulting contract with the Christie-led Republican Governors Association on Jan. 8, along with a chance to chair the NJ Republican Party

David Wildstein – Former director of interstate and capital projects at the Port Authority, a position Christie reportedly created for him. He resigned in December

He
publicly announced a week ago that he had fired Kelly after he learned of her links to the bridge lane closures.

The governor had softer words about Stepien, his former campaign manager, announcing only that he had lost a consulting contract with the Christie-led Republican Governors Association, and would not be permitted to run for the chairmanship of the state Republican party.

O'Dowd, McKenna and Drewniak, however, are closer to Gov. Christie.

Drewniak has served as his chief media relations man since his days as U.S. Attorney in the Garden State.

McKenna, too, served in the U.S. Attorney's office as Christie's top senior prosecutor, and later joined his administration as director of the state's homeland security agency.

But O'Dowd, said a Democratic assembly staffer, 'is the biggest slam-dunk of them all for the Democrats.'

As Kelly's direct supervisor, the aide told MailOnline, O'Dowd is presumed to have known 'anything Christie knew about the whole bridge plot.'

'And if Bridget Kelly was following the governor's orders, there's no way O'Dowd wasn't the middle-man,' he said.

News of Drewniak's subpoena was met by
 knowing grins among New Jersey journalists who have come to know him as
 a coarse, salty, and often vulgar gatekeeper to Christie.

'The
 chickens are coming home to roost,' one such veteran reporter confided 
in MailOnline, saying Drewniak is known for his 'vicious temper and a 
vindictive nature that belongs in the Sopranos.'

In one email revealed last week, sent 
to David Wildstein from his personal account, Drewniak referred to a 
Newark Star-Ledger reporter as 'such a f***ing mutt.' In another, 
referring to the Star-Ledger journalist's request for a meeting between 
the governor and their editorial board, Drewniak wrote WIldstein, 'F*** 
him and the S-L.'

Drewniak is unique among the committee's investigative targets, in that his wife, Nicole Davidman Drewniak, also appears on the
subpoena list.

Mrs. Drewniak was Christie's campaign finance 
director during his 2013 re-election bid.

Wildstein's messages suggest that he was at the center of an effort to cover up the impact of the bridge lane closures, and to hide the reasons for the stunt.

Among the small batch of emails and 
text messages that the Bergen County Record was first to publish on Jan.
 8 was an exchange between Wildstein and Bill Baroni, then both Port Authority
 officials, after Baroni's contentious Nov. 25 testimony before 
Wisniewski's transportation committee.

In the back-and-forth, Baroni asks Wildstein for 'Trenton feedback,' likely referring to the governor's office.

'Good,' responds Wildstein.

'Just good? S**t,' Baroni curses back.

'No,'
 WIldstein assures him in reply, 'I have only texted Brudget [Bridget 
Kelly] and Nicole[,] they were VERY happy ... Both said you did great.'

Gov.
 Christie has forcefully denied having any knowledge of the bridge 
traffic scheme, or playing any role in directing it. His unequivocal 
statements have set up a political scenario where a single email, text 
message or statement to the contrary could sink his chances of winning 
the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.
