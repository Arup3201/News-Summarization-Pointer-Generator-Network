An adorable 999 recording has revealed the moment a five-year-old boy is told police are on the way to rescue his mother and sister after they became trapped in a bedroom.

Jacob Rees remained the coolest head in the house after his sister Lauren, seven, accidentally locked mother Rachel Clarke into a room with a broken lock during a game of hide and seek.

With no mobile phone or way of escaping, Ms Clarke panicked - as Jacob and his two-year-old brother James were alone in the family's house in Bristol.

SCROLL DOWN TO LISTEN

Reunited: Jacob Rees, five, with his mother Rachel, sister Lauren, seven and brother James, two

But after shouting under the door and sliding notes to Jacob, the schoolboy followed her instructions to use the phone to try and call Ms Clarke's partner Stephen and family friends.

When no one answered she told him to dial 999 in exasperation.

After calmly explaining the situation, an operator told Jacob someone was on the way to help.

The ecstatic youngster was so happy he shouted through the door: 'I did it mummy, they are coming right now!'

Police soon arrived and managed to free Ms Clarke and Lauren.

Hairdresser Rachel, 41, said: 'I am so proud of Jacob. He was
brilliant and stayed so calm. At one point he even said to me - 'mummy,
is this going to take much longer? I'm getting bored now.'

'If it hadn't been for him we would have been stuck in there until my partner Stephen got home at 5.30pm.'

The children were treated with a trip to the cinema and a meal out while Jacob was also praised by the police for his actions.

Proud: Jacob Rees remained cool and calm as he dialled 999 and explained to the operator how his mother was trapped in a bedroom

MS Clarke said: 'My mind was racing and worried because there were knives in drawers and nobody was supervising them.

'I didn't have my mobile phone with 
me, and didn't know what to do. I started to slide paper under the door with numbers for Jacob to go and try on the phone.

'He has never had to use a phone before but he managed to phone my partner but the he had no reception.

'I thought about getting Jacob to go next door but I was worried what might happen to him.

'I tried to get him to phone a few more family members but he wasn't having any luck so as a last resort I got him to phone 999.

'I must have been in there for about an hour. When officers finally got to me they just found me in tears.

PC Matthew Hearn, who rescued Rachel, said: 'When we initially arrived we spoke with Jacob through the front door, he was calm and informed us to use the back door, he then unlocked the back door to allow us entry and showed us to the upstairs bedroom.

'The internal door was solid wood and the door handles were not present, it was clear that the mother was extremely distressed about the safety of her three young children, so I forced entry to the room.

'After releasing the very relieved mother we spent some time with the family commending Jacob's actions.'

Police: Hello, you are through to the police.Jacob: Hello.P: Is your mummy there?J: Yes, she is trapped in her bedroom. Me and my brother are upstairs. My brother is playing and my sister is trapped in the bedroom as well.P: How are they trapped?

Mum I'm talking to someone - ok?P: Stay on the phone Jacob because I'm going to get someone to come and help you.J: Ok.P: Did your mummy tell you to phone the police Jacob?J: Yes.P: That was good.
