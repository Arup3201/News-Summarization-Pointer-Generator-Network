Under investigation: The FBI is probing possible criminal violations by Rupert Murdoch's staff

Rupert Murdoch's media empire is today under a stepped-up U.S. investigation and FBI inquiry into possible violations by employees of a U.S. law banning corrupt payments to foreign officials.

But U.S. investigators have found little to substantiate allegations of phone hacking inside the country by the media mogul’s journalists, law enforcement and corporate sources said.

The FBI is probing possible criminal violations by Mr Murdoch’s staff of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a law intended to curb payment of bribes by U.S. companies to foreign officials.

If any action was pursued by U.S. 
authorities against Murdoch employees, it would most likely relate to 
the FCPA, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters.

If the company is found to have 
violated the FCPA, Murdoch's News Corp, which has its base in New York, 
could be fined up to $2million and barred from U.S. government 
contracts.

Individuals who took part in the 
bribery could face fines of up to $100,000 and five years' jail.

Executives could be liable if they authorised bribes or knew about the 
practice but failed to stop it.

In practice, U.S. authorities have 
usually settled FCPA cases in return for large cash payments from 
companies, who can sometimes avoid legal admissions of guilt.

Much of the evidence was handed over 
by the company, who have set up a clean-up unit in London and hired 
lawyers in Britain and the U.S., some of whom are FCPA specialists, 
company sources said.

The U.S. Justice Department and 
Securities and Exchange Commission also have jurisdiction to pursue 
civil cases against alleged violators of the law.

Bloomberg reported last year that 
Justice Department prosecutors sent News Corp a request for details on 
alleged payments which journalists made to British police officers in 
return for news tips.

Sources close to News Corp have 
discussed the Management Standards Committee of News International 
(MSC), the unit set up to deal with phone hacking and related 
investigations.

It has for some time been concerned 
about the consequences of U.S. investigations of possible FCPA 
violations, the sources said. Both News International and News Corp 
declined to comment.

Last July, the company retained Mark 
Mendelsohn, who served as deputy chief of the Fraud Section in the 
Criminal Division of the U.S. Justice Department.

Hacking claim: Law enforcement and corporate sources said no evidence had turned up that journalists from Mr Murdoch's now defunct News of the World sought to hack into voicemail messages of victims of 9/11

Mr Mendelsohn, now in private 
practice, was internationally respected as an architect of the DOJ's 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act enforcement programme.

News Corp sources confirmed that the 
Management Standards Committee was also working with Williams & 
Connolly, a prominent Washington law firm specialising in white-collar 
crime cases.

U.S. authorities reportedly found nothing to support claims that potentially illegal reporting tactics allegedly widespread in Britain were also employed by Mr Murdoch’s journalists in the U.S.

Law enforcement and corporate sources said no evidence had turned up to corroborate a Daily Mirror accusation over journalists from Mr Murdoch's now-defunct News of the World.

The Mirror claimed the NOTW reporters sought to hack into voicemail messages of victims of the Al Qaeda 9/11 attacks on the U.S. The Mirror is a competitor of Mr Murdoch's London tabloid, The Sun.

The New York Times reported last year 
that one of the lawyers working on the News Corp case was Brendan 
Sullivan, a Williams & Connolly partner.

He is known for his public defence of 
White House aide Oliver North during Congressional investigations into 
an arms-for-hostages scandal during the time of U.S. President Ronald 
Reagan.

News Corp announced last month that 
another Williams & Connolly partner, Gerson Zweifach, would become 
its top new in-house lawyer. He is also expected to join the MSC.

Company sources said that, via the 
MSC, News International was routinely sharing with its outside lawyers 
evidence which had been uncovered of suspected questionable practices.

Among evidence turned over by the 
company to British authorities are emails and financial records which 
allegedly chart the payment of more than $158,000 to police contacts, 
mostly in small sums.

A company source said the records 
showed many or most of the payments intended recipients were listed in 
company records under false names.

Arrested but not charged: To date, no criminal charges have been filed against any of the individuals arrested over the past year, who include former News International CEO Rebekah Brooks, left, and Andy Coulson, right

London's Metropolitan Police has been 
probing suspected abusive practices which journalists at the News of the
World and other Murdoch London papers allegedly routinely employed in 
recent years.

British detectives are conducting 
three parallel investigations. One inquiry, known as Operation Weeting, 
is investigating alleged phone hacking.

A second inquiry, Operation Tuleta, is
probing computer hacking claims. The third, Operation Elveden, is 
investigating allegations that journalists paid police officers bribes 
in return for tipoffs.

The head of the three investigations said this week she was increasing the number of police looking at police payments.

London police have arrested 30 people,
including journalists and police officers, in connection with its three
journalism-related investigations.

Long story: Current probes trace their roots back to the 2006 arrests, and guilty pleas, of NOTW royal reporter Clive Goodman, left, and private detective Glenn Mulcaire, right on phone hacking charges

Last month, four current and former 
journalists on The Sun, as well as a serving police officer, were 
arrested in connection with Operation Elveden.

Sue Akers, the officer in charge of 
all the investigations, said on Monday that 14 people so far had been 
arrested in connection with Operation Elveden.

But she indicated that more investigators were likely to be added to the inquiry, which she said still had some time to run.

To date, no criminal charges have been
filed against any of the individuals arrested over the past year, who 
include Rebekah Brooks, a former CEO of Murdoch's London papers.

Andy Coulson, a former Murdoch editor 
who became top media adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, was also 
arrested but not charged to date.

However, current probes trace their 
roots back to the 2006 arrests, and guilty pleas, of NOTW royal reporter
Clive Goodman and private detective Glenn Mulcaire on phone hacking 
charges.
