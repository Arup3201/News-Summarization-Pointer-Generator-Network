Cesc Fabregas made his mind up to leave Barcelona last April after they lost in the Spanish Cup to Real Madrid and the Spain midfielder sensed a trophyless season was going to end with an almighty shake-up that could well include him.

Sure enough, Barca finished the campaign empty handed and manager Tata Martino was replaced by Luis Enrique. Fabregas spoke to the club’s sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta on the phone a week after the season ended.

Fabregas told El Pais: ‘I called Zubizarreta and I knew by the response that I got that I was doing them a favour – it was the best thing for them and for me.’

After what was effectively a shrug of the shoulders from the club and not the ‘please don’t go’ message that might have changed his mind, he told his agent Darren Dein to step up the search for a club in England, with London the preferred destination.

Fabregas has always had an affiliation with the capital ever since sharing digs with Philippe Senderos when he moved to the city as a 16-year-old from Barcelona. 

Asked by a Spanish journalist recently if he felt ‘British’, Fabregas replied: ‘More than British I feel like a Londoner’ and with wife Daniella Semaan also a fan  he was always likely to favour a move to a London club over the mooted switch to either Manchester United or City.

The irony of his failure to fit back in at Barcelona was that while his off-the-field friendship with Lionel Messi was stronger than ever – the two were reunited having been in the same Under 13 side as schoolboys at Barcelona’s La Masia academy – the pair were difficult to fit into the same team on the pitch.

Messi had become the archetypal ‘False 9’ at the Nou Camp, operating as a withdrawn centre-forward. Fabregas did the same job for Spain at the 2012 European Championship. 

The former Arsenal captain loves to arrive in the space between the oppostion’s central defenders and holding midfielders but that was Messi territory.

Pep Guardiola changed Barca’s 4-3-3 system to a 3-4-3 in 2011 so that Messi could stay as the team’s deep-lying centre forward and Fabregas could operate at the top of a midfield diamond. 

The two dove-tailed brilliantly at first but the strains of playing a back three soon meant the system was binned and so began the conundrum of finding a place for Fabregas.

While Messi and partner Antonella Roccuzzo stepped out with Fabregas and Semaan more and more and both couples had new-born children to tighten the bonds, Fabregas found himself stepping out on to the pitch with Messi less and less.

In reference to being left out of Barca’s Champions League semi-final humiliation to Bayern Munich in 2013 he told Sportsmail: 'If you play one game, the next, and the next but then comes the big game away to Bayern Munich and we are losing 4-0 and you are not even warming up then it gets you down.'

He still scored 42 goals in 150 games and won the trophies that had eluded him at Arsenal and the admiration of Jose Mourinho who made his move this summer.
