A schoolboy whose fugitive father hanged himself in woods after shooting his mother has been found dead at the same spot.

Jack Williams, 16, disappeared on Monday evening – hours after his mother was released from hospital. His body was discovered by police.

Rachel Williams, who underwent ten hours of surgery to save her leg after the shooting, was said to be ‘totally devastated’ at her son’s death.

The teenager hanged himself five weeks 
after his father blasted his estranged wife with a double-barrelled 
shotgun in a hair salon, before committing suicide.

Last night, a family spokesman said: ‘Jack was finding it difficult  to come to terms with what happened. His mother was shot and  his dad found hanged all within a couple of hours.

‘He was a sensitive young man – he wasn’t coping with things.

‘Now Rachel is going through hell all over again.’

Last month Jack’s father Darren Williams, 46, burst into the salon where 39-year-old Mrs Williams worked to confront her over  their separation.

Before firing, he shouted: ‘Rachel,  I love you.’

Two elderly clients who were in the 
salon at the time suffered minor neck and arm injuries. Williams, a 
lorry driver, fled the Carol-Ann salon in Newport, South Wales, and went
 on the run for five hours.

His body was found by police at nearby Brynglas woods.

His ashes were scattered at the same location after his funeral.

A military and shooting enthusiast, 
Williams was previously jailed for four months in 2004 after police 
discovered an ‘arsenal’ in his bedroom.

His collection included a stun gun, a .22 pistol, a machete, a hun- ting knife, canisters of CS gas  and bullets.

Mrs Williams underwent extensive reconstructive surgery at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, where  she said: ‘I have no doubt he came  to kill me.’

The couple, who had been married for five years, had put their family home up for sale because of their impending divorce.

They had one child together, although Mrs Williams has another son, Josh, 20, from a previous relationship.

Jack, a pupil at Newport High School, had been living with his father’s sister while his mother recovered in hospital.

She was discharged at the weekend, but by Monday evening her son had vanished.

His body was discovered by officers at about 7.30pm.

Gwent Police yesterday confirmed that they were investigating Jack’s death, but said there were no suspicious circumstances.

An inquest is due to be opened after a post-mortem examination.
