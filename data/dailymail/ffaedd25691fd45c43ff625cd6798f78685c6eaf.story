Chelsea skipper John Terry has admitted he felt lost arriving back for pre season training without former vice captain Frank Lampard - and he doesn't like seeing the Blues legend in a sky blue kit either.

Lampard has moved onto pastures new since his Stamford Bridge contract expired - and began training with Manchester City this week as he spends six months at Chelsea's Premier League title rivals before heading for New York City FC.

But Terry found that move - and Ashley Cole's Roma switch - tough to take having spent years playing alongside the veteran pair for club and country only for the trio to now be completely split up.

'I felt lost the first few days (of pre season),' Terry admitted. 'At Cobham Lamps is next door to me and Ash is a couple up.

'We've grown up together and won and lost here at Chelsea and done many great things so I was very sad to see them go.

'And to see Ash already sign for Roma and Lamps has signed for New York... It doesn't seem right to me seeing them in different shirts. Maybe over time that will ease but it doesn't seem right,' he told Chelsea TV.

Passion: Chelsea could miss Lampard's influence in midfield - which is of course City's gain

'He's been an idol and someone I aspire to be in training, around the place, off the field. He was a great character but footballing wise I've never met someone who works as hard as he does on the field to improve his game.

'To do what he has done at the club... for me there's no one better. Lamps has been an absolute legend at this football club and his legacy will remain forever.

'This club is evolving. One day we'll all be gone.'
