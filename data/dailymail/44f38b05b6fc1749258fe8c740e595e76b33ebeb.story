Fifteen years ago today, a small online bookseller made its first sales in Britain.

Now it has grown into a global internet phenomenon, offering everything from clothes to car parts, raking in £4billion a year and causing carnage among high street retailers.

And it all happened with a substantial helping hand from some Harry Potter hocus pocus.

A list of Amazon’s best-sellers released to mark its birthday shows the part JK Rowling’s magical books, and the associated films and computer games, have played in the website’s transformation.

Billions: The small-scale British bookseller now sells car parts and clothes earning £4billion a year

In 1998, the best-selling product was Amsterdam, a Booker prize-winning morality tale by Ian McEwan.

But the next year the third Harry Potter book – Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban – proved a runaway success, while later instalments topped the list in 2000, 2003, 2005 and 2007. The Tales Of Beedle The Bard, a related book of stories, sold most in 2008.

Harry Potter films led video and DVD sales in four years, and a computer game was a 2001 best-seller.

Amazon’s vice president of EU retail, Xavier Garambois, said: ‘The annual best-sellers help to tell a story of the phenomena that have gripped the UK. Since starting out as an online bookseller in 1998, Amazon.co.uk has expanded year on year and now offers customers more than 100million products.’

Flagship sellers: EL James' Fifty Shades Of Grey and Jamie Oliver's cookbooks also boosted sales for the site

The list, released by the website, gives a snapshot of Britain’s buying habits, from gadgets and kitchen products to films and music.

Last year, EL James’s erotic novel Fifty Shades Of Grey topped the book list, initiating a new literary genre of so-called ‘mummy porn’.  Stieg Larsson’s dark thriller The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was number one in both 2010 and 2011, while ultra-violent video game Grand Theft Auto 5, created in Britain, is a best-seller this year, reaching a bigger audience than most blockbuster films.

On a more wholesome note, TV chef Jamie Oliver’s books were top sellers in 2001 and 2010.

The figures record the company’s rapid expansion, with best-selling home goods first listed in 2003, and MP3 music sales in 2008.

the amazon phenomenon by numbers

Amazon’s fierce discounts and low overheads have helped it build UK sales of more than £4billion. The retailer enjoys an advantage over high street rivals since it does not have to pay to maintain stores, including rent, rates and staff.

Controversially, it has also avoided tax, paying a paltry £2.4million to the UK Treasury last year. It also received £2.5million in Government and EU grants for operating warehouses in less prosperous areas.

The figures have angered MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee. Its chairman Margaret Hodge has said: ‘Its behaviour is not only unfair, it is anti-competitive, putting British businesses that do pay the proper tax at a disadvantage.’
