A three-year-old-girl was run over and killed when a freak gust of wind blew her buggy into the path of a reversing van, an inquest heard.

Olivia Langley died from severe head injuries after being hit by a delivery van just as her mother was about to take her to to nursery school.

Louise Uffindell dashed inside her home in Croydon, south London, to check her gas meter, leaving Olivia in her pushchair just outside the door.

Killed: Olivia Langley was on her way to nursery school when she was run over by a delivery van

Dashed inside: Olivia's mother, Louise Uffindell, left, submitted a statement to Croydon Coroner's Court describing the accident

Distraught: Louise Uffindell was too upset to attend the inquest at Croydon Coroner's Court

But then she heard an ‘unusual’ noise and ran out to discover the girl lying in the road.

She scooped her up and screamed ‘My child, my child!’ in grief before she desperately tried to give her daughter mouth-to-mouth after the collision on 25 March last year.

Ms Uffindell, 34, was too distraught at her daughter’s death to attend the inquest at Croydon Coroner’s Court, which ruled that her daughter's death was an accident.

However, she submitted a statement, which began by telling how she was running late that morning.

She decided to put Olivia in a pushchair
 because it would be quicker and added: ‘We got outside and I remembered
 I needed to check the gas meter to see how much credit I had.

Scene: The driver of the delivery van described how he felt only a 'touch' when he came into contact with the pushchair

‘I put the pushchair on the pavement and left it outside while I quickly went back in and checked, and left Olivia sitting in the pushchair on the pavement immediately outside.

‘I did not put the brake on. I was only inside the flat for a few moments when I heard an unusual noise. I can’t explain the noise, I didn’t know what it was, but it got my attention and made me run outside.

‘When I got outside I found Olivia and her pushchair. They were both lying on their left side fully in the road.

Distraught: Olivia's father, Stewart Langley, pictured laying a tribute after her death, appeared in court today but was too upset to speak

‘Olivia was positioned as if she was still in it. The van was directly in front of them.

‘My immediate reaction was just to get Olivia out of the road and pick her up.

‘I was running up and down the street and telling the people in the van to call an ambulance.’

Ms Uffindell said she initially thought delivery driver Clinton Jackson and his passenger Tracy Phillips must have been speeding to hit her child.

She said: ‘I said “Why were you speeding,” the woman said “we weren’t.”

‘I assumed they must have been because they had hit Olivia but I did not see the van before the collision or the collision itself.’

The court heard the weather was ‘exceptionally windy’ and the road was in poor condition with potholes in the street.

Looking very emotional as he recounted the tragedy, Mr Jackson said: ‘I started to reverse, it must have been only a second or two into the reverse when I felt what I said was a touch. It didn’t feel like a hit or a bump, it was a touch.

‘I felt that, knowing that the floor had potholes and rubble and things, before I carried on any further I stopped.’

Mr Jackson, who was marking his birthday on the day, added: ‘I felt the touch and she just stepped out of the door.

‘I saw her running saying “My child, my child”. I was thinking, what child? Until she picked her up, and that’s when I thought - her child. That’s when I first caught sight of her.’

Ms Phillips, who broke down in tears as she listened to the evidence, told the inquest: ‘I saw Olivia in her pushchair outside her front door as he did a full lock to reverse.

‘He was looking behind and then the next minute Olivia’s mother came out screaming. We looked at each other in shock and then she picked the little girl up from the floor.’

Mark Crouch, a car crash 
investigator, told the court: ‘It was extremely windy and the 
arrangement of the buildings created somewhat of a wind tunnel.

‘Throughout the investigation there were a number of times when the wind picked up and pushed the buggy along the road.

Sympathies: Mr Langley's gift joined others outside Olivia's home in Croydon

Although one of the van’s mirrors was partly smashed, this wouldn’t have contributed to the accident because the pushchair was ‘completely’ in the driver’s ‘blind spot.’

He said the most likely scenario was that the buggy moved from the pavement into the road and ‘fell face down.’

Coroner Dr Roy Palmer recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Addressing Olivia’s father Stewart Langley, a former boxer, who sat in the front row, the coroner said: ‘Obviously I’m so very sorry you lost Olivia in such sad circumstances.

‘Its a great shame that the brake wasn’t on the buggy, but whether that would have made any difference we don’t know. It was very windy.

‘I’m so sorry you lost your daughter in that way. My sympathies to all of her family, including her mother who I know is to upset to come today.’

Mr Langley was too upset to speak as he left court.
