It's a noise heard in playgrounds across the country by children pretending to fire lasers at each other, but the phrase 'pew pew pew' almost became the activation command for Google Glass.

Google's wearable computer is controlled by voice commands and in order to get Google Glass to listen and accept an instruction, an activation phrase is needed.

The current phrase is 'okay glass' followed by the command, but managers from Google mulled over more humorous alternatives, such as 'pew pew pew', 'hear me now' and 'glassicus'. 

Wearers of Google Glass can say a phrase to activate the voice command feature and get the wearable tech to listen and accept instructions. The current phrase is 'okay glass' yet reports claims firm considered alternative 'hotwords' including 'Pew Pew Pew' and Go Go Glass'

Google Glass' voice command system was first revealed in February when the search giant released a video that showed a user taking a photo by saying 'okay glass, take a picture'.

Similarly, videos can be recorded when a user says 'okay glass, record a video.'

The 'okay glass' phrase is known as a Google 'hotword.'

According to Emil Protalinski at The Next Web, the hotword idea emerged out of a conversation between Google Glass' marketing manager, Amanda Rosenberg, and its product manager, Mat Balezin, in April 2012.

Apparently 'okay glass' was the hotword suggested by Rosenberg and this was the phrase used in the final product.

She also reportedly revealed that there were more humorous suggestions for the hotword, including: 'pew pew pew,' 'glassicus' and one that Inspector Gadget might enjoy, 'go go Glass'.

'Hear me now,' 'listen up Glass' and 'Glass alive' were also considered.

It could become the norm to hear Google Glass-wearing people saying 'okay glass' followed by a command.

One of the alternative phrases might have sounded stranger in public.

In less humorous news, Lookout, a security research firm uncovered a vulnerability of Google Glass that let hackers use QR codes to gain control of the wearable computer.

However, Google was quick to patch the problem, The Verge reported.

The security firm believes that if hackers had exploited the vulnerability, they would have been able to use a malicious QR code to force Google Glass to connect to a Wi-Fi access point and allow them to read all the data flowing to and from the headset.

A young Californian hacker called Stephen Balaban is building an alternative operating system for his Google Glass that is not controlled by Google, according to NPR.

His aim is to make it possible to use his Google Glass for a whole host of things that Google has not thought of or intended.

It is feared by many that the use of Google Glass with its intelligent cameras will erode our privacy. Hackers have managed to use facial recognition on Google Glass and create software that allows a wearer to take a photo by winking

Many people fear that the use of Google Glass with its intelligent cameras will erode people's privacy.

A recent study by web hosting firm 
Rackspace and Goldsmiths University found that one in five adults in the
UK wants to ban Google Glass completely, because of such privacy concerns.

According to Google, the device has been designed so that it is obvious to passers by how the device is being used.

For example, people can hear camera voice commands or see someone tap their temple before the screen lights up.

But hackers are gradually proving that they are able to modify the device, which has put Google in a tricky situation of trying to welcome creative new ideas that could progress its product while maintaining its stance on being pro-privacy.

Mr Balaban said he got a frosty response from Google when he told them that he had built an app that enables Google Glass to use facial recognition to identify people.

Google has said it will not support apps that make this technology possible.

Another hacker has reportedly developed a programme called Winky that lets wearers take a photo by winking.
