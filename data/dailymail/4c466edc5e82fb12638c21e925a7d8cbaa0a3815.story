Is there anything more important to a bride and groom at their reception than getting that all important first wedding dance just right?

Perhaps ensuring that there is at least one super-cute kid making everyone smile by busting a few serious dance moves.

This little boy was captured on film expressing himself through dance in the way only young children can, and YouTube regular Blake Weir posted it on his page with the title 'The best dancer I've ever seen' - for obvious reasons.

One Direction eat your heart out: The boy is clearly enjoying himself as he spins around and points his toes

The dance floor is mainly filled with children but one little boy stands out a mile with his unforgettable dance moves.

The phrase 'dance like nobody is watching' might have been invented for this little boy as he spins around, jumps and leaps in the air and generally looks like he's having the time of his life.

Oblivious to his surroundings - and to the fact that he's being filmed by one of the wedding guests - he gives One Direction a run for their money with his highly original dance moves.

Get your groove on: The boy is certainly light on his feet - perhaps helped by the fact that he's kicked his shoes off and is able to slide around on the dancefloor. The arm movements are pretty cool too

The man filming the footage is clearly impressed by the display, commenting: 'Look at this kid go. Yes, he is fabulous.'

As the boy approaches a young girl his age, the man filming says: 'Leave her alone it's all you bro you got this.'

Laughing at the energetic display, he adds: 'He is talented.'

he's been inspired by modern singers and dance groups or perhaps seen some old films with Fred and Ginger isn't clear, but this boy has certainly got some style.

At one point he spins around and nearly loses his balance but manages to recover himself and carry on dancing totally unconcerned about who is watching.
