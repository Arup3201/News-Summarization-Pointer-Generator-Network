The parents of a seven-year-old boy are desperately trying to raise £255,000 in 11 days so he can have life-saving treatment for a brain tumour that was originally diagnosed as a migraine.

Jasmine and Rad Novakovic are making a desperate public appeal to help send son Alex for specialist radiotherapy in America.

From a standing start, the couple have already succeeded in raising almost £60,000 from well-wishers in just three days.

Alex complained of headaches and nausea for three months and Jasmine, 41, took him several times to her GP and for hospital tests.

Alex's parents launched the fundraising appeal when they discovered that proton bean therapy in America was his only chance of survival

But instead of diagnosing his brain tumour, doctors diagnosed a migraine and even suspected scarlet fever.

It was only when Alex collapsed suddenly at the dinner table on November 15 that he was correctly diagnosed by doctors at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital.

But by then his malignant brain tumour was so far advanced that it was thought to be terminal.

Since then, Alex has had endless tests, scans, surgery and intensive chemotherapy for his stage 4 tumour.

At one stage, he was given only days to live but neurosurgeons managed to remove some of the tumour.

Few hospitals worldwide offer the proton radiotherapy Alex needs quickly to survive and nearly all have long waiting lists.

But Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said it can treat Alex for six weeks from April 30 and doctors there say there is every chance he would make a full recovery.

Delay: Alex complained of headaches and nausea for three months. Despite repeated visits to doctors and hospital tests, his parents were told he just had a migraine

The expensive proton beam treatment is not available on the NHS and Jasmine and husband Rad, 53, have to pay the hospital fees up front.

There are other conventional radiotherapy options in this country but there would be more side effects and his chances of survival would be slim.

Alex, who has three sisters - Kristina, 13, Victoria, 11 and Elizabeth, 3 - has been off school since November.

Jasmine is trying to get celebrities to highlight Alex’s plight and singer Joss Stone and TV presenter Jeff Brazier have already lent their support.

Joss alerted all her fans on Facebook and since then donations have poured in with £56,500 raised in just three days.

Jasmine, from Aylesbury, Bucks, said: 'Alex was complaining of headaches and feeling sick on and off for several months and taking a lot of time off school.

Treatment: Alex has had endless tests, scans, surgery and intensive chemotherapy for his stage 4 tumour

'I took him to the doctor on a few occasions but he only diagnosed a migraine and sent us away.

'He actually vomited in the doctor’s surgery on one occasion.

'I
 took him as an emergency case to Stoke Mandeville Hospital and they 
thought it might be scarlet fever and gave him antibiotics.

'Then one night at dinner he said he was feeling unwell and asked to leave the table. As he got up, he collapsed.'

Alex was rushed to Stoke Mandeville where he had an MRI scan before being taken to John Radcliffe Hospital.

Jasmine said: 'I feel devastated that his brain tumour could have been picked up much earlier.

'One of the John Radcliffe surgeons said that even a month sooner would have meant a better prognosis.

'I can’t describe how awful it has been since Alex collapsed. To be given the news that the tumour was terminal and there was nothing they could do was soul-destroying.

'They said that the tumour had progressed so rapidly that they had to try and take as much out as possible.

Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston say there is every chance he will make a full recovery when treated with proton beam therapy

'Alex recovered from that remarkably well and since then he has been having chemotherapy.

'He
 lost his hair but he is a strong, brave, mature boy. I have told him I 
am trying to get him better treatment in America and he understands 
that.

'Conventional 
radiotherapy targets not just the cancer but all the healthy organs and 
tissue and we have been told Alex would have a slim chance of survival. 
Proton radiotherapy only targets the cancer.

'We've been warned it was unlikely anyone would take Alex because of his prognosis.

'There are long waiting lists; so many people are turned away; and we would not have time to organise it anyway.'

But Jasmine’s brother Daniel O’Brien, 31, contacted Massachusetts General Hospital and persuaded them to review Alex’s scans.

Jasmine
 said: 'They e-mailed me and said that Alex would be a great candidate 
for proton radiotherapy and that they felt he had every chance of being 
cured.

Hope: The fundraising appeal has so far raised £270,000

'I have spoken to mothers of other English children who have had the treatment there and made a full recovery.

'I am flabbergasted that this opportunity has arisen as a result of my brother pushing it. Getting this opportunity to go to Boston feels like winning the lottery.

'The last few months have been like a bad dream in and out of hospitals. This has given me so much hope.'

Board game designer Rad has not worked since Alex was diagnosed in November and the family cannot afford the expensive hospital fees.

Jasmine said: 'I have promised the hospital in America that I will find the money.

'They said that we had to pay up front. I asked whether we can have longer to pay but have not heard back yet.

'I’ve never done anything like this before. I’m just a housewife.'

Jasmine thanked Joss for her help, saying: 'We really appreciate what she is doing for Alex.'
