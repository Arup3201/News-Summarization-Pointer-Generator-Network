The parents of a star high school athlete who was shot and killed by a neighbor when the 16-year-old crawled into the wrong house in his neighborhood have forgiven the man who killed their son.

Shawn and Jennea Gordley today said that they do not blame their son's killer, adding that they understand why Caleb was killed in the upscale northern Virginia neighborhood of Sterling. 

Police say that Caleb Gordley sneaked out of his parents' house on Saturday night to drink with his high school friends.

The basketball star walked back to his neighborhood, hopped a fence and crawled in a back window in the early morning hours. He didn't realize, though, that the house he had entered was not his own home, but rather one that was two doors down from where he lived.

Fallen: Caleb Gordley, 16, was shot and killed at around 2.30am on Sunday morning when he entered his neighbour's home two doors down from his own, seemingly by mistake, after a night of drinking with friends

Mourning: Shawn and Jennea Gordley forgave the neighbor who shot and killed their son

The owner, fearing a prowler, shot and killed Caleb.

'I just want you to know I forgive you. I understand this was an accident,' Caleb's mother Jennae Gordley said, according to WJLA-TV.

'I do, too,' father Shawn Gordley added. 'All the answers in the world are not going to bring him back.'

Mr Gordley added that he only hopes his son wasn't scared the moment he was killed by the startled neighbor.

'We got 16-and-a-half awesome years out of that young man. And I will hold on to that,' the heartbroken father said.

Friends of the teen's are calling the fatal shooting a terrible accident and saying that after a night of drinking, he must have mistaken the house for his own seeing as they are almost identical from behind and he had only lived in the area for a year.

'Knowing Caleb, he wouldn't have bad intentions,' said one in an interview with WUSA9. 'He was a good kid.'

Those who know Donald West Wilder II, the homeowner of the property where the incident took place, meanwhile spoke highly of the community-minded firefighter, adding further mystery to the alleged mix-up.

According to sources at Park View High School where Gordley was a student, the victim had been out drinking with friends until late on Saturday night and had been dropped off at the quiet Sterling, Virginia cul-de-sac where he lived,  at around 2.30am.

Close: Because of the proximity of the houses and the fact that they appear similar at night time, investigators think he may have accidentally gone into the wrong home at the time he was shot

For reasons unknown, however, the 
popular basketball player and promising rapper went to Mr Wilder's house
and tried to enter instead of his own.

Some reports suggest that he may have entered through a back window and set off a security alarm.

Though the Loudon County Sheriff's office continues to investigate before confirming details, one law enforcement official told the Washington Post that Gordley had attempted to walk upstairs where the family were sleeping before he was shot.

Hearing an intruder, Mr Wilder called 911 to report the break-in but by the time authorities reached the property, a large mansion-style two-storey home on the 45900 block of Pullman Court, Gordely was already dead.

Mystery visit: An unidentified man tried to talk to someone at the house where the incident took place but after gesticulating wildly was shut out

Escape: After fleeing in his car, he backed up the street in reverse and ran into the house where Gordley lived with his family

Virginia law permits homeowners to use deadly force if they feel threatened inside their own homes.

Neighbour
Joanna Roman, could not understand the tragedy. She described Mr Wilder
as 'a great neighbor, a helper, someone who spends spare time 
volunteering to help others. He's an active member of our community. 
He's a good person.'

Similarly, another Pullman Court resident, Khang Nguyen, called Mr Wilder a 'very nice gentleman, very quiet, too.'

Star: Gordley was described by students and coaches as an excellent athlete, a popular boy and a gifted rapper who had good intentions

Meanwhile, students and friends of the slain teen have rallied to his defence, calling the shooting 'shocking'.

'He was on the basketball team, baseball... he brought happiness to the whole team,' said one friend.

A heartbroken classmate told NBC: 'If you had classes with him, there was no way you weren't leaving that class without a smile.'

A promising rap artist as well as a regular fixture on the sports scene, Gordley had been living in the Sterling cul-de-sac with his famly for about a year.

Some neighbours admitted that they didn't know the family well and saw other tenants coming and going from the Gordley home since they had moved in.

Both their home and Mr Wilder's were built at the same time and look almost identical which may explain the confusion if Caleb Gordley was intoxicated. A full toxicology report is still pending.

Earlier today an unidentified man visited the house where the shooting took place and had a confrontation with a man who answered the door. He gesticulated wildly before the man closed the door and then getting in a car, backed up the street, lept out and ran into the home of Caleb Gordley.

Police cars returned to the scene and officers were seen coming and going between the two properties all afternoon.

At Park View High School meanwhile, grief counselors were on call and an assembly to remember Gordley was arranged for the mourning youngsters who will miss their friend.
