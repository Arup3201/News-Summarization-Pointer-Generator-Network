Team news: Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti is ready to unleash the full might of his enviable playing resources in Tuesday's UEFA Super Cup clash against La Liga rivals Sevilla.

World Cup stars James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos, signed from Monaco and Bayern Munich this summer, are set to feature in Ancelotti's starting line-up at Cardiff City Stadium.

Local hero: Real Madrid's Welsh forward Gareth Bale at Cardiff City Stadium on Monday

They will be paraded alongside the likes of Wales star Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo as Real target more European silverware just under a fortnight before their domestic campaign begins.

Sevilla are expected to line up with Barcelona loanee Denis Suarez, who was part of the deal which saw skipper Ivan Rakitic sold to the Catalan club for £14million this summer. 

Iago Aspas and Grzegorz Krychowiak also joined Sevilla this summer - the former on loan from Liverpool, the latter bought from Reims - and both are predicted to start.

Real Madrid are the only team to lose a European Super Cup to a golden goal; they were beaten 2-1 by Galatasaray in 2000.

The last UEFA Super Cup to feature two teams from the same country also featured Sevilla; they beat Barcelona 3-0 in the 2006 edition.

Sevilla were also the last Spanish side to lose this game; they were beaten 3-1 by Milan in 2007. The last four Spanish sides to qualify for this competition have won.

The one previous clash in a major European competition came in the 1958 European Cup quarter-final. Los Merengues won 8-0 at home before drawing 2-2 away to progress.
