Inappropriate: A witness claimed that accused Gabe Watson (left) made remarks at the funeral of his wife Tina (right) about her 'perky breasts'

Gabe Watson, who is accused of murdering his wife on their honeymoon, allegedly said: 'At least her breasts are perky' when he viewed his bride in her coffin.

The bizarre revelation came from Amanda Phillips, Mrs Watson's maid-of-honour, who said Gabe made the remark to her at her best friend's wake.

Mrs Watson, 26, drowned during a scuba diving trip on her honeymoon in Australia in 2003.

Gabe Watson, 34, is suspected of killing
his wife  
after he turned off her air supply, the prosecution claimed. He is 
facing a life sentence without parole.

Amanda Phillips made an emotional testimony to the Alabama court today.

Ms Phillips recounted how she went to view her friend in the coffin with Gabe Watson.

She told the court: 'I said she looked pretty in her dress. Gabe said, ''At least her breasts are perky.'''

Following the funeral, Ms Phillips said 
her suspicions were aroused by Watson's actions.

At his home after the 
service, he reportedly showed pictures of his late wife next to a sign which read 
'Caution: Drowning'.

Ms Phillips said her best friend had broken up with Gabe Watson in the months before their wedding
after she fell for another man. However she later returned 
to Watson, reported the Courier-Mail.

Ms Phillips said initially she had been convinced that her friend's death in the Great Barrier Reef,  11 days after she 
married, was a tragic accident. 

The defense contends Mrs Watson's death was an accidental drowning.

Gabe Watson served 18 months in prison in 
Australia after pleading guilty to a manslaughter charge in his wife's 
death but that charge involved negligence, not an intentional killing.

The accused's allegedly odd remarks about his dead wife came to light as another witness testified today that the diving firm violated its own rules in
preparing the woman for the fatal trip in 2003.

Happiness: Gabe and Tina Watson on their wedding day in 2003 - 11 days before Mrs Watson drowned during a honeymoon diving trip

Wade Singleton, who was dive master on the 
trip, said 26-year-old Tina didn't get a 
private briefing or an orientation dive before going into the water with
her husband - despite policies that require both.

Mr Singleton admitted that he and 
other crew members didn't ask a number of questions of Mrs Watson - a 
novice with only 11 previous dives.

Government regulations in Australia required professional diving teams to make in-depth, individual assessments of divers' skills.

However employees on the boat, the Spoilsport, didn't perform all the checks on Tina Watson or other divers, Mr Singleton said.

Defense lawyer Brett Bloomston asked: 'Were you not aware that she had never been in the ocean in an open water dive?'

Mr Singleton, who now works as a paramedic, said: 'No, I was not.'

The former dive master said Mrs Watson's new husband Gabe was considered an experienced diver because he had 55 previous dives, including more than a dozen in the ocean.

I said she looked pretty in her dress. Gabe said, 'At least her breasts are perky.'

Both he and his wife declined an orientation dive on the Great Barrier Reef site with an expert.

The prosecution asked Mr Singleton: 'You can't make them take the dive if they don't want to take the dive?'

He responded: 'No, I can't.'

The jury of eight women and six men have previously looked at a haunting underwater photo taken by another diver of the death scene.

It
showed Tina sprawled in deep water as Watson swam to the surface. 
Prosecutors appeared to attempt to cast doubt on Watson's version of 
what happened.

They believe 
Watson turned off his wife's air supply while both were underwater and 
held her in a bear-hug until she lost consciousness - before turning the
air back on and letting her sink.

Tina Watson's father, Tommy Thomas, left the courtroom in tears today as an Australian medical examiner showed jurors autopsy photos. 

Dr David John Williams said an examination determined the woman drowned and he ruled out other factors including a heart problem that she'd had several years earlier.

Prosecutors contend Watson killed his wife in hopes of collecting $210,000 in insurance benefits.

Caesar Lamonica, a manager at the store where Tina Watson worked, testified that Watson came in less than a month after her death asking about a life insurance policy.

The defense has argued that Watson did not stand to make financial gain because Tina Watson's father was the beneficiary of her life insurance policy and a travel insurance policy only covered expenses.

The trial continues.
