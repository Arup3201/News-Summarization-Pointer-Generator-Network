Former Major League Baseball player and convicted sex offender Chad Curtis has given an explosive interview from his jail cell ... and said he forgives his victims for putting him behind bars.

The 44-year-old was sentenced to seven-to-15 years in prison for sexually assaulting three young girls last December - two of whom were only 15 at the time of the assault - in the weight room of a high school where he was a volunteer coach.

But, four months after his incarceration at Harrison Correctional Facility in Michigan, the staunch Christian has repeated his claims that his victims made the allegations up.

Describing one of his victims, then a 
15-year-old sophomore, he declared: 'She'll wake up, throw up her hands 
and just say, 'I can't do it anymore. And when that happens, I have 
every intention of forgiving her.'

But, four months after his incarceration at Harrison Correctional Facility in Michigan, the staunch Christian has claimed his victims made the allegations up

The interview, published in Sports on Earth, describes the claims of the three girls in detail.

He was first accused of inappropriately touching the buttocks of two female students, both 15 at the time of the incidents, in April 2012, while he was the volunteer strength and conditioning coach at Lakewood High School.

A third student, 16, then came forward and said Curtis touched her private areas and kissed her breasts the previous summer.

But
 Curtis told Sports on Earth that the first accusation against him broke
 on his 3-year-old's birthday, and the second on that of his his 
11-year-old. He said he was arrested on the day of his 19-year-old's 
graduation.

He then claimed: 'Now, is that coincidental? Or is that someone looking at your personal file and deciding to mess with you?'

Before the judge handed down his 
sentence, Curtis gave a long and rambling statement - lasting more 
than an hour - in which he denied the assaults, accused the girls of 
propositioning him and said he led prison inmates at Barry County Jail 
to Christ.

The two-time World Series champion 
was set to become the Lakewood High School’s head football coach last 
fall, but resigned when the allegations were made public.

During
 his statement he accused all of his victims of lying and said that one 
day he would write a book with one of the girls that 'would benefit 
millions of people', adding, 'the truth will set her free'.

As he told the judge he was the one who 
told the girls he would not engage in a romantic relationship with them,
 his victims stormed out of the courtroom.

His
 16-year-old victim who testified that he touched her private areas and 
fondled and kissed her breasts, made a statement prior to sentencing 
before a packed courtroom that included Curtis’ wife, MLive reports.

'I,
 myself, kept giving you a chance to walk away from the monster you'd 
become,' she said. 'As a Christian, I don’t hope for any bad things to happen to 
you. I hope for good things. I hope you admit what you’ve 
done to God and yourself.'

Another said: 'There was a time I believed you to be a man of high morals and 
integrity. That time is long gone. Now, a little over two years later, I
 have a better view of who you really are. You are a manipulator and a 
perpetual liar.'

Curtis played 10 seasons during his big league career. First coming up with the then-California Angels in 1992. The outfielder then moved on to the Detroit Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees and Texas Rangers.

He won two World Series rings with the Yankees in 1999 in 2000 – famously hitting a game winning walk-off home run in the 10th inning of game three of the 1999 World Series, his second of the game.

Curtis retired from professional baseball in 2001 at the age of 32.

The soon-to-be convict was previously athletic director at another school district before being dismissed for reasons unknown, which Curtis explained as differences with the administration.

When the allegations were first made public, the devout Christian asked his community to pray that the case ‘would be resolved in a way that is honoring God'.
