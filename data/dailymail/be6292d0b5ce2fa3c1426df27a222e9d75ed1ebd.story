New Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols is among the 19 new cardinals that Pope Francis announced today

The Archbishop of Westminster has said he is 'humbled' to be appointed a cardinal by the Pope.

Vincent Nichols will be made a cardinal at the next consistory on February 22, the Catholic Church in England and Wales confirmed.

Archbishop Vincent said: 'Today, I am deeply moved by the honour conferred upon the Catholic Church in England and Wales and on the Diocese of Westminster in my appointment as Cardinal by His Holiness Pope Francis.

'The Catholic Church in our countries has always had a profound and loving loyalty to the Holy Father, the Successor of St Peter. This appointment enables me, on behalf of all, to serve the Pope in a direct and prolonged way.

'Personally, this is a humbling moment when I am asked to take a place in this service of the Holy See and in the line of much loved Cardinal Archbishops of Westminster.

'I seek the blessing of Almighty God for these new responsibilities and I ask for the prayers of all people of faith that I may fulfil them with energy and devotion.'

Pope Francis chose 19 men from Asia, Africa, Latin America and elsewhere, including the developing nations of Haiti and Burkina Faso, in line with his belief that the church must pay more attention to the poor.

Francis made the announcement as he spoke from his studio window to a crowd in St. Peter's Square.

Sixteen of the appointees are younger than 80, meaning they are currently eligible to elect the next pope, which is a cardinal's most important task. The ceremony to formally install them as cardinals will be held February 22 at the Vatican.

A U.S.-based advocacy group for people who have been sexually abused by clergy criticised one of the pope's appointments and also said he should have promoted an archbishop in Ireland to cardinal's rank.

Since his election in March as the first pontiff from Latin America, the pope has broken tradition after tradition in terms of protocol and style at the Vatican. But in Sunday's list Francis stuck to the church's rule of having no more than 120 cardinals eligible to elect the next pontiff.

Some appointments were expected, including that of his new secretary of state, the Italian archbishop Pietro Parolin, and the German head of the Vatican's watchdog office for doctrinal orthodoxy, Gerhard Ludwig Mueller. Two others named Sunday also come from the curia, as the Holy See's Rome-based bureaucracy is known.

The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said the pope's selection of churchmen from Haiti and Burkina Faso reflects Francis' attention to the destitute as a core part of the church's mission.

Once again, the cardinal's red hat eluded Dublin Archbishop Diarmuid Martin. The prelate in that traditionally Catholic country has angered some in the Vatican by strongly criticising how the hierarchy handled the worldwide clerical sex abuse scandal.

The U.S.-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, expressed disappointment that Francis didn't promote Martin. 'While far from perfect, he's better' than some other prelates on abuse, said David Clohessy, director of the group's chapter in St. Louis.

SNAP also criticised the choice of Mueller, saying he had a 'dreadful' record on children's safety.

Under the tenure of Mueller, who was appointed by fellow German Pope Benedict XVI, critics have accused of Vatican's handling of the sex abuse scandal, including letting paedophile priests transfer from parish to parish when complaints were made.
