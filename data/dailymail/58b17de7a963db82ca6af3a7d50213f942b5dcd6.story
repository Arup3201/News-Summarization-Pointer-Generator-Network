Teachers going through the menopause are being discriminated against and need more support such as cooler classrooms and regular rest breaks, a union says.

Women are being forced out of teaching because senior staff are failing to support them at a ‘very difficult time’, according to the National Union of Teachers.

It said yesterday that some heads unfairly targeted older women for disciplinary proceedings rather than addressing problems they might face, such as difficulties linked to the menopause and outdated training.

High classroom temperatures, poor ventilation and inadequate toilet facilities made symptoms worse for them, it added.

At their annual conference next week, NUT members will debate the issues and are expected to call for guidance for schools to be drawn up ‘urgently’.

The resolution says they are ‘concerned that there is an increasing trend in schools of targeting teachers who are over 50 with a view to end their employment early’.

It adds: ‘Menopausal women can experience
 hot flushes, headaches, tiredness and sweating. High workplace 
temperatures, poor ventilation, poor or non-existent rest or toilet 
facilities, or a lack of access to cold drinking water at work can make 
all of these symptoms worse.’

Other symptoms included temporary memory loss, not being able to finish a sentence and feelings of anxiety.

They want schools to offer the women the option of part-time working or job shares and to consider how timetables and workloads affect those going through the menopause. Schools which fail to ‘make suitable adjustments’ could face strike action.

The NUT said it had strong anecdotal evidence that women over 50 were more likely to be subjected to capability procedures – which examine a teacher’s competence – than younger colleagues.

NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: ‘We often find that the approach in schools now is that if you’ve been doing it for a long time, you must be stale and not quite the ticket.’
