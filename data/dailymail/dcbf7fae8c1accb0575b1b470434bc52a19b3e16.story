An American artist who makes creepy, yet realistic celebrity dolls has turned his attention to the British royal family.  

Noel Cruz from Tustin, California, has been creating doll versions of stars like Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe for years, but he has recently been producing extremely lifelike copies of the Duchess of Cambridge and the late Princess Diana.

The 53-year-old buys Barbies and other dolls from normal toy stores, then spends days transforming them into stars, using paint, mini wigs and doll-sized clothes.

An American artist who makes creepy, yet realistic celebrity dolls has turned his attention to the British royal family. Noel Cruz from Tustin, California, has recently been producing extremely lifelike copies of the Duchess of Cambridge and the late Princess Diana

The artist spends up to three days painting the intricate faces of each model - sometimes working for eight hours straight - as he did with this Princess Diana Doll

Noel's works sell for up to $5100 (£3300) and includes the likes of Lady Gaga, Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez. 

He spends up to three days painting the intricate faces of each model - sometimes working for eight hours straight.

Once he has completed the painting, he sells the dolls on eBay.

Noel, who lives in Tustin in California,  said: 'I became interested in this by accident as my wife has been a collector of dolls for years.'

Once Noel has completed the doll, like this finished Harry Potter, he sells it on eBay 

In 2001, Noel (pictured) decided to paint his first doll - a made-up female - before becoming confident enough to take on some of the planet's biggest celebrities.

He continued: 'It's painstaking work on such a small canvas so delicately done - it can be longer than an eight-hour shift.'

While looking around the internet for dolls for his wife Emma, he noticed some of the dolls available had extremely lifelike faces.

In the future, Noel, whose background is as a portrait artist, hopes to work on characters from hits like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones.

But his favourite characters to create are classic Hollywood stars such as Marilyn Monroe and Bette Davis.

He added: 'I gravitate towards celebrities because there are so many pictures of them available it's more of a challenge.'
