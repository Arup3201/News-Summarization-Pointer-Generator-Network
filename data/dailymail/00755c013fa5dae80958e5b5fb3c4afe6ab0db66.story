It’s been awarded the coveted title of best airport in the world for the past seven years running.

And judging from Singapore’s Changi Airport’s plans for expansion, it’s not prepared to give up the top spot.

Boasting a lush indoor garden area and a cascading waterfall, renderings for the futuristic bio-dome have been revealed by architect Moshe Safdie. 

Bio dome: The glass doughnut-shaped structure will be made out of glass and steel

Shaped like a doughnut, the five-storey glass and steel structure – codenamed Project Jewel – will connect the airports existing three terminals via all-glass walkways.

Safdie, who is renowned for his eco-topic buildings, was behind Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands Resort.

Project Jewel’s gardens will also include green walls to offset the emissions from the planes overhead, and it is expected to serve nearly 85 million passengers by the time it is completed.

Although a completion date for the £800m ($1.5bn) project has not been released.

The dome will also offer travellers luxury shops and leisure attractions.

Mr Lee Seow Hiang, CAG’s Chief Executive Officer, said: ‘We are very excited about this opportunity to create at Changi Airport an iconic global attraction that will capture the hearts of both tourists and Singaporeans.

‘For tourists, we envisage Project Jewel to be a must-visit Singapore attraction, located strategically at the doorstep of one of the world’s busiest air hubs, and an extension of the Changi brand promise that many travellers worldwide have come to know us for.

‘For Singaporeans, it will be an exciting world-class destination right here at home, where they can relax and enjoy with their loved ones, again and again.’
