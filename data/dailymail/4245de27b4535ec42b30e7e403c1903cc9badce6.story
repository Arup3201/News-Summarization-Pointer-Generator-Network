Nelson Mandela is 'in good shape' and 'good spirits', South African president Jacob Zuma said today.

He spoke as the first footage emerged of the 94-year-old former president since he left hospital on April 6 after suffering from pneumonia.

He spent 10 days in hospital being treated for the illness, which followed an earlier hospitalisation in December when he developed a lung infection and gallstones.

Recovering: Nelson Mandela was said to be in 'good spirits' but appeared expressionless on camera

The video shows Mandela sitting upright in an armchair, surrounded by friends, family, politicians and medical staff at his home in Johannesburg.

It is the first public image of him since Hillary Clinton visited in her role as US secretary of state in August.

Mandela - also known as Madiba in South Africa - appears to be virtually expressionless and does not seem to react to those around him.

He is wearing a flamboyant black and white shirt, with a white blanket covering his legs.

He looks thinner than usual and pale, with marks on his cheeks that appear to be from a recently removed oxygen mask.

But President Zuma insisted he was doing well.

Speaking on the doorstep of Mandela's home, he told SABC News: 'The doctors gave us a report and of 
course we saw him. He is looking very good, he is in good shape. We had 
some conversation with him, we shook hands, we smiled.

'As you can see he
 is really up and about and stablised. We're really very happy. We think that 
he is fine.'

Back home: Mandela spent 10 days in hospital earlier this month after coming down with pneumonia

In the video, Zuma jokes and laughs with two officials of the governing African National Congress, some Mandela family members and the former president's medical team, while Mandela stares straight ahead.

One of his grandsons cries 'Smile, smile,' as he takes a picture on his mobile phone. He attempts a weak smile but, as the flash goes off, he closes his eyes and purses his lips.

The former president is known to dislike camera flashes, as his eyes are sensitive after years of working in the glare of a limestone quarry when he was imprisoned on Robben Island.

In a statement, the ANC said Mandela was 'keenly 
aware of the goodwill that has been outpouring from the peoples of the 
globe as befitting his status as our icon'.

The Nobel Peace laureate was imprisoned for 27 years during the apartheid era became the first democratically elected president of South Africa in 1994.
