At just 14-years-old, Florida teen Jazz Jennings continues to do more for transgender advocacy than most.

Born male but first identifying as female from the age of two, the precocious eighth-grader was recently named one of TIME magazines 25 most-influential teenagers, alongside Taliban victim and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Malala Yousafzai.

Jazz has now released I Am Jazz, the first book that is aimed at helping children understand exactly what it means to be transgender, whether they are struggling with their identity or not.

'People see black and white, they don't see the rainbow in the world, and that's really closed-minded,' Jazz said in a new interview with Katie Couric for Yahoo!.

Personal: The book features experiences that happened to Jazz as she grew up living as female but physically male

'I get many emails from a lot of different kids.

'Some people even write that, without me, they would have killed themselves.

'One kid said that they were going to walk into a street full of cars, and they decided not to because they thought of Jazz.

'That shows me I'm doing the right thing by being here and I have to continue moving forward.'

Jazz said as a toddler he knew she wanted to be a girl and would unsnap her onsies to make it look like a dress.

If people called her a 'good boy' she would correct them, saying she was a good girl.

Her parents first decided to seek advice from a pediatrician when she was two years old, after she asked: 'Mommy, when's the good fairy going to come with her magic wand and change, you know, my genitalia?'

Three years later, after being diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder, or Gender Dysphoria, Jazz made the figurative transition from male to female.

It was her fifth birthday and her parents let her wear a rainbow-colored one-piece swimsuit.

She then grew her hair out, pierced her ears, and wore dresses everywhere - even to kindergarten.

Doctors prescribed blockers that prevented the growth of body hair and the development of other masculine characteristics as Jazz started to go through puberty.

Then an estrogen therapy will allow her body to go through a form of female puberty.

She will grow breasts and gain body fat around her hips.

Support: The eighth grader has a strong group of friends and family around her

Gorgeous: Jazz said she knew from very wrong that her gender was not a choice, but how she was born

The final step would be sex reassignment surgery, but most doctors will not perform this until the age of consent, 18.

With four years to go, Jazz is now focusing on how she can help others go through what she did.

I Am Jazz features the story of Jazz's journey to understanding her true, accompanied with illustrations.

'I have a girl brain but a boy body,' Jazz says in the book. 

'This is called transgender. I was born this way!'

The experiences continue, from that first doctors appointment, to the rainbow swimsuit, up to the problems she had a school over what bathroom to use.

Her school had insisted she go to the one in the nurse's office.

The project, along with all of Jazz's endeavors, has the full support of her family, especially mom Jeanette Jennings. 

'Trans kids are like other kids,' Jeanette told The Houston Chronicle last month.

Groundbreaking: I Am Jazz is believed to be the first book aimed at transgender children

'But a lot of times Jazz sits at lunch in school and people move away from her. 

'She's still a human being. 

'I'm hoping kids will embrace that. 

'Let's get to them before they hear the negativity, and it won't be a big deal. 

'Nobody says it's wrong to be autistic. 

'It isn't wrong to be transgender. 

'Being unique is pretty cool.'

All the proceeds from the book will go to the TransKids Purple Rainbow Foundation, which Jazz's mother and father, Greg, started in 2007 to support trans children and challenge discrimination against them.
