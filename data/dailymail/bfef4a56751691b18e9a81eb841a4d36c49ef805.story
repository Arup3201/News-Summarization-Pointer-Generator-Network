If you devour your Christmas dinner but can't bring yourself to sample the cook's Brussels's sprouts, you may now have an excuse: it's in your genes.

A chemistry teacher has created an infographic explaining the chemistry and genetics behind why some people can’t stand the taste of bitter vegetables.

Those who loathe the seasonal greens, Andy Brunning explains, may be especially sensitive to naturally occurring chemical compounds called glucosinolates.

Hate sprouts? You've got a new excuse: A chemistry teacher argues that there may be a chemical and genetic reason why some people can’t stand the taste of Brussels sprouts. People who loathe the seasonal green vegetables may be especially sensitive to chemical compounds called glucosinolates, which occur naturally in sprouts

The Bournemouth-based teacher, who runs the blog Compound Interest, explained that these compounds are broken down into chemicals called isothiocyanates when the vegetable is cooked. 

These compounds, while bitter to everyone, taste especially unpalatable to almost three quarters of humans.

A similar phenomenon is observed in a synthetic compound called Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), not found in sprouts, that tastes bitter to 70 per cent of people, while remaining tasteless to the remaining 30 per cent.

It was discovered when a chemist called Arthur Fox, who was working at DuPont in 1931, accidentally spilt some of the chemical. 

While it did not affect him, his colleague complained of a bitter taste, leading the scientists to not only discover that it only tastes bitter to some people, but that those that the ability to taste it is genetic.

Brussels sprouts contain the compound sulforaphane, a product of the glucosinolates.

While research is ongoing, studies suggest that sulforaphanes may protect against degenerative brain diseases and even cancer.

This compound is also responsible for the bitterness of overcooked vegetables and is being investigated for antioxidant properties. 

Similarly, another compound called propylthiouracil (PROP) only tastes bitter to certain people. 

Mr Brunning explained that while neither compound can be found in sprouts, they both contain a thiocyanate group in their molecular structures, which is thought to be related to their bitter taste. 

And the same group is found in glucosinolate compounds, which occur naturally in Brussels sprouts.

They are also found in broccoli, cabbage and kale, known as cruciferous vegetables. It’s thought they protect the plants against diseases and ward off insects that nibble on them.

Mr Brunning writes: ‘There seems to be a strong association between the ability to detect the bitter taste of PTC and PROP and a sensitivity to the bitterness of these vegetables,’ suggesting that the reason why some people find sprouts so unpleasant, may be genetic. 

‘It’s not the case that sensitivity to PTC and PROP automatically implies a dislike of cruciferous vegetables.

‘But if you’re a Brussels sprouts hater, you can now suggest a potential chemical reason for your dislike if you’re ever berated for your perceived vegetable prejudice.’ 

Brussels sprouts contain the compound sulforaphane, which is a product of the glucosinolates. 

While research is ongoing, it suggests that sulforaphanes may protect against neurodegenerative diseases and even cancer. 

This compound is also responsible for the bitterness of overcooked vegetables and is being investigate for its antioxidant properties.
