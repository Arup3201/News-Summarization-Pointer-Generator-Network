Katie Hopkins has sparked controversy once more by saying police officer Darren Wilson should 'get a medal' for shooting unarmed black teenager Michael Brown who she called 'a thief and a thug'.

The never-ending source of opinions took to Twitter to give her two cents on the Ferguson case after a grand jury decided not to indict officer Wilson over the killing.

Unsurprisingly, the reactions to Ms Hopkins' comments, posted to her 263,000 followers yesterday, did not take long.

Controversial: Katie Hopkins tweeted her support for police officer Darren Wilson for shooting Michael Brown, calling the dead 18-year-old 'a thief and a thug'

'Brown was not shot for being black. Brown was shot for being a thief and a thug. Give the officer a medal. Justice with knobs on,' Ms Hopkins wrote.

In response, several Twitter users accused Ms Hopkins of 'attention seeking', 'antagonizing', and trying too hard'. 

Ms Hopkins, whose post has been favourited 306 times and had 264 retweets so far, is not the first person to tweet her opinion on the controversial case. 

When the decision was announced on Monday, 3.5million tweets were posted about the ruling using #Ferguson in just a few hours.

When St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCullough announced the grand jury's conclusion that 'no probable cause exists' to indict Officer Darren Wilson at 8.30pm CT, around 52,200 tweets per minute were posted.

Earlier today, Officer Darren Wilson revealed that he believes he made the right choice to use lethal force against Michael Brown.

Wilson said that while he feels remorse for causing Brown's death, he would do it all over again.

'I don't think it's haunting; it's always going to be something that happened,'  the controversial cop said during an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos

'The reason I have a clear conscience is because I know I did my job right,' Wilson said.

Michael Brown's family reacted with anger on Wednesday, saying Wilson's interview added 'insult to injury'.

The teenager's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told CBS she didn't think Wilson wanted to kill Michael but that 'he wanted to kill someone'. 

Despite the St. Louis grand jury decision, federal investigations into the shooting of Michael Brown continue the US Attorney General Eric Holder said on Monday.

The Justice Department will continue to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson when he shot dead unarmed Brown in August this year, and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force.
