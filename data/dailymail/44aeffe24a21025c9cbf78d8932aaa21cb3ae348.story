Photobomb has been announced as the 2014 Word of the Year after seeing off competition from 50,000 new additions to the dictionary that include twerk, bakeoff and normcore.

While it has been referred to as far back as 2008, the photobomb received a powerful endorsement from Prince Harry and the Queen this year when they were both pictured photobombing athletes at the Commonwealth Games.

The photobomb is officially defined by the Collins English Dictionary as 'to intrude into the background of a photograph without the subject's knowledge'.

Although the photobomb has been practiced - as it's currently known - since at least 2008, a string of high profile photobombs this year rocketed it into position as the number one Word of the Year.

Publisher Collins explained its decision to coincide with the release of the 12th edition of its English Dictionary.

'The first recording of the word is in 2008 as the subject of a Google search and it gained wider use in 2012 when a number of photographs exhibiting the phenomenon went viral on the web.

'This year saw an unprecedented level of high-profile photobombing, most notable were Jennifer Lawrence photobombing Taylor Swift at the Golden Globes in January, Benedict Cumberbatch photobombing U2 at the Oscars, and the Queen, who unwittingly photobombed members of the Australian hockey team at the Commonwealth Games.

'Her grandsons took a more direct approach with Prince William photobombing Sir Chris Hoy and Prince Harry photobombing the New Zealand rugby coach.' 

Collins claimed this year had seen an 'unprecedented level' of photobombing, including the Royals' antics at the Games and film stars hijacking each other's photographs at red carpet events.

Ian Brookes, a consultant lexicographer for Collins English Dictionary, said the high-profile photobombs made it the undeniable Word of the Year.

He said: 'We had been tracking 'photobomb' for a couple of years but were not sure that it would become widely established.

'It's vastly increased prominence in 2014 shows the power of media and sporting events to publicize a word and bring it into wider use.'

It comes as the 12th edition of the Collins English Dictionary is released with 50,000 words receiving a seal of approval and becoming an official part of the English language.

1. Photobomb: To intrude into the background of a photograph without the subject's knowledge.

2. Tinder: The dating app Tinder matches users in their local area, who swipe right to like a profile and left to reject it.

3. Bakeoff: A baking competition.

4. Normcore: A trend in fashion emphasizing the practical and/or ordinary.

5. Devo Max: An arrangement in which a central government transfers the maximum amount of authority to a regional government while still retaining sovereignty over it.

And whether you love it or loathe it, Miley Cyrus' twerking has been accepted.

Twerking, in which a dancer gyrates in a sexually provocative manner, has been popularised by pop star Cyrus in the past few years.

Another notable new addition is adorkable, a blend of adorable and dork, and which is defined as someone socially inept in a charming way.

However, photobomb was the winner in a shortlist of five words which rose to prominence this year.

In second place was Tinder, the mobile dating app which shows users profiles of people within their area and matches the two - enabling them to chat if they indicate a mutual interest in one another.

In third place was bakeoff. Although Collins cites use of the word as far back as 1949 when a flour company in Minneapolis, U.S., launched a baking competition, its popularity skyrocketed when The Great British Bakeoff first aired in 2010.

In fourth and fifth places were normcore and devo max, respectively.
