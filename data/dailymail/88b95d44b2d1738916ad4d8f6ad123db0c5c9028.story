Alex Salmond was left reeling last night as a new poll revealed a surge in support for the Union amid growing anger over his support for Vladimir Putin.

The bruised First Minister gave a woeful display in Holyrood as he was blasted by all three opposition leaders for his glowing comments about the Russian president.

At the end of one of the toughest weeks for the SNP leader in recent months - including branding Scotland a 'nation of drunks - a new poll was also published which found that Better Together has recorded a dramatic 16-point lead over the Yes campaign.

Among those expressing a preference, 58 per cent said they would vote against Scottish independence, with only 42 backing it in a YouGov poll for Channel 4 News

With undecided voters stripped out from the figures, the YouGov study put support for the Union at 58 per cent, with backing for separation languishing on just 42 per cent.

That is a far cry from a recent ICM poll which put Yes on 48 per cent and No on 52 per cent, and suggests any momentum for Mr Salmond’s campaign has come to a shuddering halt.

It is also a major humiliation for SNP strategists who privately told journalists they could draw level in the polls as early as this week.

However, the importance of persuading pro-Union Scots to cast their votes on September 18 became clear yesterday, as a study found that supporters of independence are far more likely to turn out.

Their greater appetite could boost the final Yes tally by 2 per cent, which could be pivotal in a close race.

The poll is a devastating blow for Alex Salmond after one of his worst ever weeks

Record numbers of Scots have now registered to vote, including 80 per cent of 16 and 17-year-olds.

The new YouGov poll for Channel 4 News involved surveying 1,208 Scots between Friday, April 25, and Monday, April 28.

It came at the end of a week when Labour had ‘stamped its mark all over the referendum debate’ with leader Ed Miliband bringing his Shadow Cabinet to Glasgow and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown appearing under the Better Together banner for the first time.

Then, on Monday, it emerged Mr Salmond had told GQ magazine that he admires ‘certain aspects’ of Putin’s politics.

The Russian president has effectively outlawed homosexuality, defended the Syrian government’s attacks on its own people, and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea before claiming it for Russia.

But, while Mr Salmond said he does not approve of a ‘range of Russian actions’, he added: ‘He’s restored a substantial part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing.’

His comments sparked worldwide condemnation from groups such as Amnesty International, while the SNP leader received unwanted support from the Kremlin and pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk.

In the same interview, while discussing promoting whisky when abroad, Mr Salmond said: ‘My argument is that if you are promoting it as authentic and of great worth, you cannot promote it from a nation of drunks.’

Mr Salmond has stubbornly refused to apologise to Ukrainians, and again flatly turned down the opportunity to say sorry during First Minister’s Questions yesterday.

Observers agreed that it was one of the worst performances by Mr Salmond in the chamber for months.

His front bench looked uncomfortable as Labour leader Johann Lamont told him: ‘The reputation of the people of Scotland has been damaged.’

Scots families would pay more for mortgages and credit cards in an independent Scotland, an influential ratings agency has warned.

Moody’s said separation would leave Scotland at least two notches below the rest of the UK, pushing up the cost of borrowing and leaving people worse off.

It has also delivered a hammer blow to Alex Salmond’s hopes of sharing the pound by saying it would be bad for the rest of the UK.

However, it admits such an outcome is ‘unlikely’ as the main parties have all ruled out a currency union following a Yes vote.

The findings reinforce the gloomy predictions for an independent Scotland previously made by the likes of Fitch and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).

Fitch, one of the other top ratings agencies, warned the SNP plans for a ‘currency union’ with the rest of the UK could lead to ‘high volatility and market turbulence’ in December.

And earlier this month, NIESR said Scotland’s annual debt repayments to the rest of the UK, including interest, would be a crippling £23billion.

First Minister Alex Salmond has said Scotland could walk away from the UK debt if it is not allowed to join a currency union. And Joan MacAlpine, SNP MSP, made the bizarre claim that Scotland’s credit rating would be higher than the UK’s.

That was dismissed by Moody’s yesterday.

It said: ‘The most likely scenario is that Scotland would be rated somewhere in the middle of investment grade, though at least two notches below the UK's rating.

‘An A rating is the most likely at the outset, but with risks of a different outcome tilted to the downside.' 

It also backed the UK Government’s decision to rule out sharing the pound following a Yes vote.

‘If Scotland were to retain the pound sterling as its currency and the Bank of England as its central bank, this would be credit negative for the remainder of the UK,’ Moody’s said.

The findings were seized upon by the pro-union campaign who said they deal a further blow to the nationalists’ faltering economic case for independence.

Alistair Darling, the leader of Better Together, said: ‘This is an absolutely devastating report for the nationalists.'

Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish 
Liberal Democrats, said: ‘The First Minister wants us to stand tall in 
the world, but does he not just look small?’

Ruth Davidson, Scottish Conservative leader, said the First Minister ‘continues to make poorly timed and badly judged interventions on foreign affairs’.

She added: ‘How can we trust the First Minister to represent Scotland on the global stage when he so consistently gets it wrong?’

Mr Salmond’s only defence was to weakly refer to a £500,000 donation to Better Together from businessman Ian Taylor last year, and to claim that he was referring to the Sochi Winter Olympics when he spoke of Russian ‘pride’.

‘The position that we have put forward has been consistent and balanced,’ he said.

‘It shows that we do not approve of Russian actions and consists of comments that are reasonable in the circumstances, and we back that up by the action that we have taken.’

Afterwards his top spin doctor bizarrely claimed the criticism was not borne out of concern for the people of Ukraine, or Scotland’s global image, but was part of a Better Together conspiracy.

His remarks were reminiscent of Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill’s widely derided claim that criticism of his plan to abolish legal safeguards was also a pro-Union plot.

The First Minister’s spokesman said there was a ‘coordinated political attack by opponents sensing an opportunity that has nothing to do with the situation in Ukraine’.

Meanwhile, the new YouGov poll was welcomed by Better Together last night.

‘This poll is yet another sign that our campaign speaks for the majority of Scots who want Scotland to remain a proud member of the UK,’ a spokesman said.

However, researchers at social research institute ScotCen found that the proportion of Yes voters who are more than 50 per cent likely to take part in the referendum is four percentage points higher than the equivalent proportion for No supporters.

Among undecided voters, 91 per cent of those leaning towards Yes are more than 50 per cent likely to vote, compared with 73 per cent leaning towards No.

A spokesman for Better Together said: ‘This analysis shows that everyone who believes that we are stronger and better together as part of the UK has to campaign for it and they have to vote for it. This is the biggest decision that we will ever take as a nation. It is too important to leave to other people.’

A Yes Scotland spokesman said: ‘The success of the campaign so far lies in the fact that hundreds of thousands of people have found no difficulty in finding the motivation to fight for a Yes vote.’

The SNP claimed that support for separation is at its highest level in YouGov polls, and business convener Derek Mackay insisted the race is still ‘neck and neck’.
