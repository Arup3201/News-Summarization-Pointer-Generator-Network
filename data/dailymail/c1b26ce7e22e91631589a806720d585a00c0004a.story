A New South Wales MP's latest attempt to ban the burqa across the state has been branded anti-Islamic and a political stunt.

Christian Democratic Party leader Fred Nile introduced his private member's bill in state parliament on Thursday that would prohibit the wearing of the burqa and other face coverings in public.

It follows similar bans in Belgium and France, and comes after his failed attempt at blacklisting face coverings in 2010.

Christian Democratic Party MP Fred Nile has introduced a bill that would see the ban of burqas

While Mr Nile stressed that his bill's text did not include the words 'burqa' or 'Muslim', much of his speech to parliament about the plan focused on the burqa.

He said the measures came at an 'opportune' time after Wednesday's arrest in Queensland of two men allegedly linked to terrorist groups in Syria.

'We also face the new Islamic State (IS) terrorist threat, whose black uniforms for both men and women include face coverings to prevent identification,' he told the upper house.

Labor MP Amanda Fazio said the measures were 'anti-Islamic' and had more to do with Mr Nile's bid for re-election in March.

His political opponents, like Labor MP Amanda Fazio, said the measures were 'anti-Islamic'

'These measures are the opposite of everything we're trying to achieve in Australia in terms of being inclusive and having a harmonious society where we respect difference,' she told AAP.

Silma Ihram, from Australian Muslim Women's Association, branded the move as 'unfortunate'.

'[This] is only going to further traumatise members of the [Muslim] community who are absolutely innocent and have every right to wear the fashion of their choice," she said.

Under Mr Nile's plan, a person who covers their face in public would face a $550 fine and a person who forces someone else to cover their face would be hit with a $1,100 penalty.

The plan allows faces to be covered under certain conditions, such as during a parade or if 'Sydney is suddenly hit by a blizzard and ski masks are the latest fashion', the MP said.

Greens MP Mehreen Faruqi said the move was another example of 'conservative men trying to control what women do'.

Mr Nile's move comes after two Queensland men, Agim Kruezi (left) and Omar Succrieh (right) were arrested for charges of terrorism 

John Blaxland, an intelligence and security expert at the Australian National University, said authorities already had powers to ask for face coverings to be removed.

He said Mr Nile's plan was unlikely to be supported by the security community.

Comment has been sought from NSW Premier Mike Baird.

Debate on the bill was adjourned.

It comes as two Queensland men were charged on Wednesday for preparing to send fighters to join the conflict in Syria after a raid on a Islamic bookstore, a gym and seven other premises in Logan and Brisbane.

The arrests followed a year-long counter-terrorism investigation by Australian Federal Police and state police.

Omar Succarieh, who is the brother of Australia's first suicide bomber to die in Syria, was charged with providing funds to the terrorist organisation Jabhat al-Nusra.

The 31-year-old, from Kuraby, was also charged with preparing for incursions into Syria.

Further, Agim Kruezi, 21, from Boronia Heights, was charged with preparing for incursions into Syria with the intention of engaging in hostile activities as well as recruiting fighters to join the conflict.
