An armoury of more than 40 deadly firearms and weapons including a 5ft long air force missile have been discovered by police at a pensioner's home.

Harry Jones, 76, who’s secretary of a gun club, claims the collection of weapons is just a hobby.

Officers uncovered the hoard of weapons, most of which date from the First and Second World Wars,  at the suburban home of the elderly collector in Dukinfield, Manchester.

Jones was arrested on 
suspicion of possessing a prohibited firearm following the police search last week, and has since been bailed 
pending further police investigation.

Mr Jones told the Manchester Evening News that he was a weapons 'enthusiast'.

'This has been grossly exaggerated,' he said.

'I’m not criticising the police. I’ve been very well treated.'

Mr Jones was arrested on July 9 while attending a meeting of the Tameside Shooting Sports Association, which is affiliated to the controversial National Rifle Association in the US and the Muzzle Loaders Association of Britain.

Officers then raided his home and Greater Manchester Police say over 40 prohibited weapons were recovered.

Mr Jones has since been bailed pending further inquiries.

However, officers have warned that there could have been serious consequences if the weapons, including shells, missiles, guns and ammunition, had fallen into the wrong hands.

More than 40 prohibited weapons have been
 seized and they are in the process of being examined by specialist officers 
under the Firearms Act.

Among their number was a First World war artillery shell and the large grey missile, which has 'Air Force FA-770' painted onto it, and is thought to have been designed to be released by a fighter aircraft.

'We have recovered a significant number of firearms at this address, many of which appear to be antique or heritage weapons relating to the World Wars,' said Detective Chief Inspector Debbie Dooley, from Greater Manchester Police.

'At this stage the weapons do not appear to have been collected for any other reason than as part of a hobby but it does not detract from the seriousness that these weapons pose, particularly if they get into the wrong hands.'

Police said that many firearms are held by people who are ignorant of their illegality, or have been left in homes and forgotten about.

Fear: It is believed the collector had amassed the weapons store as a hobby, but officers have warned that there could have been serious consequences if the weapons, including shells, missiles, guns and ammunition, had fallen into the wrong hands

The force is running an amnesty, which began on Saturday and will run until 11.59pm on Saturday, July 26 for people to surrender unwanted or unlicensed weapons.

During that period, those surrendering
 firearms will not face prosecution for the illegal possession and they 
can remain anonymous.

During
 the amnesty there will also be a change in legislation which will make 
it illegal for certain people to hold weapons such as antique firearms.

DCI Dooley added: 'Greater Manchester Police is holding a gun amnesty over the next two weeks and I would urge members of the public to surrender unlawfully held or unwanted guns and ammunition.

'Give up the gun before we come and search your home.'
