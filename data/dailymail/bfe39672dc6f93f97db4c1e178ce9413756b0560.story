The view from Tim and Sheila Wilmot’s bedroom window is, frankly, rather astonishing.

Palm trees as high as houses sway in the breeze, 15ft banana trees stand firm, Chinese windmill palms droop with huge clusters of green and purple seeds.

There are enormous spiky agave plants, money trees the size of small bears, a 5ft bird of paradise.

The air is sweet and hot and damp. You can hear water tinkling in the distance.

All that’s missing is a troop of screaming monkeys swinging from liana to liana and a venomous snake or two. Vast ferns rustle in the shade - is that a tiger breaking cover?

No, of course not. Don’t be so silly.

Because Tim, 56, and Sheila, 60, don’t actually live anywhere near the Amazon rainforest, deep in the Congo or even in a particularly tropical spot of the Mediterranean.

Home is a modern detached house in the sprawling commuter village of Yate, on the outskirts of Bristol, 50 yards from a thundering bypass.

Neighbouring gardens boast neatly clipped lawns, conservatories, rose beds and nylon washing lines. But Tim, who runs his own software company, prefers things a bit more tropical.

‘I don’t know why. It’s a good question. I’ve never lived in the tropics. I’ve never lived abroad. I wasn’t even particularly interested in gardening when I was growing up,’ he says.

Ready for action: Tim poses above with a pair of garden shears. He spends hours every day tending to his array of plants, which hail from all over the world

Could you guess? From the front Tim Wilmot's home in Yate, not far from Bristol and yards from a thundering bypass - looks like any other home

‘But 20 or 30 years ago we’d go on summer holidays and I’d spend all my time looking at jelly palms and Canary Island palms and think: “Wow! I’d love one of those in my garden. One day...” ’

The Wilmot family moved in when son Max, now 25, was still a baby, Toby, now 21, wasn’t even a glint in the eye and the garden was, well, just as you’d expect a suburban garden to be.

Nice big patio, beech hedge, leylandii, apple trees, decent stretch of grass, a bright orange Ronsealed fence, ornamental pagoda and not a banana tree or shrieking chimpanzee in sight.

‘It was fine for a bit. But no one else in the family is into gardening, so I just sort of started doing my own thing. I didn’t ask permission,’ says Tim.

He is a self-taught amateur gardener. But, bit by bit, with the help of gardening books, information from the internet and trial and error, he transformed this quarter of an acre into looking like a painting by Henri Rousseau.

Down came the beech hedge and the apple trees and the pagoda. The leylandii were ripped up and replaced with a bamboo plantation.

In went jelly palms from South America, banana trees, ferns, ornamental cacti, yuccas, succulents, gunneras (which looks a bit like monster prehistoric spiky rhubarb) and rice paper plants.

‘I had a few tropical plants in our last garden, but they were all in pots and just waiting to be let loose.’

Once unleashed, they must have gone mad. Because today everything is massive, enormous, jungle-sized.

The banana leaves are like sails. The foliage of the gunnera measures six foot across. The rice paper plant leaves are the size of coffee tables.

Hours' work: Tim spends more than two hours every day watering his garden during dry spells - and has luckily never been hit by a hose-pipe ban

Despite his modesty, maintaining a jungle garden on the outskirts of Bristol isn’t simply a combination of gentle pruning and swinging like Tarzan through the foliage. ‘It’d be easier in London or down in the South-West - we’re in a frost pocket here.’

So during winter, Tim spends hours hunched over his own weather station checking for cold snaps and high winds, erecting vast home-made polytunnels made of curved drainpipes and polythene over his prized agaves (from sunny Mexico) and lovingly wrapping his tender palms and bananas in horticultural fleece. ‘I get very twitchy when it’s cold. I’ll be out there at three in the morning in my dressing gown, putting extra layers of fleece on.’

He also spreads ten bales of straw round the bases of the banana plants, builds plant shelters and decants the pot plants into a purpose-built greenhouse.

This sounds a breeze, until you remember that many are 10ft and weigh half-a-ton each.

‘It takes three days with the help of Max to get them all in. They hate the cold, so I have a fan heater going to keep the temperature above three or four degrees.’

Humble roots: Mr Wilmot's gardening ambitions began with a few humble palm trees, but became more audacious over time

Then, come spring, he has to reverse the whole process, hoping and praying no lasting damage has been done.

‘It’s only in the spring you can tell if the palm trees are OK. They’re still green, but the central spear will go mushy and collapse. It’s very sad.

‘I have vision of how it should all look and then I end up with a blank spot in the garden. I’m very critical and I want everything to be perfect.’

Does Sheila get irritated, what with him buzzing in and out all night in his pyjamas, fussing over the palms?

‘Yes. I tend to get a bit engrossed and everything I do in the garden takes twice as long as I tell her it will.

‘But I think she minds more in the summer, when we could be going out for the evening and I’m busy watering.’

And watering, and watering.

During a dry spell, he’ll spend at least two hours a night watering. ‘You could put a hose-pipe on a banana all day and they’d lap it up. They could live in water.’

Perfectionist: Tim admits to spending hours more than planed in his garden - and has reached the point where it is so full there is no extra room unless something dies

Happily, the Wilmots’ house was built in 1988, just before water meters were introduced.

But what about hose-pipe bans?

‘We’ve never had a hose-pipe ban here, only a sprinkler ban. But I’ve got a well and a pump for emergencies.’ Over the years, there have been disasters - ‘I’ve had terrible losses with my tender palms’ - and triumphs.

‘It’s a very big moment when one of the banana trees produces a banana - you can’t eat them, of course. They’re small and there’s no flesh in them. But the flower! Ah, it’s a Triffid-like flower. It’s very exciting.’

Tim’s garden has won endless prizes, been featured in magazines and BBC TV’s Gardeners’ World and is open to the public every year as part of the National Gardens Scheme (the next open day is Sunday, September 14). And today, finally, after 25 years of hard work, it is finished.

‘It’s done, it’s full. To be honest, it’s a bit of a relief. I can’t fit anything else in, so it’s a one-in-one-out system when something dies.’

And, rude question, but what about the cost of it all?

Extensive: Much of the garden, pictured in the height of summer, is packed away in colder months

Exotic: The puya plant, pictured, originally comes from the mountainous Andres, but can survive in Bristol

Vibrant: Mr WIlmot's plants, such as this golden bamboo, are usually found thousands of miles away

‘People always go on and on about the money, but I don’t think it’s that much - £10,000 altogether. 

You could spend that on a golf club subscription. It’s a hobby and it’s exercise, so it’s good value for money. And all my family get to enjoy it, too. We even had the sitting room windows made bigger so we could all see it better.’

But what if they ever move?

‘I’ll have to leave the plants behind. Maybe I’d donate some to Kew Gardens for their hot house.’ The garden would not appeal to everyone. Today there’s just teeny scrap of lawn left. Barely space for a washing line. The tropical plants dominates totally and utterly.

But it is magnificent. The views from the house are extraordinary. Sit on their sofa and it really feels as if you’re in a jungle.

The only thing missing is colour.

‘There’s loads of colour! It’s all colour!’ he says, outraged.

But it’s all green. What about flowers? A rose or two or clematis?

Tim shudders. ‘I see no attraction in roses or clematis. None whatsoever. They get diseases, they need lots of attention and everyone else is growing them. What’s the point?’

And what about the neighbours?

‘They don’t seem to be that into gardening. But I have noticed the odd bamboo springing up. And more palm trees.

‘Maybe it’ll catch on and in 30 years this whole area will be one big jungle.’
