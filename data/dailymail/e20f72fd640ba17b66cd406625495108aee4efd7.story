The boarding house where Lee Harvey Oswald was staying at the time he assassinated President John F. Kennedy has gone on sale - and remains virtually untouched since that fateful day.

His snug single bedroom at 1026 North Beckley in Dallas, Texas appears exactly as it did when he used an assumed name and stayed as a guest in November 1963 - bar a change of sheets.

The home's owner, whose grandmother ran the boarding house 50 years ago, is selling the modest property for $500,000, and hopes it will be kept as a museum or used as a bed and breakfast.

Oswald stayed in the 5-by-14 room for three weeks while working a new job at the Texas School Book Depository and he paid $8 each week for his room, the living room and refrigerator privileges.

On the weekends he returned to Irving where his wife and young children lived.

Owner Patricia Hall 
was just 11 when Oswald lived at the house, but remembers his stay - 
even though there was nothing very memorable about the man, she said.

'He was just a regular guy,' Hall told CBS News. 'My grandmother appreciated the fact that he kept his room neat and clean, that he didn't monopolize the bathroom.'

After he assassinated the president, who was traveling by motorcade through the city on November 22, 1963, he reportedly ran to the home, grabbed some items and left without saying a word.

When Hall's grandmother, Gladys Johnson, learned of his plot - and endured relentless door knocks from reporters and death threats in the aftermath - she scrubbed his name from the home's records.

'She was scared, humiliated,' Hall said. 'And, in 
fact, she even destroyed the sign-in sheets showing that he had paid his
 rent. She just wanted to erase him.'

Place to stay: Hall said she remembers Oswald as being a considerate boarder and an ordinary man

Hall said that her grandmother, who initially conducted interviews and posed in the sparse room for photographers, eventually refused to answer the door to reporters.

But what irked her most was the police investigation, Hall said. She recounted how officers entered the home and tersely grabbed the sheets and other items before leaving.

'My grandmother harbored the fact that she never got her sheets back until the day she died,' Hall said. 'Seriously. Not because they were historic, but because those were fairly new sheets and she could have used those on other beds.'

The family briefly relented to allow Oliver Stone to film scenes for his 1991 movie, JFK.

Apart from the change of sheets, the small room is largely unchanged. The rest of the home also still bears fixtures and furniture that were at the home in the 1960s.

The family briefly relented to allow 
Oliver Stone to film scenes for his 1991 movie, JFK. In 2009, Hall began
 opening the door to anyone who wanted to look around.

But she said that she is now looking forward to someone else taking on the home.

'At
 this time in my life I feel like I have to be practical,' she told CBS.
 'Maybe there's someone else that might be a better steward.'

Lee
 Harvey Oswald, 24, assassinated President Kennedy on November 22, 1963,
 in downtown Dallas. He then fatally shot Officer J.D. Tippit and was 
arrested at the Texas Theatre in the city.

Two
 days later, as Oswald was being transferred from his holding cell to the 
county jail, a Dallas nightclub owner, Jack Ruby, shot him dead.

Unchanged: Since 2009, Hall has opened the doors to the public wishing to see inside the home

The 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination has been gaining attention in recent months as everyone from museum curators to musicians have embarked on projects to remember the event.

Among recent events, Oswald's ex-wife, Marina Oswald Porter, now 72, is putting his wedding ring up for auction as she breaks the final ties to what she describes as the 'worst day of my life'.

She hopes that the ring, which was found in a manila envelope in an attorney's office nine years ago, will fetch $50,000 at auction in New Hampshire.

The city of Dallas will hold a commemoration November 22 in Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy's motorcade was passing as shots rang out.
