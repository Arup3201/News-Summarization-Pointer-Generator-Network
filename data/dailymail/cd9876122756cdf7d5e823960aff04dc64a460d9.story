There are at least 10 serious threats at Australian airports reported each day and many of them are terror-related alerts, as our Border Protection and Customs officials react to government directives to heightened national security measures.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has made the claims this morning, as he outlined more details of the Border Protection anti-terror units being deployed across the country.

Mr Morrison confirmed to Sky News that there are 80 additional officers being placed into shift arrangements across Australia's capital city airports.

Federal Police patrol Melbourne Airport as the Immigration Minister admits there are '10 serious threats at Australian airports every day' including terror alerts

Scott Morrison says counter-terrorism units are being deployed to Australian airports to stop 'the risk of foreign fighters'

'They are there to do one job - and that is to address this particular threat, which is proposed through counter-terrorism and particularly the risk of foreign fighters,' Mr Morrison said.

'What's more important is the strength that is already there needs to keep doing the job they do every day on the broad range of threats that already exist.

'We get 10 serious alerts every day at our airports all round the country and so that means we need that force to focus fairly on that and squarely on that and this additional force to come in and supplement so that we can ensure that the issues in the past don't reoccur, like the Khaled Sharrouf case.'

Up to 80 Border Protection team members will supplement the likes of Federal Police and Customs officials across international airports in Australia

Sharrouf was able to flee Australia last December on his brother's passport, despite having been convicted of a terrorist conspiracy in 2005.

Mr Morrison's revelations follow the arrest of a suspected terrorist bound for Syria at Melbourne Airport after Customs officials allegedly found him carrying images of beheadings and the ISIL flag.

The man, who is believed to be an Australian citizen, was allegedly also carrying $30,000 and was with three family members, when he was detained on a flight travelling to Beirut.

Another man was arrested at Sydney Airport on Sunday after material related to the Islamic State was found in his luggage.

'We've had one, we've had others as well over the course of the past few months,' Mr Morrison admitted.

It's been confirmed at least five people have now been arrested by the counter-terrorism units for carrying either 'large sums of cash or objectional material,' according to Mr Morrison.
