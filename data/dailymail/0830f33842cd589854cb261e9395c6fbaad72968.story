A father became so fed up with his garden being damaged by wayward footballs he invented an innovative new goal.

Jonathan Cowan, 47, of Watford, Hertfordshire, despaired after kickabouts in his garden led to broken greenhouses, plants and annoyed neighbours.

Youngsters pretending to be Wayne Rooney on the lawn cause damage costing £94million each year, research reveals.

Now Mr Cowan has come up with a solution - a goal with a vast backstop net that prevents stray balls from going over and wide.

Saved: 'Open Goaaal' is a net that sits behind the goal and catches mis-hit strikes, preventing damage

Research found the average family spends £71 a year fixing household items damaged by stray footballs

The net of the 'Open Goaaal' stretches between two poles and can be tailored depending on size of the garden.

The company's study found the average family spends £71 a year fixing household items damaged by stray footballs.

And over a fifth (22 per cent) of people have been forced to fix damaged goods in the last year.

Windows came top of the list of items hit by stray balls.

Also making the top five list were fences, plants and trees, outdoor lights and BBQs.

Mr Cowan said: 'There's barely a parent around who won't grimace at the mention of footballs and gardens.

'Ruining the plants, destroying the fence or annoying the neighbours - there are plenty of reasons and the repair bills pile up.'

Mr Cowan's daughter, Tabitha, 13, was his inspiration as she grew up playing in their back garden and signed with Arsenal ladies at the age of 11.

He added: 'We reckon that with more of our backstop goals in people's gardens there's still hope for the England football teams of the future.

'Who knows where the product could lead, I think it could go as far as improving the standards of football in the UK as it makes garden football more acceptable.

'It might even help nurture the best England team we've ever seen!'

He said: 'The most embarrassing moment for us had to be when Tabitha fired the ball straight into our neighbour's greenhouse.

'The glass roof was completely smashed and we had to replace it all, it was just awful - we could't stop apologising.

'Luckily, they've forgiven us now.'

The greenhouse incident sparked Mr Cowan into action.

He said: 'We hung netting across the back of the garden on a wire. It was perfect - every time Tabitha missed the goal the netting would catch it.

'We wouldn't have to worry about it causing any damage.

'When we were finished we could just pull the net back across, out of sight.

'I've heard all sorts of awful feuds between neighbours, including our friend's neighbours knifing each football that fell over the fence, before returning it completely deflated.

'I do hope this can put a stop to all of that, and the kids can just relax, and enjoy playing football in the garden.'

The ‘Open Goaaal’ is available from £119.
