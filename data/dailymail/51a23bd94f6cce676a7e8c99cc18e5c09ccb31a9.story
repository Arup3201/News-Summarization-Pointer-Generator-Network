He said: 'If players that played 90 minutes two days ago were fantastic, I expect people who are not playing a lot to raise the level to create me problems.

'I love problems of choices, and it is easy to choose my team for Saturday.'

Asked specifically if Schurrle and Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah had disappointed him, Mourinho replied: 'Yes.'
