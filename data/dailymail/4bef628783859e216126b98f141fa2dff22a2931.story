When 77-year-old Ike Herrick had a heart attack nearly 30 years ago, he made a bold decision - to walk his way to good health. 

After doctors ordered the then 50-year-old to drastically change his life or lose it, Herrick began  walking every day and measuring the distance.

The Texas man resolved to walk 21,477 miles - equivalent to crossing the world - over 27 years.

He finally reached his goal on Thursday and believes having a heart attack saved his life.

What a workout! Ike Herrick, 77, has achieved his goal of walking 21,477 miles - the equivalent of walking around the world - on a treadmill

Super fit: When Ike Herrick had a heart attack at age 50, he jumped on the treadmill in a bid to get healthy

'In my case, my heart attack was the best thing that could’ve ever happened to me because it awakened me to the fact that something was wrong, and would eventually kill me,' Herrick told KXAN.com.

'You don’t have to kill yourself 
exercising, but you gotta have cardio exercise to get your heart rate up
 every day. It’ll allow you to live a lot longer than 
you would otherwise.'

For years before his heart attack in 1987, doctors warned Herrick to change his diet and exercise routine because he was overweight, had high cholesterol, and a family history of heart disease.

His father died when he was just 51, while his brother and sister have both undergone bypass surgery.

'Being 50-years-old, I thought I was bullet proof,' Herrick told KHOU.com.

Lasting friendship: Dr George Rodgers, a cardiologist (left), treated Herrick (right) at Houston's Methodist Hospital and ordered him to begin exercising

When his heart stopped, Herrick was rushed to Houston’s Methodist Hospital where he met cardiologist George Rodgers, who was just beginning his fellowship.

'He
 told me he had the ‘ah-ha’ moment,' Dr Rodgers told KHOU.com.

'He said, ‘I’m too 
young to have a heart attack. I don’t want it to all end here'.'

On the advice of Dr Rodgers and other doctors, Herrick turned his life around and began walking at least three miles a day.

'What really
 struck me was when I when was in cardiac rehab, doctors really lectured
 us and emphasized the importance of eating right and getting enough 
exercise. One of the patients raised their hand and asked, ‘doctor, what
 if we don’t do this?'' Herrick said. 'The doctor said, ‘you will die'.'

Herrick
 stopped eating fast food, eliminated greasy, fried foods and cut down on his red meat intake. 

In
 the early 1990’s, Dr Rodgers moved to Austin to start his practice with 
the Seton Heart Institute about the same time Herrick and his wife moved
 to Lakeway. 

It was after walking 18,000 miles that Herrick decided to 'walk around the world'.

He calculated from Austin’s 30 degree latitude and realized he was 3,477 miles away from the equivalent of walking around the globe.

'I said, 'That’s an achievable goal if I can live to the age of 77,'  he said. 'My achievable goal was three miles a day, 15 miles a week or 700 miles a year.'

Herrick said it took two treadmills, two cardiologists and about 20 pairs of sneakers to attain his goal, with Dr Rodgers saying his patient's exercise regime has reduced his risk of dying from another heart attack by 25 percent. 

The sky's the limit: Herrick, 77, turned his life around after he had a heart attack at 50

Fearless: Herrick fully committed to his healthy lifestyle, saying, 'You don't have to kill yourself exercising, but you gotta have cardio exercise to get your heart rate up every day'
