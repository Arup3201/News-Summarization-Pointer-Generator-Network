Andy Murray says he will have studied some videos ahead of his match against Rafael Nadal and I am pretty certain what three of those showreels will have been.

One will have been the first set he played against the Spaniard in last month’s Italian Open quarter-finals, which he won 6-1 and was, in my view, the best tennis Andy has ever played on clay.

Two others will be the most recent victories of Novak Djokovic over Nadal — in April’s Miami final and the Italian final two weeks last Sunday. These were masterclasses in how to beat the world No 1.

The orthodox wisdom has been that the best way to play the great Spaniard is to go more to his backhand, but that has changed in my view and Djokovic, who has beaten him in their past four meetings, has had a lot of success hitting hard to Nadal’s supposedly stronger forehand side.

Over the years, Nadal’s backhand has become an incredibly solid shot, partly because he is a natural right-hander. His defence is phenomenal on that wing.

Another factor is that Rafa’s biggest weapon of all is the ‘inside-out’ forehand he hits when running around his backhand — these are both good reasons not to overdo the hitting towards that side of the court.

Murray has to take the ball on in the way he did in Rome. At times in that match he really hurt Nadal with his backhand and by hitting hard and flat to him on both sides. It was a contest he could have won.

I also think you will see the Scot use 
the drop shot more than he did against Gael Monfils, who gets fired up 
chasing into the net.

I have really enjoyed watching Andy over the past two weeks and this is the first time I have seen him with his ‘mojo’ back since Wimbledon.

There have been spells here when he has played superb clay-court tennis, with his movement outstanding and that backhand better than ever. Whatever the result today I think it will put him in extremely good shape for the grass-court season.

Can he beat Nadal? I do not sense any great vulnerability in the Spaniard, although his serve has not been quite as strong as previously. Clearly he is the solid favourite but if Andy manages to dictate for long enough then he has a chance.

A word of warning is that if the predicted hot weather materialises that is good for Rafa, as it will add zip and bounce to his ground-strokes.
