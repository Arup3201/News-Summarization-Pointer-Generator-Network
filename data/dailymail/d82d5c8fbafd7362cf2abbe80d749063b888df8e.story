Christmas tragedy: Markell Beasley, six, died of gunshot wounds on Christmas Eve

Beasley was not Markell's biological father and had no legal rights to the boy, but had a previous relationship with the mother and had been involved in raising the child, according to police.

Michelle Gelling told Jefferson City police she let the boy go to St. Louis on Saturday for what she was told would be a Christmas gathering.

Gelling later learned that there was no gathering and that the relatives had turned Markell over to Beasley, the newspaper reported.

In a series of text messages and phone calls, Beasley told Gelling he would not return her son, police said. He also made threatening statements toward anyone who might try to take the child from him.

Authorities issued an endangered child advisory Tuesday but later upgraded it to an Amber Alert as prosecutors in Jefferson City charged Beasley with kidnapping.

Beasley told Gelling during their exchanges that, 'God would see Markell before she would,' investigators said in court documents. Beasley also said he would not go back to prison - an apparent reference to earlier felony convictions in Cape Girardeau and St. Francois counties.

According to Fox2Now, Beasley had child molestation charges filed against him in April.  Then in June, according to court records, a judge ordered Beasley have no contact with the victim or with any children not related to him.

Markell Beasley's heartbroken father spoke to KMOV about his concerns surrounding Demetrius Beasley.

Reporter Brittany Noble asked Tullock if he thought his son was safe around Demetrius. 'He wasn’t, they knew he wasn’t safe. I knew he wasn’t safe and everyone around him knew he wasn’t safe,' said Tullock.

Yesterday, Gelling posted a smiling picture of her son Markell as her profile picture on Facebook.
