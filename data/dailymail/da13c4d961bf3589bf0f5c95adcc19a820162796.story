The resurgent Green Party does not want an endorsement from celebrity activist Russell Brand, party sources have revealed.

There had been mounting speculation that the comedian-turned-anarchist – who has worked with leaders of the Left-wing environmental party in recent years – would be unveiled as the ‘Green Nigel Farage’.

But senior party sources claimed they didn’t need an answer to the charismatic Ukip leader.

One said that if such an offer were to be made to Mr Brand, it should be declined because his ‘controversial’ reputation would be ‘toxic’ to some potential voters.

‘It might seem like a good idea for two or three days but I suspect it would quickly turn into a nightmare,’ the source added. 

Last year Green leader Natalie Bennett joined Mr Brand to address 1,200 people at an anti-austerity rally in London.

He has also worked with Green MP Caroline Lucas, to get the Commons to debate drug policy.

But Ms Bennett said last month that the party did not need ‘big personalities’ to be a success at the ballot box. 

She insisted it wanted to concentrate on serious issues and not be led by a person who ‘tosses their hair around and waves a pint’.

Two separate polls this week confirmed a dramatic surge in support for the Greens. A YouGov poll showed them securing 10 per cent of the vote, with Labour support at its lowest since 2010.

The Greens were on 9 per cent in a survey of voting intentions by ICM – a rise of four per cent in just one month. That is the party’s highest rating for two decades.

Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: 'I do not recognise the sentiment in these quotes. 

One said that if such an offer were to be made to Mr Brand, it should be declined because his ‘controversial’ reputation would be ‘toxic’ to some potential voters 

'I've worked closely with Russell to promote a more evidence-based, effective and humane approach to drugs policy and appreciate all he has done to put the issue on the political agenda. He has effectively rattled the cage of Parliament and it is right that he has - MPs need to do far more to regain people's trust and confidence.'

A party spokesman added that it and Mr Brand 'both believe there is a positive alternative to austerity economics and recognise that the politics of the future does not have to look like the politics of the past'.

Australian-born Miss Bennett has taken the Greens to new heights since Miss Lucas, previously the most high profile figure in the party, stepped down from the role in 2012.

Polling suggests Labour and the Lib Dems risk being engulfed by a 'Green Tide' which pollsters could cost Ed Miliband up to 17 seats at the election.

The Greens appear to be doing particularly well among students and other younger voters, as well as peeling off some of the disaffected ex-Lib Dems who switched to Labour when their former party entered coalition with the Conservatives.

There are growing fears among Labour MPs that the Greens - who have now been invited to take part in leaders' TV debates - could disrupt Mr Miliband's alleged '35 per cent strategy' of winning power with Labour's core vote plus another five or six per cent coming from disillusioned former Lib Dems.

Ben Page, head of polling firm Ipsos Mori, said a Green vote share of nine per cent could cost Labour seventeen seats, which most of which would be won by the Tories.

He said a Green tide in crucial university cities and towns could pose ‘a real problem for Labour’.

Natalie Bennett, the leader of the Green Party, once joined Mr Brand to address 1,200 people at an anti-austerity rally in London.

The party has seen a huge rush of membership applications in recent weeks after David Cameron refused to take part in TV debates unless the Greens were excluded.

The PM said it was not fair to include some minor parties like Ukip and the Lib Dems but not others.

The Greens say their party rolls now approach 48,000, giving it more members than Ukip who have around 42,000 and the Liberal Democrats on some 45,000. Membership numbers have doubled in the past 12 months.

Miss Bennett said this week that the party was targeting 12 seats in May. 

But she told BBC Newsnight it was possible that given the growth in support in recent weeks it could do even better.

The Greens support radical policies including slashing funding for roads, ditching the Trident nuclear defence system and a raft of taxes on the wealthy – which appeal to disaffected left wing voters.

The last time the Greens threatened the political establishment was in 1989 when they secured 2.2 million votes in European parliamentary elections.

Last week Mr Miliband made a direct pitch to Green voters vowing to build more wind farms and saying that environmental issues were 'at the heart' of his beliefs.
