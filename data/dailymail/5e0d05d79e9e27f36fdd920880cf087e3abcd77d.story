Trial: Anxiang Du, 54, allegedly said 'blackness' came over him as he carried out the brutal stabbings

A man accused of murdering a family of four told a psychiatrist that ‘blackness’ came over him as he carried out the brutal stabbings, a court heard today.

Anxiang Du, 54, is accused of knifing Manchester Metropolitan University lecturer Jifeng ‘Jeff’ Ding, his wife Ge ‘Helen’ Chui, and their two daughters, Xing ‘Nancy’, 18, and Alice, 12, at their home in Wootton, Northamptonshire.

During his trial which began last week, a jury has heard he carried out the stabbings following a long-running legal dispute after a business relationship turned sour.

After the April 2011 killings, Du, who denies four counts of murder, fled to Morocco where he was eventually arrested and extradited back to the UK, at Northampton Crown Court heard.

Today Professor Nigel Eastman, a forensic psychiatrist, told jurors he interviewed Du in prison in August last year after he was brought back to Britain to face four charges of murder.

Giving evidence for the defence today, Mr Eastman told the court Mr Du had given him an account of the events that had unfolded on the day of the killings in 2011.

Mr Eastman said Du thought about going
to see the Dings after seeing a knife in a bag in his shop in 
Birmingham on the morning of April 29, 2011.

The
court heard Du had taken the knife to his shop previously with the 
thought that he may take his own life. Mr Eastman said Du told him he 
had wanted to get the Dings to give back the money.

Mr
Eastman told the court: ‘He said “I wanted to get them to give back the
money. It is why I carried the bag. I picked up the bag with the knife 
in it at that stage”.’

'At the time my heart was feeling hopeless. There was a very strong feeling of no way out'

What Anxiang Du 'told psychiatrist'

The psychiatrist had asked Du whether he had thought about causing the Dings harm.

Mr
Eastman told the court: ‘He replied “possibly”. I then asked him what 
possibly meant. He said “If they don’t give me the money then I would do
that to harm them”.’

The psychiatrist had then asked Du whether he had the intention to kill the Dings if they had not given him money.

Mr
Du replied: ‘I think that if the Dings had apologised to me I probably 
would not have done that. Throughout they never apologised.’

Mr Eastman told the jury he then asked Mr Du whether he had thought in advance about killing the Dings.

House: Du told a psychiatrist that he had become 'uncontrollably distressed and sobbed' when he saw the two daughters in the bedroom of the home in Wootton, Northamptonshire, the court heard

‘He
said “I did not have such forethought. I did not think so far ahead. If
I had I probably would never have gone there. At the time my heart was 
feeling hopeless. There was a very strong feeling of no way out”.’

Du
said that when he arrived at the Dings house in Wootton he went through
the garage as the family had never answered the front door in the past 
when he had rung the doorbell.

Mr
Eastman went on: ‘He told me he went into the garden and saw Mr Ding 
through the kitchen window and then he went into the kitchen.’

Du told Mr Eastman he had asked Mr Ding for money but that he could not remember how much.

Mr
Eastman said Du told him: ‘Mr Ding said I was stupid and a fool. His 
facial expression was one of mocking. He ordered me to leave. I think he
also said he would call the police.

‘I
did not say anything. I withdrew the knife from the bag. I was not 
thinking anything. My mind was blank.’ Mr Eastman then said Du told him 
he felt he saw ‘blackness’ and that Mr Ding’s appearance was distorted 
and ‘ugly’.

The psychiatrist
said the evidence demonstrated Mr Du was in a ‘high state of arousal’ 
at the time he carried out the killings but did not fully support the 
basis of diminished responsibility.

Mr
Eastman continued: ‘He (Du) said another person came and grabbed my arm
so I pointed the knife at her then they fell. He said he had stabbed Mr
Ding to the body and his wife but did not continue when they fell to 
the ground.

'I did not hate them (the daughters) at all. I don’t know why. I am so sorry'

What Anxiang Du 'told psychiatrist'

‘He told me he 
did not know how many times he had stabbed them both.’ Du told the 
psychiatrist that he went upstairs ‘after hearing a noise’.

He
told Mr Eastman that he had become ‘uncontrollably distressed and 
sobbed’ when he saw the two daughters in the bedroom. ‘I also killed 
them, I don’t know why,’ Du told Mr Eastman.

Mr
Eastman asked him whether he had any hatred for the two children. Du 
replied: ‘I did not hate them at all. I don’t know why. I am so sorry.’

He
added that he did not resent the daughters, saying: ‘I do not have any 
such feelings. It was a big sin, me killing them. I was not thinking of 
anything.’

Du told him he could not remember which daughter he had stabbed first or how many times he had attacked each of them.

Deaths: Sisters Xing 'Nancy' Ding (left) and Alice (right) were also killed in the attack, the court has been told

‘The
next thing I remember is I laid down and slept then it was dark 
already. I did not know what time it was then I saw a wallet with money 
in it and car keys and decided to escape.’

Mr Eastman said he asked Du why he wanted to escape and he had replied: ‘I don’t know. I wanted to run away.’

The
bodies of Mr and Mrs Ding were found downstairs in the kitchen of their
home, and Alice and Nancy were found dead in an upstairs bedroom on May
1, 2011, two days after the brutal killings.

Post-mortem tests showed Mr Ding had been stabbed 23 times, Mrs Ding 13 times, Nancy had 11 stab wounds and Alice had four.

Prosecutors
allege Du stabbed the Ding family in order to ‘avenge himself’ after 
their business relationship in Chinese medicine broke down and he ended 
up owing £88,000 in costs following a lengthy legal battle between the 
two families.

William 
Harbage QC, prosecuting, has told jurors that there was no argument that
Du was responsible for the killings but the defendant would claim he 
should only be convicted of manslaughter on the basis of either 
diminished responsibility or loss of control. The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
