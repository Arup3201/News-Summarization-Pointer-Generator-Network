His eyes bulging and his mouth wide with panic, a starving squirrel stretches out a despairing arm as his nuts fall irretrievably to the ground.

There's not a human being alive that doesn't know that desperate feeling of losing something of great personal value.

And, as this picture shows, animals lose things too... but it never gets any easier.

The photograph was taken by keen amateur photographer Ajeet Vikram, 27, outside his home in Dehardun, northern India.

Nooooooo! His eyes bulging and his mouth wide with panic, a starving squirrel stretches out a despairing arm as his nut falls irretrievably to the ground

Grooming: The day began so well as the rodent climbed to the top of the sun-soaked pylon for a spot of self-grooming before breakfast

Ajeet, how works as development manager by day, said that his original intention was to shoot the sunrise, but then the squirrel caught his eye basking in the morning light.

It was scurrying up and down an electrical pole outside his house before settling on its top to tuck in to breakfast.

But as it opened its mouth to eat, it fumbled the treat sending it plummeting to earth, just as Ajeet took a picture.

Ajeet said: 'It was a early morning and I wanted to shoot sunrise, but suddenly I saw the squirrel on top of the electrical pole.

Inconsolable: But after the squirrel dropped its prized food, Ajeet managed to capture the exact moment of despair

Nowhere to be seen: The squirrel searches the ground despairingly for his food

Acorn crazy: The picture is reminiscent of Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel from the Ice Age films, who keeps losing his acorn

'The squirrel was contentiously going up and down the electric pole, and then suddenly squirrel climbed on the top and started to eat something. This made me want to take pictures.

'The squirrel had hold of some kind of nut, which he dropped.

'When I saw the photo, I thought 'Bingo' - it was mindblowing. My friends all call me a real photographer now.

'I really like squirrels. I think they look really innocent.'
