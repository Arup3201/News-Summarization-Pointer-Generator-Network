This is the medical student who called herself Elizabeth Raine and controversially auctioned off her virginity - only to change her mind at the last minute, Mail Online can reveal.

Hanna Kern, a high-achieving college graduate, made headlines around the world when she dubbed herself the 'Virgin Whore' and said she would sleep with the highest bidder.

The intelligent, middle-class bioengineering student backed out of the sleazy auction on Wednesday, with the fee standing at $801,000.

Revealed: Virgin Whore Elizabeth Raine is actually high-achieving graduate Hanna Kern

'With the blessings of my management and the high bidders, I have decided to put a stop to this kerfuffle (to describe it nicely) and return my focus to my medical training,' she wrote on her blog, provocatively entitled Musings of a Virgin Whore.

'I still do possess some spitefully strong beliefs about virginity, prostitution, and a woman's right to do as she damned pleases, but school is my first priority (as it has been for my entire life).

'At this point, I no longer care about the auction, at all. This was a very easy decision.'

But despite her claims to have abandoned the auction to concentrate on her schooling, Mail Online can reveal that Hanna hardly received any genuine offers for her virginity.

In fact the, 'winning' bidder refused to go through any kind of vetting process and completely disappeared after he pledged to come up with the cash.

A source 
close to Hanna said: 'This auction didn't work, plain and simple. Hanna 
had to face the fact that maybe her virginity wasn't worth as much as 
she thought it was.'

Mail
 Online can also reveal furious professors at her college, the 
University of Washington, found out about the auction and hauled her in 
to explain herself.

They have agreed to allow her to take crucial qualifying exams next Friday, but she will have to go in for talks next month.

Auction: Kern offered up her virginity on a website, where she used the name Elizabeth Raine

At that point they will let her know what disciplinary action she will face for sullying the name of the prestigious university.

They have already told her that her ‘immoral’ behavior has put her future career in the medical profession in serious jeopardy.   

Since abandoning the auction, Utah-born Hanna, has been keeping a low profile in her shared apartment in the north of Seattle.

On Friday fellow students on campus said they recognized Hanna as the girl in the racy pictures posted on her blog site, but were in disbelief that that the 'shy' pupil would take part in such a scandalous enterprise.

One male undergraduate said: 'I am absolutely amazed. I saw the story online and straight away I said it looks like Hanna, but I couldn't believe it was actually her.

'She's a really quiet, shy girl and this seems so out of character.'

And after examining Hanna’s personality it seems she had been living a double live. Her fellow students knew her as a shy, studious pupil and the rest of the world knew her alter-ego, the opinionated and provocative Virgin Whore, Elizabeth Raine.

In a string of forthright blog boasts, Raine initially explained how she was selling her virginity for the money. But in recent days, her tone changed and became far more political.

'It is no longer about the money,' she wrote. 'Instead, very broadly, it is about how society continues to exercise control over female sexuality by chaining it tightly to female morality.

Cold feet: Kern pulled out of her online auction on Wednesday, saying she wanted to focus on her studies

'It is about the fact that we have not left patriarchy in the past (we all know male morality is not judged by the same standard), and that a woman still cannot chose to do with her body what she pleases without eliciting condemnation and hate from those (or some of those) around her.'

It seems she didn’t express those kinds of feminist views when she was studying for her undergraduate degree at the University of Boulder in Colorado.

Hanna excelled during her time there and wrote a number of incredibly complex medical papers.

She graduated in 2010 and started at the University of Washington, where she has specialized in bioengineering.

Again, she has impressed in medical research and contributed to a number of ground-breaking papers alongside other students and professors.

Hanna’s family life also seems at odds with her racy alter-ego. Her father Allan Kern is a successful business man, who lives in Long Beach, California and works as the Principal Consultant for the oil and gas firm he founded, APCperformance.com.

His LinkedIn profile says he has 35 years experience and that he has authored numerous papers. He is a graduate of the University of Wyoming.

His work in the oil industry took the family to Saudi Arabia about 20 years ago.

He lived in the Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran with Hanna, her mother Kim, and her younger brother Jackson, who now lives in Athens, Georgia.

Hanna suffered a personal tragedy at the age of ten, when her mother died in a plane crash near Delhi, India, in 1996. At the time it was the third-worst disaster in aviation history, claiming the lives of 349 people.

Hanna - whose story made international headlines after representation by Australian firm Uniquemedia PR -  claimed on her blog that her family were fully behind her decision to sell her virginity.

Auction: Despite attracting a bid of $801,000, a source claims those making the offers went quiet when asked to prove their credentials

But on Friday her father refused to speak to Mail Online over the phone, hanging up as soon as his daughter's name was mentioned.

Hanna did respond to email, declining an interviewing, saying she was, 'very busy and stressed right now, with pressing school commitments'.

When she set up the auction website, she initially hid her face, simply showing off her body in a series of provocative shots, professionally taken in a Seattle hotel.

But after prospective bidders started to pull out because they could not see what she looked like, she changed her approach and posted a series of snaps giving away her identity.

Bizarrely, she insisted she still wanted to remain anonymous, even though her heavily airbrushed image was there for all to see.

And despite claims that bids for her virginity came flooding in, a source close to Hanna has revealed the majority were from chancers who refused to prove they had any way of coming up with the cash.

The source said: 'Hanna has tried to pass this off as a success and said she took the decision to pull out despite that.

'But this auction did not really work. Sure, loads of bids came in, but when the men in question were asked to prove their credentials they went quiet.

'They could have been sitting In a trailer park without two cents to rub together, pledging to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars.

'The winning bidder laid down the offer, but when he was sent an email asking to send his number so he could be vetted, he went completely quiet. There is no way it was a genuine bid.

'Who knows why Hanna decided to pull out, but it might well have been because her virginity wasn't worth as much as she thought it was.'

Hanna launched the online auction on March 31, but it seems she established the domain name of her website last June, meaning the auction was planned for almost a year.

Initially, she said she wanted to sell her virginity because she was attracted by the adventure, eroticism, scandal and the chance to challenge the norm.

In an interview with the Huffington Post, while her identity was still a closely guarded secret, Hanna said she was still a virgin because sex and relationships came second to school work and other commitments.

'I have a busy life. I am picky and guys were never a priority,' she said.

She also admitted she was concerned her 'business venture' might get her thrown out of college if officials learned she's the 'Med School Virgin.'

'Lawyers have different opinions on whether I'd get kicked out, but one lawyer I trust believes it won't happen,' she said.

If she had gone through with the deal, the sex would have taken place in Australia because prostitution is illegal in the U.S.
