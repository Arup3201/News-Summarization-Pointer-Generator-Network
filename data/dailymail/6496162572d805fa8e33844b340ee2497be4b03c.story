A feud over the validity of Michael Jackson's will has escalated into open warfare with the late singer's brother Randy accusing estate executors of trying to kill their mother.

Turmoil has roiled the Jackson family very publicly since the days-long 'disappearance' of Katherine Jackson, whose guardianship of Michael's three children was temporarily assigned to her nephew after a judge determined she was prevented from fulfilling her duties 'by a third party'.

But Randy claims the whole charade is all a guise by John Branca, John McClain and their attorney, Howard Weitzman, to manipulate and control the family after allegedly falsifying Jackson's will.

Speaking out: Randy Jackson, pictured in February 2010, has accused Michael Jackson's estate executors of forging his late brother's will and manipulating his family members for their own gain

The public battle was revealed early 
Sunday after a relative reported 82-year-old Katherine Jackson missing, 
but she was later located safely with other family members in Arizona.

Jermaine Jackson has said his mother 
was following doctor's orders to cut off communications with the 
children, who range in age from 10 to 15. He didn't provide further 
details.

Now, in a numbered statement posted to
his verified Twitter account on Friday afternoon, Randy has voiced his 
disapproval for guardianship of Prince, 15, Paris, 14, and Blanket, ten,
to be placed in the care of TJ Jackson, son of his brother, Tito.

Randy explained: 'When TJ asked my mother if he should ask for temporary guardianship, my Mother told TJ NO – twice.'

In control: Executors John McClain, not pictured, John Branca, back left, and their attorney Howard Weitzman, front left and far right, have strenuously denied allegations Jackson's will is a fake

The singer then continued with allegations directed at the executors of his late brother's estate.

'It is clear that anyone who stands up
against the Executors of the Estate - John Branca, John McClain and 
their attorney Howard Weitzman - is denied access to my mother.

'It is my fear and belief, that they are trying to take my mother’s life,' he wrote.

Randy's claims came as Katherine 
Jackson's lawyer on Friday confirmed she would move to share 
guardianship of her minor grandchildren with TJ Jackson, two days after 
he was granted temporary guardianship.

Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff
said there were no indications Mrs Jackson had done anything wrong but 
seemed to have been prevented from fulfilling her duties 'by a third 
party'.

Under fire: Randy also slammed TJ Jackson for seeking guardianship over Michael Jackson's three minor children

Sharing responsibilities: TJ Jackson, pictured on January 27, was appointed temporary guardian of Prince, Paris and Blanket during Katherine Jackson's sudden absence this week

Rival factions in the family have 
released duelling statements on Twitter and family members tussled in 
the driveway of her home in an incident that remains under 
investigation.

Referencing the latter incident, Randy
continued: 'The Estate denied Rebbie, Janet and Jermaine access to the 
house when they returned to home to Calabasas with a letter written by 
Howard Weitzman, attorney for the Estate, who is not a resident of the 
home.

He continued: 'The Estate is trying to
isolate my Mother from her family JUST LIKE THEY DID TO MICHAEL, in 
order to propagate their lies, financial agendas and to protect a 
fraudulent will.

'The same people that are trying to manipulate my mother are the same people that were involved with my brother when he died.

Caught in the middle: (L-R) Blanket, ten, Paris, 14, and Prince Jackson, 15, are said to be behind the move of shared guardianship

'In order to obtain temporary 
guardianship, TJ lied to the court. Rebbie, Janet, Jermaine and I would 
never harm our mother and we are doing our best to protect her and the 
Estate knows that. I want to know why Perry Sanders would consider a 
negotiation based on lies.'

Randy Jackson appeared Tuesday on Al 
Sharpton's MSNBC show PoliticsNation and said he believes his brother's 
will is a fake and that the executors have engaged in criminal activity.

The estate, which recently reported it
saw $475million in gross earnings since Jackson's death in June 2009, 
has denied wrongdoing and called the accusations 'false and defamatory'.

Superior Court Judge Mitchell 
Beckloff, who also oversees financial issues affecting Jackson's estate,
was initially reluctant to appoint a temporary guardian but changed his
mind after hearing from several attorneys who expressed concern about 
the family's problems.

Bizarre: Katherine was surrounded by  Janet, Jermaine, Rebbie and Rebbie's daughter, along with the marketing manager for the Tuscon resort 
where was staying, to quell rumours she was held against her will

Emotional: Mrs Jackson read a statement claiming she was 'devastated' to lose custody and said she had been
on a 'short vacation' - but today confirmed through a lawyer she will 
seek joint guardianship with TJ

He made the ruling after hearing TJ 
Jackson's description of a 'strange' conversation he had with Katherine 
Jackson on Tuesday evening.

Legend: Michael Jackson, pictured in May 2005, left a reported billion-dollar legacy to his children

'I've never heard my grandmother talk like that,' he said reluctantly. 'In every way. The sound in her voice. The pauses.'

He said some of her speech sounded slurred and she used words that made him wonder if she was speaking in code.

In her statement to ABC News, 
Katherine Jackson said she didn't want any calls during her vacation and
thought she had made appropriate arrangements for her grandchildren.

In a bizarre showing of unity, seated 
with children Randy, Janet and Rebbie, Rebbie's daughter and the 
marketing manager of the resort in which she stayed, Mrs Jackson read a 
written statement and denied being held against her will.

The latest feud between the Jacksons is said to have been stemmed from a dispute over Michael Jackson's $500million will.

Jackson died in June 2009 at age 50 and left his estate to care for his mother and three children. He left nothing to his father or siblings, who have repeatedly tried to intervene in the estate.

Several have expressed doubts about the validity of his will, although the courts have rejected this.

And now it has been revealed that Randy 
'pressured' his sister Janet to join others family members in an attempt
to eradicate the executors of Michael's will.

Several people were shocked to learn that Janet had signed a letter sent to the executors of the Thriller singer's estate demanding their resignation, as she had been against the motion.

But now it has been reported that Randy who Janet is close to 'wore' the songstress down as he believed her signature on the letter would give it more ground due to her fame.

A source close to the family told RadarOnline: 'The public has seen a very different side of Janet this past week, and she has to be regretting following Randy's advice. Janet is very much like Katherine in that she likes to keep a low profile, and not have family drama play out in the press'.

La Toya Jackson has meanwhile been noticeably absent from the public family squabbling.

According to TMZ, the singer has urged her siblings to suspend their attacks and 'stop making a public spectacle of themselves' in effort not to damage the family name.
