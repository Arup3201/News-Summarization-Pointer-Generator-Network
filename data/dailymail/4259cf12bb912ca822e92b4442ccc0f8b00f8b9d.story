Anna Wintour has joined the stampede of stars boycotting the Dorchester Collection hotels for their links with the Sultan of Brunei, who has implemented Sharia Law in his country.

The Vogue editor has confirmed that she will not be staying at the Le Meurice, the hotel favoured by the fashion elite and her usual base during Paris Fashion Week.

Ms Wintour release a statement to the New York Times explaining: 'While I am sensitive to the potential 
impact that this issue may have on the wonderful staff at Le Meurice, I 
cannot in all good conscience stay there, nor can Vogue’s editors.'

The British editor's decision comes as Conde Nast confirmed that all its magazines have opted to boycott the Dorchester Collection of hotels, which includes The Dorchester and 45 Park Lane, in London, as well as famous retreat Coworth Park, in Windsor.

Stephen Fry was among the first British stars to announce he was joining the campaign, tweeted that he had cancelled his stay at Coworth Park.

In the US, the Beverly Hills Hotel, in Los Angeles, has become a main focus for Hollywood and the fashion industry's anger after the Sultan of Brunei approved new laws which call for homosexuals and adulterers to be stoned to death.

Star support: Russell Crowe tweeted that he did not agree with the boycott of The Beverly Hills Hotel

Chat show hosts Ellen DeGeneres and Jay 
Leno are among those who have spoken out against the properties, with 
Sir Richard Branson and Sharon 
Osbourne also confirming they would be avoiding the hotels.

Members of the fashion industry such as shoe 
designer Brian Atwood and designer Peter Som have also called for 
action, as well as François-Henri Pinault, the head of Kering, which 
owns Gucci, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen.

However, not everyone agrees with the action being taken against the hotels.

Hollywood star Russell Crowe has announced that he didn't support the Hollywood boycott that has crippled business.

The star wrote on Twitter that didn't agree with the boycott as it hits hard-working staff he considers  his 'friends'.

Once known as the place 'to be seen', the hotel has been almost empty in recent weeks thanks to the boycott.

Dissension: Russell Crowe said he did not agree with the hotel boycott

The Gladiator star Crowe tweeeted his support for workers, 
saying: 'I don't agree with the boycotting of Dorchester Collection 
hotels. It only hurts the hard working staff who I consider friends.'

His message was greet with support on Twitter, with 102 people rewteeted the comment and 274 'favouriting' the tweet.

However, not everyone agreed with the 
star. Scott Holleran ‏tweeted: 'Maybe you should watch Gladiator again 
for a refresher in what it truly means to persecute innocent people.'

In the pink: The Beverly Hills Hotel has been a favourite retreat of Hollywood stars since it opened in 1912 - but has found itself at the centre of protests against its owner, the Sultan of Brunei, and Brunei's new anti-gay laws

A gathering storm: Celebrities such as comedian Jay Leno have led protests outside the Beverly Hills Hotel

Kevin Kane added:
 'I am married to a gay Bruniean. Giving money to the Sultan is support.
 Boycott leads to media interest and political pressure.'

Reality 
star Kim Kardashian is said to have cancelled her bridal shower at the 
hotel, while the Motion Picture & Television Fund said it will no 
longer hold its annual ‘Night Before the Oscars’ party at the hotel.

The
 Fund said it was making a protest at Brunei’s new sharia criminal law, 
which punishes same-sex relationships, as well as adultery and 
abortions, with flogging and stoning.

‘We
 cannot condone or tolerate these harsh and repressive laws, and as a 
result support a business owned by the Sultan of Brunei or a Brunei 
sovereign fund associated with the government of Brunei,’ the Fund's 
directors said in a statement.

Coming under fire: Protestors have been gathering outside the Beverly Hills Hotel all week

Prominent 
figures such as comedians Ellen DeGeneres and Jay Leno, and entrepreneur
 Richard Branson, have been among those to advocate shunning the hotel 
and its bungalows – a favoured locale for the Hollywood elite since it 
opened its doors in 1912.

Branson
 tweeted that no member of his Virgin staff would stay at any Dorchester
 Collection property ‘until the Sultan abides by basic human rights.’

Mavis
 Leno, co-chair of the Global Women's Rights Awards with husband Jay 
Leno, said the new penalties ‘violate international law and have no 
place in civilised society.’

Flashpoint: The Dorchester Collection, which runs the Beverly Hills Hotel, says the current protests are misdirected

In an added move, the City of Beverly Hills voted to pressure the government of Brunei into selling the Beverly Hills Hotel in the wake of its new laws.

Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has praised his state's laws as a ‘great achievement.’

Brunei, a conservative country where alcohol is banned and Muslim courts already govern family affairs, has begun phasing in its version of sharia law, which allows for penalties such as amputation for theft and stoning for adultery.

The most severe punishments – flogging, amputation and stoning – are to be introduced over the next two years.

Response: Comedian Ellen Degeneres and entrepreneur Richard Branson have been vocal in their opposition

The Dorchester Collection's chief executive has said that the hotel boycott is misdirected.

‘American companies across the board are funded by foreign investment, including sovereign wealth funds,' Christopher Cowdray said in a statement.

The Beverly Hills Hotel has played host to a constellation of stars in its 102-year history.

Leading lights such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, John Wayne, Faye Dunaway and The Beatles have all stayed or partied amid the property's inimitable pink walls.
