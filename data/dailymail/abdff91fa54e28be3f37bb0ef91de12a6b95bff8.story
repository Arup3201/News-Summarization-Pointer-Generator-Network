'One of the children they operated on was a four year old boy called William who sustained terrible injuries to his leg during the typhoon.

'He received an emergency treatment at the time, but had to have a further amputation due to a serious infection.'

Six British doctors, supported by Save the Children and UKAID landed in Tacloban on November 18 to work in a field hospital run by the Australian government.
