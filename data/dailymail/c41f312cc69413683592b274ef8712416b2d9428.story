Human remains have been found near the Australian waterway where a 12-year-old boy was grabbed by a crocodile on the weekend, it was revealed today.

Police would not provide any more immediate details but Sergeant Steve Constable said the previous search for the youngster has now become a recovery operation.

The body parts, which have yet to be formally identified, were found near the scene of the attack, in the world-famous Kakadu National Park.

The child's parents, who live on a nearby Aboriginal settlement, have been informed of the discovery.

A saltwater crocodile lurks in the water at Kakadu National Park: Human remains - believed to be those of a 12-year-old boy snatched by a saltie - have been found by police

The remains were found after police shot a third crocodile and examined its stomach contents for evidence of the boy, but nothing was found. They said that two more crocodiles were seen in the area where the body parts were found, but they sank back beneath the water before they could be shot and examined.

In a statement, police said that officers and rangers from Parks Australia had recommenced the search for the missing boy, 'believed to have been taken by a crocodile whilst swimming in a billabong west of Jabiru.'

Acting Commander Michael White of the Northern Command said teams have been conducting ground, boat and air searches since the boy's disappearance at Mudginberri Billabong on Sunday afternoon.'

He said that this morning, 'search teams have now located evidence within the search area which strongly indicates the boy has died from the crocodile attack.'

Commander White said further DNA testing would be carried out to confirm identification.

But he said that no specifics would be given in relation to the trauma or type of evidence located out of respect for the family.

A report will now be prepared for the coroner.

Meanwhile a mother of one of the victim's friends told the Northern Territory News of her son's terror as he witnessed the crocodile attack.

Sandra Djandjul, 38, who lives near the billabong, said her son was still frightened by the horrific attack.

'He keeps thinking too much about his cousin-brother,' she said.

It was her son, Jayden, who was initially attacked by the crocodile, resulting in his right arm being bruised all the way to the shoulder. He also had to have three stitches, but he was able to escape with his life.

The small community of about 50 people, who live some 14 miles from the mining town of Jabiru, have been shaken by the attack, aware that many children have been swimming in the billabong in recent times.

Residents said the killer crocodile, which is believed to have been fairly small at around 2.5metres long, could be anywhere - and there were fears that it could strike again.

'Even small crocs can be dangerous,' said a local business owner, who pointed out that all they had to do was drag a human under water and hold the victim until they drowned.

Since the boy's disappearance on Sunday, a grim search has been conducted which has involved several crocodiles being shot and their stomachs cut open.

Two large crocodiles were shot on Sunday night as police and park rangers patrolled the stretch of water where the boy and a group of friends were swimming.

A crocodile expert examined the bite marks on the arm of Jayden, the boy who survived the attack, to establish the size of the reptile to prevent numerous 'innocent' creatures being shot. He estimated the attacking crocodile to be between 2.5 and 3metres.

Police sergeant Stephen Constable said other officers and park rangers had located two large crocodiles in the Mudginberri billabong in the early hours of the morning in the area where the boy was taken.

'One was 4.3 metres and one was 4.7 metres,'  Sergeant Constable told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 'Both of those were shot and removed from the area.

'We've since had a look at both crocodiles and neither of them had anything in their stomachs and we're now going to continue the search.'

Officials had been searching the area, around 140 miles east of Darwin, since early Sunday afternoon after the alarm was raised.

Police also spoke to four of the boys from a nearby Aboriginal settlement who witnessed the terrifying attack.

Kakadu is where the original Crocodile Dundee movie was made.

Twelve months ago another teenager fought off a five metre saltwater crocodile in the same area, resulting in warnings being stepped up about the dangers of crocs in Northern Territory rivers and waterways.

Because there have been no attacks in the Mudginberri billabong area in recent times, police believe the boys entered the water without looking around for crocodiles that might be lurking there.

The current wet season is the most dangerous time of year to be swimming in the Territory's waters.

From the beginning of the search, it was understood that privately police and rangers feared there would be little chance of the missing boy still being alive - crocodiles usually swim with their prey to the bottom of rivers and perform a 'death roll' until the victim drowns, if death has not already occurred in the reptile's jaws.

Saltwater crocodiles - known as salties -  can grow up to seven metres long, weigh more than a tonne, and are a common feature of Australia's tropical north.

Their numbers have increased steadily since the introduction of protection laws in 1971, with government estimates putting the population at 75,000-100,000.

The most recent fatality was in August last year, when a man was taken by a 4.7-metre croc as he swam across the Mary River.

Parks officials said the Magela Creek area was well signposted as a crocodile danger zone.

'We have big croc warning signs with croc jaws and a big thing saying "croc risk; do not swim here, do not enter",' a spokeswoman said.

Australian researchers launched the world's first crocodile attack database, CrocBITE, last month, hoping to firm up anecdotal reports that harmful or fatal incidents are increasing.

Sunday's attack in Kakadu is the 11th fatality recorded so far this year by the CrocBITE team, which is based at Australia's Charles Darwin University.

The other crocodile-related deaths in 2014 have been in Angola, East Timor, India, Indonesia, Namibia, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Five have involved saltwater crocs.

Thirteen people, including six children, have been killed by crocodiles in Australia in the past 12 years.
