Geraint Jones never dreamed he would earn a 50th one-day international cap eight years after his 49th, let alone that it would come with a country other than England.

Yet Gloucestershire’s new captain began another chapter in the most diverse of careers when he played for Papua New Guinea in their first two official 50-over internationals.

Jones, 38, has been involved with the country of his birth for three years and lined up against Hong Kong last month in their first games since being given full one-day international status.

‘It’s absolutely fantastic,’ said the man who was England’s wicketkeeper in the fabled 2005 Ashes triumph. ‘When I started playing for PNG I never believed it would lead to my 50th cap but the improvement in their cricket has been dramatic.

‘Most of the guys play professionally in Australia now and I thoroughly enjoy being a part of what they are doing. There is pressure to perform, without all the pressure that surrounds playing with England.

‘I don’t keep wicket, I play as a batsman and try to pass on my experience. The players are hugely proud and passionate but you can just get on with it without huge scrutiny and that’s refreshing.’

It is the latest step in quite a journey for the son of a pair of Welsh teachers who spent 10 years in Papua New Guinea before settling in Australia.

Jones came to Britain to explore his roots but ended up forging a long and successful career with Kent that earned him 34 Test caps with England.

Most notably he was an integral part of Michael Vaughan’s side that thrillingly claimed the Ashes and took the catch that clinched what has since been described as the greatest Test of them all.

The snaffling of Michael Kasprowicz off Steve Harmison’s bowling by Jones when all seemed lost for England, and the slow raising of Billy Bowden’s crooked finger, earned the most extraordinary two-run victory at Edgbaston and remains one of the iconic moments in English sporting history.

England may have won the Ashes three times since 2005 — and been thrashed 5-0 twice since then, too — but nothing can quite compare with the series in which England defeated the great Australians in their prime.

‘People still tell me that they watched that Edgbaston game on TV from behind their sofa,’ said Jones. ‘It was incredible to take the winning catch there and to put on runs with Freddie Flintoff at Trent Bridge.

‘I scored 85 in that game and if I have one regret it’s that I didn’t go on and make an Ashes hundred. Other than that I’m extremely satisfied with what I did with England.

‘It’s amazing to think that Ashes series was nearly 10 years ago and I know there are a few things being lined up for the anniversary. I will always look back and be hugely proud of what we achieved.’

Now he not only has a new international challenge with Papua New Guinea, but also a new one in the county game, having left Kent for Bristol. ‘I thought my career might be coming to an end and started to seriously consider umpiring,’ said Jones. ‘But the chance has come up to lead Gloucestershire in four-day cricket and I’ve jumped at it. I’ve got to prove I can still do it and I know I will have to particularly work at the physical side of things because Gloucester put huge emphasis on that but it’s very exciting to be captain of a young side.’

The end at Kent came after he lost his place last season to one of the domestic game’s most exciting young talents in Sam Billings. ‘I’m delighted for Sam and there are certainly no bad feelings on my part,’ said Jones. ‘He’s always had huge potential but he went to Australia last winter, threw himself into improving and everything clicked for him.

‘He has incredible potential and I can see him playing ODI cricket in the near future because he is the sort of dynamic player England are crying out for. As well as batting and keeping I think he is the best fielder in the country and I could see him playing in an England side alongside Jos Buttler.’ Billings, who was added to England’s provisional World Cup squad when Craig Kieswetter was forced to pull out, could even come up against Jones if Papua New Guinea come through qualifying for the World Twenty20 in India in 2016.

‘The qualifiers are in Scotland and Ireland next July and I hope my Gloucestershire commitments allow me to be there,’ said Jones.

‘I never made it to a World Cup with England so that would be quite something.’

Whatever happens it has been quite a career, considering professional cricket was the last thing on Jones’s mind when he ventured to Wales from his adopted home in Queensland.

‘I didn’t play professional cricket until I was 24 so it’s been quite a journey,’ added Jones. ‘I’ve got a two-year contract at Gloucestershire which will take me up until I’m 40 and I’m quite proud of that.

‘My wife tells me that none of it would have happened if I hadn’t met her soon after arriving here because I would probably have gone back to Australia. She’s probably right, too.’
