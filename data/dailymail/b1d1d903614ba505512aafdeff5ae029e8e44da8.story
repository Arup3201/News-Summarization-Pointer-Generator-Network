A new book has lifted the lid on the womanizing ways of Bob Hope, claiming the stage and screen veteran 'often cheated' during his 69-year marriage and enjoyed numerous flings with with iconic actresses like Doris Day and Lucille Ball.

The biography, Hope: Entertainer of the Century, by Richard Zoglin, details the many one-night stands and even relationships he carried on with his outside of his union to Dolores Reade Hope, who he married in 1934.

The book claims the couple were never officially married, despite there assertions, and there is no proof they ever walked down the aisle, according to The New York Post. 

But perhaps the most shocking revelation was an affair Hope reportedly had with Rosemarie Frankland, a Welsh beauty queen.

'Great love': Of his many supposed affairs, actor and comedian Bob Hope is said to have had a relationship lasting 'almost 30 years' with beauty queen Rosemarie Frankland, who he crowned Miss World in 1961 (pictured)

Hope crowned her Miss World in 1961 and the relationship blossomed - for the next 30 years, the book claims.

Hope 'took Frankland on his 1961 Christmas trip to the Arctic, supported her when she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a film career and gave her a small part in his 1965 movie I’ll Take Sweden,’ Zoglin wrote.

A former publicist for Hope told the biographer that Hope referred to Frankland 'the great love of his life'.

While it is not known what finally caused the two to part ways, Frankland was found dead of a drug overdose in her shabby LA apartment in 2000.

Next to her body was an empty bottle of pills and an empty bottle of tequila.

Arguably Hope's most high-profile affar was with the incomparable Doris Day.

'Hope claimed to a friend years later that he and Day had a brief romantic fling while they were touring together [raising funds for the March of Dimes, above] in 1949,’ Zoglin writes, The Post reported.

'When they returned home to Burbank, Dolores was at the airport to greet them, giving Bob an ostentatious welcome-home hug.

'According to Hope, Day saw the gesture as a wife’s symbolic marking of her territory, and she ended the relationship then and there.

'Day [now 90] never commented on the alleged affair.’

For several months in 1949, Hope enjoyed an affair with sexpot actress Barbara Payton.

'She followed Hope around the country, moved into a furnished apartment that he rented for her in Hollywood, and when the affair ended in August, was paid off by Hope to keep quiet about it,' Zoglin, quoting Payton's biographer, wrote in his book.

'If so, it didn’t stop Payton . . . from selling her story to Confidential magazine in 1956, a rare breach in the wall of secrecy that surrounded Hope’s sex life.'

In the interview she was damning of Hope and his temper, saying: 'Hope was ... at times a mean-spirited individual with the ability to respond with a ruthless vengeance when sufficiently provoked.'

However, on the back of her failing career, Payton turned to drugs and prostitution.

She eventually drank herself to death in 1967, aged 39.

Another controversial conquest was writer Sandy Vinger, who Zoglin described as Hope's last girlfriend and companion during the 1980s.

In 1994, when Hope was 91, Vinger sued him for breach of contract.

She claimed Hope had promised to support her for life.

The lawsuit was settled out of court.

Hope is also said to have had a four-year relationship with actress Marilyn Maxwell and an affair with his publicist Ursula Halloran.

Zoglin claims Hope's wife 'almost certainly' knew of his cheating ways.

There were also encounters with Lucille Ball, Jane Russell, Madeleine Carroll, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and Dorothy Lamour, The Post reported.

'We’d go to a hotel, I swear to you, outside his room were three, four, five young, beautiful girls, waiting to be picked by him to come in . . . He was a star enjoying his stardom,' said former Hope biographer, Sherwood Schwartz.

However he kept coming home to Delores.

The couple adopted four children.

Their eldest, Linda, is quoted in the book as saying: 'I’m sure my mother knew what was going on. 

'And she just decided that he was worth going through whatever she had to go through, to have the life and be Mrs. Bob Hope.  

'But I don’t think any of the [other women] had the significance to him that she did and the family did.'

Hope died on pneumonia in July 2003, two months after his 100th birthday. 

Delores died in 2011, aged 102.
