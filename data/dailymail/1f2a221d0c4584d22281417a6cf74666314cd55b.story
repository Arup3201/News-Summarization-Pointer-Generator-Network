The estranged wife of Mets pitcher Kris Benson, who allegedly threatened him with a gun last weekend, was sought in a murder nearly 20 years ago, it has been revealed today.

Anna Benson was hunted by police following the fatal shooting of a teenage student in her and a then boyfriend's apartment in 1996.

Benson, who was 19 at the time and a topless dancer, fled Knoxville,Tennessee with 19-year-old boyfriend Paul Dejongh following the execution-style killing of Michael Evans.

Mrs Benson, then called Anna Warren, was living in a squalid apartment covered in satanic graffiti in 1996.

Mr Evans was an acquaintance of the couple who got into an argument with them on January 22.

Police discovered the body of the college student the following day after another housemate called the police.

Mr Evans, who wanted to be a journalist, was found dead by police near the front door with two shots in his head.

The stripper went on the run but was apprehended several months later in Portland, Oregon, having tried to disguise her identity with dyed purple hair. 

America's Most Wanted made an appeal for information at the time which led to the capture of Dejongh by the FBI. He had been working construction in Atlanta, Georgia.

His father Michael Evans Snr spoke to America's Most Wanted at the time, saying: 'I miss Michael's friendship, I miss his love and I miss companionship.'

When he was told that the woman who was apprehended in the killing of his son had been living a millionaire, celebrity lifestyle, Mr Evans was astounded.

Benson was captured after five months on the run and charged with murder - but all charges against her were later dropped, an investigator from the case told the Daily News.

Dejongh was found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to 21 years in jail. He died in prison.

A 911 call made by former Mets pitcher Kris Benson on July 7 revealed a startling violent side to his estranged wife.

In the recording, the baseball player sounds calm as he quietly tells the operator he is in the basement after Mrs Benson allegedly brandished a gun and metal baton while wearing a bulletproof vest.

The Baseball Wives star allegedly confronted Benson in his Georgia home but when she asked him for a cigarette he was able to escape.

'She told me to go get a lighter for her to smoke a cigarette,' Mr Benson said in the 911 call, which was released by TMZ.

'When I left the room, I just did a beeline for the basement.'

As the operator tells him to stay on the line, Mr Benson can be heard saying: 'I just got my hand on the back door in case I hear her coming down the stairs.'

He then fled the house and hid in his neighbor's garden until police arrived. 

When the 911 operator asked him what his wife had said, he explained that he had managed to record her. 

Mr Benson also appears to stifle a shocked laugh when he explains that his 'soon to be ex-wife' was wearing a bulletproof vest when she allegedly threatened him.

Mrs Benson however, told the New York Post yesterday: 'I would never hurt [Kris]. I am still in love with him.'

She added: 'We have been married for 15 
years, and he can’t keep it in his pants. He can’t stop f****** my 
friends, in my house. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t love him.'

She reportedly barged in and ordered Mr Benson to give her $30,000 after she was forced by the court to vacate the couple's marital home, TMZ first reported. 

The mother-of-three was reportedly wielding an 'expandable metal baton' and threatened to hit him if he didn't give her the money.

She also brandished a handgun and a loaded ammunition belt, according to a police report reviewed by TMZ.

Mr Benson, who filed for divorce last 
year, left the home and called police.

He was not injured but Mrs Benson reportedly smashed his computer with the expandable metal baton.

She was booked into jail on four counts, including 
felony aggravated assault with a weapon, criminal trespassing and 
possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime.

In court she admitted to using the baton to smash the computer but denied waving the handgun.

She said the reason she was wearing a bulletproof vest was because of a deal she had made with the manufacturer.

'It was a new model she was testing for a company,' police report she said.

TMZ reported that she alleged 'had to wear it for an extended time to get it to mold to her body.'

When police arrived at the scene, she yelled that her husband was a 'f****** p****'.

She was made temporarily famous by VH1's 'Baseball Wives,' a 2011 reality show that was cancelled after only one season.

Mr Benson pitched in the majors for five teams - including the New York Mets - from 1999 to 2010, when he retired.

He married the former exotic dancer and model, at the start of his major league career in 1999.

The couple have had a rocky relationship, including bouts of cheating and more than one divorce filing.

In 2006, Mrs Benson filed for divorce after she allegedly caught her husband cheating on her with one of her friends.

The couple, who have three children,
decided to stay together- even though she had 
famously told Howard Stern that she would sleep with the entire Mets 
team if he ever cheated.

She
later told ESPN, however, that she was kidding around with her comment 
to Stern and that she wouldn't touch 'some of those guys with a 10ft 
pole. I don't care what Kris did. Some of them are disgusting.'

In
another divorce filing from 2012, Mrs Benson again accused her husband 
of cheating, saying she found racy messages between him and one of her 
friends on Facebook.
