US singer Kelly Clarkson has been thwarted in her bid to take a ring once owned by Jane Austen out of the UK.

The American Idol winner bought the gold and turquoise ring for £150,000 but ministers moved to impose an export ban to block her taking it to the US in the hope of finding a British buyer.

Donations from Austen fans from around the world, and TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh, flooded in and has now been bought by the Jane Austen's House Museum.

Precious: The ring is one of only three surviving pieces of jewellery known to have belonged to Jane Austen

Thwarted: American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson has been told she can't take the ring out of the UK

The ring had been in the Austen family for around 200 years before it was sold at auction last year.

Clarkson, the first winner of talent show American Idol, saw off seven bidders in an auction at Sotheby’s last year for the gold and turquoise ring.

Still in its original box, it was sold for $235,596 despite being expected to fetch only $46,362.

But when Clarkson applied for an export license, a reviewing committee recommended that the ring should be kept in the UK.

The Jane Austen's House Museum in Chawton, Hampshire, where the writer spent the last eight years of her life and where she penned all of her six completed novels, launched its fundraising campaign in August.

It has now raised £157,740 to secure the ring which is expected to go on display in the New Year.

Donations included a single pledge of £100,000 from an anonymous donor.

Clarkson said that she was glad that the museum had acquired the item.

‘The ring is a beautiful national treasure and I am happy to know that so many Jane Austen fans will get to see it at Jane Austen's House Museum,’ she said.

It is not known whether Austen bought or was given the ring - which contains the December turquoise birthstone (Austen's birth month) - and symbolises wisdom and spiritual journeys.

Donor: TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh was among those to give money to the campaign to keep the ring in the UK

After the world-famous author's death in 1817 from an unknown illness, the ring was passed to her sister Cassandra who then gave it to her sister-in-law Eleanor Austen on her engagement to the Reverend Henry Thomas Austen.

Mary Guyatt, curator of the museum, which celebrates the 200th anniversary of the publication of Pride And Prejudice this year, said: ‘The Museum has been stunned by the generosity and light-footedness of all those who have supported our campaign to meet the costs of acquiring Jane Austen’s ring for our permanent collection.

‘Visitors come from all around the world to see the house where she once lived and we will now take great pleasure in displaying this pretty ring for their appreciation.

‘The Government’s decision to decline an export licence reflects how rarely Austen’s personal effects turn up in today’s art market, and having missed out at auction in 2012 we are thrilled to have had this second chance to bring it home to Chawton.’

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said: ‘The export licensing system provides us with a “last chance” to save treasures like these for the nation so they can be enjoyed by all of us. It’s clear from the number of people who gave generously to the campaign just how admired Jane Austen remains to this day.’

The museum, which has also raised enough cash to pay for costs associated with showing the ring, such as its display and insurance, already has two other pieces of jewellery owned by the author of Sense And Sensibility and Emma  - a turquoise bracelet and a topaz cross.

Austen is set to appear on the new £10 banknote following a campaign to have a woman on the currency.

I think Kelly Clarkson should sell the ring back at a higher price to the drama queens.  They should not have put it up for auction to any "outsiders" if they wanted Austen's ring to stay in England.  It appears the warning, Buyer Beware applies big time in England.  I get the ring sentimental value for its connection to the famous authoress.  It isn't an attractive ring. I'd rather get a gorgeous ring from the house of Chanel.

She BOUGHT it. that makes it hers. If you don't wanna give it away (means out of the coutnry), then why did they sell it in first place???

Sorry, but Clarkson won the auction and should be able to do anything she wants with the ring.  The facts are: The UK government, after the auction, refused to let Clarkson take HER ring out of the UK.  Now if it were me and I put down all that money for a ring I would have sold it for double to whoever could come up with the cash.  I would have set the price after auction, not just accepted the price I paid.  This due to the fact that IT WAS MY RING, not the UK governments or anyone elses.  If the UK didn't want the ring to leave the country then the auction should have been limited to UK buyers prior to the auction beginning, but that makes too much sense.

The money has to be raised to much the price paid, so that the buyer will not lose money. This is the same with works of art. Relatively recently a Titian was going to be bought privately, but money was raised for it to be bought for the nation, and it is now split between the National Gallery and The National  Gallery of Scotland. This is essentially the same situation. I understand that Kelly Clarkson has been gracious about what has happened and understands that the ring will exhibited to the public. I agree that perhaps a replica could be made for her.

Not Kelly Clarksons fault but do agree that national treasures should be kept in their nation.  Should never have been put up for sale to people outside the UK.

Load of garbage. If Miss Clarkson purchased the ring at auction, then the ring is all hers. She has every right to take it home. Who the hell has the nerve to sell off an item and then say "no we want a British buyer". Let her take her ring home.Its hers!

This is a common situation, although it normally occurs with works of art, not jewellery. If could not get an export licence, she will not have to pay for the ring. I am glad it is staying in the UK. Ms Clarkson wasn't doing anything wrong by bidding, but Jane Austen fans will be able to see it at Chawton. In private hands, they would not.

if the ring was so important...it should not have been at auction...next time you should put up big signs that say ( ONLY BRITISH CAN BID AT THIS AUCTION )...then the world will see how discrimatory your policies are.
