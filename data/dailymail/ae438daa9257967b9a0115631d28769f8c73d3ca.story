An unarmed man had just got engaged and was working two jobs when he was shot dead by police at an upscale North Carolina community that has four tennis courts, two swimming pools and a clubhouse.

After crashing his car, Jonathon Ferrell climbed out the back window and made his way to Bradfield Farm, where he knocked on a door of a woman who then called police. When they arrived, one officer fired multiple shots at the 24-year-old college football player, killing him.

On Sunday, his friends and family described Ferrell, who had no criminal record, as a 'good guy' and strong athlete who wasn't aggressive.

Ferrell recently became engaged and moved to Charlotte just months ago where he was working two jobs - at Dillard's and Best Buy.

Charged: Officer Randall Kerrick has been charged with voluntary manslaughter after shooting ex-FAMU football player Jonathan Ferrell, 24

'He wasn't really the aggressive 
type,' former teammate Gregory Boler said of Ferrell, who grew up in 
Tallahassee. 'He was a good guy, easy to talk to. ... He just liked to 
be around his friends.'

He added that e was surprised to hear his pal may have been in a confrontation with police.

'It just didn't sound like him,' Boler told the Charlotte Observer. 'He's not that type at all.'

After
climbing from the wreck of his car, Ferrell walked at least half a mile
to the nearest home, which happened to be in the community of white two-story homes 17 miles east of Charlotte. New and resale houses are available in the $110,000 - $230,000 range in the 1000-home community.

Possibly traumatized, the ex-
Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) football player 
had walked to the home of an unidentified woman after the crash on 
Saturday morning, and knocked on her door.

But when she did not recognize him, she slammed the door and called 911- before officer Randall Kerrick shot him dead as he reportedly ran towards him. Kerrick has been charged with voluntary manslaughter.

The homeowner initially opened the 
door thinking it was her husband, but then closed it and called 911 when
she didn't recognize Mr Ferrell, according to reports.

Officers found the unarmed man, and one shot him when a Taser failed to stop him from approaching.

Within hours, investigators determined that the shooting had been excessive and charged the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer with voluntary manslaughter.

Autopsy details have revealed that Ferrell died of 'multiple gunshot wounds' to his chest.

A police statement Saturday said the investigation showed the shooting was excessive and 'Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter.

'In describing the accident, Police Chief Rodney Monroe has said Ferrell was driving a vehicle that crashed into trees off a northeast Charlotte road early Saturday, and the wreck was so severe he would have had to climb out of the back window to escape.

Monroe said he did not know what caused the crash and did not say whether Ferrell suffered injuries.

Ferrell apparently walked about a half-mile to the nearest house and was 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention, Monroe said. Thinking it was her husband coming home late from work, the woman who lives there opened the door. When she saw Ferrell, she shut it and called police about 2:30 a.m., Monroe said.

Monroe said he didn't think the unarmed Ferrell made threats or tried to rob the woman.

On Monday, Chestnut applauded police for charging Kerrick quickly.

'To shoot first and ask questions later is not an appropriate action for a police officer,' Chestnut said.

Kerrick was scheduled to appear in court Monday to face a voluntary manslaughter charge.

Georgia Ferrell: 'I truly forgive him. I pray for him. And I pray that he gets off the police force,' Georgia Ferrell said. 'You took a piece of my heart that I can never get back.'

During a news conference on Monday in Charlotte, Ferrell's mother said she was praying for Kerrick.

'I truly forgive him. I pray for him. And I pray that he gets off the police force,' Georgia Ferrell said. 'You took a piece of my heart that I can never get back.'

'I wanted grandchildren,' his emotional mother said. 'He promised me grandchildren years ago, but I guess that's out.'

She described her son as a 'very uplifting, happy person' who 'wouldn't hurt anyone' and had a tendency for taking in stray animals.

'I had to teach Jonathan that worms were not our friends because Mama is scared of them,' Georgia Ferrell said with a smile.

'He was one of the most magnificent individuals I ever came in contact with,' Jonathan Ferrell's brother Willie said. 'Jonathan was never the type of person to harm nobody.'

Chestnut praised the police chief for acting quickly with arresting and charging Kerrick.

'We applaud the chief for acting swiftly. That was a bold move. It is unprecedented for a chief to move so quickly in not only suspending an officer, but arresting him,' Chestnut said. 'You take away the badge from this officer. This was murder. This was manslaughter.'

Ferrell knocked on this door looking for help after being in a car crash, but the homeowner called 911

Jonathan Ferrell, 24, had played for FAMU in 2009 and 2010, and had only recently moved to North Carolina

Ferrell played for FAMU in 2009 and 
2010. Friends said Ferrell and his young brother Willie were especially 
close and the pair played on their high school and college football 
teams together.

The brothers were just 16 months apart and their father died when they were young.

'Don't know how much I miss u,' Willie Ferrell wrote to his older brother on Sunday. 'I never cried so much.'

In
a 2010 story written about the brothers in the FAMU student newspaper, 
Ferrell talked about how much he enjoyed playing football with his 
brother.

'Playing football 
with him again feels like it did in high school, summer nights you donâ€™t
want to end because they are so much fun,' he said. 'It's refreshing to
come in the locker room and have your best friend to laugh with.'

FAMU
Interim Athletic Director Michael Smith said Ferrell played the safety 
position for the school's football team during the 2009 and 2010 
seasons.

'Our hearts and prayers go out to his family during their time of bereavement,' Smith said.

Ferrell's high school coach, Ira Reynolds, told the Tallahassee Democrat the young man's death was a tragedy.

'To lose him that way is incredibly difficult to deal with for anyone,' Reynolds said.

'He practiced hard and played hard. He didn't talk very much, but when he said something, it spoke volumes.'

A search of public records indicated that Ferrell began living in Charlotte early this year after moving from Tallahassee, Florida, home to FAMU.

Police initially called Ferrell and Kerrick's encounter 'appropriate and lawful.'

But in their statement late Saturday, they said 'the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr Ferrell was excessive' and 'Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter.'

Police said Kerrick was charged with voluntary manslaughter, which under North Carolina law involves killing without malice using 'excessive force' in exercising 'imperfect self-defense.'

Kerrick, 27, of Midland, turned himself in for booking Saturday evening and was released on $50,000 bond, according to the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office website.

Kerrick, who joined the police force in April 2011, is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Tuesday.

Police Chief Rodney Monroe described the auto accident in a news conference: Ferrell was driving a vehicle that crashed into trees off a northeast Charlotte road early Saturday, and the wreck was so severe he would have had to climb out of the back window to escape.

Monroe said he didn't know what caused the crash and didn't say whether Ferrell suffered injuries.

Ferrell apparently walked about a half-mile to the nearest house and was 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention, Monroe said. The female homeowner called police about 2:30 a.m.

Monroe said he didn't think the unarmed Ferrell made threats or tried to rob the woman.
