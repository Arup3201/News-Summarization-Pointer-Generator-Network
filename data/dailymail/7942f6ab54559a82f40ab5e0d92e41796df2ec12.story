A wet Wednesday in Watford and Roy Hodgson stirred in the face of what might prove to be among his toughest tasks of the week: summoning the right amount of enthusiasm while remaining polite about the world’s worst international team.

Hodgson set about it in brisk fashion, fixing a new target on the horizon for his England players to complete this qualification campaign with a perfect set of 10 wins.

Having emerged triumphant from the first and, on paper, the trickiest fixture, against Switzerland in Basle, why not? Reaching Euro 2016 is no longer much of an accomplishment for England and that is nobody’s fault but UEFA’s.

San Marino at Wembley on Thursday night will not present a problem. Estonia in Tallinn on Sunday is perhaps a little tougher but should not disturb the plan.

‘There are 10 qualifying matches,’ said Hodgson. ‘In the last 10, we won six and drew four. It would be nice to go through this qualifying campaign unbeaten. If we get two good results, we’ll set ourselves the target of winning all the games.’

England’s qualification campaign for the World Cup in Brazil was about as unimpressive as a group-topping unbeaten campaign can be. Of the six wins, four were against San Marino and Moldova.

It was not until the final two games that a decent team were beaten, when Hodgson’s side burst into life to finish with wins at home to Montenegro and Poland.

This time, the England boss would like more panache and there were signs of that in Basle last month, when Danny Welbeck scored twice in a new system, with Raheem Sterling playing at the top of a midfield diamond.

The key will be to preserve that momentum over the next two games. ‘I’m looking very much at the movement of our front players and midfielders, which is something we’ve worked on for a long time,’ said Hodgson.

‘And for the same level of defensive commitment we showed against Switzerland in terms of winning the ball back quickly and sustaining attacks.

‘I’d be disappointed if the pace of our play dropped enormously because we’re getting a lot of the ball. I want us to put pressure on ourselves to keep the tempo up.

‘I know the players would like to do that. In football, things don’t always work out the way you hope. But I’m very confident that the players will want to give me and the country the performance I expect.’

Rooney and Hodgson spoke to the press at their Watford base on Wednesday

He swerved the idea that nations with a pedigree as poor as San Marino’s, alongside Bhutan at the bottom of FIFA’s rankings, ought to face a pre-qualifying round to earn the right to play at this stage of the competition. ‘It’s a question for UEFA,’ said Hodgson. ‘But if they play the game properly, it’s not such a bad thing that there’s this discrepancy.’

The last time San Marino’s assortment of computer scientists, interior designers and two professional footballers appeared at Wembley, they did not roll over quite as they were supposed to.

They held out for more than half an hour before conceding from a penalty and goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini clobbered Theo Walcott, forcing him off inside 10 minutes and out of the next game in Poland. England won 5-0 and it was more routine in San Marino, when an own goal was the first of eight.

On both occasions, it was the first game in a double-header and Hodgson changed six players for the more difficult second game, although neither of the difficult games in question was won. These are the imponderables. 

Hodgson reflected on his time in the Europa League at Fulham when he found those he rested from the competition were worse in the next game than those who had played.

So, the England boss insisted there would be ‘no wholesale changes’ to the team which performed well in Switzerland. Even so, do not be surprised to see key men replaced after an hour.

An injury to John Stones means there will be at least one change, with Arsenal teenager Calum Chambers expected to start his first senior international. Fabian Delph, who sat out training on Tuesday, was involved again on Wednesday and is available.

‘We’re keen to keep the momentum going,’ said Hodgson. ‘It’s important we’re taking it seriously. Everyone is anxious to play. The players deserve further confidence. We’ve got to weigh the two things: keeping the team together but also using one of these games as a chance to see someone else play.

‘At management level you never work without fear and every game is important. I don’t think any of us want a complacent life in football.

‘We want to test ourselves and set ourselves standards. I want this team to grow and to look back in two years’ time saying, “We’ve come a long way”. These two matches are important steps along the way.

‘The players need to continue showing they have this burning desire to play good football.’

There are also personal motivations, notably for Wayne Rooney, who will win his 98th cap and hopefully move closer to Sir Bobby Charlton’s goal record.

And for Chambers, if he starts, as well as Nathaniel Clyne, who may win his first cap, and Jonjo Shelvey, who may win his second.
