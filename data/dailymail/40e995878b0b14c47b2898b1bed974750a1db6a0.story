Sheffield United risked a fierce backlash on Tuesday night by confirming that they have agreed to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to return and take part in training at the club.

The PFA are behind the move that will see Evans take a step closer to resuming his professional career following his release from prison last month after serving half of a five-year sentence.

It is understood that the 25-year-old former Wales striker, who earned £20,000 a week at Bramall Lane before his conviction in April 2012, will not be paid by Sheffield United.

Rapist Ched Evans will start training with his former club Sheffield United this week despite 150,000 people demanding the club turn him away

Evans is to marry his fiancee Natasha Massey after proposing shortly after he was released from prison, where he served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl

The League One club insist that the move is designed to allow Evans to regain fitness and declined to say whether he will rejoin them permanently. 

But it is bound to attract strong criticism and campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition spokeswoman Sarah Green said: ‘We are appalled that top football club Sheffield United are taking the first step to allowing an unrepentant convicted rapist back into their team this week.’

United cancelled their press conference for Wednesday night's Johnstone’s Paint Trophy match against Walsall at short notice and issued a lengthy statement on Tuesday evening.

Sheffield United Football Club acknowledges the public discussion on the potential return of its former player, Mr Ched Evans, to professional football following the completion of the custodial portion of his sentence for rape in the courts of England and Wales. While some have speculated about whether the Club will or should invite Mr Evans to return to SUFC as a registered footballer, the Club is not prepared at this time to decide that issue.

The Club also acknowledges receipt of a request from The Professional Footballers' Association ('The PFA') to the effect that the Club consider allowing Mr Evans, who is a PFA member, to train at the Club's facilities. According to the request, this training would be with a view to enabling Mr Evans to get back to a level of fitness, which might enable him to find employment in his chosen trade. This request has come to the Club, because it is the last club at which Mr Evans was registered before his conviction.

In response to The PFA's request, the SUFC Board of Directors has deliberated the matter internally, taking into consideration:

In the course of its deliberations, the Board also spoke with Mr Evans and his representatives.

After due consideration, the Board has decided to respond favourably to The PFA's request and to allow Mr Evans to train at the Club's facilities. This decision, which takes effect immediately, is informed by the following four considerations:

Evans had been serving at HMP Wymott prison in Lancashire but was released earlier this month

(The Club recognises that the same justice system that tried, convicted and punished Mr Evans under law also provides for his rehabilitation under law.)

Apart from this statement, the Club will not be making any further comments about this matter for the foreseeable future.

It is thought Evans, pictured with Massey before he was convicted, did not want to propose from jail

Man City (2007-09): 16 games, 1 goal

Norwich (loan, 2007-08): 28 games, 10 goals

Sheff Utd (2009-12): 103 games, 42 goals

Wales (2008-11): 13 games, 1 goal

It read: ‘After due consideration, the Board has decided to respond favourably to the PFA’s request and to allow Mr Evans to train at the club’s facilities.

‘While some have speculated about whether the club will or should invite Mr Evans to return to SUFC as a registered footballer, the club is not prepared at this time to decide that issue.’

The statement went on to say that ‘the club condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms’ and ‘does not question Mr Evans’ conviction for rape’ but ‘there can be no place for mob justice’. 

Massey, pictured with Evans last week, is said to be 'over the moon' after he proposed to her

Massey, pictured on ITV's This Morning, said she put thoughts of Evans's infidelity 'to one side'

More than 150,000 people have signed a petition urging Sheffield United not to re-sign Evans. The Football League also issued a statement on Tuesday night admitting that they would have no choice but to register him as a player if any club wanted to sign him.

It went on: ‘Ultimately the choice of whether to engage a player that has been released from a custodial sentence will be one for individual clubs who… will have to make their own assessment of the potential consequences for their public reputation and business affairs, as well as the relationship they have with their own supporters.’

Evans has always denied raping the 19-year-old woman in front of friends at a Rhyl hotel in May 2011.

He has vowed to clear his name but it could take up to three months before his application to appeal is heard by the Criminal Case Review Commission.
