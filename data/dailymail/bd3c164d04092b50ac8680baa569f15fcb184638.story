Long before the Golden Gate Bridge became an iconic piece of American engineering, a 1932 proposal called for the center of the structure to be submerged in the San Francisco Bay allowing ships to safely pass above.

The 'boat tunnel' idea, as shown on Modern Mechanix, would've run right through the center of the bridge and was the brainchild of inventor Cleve F. Shaffer.

According to Shaffer's obituary, he's 
imagination 'foresaw the tank, the bazooka, and the moving sidewalk, 
though he failed to win fame from any of them.'

The 'boat tunnel' would allow cars to drive underwater as boats glided easily through the bridge's center

Shaffer's plan was attractive as it was thought to cost just a third of the bridge's $35 million budget, the Atlantic reported.Â 

Plans called for regular truss spans at both ends leading inwards into sections floating on pontoons. Interior ramps not unlike those found in parking garages would crisscross the interior.

Traveling down one ramp would take a vehicle 45 feet below the waterline, traveling to the other ramp then back to the surface would be via a 1,200-foot-long tube.

The design is problematic because of the sudden deceleration needed to enter the ramp areas, which could have led to gridlock.

Today the bridge is a marvel of American engineering, even if boats travel under it the old fashioned way

To protect against the currents, Shaffer advised building a resilient chain barrier to be hung from anchored buoys carrying lights and sound warnings.

What reason the plan was abandoned is lost to time, and today ships pass the Golden Gate by simply steering under it, guided by foghorns.
