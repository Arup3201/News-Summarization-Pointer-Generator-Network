A former Ohio theater teacher described as a 'master manipulator' who secretly videotaped teenage girls in their locker room was sentenced to four years behind bars on Thursday - but not before six of his victims bravely confronted him in court.

Lawrence A. Dibble, 44, pleaded no contest to charges of voyeurism and to sexually abusing one teenage girl as it emerged the pervert had been filming his students since 2002.

One-by-one, his victims walked into the court room to testify how Dibble conducted his lessons in a 'cultlike' manner, instilled fear into them and made them change into tight, revealing leotards with no underwear underneath.

Pervert: Lawrence Dibble did not dare look at his victims as they each testified against him in court in Columbus, Ohio on Thursday

One of Dibbles victims told the Columbus, Ohio court how she needed to spend four-months in a trauma-treatment center for abused victims, while another said that to this day she still suffers from severe panic attacks.

All asked Judge Tim Horton to sentence Dibble to the maximum of 17-years in prison, but were ultimately disappointed that due to a technicality he only received four years.

'We felt like we belonged, and we thought we were safe. He exploited that. He used us,' said former Wellington student, Lauren Neidhardt.

One of the schoolteachers former students told the court the full extent of Dibble's creepy classes and how each student had to promise their souls to him.

Alexandra Vickery, a 2006 graduate of the school, said she is forever 
shaken by the sight of the naked pictures that Dibble took of her

'At one point, I even signed as a witness for his contract of another student's soul,' said victim Corrine Steger.

Steger said that Dibble would terrify his students into silence - and even used physical force to frighten them.

'One time, facing me with his hands around my throat, he told me and I quote, 'I won't kill you today', she said.

The brave victim said that Dibble would make her rub his back and then one day touched her inappropriately.

'He patiently waited until after my 18th birthday, and then he molested me just a month before I graduated,' she said.

The victims made it clear to the court that whatever the outcome, it was important that Dibble was removed from society.

'If he doesn’t go to prison, there’s no doubt in my mind there will be other victims,' Lauren Neidhardt said. 'It’s all he knows.'

Dibble was told by the judge that in addition to his sentence he would have to register on the sex offenders list for 15 years.

'He held a position of trust, and this was not an isolated incident,' the judge said.

Described by prosecutor Ron O'Brien as 'smug and arrogant', Dibble did not even look at his victims as they read their statements.

Steger told the court that Dibble groomed her from the age of 12 until she turned 18 in April 2009.

Crimes: Lawrence Dibble was a theater teacher at The Wellington School in Columbus, Ohio and committed his crimes between 2003 and 2006

It was her complaint to police that led to Dibble being arrested and investigators finding videos of her and another 19 students that he had filmed from 2003 and 2006.

Alexandra Vickery, who graduated in 2006, said that naked pictures that Dibble took of her when she was a child still continue to haunt her.

Fighting back tears, Vickery said that she when her children attend school, she 'will question every moment that they spend with a teacher. I will wonder if their school is a safe place...The terror will never go away.'

Another victim, Payton Cohn Thompson testified that she still has nightmares about Dibble and has to take anti-anxiety medication.

Sentenced: Judge Tim Horton said it was important that Dibble was removed from society

Pastor Darin Shaw of Christ¿s Church of Amherst said that Dibble has been attending his church for about three years

'It’s not fair that the night before my wedding, I had a nightmare about him,' she said of Dibble reported the Dispatch.Com

'It’s not fair that when I woke up on the day of my wedding, he was the first person I thought of.'

Incredibly, a pastor at Dibble's church spoke on his behalf to try and lessen his sentence.

'His remorse and his regret over these offenses, his repentance is genuine,' Pastor Darin Shaw said reported 10TV.com.
