 Tragic: Faces keyboardist Ian McLagan, 69, died in hospital on Wednesday after suffering a stroke on Tuesday

Rolling Stones collaborator and Faces keyboardist Ian McLagan has died.  

The keyboardist passed away in hospital in Austin, Texas, at the age of 69 on Wednesday  after suffering a stroke just the day before.

A message on his website stated: 'It is with great sadness and eternal admiration that we report the passing of rock and roll icon Ian McLagan.

'Ian was a member of the Small Faces and Faces and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. He died today, December 3, 2014, surrounded by family and friends in his adopted hometown of Austin, TX, due to complications from a stroke suffered the previous day. He was 69 years old.

'His manager Ken Kushnick says, "He was a beloved friend to so many people and a true rock n roll spirit, His persona and gift of son impacted the music across oceans and generations."

'Ian's artistry, generosity and warmth of spirit touched countless other musicians and music fans around the world. His loss will be felt by so many.

'Ian was scheduled to begin a North American tour on Wednesday, opening for labelmate Nick Lowe.'

After the Faces - who changed their name from the Small Faces in 1969 when Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood joined - split in 1975, Ian began working as a session musician playing with artists including Bob Dylan, Billy Bragg, Bruce Springsteen and Chuck Berry.
