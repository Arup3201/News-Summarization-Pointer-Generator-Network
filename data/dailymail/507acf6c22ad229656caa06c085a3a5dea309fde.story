This Easter weekend, Australian families will indulge in tonnes of chocolate, millions of hot cross buns, and mountains of fresh seafood and meat.

According to Woolworths, their customers will purchase enough prawns that if laid out would stretch from Sydney to Cairns, a staggering 54 million hot cross buns, and a whopping 2,900 tonnes of Easter chocolate.

All that food needs something to wash it down, so FEMAIL have asked the experts to advise what tipple to pair with our favourite seasonal foods, from  seafood and lamb, to traditional Easter treats.

With the Easter weekend forecast for the balmy mid-twenties Celsius, Australians can still enjoy their favoured seafood lunches.

Sales of lobster, oysters, prawns and fish will increase by 80 per cent over the Easter holiday.

Peter Nixon, resident drinks expert at Dan Murphy's, has shared his top wine pairings, from budget options to mid-range and high-end, to drink with them.

Sweet and spicy: 'The spice component of cinnamon and nutmeg is harmonious with a classic Muscat', says Peter Nixon, drinks expert at Dan Murphy's

PRAWNS

'Thrillingly juicy, lime-juice and lemongrass-scented dry Riesling with freshly peeled local prawns. Heaven!' says Peter Nixon.

OYSTERS  

'The crisp, minerally, citrussy zest of Margaret River Semillon Sauvignon Blanc is the perfect partner for freshly-shucked oysters,' says Nixon. 

For those on a budget, he suggests the MadFish Gold Turtle Semillon Sauvignon Blanc, which retails at $15, or for something a little more exuberant go for the Cullen Mangan Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc Semillon for $32.

HOT CROSS BUNS

Easter isn't Easter without a a fresh, warm hot cross bun smeared with butter.   

'The spice component of cinnamon and nutmeg is harmonious with a classic Australian Rutherglen Liquer Muscat,' says Nixon, pointing to Buller Fine Old Muscat as a wallet-friendly choice. 

Stanton & Killeen Grand Rutherglen Muscat, at the luxury end, will set you back $86.99.

CHOCOLATE

In the days before the holiday, before Sunday lunch, afterwards, and (for some) weeks after the Easter weekend, it is a veritable chocolate-fest in most households.

'Chocolate and richly-fruited spirity fortitied wines are just pure decadence' says Dan Murphy's Peter Nixon.

BLUE EYE COD AND TREVALLEY

If you are steering clear of meat on Good Friday, white fish is a popular choice. Nixon advises pairing it with Chardonnay.

'A richer, peach and cashew-nut style Chardonnay works a treat with white fleshed fish dishes' he says.  

Budget: Cockfighter's Ghost Hunter Valley (Australia) RRP$15.70

Mid-range: Domaine Astruc Chardonnay (France) RRP$15.99

SALMON

'As is the case most years, Salmon will be the number one selling seafood product over Easter,' says Adam Mourad of Woolworths. 

'An intense, crunchy Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc is the perfect palate cleanser for richly flavoured salmon' adds Peter Nixon.

Mid-range: Peter Yealands Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc (NZ) RRP$12.50

LOBSTER

For those splurging on luxurious lobster at their Easter lunch, the drinks will need to stand up to the decadent meaty seafood.

'The most luxurious of seafood dishes cries out for a world-class, bottle-fermented sparkling' says Nixon. He recommends the 2004 Taittinger Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs, which costs an eye-watering $299.

For those looking for a budget option, France's Sieur d'Arques Grande Cuvée 1531 de Aimery is a steal at $15.70.

Budget: Borsao Selección Grenache Blend (Spain) RRP$11.99

Mid-range: Cirillo The Vincent Grenache (Australia) RRP$21.99

Luxury: S.C. Pannell The Vale Shiraz Grenache (Australia) RRP$38.99
