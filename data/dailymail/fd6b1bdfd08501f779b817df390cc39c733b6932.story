Days after Barack Obama carefully selected his favorite (and most flattering) pictures of himself in 2012, comes another glut of photographs from the White House.

Obama, always a savvy operator when it comes to capturing the touching or comic shot which wields most political power, is seen in another round-up from 2012. 

The pictures were selected by official White House photographer Pete Souza, some of which have never been seen before, and uploaded on to Flickr today.

Serious commitments: Barack Obama flies from Kabul back to Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan on May 1 after a meeting with the country's president Hamid Karzai

Commander-in-chief: The President hugs three-year-old Arianna Holmes before taking a departure photograph with her whole family in the Oval Office on February 1

Special brew: The President gives one of his White House beers to a Coffee Connection customer in Knoxville, Iowa - who looks delighted with the gift

Hang time with the A-list: (Left to right) Don Cheadle, Obama, Tobey Maguire and George Clooney take a break from the basketball court as Clooney's girlfriend Stacy Keibler and two of Clooney's long-time friends look on

They capture the commander-in-chief in 
tense moments on a trip to Afghanistan along with giving hugs to young 
supporters and sitting with his arm around First Lady Michelle at a friend's Chicago wedding.

Obama is seen with his head bowed deep in thought as he flies in a blacked-out helicopter with military personnel over Afghanistan on May 1.

The seriousness of some duties are contrasted by lighthearted snaps where the President hugs a young visitor to the White House and hands out some specially brewed, White House beer to a fan in Knoxville, Iowa.

The President is also captured gazing lovingly at his wife Michelle as they attend a friend's wedding in Chicago along with joining in prayers with the family of a wounded service man at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

Pete Souza, along with several other White House official photographers, have a back catalogue of hundreds of images as Obama enters his second term.

Souza's work is partially responsible for Obama's carefully-crafted public image - from the authoritative shot of him watching Osama bin Laden's capture to playful pictures of the President pulling pranks on staffers and joking around with children of White House employees.
