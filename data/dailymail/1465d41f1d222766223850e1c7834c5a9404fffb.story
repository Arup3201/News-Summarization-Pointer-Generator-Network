Ex-Team Sky rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke's two-year ban from cycling was upheld after UK Anti-Doping rejected his claim that irregular blood samples were the result of an alcohol binge.

Tiernan-Locke's ban was confirmed by UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) on Monday, a month after it was announced by the International Cycling Union (UCI). Sky terminated his contract after the UCI's announcement on July 17.

The 29-year-old was found to have breached anti-doping rules when anomalies were found in his biological passport based on samples taken in September 2012.

He was asked to explain those anomalies at a hearing last month, where he claimed he had gone on a drinking binge with his girlfriend to celebrate securing a two-year deal with Team Sky.

According to a doctor presenting evidence on behalf of Tiernan-Locke, he consumed around 33 units of alcohol in a period of six hours on the evening of September 20, which then resulted in dehydration ahead of the sample being taken on the morning of September 22.

The UKAD statement said 'the explanation provided by the rider...did not sufficiently explain the abnormal values obtained from the sample'.

Tiernan-Locke's ban, which runs until December 31 2015 was therefore upheld, while he has been stripped of his 2012 Tour of Britain victory and his 19th place at the 2012 UCI Road World Championships.
