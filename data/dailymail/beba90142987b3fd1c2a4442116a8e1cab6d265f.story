At first glance it looks like a blur of colour, but this incredible image actually shows all 250,000 rivers running through America.

Not only that, it also reveal which direction they run in.

Researchers created the incredible maps from data created by the US Geological Survey.

Brooklyn designer Andrew Hill created the amazing map using data created by the US Geological Survey of all 250,000 rivers running through America.

The longest river on the map is the Missouri at 4088 kilometres. 

But the biggest in terms of water volume is the Mississippi, which is deeper.

At 1114 kilometres, the Yellowstone is the longest un-dammed river in the US. 

It was created by Brooklyn designer Andrew Hill of data-visualisation firm Vizzuality.

He used theCartoDB platform and the National Hydrography Dataset, which is made available online by the US Geological Survey, to create the map. 

'There are 18 distinct colours around the compass,' says Hill, who also works for CartoDB.

Pink, for example, represents a river that runs north-south or south-north. 

CartoDB is a  a cloud based mapping, analysis and visualization engine that lets users build spatial applications for both mobile and the web, and it often used on property websites and new sites to create maps.

Recently, the firm made its technology available for free. 

'We realized that charging for map views was actually penalizing you for creating interesting maps,' said Hill.

'We no longer want you to have to worry about unexpected traffic or what happens when the maps on your account go viral.
