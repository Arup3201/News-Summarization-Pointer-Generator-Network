A Texas man who worked at least eight years as an executive for the Boys and Girls Club of America has been arrested after going on the run for allegedly having sexual contact with a child.

Michael Patrick Spencer, 43, accused of sexual contact with a minor under the age of 13, had served as the children charity group's executive in Dallas according to investigators.

He spent seven years with the group in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to their Texas affiliate in 2008.

Last week a New Mexico Crime Stopper website published his photo leading to his arrest on Tuesday.

Albuquerque police have not said if the charge occurred during his work with the BGCA or was in any other way involved.

In a BGCA statement obtained by CBS DFW, the children's organization said they will cooperate fully with authorities in their investigation.

'Child protection and safety is the number one priority of Boys & Girls Clubs. The organization is committed to the highest standards of ethical behavior and integrity, and does not tolerate inappropriate or illegal activity on the part of any staff member, board member or volunteer,' they said.

Spencer was arrested on Tuesday at his current workplace, the Dallas-area chapter of the Alzheimer's Association.

The association released their own statement to CBS stating their staff being 'shocked and saddened by the allegations.'

They report Spencer on a leave of absence until the investigation is resolved.

Online jail records don't list an attorney for Spencer, who was freed on Wednesday on $20,000 bond.
