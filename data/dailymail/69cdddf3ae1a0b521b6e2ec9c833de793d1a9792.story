Ladies' Day is as much about excited racegoers pulling on their fancy frocks and eye-catching super-sized hats as it is about the racing itself.

And year in, year out, it never fails to disappoint as ladies - and celebrities, including The Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Harry - flock to Ascot for one of the most hotly-anticipated events on the racing calendar.

There are the inevitable runners, riders, fallers, dazzlers and, of course, fashion faux pas. But it always proves to be a treat for the eyes of those unable to make it there themselves.

On the track, hot favourite Leading Light landed the feature race of the meeting, the Ascot Gold Cup.

Last season's St Leger winner took the Group One prize over two-and-a-half miles from the Queen's horse and last year's champion, Estimate.
