A fascinating map of Twitter use over the U.S. shows how the story of Michael's Brown death and the subsequent unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, spread from a local story to intense national scrutiny.

The map was created by Twitter's data team, who used mentions of the city and related keywords to track the story's progress across America.

The resulting map visualizes the story as tiny blips in the Midwest before becoming a serious of bright yellow explosions that almost cover the country.

A Twitter data team has mined user mentions of Ferguson and Michael Brown to show how the midwest teen's tragic death went from local story to world news

Using mentions of Brown and Ferguson Twitter shows how the story began to light up the map

It only took three days for the local tragedy to go from a few online blips on Aug. 9 to covering the country on Aug. 11.

As the Atlantic's CityLab notes,the activity seems to spike immediately after local police arrested journalists Wesley Lowery and Ryan Reilly on Wednesday.

Writing for CityLab, Kriston Capps observed: 'Judging by the procession of the progress bar, it's late-ish into Aug. 
13 when Twitter goes nuclear, right around the time that the two 
reporters were arrested.'

Twitter mentions of Ferguson spiked as police and protestors clashed, especially following the arrest of several journalists

Graphic images like the Brown's lifeless body have been widely disseminated by Twitter users

And Huffington Post adds that Twitter's ability to influence ideas is no more evident than in the number of widely-adopted hashtags being used to transmit what are now considered the definitive images of the conflicts between demonstrators and local police.

Twitter users were ignited again Friday when Ferguson police finally identified Officer Darren Wilson as the man who shot Michael Brown.

In the same day, Brown was also identified as a suspect in a robbery, thought it was added that Wilson was unaware of Brown's possible connection to that crime when the two met.

Ferguson police have said that initially Wilson stopped Brown for walking in 
the middle of the street, but as he drove away, the officer 'made the 
connection' between the teen and the grocery store robbery, reported USA Today.
