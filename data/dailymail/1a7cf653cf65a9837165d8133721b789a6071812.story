A killer who stabbed his flatmate to death and then dumped her body in a suitcase at Heathrow before fleeing the country was jailed for at least 24 years today.

Youseff Ahmed Wahid, 42, fled to Lebanon to escape justice after he slit the throat of 28-year-old Fatima Kama and stabbed her repeatedly more than 12 years ago.

He finally faced trial at the Old Bailey after a decade-long battle by British police to return him to the UK.

Wahid, of no fixed address, denied murder.

Judge
Paul Worsley QC sentenced Wahid to life imprisonment and ordered he 
serve at least 24 years before he can be considered for parole.

Judge Paul Worsley told Wahid: 'You are an intelligent but devious and manipulative man.

'There is indication of significant physical suffering before her death. You callously concealed her body in a suitcase.

'I am entirely satisfied that your intention was to kill. There has been no flicker of remorse shown by you.

'You have refused to participate in proceedings and have refused to come into the court, believing mistakenly that you could abort the trial thereby.

'Justice is not so easily thwarted. You have done your utmost to avoid conviction for her murder. You have failed.'

Miss Kama's body was found at 10.30pm on September 17, 1999, the same night she was set to fly home to Montreal.

Wahid was captured on CCTV lugging a 
heavy suitcase through Paddington station and heading on a Heathrow 
Express train.

Two women discovered the suitcase at Heathrow Airport and a security guard opened it to Miss Kama's body curled up in a foetal position.

She had been robbed of expensive jewellery and more than £40,000 she had been carrying.

Within hours of the grisly discovery, Wahid fled to his native Lebanon after paying £457 cash for a one-way ticket at the same airport the next morning.

Miss Kama, a petite and attractive Moroccan-born Canadian national, was only identified on Monday September 19, once friends in London and family in Canada had reported her missing.

By the time officers visited the small flat in Marylebone, she had shared with Wahid, a former airline steward, he had already fled.

The tidy flat initially bore 'no sign of a struggle, let alone the sign of murder', but careful examination revealed blood-soaked carpet and smears on walls behind furniture.

Detectives travelled to Lebanon but quickly discovered there was no prospect of being able to extradite him back to the UK.

He settled with his family in the town of Ramadiyeh, but police continued to build their case against him.

With new information provided by Scotland Yard he faced trial at a Lebanese court and was eventually sentenced to death.

Before the case began Wahid fled the country and set up a new life in Bahrain.

Police traced Wahid to the Gulf State in November 2009, where he had settled believing he would be safe from the British authorities.

Detectives began the first ever extradition bid from Bahrain in British history and in August last year Wahid was arrested there.

He remained 'indignant' and insisted he had never travelled to London in his life, but was trapped when officers produced matching fingerprints taken from the Marylebone flat.

He told a Scotland Yard officer 'you are going to have to give me a big apology'.

He was returned to the UK on September 8 last year, where he was arrested at the same airport where Miss Kama's body had been dumped.

Legally aided Wahid, who has 
had three firms of solicitors representing him, then sacked his 
barrister as the trial got underway and refused to attend court so the 
jury, unusually, did not hear prosecution or defence closing speeches.

But Wahid, who has since 
married and had two children, was in the dock as the Old Bailey jury 
found him guilty of murder by a majority of 11 to one after just under 
two-and-a-half-hours.

Prosecutor Adrian Darbishire said: 'The long arm of Scotland Yard did not rest and leave matters there.

'Although years went by discreet efforts were made to keep tabs on Wahid because it was hoped that somehow, at some point, the opportunity might present itself where by he could be brought to a court in England to face the charge of murder committed in England.'

Scientists were able to link Wahid's DNA to semen found inside the dead woman's body.

Miss Kama, an aspiring cabaret singer and dancer, was described as a 'Holly-go-lightly' character who had come to London to launch a career in showbusiness.

Mr Darbishire said: 'It is clear Fatima was a vivacious, attractive young woman, who had a number of admirers.

'She was a dancer and something of a night-owl. Some of her admirers were extremely rich and generous to her.'

Miss Kama had rented the small flat from Wahid's younger brother.

She spent much of her time in the company of wealthy Arab men at some the city's finest hotels, restaurants and clubs  but Wahid was 'neither
rich nor seemed attractive to Fatima Kama'.

In a victim impact statement, Hasna 
Ould, Miss Kama's mother, said that 'nothing has changed - it is as 
though she died yesterday'.

She said: 'At birthdays and other celebrations we are weeping. I have no more tears to shed.

'I do not even know why the murderer did this or how he manages to sleep at night without feeling sorry.

'You must impose the maximum sentence you can.'
