They say the devil is in the detail.

But one horrified Christian mom  was left reeling after she saw, what she describes, as a detailed 'Satanic symbol' in the break lights of a school bus while driving through Cordova, Tennessee.

Robyn Wilkins from Memphis said she was stuck behind the bus in traffic when she was cursed with the sight of the  star-shaped red break lights in a circle which looked like a Satanic pentagram.

Devilish? This is the school bus which had the 'evil' Satanic pentagram symbol in its brake lights

Symbol: The 'Pentagram' is a symbol used by witches and Satanists for their own style of worship

Worried that she was being shown an evil sign as she drove through town, Wilkins snapped a picture of it and shared it with her local news station.

She told WMC Action News: 'Anyone who fears a God, if not God and Jesus Christ, should be outraged. If you can't put a cross on there, you cannot put a pentagram on it.'  

The 'Pentagram' is a symbol used by witches, Wiccans and Satanists. 

Some  Satanists and occultists have adopted it as their holy symbol, but other faiths use it as well.

Since her discovery, Wilkins has been joined by other local parents who believe that something sinister could be happening in the area - culminating in the takeover of taillights on school buses.

They have all taken to  social media to protest against the 'evil' brake lights on a government vehicle.

They're now calling for the lights to be removed from the buses and replaced with a single red bulb so that they can rest easily at nights knowing that they're no longer in use.

Wiccan: Jo Applewhite, pictured, said people needed to 'find out what it really means before getting riled up'

But one practicing Wiccan said that there is nothing to fear and everyone needs to calm down.

Jo Applewhite, a practicing Wiccan told WMC: 'Find out what it really means before you start getting riled up and all worked up about something.' 

Others argue that it was not a Pagan sign and was simply a red brake light. 

Durham School Services and The Shelby County School District declined to comment.
