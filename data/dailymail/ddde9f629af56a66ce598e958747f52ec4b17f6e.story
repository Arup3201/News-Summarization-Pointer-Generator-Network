They may look like a giant tennis ball, a huge burger and an over-sized toilet, but these are in fact road-legal cars handmade by an Indian inventor.

The wacky vehicles are the brain child of car lover Sudhakar Yadav, from Hyderabad, India, who has become famous around the world for his quirky vehicles.

He became hooked on his unusual hobby of building the bizarrely shaped cars during his school days, designing his first vehicle aged just 14. 

Anyone for tennis? Sudhakar Yadav poses next to his tennis ball car at Sudha Cars Museum in Hyderabad, India

Food machine: Mr Yadav proudly stands next to a car he has built in the shape of an aubergine

Hungry? The remarkable vehicles, including this car in the shape of a burger, have all been made from scrap

And to date he has created around 700 weird and wonderful cars - which include a double bed, a sofa, a giant cricket bat, a cigarette and a high-heeled shoe.

His entourage of automobiles is now so large, he has set up a museum, Sudha Cars Museum, to house them all.

Mr Yadav said: 'People love the cars that I make. We are getting around 1,000 visitors a day.'

Each one costs around £1,000 to £1,500 to make and are then displayed in road shows and exhibitions around India.

Loo roll: Despite their wacky appearances, the cars are road legal

Bat and ball: Mr Yadav said not one of the vehicles, including these cars in the shape of a cricket bat and a cricket ball, are for sale

Big break: Mr Yadav has now set up a museum to house his vast collection of vehicles

Sports mad: Mr Yadav has created cars which mimic a range of sports

Fashion accessories: Mr Yadav with his family in cars shaped like a shoe, a bag, a make-up compact and lipstick

Who fancies a cuppa? The inventive Mr Sayad says he does not have any particular inspiration, he just builds whatever he feels like making

Mr Yadav said: 'I make them from scarp - junk basically. None of the cars are for sale because this is my passion and I don't want to commercialise it.

'I get lots of orders from all sorts of people, and lots of kids' birthday parties.

'I don't have any particular inspiration, I just build what I feel like making.

Health warning: One of Mr Yadav's cars, in the shape of a cigarette, makes its way down a road along with the other traffic

A good lie in: Commuters would be able to enjoy a lie in on their drive in to work with this car in the shape of a double bed

Hi-tech: Mr Yadav has so far created about 700 of the wacky vehicles since starting his hobby at the age of 14

Multi-purpose: This car can also be used as a dinning table

'I've been doing it ever since I was 14-years-old and haven't stopped for over 30 years now.

'Some people imagine that my family would be annoyed at the amount of time I spend on the cars, but my wife supports me very much.

'She even encourages me to move forward with my passion.'

Sit back and relax: One of Mr Yadav's cars, in the shape of a sofa, being displayed at a fair in Hyderabad, India

Fun times: Children enjoy a ride in a dinning table car at a fair in Hyderabad

Say cheese: A car in the shape of a digital camera gains plenty of attention as it makes its way down the road
