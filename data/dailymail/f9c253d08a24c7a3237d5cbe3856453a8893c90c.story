An infertile woman convinced her new husband to repeatedly rape her 15-year-old daughter so she could have another child.

Misty Machinshok, 33, has been jailed for 15 to 30 years for the abuse in which she 'coached' the pair on the best positions to conceive, and held her daughter's hand 'the first few times'.

She planned to tell friends and family that the teenager got pregnant with a stranger at a house party in their home town of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

Her 29-year-old husband Gary Machinshok, who she met through a website called onlinebootycall.com, will be sentenced this month after pleading no contest to raping the child 'every few days' throughout 2013.

Jailed: Misty Machinshok, 33, pleaded no contest to all charges for convincing her new husband to rape her 15-year-old daughter. The court heard it was a plot to have another child, as she is no longer fertile

He also admitted to sexually assaulting her 11-year-old sister but struck a plea deal which means he cannot be charged for it.

Prosecutor Nancy Violi called the crime 'the most heinous' she had dealt with in 14 years on the job.

The rape came to light when one of the girl's friends alerted a teacher who called police, Violi said.

Both victims are now in foster care.

Awaiting sentencing: Her husband Gary Machinshok, 29, whom she met on onlinebootycall.com, has admitted raping the girl 'every few days' in 2013, and sexually assaulting her 11-year-old sister

It is not clear why Mrs Machinshok is no longer able to have children.

In January, she pleaded guilty to rape, aggravated assault, conspiracy, child endangerment and other counts. 

Defense attorney Mary Deady conceded that her client had made 'a lot of bad decisions,' but said she was pleading guilty to protect the child from having to testify.

Mrs Machinshok' father, Bill Englert, also leaped to her defense to say her involvement in the rape was 'over-emphasized' by prosecutors, according to Inquisitr.
