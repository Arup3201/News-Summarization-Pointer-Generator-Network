The decorated Green Beret known as Lawrence of Afghanistan has claimed he was forced out of the military because of his push for U.S. troops to 'go native'.

For years Special Forces Major Jim Gant had been praised for battle skills, but in 2012 he was forced to take retirement over claims that he was drinking and giving fuel to tribal police.

He was also reprimanded for allowing his girlfriend - war correspondent and former Washington Post reporter Ann Scott Tyson - to live with him in a dangerous region of the war-torn country.

In an interview with ABC News, which will be shown on Nightline Friday, Gant has spoken of how he felt closer to the Afghan villagers he was living with, that Americans. 

The 44-year-old formed such a close bond with the Pashtun villagers he and his men were living alongside that he was made a tribal leader by the Mohmand tribe.

With his 
long hair, unkempt bear and flowing robes, Gant looked more like Osama 
bin Laden than a US military officer - but his command was successful 
and his fame as Lawrence of Afghanistan meant he was welcoming VIPS to 
his Mangwel base.

Senator
 John McCain and presidential candidate Mitt Romney were just some of 
the politicians who wanted to see first hand the unconventional success 
Gant, who was awarded the Silver Star medal for service in Iraq, enjoyed.

Despite the high-profile visits, none noticed that he had Scott Tyson living with him, in direct violation of military rules.

Gant won over his superiors in 2009, at a time when the U.S. feared it was losing the war in Afghanistan in 2009.

He wrote a 45-page pamphlet, One Tribe At A Time, which detailed how the U.S. could win.

He believed the only way to do this was to earn the loyalty of the 
country's Pashtun tribes - and he thought the way to do this was to go 
native.

The
 pamphlet so impressed Petraeus, who had been made commander in 
Afghanistan in 2010, that he encourage Gant to follow through with his 
theories.

'It
 wasn't about our weapons or our body armor... it was gonna be about how
 we treated them. And it worked. It worked in a big way,' said Gant.

He pushed for troops to drop their heavy armor and military fatigues for tribal dress, saying that as well as instill trust in locals, it also was more comfortable for his men.

'You could move further, you could move 
faster, you could run farther. You could take cover 
more quickly. You could carry more ammunition, you could carry more 
water. It was just an absolute no brainer,' he said.

After winning over the locals he was able to convince them to fight the Taliban.

He told them: 'Tell everyone you come into contact 
with, I did not come here to fight. I came here to help the people,” 
Gant told dozens of tribal police in one 2012 video Tyson shot. 

'But if 
someone wants to f***in’ fight, they know where I am.'

General David Petraeus 
visited Gant in 2011 and saw the level to which he had become accepted 
by the tribesmen, even becoming like a son to their chief, Malik Noor 
Afzhal, nicknamed Sitting Bull.

'Gant
 did go native. You go native so that the natives feel that you respect 
them and are comfortable with them and trust them, above all. And he 
really was adopted as a son by Sitting Bull... there was no question 
about the relationship between these two individuals. And that's what 
you want,' Petraeus said to ABC News.

'Jim had become more Pashtun than the Pashtuns,' Tyson wrote in her book.

But
 some thought Gant was going too native and whispered that he was 
becoming a Colonel Kurtz figure along the lines of Marlon Brando's 
character in the Vietnam film, Apocalypse Now.

Gant's theory of how to win the trust of Afghans was tested to its limit amid widespread anger after U.S. troops accidentally burned copies of the Koran in a separate province.

In violation of a country-wide order from his superiors to keep his post on lock down, Gant told his men they were to continue walking through the village.

In footage filmed by Scott Tyson as he briefed the men, Gant is heard saying: 'You're going to have to trust me. I'm putting your lives in my f****** hand and saying I'm going to protect you.'

He said despite orders to stay at their post, he intended to walk around the village to show that he trusted them.

Scott Tyson said: 'You must trust the people you're with, and therein lies your security. He lived by that.'

Gant also admitted to ABC that it was sometimes safer to break the rules that to follow them while in Afghanistan.

Since being removed from the country in 2012, forced to shave, and then stripped of his military honors, Gant has been living in Seattle, Washington.

He returned with Scott Tyson to the Afghan village they had lived in for so long two years ago, and was greeted like family.

Footage shows villagers embracing Gant and firing their weapons into the surrounding hills in celebration.

Gant described it as 'happy gunfire' and said: 'Music to my ears, yes... and it was saying, "I love you and I miss you".'

it was a more welcome response than his final dealings with the military, who had condemned him for being a 'disgrace' - a charge he says causes him the most pain after all the success he enjoyed.

Gant's 
commanders claim to this day that they had no idea that the Green Beret 
was keeping a woman the Taliban openly referred to in radio 
communications as 'his wife' by his side - against all rules and 
regulations.

Dismissed: When the military found out about Gant's history of drinking and his affair with Tyson they airlifted him out of Mangwel

Despite
 their love affair, Gant had endured constant fighting in Mangwel for 22
 consecutive months and had developed a problem with drinking and pain 
killers.

Drinking in Afghanistan is against army rules as is conducting ongoing relationships during warfare.

In
 confidential files revealed by Tyson and Gant, the major was relieved 
because he 'indulged in a self-created fantasy world' supported by his 
'wife'.

He was stripped of his Special Forces honors, demoted to captain and made to retire.

We both 
knew that there was a lot of risk in doing what we did. And I would do 
it again,' Gant told ABC News this month in his first television 
interview.

'It was extremely unconventional, yes, to say the least.'

In that interview, Gant admits he drank, took drugs and kept Tyson with him - all against regulations.

However,
 he claims that his superiors were aware he was not a by-the-book 
soldier and luminaries such as retired Petraeus were 
supporters.

'I
 never left the battlefield defeated. I never lost a man. Well over 20 
awards for valor for the men that I fought alongside. We went after ‘em 
every single day. I brought all my men home. That’s it,' Gant said.

Indeed, Petraeus still calls Gant, Lawrence of Afghanistan - a comparison that Gant was keen to play up to.

Despite
 all that has happened, Gant and Tyson, who married last year, have come
 forward to tell their story in Tyson's new book, American Spartan: The 
Promise, The Mission And The Betrayal of Special Forces Major Jim Gant.

In March, Roberts filed a statement accusing Gant of 'immoral and illegal activities and actions' and said he was often 'intoxicated and under the influence of pain medications.'

Gant admits this, claiming he was suffering PTSD brought on by his constant services.

'I was drinking alcohol, I was taking sleeping medication. I was taking pain medication,' Gant explained in the ABC News interview.

'I admitted to that. And they came in. They came in and got me out of there.'

He was airlifted out immediately and made to shave his beard and wear his uniform.

'I would have rather been in the hands of the Taliban at that point,' he said. 'It was crushing. It was absolutely crushing.'

He was flown to Fort Bragg, North Carolina where his Green Beret status was stripped and he was demoted to Captain.

His superior officer Lt. General John Mulholland delivered what Gant saw as the killer blow.

His reprimand labeled Gant a 'disgrace' with no 'moral character', having 'indulged in a self-created fantasy world.'
