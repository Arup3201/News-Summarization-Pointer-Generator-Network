Last week this column ventured the view that English cricket was in denial. So we need to be careful how we tread after a 266-run win over India at the Ageas Bowl that was so complete it lacked only the sight of Ravindra Jadeja publicly forgiving Jimmy Anderson for whatever it was that happened in the Trent Bridge pavilion three weeks ago.

The good news for England is the bleeding has been staunched, and several of the themes that contributed to the mood of self-denial have been remedied – not least the response of the senior players, the runs of Alastair Cook, his use of Moeen Ali’s off-breaks, and the wicketkeeper.

The curmudgeonly news is that India appeared to have left their heads and hearts at Lord’s, a result that – if they are not careful – will leave them misty-eyed for longer than it takes to complete the series at Old Trafford and The Oval.

What a relief: England, including captain Alastair Cook (second left) celebrate on the way to victory

India were not merely poor in Southampton. They were crushingly anonymous. From the moment MS Dhoni went on the defensive on the first afternoon, they conveyed to England an interest in damage limitation only. And, offered the chance to trample all over Dhoni’s hospitality – a trait well-known to Indian fans during their pre-Lord’s three-year drought away from home – England quietly thanked him.

The upshot of both that, and Jadeja’s obliging drop at third slip when Cook had 15 – the kind of moment that can change a career – was that each of England’s seniors made the impact demanded of them in advance.

Cook’s double of 95 and 70 not out recalled the salad days when he would tuck into buffet seam bowling for fun (Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami are skilful operators, but they look knackered). Somehow, India bowled England’s run machine back into form.

Ian Bell, spared a first-innings duck by India’s continued refusal to countenance the DRS (of which more below), late-cut as if this was the 2013 Ashes all over again.

Then there was Stuart Broad and Anderson, sharing eight wickets in the first innings, before Anderson took control once more on the final morning. Their confidence stemmed in part from the 569 for seven England racked up with the help of India’s fatalism in the field. Such things are all part of the jigsaw.

With the four oldies all chipping in, the youngsters were able to go about their business, unencumbered by the concern that everything depended on them – like children trying to hold things together in a divorce.

Gary Ballance could be removed only by umpiring error, Joe Root battered a second-innings 50 from 38 balls, Jos Buttler chanced his arm gloriously and assuaged fears about his ability with the gloves, and Moeen looked suspiciously frontline rather than part-time.

Encouraging though this all is, the fact remains that England have won only one of their last 11 Tests, and could still lose a home series to a team that travels less well than camembert. Some of their dominance at the Ageas Bowl was down to the opposition.

Jumping for joy: Man of the match James Anderson was one of the senior players who backed up the captain

As for Cook’s captaincy, which – more than his batting – persuaded this column to suggest he was no longer up to the job, it drew on his runs like an old friend feeds off another after months of separation. Suddenly, we were marvelling at the fielding and bowling changes – the hunch on Root that produced the wicket of Shikhar Dhawan on Wednesday evening, and the gully brought in moments before Kumar was caught there on Thursday morning.

Such can be the nature of leadership. Cook did not suddenly wake up a tactical genius – and his hopes of victory in this series could depend on how well the ECB’s lawyers manage to defend Anderson today. But he was spot on when he lauded England’s ‘perfect Test’.

Before this series began, we feared a clash shot through with mid-table mediocrity, and so far the sides have traded blows accordingly. Both were neutered by Nottingham’s answer to the Nullarbor Plain, before England imploded at Lord’s and India surrendered in Southampton.

Since momentum is the most over-rated concept in international sport (a clue: it doesn’t actually exist), trying to predict what happens next is futile. Suffice to say that England are in less denial than they were this time last week, while India need to wake up quickly.

On a pitch laden with runs, 10 of their batsmen passed 20 yet none made 55. Even Ajinkya Rahane, who alone stood firm on the final morning, deserved a quiet talking-to after hitting a Moeen long hop straight up in the air on the third evening. And if they continue to ignore Ravichandran Ashwin, England will be thrilled.

It’s only one Test. But Cook’s England needed to start somewhere. 

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS

Groan Pt XXVIII

The word for a while now has been that, some time soon, India will withdraw their opposition to DRS, thus minimising the chances of an international cricketer’s career being ruined by a duff decision. But when MS Dhoni was asked whether events at the Ageas Bowl – where both sides suffered howlers – had changed India’s stance on technology, he was unequivocal. ‘No.’

He enlarged on his view. ‘But there’s an interesting thing you know,’ he said. ‘There was a ball that clipped Pujara’s inner thigh but it showed that the ball hit the stumps. The ball went to wicketkeeper and it didn’t touch the bails at all. So that shows how accurate the DRS is.’

No review of their stance: MS Dhoni (centre) and India are still opponents of DRS

Was Hawk-Eye simply predicting what would have happened had the ball not been intercepted by Pujara’s inner thigh? That, after all, is the point of Hawk-Eye. But no matter: Dhoni had seen an incident that means matches involving India will continue to be blighted by human error. Sometimes, you really do despair.

D-day for Anderson

Why did Jimmy Anderson feel the need to get involved in a brief slanging match with Ajinkya Rahane on the fourth evening in Southampton, less than 48 hours before he was due to face Justice Gordon Lewis and relive Trentbridgepushandshovegate? Perhaps England had done too good a job in taking his mind off the hearing.

And yet it’s important that Anderson is tried solely on the basis of events in the Nottingham pavilion. Mystifyingly, the BCCI have been briefing that they are going after him partly because of his incessant sledging over the years – a stance that can only weaken their case. Anderson should have stopped abusing opponents years ago. But he must be convicted or acquitted because of what did or didn’t happen on Thursday July 10.

Save the players

Are cricketers such a bland lot that the world can’t contain its excitement when one of them gets a little political? Apparently so. One former England player suggested to me during the third Test that Moeen Ali’s ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’ wristbands were unhelpful for the team because of the attention they commanded.

He had a point – but only because corporate levels of banality are now the norm. Moeen didn’t save the world, but neither did it stop turning.

Farewell, then…

A colossus of a player called it a day last week, a man who bestrode one of the sport’s theatre of dreams for years, racking up the runs and entertaining a nation. Had he bowled, David Sales truly would have been Northamptonshire’s answer to Jacques Kallis. We’ll miss you.
