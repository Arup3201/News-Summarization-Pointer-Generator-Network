George Osborne is considering an extra squeeze on benefits to ensure no family can get more than £20,000 a year in state handouts.

Treasury aides confirmed that the Chancellor will examine the case for lowering the new benefit cap further if it proves effective in cutting the welfare bill and pushing the jobless into work.

The Government’s £26,000 cap came into force this week, despite Labour opposition.

The Mail revealed yesterday that further measures, including a limit on child-related handouts after the first two children and an end to housing benefit for the under-25s, are being considered.

Tory sources said Labour’s welfare spokesman, Liam Byrne, had opened the way for further benefit limits by complaining that workless families with six or more children would only be partially affected by the new cap.

Until they are transferred to the new universal credit, around 4,000 large families will see housing benefit deducted, but will still receive more than £26,000 in  other handouts.

Jobless lone parents with seven or more children or workless  couples with six or more children will therefore escape the full cap. An unemployed couple with 10 children, for instance, could still receive £41,000 a year  in benefits because of child-related handouts.

Labour insists the cap is too low for areas with high property prices, such as London, but Mr Byrne’s decision to highlight this anomaly will encourage the Tories to bring forward legislation limiting benefits for large families and challenge Labour to back it.

‘We are very surprised Labour wants to have this debate, given their out-of-touch opposition to the benefits cap, but now they have started it, there is a good argument for testing whether they’re willing to put their money where their mouth is,’ said a  Tory source.

‘Even if the Lib Dems cannot be persuaded to move further, a limit on child-related benefits could be implemented if Labour is really ready to support it.’ Mr Osborne is prepared to consider cutting the overall £500-a-week cap on benefits ‘based on evidence, not politics’, a source confirmed.

The cap was introduced this week based on the average  salary of £26,000, despite claims from Labour MPs and charities that much of the spending is on housing costs and it risks forcing many families into hardship.

Polls suggest many voters believe the cap should be even lower and Conservative MPs have suggested it should be cut to £20,000, arguing that workers would have to earn £35,000 before taking home £26,000 after tax. Cutting the cap to £20,000 could save a further £840million a year.

Brooks Newmark, a Tory MP on the Commons Treasury committee, said: ‘Many people would be in favour of bringing it down to the real average post-tax pay.’

His colleague Chris Skidmore, the MP for Kingswood, said: ‘The cap remains very high at a time when many people are working and earning less than that.

‘In the longer term, a cap of £20,000 would better reflect  average wages.’

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said yesterday that in the four London boroughs where the cap had been piloted, a ‘very, very significant number’ of people in affected households had returned to work.
