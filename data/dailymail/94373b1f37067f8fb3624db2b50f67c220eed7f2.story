David Moyes arrived in San Sebastian on Wednesday ahead of signing his contract with Real Sociedad.

The former Manchester United boss is expected to pen an 18-month deal with the La Liga side.

His new club tweeted a picture of Moyes following his arrival in the coastal city with the message: 'David Moyes has arrived in San Sebastian! #WelcomeMoyes.'

The 51-year-old Scot is looking to rebuild a reputation damaged by his disappointing spell at Old Trafford.

He succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson at United in the summer of 2013, but was shown the door just 10 months into a six-year contract with the Red Devils.

Moyes inherits a Real Sociedad side that sit 15th in La Liga.

Sociedad dismissed coach Jagoba Arrasate on November 2 after a dismal start to the campaign. 

The ex-Everton man will be keen to implement his tactics on a struggling side immediately

Moyes was sacked as boss of Manchester United last April after less than a year in charge

The San Sebastian-based club - who finished fourth in 2013 and seventh last term - won just one of their opening 10 league fixtures.

Moyes' first game in charge will be the trip to newly-promoted Deportivo La Coruna on November 22.

The ex-Preston tactician becomes the fourth British manager of Real Sociedad, following in the footsteps of Englishman Harry Lowe and Welsh duo John Toshack and Chris Coleman.
