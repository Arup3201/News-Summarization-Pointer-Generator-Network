A Pennsylvania arbitrator has ruled that Jerry Sandusky’s $4,900-a-month Penn State pension be reinstated, including back payments from October 2012, when his child molestation conviction prompted the state retirement system to end his benefits.

Hearing examiner Michael Bangs wrote in an opinion dated Thursday but made public Monday that it was clear the former assistant football coach was no longer a Penn State employee after his 1999 retirement.

That was critical to the pension dispute because the state Pension Forfeiture Act was expanded five years later, in 2004, to add sexual offenses to the list of crimes that trigger forfeiture.

Flush with cash: A Pennsylvania arbitrator has ruled that Jerry Sandusky¿s $4,900-a-month Penn State pension be reinstated because he retired from Penn State back in 1999 - more than 12 years before his conviction

‘The Pennsylvania forfeiture law is simply not applicable to SERS’ members who commit crimes after they have begun receiving their pensions, which is really what SERS is attempting to do in this case,’ Bangs wrote. ‘The courts simply cannot extend the current law beyond any rational interpretation of its current form.’

Both Sandusky and the State Employees’ Retirement System can respond to the recommendation, after which the retirement system board will decide whether the pension should be reinstated. That could occur this fall, and if Sandusky loses he could appeal to state courts.

Pamela Hile, a spokeswoman for SERS, said Bangs' recommendation will go to the agency board for a final determination in ‘mid-to-late fall.’

If the board accepts Bangs’ recommendation, Sandusky’s Penn State pension would be reinstated to Oct. 9, 2012, when he and his wife, Dottie,lost the $4,900-a-month state benefit.

Sandusky, who retired in June 30, 
1999, as Penn State's defensive coordinator, was convicted in 2012 of 
molesting 10 boys over 15 years, some in the football team's showers on 
campus.

Bangs said that even
 though Penn State provided Sandusky with an office and telephone after 
his retirement, he was not a ’school employee.’ He said there was no 
formal contract or agreement between him and the university.

Sandusky’s lawyer, Chuck Benjamin, said Monday he was pleased with the ruling, which accepted Benjamin’s argument that a report by former FBI director Louis Freeh was incorrect when it claimed Sandusky received 71 post-retirement payments from Penn State.

In fact there were just a handful, and half were travel reimbursements, Benjamin said.

‘The unfortunate thing here is that SERS acted on the mistaken belief that the Freeh report was correct when the undisputed evidence showed it wasn’t correct,’ Benjamin said.

Sandusky testified in January on the pension issue by video link from a state prison in southwestern Pennsylvania. He was the only witness his lawyers called.

His pension benefits include a 50 per cent survivor’s annuity for Dottie Sandusky.

The 70-year-old Sandusky is serving a 30- to 60-year state prison sentence after being convicted two years ago of sexual abuse of 10 boys.

In a separate development on Monday, Pennsylvania's attorney general released a highly anticipated review of the Sandusky prosecution but found no evidence of political interference by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett during his time as attorney general.

The report, however, has revealed three years of 'inexplicable delays' to prosecute the former Penn State football coach on child abuse charges.

The pedophile's home was not searched and the report notes that it took a full year, from March 2009 until March 2010, for the office to recommend charging Sandusky when 'Victim 1' came forward.

It took more 18 months before Sandusky was arrested because veteran prosecutor Jonelle Eshbach was overruled from arresting her because her supervisors believed that the testimony of one victim would be 'insufficient against a community icon like Sandusky'.

The report, commissioned by Attorney General Kathleen Kane and written by former federal prosecutor Geoff Moulton, blamed a three-year time lapse in filing charges on communication problems, an expungement of a 1998 complaint about the former Penn State coach and a failure to take certain investigative steps early on.

Two days after Tom Corbett was elected governor in November 2010, the Centre County prosecutor received an anonymous tip directing investigators to assistant football coach Mike McQueary, whose testimony would eventually help convict Sandusky.

The 
investigation picked up steam after that, and authorities subpoenaed key
 figures at Penn State, including Paterno, vice president Gary Schultz 
and athletic director Tim Curley.

Additional
 victims were identified, and on June 21, 2011, Sandusky's home was 
searched, producing photos and typewritten lists of children who 
participated in events at Sandusky's charity, The Second Mile, with some
 names highlighted.

The university eventually accepted a set of penalties from the NCAA over its handling of the matter, including a four-year bowl ban, a temporary reduction in football scholarships, the loss of 112 wins from Paterno's later years and a $60 million fine.
