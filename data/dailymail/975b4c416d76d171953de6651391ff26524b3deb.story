A young Chinese woman has become the focus of an online hate campaign in China after she jokingly posted images of herself boiling a cat and using the remains to make soup.

Li Jinbang's uploaded the disturbing pictures of her killing her friend's pet to Weibo, the Chinese version of Facebook.

But she quickly began receiving hate mail and threats from fellow users, and before she could delete the post, the images went viral.

Cruel: The woman, who lives in China's Guangdong province, posted the photos of the cat trapped in a cage before she cruelly boiled it and used the parts to make a soup

Initially, the woman just wrote: 'Hey look, I managed to catch a tiger and ate it.'

But she subsequently posted the pictures and explained how she had boiled the animal before stripping its fur and cutting it to pieces.

The images included the defenceless cat cowering in a cage before it was hung up, prior to being butchered.

It also showed the young woman wearing a 
fur coat and glasses while she prepared the soup.

After being bombarded with emails, 
including hate messages, she tried to defend herself by saying  the cat, which in the images looked perfectly healthy prior to 
being boiled, had been badly injured in a car accident and she was 
simply doing a friend a favour by putting it out of its misery.

She said: 'It was a perfectly lawful killing and I killed the cat and ate it without doing anything illegal.'

Some users pointed out it was no surprise she was from southeast Chinaâ€™s Guangdong 
province, which is famous for its exotic eating 
habits, which often include unusual animal dishes.

Targeted: Li Jinbang received hate mail after the disturbing images spread over the internet after she uploaded them to social network site Weibo

China officially frowns on the process of eating cats, but estimated around 4million are eaten in the country each year.

In 2012, authorities drafted legislation to make the eating of cats and dogs illegal with jail sentences of up to 15 days for offenders.

But privately officials admit that the number of cats eaten is rising each year.

Authorities in China have considered making the practice of killing and eating cats illegal for many years.

The legislation would have seen large fines and jail sentences handed out to those caught cooking the animals.

But restaurants in certain parts of the country still serve it up as a delicacy.

Overseas visitors to China rarely come 
across cooked cat, as it is mainly the fringe areas in cities and rural 
areas where it is popular.

In both Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, cat flesh is regarded as a good winter dish as it is believed to be capable of keeping the body warm during the cold winter months.

Some chefs have also claimed it is good for metabolism and helps those who eat it sweat in the summer.

Most parts of the cat are said to be edible including the feet which are used to make a special type of meat soup. The head is rarely used.

Cat meat is also used in the traditional 'dragon, tiger, phoenix' dish where the dragon is snake meat, the tiger is cat and the Phoenix chicken. It is especially popular as a dish for cleansing the body.
