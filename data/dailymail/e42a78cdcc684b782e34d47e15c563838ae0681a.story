Sommeliers are able to identify hundreds of flavours in wine, from woody notes to citrus bursts and chocolate undertones.

But now a nanosensor could be threatening their livelihood.

Dubbed 'mini-mouth', the sensor mimics the reaction that wine creates on a person's tongue to determine how the alcohol tastes and, in particular, how astringent it is.

The nanosensor, dubbed 'mini-mouth' (pictured) uses salivary proteins to mimic the reaction wine creates on a human tongue. It does this by measuring the molecules and chemical compounds. From this, it determines the astringency - and overall flavour - of wine

The technology was created by PhD student Joana Guerreiro from Aarhus University in Denmark.

Vineyard owners turn grapes into wine using a series of highly-controlled processes, designed to bring out the desired flavour in the product that ends up on the shelves.

An important part of the taste is known in wine terminology as astringency, and it is characterised by the dry sensation drinkers get in their mouth when they drink red wine, in particular.

The tannins in the wine bring out this sensation, which is often likened to biting into an unripe banana.

The sensor is a small plate coated with nanoscale gold particles.

On this plate, the researchers simulate what happens in a person’s mouth by first adding some of the proteins contained in saliva.

After this they add the wine.

The gold particles on the plate act as nano-optics and make it possible to focus a beam of light below the diffraction limit, making it possible to precisely measure something that is very small - down to 20 nanometres.

This makes it possible to study and follow the proteins, and to see what effect the wine has, and ultimately see the extent to which the small molecules have to bind together for the clumping effect on the protein to be set off. 

These are mixed with lots of tastes in the wine and feel both soft and dry.

Ms Guerreiro and her fellow researchers at the Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Centre (iNANO), Aarhus University, have now developed a nanosensor capable of measuring the effect of astringency in a mouth when people drink wine.

The sensor uses salivary proteins to measure the sensation that would be felt on a human mouth.

The researchers study how the proteins change in the interaction with the wine, and they can use this to describe the effect of the wine.

‘There is great potential in this,’ said the university.

‘Both for the wine producers and for research into the medicine of the future.

‘Indeed, it is the first time a sensor has been produced that not only measures the amount of proteins and molecules in your mouth when you drink wine, but also measures the effect of wine – or other substances – entering your mouth.’

The sensor additionally makes it possible for wine producers to control the development of astringency during wine production because they can measure the level of astringency in the wine at the start of the process.

These tests can only currently be achieved when the wine is ready, and only by using a professional tasting panel. This also comes with a level of human inaccuracy.

Until now, the focus has been on the clumping together that takes place fairly late in the process of wine-making, but with the sensor, researchers have developed a method that mimics the binding and change in the structure of the proteins, which typically happens during the early part of the process (stock image)

‘We don’t want to replace the wine taster. We just want a tool that is useful in wine production,’ said Ms Guerreiro.

‘When you produce wine, you know that the finished product should have a distinct taste with a certain level of astringency. If it doesn’t work, people won’t drink the wine.’

‘The sensor expands our understanding of the concept of astringency.

‘The sensation arises because of the interaction between small organic molecules in the wine and proteins in your mouth. This interaction gets the proteins to change their structure and clump together.’

She said that, until now, the focus has been on the clumping together that takes place fairly late in the process, but with the sensor, her team has developed a method that mimics the binding and change in the structure of the proteins, which typically happens during the early part of the process.
