Some Armed Forces reservists in Afghanistan are being paid six-figure salaries by the Government, it emerged last night.

Military rules state that if reservists’ pay works out less than they would earn in their civilian job, they can claim for extra cash, known as a Reservist Award.

So if a reservist works in the City, for example, the gap to be made up between the military pay and their civilian salary can be substantial.

Well paid: Some reservists members of the Armed Forces are being paid six-figure salaries because of rules that mean that if they earn less while serving, they can claim for extra cash (file picture)

Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that this year, eight reservists called up for duty were paid more than £100,000 for their tour.

One of these so-called ‘City soldiers’ was paid £135,000 – several times the pay of regular soldiers – despite only holding the rank of a junior officer.

Many of those paid six-figure salaries are understood to be members of the TA unit based in the City of London, the Honourable Artillery Company.

Others included members of the Royal Marine Reserve and the RAF Reserve.

The Reservist Award is intended to prevent those called up losing out financially because of their service – but some ministers believe the payments cannot be justified and the pay rules are currently under review.

An MoD source told The Daily Telegraph: ‘There will have to be a tightening up of the system to limit these costs. It doesn’t make sense to be mobilising junior soldiers on over £100,000 with the Government picking up the bill for their City salary.’

Several doctors and surgeons from the Army medical reserve were also paid more than £100,000 for tours in Afghanistan, with one paid £225,000.

Reservist pay rules are being reviewed as the MoD attempts to almost double the number of deployable reservists to 30,000.

An MoD spokesman said there was a ‘strict upper limit’ to the Reservist Award, adding: ‘A significant proportion of those in receipt of a large award will be medical experts who deliver world-class care to injured troops on the battlefield.’
