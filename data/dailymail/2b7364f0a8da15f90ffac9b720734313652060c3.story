Complaints: Gabriel Pakpourtabrizi, 25, is fighting to stop her council sending gifted son Christian Farrington, 7, to a special school

With his photographic memory and an IQ of 168, Christian Farrington is top of the class.

The eight-year-old – who taught himself to read at 18 months – has the academic ability of a child twice his age.

But Christian has been told that he will have to move from his primary school to a special school because he has autism.

Despite his brilliant progress at school, the local education authority has decided it is too costly for him to have teaching assistants there.

His mother, Gabrielle Pakpourtabrizi, 25, is taking legal action.

Miss Pakpourtabrizi, from Ely in Cambridgeshire, said: ‘Taking him out of the school he loves and putting him in a special needs school will pull the carpet from underneath him and completely ruin him.

‘He has surpassed everyone’s expectations and no child deserves to be taken away from a school that is working for them.’

Christian has attended Ely St John’s Community Primary School since he started school.

His mother first noticed her son’s abilities when he picked up a children’s book in a doctors’ waiting room as an 18-month-old toddler and read it aloud.

Experts say Christian has the academic ability of a 15-year-old but he has high-functioning autism, which means he can struggle with some social situations.

He has had a one-to-one teaching assistant at his school to help him deal with loud environments and busy classes.

Young and talented: Gabrielle says he boy Christian has an high IQ and a photographic memory, but moving him away from mainstream school will wreck his chances

Special: Christian's detailed drawings, including this one, led to him being diagnosed with autism

But the local authority now wants to 
move him to a school for children with learning difficulties after Ely 
St John’s  asked for funding for a second teaching assistant. Miss 
Pakpourtabrizi said he was thriving at school and the decision will see 
his progress stall and rare talents wasted.

She said: ‘What the council wants to do simply isn’t on and they would be depriving Christian of his opportunities.

‘The only reason they’re doing this is
to save money as they don’t want to have to pay to support Christian as
he progresses through mainstream school. What he’s achieving at his 
current primary school is priceless.

‘He will not be intellectually 
stimulated there (at a special school).

'I will be willing to back a 
change, but only if it is the correct one for my son.’

Miss Pakpourtabrizi has launched 
tribunal proceedings against Cambridgeshire County Council’s decision to
move him to Gretton School in Girton.

A Special Educational Needs and 
Disability Tribunal will decide if Christian should move to the special 
school.

If the appeal is unsuccessful, the case can be heard in the High
Court.

Miss Pakpourtabrizi has asked that if 
her son cannot  attend his local primary school that he go to a 
residential school for children with social, emotional and behavioural 
difficulties in Rutland.

A council spokesman said: ‘It is agreed that Christian requires specialist provision.

‘The county council has identified an
independent special school in the county which can meet his needs, but 
his parents have not accepted this.

Home: Christian is Ely St John's Community Primary School but the council want him moved elsewhere

'They have identified an alternative 
school, but due to its distance from his home, Christian would have to 
be a weekly boarder. We feel this is inappropriate for a seven-year-old 
[Christian turned eight yesterday].

‘His parents disagree and have lodged an appeal, which they are entitled to do.’

Ely St John’s school declined to comment.
