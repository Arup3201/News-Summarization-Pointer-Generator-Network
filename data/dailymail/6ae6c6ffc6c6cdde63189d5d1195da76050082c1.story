Britain's most hated woman has invited Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to a birthday party... for her NHS-funded boobs.

Controversial wannabe-glamour model Josie Cunningham revealed she will be throwing a bash for her breasts two years after the £5,000 operation.

And to show her gratitude for her enlarged assets, she took to Twitter to invite Hunt, MP for South West Surrey and Secretary of State for Health.

She tweeted: '@JosieCOnline @Jeremy_Hunt having a birthday party for my boobies at the end of the month. To show how grateful I am..... Wanna come??? Xxx'

Sadly, Hunt didn't reply.

Minutes earlier she had announced she would be throwing the party in London in 'a couple of weeks'.

Last month it was revealed Miss Cunningham would be the star of her own documentary on Channel 4 called 'The Most Hated Woman in Britain'.

Her agent announced the news on Twitter, although Channel 4 said the programme had not yet been finalised.

The 23-year-old shot to notoriety when she boasted about having a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS.

Anger over her shameless boasts grew when she claimed she considered aborting her child so she could appear on TV show Big Brother. 

In December, Miss Cunningham announced her engagement to Andrew Goy by sharing a photo of her pink heart-shaped engagement ring online.

The engagement, which was then confirmed by a representative for Miss Cunningham, comes just weeks after the couple were first pictured in Leeds city centre.

There have also been reports that Miss Cunningham is pregnant with Goy's child.

Last month, Miss Cunningham also revealed she had wrongly told one man that he was the father of her baby daughter by sending him the wrong DNA result.

She had asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day.

But the mother-of-three mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man.

Miss Cunningham shared her blunder with her Twitter followers before comparing her life to an episode of EastEnders.
