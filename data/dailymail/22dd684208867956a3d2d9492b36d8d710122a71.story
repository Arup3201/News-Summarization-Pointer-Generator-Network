For many, one of the most enjoyable parts of Christmas is gathering around a fir tree with family to spend a few hours decorating it with baubles, beads and treats.

But in one small town in Germany, this tradition means a little bit more, as it is where the first ever Christmas baubles were made.

While the glass balls bought today may have been manufactured in China, Mexico, or the USA, the originals were invented in Germany and a small 
mountain village of Lauscha is considered to be the birthplace of the 
handmade, glass-blown Christmas bauble.

The spirit of Christmas: A shop in Lauscha, in the German state of Thuringen, displays the locally produced Christmas baubles

Birthplace of the bauble: The family of Weschenfelder work on Christmas balls in their combined living room and work space in the small village of Lauscha

Still going strong: There are now 20 small glass-blowing companies in the mountain village of Lauscha in German Thuringia

In the late 16th century, Lauscha, in the German state of Thuringen, became known for its excellence in glass-blowing.

Lauscha, located in a river valley, had several elements needed for glass-making: timber, for firing the glass ovens, and sand.

In 1597, Christoph Muller and Hans Greiner set up Lauscha's first glassworks and very soon, Glashutten (glassworks) were established in the town.

Lauscha's Glashutten eventually produced drinking glasses, flasks, glass bowls, glass beads (Glasperlen), and in 1835, local glass blower Ludwig Muller- Uri invented the artificial human eye from glass.

The original decorations: The earliest hand blown Christmas tree ornaments from glass were attached to each other to form a chain

The factories in the town became state-owned while under the East German communist government

In 1847 Hans Greiner began producing glass ornaments in the shape of fruits and nuts.

The inside of the ornament was made to look silvery, at first with mercury or lead, then later using a special compound of silver nitrate and sugar water.

Soon these unique glass Christmas ornaments were being exported to other parts of Europe. By the 1870s, Lauscha was exporting its unique glass ornaments to Britain.

Glass ornaments had become popular in 1846 when an illustration of Queen Victoria's Christmas tree was printed in a London paper. The royal tree was decorated with glass ornaments from Prince Albert's native land of Germany.

Realistic: The glass masters of Lauscha could already make high quality, life like artificial human eyes in the 19th century

In the 1880s the American dime-store 
magnate F. W. Woolworth discovered Lauscha's Glaskugeln during a visit 
to Germany. He made a fortune by importing the German glass ornaments to
the U.S.

Unfortunately,
the end of World War II meant that East Germany's communist government 
turned most of Lauscha's glassworks into state-owned concerns and it 
wasn't until the Berlin Wall came down, that most of the firms were 
re-established as private companies.

Today
there are still about 20 small glass-blowing firms active in Lauscha 
and to celebrate this festive heritage, a famous Christmas Ball-market 
takes place every year which attracts thousands of visitors to this snow
topped picturesque location.
