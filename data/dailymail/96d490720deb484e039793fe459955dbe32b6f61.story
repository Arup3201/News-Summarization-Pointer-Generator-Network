Darrell Simester, 44, was allegedly kept as a slave working 15-hour days on a farm in Wales after running away in 2000

A mother has described the moment she saw her son for the first time in 13 years, saying he looked like an old man after allegedly being kept in captivity.

Cardiff Crown Court heard that Darrell Simester, 44, was kept in a rat-infested shed on a farm in Newport, south Wales, for a decade while being forced to work 15-hour days.

Daniel Doran, 67, and David Dan Doran, 42, father and son, are standing trial accused of forcing Mr Simester to carry out unpaid labour.

Speaking to the court today, Mr Simester's mother, Jean, recalled the moment she was reunited with her son for the first time in 13 years after a newspaper appeal.

The 63-year-oldsaid: 'He looked like a vulnerable old man. He did not look like my son at all.

'He was hunched over and and was more like a man of 90 than a man of 43.

'I just couldn’t believe it was my son.

'I asked him to show me where he’d been living. He took me to his caravan. It was disgusting. It was a disgrace.

'You wouldn’t have had an animal living there.' 

Jean told the court that Mr Simester was last seen in 2000 while he was living with the Loveridge family, near to her home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire.

However he ran away while the group were on holiday in Porthcawl, south Wales, after he got into an argument with Jimmy, the father of the family, who hit him. 

He was later picked up by a family member of the two defendants while walking on a dual carriageway, and went to work on their farm called Cariad - the Welsh word for 'darling'.

Mother-of-four Mrs Simester said: 'I had a phonecall a few weeks after I last saw Darrell saying he had been picked up by two men who offered him accommodation and a job.

'He said he had an argument with the (Jimmy) Loveridge, who had hit him over the head and he’d walked off.'

Mrs Simester said she had been reassured her son was going to be 'cared for and looked after' somewhere in Wales.

A jury heard Mrs Simester and her husband Tony kept in contact with their son by telephone and were initially given a phone number to call him on.

Mr Simester's mother, Jean, said that her son (left) regularly called her on her mobile to say he was being looked after until 2008, when she contacted the police 

However, Mrs Simester said the number began going 'to answerphone' and that her son started calling her from a withheld number.

She said: 'How many phonecalls would we receive from him? They would just be at random. They were two or three times a year - you might be lucky to get a fourth.

'What was my opinion as to what Darrell was saying in these calls? It wasn’t the truth...it wasn’t what Darrell would say.

'During a phone call in February 2006, he told me he was married to Mary and got a daughter called Lisa and there was another baby on the way....and he was living in Ireland.'

Mrs Simester said she asked her son for a number to call him on, but was told he was 'not allowed' to give one out. 

She said the last time she spoke to him was Christmas Eve in 2008 while her family were on holiday in Spain.

After the phonecalls stopped, Mrs Simester said she 'tried everything' to find out what had happened to her son.

'I’d spend hours on the internet, I got in touch with (charity) Missing People...the Salvation Army and the police.'

In 2012, a schoolfriend set up a Facebook page - which later lead to the family contacting a Welsh news site after learning their son may be in the Cardiff area.

The court heard that after a story was published about the Simesters’ bid to track down Darrell, they were taken to the gates of Cariad Farm after an anonymous tip-off.

The court was earlier told that Mr Simester's brother Duncan went into the farmyard and found a man shovelling manure, which he eventually recognised as his brother.

Duncan said Mr Simester was found in poor health, with a large hernia on his groin and scrotum, missing teeth, cystic swelling in his back, and burns on his legs. 

Mrs Simester said she was 'grateful' for the newspapers’ help, and agreed for a photographer to take a picture of the family together again.

She added: 'I wanted people to know what was going on in this world...that people are being held and being made to work for nothing.'

However,  once the story broke Jean said the family became 'pestered by the press' - and they decided to get in touch with PR guru Clarence Mitchell.

The court heard Mr Simester was paid £4,000 following an exclusive story for The Sun newspaper.

Mrs Simester was asked by Doran senior’s barrister Kevin Malloy QC why the money for that story was not in her son’s bank account.

She said: 'That money has been put aside for when Darrell needs it. If ever he needs a holiday or needs to buy him anything else it’s there for him. It’s not anybody else’s - it’s Darrell's.'

She also denied suggestions her son had a major gambling problem.

Earlier today, Mr Simester’s brother Duncan gave evidence saying his brother had been kicked out of a flat after falling behind with the rent.

Duncan also admitted that his brother’s return home had 'caused turmoil or difficulty' for his parents.

'There have been certain moments when things have not been 100% hunky dory,' Duncan said.

'Has he re-engaged his interest in going to the bookies? Yes.

'Did things get to a stage where I hit him? Yes....because I told him to stop gambling and he didn’t. He went down to the betting shop the next day. I had had enough of it.'

Duncan added he had an argument with relatives because he felt his brother should not be living with his parents.

'He’s 44 years old. He should not be living at home. He should be old enough to look after himself.'

The trial continues.
