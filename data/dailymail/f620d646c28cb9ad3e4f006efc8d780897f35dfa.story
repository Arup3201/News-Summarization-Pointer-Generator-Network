Buffering videos and slow downloads are the bane of the web, even in areas that promise superfast speeds.

But this could soon be a thing of the past after researchers created a network so fast - it could download a file in just 0.03 milliseconds. 

By comparison, the blink of an eye takes 300 milliseconds.

The advanced technology uses fibre with seven different cores to transfer 255 terabits of data every second.

Researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) have used a seven-core fibre network to transfer data at a record-high of 225 terabits per second (Tbps). Current fibre networks (pictured) typically use single cores and achieve a commercial maximum of 100Gbps

This is 2,550 times faster than the 100Gbps currently offered as the maximum achievable speeds on single-core, commercial networks.

And to put this into perspective, the average web speed globally is only a meagre 3.9Mbps.

The advanced technology fibre uses seven different cores through which light can travel, instead of the single core typically used.

During tests, its transferred 255 terabits of data every second. 

This is 2,550 times faster than the 100Gbps offered as the current commercial maximum. 

Put simply, it’s similar to sending thousands of cars down a seven-lane motorway, compared to a single-track road.

Researchers also introduced two additional so-called ‘orthogonal dimensions’ - the equivalent of driving three cars on top of one another in the same lane. 

The breakthrough was achieved by researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and the University of Central Florida (CREOL).

Their new fibre has seven different cores through which the light can travel, instead of the single core typically used in current state-of-the-art fibre networks.

Put simply, it’s the equivalent of sending thousands of cars down a seven-lane highway, compared to a single-track road.

The researchers also introduced two additional so-called ‘orthogonal dimensions’ - the equivalent of driving three cars on top of one another in the same lane.

By combining these methods, the network topped out at 255Tbps.

Lead researcher, Dr. Chigo Okonkwo said: ‘At less than 200 microns in diameter, this fibre does not take noticeably more space than conventional fibres already deployed.

‘These remarkable results definitely give the possibility to achieve Petabits/s transmission.’

However, these speeds were the maximum achieved in controlled tests. 

To achieve such speeds in the real world would mean upgrading routers, devices and websites to handle the extra demand.

The findings are published in the journal Nature Photonics.

These latest speeds build on the research from Technical University of Denmark which, in July, achieved 43Tbps using the seven-core fibre.
