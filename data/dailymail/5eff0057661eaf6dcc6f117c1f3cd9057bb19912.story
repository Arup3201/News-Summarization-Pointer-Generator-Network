Geologists have attacked Iain Duncan Smith’s claim that they are less ‘important’ than supermarket shelf stackers.

The Work and Pensions Secretary issued the rebuke after geology graduate Cait Reilly won a landmark court case against the Government’s back-to-work scheme, which involved work experience at Poundland.

He said: ‘The next time these smart people who say there’s something wrong with this go into their supermarket, ask themselves this simple question.

Professor Alan Lord, left, said he would be surprised if Iain Duncan Smith, right, though geologists were any less 'than equally vital to the economy as those who stack shelves'

‘When they can’t find the food on the shelves, who is more important: Them, the geologist, or the person that stacked the shelf?’

Now the Geological Society of London has voiced its ‘surprise’ at the minister’s comments.

Professor Alan Lord, the society’s secretary for foreign and external affairs, responded: ‘Without geologists, there would be no way to supply supermarkets with produce, no transport for customers or staff – no shelves, in fact.

‘Geologists are a vital part of that supply chain – mining the minerals essential for fertilisers, obtaining metal ores, discovering the fuel which transports produce to the store, and engineering our transport infrastructure.

‘We would be surprised if Mr Duncan Smith considered geology graduates anything less than equally vital to the economy as those who stack shelves.

‘Many geologists spend a lot of time 
in challenging conditions - on oil rigs in the North Sea, in trenches 
and mines, conducting field work in all weathers.

The Appeal Court ruling last week found the Government’s regulations failed to give claimants enough information, particular regarding sanctions they would face if they refused to work under the scheme.

But the court rejected the claim by Miss Reilly, who is from Birmingham, that being forced to do unpaid work experience was a breach of her human rights.

The 24-year-old said she was not objecting to doing menial work but to not being paid for it.

She is now working part-time in a supermarket.
