Johnny Sexton is on course to start Saturday’s Six Nations clash with Wales, a match that Warren Gatland is delighted to see Wayne Barnes officiate.

As Sexton and his hamstrings were coming through Ireland training unscathed, Wales coach Gatland was naming an unchanged team for the Millennium Stadium encounter and giving his seal of approval to English referee Barnes, an official with whom Wales ‘have a good rapport’.

Barnes was called in to take charge of the match after Steve Walsh was ruled out and Gatland said Wales were delighted to have the Englishman on the whistle.

‘We have had him before, he is a referee we have got a good rapport with,’ said Gatland. ‘The players get on well with him and we are really looking forward to him taking control of the game. I am looking forward to meeting him on Friday just to get his thoughts on the Six Nations so far and things that he is looking for from us.’

Sexton remains on course to start in Cardiff, according to assistant coach Richie Murphy.

‘He didn’t do any contact but took part in full training. He ran all the plays, did all the defensive stuff and was running at 100 per cent.

‘He’s really happy where he is at. We’re expecting him to be fit at the weekend.

‘He’s a really important part of the package,’ added Murphy.

‘His direction and leadership are massive, those decisions he makes on the run.

‘We’re really happy he will be fit to play at the weekend, but I suppose the back-up is the whole squad doesn’t rely on just Johnny.’

Murphy also confirmed Jamie Heaslip is good to go, stating the No 8 took a full part in Tuesday’s training after recovering from the three vertebrae fractured against France, while the assistant also clarified Monday’s concussion return-to-play protocol confusion surrounding Sean O’Brien and Jared Payne, who suffered bangs against England.

‘They can be cleared within six days if they’re playing the following week, but that process can take longer if you don’t need them.

‘Both have finished their return to play protocols and did contact training. An eye will be kept on them over the next 24 hours but both are fit and healthy and look like they’re ready to play.’

It means Joe Schmidt will deal from a full deck on Thursday when unveiling his team.
