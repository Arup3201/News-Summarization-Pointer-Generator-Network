Lori Moore and her new boyfriend Lance Griffel were attending a high school reunion in an Illinois sports bar on Saturday when her ex-husband walked calmly inside and fatally shot them both.

Incredibly, James Moore, 40, was prevented from committing mass-murder by a heroic off-duty FBI officer who shot the gunman dead at the Fifth Quarter Sports Bar and Pizzeria immediately after.

Moore, 33, and Griffel, 36, were both rushed to hospital where they were pronounced dead after suffering gunshot wounds to the head.

The tragic couple were attending an East Peoria Community High School reunion for the class of 1999 when Moore walked in around 8 pm and shot them both in front of 100 stunned witnesses.

'After just a brief moment inside the bar, he pulled out a weapon and shot a female and a male,' said East Peoria Police Chief Dick Ganschow to the Pekin Times.

'He was subsequently shot.'

Moore filed for a divorce from Jason A. Moore in March of 2013 and the dissolution of the marriage was finalized in May 2013.

In a June 5 Facebook post, Lori Moore posed happily for a picture with Griffel, giving him the moniker, Sir Lancelot.

Ganschow praised the quick thinking off-duty officer for their reaction to the shooter.

'It's very difficult to say. You can play the 'what if' game over and over again, but I think it's pretty clear in his case the presence of this officer and his ability to take very quick and very decisive action prevented a further tragedy,' said Ganschow.

Ganschow said the crime scene has been released, but will remain closed to the public.

Dozens of police responded to the shocking shooting and a couple were seen to be tearfully hugging on one side of the crime-scene tape.

Moore was pronounced dead at the sports bar at 10.50pm on Saturday and police said the incident is believed to have been domestic violence related as the shooting suspect was identified as the ex-husband of Moore, WEEK reported.

Police have not officially identified the gunman, and would not identify the off-duty officer or where the officer worked.
