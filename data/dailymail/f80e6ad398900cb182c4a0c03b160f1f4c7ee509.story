Five thousand fatherless children have been born to lesbian couples and single mothers following fertility treatment in the past decade (posed by model)

Five thousand fatherless children have been born to lesbian couples and single mothers following fertility treatment in the past decade, the Daily Mail can reveal.

The figure emerged on the day that it was announced that lesbians and older women are due to get free IVF on the taxpayer.

Women aged 40 to 42 will qualify for state-funded fertility treatment for the first time, according to the guidelines from the health spending watchdog NICE. Previously, the watchdog did not recommend IVF on the NHS for the over-39s.

And – despite fears the cash-strapped health service cannot afford extra burdens – women in same-sex relationships with proven infertility will also be able to get free IVF. Up until now, lesbian couples have had to pay privately for such treatment.

Campaigners warned that the ruling will create a generation of fatherless children – which was bad for both the youngsters and society as a whole.

Official figures show that in the past decade, a total of 4,899 children have been born following fertility treatment either to single women or lesbian couples.

The number of such births has surged since the law was controversially changed in 2008. 

The requirement that fertility doctors consider a child’s need for a male role model before giving IVF treatment or facilitating insemination was axed.

It was felt that the law discriminated against singletons and lesbian couples. Since that year, the total number of babies created without a father has almost quadrupled from 312 to 1,124.

This amounts to more than three births every single day.

Last night Norman Wells, from the pressure group Family and Youth Concern, said: ‘It was always inevitable that removing the legal requirement to consider the need of a child for a father would result in a rise in fatherless families. 

‘We should be no less concerned about the creation of children deprived of a father than we are concerned about other forms of deprivation suffered by children.

‘Research demonstrates that the absence of fathers has adverse consequences for children, for mothers and for society. Fathers are not an optional extra.

‘Not only will children suffer as a result of deliberately being brought into the world without a father in the home, but the law is sending out the dangerous message that fatherhood amounts to no more than sperm donation.’ 

Josephine Quintavalle, from the group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: ‘It is sad to see the role of the father increasingly diminished in this way.

‘Fatherhood and all the subsequent responsibilities and joy that come with the role cannot be fulfilled by an anonymous donation of sperm.’

The most recent annual data from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority shows that in 2011 there were 707 babies born to single mothers using either IVF or donor insemination, and 417 to women in a lesbian relationship.

The comparable figures for 2008 – when the law was changed – were 149 for single women and 163 for lesbians.

The data reveals only details of those women who were treated at a licensed clinic in the UK, so it is believed many so-called DIY donor inseminations are not officially registered.

Andrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, said: ‘Our approach to IVF and donor insemination should take account of the child’s needs, not just the desires of women who want children. 

‘Children have a right to a father as well as a mother. We can’t just airbrush dads out of the picture. ‘They are essential for children’s wellbeing. Many women do a great job of bringing up children single-handedly. 

‘But…we shouldn’t be intentionally creating circumstances where children miss out on having a dad.’ 

The shake-up of the NICE guidelines means women aged 40-42 failing to get pregnant after two years of trying, or 12 cycles of artificial insemination, should be offered one full cycle of IVF, if they have never previously had IVF treatment.

This could lead to some or all of around 8,000 women currently paying privately for IVF in their early 40s each year turning to the health service. 

Lesbians under 40 who fail to conceive after 12 cycles of artificial insemination – which could be paid for by the NHS – will then qualify for three cycles of IVF funding.
