It still clearly rankles with Steven Naismith that injury saw him miss out on a UEFA Cup final appearance with Rangers in what now seems like another dimension, never mind seven short years ago.

But the Scotland star has revealed that it’s the memory of that heartbreaking episode which is spurring him on to reach this season’s Europa League showpiece with Everton.

Roberto Martinez’s men host Dynamo Kiev tonight at Goodison Park in the first leg of their last-16 tie and the hosts are expected to progress against one of the competition’s lowest-ranked sides.

Naismith is determined to make up for that defeat, and missing the final, with Everton this season

Britain’s last remaining representatives in the tournament will have their work cut out to go all the way, with the likes of Wolfsburg, Napoli, Roma and Zenit also still in contention.

But Naismith is adamant they have what it takes to challenge for the club’s second continental honour after the Cup Winners’ Cup was claimed three decades ago - and are ready to go one step better than Rangers did in 2008 when they lost to Zenit St Petersburg in Manchester.

In his first campaign at Ibrox after leaving Kilmarnock, Naismith appeared as a sub in a crucial 1-1 draw at Panathinaikos that gave Walter Smith’s side an away goals victory. 

He was also among the replacements at Werder Bremen and in both meetings with Sporting Lisbon as the Scots kept progressing. 

But four days before the first semi-final with Fiorentina, he suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury in a last-four Scottish Cup tie with St Johnstone.

That ended Naismith’s quest for European glory. He was a spectator at the final and didn’t play again competitively for another nine months.

‘I played in Greece back then and was on the bench a couple of times afterwards but then I got injured at Hampden,’ recalled the 28-year-old.

‘I missed the semi-finals and the final and I remember watching the penalty shoot-out in Florence that took us through on TV and I didn’t feel 100 per cent part of it. It was a great feeling to see the team win but I hadn’t travelled and it wasn’ t great to feel I was missing out.

‘This is an opportunity to make up for that. There was still a great buzz from sitting watching the final from the sidelines in Manchester. It was fantastic but it also makes me think now I’d love to get that feeling again and hopefully go one better, play in the final and win it. That’s what drives me on.

‘It’s not just that I never got to play back then but also that I want to experience the feeling we had around the club from getting to the final in the first place. 

'This season when we’ve been playing in Europe, it has crossed my mind that the experiences I had with Rangers can help me, especially at this stage in the tournament.

The disappointment of seven years ago, and his failure to influence it, still haunts the Scotland striker

‘We had to be very resilient and well organised in 2008. Teams found it difficult to break us down and we did well to counter and create chances that way. 

'We rode our luck a bit as well and I look at that and think it was great we got so far. It’s something Everton can look to do now too and we’ve been similar.

‘In the group stage, things went flawlessly and we played every game perfectly. We were very solid in the last round against Young Boys as well.

'As things go on, we know it will get tougher and tougher but at this stage we feel we can go further and go as far as the final. We definitely believe that.’

While many English sides have looked upon the Europa League as a distraction from domestic matters in recent seasons, that hasn’t been the case at Everton. 

Martinez has purposely picked strong sides to keep his team’s run going, rather than sacrifice participation in the competition for the sake of concentrating more on the Premier League.

That has impacted on the club’s domestic performance and they lie 14th in the top flight - but hopes remain high they can strike a balance on both fronts.

Naismith added: ‘After working so hard last season and being so close to the top four in the league, this was our reward. I don’t think you can treat the Europa League as if it’s not worth going 100 per cent for - and the manager has shown that in his team selections.

‘Sometimes we have found it hard to deal with having games so close together and, with a few injuries, our squad has been a bit tight because of that. 

'We’ve not had many players we can rotate but full credit to the manager for keeping a strong stance in Europe. That’s why we have done so well in the competition and he will want to keep doing the same.’

Kiev aren’t the same force they’ve been in the past but Naismith still rates them and is wary of the damage they can cause on Merseyside this evening. He remains confident, however, that if Everton perform the way they can, they will keep up their challenge for silverware.

‘Dynamo are a very good team. We’ve watched them on video and we’ ll continue to do so right up to the game. They don’t get as much air time as many other sides and they’re not seen to be as glamorous but they are dangerous with very good players. 

'We will need to watch them and be at our best but we came through one of the toughest groups which included Lyon and Wolfsburg.

‘To have done that with the quality we have, I don’t think we will worry about any team. We believe in the way we play and if we are at our best, we can trouble anyone.’
