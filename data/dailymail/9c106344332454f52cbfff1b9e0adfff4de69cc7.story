It was a victory over the censors the irrepressible Michael Winner would savour for the rest of his life.

The director never tired of telling how he and 50 VIP supporters stopped the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) cutting a ‘sadistic’ scene of Faye Dunaway whipping a topless woman from his 1983 romp The Wicked Lady.

But now the author Fay Weldon, one of the figures who publicly backed Winner, has revealed that he duped her and her fellow celebrities into siding with him.

Controversial: Faye Dunaway starred in the 1983 film The Wicked Lady which features a topless woman being whipped

Ms Weldon, 81, claims Winner won the support of opinion-formers – including Lucky Jim author Kingsley Amis and John Mortimer, creator of Rumpole Of The Bailey – after showing them a doctored version of the scene.

She says: ‘Michael Winner sent me a video of the film prior to its release and I remember thinking it was on the verge of being exploitative but I didn’t think there was anything that should be cut.

‘Indeed, I told the BBFC I would be happy for my 12-year-old son to watch the film. But I saw the film again some years later and I realised Winner had taken us for a ride. We had been shown a cleaned-up version of the same scene.’

She adds: ‘I know some might think, “Well, that is just Michael Winner the lovable old rogue,” but I think it was a very regrettable thing to do. Regrettable but perhaps not surprising.’

Raunchy: BBFC made cuts to the video release of The Wicked Lady starring Faye Dunaway and John Gielgud

Ms Weldon saw the film a second time two years after its cinema release when she joined the BBFC’s Video Reviews Panel, which vetted films for release on video.

She informed the BBFC of the discrepancies and the officials ensured the cuts they had wanted for the film’s big-screen version were made for its video release.

Her comments shed new light on one of the most controversial censorship rows in cinema history.

Winner, who died last month, knew that a high-profile public dispute would boost the film’s chances of being a box-office success.

But James Ferman, the then Secretary of the BBFC, told him that without cuts, the film might not even get an 18 certificate – a rating that had recently been brought in to replace the old X category.

The board’s examiners thought the scene ‘thoroughly exploitative in a Winnerish way’ and that it introduced ‘an unnecessary degree of sadism’.

But in a letter to the BBFC dated March 9, 1983, Winner wrote: ‘Every person who was shown the film took the view that cuts should not be required for the X certificate category. Some even took the view that cuts should not be required even for the PG.’

However, other letters in the BBFC’s archives show that not everyone in the British film industry was impressed with Winner’s battle to beat the censor’s scissors.

Lord Puttnam declined to fight Winner’s corner as he objected to the violent treatment of women in films.

Winner himself made no reference to his VIP supporters being shown different versions of the film in his autobiography in 2004.

And Michael J. Kagan, an associate producer on The Wicked Lady, said he doubted Winner would have doctored the film for anyone.

A BBFC spokesman declined to comment.
