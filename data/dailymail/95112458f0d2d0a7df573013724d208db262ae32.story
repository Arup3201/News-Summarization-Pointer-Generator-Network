Mike Gapes, a Labour MP, was in Australia when he heard the news his daughter was dead

The teenage daughter of an MP was found dead in her university bedroom after suffering a heart attack aged just 19, an inquest heard.

Rebecca Gapes, the daughter of Essex MP Mike Gapes, was found by a builder at her student house in Canterbury, Kent, in May.

Canterbury Coroner’s Court heard she died from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome (SADS), a rare condition in which the heart mysteriously stops.

Her father, 60, an MP for the Labour Party, was in Australia when police woke him to tell him the tragic news.

He said shortly after hearing the news of her death that she was an 'articulate, intelligent and caring young woman' who was his 'best friend'.

Miss Gapes had felt unwell the day before she died and had decided not to go to lectures.

When Rebecca didn’t emerge from her room the following day friends asked a builder working on the house to force his way into her room where her body was found.

Her heartbroken father, who was in Australia with the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee at the time, had to be woken by police to receive the devastating news.

Recording a verdict of natural causes coroner Rebecca Cobb, said: 'The clinical cause of death is unascertained, but I do consider there is no indication of unnatural causes.

'I would place this in the category of natural causes from sudden adult death syndrome.'

Pathologist Dr Salim Anjarwalla told the hearing a post-mortem showed that while there was paracetamol in Rebecca’s system it was not very high.

He concluded Rebecca had almost certainly suffered a sudden cardiac death.

Dr Anjarwalla said: 'There are around 500 cases a year of sudden adult death syndrome.

Canterbury Christ Church University, Kent, where Rebecca was in her first year studying American studies

'The cause of death remains unascertained, but I favour sudden cardiac death.'

The bright student was in her first year of a course in American studies at Canterbury Christ Church University and sharing a house with five fellow female students.

She returned to the house on the night of May 8 and spoke to two of her housemates before going to bed.

The next day she told housemate and fellow American studies student Ceiridwen Fowles she felt ill.

Rebecca said she would not be going to lectures and would be missing a trip to the cinema later that day.

In a statement read out at the inquest, Miss Fowles said she had read messages from Rebecca on Twitter saying she had vomited twice and taken paracetamol.

At 9pm when Rebecca had still not emerged from her bedroom her housemates asked about her health, but Rebecca said she was well.

The next day on May 10 Rebecca missed her lectures and her there was no response from her room.

A builder working on the house forced his way in and found Rebecca was dead.

Her father has represented the Essex constituency of Ilford South since 1992.

Shortly after her death, her father paid a moving tribute to his daughter: 'This is so difficult for me. Rebecca was an articulate, intelligent and caring young woman.

'She was very happy at university and doing really well. Rebecca was not just my daughter, she was my best friend.

'I have dealt with people who have 
been bereaved, but until something awful like this happens to you, you 
can never understand how it feels.'

Mr Gapes was first elected as Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament for Ilford South in April 1992.
