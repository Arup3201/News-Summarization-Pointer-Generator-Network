A teenage girl pimp who used intimidation and bullying to get vulnerable young women to partake in sex with older men avoided prosecution because authorities felt it was not in the public interest.

The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was dubbed ‘The Honey Monster’ because of  the sick role she played in procuring girls for a gang of men in Rochdale between 2008 and 2009.

Young victims from ‘chaotic’ ‘council estate’ backgrounds were coerced by the teenager, who was 15 at the time, from popular ‘honeypot’ locations such as outside takeaway restaurants, Liverpool Crown Court heard.

Guilty: Kabeer Hassan 25 (left) who has been found guilty of conspiracy and rape and Mohammed Amin, 45, (right) who has been found guilty of conspiracy and sexual assault

Prosecuted: Hamid Safi, 22, left, who has been found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking but not guilty of two counts of rape and Adil Khan, 42, who has been found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation

Nine men were today found guilty of grooming and passing round vulnerable schoolgirls aged between the ages of 13 and 15 for sex after plying them with alcohol and drugs.

The jury was told the teenager used intimidation and bullying to coerce other teenagers to have sex with the men at ‘chill houses’ while she collected payment.

One victim told jurers that 'The Honey Monster' was the key player in the sex abuse. She said: 'She was intimidating, she was nasty, she was scary.

'If it was up to me she would be on trial getting worse than they are because she is the main one in this.

'I believe if it was not for her I would not have got into what was going on.'

However, despite victims blaming the teenager’s intimidating tactics for forcing them to have sex with the men the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute.

Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for the North West, said: 'A careful assessment of all the evidence demonstrated her involvement in the conspiracy with which the defendants were eventually charged.'

But he added: 'In considering whether or not to prosecute her, the CPS applied the code for crown prosecutors and determined that it was not in the public interest to do so.’

He said factors taken into consideration when making the decision included her age at the time of the offences (15-16), her own background and the circumstances in which she became involved in these events.

Offenders: Abdul Qayyum, 44, has been found guilty of conspiracy. Mohammed Sajid, 35, has been found guilty of conspiracy, trafficking, one count of rape and one count of sexual activity with a child

Facing jail: Taxi driver Abdul Aziz, 41 (left) has been found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation and Abdul Rauf, 43, of Rochdale, was found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation

The court heard how 'The Honey Monster' became the girlfriend of one of the gang and often plied the victims with alcohol, food and money.

It was told she sometimes had sex with one man while another raped a girl in the same room.

A witness who gave evidence at the trial about a conversation she had with 'The Honey Monster' said the teenager boasted about her role.

She told the court: ‘The Honey Monster started going on about how they had sex with Asian guys for money.

‘The Honey Monster was saying it like it was some big achievement.

The witness told the jury that the girl said she was 'not doing it herself. She was getting other people to do it for her'.

One of the men was said to be taxi driver Mohammed Amin, who was convicted of sexual assault. He was known to the girls by the nickname 'Car Zero'.

The witness said Car Zero was involved in the conversation. She added: 'He said she (The Honey Monster) is the hardest in Heywood. If you want to work for her you will be ok. She looks after us all.

'She was sat there, like, with this big smirk on her face like it was something to be proud of.'

The witness then went on to describe how the coercive teenager told another girl, who was 15, to have sex with a 'skinny Pakistani man'.

She said she 'could tell she didn't want to go'.

She said 'the girl eventually went and the witness described how after about 15 minutes she heard crying in the bedroom.

She said she went in and saw the girl sat on bed with no underwear on.She added: 'She was scared. She was crying quite a lot. He was walking out of the bedroom.

'I then remember the (Honeymonster) coming into the bedroom and she started laughing. And I said 'why are you laughing at that? That's disgusting.'
