These moving 
photographs show the moment dozens of people paid tribute to a Greek 
Cypriot who has finally been laid to rest after being killed during the 
Turkish invasion nearly 40 years ago.

Yiannakis
 Savva Liasis was killed during the 1974 invasion, aged 21, but listed 
as a missing person when his body was never found or recovered.

However,
 in 2010, his body was discovered in a mass grave in Klepini - a village
 in the Kyrenia District of Cyprus – and he was formally identified in 
May this year after a DNA test.

Today,
 family members, friends and government officials paid tribute to the 
former soldier at a ceremony in the village of Ayia Triada, Yialousa.

Family members, friends and government officials attended the funeral of Yiannakis Savva Liasis today to pay tribute to the Greek Cypriot soldier who was killed aged 21 in the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974

Bouquets of flowers were placed on the coffin of the 21-year-old, who was last seen alive by his parents on August 11, 1974, as he was buried

The ceremony means Mr Liasis has become the first Greek Cypriot missing person to be buried in the Turkish-occupied area in the north.

Bouquets
 of flowers were placed on the coffin of the 21-year-old, who was last 
seen alive by his parents on August 11, 1974, as he was buried.

As
 family members embraced each other, the head of the president’s office,
 Panayiotis Antoniou, led the tributes with a moving eulogy.

‘After
 an unacceptable delay of 40 years, we direct our final farewell to 
Yiannakis Liasis, a brilliant and virtuous young man with passion and 
dreams for himself, his family and his homeland,’ he said.

‘On
 behalf of President Nikos Anastasiades and his government, I extend my 
warmest condolences to Yiannakis Liasis’ parents, Savvas and Maroulla, 
as well as his sister Toula.’

Mr
 Liasis was deemed a missing person for almost 40 years after 
disappearing during the invasion, which is set to be remembered later 
this month as 40th anniversary commemorations take place across the 
country.

Speaking at Mr 
Liasis’ funeral today, Mr Antoniou said the government aimed to resolve 
other cases of missing people in similar circumstances.

According
 to the Cyprus Mail, he said: ‘The aim is to finally end this 
humanitarian problem that continues to hurt many people, Greek and 
Turkish Cypriots alike, especially relatives who demand and are entitled
 to answers with regard to the fate of their loved ones and have their 
funerals according to their religion and sacred traditions.’

Mr Liasis’ remains were discovered as part of ongoing investigations carried out by the Committee for Missing Persons (CMP).

The
 group has been working hard to help relatives of missing people recover
 the remains of their loved ones and arrange for a proper burial.

Since
 July 2007, the CMP has returned the first remains of Greek Cypriot and 
Turkish Cypriot individuals who went missing in the tragic events of 
1963-64 and 1974.

July 20 marks the 40th anniversary of the invasion, codenamed Operation Attila by Turks who opposed a union with Greece.

Only Turkey recognises the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state that was proclaimed in the north.

The July invasion resulted in some 37 per cent of the island being captured by Turkish forces before a ceasefire was announced.

UN
 peacekeepers have patrolled the area for years to try and prevent 
clashes between the populations of the two halves of the island.
