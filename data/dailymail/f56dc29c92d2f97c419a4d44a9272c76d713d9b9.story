Genetically modified crops 'have a role to play' in helping feed the world, the Princess Royal has said - putting her at stark odds with her older brother Prince Charles.

Her acceptance that the development of GM crops is 'inevitable' is staunchly opposite to the Prince of Wales who is on the anti-GM side of the debate.

The Queen's daughter admits she seldom discusses the issue with the Prince of Wales, who once 
suggested the method risked creating ‘the biggest disaster 
environmentally of all time’.

Princess Anne said new methods are needed to ensure the world's population is adequately fed, adding that those who are opposed to the idea have to accept GM crops will be cultivated.

Princess Anne told BBC's Countryfile that GM crops have a role to play in feeding the world, putting her at odds with her brother, the Prince of Wales who is anti-GM

In an interview for the BBC's Countryfile programme she said: ‘I think it (GM) has a role to play, to be honest.'

When asked what Prince Charles thought of her viewpoint, she said it is natural for families to adopt differing opinions.

She said: ‘I
 do think there are some things which, even if you don’t like the sound 
of it yourself, you know that it’s got to a point where you’re not going
 to stop it, because you can’t.’ 

Appearing on the BBC One show Princess Anne also advocated gassing badgers as a 'much nicer way' to control the Bovine TB outbreak, than shooting.

Princess
 Anne’s intervention came after Environment Secretary Owen Paterson 
refused to scrap the controversial pilot badger culls.

An
 independent report found that the ‘controlled shooting’ used so far has
 not been an efficient or humane way to reduce the number of badgers in 
the South West.

Princess Anne said ‘gas is a much nicer way of 
doing it, if that’s not a silly expression’.

The Princess Royal made the comments in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday on BBC1

In an 
extraordinary interview full of outspoken comments, Princess Anne also 
suggested that eating horsemeat is ‘worth looking at’.

She said she has tried eating it and found it tasted ‘very good’.

In
 a series of discussions on countryside matters, Anne backed the recent 
pilot badger culls, one of which was carried out in Gloucestershire 
where she lives and farms.

Her remarks were met with fury from animal rights campaigners, who argue that gassing - which was banned in 1982 - is inhumane.

An
 independent report published on Thursday found that the badger cull in 
Somerset and Gloucestershire had been marred by poor marksmanship.

Badgers had in some cases taken longer than five minutes to die and far too few animals were killed.

Controlled shooting - the shooting of free-running badgers - was not an efficient way of killing the animals, the report found.

Asked
 about alternatives to gunning them down, Anne said: ‘Most people will 
tell you that gas is a much nicer way of doing it, if that’s not a silly
 expression, because of the way it works.

‘And how it works is that you go to sleep, basically.’

The royal’s comments were condemned by animal campaigners and zoologists.

Professor
 Rosie Woodroffe, senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of 
London, said: ‘Gassing badgers was government policy in the 1970s, and 
reports of the time are full of frustration about how it just wasn’t 
very effective.

‘Sub-lethal concentrations of gas were inhumane. That’s why gassing was banned by ministers in 1982.

‘The
 problem seemed to be that badger setts are built to hold warm air in 
and keep cold drafts out - so it was very difficult to achieve lethal 
concentrations of gas.’

Princess Anne's comments about gassing badgers came after Environment Secretary Owen Paterson refused to scrap the controversial pilot badger culls

She added: ‘Culling works against the grain of badger ecology and behaviour.

‘It’s
 much more promising to explore the possibilities for vaccination, which
 could potentially exploit the same aspects of badger biology to improve
 the effectiveness of TB control.’

Mark
 Jones, of Humane Society International, said: ‘It is extremely 
disappointing that a prominent member of the royal family should endorse
 the gassing of a supposedly protected indigenous wild mammal.

‘Gassing
 experiments carried out at Porton Down in the early 1980s were 
abandoned because of the appalling levels of suffering to which the 
badgers were exposed.

‘Any
 attempt to reintroduce gassing would doubtless result in a slow and 
painful death for many badgers, and potentially other non-target 
animals.’

Princess Anne
 has farmed at her Gatcombe estate for nearly four decades, and bovine 
TB has wiped out a third of one herd in the past two years.

But
 she added that the feared spread of TB to cattle was not the only 
reason to cull badgers, which she said were getting out of control in 
some areas, causing problems for other species such as hedgehogs, bees 
and ground-nesting birds.

The
 Queen’s daughter said: ‘Even if you took the cattle completely out of 
this debate, from a conservation issue alone, you’d have to say there 
are too many badgers.

‘A bigger growth in the badger population is not good for the balance of conservation anyway.’

Caroline
 Allen, a working vet and member of the Green Party, said: ‘Research 
clearly shows that gassing badgers is even more inhumane than shooting 
and the Independent Panel Reports has shown that was bad enough.

‘Defra
 has clearly stated that gassing with cyanide should never again be 
considered and there are no alternate gases available without similar 
unacceptable effects.’

CONTROLLED SHOOTINGDuring pilot culls last year marksmen shot at freely running badgers, aiming to cut numbers by 70 per cent. Only 48 per cent were killed in Somerset and 39 per cent in Gloucestershire. Up to 23 per cent took more than five minutes to die.

TRAPPED SHOOTING Alternative is to use bait to lure badgers into small cages before killing them with a shotgun. Pilot culls were only meant to use traps as a last resort, but an independent review found contractors started using the method after just two days.

GASSINGExperiments in the 1970s and 1980s found too many badgers were injured but not killed by cyanide gas, which critics said was cruel and painful.

VACCINATIONSAnimal rights campaigners argue a vaccination programme would be far more humane and effective. A scheme for a ‘buffer zone’ around the worst-affected areas was announced on Thursday, but ministers say it is too late to vaccinate in high-risk areas.
