Britain is set to feel the chill again as a cold air mass from Russia brings temperatures as low as 1C this weekend with snow expected in some parts of the UK.

After the country basked in 17.5C heat last week with thousands of people flocking to parks and beaches, the start of spring is to be pushed back by a 'raw' polar blast from the east.

The Met Office blames the low temperatures on high pressure building in the North-east and say the Midlands and the North of the country could see a dusting of snow on the hills.

The forecast comes as high altitude areas in the UK, including Durham and Huddersfield, were blanketed with snow today after an overnight fall. 

Met Office forecaster Laura Young said it is going to be a largely cloudy and grey weekend but where rain meets cold air, further parts of the UK could see snow.

She said: 'There was snow in the hills in South Wales today which fell overnight as rain moved westward and reached high altitudes.

'This weekend will see low temperatures of around 6C in the day, which is a few degrees lower than the country's March average of 9.8C.

'Nighttime temperatures will fall to 1 to 3C in the North and 2 to 5C in the South and the cloudy weather will actually prevent it from getting any colder.

'The cold air will be felt more where there is rain and we could see some wintry content in places like the Peak District and Yorkshire.

'On Monday and Tuesday it will get back to average with 9 or 10C expected - but it will stay cloudy.'   

The forecast will come as a disappointment after spring appeared to have arrived at the beginning of the month.

Last week the mercury hit 17.5C on the hottest day of the year and some parts of the UK were warmer than Mediterranean hot-spots such as Rome and Athens.

Thousands of sun-seekers were pictured flocking to Brighton Beach and London's Hyde Park to welcome what they thought was the start of a new season.

John Griffiths, a forecaster at MeteoGroup, also predicted a fairly miserable outlook for the next week with cloud and light rain predicted for most days.

He said: 'The next few days will be rather cloudy for most areas will a few sunny spells in northwest Scotland. Tomorrow will have temperature highs of around 7 to 8C which is a big drop from what we've had.

'There is a wind from the Northeast but it is fairly light. Overnight temperatures in the South will be around 0C with parts of Scotland below freezing.

'Monday will be slightly warmer with around 11C expected in London and Tuesday will be even warmer across England and Wales. But generally it will stay cloudy with bits of drizzle for the next week.'
