One of the biggest matches of his Liverpool career awaits but Raheem Sterling looked in the mood ahead of the Tuesday night's crunch match against Basle.

The 20-year-old gave a thumbs up as he and his team-mates were snapped arriving at Anfield almost eight hours before their Champions League do-or-die match kicks off.

Sterling, Adam Lallana, Jordan Henderson and Co were carrying bags and suits ahead of the must-win tie with a place in the last 16 of Europe's elite competition up for grabs.

Last year's Barclays Premier League runners up will need to be on guard, however, with Breel Embolo among those that could cause them trouble in the Basle team.

The 17-year-old is being watched by Manchester United, City, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid, has more than 20 scouts coming to Anfield to watch him, and had to take time off school to be with the Swiss side.

That may be among the reasons Brendan Rodgers has called for cool heads as he reminded his Liverpool team they are not racing against time in this collision with Basle.

'I looked at Ludogorets and this game as being key when the draw was made,' Rodgers said at a press conference on Monday. 'It is up to us to get the job complete.

'This is a competition that has a great history. That Olympiacos game [in 2004] was a part of the great history. It’s now up to them to write themselves into folklore. We can’t be relying solely on Steven [Gerrard].

'It is up to other players to be the catalyst. When you are world class, the weight falls on your shoulders but for us to get the result we need, we need the team to be functioning at a good level.

'We are only focusing on the positive. If we get through we can put it to bed and that will give us confidence. I think we are slowly coming back together after a slow period. I have seen signs in recent games of it coming together again.

'We know it is going to be a tough game but we have seen how the crowd can get behind you. If we get through, we can put it behind us and we will have confidence for the rest of our games.'
