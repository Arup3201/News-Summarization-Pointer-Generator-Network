Emergency crews were called to the school at 5am after an alarm was activated.

Superintendent Tom Cooper from Fire and Rescue NSW said it was hard to locate the fire because the school is isolated and surrounded by lots of bushland, the ABC reported.  

When they arrived, they found a number of classrooms well alight towards the back of the school.

Superintendent  Cooper said flames completely 'engulfed' the school.

'Flames were leaping into the air, they had a building that was about 80 metres by 40 metres and three quarters of it was in flames,' Superintendent Cooper told Sydney Morning Herald.  

Twelve firefighting crews from NSW Fire and Rescue and the Rural Fire Service surrounded the building of five interlinked classrooms, believed to be used for industrial arts, woodworking and metalworking classes.

While four were completely destroyed, extensive damage has been caused to the fifth classroom. 

Firefighters managed to control the blaze by 8am on Sunday.

Last year's bushfires in the Blue Mountains saw the school lose Elmhurst house, a historic building built in 1987. Students sitting a HSC exam were forced to evacuate because of the September fires in 2013.  

No one has been injured during Sunday's fire. 

Police are urging witnesses to come forward.
