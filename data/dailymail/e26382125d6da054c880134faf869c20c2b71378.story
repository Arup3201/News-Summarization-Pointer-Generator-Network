Construction workers  have been forced to build a £10 million road project around two apartment blocks in China after several families refused to move.

The embarrassing rebuke by the ten households has forced developers to curve the major new route around the properties in the city of Yongjia, in eastern China's Zhejiang province, The People's Daily reports.

Officials launched the multi-million pound blueprint to much fanfare, saying the new 10-mile provincial road would provide a fast and efficient route between the city and 19 surrounding villages.

But although work started in December 2011, construction was forced to stop when 10 families refused to accept the compensation offered to allow their properties to be demolished.

This year local council officials lost their patience and ordered the road builders to go around the properties.

The four-lane highway opened last month with many drivers arguing the bizarre layout is dangerous.

In China, it is common practice to ask people to move out of their homes to make way for important public sector developments.

People who refuse are known as 'nail homeowners' - a term which comes from the nuisance a nail causes when stuck in a fence post. 

The homeowners say they are happy to move but only if they are offered a fair price so they can afford a new property and be compensated for the inconvenience of leaving homes where they were perfectly happy.

Jun Lo, 40, who lives in one of the properties with his wife and parents said they would not be bullied into leaving.

He said: 'They tried all sorts of mean tricks to get other people to move out, but me and the others won't budge now because we don't want to be bullied. 

'If they want us to go, then they need to pay a decent price otherwise we are just going to sit here.'
