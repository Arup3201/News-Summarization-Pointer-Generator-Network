Spending spree: Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has announced today that he is investing $300 million into social networking site Twitter

He is the billionaire Saudi prince who already boasts a business portfolio that includes shares in Apple, AOL, News Corp and Fox News.

Now Alwaleed bin Talal has announced he will be widening his media influence by investing $300 million into Twitter.

His joint investment with his Kingdom Holding Company (KHC) follows months of negotiations which they say will give them a 'strategic stake' in the micro-blogging site.

It is not yet clear how much of the company the prince will control.

His investment comes as Arab 
activists from Tunisia to Bahrain have flocked to Twitter during the past year to coordinate 
protests and voice their opposition to long-ruling autocratic regimes.

The five-year-old site has been 
instrumental in connecting protesters and relaying on-the-ground 
developments during the Arab Spring uprisings.

But a Saudi law which came into force in February has given the state further powers to fine or block online news and commentary websites if they are deemed to be offensive, compromising the nationâ€™s economy or security, or violating Islamic sharia law.

Two years ago, lawyer Waleed Abulkhair and businessman Khaled al Nasser said their Twitter accounts had been blocked because of their comments on human rights in the kingdom. Some activists have eve been detained.

Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the Saudi king, ranks 26th on Forbes' list of the world's richest people.

He has a history of investing in media and technology companies, and said the deal represents an interest 'in promising, high-growth businesses with a global impact.'

'We believe that social media will 
fundamentally change the media industry landscape in the coming years,' 
Ahmed Halawani, KHC's executive director of private equity and 
international investments, said in a statement.

'Twitter will capture and monetize this positive trend.'

Twitter spokesman Matt Graves confirmed the investment but was unable to provide further details.

Prince Alwaleed owns 95 per cent of KHC, which has a major stakes in Citigroup, Apple, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

Arabic
is now the fastest growing language on Twitter, according to a study 
released last month by French social media research firm Semiocast.

Although
Arabic tweets account for just over 1 per cent of all Twitter messages,
their volume has jumped 22 times over the past year, Semiocast said.

'Twitter
is growing exponentially, especially in the context of the Middle 
East,' said Ismail Patel, who follows digital media in the region for 
the research firm Informa Telecoms & Media.

'The Middle East is an important region 
for Twitter. And Twitter is becoming increasingly important for all 
Middle East residents ... because of the Arab Spring protests.

Prince Alwaleed is launching a new 
Arabic news channel that will challenge established players such as 
Qatar's Al-Jazeera and Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya.

The
channel, which will be called Alarab, is expected to begin operations 
next year and will feature reports from business news service Bloomberg 
LP.

Prince Alwaleed 
has said he hopes the new network will focus on the shifts taking place 
across the Arab world, with an emphasis on increased freedom of speech 
and of the press.

KHC 
also owns a sizable stake in a Saudi media company that produces the 
influential Arabic language newspaper Asharq al-Awsat and other 
publications.

Prince Alwaleed's decision to buy into Twitter likely goes beyond his interest in media and technology.

Said
Hirsh, a Mideast economist with Capital Economics in London, said rich 
Arab investors like Prince Alwaleed have long targeted trophy assets and
well established businesses.

'It
is an investment into a well recognized brand with future growth 
potential,' Mr Hirsh said, adding that Twitter investors such as 
Alwaleed are unlikely to try to influence the user-generated content on 
the site.

In charge: Dick Costolo, the chief executive officer of Twitter

'I don't think that there is anything sinister behind it,' he said.

Twitter recently began rolling out a series of tweaks designed to make the site easier to navigate.

The redesign also aims to allow for more detailed information about corporate brands, as Twitter tries to convert more companies into advertisers.

The company earlier this year raised $400 million from venture capitalists and other investors.

Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said in September that cash cushion would allow the company to control its own destiny - and for now avoid selling its stock through an initial public offering.

By limiting its shareholders to a small group of private investors, Twitter doesn't have to disclose how much revenue it brings in.

The research firm eMarketer estimates Twitter will generate close to $140 million in ad revenue this year and $260 million in 2012.

Globally, the San Francisco-based 
company has more than 100 million active users who post an average of 
250 million messages, or 'tweets,' a day.

Twitter allows users to send short messages of up to 140 characters.
