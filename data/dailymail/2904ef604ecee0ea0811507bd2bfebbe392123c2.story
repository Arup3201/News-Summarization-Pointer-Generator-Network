An Arizona travel magazine told readers to eat psychedelic mushrooms.

Not so fast: Despite being labeled as 'edible' by Arizona Highways magazine, readers are advised against eating the mushroom 'because of its unpredictable psychotropic and physical effects'

The October issue of Arizona Highways shows a picture of a hallucinogenic mushroom identified as edible. Realizing their gaffe, the magazine’s publishers pulled all issues from shelves and notified subscribers.

The magazine’s ‘nature factoid’ of the month showed the fly agaric mushroom on page 13 of this month’s issue.

The error was announced Friday on the magazine’s  .

‘The fly agaric mushroom should not be consumed in its raw form because of its unpredictable psychotropic and physical effects,’ the statement read.

The issue will not be sold on newsstands and subscribers will be alerted, said publisher Win Holden.

‘We regret the error,’ he added.
