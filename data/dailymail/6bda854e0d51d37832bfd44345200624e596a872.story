The 20-year-old boyfriend of a troubled schoolgirl who took her own life was later arrested on suspicion of child sex offences, it emerged today.

An inquest yesterday heard how Marcus Webb discovered the body of his girlfriend Ashli Blake, 15, in September at the foot of a historic monument near Rockbourne, Hampshire.

Prior to her death Ashli, who had a history of mental health problems, had sent him a text message threatening to 'jump off the tower', the inquest heard.

Today Hampshire Police confirmed a 20-year-old man, confirmed as Mr Webb by his father, was arrested on November 25 on suspicion of child sex offences.

He has not been charged with an offence and was bailed until February 6 while investigations continue.

A spokesman for Hampshire Constabulary said: 'A 20-year-old man from the Fordingbridge area has been arrested on suspicion of engaging in sexual activity with a child and possessing indecent images in an investigation related to this death.

'He has been bailed until February pending further enquiries.'

Police declined to comment further.

Mr Webb's father Mervyn, 54, said police quizzed his son last week and he collected him from the station later in the day.

He said: 'The police picked him up and he got taken in for questioning by officers. I had to go and collect him from Winchester.

'I spoke with his mother today and she told me Marcus is still more than upset about it all.'

Winchester Coroner's Court yesterday heard how Ashli, who was born with the surname Cook, was found dead by her boyfriend in the early hours of September 21.

She sent a text to him which read: 'I am going to jump off the tower.'

Mr Webb told the inquest he had not believed her threats at first, because she had made similar comments previously.

But he launched a desperate search when he and her family failed to get hold of her on the day of her death.

Mr Webb said he had visited the monument several times with Ashli.

In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Webb said: 'I feel so guilty and I feel like it was my fault, she told me she was going to kill herself and even told me where she was going to do it and I laughed at her because I didn't believe her.

'Ashli meant more than life itself to me, I would do nothing to hurt her, I now feel there's no reason being here.'

Ashli's mother, Canasta Blake, 37, told the inquest in a statement: 'They had made plans for the rest of their lives together - at 16 she was going to move in with him.

'She was besotted with him. She was always worried about him and what he was doing.

'I do not understand why she did this, she had everything to live for and often spoke of the future.

'I think, for her age, she was immature, in her laughing, giggling and making up silly words. Ashli was a lovely young girl, was imaginative, different and quirky, she had her own special dress sense.

'She would have grown up to be a lovely person.'

Ms Blake added that Ashli was working hard at her studies and had told family members she wanted to become an art therapist or an accountant. 

The coroner was told Ashli had suffered 'some bullying problems' at Burgate School in her home town of Fordingbridge.

And Ashli's GP, Dr Charlotte Hillsley, at Fordingbridge Surgery, said she had suffered from low moods and sleeping problems.

She had previously been referred to the Hampshire Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services but had been discharged.

However, in July she had returned to the surgery and was referred again to the clinic and was placed on its waiting list.

In a statement read to the inquest, Dr Hillsley said: 'Ashli had low mood and poor sleep and was struggling with bullying at school.

'Her mother had told me she had removed razor blades from the house and taken them to work with her because she was concerned that she may self-harm.' 

Pathologist Dr Eleanor Jaynes told the inquest the schoolgirl had taken no alcohol or drugs prior to her death and had died of multiple traumatic injuries due to a fall from a height.

Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame Short recorded a verdict that she had intended to take her own life.

Ashli Blake, 15, was  found dead in a field next to a historic monument in Hampshire on September 21

He said: 'Ashli was a deeply troubled girl but I find that she chose to end her life on this occasion.

'It's clear that she had a boyfriend, Marcus Webb, and I find that she was very much in love with him to a degree that only a teenager can be.'

In the wake of her death, staff at The Burgate School said they were 'shocked and saddened' to hear of the tragedy.

A school spokesman said: 'We are shocked and saddened to hear the tragic news that one of our Year 11 students has died.

'Ashli was an absolutely delightful, caring and mature young lady.

'She was working hard at school and was very well regarded and respected by staff and students alike.

'The school is pulling together as a community and supporting each other.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to Ashli's family at this most difficult time.'
