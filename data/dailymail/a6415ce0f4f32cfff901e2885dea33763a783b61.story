Russia's foreign minister has demanded more autonomy for Ukraine’s regions as his country's military builds up on its neighbour's territory.

Sergei Lavrov met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Andriy Deshchytsia, yesterday, making the demands while an under pressure Ukraine ordered its troops out from Crimea after the Russian seizure of military bases there.

The demand came before NATO today expressed concern over the Russian military build-up on Ukraine’s borders. Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said NATO has all plans in place to defend members of the alliance.

Mr Lavrov unexpectedly agreed to the 
highest level meeting yet between the Russian government and a 
representative of the new Ukrainian government that Moscow has opposed 
vociferously over the past month.

The meeting took place on the sidelines of a nuclear security summit in the Hague, Netherlands.

Mr
 Lavrov told Mr Deshchytsia that Russia continues to want constitutional
 changes in Ukraine that would give more autonomy to all regions of 
Ukraine.

Meanwhile, 
NATO’s Mr Rasmussen said: ‘We are very much concerned about the Russian 
military build-up along the borders of Ukraine.

‘All NATO allies can be assured of our determination to provide effective defence... We have all plans in place to provide effective defence of our allies,’ he said, adding that the Western military alliance was discussing with Kiev how it could enhance its support for non-NATO member Ukraine.

Russia is eager to retain its influence in Ukraine's Russian-speaking eastern regions and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. It has pushed for the new Ukraine to become a loose federation - demands the new Ukrainian government has rejected.

Before the meeting, Mr Deshchytsia said his government fears a Russian military build-up near Ukraine's border. ‘The possibility of a military invasion is very high. We are very much worried about this concentration of troops on our eastern border,’ he said.

The concerns have deepened under the intense military pressure Russia has applied in Crimea since Russian President Vladimir Putin formally annexed the peninsula last week. Russian forces have commandeered ships and broken into walled military installations with armored personnel carriers.

In the bay of Donuzlav in western Crimea, dozens of Ukrainian sailors marooned on the Konstantin Olshanskiy navy landing vessel abandoned ship Monday after weeks of tension and uncertainty. The Olshanskiy and two other warships have been trapped in the bay since Russian forces scuttled mothballed ships at the bay's inlet.

The sailors, using a small rubber boat that needed several trips to ferry them to land, were greeted by hecklers on the shore.

One man shouted they were deserting ‘rats', while another man blasted the Russian national anthem from his car.

‘We aren't rats, we aren't running,’ said one sailor, who only gave his first name of Yevgeny to discuss a sensitive subject. ‘Why should we have stayed, what would we have accomplished?’

Twenty of the estimated 60 sailors originally on board remained on the ship, which was later in the day stormed by armed men, presumed to be Russian forces.

Defence Ministry spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said the crew, which barricaded itself in the bulkhead, heard stun grenades and rifle fire. 

At a naval base near the eastern Crimean
 port of Feodosia, two injured servicemen were taken captive earlier in 
the day and as many as 80 were detained at the site, Ukrainian officials
 said.

With the storming of at least three 
military facilities in Crimea over the past three days - and the 
decision by some Ukrainian troops to stay employed by switching to the 
Russian side - it wasn't clear how many Ukrainian troops remained on the
 peninsula.

The former
 chief of Ukraine's navy, who was charged with treason after he swore 
allegiance to Crimea's pro-Russian authorities and urged others to 
defect, was named a deputy chief of Russia's Black Sea Fleet.

Ukraine's
 acting president, Oleksandr Turchnynov, whose new government in Kiev 
has struggled to maintain control and cohesion, signed a decree Monday 
ordering the withdrawal of all servicemen in Crimea to Ukraine's mainland.

Meanwhile, in Kiev, Mikhail Koval was today named defence minister of Ukraine following a parliamentary session.

He replaces Ihor Tenyukh, who was sacked by parliament on Tuesday over his handling of the crisis, after it emerged that less than a quarter of soldiers in Crimea plan to stay in the military.

Mr Tenyukh, appointed a month ago under an interim government that took power after the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovich, offered his resignation in a speech to parliament following criticism of the way Ukraine pulled its military out of Crimea.

Lawmakers initially rejected the offer but, after consultations between party faction leaders and parliament speaker and acting Ukrainian president Oleksander Turchinov, voted to remove him.

Elsewhere, ultra-nationalist leader Oleksandr Muzychko has been shot dead by police.

In an apparent effort to consolidate control from Kiev, Ukrainian police forces trying to detain the key in recent anti-government demonstrations killed him after he opened fire, the Interior Ministry said.

Right Sector's Oleksandr Muzychko, balso known as Sashko Bily, had become a recurring figure in Russian attempts to portray Ukraine's interim government as dominated by radical nationalists.

Moscow has cited the purported influence of groups like Right Sector to justify the absorption of Crimea.

Many in Ukraine downplay Right Sector's importance.

Police say Mr Muzychko was sought for organised crime links, hooliganism and for threatening public officials.
