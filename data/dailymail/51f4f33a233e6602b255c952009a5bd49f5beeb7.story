Nicky Butt has backed Ander Herrera to become a success at Manchester United but admits the Spanish midfielder is not yet at the same level as the likes of Toni Kroos or Paul Pogba.

The 24-year-old became new manager Louis van Gaal's first signing after joining from Athletic Bilbao for £28.4million.

But according to Butt, Herrera is not yet as good as Kroos, who on Thursday moved from Bayern Munich to Real Madrid, or former Old Trafford youth team graduate Pogba, who has been quoted at £60m to leave Juventus.

Butt, now on the coaching staff at Old Trafford, admits that Herrera needs time to reach the same standard as that duo.

'He [Herrera] was at the level where you
 just had to take note of this player because there are not many top 
midfielders you can get,' Butt told the Manchester Evening News about the player he spent time scouting last season.

'You
 can all talk about Pogba or Kroos but these kind of players are not 
easy to get. So you have to widen your net and Herrera is a bonus.

'He is
 at a level where he can play at a club like United and given a bit of 
time he can excel.

I 
watched Ander a few times last season on scouting trips. He impressed 
me. He can become a star player for us. He can become a big influence on
 our midfield [but] you will have to be patient with him.'

Kroos
 was mooted as a potential target during David Moyes ill-fated reign 
before it became clear he was moving to the Bernebeu - while United will
 rue letting Pogba leave the club in search of first-team football.
