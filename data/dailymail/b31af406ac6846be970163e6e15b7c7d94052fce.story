Little ground breaker: Heath Kidd is the first baby to be born using a new IVF treatment

He's only seven weeks old, but little Heath Kidd is already a pioneer.

His birth – the result of a groundbreaking technique dubbed ‘the natural IVF’ – could offer hope to thousands of women who are currently unable to have children.

While conventional IVF involves the mother being injected with artificial hormones, baby Heath was conceived with a new method that uses a naturally occurring hormone, kisspeptin.

This helps produce eggs in a safer way for the mother and avoids some of the risks associated with traditional IVF.

Heath’s mother Suzannah said she was thrilled with her ‘groundbreaker’ baby, who was born in April weighing 7.5lb after a ‘normal, healthy pregnancy’.

And while Mrs Kidd is the first to give birth, ten more women are expecting babies following the breakthrough study at Hammersmith Hospital’s IVF unit in West London, conducted with Imperial College, London.

Experts hope the treatment could be widely available in as little as two years.

‘We are over-the-moon to have Heath,’ Mrs Kidd said. ‘We feel so lucky to have him.

'It shows it does work and to know that we have helped move IVF treatment on is great.’

Mrs Kidd, 34, had tried for years to get pregnant after marrying husband Calum, 31, a project manager for a construction firm in 2008, but with no success.

After being diagnosed with ‘unexplained’ fertility problems and referred for conventional IVF on the NHS at Hammersmith Hospital, Mrs Kidd, who works as a credit manager, became pregnant with son Lochlann, now two, in March 2011.

Although they longed for another baby they were not entitled to any further rounds of IVF on the NHS.

New technique: Compared to traditional IVF treatment, where artificial hormones are used, which the Kidds underwent with two year old Lochlann, Heath was conceived using natural hormones

The pair were attempting to save the £6,000 required to pay for the treatment privately when Mrs Kidd spotted a poster advertising the new kisspeptin IVF trial at Hammersmith Hospital and phoned straight away to see if she was eligible.

Conventional IVF uses injections of high levels of ovary-stimulating drugs to mature eggs faster for collection.

But there are well-recognised risks to the mother if the ovaries are over-stimulated, known as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

This can endanger her life by leaking excess fluid into other parts of the body, leading to blood clots. The risks are particularly serious for women with polycystic ovaries.

Kisspeptin is a naturally occurring hormone that researchers suspected could be successfully used as a safer way to induce a woman’s eggs to mature and become ripe for fertilisation.

In normal pregnancies the body produces a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), which supports egg maturation and triggers ovulation. In traditional IVF an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) mimics this.

However, it can overstimulate the ovaries in women at high risk, especially those with polycystic ovaries.

The Kisspeptin, which has been produced in a synthetic form by the researchers, acts on the pituitary gland and sets off this LH surge.

She began to receive the trial treatment in July last year.

'I didn’t notice any difference at all from when I had the conventional IVF with Lochlann,’ she said.

A fertilised embryo was implanted within days of the final injection and Mrs Kidd discovered she was pregnant just three weeks later.

The study looked at the effectiveness of using kisspeptin to induce egg development in place of conventional hormone injections.

In regular IVF, the hormone injections that are used for egg development can trigger a serious condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).

This results in over-stimulation of the ovaries – causing too many eggs to be released. In some rare cases, this condition can even lead to death.

Those most at risk are women who cannot have children because they have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

As many as one in 12 women has PCOS, in which the polycystic ovary has tiny cysts around the outside, thought to be follicles that have failed to develop properly to release an egg.

For those women, this safer treatment is a major breakthrough.

Professor Waljit Dhillo, of Imperial College, said: ‘The results of the study are very encouraging and whilst we are primarily looking at women most at risk of developing OHSS, there is the potential kisspeptin could be used across all IVF treatments  as a more natural alternative.’
