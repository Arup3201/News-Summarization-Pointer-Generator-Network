Tony Blair could get a funeral on the scale of that of Margaret Thatcher, the minister in charge of planning her ceremonial send-off has suggested.

Despite claims that Britain is unlikely to see another political funeral on the scale of Baroness Thatcher’s, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said he would have no objection to a similar service when Mr Blair passes away.

Whitehall sources dismissed claims that it had already been decided that future prime ministers would not be afforded ceremonial services of the type watched by tens of thousands in London on Wednesday.

Mr Maude, asked about plans for Mr Blair’s demise, and whether he envisaged a similar funeral to that of Lady Thatcher, told BBC Radio 5’s Pienaar’s Politics: ‘I don’t think it’s for me to say actually. I certainly wouldn’t object to that at all.

‘I think that’s very much to be decided between the government of the day and the family. I think the wishes of the family should be paramount and the wishes of the person themselves.’

A Whitehall source said there had been no detailed discussion about funeral services for any of the surviving former prime ministers - Mr Blair, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown.

At only 70, John Major is now the oldest living former prime minister - the lowest age for the holder of that position at any time since World War Two.

But the source added: ‘Francis Maude has made it clear he would not object to a similar scale of funeral for Tony Blair, who like Margaret Thatcher did win three general elections.

No decision: A Whitehall source said there had been no detailed discussion about funeral services for any of the surviving former prime ministers - Mr Blair, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown.

‘Whether you like him or not, that is quite a big deal. Given the relative youth of our former prime ministers there has not been any detailed planning for this.

'Margaret Thatcher left very detailed instructions and most former prime ministers will have a clear idea of what they want.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg defended the use of taxpayers’ money for Lady Thatcher’s funeral, dismissing the objections of some Labour MPs by pointing out plans had been agreed under the governments of Mr Blair and Mr Brown.

‘There’s nothing new about the government of the day supporting funeral costs for significant public figures and, of course, former prime ministers - that is actually quite an established convention and has happened before,’ he told LBC radio.

‘These plans were not suddenly invented out of thin air, these were worked on over a long period of time, were pretty well established in detail by the previous government, not this coalition Government, and of course with the full consent, co-operation and support of the family.

‘Of course, I can hear that there are people who have differing views but whether you are for or against Margaret Thatcher, everybody recognises she was a very significant political figure and this was a big occasion and that it was done on a cross-party basis.’

Mr Maude said the bill will be ‘much, much less’ than the widely-reported figure of £10 million, but no official estimate of the cost has yet been released.

The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘We will publish the costs in due course. I think people will understand it can take a little time to draw together the final costings for high-profile and significant events such as yesterday’s funeral.

‘That is what is being done, and we will publish the costs.’

Asked whether the figure would include the full cost of the thousands of police and military personnel who were present at yesterday’s event, the spokesman said: ‘It will take account of the fact that a significant proportion of the personnel involved in the funeral ceremony would already have been on working duty.’

Sir Mark Thatcher said yesterday that his mother would have been ‘profoundly moved and gratified’ by Wednesday’s ceremonial funeral, which was effectively elevated to a state occasion by the presence of the Queen.
