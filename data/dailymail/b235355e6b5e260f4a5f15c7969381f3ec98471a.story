This parking warden looks like he might have just got himself crossed off the Christmas wish list and firmly embossed on the naughty list as he slapped Father Christmas with a fine.

The attendant was caught booking Santa as he ran over time at a metre in downtown LA.

But it looks like the reindeers were given the night off while Santa Claus headed to town,  as instead of a laden sleigh, he opted to run last minute errands in a sedan.

The man in red tried desperately to bargain with the warden, but to no avail

The famous Father Christmas charm seemed to fall on deaf ears, and the parking warden slapped him with a fine. Looks like someone might be getting a lump of coal in their stocking this year....

Onlookers said the parking warden moved 'quick as a flash' towards the car as the man in the red suit tried to reason with him.

But his famous festive charm seemed to fall flat on the die -hard Grinch traffic warden, and Santa was sent away with his tail between his legs.

He is not the first 'Bad Santa' of the season. 

In Oxfordshire, a Santa Claus was sacked from a garden centre grotto after he allegedly told children, 'I'm not real, it's your mum and dad'.

The Father Christmas also told the three siblings about the US school massacre - before they burst into tears.

Their mother, Wendy Kennett, said what was supposed to be a fun festive day out turned into the 'worst day of her life' as her children lost their faith in Santa.
