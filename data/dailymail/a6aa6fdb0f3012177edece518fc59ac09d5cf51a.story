In the wake of Brian Williams' decision to temporarily step away from the NBC Nightly News, fresh footage has emerged of him lying yet again about the 2003 Iraq war story that has got him into so much hot water.

The latest footage to surface is a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television in which Williams repeats his claim that a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at his helicopter.

The news anchor admitted on Wednesday that the story is totally false, but in the interview with a student journalist he even goes further and claims that he was close enough to stare down the barrel of the weapon. 

In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams claims that he was close enough to stare down the barrel of an RPG that had been fired at his helicopter in Iraq in 2003

'I looked down the tube of an RPG that had been fired at us and had hit the chopper in front of ours. And I'm so fortunate to be sitting here,' Williams told his young interviewer prior to a speaking engagement at the campus.

During the same interview Williams also recalls a close call in Israel in 2006 when he also claims he was lucky to escape rocket fire, reports Mediaite.

'I've been very lucky to have survived a few things that I've been involved in,' said Williams in 2007.

'The war with Hezbollah in Israel a few years back where there were Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in.'

Yet Williams' original report on the July 2006 incident tells a rather less dramatic version of events.

It does not reference anything close to rockets passing 'just beneath' his chopper and nor does he make any claims about being lucky to be alive.

'The trails of smoke and dust visible out the window are where Katyusha rockets have landed - in this case in the uninhabited Israeli countryside, and in some cases they have set fire to the surrounding brush. The missiles are unguided and random. And plentiful,' writes Williams.

'Then, I noticed something out the window. From a distance of six miles, I witnessed a rocket launch. A rising trail of smoke, then a second rocket launch, an orange flash and more smoke — as a rocket heads off toward Israel.'

But, in the 2007 interview, he told the student: 'I've been very, very lucky the way my life has turned out.'

NBC News President Deborah Turness announced on Friday that an internal investigation had been launched after questions arose over Williams' false on-air statements that he was in a helicopter hit by a rocket-propelled grenade while in Iraq in 2003. 

Then in a memo on Saturday to NBC News staff, that was released by the network, the anchorman said that as managing editor of NBC Nightly News it had become 'painfully apparent' that he has become a distracting news story.

Williams announced that was taking himself off the broadcast for several days with weekend anchor Lester Holt set to fill in.

In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions.'

As Managing Editor of NBC Nightly News, I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days, and Lester Holt has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue. 

Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us.

A source told the DailyMail.com Williams will not be involved in any of the day-to-day editing of the program during his absence.

It has been repeatedly reported that NBC executives were warned a year ago about Williams constantly inflating his biography.

The New York Times reports that it had got to the point where it was a joke in the news division but 'there was no one around to pull his chain when he got too over-the-top'.

NBC News refused to comment Saturday on when or whether Williams would return and who would decide his future. Williams, however, said he would be back.

'In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions,' Williams said in his memo.

'Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us,' he wrote.

There was no indication by Williams, who has anchored NBC Nightly News since 2004, that an absence was forthcoming during his newscast on Friday. He signed off as he usually does, saying he hoped people would be back to see him on Monday.

Holt did mention Williams' leave in Saturday's newscast.

'A word tonight about our colleague Brian Williams, who you may know has been under scrutiny this past week over his recollection of certain stories he's covered,' Holt said before reading Williams' memo to viewers.

Since Williams' apology, questions also have been raised about his claim that he saw a body or bodies in the Hurricane Katrina floodwaters that hit New Orleans in 2005.

His remarks in a 2006 interview drew suspicion because there was relatively little flooding in New Orleans' French Quarter, the area where Williams was staying. 

A person at NBC confirmed that Williams stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, which is in an area where a news photographer and a law enforcement official said they saw bodies. 

Nightly News has reigned as the top-rated evening newscast over its competition on CBS and ABC.

Williams' importance to NBC News goes beyond his anchor status, said Al Tompkins, a faculty member for broadcast and online at The Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank.

'He sets the tone of the network. It may not be as critical as when (Walter) Cronkite was CBS' anchor, in every way, but he is more than a face,' he said.

Williams' absence itself is a delicate challenge, according to Tompkins.

'He can't be gone long. The timing will be critical - too short and it won't seem like he has taken himself out of the game long enough, and too long and he looks like damaged goods,' he said.

Replacement: Lester Holt anchors the weekend editions of NBC's Today show and Dateline

Lester Holt anchors the weekend editions of NBC's Today show and Dateline.

The 55-year-old also hosts the weekend edition of the Nightly News.  

He has already spent time in the role he is taking over - having covered for Williams when he was having knee replacement surgery in August 2013.

Holt's first job was as a DJ for a Country and Western station during college. 

Hoping for a career in the entertainment industry, he soon discovered he could only get a full-time job if he reported the news.

The broadcaster spent 19 years with CBS beginning in 1981, when he was hired as a reporter for WCBS-TV in New York City. 

In August 2005, he assumed full-time duties at NBC News, where he became a substitute anchor for NBC Nightly News and Today. 

He then became a full-time co-anchor of Weekend Today following the death of his predecessor David Bloom.

In September 2012 he faced embarrassment after turning up late to a Saturday morning show, because he overslept.

Holt took to Twitter to alert viewers of his frazzled morning.

'For the first time in 9 yrs of hosting weekend @todayshow I overslept!' he posted on his Twitter account.

The executive producer for the show ended up giving Holt a wake-up call at 5:45 a.m and he made a mad dash from his apartment, in the Flatiron District in New York City, to 30 Rock in midtown Manhattan where the show goes live at 7:00 a.m.

He took the lead role during NBC's coverage of the London Olympics in 2012.

And sleep also proved to be scarce for him during his stint across the pond.

He was enjoying a nap on a train ride from London to Alnmouth, in the north of England, when he overslept, missed his stop and ended up in Scotland on August 7.

He had to change trains four times over a time span of nine hours to get back where he needed to be.

But in his typical good humor, the newsman joked about the incident and shared it with his fans over Twitter.

'If ya gotta end up in the wrong place u can do worse than Edinburgh. Catching some quick sights,' he tweeted, adding that on his return trip he would be 'drinking LOTS of coffee.' 

During the coverage of the Sochi Winter Oylimpics in 2014, he downed a shot of vodka with co-host Natalie Morales.
