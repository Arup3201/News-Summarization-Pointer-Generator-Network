Beryl Hope was named by police as another patient who may have died as a result of insulin poisoning at Stepping Hill hospital in Greater Manchester

Police probing the poisoning of patients at a hospital have named a seventh suspected victim.

Stepping Hill hospital, in Stockport, has been at the centre of a probe since July last year after it emerged patients were given saline that had been deliberately contaminated with insulin.

Detectives now believe Beryl Hope, 70, died last August after being given contaminated saline.

They are already investigating the cases of 21 other patients who suffered hypoglycaemic episodes , including six others who have died.

They were Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, Derek Weaver, 83, William Dickson, 28, Linda McDonagh, 60, and John Beeley, 73.

It’s not yet known if the poising contributed the death of Mrs Hope or the other victims.

In a statement, her family said: 'Beryl was a dearly loved wife of 51-years to Ken.

'She was a doting mother and nana to two sons and four grandchildren and is sadly missed by all who knew and loved her.

'A keen dog walker, she also loved holidays to Cornwall.'

Arrested: Victorino Chua, 46, who was held in connection with the murder of three patients

Detective Superintendent Simon Barraclough, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'My thoughts and sympathies are with Beryl’s loved ones who are understandably upset by this latest development.

'We are continually getting new information and data, all of which is under constant review and scrutiny and it is important to stress that this is not a new case but one we have re-categorised following a conference with a number of highly experienced experts and full review of all evidence to date.

Police have described the investigation as 'very complex'.

A male nurse at the hospital Victorino Chua, 46, was arrested in January in connection with the murder of three of the victims - Tracey Arden, Arnold Lancaster, and Derek Weaver.

He was also arrested on suspicion of 18 counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

He’s been bailed until September.
