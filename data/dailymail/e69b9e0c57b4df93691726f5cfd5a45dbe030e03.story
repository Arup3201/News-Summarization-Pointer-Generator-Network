A 9-year-old Texas boy was struck by what some call a freak lightning bolt during a soccer game on August 26, leaving him in a 'semi-vegetative state.'

Alex Hermann of Austin was on the field when he and two others were injured by the bolt before 5pm. But only Alex has been left severely injured--unable to speak, move, talk or hear.

While bystanders claim the strike came out of the blue, Hermann's parents are suing the Lake Travis Youth Association for $10 million on claims they were negligent in getting the vulnerable kids off the field amid the approaching storm.

Terrible: 9-year-old Alex Hermann was struck by lightning on August 26 on a soccer field in Texas and remains in a semi-vegetative state

Outpouring of support: Alex was hit the worst of the three children affected by the lightning strike. He cannot move, speak, or hear

'One practice was ending and another was about to start, and some kids were in the middle of the field, and it came totally out of the blue,' coach Glenn Smith told the Statesman in a statement.

'It was six miles out from the storm is what the weather guys were telling us … we’re having meetings to see if anything else could have been done.'

The elementary school boy was not as lucky as the other two children, who've since been released from medical care.

According to Hermann's attorneys, his and the suffering of his teammates could and should have been prevented.

'Alex Hermann, sustained severe and permanent damages when all of the Defendants failed to comply with the basic safety principles on weather safety when lightning is in the area,' reads the court petition obtained by the Houston Chronicle. 

Heartbreaking: Often seen in photos with his beloved dog, it's now unclear when the boy and his pooch will be reunited as Alex remains in serious conditions and under constant care

'As a result, Minor Plaintiff, Alex Hermann, was hit by lightning and is now unable to speak, hear, talk or move.'

But one safety tool the plaintiffs contend officials at the recreation area should have had, lightning detectors, are prohibitively costly.'Hardly anybody has lightning detectors, and nobody knows the accuracy of them at this point,' Smith told the Lake Travis View. 

'I called a bunch of youth league offices and they don’t have them. It’s a $60,000 investment and we don’t even know much about them.'

Levin and the Hermanns want the $10million for current and future medical care for Alex, whose care Levin says has already reached half a million dollars. 

A GoFundMe page called Pray for Alex has as of Wednesday night received nearly $18,000 in donations.

Suing for $10million: Horror struck at this soccer field just before 5pm on August 26. Some say the lighting bolt came from 'out of the blue' but the Hermanns are blaming the soccer officials they say should have taken the children to safety before tragedy struck
