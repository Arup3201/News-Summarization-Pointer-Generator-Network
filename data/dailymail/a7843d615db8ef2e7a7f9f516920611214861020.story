Many young children would feel lucky to have a full set of grandparents to spoil them on special occasions.

But eight-week-old Lyvia Blaylock is much more fortunate. Not only does she have all four grandparents – she has all eight great grandparents too.

The three generations above her have a combined age of more than 1,000.

Fourteen to one: (front) Becky Bourton and Lee Blaylock with Lyvia; (seated, from left) Rob and Vicky Bourton, Gill and David Blaylock; (standing, from left) Ron and June Bourton, Gordon and Elizabeth Lamprey, Sylvia and Norman Wakeley, Norah and Arthur Blaylock

The amazing longevity is shown by her maternal great grandfather, Gordon Lamprey, a former Army sergeant who is said to still play a mean game of squash at 82.

Another great grandparent, June Bourton, has reached the age of 92.

‘I don’t know what their secret is,’ said Lyvia’s 38-year-old father Lee.

‘If I did I would probably try to bottle it up and sell it. They’re amazing. They still drive and they’re all still active.’

The credit analyst from Swindon decided to record his extraordinary family tree in a photo showing the four generations in their correct positions.

‘It’s the only time they’ve all been together,’ he added. ‘It will certainly be one for Lyvia to remember.’

The photo might never have happened Lyvia's parents suffered four failed IVF attempts

The photo might never have happened because he and partner Becky Bourton, 40, suffered four failed IVF attempts.

One doctor even told the couple, who have been together since 1996, that they had more chance of winning the lottery than having a child. However, after they had given up hope their luck changed.

‘Last September Becky wasn’t feeling too well so she went to the doctor and came home in tears. She was pregnant.

It was a big shock to both of us,’ said Mr Blaylock. Lyvia was born on May 25 weighing in at a 6lb 10oz.
