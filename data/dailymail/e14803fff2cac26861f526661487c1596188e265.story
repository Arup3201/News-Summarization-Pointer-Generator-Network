No other vehicles were involved in the crash, which happened between the 60 and 10 freeways, the California Highway Patrol (CHP) told NBC.

The truck driver is believed to have escaped uninjured.

The incident forced four lanes to close - causing a major traffic build-up, with queues of vehicles stretching for miles, according to transport officials.

However, three of the lanes were later reopened following a huge clean-up operation.
