Every feature, every wrinkle and every hair in this image has been painstakingly designed to create an ultra-realistic model.

The 3D model is based on 77-year-old actress Beryl Nesbitt, and was made using high-resolution scans taken on a 94-camera rig.

Shaders were added to the skin, subtle hairs were added to the body and even the tear ducts were built using layers of digital colour.

This super-realistic model was created by London-based visual effects studio Analog. Designers used high-resolution scans of 77-year-old actress and model Beryl Nesbitt before using a computer to build layers of skin, eyes and even tear ducts

It was created as part of a 3D study into mortality, using a technique known as photogrammetry, and features in the video for Duologue’s single MEMEX.

The video was directed by Marshmallow Laser Feast, which was responsible for U2’s Super Bowl promo Invisible, and its laser ‘Forest’ featured in The Barbican’s Digital Revolutions exhibition.

Duologue worked with photogrammetry firm FBFX to create a full body scan of model Beryl Nesbitt using a 94-camera system.  

The 360º scans were then sent to visual effects experts at Analog.

Analog shot a spherical panoramic high dynamic range photo of a sunset through a window in the studio’s toilet.

The two photographic processes were combined using 3D software so the sunset illuminated Ms Nesbitt’s scanned body parts.

Analog then built realistic shaders for the skin to add definition, wrinkles, highlights and shadows to the model’s features. 

The project was the beginning of a study into filmmaking for the virtual reality environment.

Duologue worked with photogrammetry firm FBFX to create a full body scan of Ms Nesbitt using a 94-camera system.

These cameras were able to scan every inch of the model in high-resolution.

Each scan was captured 360º and at 1/13,000th of a second.

The scans were then sent to visual effects experts at Analog, who have worked with Marshmallow Laser Feast on other similar project.

‘We wanted to go beyond the limits of the audience’s eyeballs - using 3D to reveal different perspectives on the human form,’ explained the band.

‘Obviously the eyes are extremely important in making a 3D person look realistic, so Analog built their own layered eyes and tear ducts.

‘Another thing they added was subtle hairs on the body.’

The scans were then sent to Analog's visual effects, who began building a 3D model of Ms Nesbitt (pictured)

In the video, Ms Nesbitt is shown ‘returning to dust’, so Analog additionally sculpted alternative versions of the model covered in ash-like material.

In addition to the main model, Analog created the realistic cloth and flowers.

‘Once we had decided on camera moves and light positions, every scene was lit and rendered at Analog,’ Duologue continued.

‘Taking this level of detail to real-time virtual-reality environments is our next challenge.’
