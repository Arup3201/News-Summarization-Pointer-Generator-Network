Victim: Makayla Leigh Woods died three days after being shot by Mary Ann Holder

A 15-year-old girl has become the fourth child to die after a woman went on a murderous rampage at the weekend.

Makayla Leigh Woods passed away on Wednesday afternoon after being shot by her boyfriend's mother, Mary Ann Holder, 36, in Greensboro, North Carolina on Sunday.

The news was confirmed by Guilford County Sheriff BJ Barnes.

Holder had also shot her two sons, nephew, niece and married ex-lover before killing herself.

One other wounded child is on life support.

Miss Woods was found critically injured at Holder's home with Holder's nephew Richard Suttles, 17, and niece Hannaleigh Suttles, eight, who were also in a critical condition.

Holder's son Robert Dylan Smith, 17, was already dead. Hannaleigh died on Monday, followed a day later by Holder's 14-year-old son Zachary Smith.

Holder had been having an affair with Randall Lamb, 40, for almost four years, and it was coming to a bitter end Sunday when she arranged to meet him at a community college parking lot.

Police say she shot him in the shoulder and he was expected to recover.

Holder then drove off to meet Zachary Smith. Nearly half an hour after the 911 call from Lamb's wife, a sheriff's deputy spotted Holder's black SUV.

Holder was found dead inside with a gunshot to the head, and Zachary was critically wounded in the back seat.

Authorities said Mary Ann Holder shot both her 
sons - 17-year-old Robert Smith, left, and 14-year-old Zachary Smith, 
right - in the head. Robert was killed instantly, while Zachary 
succumbed to his wounds Monday

Deputies found two handguns inside the vehicle, including one in Holder's lap, the sheriff said.

Officers then went to her home and found the other victims.

The victims appeared to have been shot while they slept in a bedroom and the home's living room, Barnes' chief deputy Col. Randy Powers said.

Police are continuing to investigate
the case. An autopsy has been performed on Holder and police are 
waiting for the results of toxicology tests, but Powers said it 
initially appears there were no signs of drug use.

Holder,
Lamb and his wife had spent months trading accusations of stalking and 
harassment in court documents. Lamb's wife had recently threatened to 
file an alienation of affection lawsuit against Holder, investigators 
said.

Police
are investigating a $10,000 cheque made out to Lambâ€™s wife that Holder 
gave him the day before the shootings, according to an application for a
search warrant obtained by The News & Record of Greensboro.

Police say the cheque may have been for an out-of-court settlement of some kind.

Despite
that, and despite two notes left by Holder taking responsibility for 
the shootings, police say a definite motive is not yet clear.

'This
will be the $64,000 question, because we don't have anyone alive who 
can answer it,' Powers said. 'A couple of theories have gone up in the 
air, but we really don't know yet.'

Richard Suttles remained on life support Wednesday, according Powers.

Holder reportedly had custody of her nephew and niece after their mother died.

Neighbour Joe Scott told WRAL.com: 'It's beyond my imagination that a mother would - good children such as they were - that she would do any harm to precious children.'

Mr Scott's wife Teresa said: Holder's decision to take in her dead sister's children appeared to add to the pressures of what appeared to be a life in turmoil.

Hannaleigh Suttles, eight, had gone to live with her aunt after her mother's death. She is the youngest victim

'Why would you take them children, keep them children, when your life's rocky, up and down?'

Mrs Scott said Holder began renting the home across the street about four years ago.

Holder's children were kind towards the elderly couple across the road, Mrs Scott added.

They volunteered to help with yard maintenance and enquired about the health of her husband Joe, who has had recent health problems.

In the past, Mr Lamb also appeared to like Holder's children, Mrs Scott said. 'They'd pack up things and go places together,' she said.

But it was also clear the affair between Holder and Mr Lamb had soured, according to Mrs Scott.

Robert Smith posted no-trespassing signs on trees in the front yard this year in response to the rising level of tension between Holder and Mr Lamb, Mr Scott said.
