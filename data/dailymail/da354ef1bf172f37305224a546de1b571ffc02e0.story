Nearly three in five New York City grocery stores and restaurants
that sell seafood have mislabeled it, substituting varieties that could cause
health problems, according to a new study.

Some 39 percent of the fish obtained for
the study by the ocean conservation group Oceana was inaccurately identified, the group
said. Sometimes cheap fish is substituted for more expensive varieties or
plentiful species for scarce ones.

Forensic DNA analysis revealed 58
percent of 81 New York
retailers and eateries sampled incorrectly labeled the seafood they sold,
according to the study released Tuesday.

A new study has found that a large number of stores and restaurants - especially in New York - mislabel fish and substitute cheaper fish for more expensive types

‘It's unacceptable that New York seafood
lovers are being duped more than one-third of the time when purchasing certain
types of fish,’ said Kimberly
Warner, a senior scientist at Oceana and an author of the study.

In some instances, consumers unknowingly
purchased fish that could pose health risks.

Blueline tilefish masqueraded as halibut
and red snapper. The Food and Drug Administration urges pregnant women, nursing
mothers and small children to avoid tilefish given its high mercury content.

obtained from sushi restaurants turned out to be escolar, a fish whose
diarrhea-inducing properties earned it the nickname the ‘ex-lax fish.’

Mislabeled seafood can present a public
health concern because many hazards are species specific, said a FDA
spokeswoman.

Allergic reactions and food-borne illnesses are some of the possible health
hazards, the spokeswoman said.

New York's rate of seafood mislabeling
was higher than Miami's (31 percent) but lower than that of Boston (48 percent)
and Los Angeles (55 percent), according to recent Oceana investigations.

What distinguishes New York's seafood marketplace
from those of the other American cities Oceana tested is the presence of
smaller, independent food stores, 40 percent of which sold mislabeled fish,
Warner said.

In contrast, only 12 percent of seafood bought at national chain grocery stores in New York were labeled
incorrectly.

The problem is not new. A study
appearing in a 1992 issue of Consumer Reports found about a third of the
seafood sampled in New York, Chicago, and San Jose was incorrectly labeled.

Nor is seafood mislabeling an issue that
has gone unreported. The discovery in August 2011 that Zabar's, a gourmet food
store on Manhattan, had been passing off crawfish as lobster in its lobster
salad for at least 15 years was the subject of multiple, high-profile media
stories.

The research from Oceana included this table showing the types of fish that were most commonly swapped for another, more expensive type of fish
