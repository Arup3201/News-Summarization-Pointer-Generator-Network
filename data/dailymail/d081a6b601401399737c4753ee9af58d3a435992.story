Ladies over a certain age often feel they should keep their legs firmly under wraps.

But at almost 59, Carole Middleton is spectacular proof that they should do no such thing.

And as if to make her point, the Duchess of Cambridge’s mother has put her shapely legs on show in a pair of eye-catching patterned tights.

A spot of retail therapy: Carole Middleton did a spot of shopping at the Peter Jones department store in London

On a shopping trip in London she cut a
 striking figure in a fur-trimmed short black coat and platform shoe 
boots as she popped in to the Peter Jones store on the King’s Road. 

Critics
 might think the heavily patterned tights struck an overly youthful note
 – but she certainly has the legs to show them off.

And Vogue recently suggested that, after their heyday in the 1980s, patterned legwear is back.

It’s clearly a look Mrs Middleton favours.

Where to next? The new grandmother made a stop by fashion store L.K. Bennett - a firm favourite with the Middletons

She
 wore the same tights and coat to a carol concert, also attended by 
Prince Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas, shortly before Christmas.

Her boots, the appropriately named Royal-Dry by Aquatalia, cost £195 at Russell & Bromley.

Fortunately, given the recent downpours, they are made in weather-resistant black suede.

The
 Peter Jones department store is something of a favourite with the 
Middleton girls – the Duchess of Cambridge was also seen shopping there 
yesterday, without Prince George.

After
 her retail therapy, Mrs Middleton was no doubt planning to spend some 
time with her daughter, who celebrates her 32nd birthday tomorrow.

Her daughter Pippa, meanwhile, opted for a much more casual look than her mother as she stepped out in London.

Dressing for the weather: The 30-year-old sported a low-key no make-up look and wrapped up warm in a £130 Stefanel jumper, casual black jeans and black boots

She's been laying low since her 
romantic holiday with boyfriend Nico Jackson last month but the 
30-year-old looked relaxed and happy as she walked around Chelsea 
chatting on her mobile phone.

The
 Duchess of Cambridge's sister opted for a low-key no make-up look and 
wrapped up warm in a £130 Stefanel jumper, casual black jeans, £125 Vanilla Paris gilet, and 
fashionable black Seven Boot Lane suede boots.

She did add a touch of glamour to her outfit with a £795 Marylebone Tote by Aspinal of London - a favourite of the royals.

Part of the Autumn/Winter 2013 Collection, the Marylebone Tote is handmade from Monochrome Italian Saffiano calf leather and is described by the luxury brand as 'a perfect combination of style, fashion and practicality.

Pippa is in good company with her choice of arm candy, Fearne Cotton has the same handbag and Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's daughter Apple has her own mini version.

Last month news of an engagement
circulated, but a source close to Pippa says her boyfriend, banker
 Nico Jackson, 36, had not proposed.

The
 rumour mill went into overdrive when a US magazine reported that 
Jackson popped the question - and Pippa accepted - while the pair were 
in India at the beginning of December.

The magazine claimed that the couple will walk down the aisle this year.

Stomping ground: Pippa is quite a home in Chelsea, she even used to live with sister Kate in a house just off the King's Road

Has he? US Weekly last month reported that Nico Jackson got down on one knee and asked Pippa Middleton to marry him, but the rumours are untrue
