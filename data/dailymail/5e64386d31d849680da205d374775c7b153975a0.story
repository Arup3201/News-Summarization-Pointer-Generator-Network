Britain is preparing to send around 40 military personnel to Mali to help forces fighting with the French against Islamist insurgents.

Although ministers have stressed British troops will not have a ‘combat role’, the offer goes much further than the air assistance first offered by David Cameron to France.

Contingency plans have been drawn up to send the group – which is likely to include members of the special forces – in a European Union initiative to stop Al Qaeda taking hold of the region.

The move came as soldiers in Paris patrolled the Metro, railway stations and tourist attractions such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre.

Mali rebels declared France had ‘opened the gates of hell’ with its assault and have threatened to attack French targets. France deployed hundreds of troops to Mali on Friday and began a ferocious aerial bombardment of rebel-held areas after its  president Dioncounda Traoré requested assistance.

The British advisers and trainers would help train Malian soldiers and troops from other West African countries. It is understood that some would be based in Mali, while others would work in neighbouring countries such as Ghana, where Britain already has a team.

The mission was described as a ‘small-scale training role if and when ministers ask for it’, and Africa minister Mark Simmonds repeated yesterday there would be no combat role.

However, he said that the crisis was of ‘grave concern’ to Britain because of fears that Mali’s rebel-held north could become a ‘springboard for extremism’. The UK already has a detachment of around ten military personnel overseeing air support in the capital Bamako.

One British official said: ‘This requirement is to supply advisers, not fighting troops on the ground. This is all about influence. Our people can help enhance their tactics and advise them on ways in which to control and win the battle space.’

Assault force: France has admitted that it is coming up against far better rebel resistance than feared in its former colony

Touchdown: A French armoured vehicle disembarks from the plane in Bamako last night. A total of 13 nations have agreed to either send troops, or else supplies and logistical help to aid the effort in Mali

Attack: Rafale fighter planes struck bases used by Al-Qaeda-linked fighters in Gao, the main city in northern Mali and the base from which ethnic-Tuareg rebels launched the offensive a year ago that touched off Mali's descent into chaos

The EU is drawing up plans to send a 150-strong training team to Mali, protected by a security force of 250. In London, however, Parliament’s European scrutiny committee has demanded reassurances that the Mali deployment will not ‘morph into something long term and become bogged down...or lead to a peacekeeping mission’.

Former cabinet minister Peter Hain has warned of the dangers of so-called ‘mission creep’ and being dragged into a ‘long, drawn-out and difficult morass’.

Two RAF C-17 Globemaster aircraft have been deployed to transport French military vehicles, troops and supplies to its former colony.

As French troops pressed north 
yesterday, warplanes led an all-night bombing campaign in an effort to 
dislodge the Islamist extremists who had seized the area, including a 
strategic military camp.

Meanwhile, a convoy of up to 50 
trucks carrying French troops crossed into Mali from Ivory Coast as 
France prepares for a possible land assault.

It already has at least 800 troops in
 Mali, with more arriving every day and the total is expected to reach 
2,500 by the end of the week.

Thirteen nations, most notably Nigeria, have agreed to send troops or supplies and logistical help.
  Islamist groups and secular Tuareg 
rebels took advantage of the chaos that followed a military coup to 
seize northern Mali in April 2012.

They have imposed a brutal version of
 Islam, with girls as young as 12 being flogged for not covering up, 
along with pregnant and elderly women. All music and even mobile phone 
ringtones have been banned.
  At least 11 Malian soldiers and a 
French helicopter pilot have died since the assault began and more than 
100 militants are reported to have been killed.

French officials have acknowledged 
that the rebels are better armed and prepared than they expected. 
Despite the prolonged aerial attack, the fighters have succeeded in 
gaining ground, most notably taking the town of Diabaly on Monday, 
around 250 miles from Bamako.

When the air raids began, the closest known point the rebels occupied was 420 miles from the capital.

In Paris, Manuel Valls, the interior 
minister, said the French were well aware of the dangers of attacks from
 terrorists angered by the military intervention.
