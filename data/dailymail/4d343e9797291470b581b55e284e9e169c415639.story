Here's the latest plaything for the super-rich - a giant three-hulled yacht that cost £15million to make and would fit as comfortably in outer space as it would on the open sea.

Described by Boat International magazine as 'one of the world's most amazing super yachts', the 42.5metre-long Adastra is a floating pleasure palace equipped to entertain a billionaire with even the highest of standards.

She is the the new pet of Hong Kong-based shipping magnate Anto Marden, 64, and his wife Elaine, whose uses for her may include - among other things - gliding between the two tropical islands they already own off the coast of Indonesia.

The giant Adastra is a three-hulled made-to-order yacht that cost $15million to make

The yacht has been described by Boat International as 'one of the world's most amazing super yachts, that could spell the future for efficient long range cruising'

Futuristic: The main deck area looks more like that on a spaceship than a boat

Very little is known about billionaire shipping magnate Anto Marden, the boss of Fenwick Shipping Services, and his wife Elaine.

Mr Marden, 64, is known as a very experienced yachtsman who has spent his life on the high seas for his business and now flitting between islands in the far east and south-east Asia.

He was educated at the expensive Charterhouse School Godalming in Surrey before graduating from the University of Leeds.

Designed by Sussex-based yacht designer John Shuttleworth, the Adastra is so high-tech, it can even be controlled remotely at the touch of an iPad... as long as you don't get any further away than 50 metres.

The yacht's high-concept, space-age look is no gimmick. The shape has 
been specially developed to cut through waves as it glides across the high seas.

Adastra was unveiled in China and took three years to build, as well as two years of planning and design. It is 42.5 metres long, 16 metres wide and weighs 52
tons.

Her enormous petrol tank coupled with her dynamic sailing efficiency allows the Adastra to travel up to 4,000 miles without refuelling - the same distance from London to New York.

‘It takes the power trimaran concept further than has ever been 
attempted before,’ Mr Shuttleworth told Boat International. 

‘The challenge of turning this 
concept into a viable luxury yacht has taken us to further research and 
to develop new thinking on stability and comfort at sea for this type of
 craft.’

It is the result of five years of planning and construction, and rivals anything owned by yacht-lover Roman Abramovich.

The hull of the Adastra is built from glass and Kevlar and can house nine guests and six crewmen. The deck saloon has a panoramic view while the open cockpit has sofas on both sides. The open deck running aft also
has a door that hinges 
out to create a bathing platform.

Boat International magazine said Adastra 'could spell the future for efficient long range cruising'. 

The yacht has an integrated ship monitoring system, and
can even be controlled with an Apple iPad within a 50-metre range.

Adastra is powered by one Caterpillar C18 engine of 1150hp
at 2300 rpm and has 2 Yanmar 110hp @ 3200 rpm outrigger engines.

Adastra's 16-metre beam features a saloon area on the main
deck with a lounge area, dining table, and navigation station.

The deck at the rear of the yacht has a sofa and bar area to
port and a dining area to starboard.

Shiny: As the designs show, the boat has a bathing platform at the back where passengers relax as the it glides effortlessly across the open sea

The main helm station, which has seating for two, is
positioned in a raised pilot house situated between the rear deck and the saloon
area and forms part of the cross beam structure.

The Adastra is the latest in a long line of super yachts that compete to be the most high tech.

Last year Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich bought a £300 million superyacht with two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and submarine.

Eclipse has plenty of room to entertain friends, 
with 15 double bedroom cabins all equipped with their own luxury 
bathrooms and 6ft wide television screens. Parties on the 533ft yacht 
are guaranteed to stay private, as it’s fitted with an ‘anti-paparazzi 
shield’ that fires a laser beam of light at cameras to ruin photographs.

The 20,000 sq ft interior also houses a sauna, steam bath and whirlpool to help guests wind down.

The blueprints put together by John Shuttleworth Yacht Designs Ltd show an incredible boat

Comfy: The deck at the rear of the yacht has a sofa and bar area to port and a dining area to starboard

Blueprints: It was designed by Sussex-based yacht designer John Shuttleworth, a world-renowned boat architect

Early stages: The shape has been specially developed to cut through waves as it glides across the high seas

New build: It is the result of five years of planning and construction, and rivals anything owned by yacht-lover Roman Abramovich

The designers say Adastra is the result of meticulous attention to detail and innovative design

The Adastra can house up nine guests, in addition to six crew members, and travel at a speed of up to 22.5 knots

The boat is fuel efficient, too, able to make it 4,000 miles - longer than a trip from London to New York - without stopping for gas

According to Shuttleworth's website, the yacht's hull is made of glass and Kevlar, while the interior consists of lightweight oak cabinetry using honeycomb panels. To reduce weight, everything on the boat was custom made

The yacht has an integrated ship monitoring system, and can even be controlled with an Apple iPad within a 50-metre range

The style of the Adastra has been described as 'futuristic' by some and akin to an 'alien attack vessel' by others

The boat was built in China for the Hong Kong-based couple and recently launched

The designers said: 'We have undertaken state of the art structural analysis of all the major components in the yacht in order to achieve the light weight required for very low fuel consumption'

The slender hulls and streamlined exterior allow her to travel faster in the open ocean and at 17 knots she has a 4,000 mile range so can comfortably cross both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans at hi-speed

Extensive tank testing and radio controlled model tests in waves have been carried out to analyse stability and performance
