John Downey, who walked free from court after the Hyde Park bomb trial collapsed, has defended joining the IRA

Suspected Hyde Park bomber John Downing has defended joining the IRA, insisting he had to ‘fight fire with fire’.

The case against the 62-year-old collapsed last month after appalling blunders by police and prosecutors.

It meant he walked free from court less than a year after being arrested for one of the IRA’s most notorious mainland atrocities.

His remarks about joining the IRA will cause further upset for victims' families.

On July 20, 1982, a car bomb left on South Carriage Drive killed the soldiers as they rode through Hyde Park in Central London to the changing of the guard.

In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young.

Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace.

The case against Mr Downey collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK.

In his first full-length interview since the Old Bailey case against him collapsed, Mr Downey said he was given his so-called ‘comfort letter’ just days after the Northern Ireland Assembly was set up.

‘As far as the Unionists saying that they didn’t know about the letters, of course they knew,’ he said.

‘I got the letter in 2007, having applied through Sinn Fein in 2003, four years later the application was granted as part of an ongoing process.’

But he went on the defend joining the IRA after watching news reports as a teenager on the unfolding turmoil in Northern Ireland

 ‘I felt that I could not ignore the situation in the north and pretend that my fellow Irish men and women had nothing to do with me,’ he said told his local newspaper, the Donegal Democrat.

‘I could see, at that time, that nothing was going to be accomplished by peaceful means and we had to fight fire with fire.’

More than 30 years after the 1982 IRA Hyde Park Bombing John Anthony Downey was charged with the murder of four soldiers. The case against him has collapsed last month

He was jailed for IRA membership in 1974. But he says he later became dedicated to the peace process and worked to persuade others to give up violence.

‘As far as the letter is concerned this was an arrangement between the British and Irish Government and my arrest was a breach of the agreement reached between the British and Irish government,’ he said.

Travelling to Canada in 2008, he claims the authorities there were assured by British authorities that they had no issue with him.

‘I am told that the reason for my arrest was that I had come up on the police national computer (PNC),’ he said.

‘I had been in and out of Birmingham airport on numerous occasions. I’d also been in Stansted and then on that last day they decided to arrest me.

‘I refuse to believe that if I was on the PNC that I would have gone through all those airports including Derry and Belfast, because that is within their jurisdiction, without being picked up,’ he said.

Lieutenant Denis DalyThe
 23-year-old had been married for just 27 days when he died at the 
scene. The blast tragically happened as his mother was waiting in nearby
 Horse Guards for the mounted troop to arrive. Lt Daly had not long 
returned from a tour in Northern Ireland where his replacement was shot 
and killed by a sniper

Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy BrightThe
 36-year-old was the standard bearer of the Blues and Royals, and died 
in hospital three days after being injured in the blast

Trooper Simon TipperThe 19-year-old had also been married for less than a month, and died at the scene

Lance Corporal Jeffrey YoungThe
 19-year-old was married with two children, aged three and 22 months. He
 died the day after the blast - a week before his 20th birthday

For
 more than 30 years, John Downey has had the IRA bombing in Hyde Park 
hanging over his head - and the families of four victims denied justice.
