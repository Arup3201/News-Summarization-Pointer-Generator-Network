A mother died surrounded by her family after a hit-and-run boating accident during their holiday in the Brazilian rainforest.

Gillian Metcalf was heading to an eco-lodge with her husband and two daughters when their boat was struck at high speed by another vessel.

The 50-year-old died instantly from serious head injuries, but the skipper of the other boat raced off without stopping.

Her family, from Tenterden in Kent, 
have released a picture of Mrs Metcalf that was taken two days 
previously at the Iguazu Falls.

Her
18-year-old daughter Alice, who was also hurt in the accident, said: 
‘It represents what a happy, family-oriented woman she was.

Gillian Metcalf was described as 'super' by her neighbours in Tenterden, Kent

She died 
happy, painlessly and with her family around her.’

And
her husband Charles added: ‘This is an accident which should never have
happened, a pure case of negligence.

Thank goodness my daughters are 
still alive.’

The family 
arrived in the Brazilian state of Amazonas on Wednesday and were heading
to the luxury Juma Amazon lodge, 60 miles south-east of the state 
capital Manaus.

The crash happened on Thursday morning in the Rio Negro as their boat stopped to refuel at a floating petrol station.

Vincent Brown, the British consul-general in Amazonas, said Mr Metcalf had described the accident as a ‘great fright’.

‘They saw the man on the other boat approaching at high speed and the driver of the boat did not help the victims,’ he said.

‘The
family is very upset. It was an act of sheer irresponsibility.’

He 
added: ‘We are not sure if speeding was responsible for the collision 
but the other pilot was not paying attention or looking where he was 
going.

'Every year we seem to have an accident with an English tourist.’

The Brazilian navy has launched an inquiry into the collision and last night seized the boat that is said to have caused it.

The mother had been in a boat with six other tourists when it was crashed into by another craft at high speed. Pictured, a boat trip on Brazil's Rio Negro river (file picture)

Mrs
Metcalf was a founding partner of housing law firm Sharratts, which 
launched in 1999. On her company profile she listed her hobbies as 
skiing, golf, trips to the cinema and reading.

Her
daughters had previously written of their excitement about the family 
trip to South America on Twitter. Alice had posted: ‘Waiting to board 
our third flight of the day to the Amazon!’

And her older sister Natasha had earlier posted: ‘Adios England, see you soon Braziliaa!’

Rooms at the Juma Amazon resort in the heart of the Amazon start from £322-a-night.

Its website states: ‘Juma Amazon Lodge’s goal is to offer a real and unique experience in the untouched Amazon rainforest.’

Holiday of a lifetime: Staying at the eco-lodge costs £320-a-night and rooms line the river on stilts, set in the rainforest

The lodge was built on solid ground and is supported on stilts - necessary due to the flood season, when the river water level rises up to 15 meters
