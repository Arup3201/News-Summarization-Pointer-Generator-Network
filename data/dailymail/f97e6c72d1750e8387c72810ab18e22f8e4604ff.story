The new $100 bill, with an array of high-tech features designed to thwart counterfeiters, will get its coming out party today after being plagued by printing problems.

Benjamin Franklin remains as the face of the bill, but he is joined by a new changing colour ink well and bell and a 3D security ribbon.

The new design bills were previously scheduled to be launched in the U.S. in February 2011, but the Bureau of Engraving and Printing first hit has been set back with printing and quality control issues since 2010.

New design bills: Its production has been plagued with printing issues, but finally - two-and-a-half years later than planned - the new design $100 is being issued to federal banks

The government ran into troubles when 1 billion of the first bills were found in 2010 to have unwanted creases. There was later a problem with ink smearing that further delayed introduction of the new notes.

Then earlier this year, a 'mashing' issue - when too much ink is applied making it impossible to create crisp lines - resulted in at least 30 million $100 bills being destroyed. The problem occurred at one of three printing factories and set back issuance of the new design by several more months.

But officials say the problems have now been fixed. Michael Lambert, Deputy Associate Director at Board of Governors Federal Reserve System, said in a video statement that 'issuance was delayed until the Bureau of Engraving and Printing resolved some unexpected production challenges.'

Larry Felix, the director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing said the bureau is now confident it has resolved the various production issues.

Today, the Federal Reserve will transport the highest value American currency in armored trucks from its regional banks around the country headed to banks, savings and loans and other financial institutions with the new notes.

Being rolled out: Americans could get their hands on a new bill as early as tomorrow. The government reminds people their existing $100 notes will remain usable

Some bank customers could start seeing
the new bills, which took a decade to redesign, by Tuesday afternoon 
depending on how close their bank is to a regional Federal facility.

'We
have 3.5 billion of these notes which we think will be more than ample 
to meet domestic and international demands,' said Sonja Danburg, program
manager for U.S. currency education at the Fed.

The
bill redesign, the first for the $100 bill since March 1996, will still
have Benjamin Franklin on the front and Philadelphia's Independence 
Hall on the back.

In 
addition, there is a disappearing Liberty Bell in an ink well and a 
bright blue three-dimensional security ribbon with images that move in 
the opposite direction from the way the bill is being tilted. The number
100 also shifts from copper to green.

'The 3-D security ribbon is magic. It is made up of hundreds of thousands of micro-lenses in each note,' said Mr Felix, the director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

'This is the most complex note the United States has ever produced.'

Improvements: Compared with the existing $100 bills, there is an additional blue ribbon, a changing colour Liberty Bell, and tiny inscriptions along Franklin's collar

The $100 bill is the last bill to get a make-over in a process that began in 2003 with the $20 bill.

The government redesigned the greenbacks with subtle colours and other security features to make it harder for counterfeiters.

The $100 bill, which is the most commonly counterfeited note outside of the United States, was redesigned with even more complex security features.

Officials stressed that the $900 billion worth of $100 bills currently in circulation will remain good and will only be gradually phased out as worn-out bills are returned to Federal facilities.

The $100 bill is the largest U.S. denomination in circulation and has the longest life at 15 years. The $1 bill lasts 5.9 years.

The new $100 bills will have one old feature. The signature on the bills will be that of former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The signature of current Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, who has been teased by President Barack Obama for his loopy handwriting, will start appearing once the current supply of new bills has been put into circulation.
