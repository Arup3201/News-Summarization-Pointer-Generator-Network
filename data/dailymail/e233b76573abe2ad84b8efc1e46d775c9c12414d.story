Left: Sakita Covington, 38, left four children under the age of 4 alone in her apartment when she went to go get one of her sons from school

A babysitter has been arrested after a 4-year-old girl she was meant to be watching died when left unattended in the sitter's apartment.

Naira Bennett was found trapped in a folding futon and rushed to a Newark, New Jersey hospital but pronounced dead hours later after doctors were unable to revive her.

The babysitter, Sakita Covington, has been taken into police custody and charged with child endangerment and aggravated assault.

Naira was one of four children that Covington, 38, left alone in her apartment in a housing complex on Wednesday morning.

All of the children were under the age of four.

The Star-Ledger reports that Covington asked a friend who lived in the same complex to watch the children while she rushed out to pick up one of her sons from school but the neighbor told her that she would not be able to until later.

'When I got upstairs the baby was in the futon,' the friend told ABC7 without revealing her name.

'I don't know what happened. I wasn't there.'

One of the other children was another one of Covington's sons. The three children who were with Naira at the time were unharmed.

An autopsy is being performed which will determine the official cause of death and give more clues as to what happened.

Police were called to the apartment at 10.45am on Wednesday and shew as transported to University Hospital.

Naira was not officially declared dead until 7pm that evening.

It is unclear where the surviving children are currently but Covington is in police custody.

Naira's mother does not face any charges in connection to her daughter's death.

Dangerous: The incident happened in Covington's apartment in a Newark housing complex called Bradley Court (pictured), where a number of drug busts and shootings have taken place in the past

Covington's apartment is in Bradley Court, a housing complex that has a history of drug busts and violence, including an incident last year where someone opened fire and killed a mother of four.

'I think it's very stupid to do that because anything could've happened and look what happened,' Covington's neighbor Iesha Wiggins told ABC7.
