Australia's latest role in Iraq has received the backing of UN chief Ban Ki-moon, as the prime minister warns the ongoing mission carries risks.

Within days RAAF aircraft will fly to the Kurdish capital Erbil to provide small arms, ammunition and aid as part of a US-led effort to fend off Islamic State militants.

The UN Secretary-General says it's important nations such as Australia help address the situation in Iraq.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott defended the risks associated with the mission by stating they 'are reasonable given the importance of the missions'

'Without addressing this issue through certain means, including some military and counter-terrorist actions, we will just end up allowing these terrorist activities to continue,' he told reporters in Auckland on Tuesday.

Australia's international standing will go up a notch when Foreign Minister Julie Bishop accepts this week a formal invitation for the nation to become an 'enhanced partner' of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.

Although not a member, Australia's engagement with NATO has grown steadily in recent years especially through the mission in Afghanistan.

Ms Bishop is heading to the NATO summit in Wales as Prime Minister Tony Abbott warns of further risks involved in the Iraq mission.

However he talked down reports of an Australian C-130 Hercules aircraft undertaking the country's second humanitarian airdrop to the town of Amerli, being shot at by extremists last weekend.

The C-130 Hercules had been flying as low as 300 metres above the ground to deliver 15 packages of water, food and hygiene parcels, when it was shot at by both heavy machine guns as well as smaller arms, News Corp Australia had reported.

Opposition leader, Bill Shorten has also expressed his support saying 'providing the Kurds with light weapons, the opportunity to defend themselves against people who would kill their families, to me is the only logical choice here,'

However Mr Abbott said: 'I'm not advised that they came under direct fire themselves'.

Defence chief Mark Binskin tweeted there were no reports the transport came under fire, but ground fire was 'not unusual in a war zone'.

Mr Abbott said risks should be expected.

'Obviously, flying humanitarian air drops into combat zones are full of risk. But the risks are reasonable given the importance of the missions they're flying.'

The US Defence Department said in a statement US aircraft had conducted three air strikes against nearby Islamic State terrorists in support of the Amerli airdrop, but all aircraft safely exited the area.

Labor leader Bill Shorten restated his support for the airdrops and weapons airlift but acknowledged there were easy options there.

'Providing the Kurds with light weapons, the opportunity to defend themselves against people who would kill their families, to me is the only logical choice here,' Mr Shorten said.

He later told Labor caucus the party would not support putting Australian troops on the ground in Iraq.

Mr Abbott told a coalition joint party room meeting there had been no requests for combat troops and there was a 'world of difference' between the war in 2003 and today.

'What we do will be done with appropriate due process,' he said.

'We want to make sure that we know where the arms and munitions go when we deliver,' Air Chief Marshal Binskin said on Sunday at a joint press conference with the Prime Minister.

'They will be landing and handing them over to officials from the Peshmerga.'

The SAS soldiers are believed to be at Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates and will accompany the RAAF C-130J Hercules and C-17A Globemaster aircraft when the equipment is transported, Fairfax Media reports.

'This is about what is right for our country and what is best for our world,' Mr Abbott said on Sunday.

He described the situation overseas as 'severe' and spoke of a specific type of terrorist 'who hate us not because of what we do, but because of what we are'.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott responded to the request from the Obama Administration

Mr Abbott said he agreed to join the US-led effort and Australian forces had already participated in a humanitarian airdrop to northern Iraq.

The Prime Minister also assured that no specific request to step up Australian military involvement in the area had been made and if we were asked the decision would be made under very specific criteria.

Meanwhile, Greens senators were outraged by the decision the Abbott government made without the consultation of parliament, The Age reports.

Independent Andrew Wilkie is said to have told reporters in Hobart that cabinet should have had an input on the matter.

'If Tony Abbott wants us to be gun runners for the Kurds at the behest of the United States then we are part of the war,' he said, according to the website.

The Iraq government and other regional countries will co-ordinate Australia's contribution.

The US has stepped up its strikes against Islamic militants in northern Iraq this month, and is considering extending air strikes to Syria.

Since August 8 the US has conducted more than 80 air strikes, according to Central Command.
