The director of a reality show in which a Brazilian woman auctioned her virginity could be charged with sex trafficking offences.

Catarina Migliorini is set to earn £490,000 from the online auction which closed last Wednesday.

The physical education student  was taking part in a documentary by Australian film-maker Justin Sisely, entitled Virgins Wanted.

Catarina Migliorini, 20, who sold her virginity online for $500,000 to a Japanese bidder named Natsu

The winning bidder is a Japanese man called Natsu. The pair will  reportedly sleep together on a plane between Australia and the US in a bid to avoid prostitution laws.

But yesterday Brazil’s attorney general, Joao Pedro de Saboia Bandeira de Mello Filho, ordered an ‘urgent’ investigation, claiming the auction amounted to ‘people trafficking’.

In a letter to Brazil's Foreign Minister he said Mr Sisely should be stopped from ‘executing the crime’ and called on authorities in Australia, where Miss Migliorini lives, to revoke her visa and deport her back to Brazil for ‘the exercise of prostitution’.

He said: 'In prinicipal this looks to me like the crime of people traficking, whose repression is provided for in international treaties.'

Natsu fended off strong competition from American bidders Jack Miller and Jack Right, and Indian big-spender Rudra Chatterjee, to secure a date with the 20-year-old.

Miss Migliorini vehemently denied being a prostitute on the basis she was only selling her body the one time

Catarina's decision to sell her virginity sparked outrage across the globe, with many claiming she was little more than a prostitute.

She also caused controversy when she revealed she would be followed every step of the way by an Australian crew for a documentary film called Virgins Wanted.

The intercourse itself will not be filmed and Natsu will retain a right to be anonymous, without his picture appearing in the media.
