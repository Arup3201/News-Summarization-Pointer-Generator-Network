Disqualified: Steven Tull pictured outside Worthing Magistrates' Court

A motorcyclist who was recorded doing the highest speed in the country when he was caught travelling at 152mph on a Sussex road, was today disqualified from driving.

At the time he was caught, in October last year, it was the fastest recorded speed caught on traffic cameras to date.

Engineer Steven Tull, 37, of Liphook, Hampshire, was sentenced at Worthing Magistrates' Court for dangerous driving, speeding and driving without a valid test certificate.

Defence lawyer Marie Lewiecki told the court that Tull lives with his wife in Hampshire but works in Oxfordshire and would struggle with his commute if he lost his licence.

Judge Roderick Hine sentenced Tull to a 12-month driving disqualification - the minimum he could impose.

Tull was also ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work and to pay £620 prosecution costs.

Judge Hine said: 'I know you find it hard to accept your driving was dangerous.

'The reason you were convicted of dangerous driving is what could have happened.

'You could have been involved in a fatal accident, it was an unbelievable speed.

'You could have lost control of the vehicle putting other people at risk.'

Tull was caught at 1.49pm on October 16 last year travelling at 152mph on his Yamaha R1 motorbike on the A27 at Binstead in West Sussex.

Prosecuting Andrew Perry told the court Tull recorded the highest speed on any camera in England in 2011.

He said: 'He was driving in the presence of other traffic the behaviour of which he is unable to predict.

'He wouldn't be able to see further than a white van which he overtakes.

'The potential for an accident is very apparent even without taking into account stopping distances.

'He is ascending a hill and there is a blind crest on the top of the hill and a junction which again he cannot see.

'There is potential for conflict with
other motorists, if he comes into contact with other vehicles at that 
speed it's obvious he will be in an accident and possibly a fatal one.'

He added that Tull was wearing dark colours and riding a dark bike making him harder to spot. 

Camera technician Christopher Snell was operating the camera which caught Tull.

He was on the opposite side of the dual carriageway when he saw the motorbike.

And then... Tull was then spotted going at 153mph just four seconds later

He said: 'The first thing I was aware of was the sound, I could hear clearly a large motorcycle engine.

'As I looked across I was pointing with the laser and as he went past me I knew instantly without a shadow of a doubt he was travelling at more than double the speed limit.

'It was phenomenal.'

Mr Snell first recorded Tull as travelling at 139mph then four seconds later at 152mph. 

The court heard from Mr Snell that he had seen two fatal accidents and that on the day of the incident the traffic was 'medium to light' and most cars were travelling at the recommended speed limit. 

Defending, Marie Lewiecki told the court that over 20 years Tull has never had a previous speeding offence.

Mr Tull told the court during his evidence that he had had a 'momentary lack of discipline.' 

He said: 'There was no reason to keep accelerating. It was a mistake, I shouldn't have exceeded the limit.'

The court heard that in interview after the speeding offence Tull admitted he had been speeding but that he didn't know how fast he was going.

District Judge Hine said: 'He is approaching the bow of a hill. His evidence is that he could only see 250 metres or so.

'He would have had less than four seconds to stop. More significantly there is a van which is plainly blocking his view. He would not have known if there was a vehicle in front of that van going slowly.'

He added: 'The fact that nothing happened is nothing short of good fortune. The defendent had no idea what speed he was driving at any stage. I find that incredible.

'I have raised the issue of road kill which is relevant when we are talking about country roads. If you hit an animal not only would you fly in the air and kill yourself but you could hit someone else.

'For all those reasons I find him guilty of dangerous driving.'
