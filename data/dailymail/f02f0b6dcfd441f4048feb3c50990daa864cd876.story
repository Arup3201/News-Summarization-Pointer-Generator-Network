A former soldier who claimed to have fought off a Vietnamese gang, like karate super-hero Bruce Lee, has failed to win his claim for post-traumatic stress disorder after a judge ruled that his tales were 'totally incredulous'.

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal were told of the night Norman Olsen had been at a bar in Hong Kong, when he became involved in a fight with a gang of 12 armed with weapons in the 1970s.

The Queenslander said he was able to take on each of the 'crazed lunatics... screaming and yelling' at him as they came with batons that had spiked two-inch balls attached to the ends.

He detailed how he was able to escape with an injury to his elbow.

Mr Olsen argued that such events left him with post-traumatic stress disorder and took the matter to the AAT for an appeal after it was initially rejected.

'In relation to the Hong Kong Bar incident, The account Mr Olsen gave conjured up images of a scene out of a Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee (pictured) movie, Mr Olsen playing the role of the super hero,' tribunal member Marella Denovan said on March 4

Tribunal member Marella Denovan was not reasonably satisfied  and consequently knocked back with Mr Olsen's claims on March 4.

'In relation to the Hong Kong Bar incident, the account Mr Olsen gave conjured up images of a scene out of a Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee movie, Mr Olsen playing the role of the super hero,' Dr Denovan said.

'It is totally incredulous.'

A number of psychiatrists gave evidence, as Dr Denovan concluded Dr Bradley Ng's to be the most reliable.

Dr Ng questioned the legitimacy of the accounts of events provided by Mr Olsen, saying that the former soldier talks quite boastfully about punching and assaulting people while claiming to have been in fear in Vietnam.

Dr Ng further opined that there is a high chance that Mr Olsen has an antisocial personality disorder, saying he 'fails to conform to social norms at times, and has gross impulsivity and marked irritability and aggressiveness'.

The psychiatrist then stated that 'people with antisocial personality disorder tend to deceive and distort accounts'.

Dr Denovan said there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in Mr Olsen's claims, which the digger acknowledged and attributed his earlier accounts of the incidents to his illness.

But Dr Denovan handed down the decision that Mr Olsen was 'an unreliable witness'. 

'I have concluded that Mr Olsen has a sincere belief that his psychiatric illness/s are due to his experiences in Vietnam, however he is an unreliable witness, and he was not exposed to the events the diagnosis of PTSD relies upon,' Dr Denovan said.

'I therefore find that on balance, Mr Olsen suffers from generalised anxiety disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and alcohol misuse.'
