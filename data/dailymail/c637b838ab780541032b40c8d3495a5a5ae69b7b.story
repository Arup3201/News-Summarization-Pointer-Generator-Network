She attracted gasps of horror from sticklers for tradition when she turned up at the Royal Wedding without a hat - but one thing the buttoned-up brigade couldn't criticise was Samantha Cameron's green Burberry dress.

The pleated silk shift was the perfect choice for the day - colourful, elegant and the right side of demure without sacrificing style.

Bidding war: The price of the dress, which originally would have cost around £1,000, has already reached £310

And now, in honour of the charity Save The Children, Samantha Cameron is set to part with the dress.

The PM's wife is to auction the dress as part of the new #bidboutique initiative, set up by eBay UK in partnership with the British Fashion Council.

The dress, on sale via eBay UK, has 
attracted 22 bids so far, with bidding reaching £310, although the final amount 
is set to be far higher though, with a flurry of last-minute bids 
expected to flood in.

Other
items to be auctioned include dresses by Temperley and Peter Pilotto, a Jimmy Choo bag,
a Mawi necklace and an Alexander McQueen lace dress.

Feelgood fashion: The #bidboutique intiative was set up by eBay UK in partnership with BFC to raise money for Save The Children

The auction runs until 23 September. Bid on Samantha Cameron's Burberry dress at eBay.co.uk
