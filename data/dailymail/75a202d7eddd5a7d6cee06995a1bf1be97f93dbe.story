E-cigarettes must be subject to much more stringent controls to ensure they are safe, leading health experts have warned.

More than 100 of them have sent an open letter to the  World Health Organization, outlining their concerns about what unregulated products may contain.

They fear manufacturers of electronic nicotine devices are 'making false and unproven claims, misleading the public into thinking these products are harmless (they are not) and effective cessation aids (which is unknown)'.

Manufacturers of e-cigarettes are 'making false and unproven claims, misleading the public into thinking these products are harmless, health experts have warned

The letter, to WHO director general Margaret Chan, is in response to one sent last month by 53 other experts.

It was written after information was apparently leaked that the WHO wanted to class e-cigarettes as a tobacco product because they were a 'threat'.

In the letter, the experts argued that e-cigarettes could be among the most significant health 
innovations of the 21st century and could save millions of lives .

Another new study published in a special supplement of Tobacco Control,
 found that the market of e-cigarettes is growing rapidly.

Researchers
 from the U.S. sought to identify the number of these products available 
online.

They did two separate internet searches of English language 
websites, the first between May and August in 2012 and the second 
between December 2013 and January 2014.

In the period between searches there was a net increase of 10.5 new brands and 242 new flavours every month, they said.

By January 2014, they identified 466 brands with 7,764 unique flavours.

As a result, they stated they should not be classed as a tobacco product, which would restrict their access - and have huge consequences on public health.

But the latest letter, organised by tobacco scientist Stanton Glantz of the University of California, San Francisco, urges the opposite - and calls for more rigorous investigation into the devices.

The group of 129 experts from 31 countries wrote: 'By moving to the e-cigarette market, 
the tobacco industry is only maintaining its predatory practices and 
increasing profits.

'The aggressive marketing and promotion of 
e-cigarettes to youth is well documented and evidence shows rapid growth
 in youth e-cigarette use, including disturbing rates among youth who 
have never smoked a cigarette.

'From a population perspective it is important to know what new risks a consumer product may introduce to the market.'

E-cigarettes use battery-powered cartridges to produce a nicotine hit 
via inhalable vapor without the tar and other carcinogens in inhaled 
tobacco smoke.

The latest letter says manufacturers should be required to present data that show the products are safe and help smokers quit, and disclose ingredients in the 'vaping' liquid the devices burn.

Regulating e-cigarettes like tobacco products, the signatories wrote, is necessary to prevent young people from starting to use them, protect bystanders in public areas from involuntary exposure, regulate marketing, and ban unsubstantiated claims.

Figures show that e-cigarettes are most commonly used by ex-smokers - often as away of giving up or cutting down on regular cigarettes

They add thatÂ  although e-cigarette vapor has fewer toxic components than regular smoke, more than half a dozen studies have shown it can include ultrafine particles damaging to lungs, plus 'carcinogens and reproductive toxins, including benzene, lead, nickel, and others'.

The WHO is assessing its position on e-cigarettes, and has indicated it is leaning toward restrictions like those on all nicotine-containing products, including banning advertising and flavours.

The call comes as new research showed that almost 30 million people around Europe have tried the battery operated nicotine products.

A new study published in the journal Tobacco Control Found that 20.3 per cent of current smokers, 4.7 per cent of ex-smokers and 1.2 per cent of people who had never smoked had tried an e-cigarette at least once.

The researchers, from  Imperial College London, the US and Greece, say that when the figures are 
extrapolated, this means 29.3 million European adults have tried 
the products.

But they added the scientific community is yet to provide information regarding the harm or efficacy of e-cigarettes.

Health, financial and social reasons are factors why people use e-cigarettes, according to a recent poll
