What do Reese Witherspoon, Gwen Stefani and Jessica Biel have in common?

They all shunned the traditional white wedding gown when they got married, preferring instead to marry in colourful dresses.

And it seems that where they lead, others follow. According to the latest study, a quarter of young brides are now turning their back on white dresses to wear red, pink and blue instead.

The research found that 27 per cent of 18 to 24 year olds would not get married in traditional white.

Pretty in pink: Like five per cent of women, Jessica Biel and Reese Witherspoon opted for a pink gown on their big day

Nearly one in ten (nine per cent) would wear a red dress, one in 20 (five per cent) would emulate Jessica Biel and don a pink one and four per cent would marry in blue.

In contrast, the survey found 85 per cent of 35 to 44 year olds would still get married in white.

The research also explored the colours we associate with different events and emotions.

It found that red is largely seen as the colour that represents love while yellow was the most popular choice to represent happiness.

Women are most likely to say that their mother has had the greatest impact on their colour choices.

In contrast, more than a third of men said their favourite sports team had influenced their choice of favourite colour.

Karen Haller, of 3M, who carried out the survey, said: 'It's interesting that mums have had a great impact on their daughters.

'We all know what colour tones we are drawn to and those we aren't, it's just a matter of trusting our intuition.

'Men will often choose their team's colour as it gives them a sense of belonging.

'As human beings we have an innate need to belong to a tribe. In essence, they are creating an emotional connection through colour.'
