The daughter of one of America's most notorious mobsters has opened up about growing up in gangland, and even the moment Frank Sinatra thought he might die because he knocked a champagne ice bucket on her lap, in a new tell all book.

Meyer Lansky's gambling empire stretched from Las Vegas to Havana, with his partners in crime, Lucky Luciano and Bugsy Siegel, and he was so feared even international superstar Sinatra quivered in his presence.

His daughter, Sandra, lived a lavish life funded by the proceeds of dirty dealing, and while her sprawling apartment on New York's Central Park had a terrace so big it served as a skating rink, friends were hard to come by because of her powerful father.

In the book, 'Daughter of the King: Growing Up in Gangland,' Sandra describes how daddy would take her to Broadway shows where the ushers knew his name and to famous supper clubs with her many mobster 'uncles.'

According to an excerpt in the New York Daily News, it was in one of these supper clubs, The Riviera club in New Jersey, where she and 'Daddy' ran into Sinatra.

She recalls one night, when she was 10 or 11, Sinatra came over to their table to say hello after his set.

She said she felt very grown-up, out 'on the town' with Daddy but Sinatra was less excited.

'I had never seen anyone so nervous as Frank, particularly a star who had all the teenagers in New York screaming for him,' Sandra writes. 'But Frank was more fidgety in Daddy's presence than any bobby-soxer would have been in his.'

She said the crooner was so anxious that when he reached over to shake her hand, he knocked over an champagne bucket of ice, which was chilling her ginger ale, into her lap.

'He nearly died,' she remembers, adding 'Maybe he was worrying about dying for getting me all wet. Maybe Daddy had given him one of his looks.'

Either way, he quickly Frank got on his knees and began frantically drying her off with a bunch of napkins.

He only relaxed when she began laughing and said that he was tickling her.

She said the twinkle returned to he father's eyes, and Frank began to breathe easier.

The singer then gave her a big hug, as if she had saved his life by forgiving him.

The Daddy's girl grew up into her own gangland character, 'Mob Deb,' she explains in the book, with her own table at glamor spots like El Morocco.

She married at the tender age of 15.

However, her playboy husband turned out to be a 'gay fortune hunter' so she quickly moved on to dating movie stars who introduced her to drugs.

Sandra became addicted and was falling fast.

However, the handsome Gabby Harnett saved her.

She writes in the book, co-authored by William Stadiem, that she thought Harnett was the one, until he revealed himself as an undercover cop who wanted her to inform on her father.

Sandra ran to daddy and Meyer Lansky, as always, made things right, she said.

The first time she became aware of his murderous ways was early October of 1951, when her father took her to dinner with 'Uncle Willie' Moretti - the underboss of the Genovese family.

The pair chatted about Havana and her Daddy was 'quiet, thoughtful and a little sad' as they reminisced about old times.

Willie turned to Sandra and joked that Lansky took her mother on honeymoon with the gangster Dutch Schultz. 'Is that any way to treat a lady?' he said.

At that, the mob boss became uncomfortable and asked for the check.

The next day at school she noticed one of the school janitors was reading a newspaper with Uncle Willie on the cover.

She said she almost burst out with how she had dinner with him last night. Then she read the other half of the paper. 'Dead!' it said. 'Mob Boss Exterminated in N.J.'

And he was pictured in a pool of blood lying on the tile floor of a bar.

'I ran to the bathroom and threw up,' she writes.

When Harnett asked for her help as an informant she ran straight to Daddy, who she said forgave her for not realizing sooner.

He then decided to 'use him.'

'The plan was to feed Gabby and the FBI disinformation to send them on wild goose chases. He gave me a list of names to drop, names and places,' she recalled in the Daily News excerpt.

She said they had a few more dinners, and numerous meetings that included FBI agents.

But then she became distracted with a guy from a major Mafia family, Vince Lombardo.

Vince wasn't in the Mafia himself, she writes, but he was 'perilously close.'

She said her father would only let the pair marry if Vince promised to stay out, under any circumstances, of the Mafia for the rest of his life.

'Vince made the deal,' she said.

Lansky denied many of the accusations against him and despite all the reports, the U.S. Justice Department never found him guilty of anything more serious than illegal gambling.

He died of lung cancer on January 15, 1983, age 80, worth almost nothing on paper. However, the FBI believe he had over $300 million in hidden bank accounts.
