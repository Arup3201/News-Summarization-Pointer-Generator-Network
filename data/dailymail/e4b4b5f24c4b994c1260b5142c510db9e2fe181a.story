Wished you could Hoover early in the morning but don't want to wake the whole house up? Or want to pop the washing machine on at night but don't want to keep your neighbours awake?

Such dilemmas could soon be a thing of the past, as the launch of the world's quietest vacuum heralds a wave of 'silent' gadgets. Here, FEMAIL puts them to the test . . .

Hoping to do an early morning wash but worried about waking the whole house up? There's a hush-hush solution

HAIRDRYER

Ghd Air, £99.95, Decibels: 55  (compared with average of 80)

Hairstylists love this hairdryer because they can still talk over its hum

WHAT IT CLAIMS:

Improved motor technology means the average noise level of a hairdryer has been reduced from 100 decibels ten years ago to 80 or fewer -  the level of a standard telephone dial tone and slightly quieter than the noise of city traffic from inside a sealed car.

At 55 decibels, this is little more than a steady hum, which allows you to talk as you dry.

AMANDA'S VERDICT: Hairstylists working behind the scenes at catwalk shows love this dryer because they can still speak over the small but powerful 2,100-watt motor, which has two heat settings.

I chatted to a friend happily while I dried my hair. The downside is that I became distracted and ended up with a 'do' like Einstein.

RATING: Perfect - especially if, like me, you have a teenage daughter who seems to use the hairdryer all day.

8/10

Stylish - but, at £120, a costly way to buy a little peace and quiet

KETTLE

Kitchenaid Artisan, £119.95, Decibels: 60 (average 80)

WHAT IT CLAIMS: Has a dual- wall construction like a Thermos flask, with two skins and airspace inside that traps the sound and stops the angry bubbling noises made by most rapid-boil kettles.

AMANDA'S VERDICT: So stylish I could happily forgive it for whistling louder than Thomas The Tank Engine. But I flick the button, wait for the boil crescendo and - nothing. There is a low, constant sound but not the angry bubbling I'm used to.

Does kettle noise actually bother me, though? At nearly £120 this is a costly way to buy a little peace and quiet.

RATING: The Kim Kardashian of kettles - gorgeous but expensive!                                                                                                                                          

6/10

It's not the smallest or lightest of hoovers, but it is very quiet

VACUUM CLEANER

Bosch GS-50 Power Silence, £249.99,  Decibels: 66 (average 86)

WHAT IT CLAIMS: The quietest vacuum cleaner on the market - so quiet you can vacuum when the children are in bed and the TV is on. A new motor compresses the air intake to reduce sound.

AMANDA'S VERDICT: I scoffed at the TV ad showing a scientist wheeling this new-fangled vacuum around a sleeping tiger. But I tried it out at home while Dylan, our spaniel cross, lay sleeping. He has a terror of vacuum cleaners, which means any vaccuming noise is made worse by the sound of his barking. But he didn't wake once.

Compared with my faithful Henry vacuum, this sounded as if it was producing half as much noise. It's not the smallest or lightest model but would be perfect for anyone who lives in a flat or shares a house.

No screech, and no scattering of children holding their ears

RATING: At last you can watch EastEnders and vacuum at the same time.              

10/10

FOOD MIXER

Magimix cuisine 5200xl Premium, £369.99, Decibels: 70 (average 90)

WHAT IT CLAIMS: The quietest food processor around. Even on the chopping function, there is just a gentle whirr.

Winner of a prestigious Quiet Mark award from the Noise Abatement Society. 

AMANDA'S VERDICT: Experts say that any sound above 85 decibels can damage the ear - so each time I use my trusty old Kenwood at home, I really am suffering: it registers more than 92 decibels and sounds like a helicopter landing in the garden. I place this Magimix next to it and flick the switch.

No screech, no scattering of children holding their ears. Nor does it vibrate.

RATING: Used by TV chefs so they can talk to camera as they chop and blend.                   

8/10

DISHWASHER

So quiet, I couldn't tell if it was running

Bosch SMS69L32GB, £575, Decibels: 38 (average 52)

WHAT IT CLAIMS: This clever machine takes more than 140 knives, forks, saucers and cups but is so quiet you'll hardly know it's on. It takes 132 minutes to complete a cycle.

AMANDA'S VERDICT: This has a time delay so you can set it going after midnight for lower energy costs, but it's so quiet it won't wake the family.

I tried mine during the day and couldn't tell if it was running, so had to open the door to see (getting a steam facial in  the process).

RATING: I like to know if my dishwasher is on. If you don't mind a slightly louder one - 42 decibels - try the Siemens iQ700. This has a clever gadget that projects the remaining time and exact progress of the washing cycle onto your floor, so you don't open it in mid-flow.              

5/10

Noiseless, but also very expensive

WASHING MACHINE

Miele W5872, £999, Decibels: 49 normal wash, 73 spin (Average 55 and 88)

WHAT IT CLAIMS: Contains an extra-quiet mode to run your machine at a reduced noise level during quiet periods, such as at bedtime.

Uses a special wash rhythm that allows your clothes to soak and gently wash with less spin and noise.

AMANDA'S VERDICT: My washing machine screams the house down on spin cycle but this is so quiet I could sleep beside it. Any washing machine will be quieter on a concrete floor than a wooden one.

RATING: Very quiet but expensive.

I was able to empty the ironing basket without missing a word of Bake Off

STEAM IRON

Philips PerfectCare Silence, £300, Decibels: 30 (average 60)

WHAT IT CLAIMS: The quietest ever steam-generating iron. Winner of an award from the Noise Abatement Society.

AMANDA'S VERDICT: Irons are not terribly noisy but can be annoying if you try to alleviate the drudgery by watching telly.

Steam generators work when you press a button by releasing steam via a pump from a water tank. This increases the steam but creates a loud rumbling noise followed by a bellow of steam. 

In contrast, this iron was almost completely silent. I was able to empty the ironing basket without missing a word of Bake Off. Perfect.

RATING: Quiet even when you press the steam button - a silent dream.
