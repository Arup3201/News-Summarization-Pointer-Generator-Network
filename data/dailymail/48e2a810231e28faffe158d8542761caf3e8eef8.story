A pitch invader sprinted onto the pitch during Real Madrid's friendly clash with Italian outfit Fiorentina in Warsaw -  and the rogue even tried to get involved in a set-piece routine. 

But he was fooling no-one despite having Cristiano Ronaldo's name emblazoned across his back. 

The invader doesn't quite get a touch on the ball and can be seen having a quick chat with Madrid striker Karim Benzema before being escorted off the pitch.

Ronaldo gave the European champions the lead after only four minutes. 

But goals from Germany striker Mario Gomez and ex-Bolton and Sunderland defender Marcos Alonso turned the game around. 

It's not the first time a pitch invader has tried to get involved in the action at a sporting event.

Here's how you do it: The invader gives Benzema some advice before making his way off the pitch

Infamous prankster Karl Power flagrantly joined the team photo for Manchester United's Champions League quarter-final with Bayern Munich at Old Trafford in 2001. 

Although other United players noticed his presence Power managed to stay on for the photo. 

He also walked out to bat when England's cricket team played Australia the same year 

Power has also played tennis against Tim Henman at Wimbledon, danced the haka for the England rugby team and beat Michael Schumacher to the winner's podium at Silverstone. 

But United banned him for life when he reenacted a Diego Forlan goal against Liverpool with some pals on the Old Trafford pitch in 2003.
