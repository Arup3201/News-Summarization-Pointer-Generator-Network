Daniel Sturridge has named Thierry Henry, Ronaldo and Robbie Fowler among his goalscoring idols growing up as a kid.

The Liverpool and England striker took to Instagram on Thursday to upload pictures of the trio alongside a further six heroes of his.

The completed list of stellar names include Dennis Bergkamp, Tino Asprilla, Rivaldo, Gianfranco Zola, Ian Wright and Nicolas Anelka.

Captioning the pictures Sturridge wrote: 'Long love the idols...Fowler,bergkamp,asprilla, Ronaldo,Henry, Rivaldo,Zola,wright, Anelka... Always pay homage to those who came and conquered.'

The 25-year-old will be dearly hoping to emulate Kop legend Fowler at Anfield, who scored 183 goals in 369 games, after impressing already during his 20 months at the club.

Sturridge has netted 36 goals in 52 appearances for Liverpool, and is currently fighting his way back to full fitness after picking up a thigh injury on international duty earlier this month.
