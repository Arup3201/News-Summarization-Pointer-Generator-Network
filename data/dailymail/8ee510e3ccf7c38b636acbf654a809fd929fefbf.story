Iraqi government forces fled the country's second city yesterday as it was stormed by an al Qaeda group that torched buildings, seized weapons and set hundreds of prisoners free.

Security forces ran in terror from the city of Mosul after Islamic militants captured the city - raising black banners marking the Islamic State above seized security bases, police stations and government headquarters.

Dramatic photographs showed military vehicles ablaze last night after members of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) captured Mosul.

Fearing for their lives, hundreds of families fled the city - a majority Arab area with Assyrian, Turcoman and Kurdish minorities - in a bid to make it to safety.

The eventual fall of the city on Tuesday followed four days of fierce fighting in Mosul and the surrounding area - and came as government forces in the region appeared to collapse.

Yesterday, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki pressed parliament to declare a state of emergency following the action.

The loss of Mosul marks a heavy defeat 
in Baghdad's battle against a widening insurgency by the breakaway 
al-Qaida group which has been
 trying to seize territory both in Iraq and 
neighboring Syria.

Earlier this year, the group captured
 another Iraqi city, Fallujah, in the west of the country, and 
government forces have been unable to take it back after months of 
fighting.

The far larger Mosul is an even more strategic prize for the extremist group.

The city and surrounding Ninevah province are a major export route for Iraqi oil and a gateway to Syria.

Mosul, where a majority of the population are Arab (with Assyrian, Turcoman and Kurdish minorities), is located in northern Iraq, close to the borders of Turkey, Syria and Iran

Regaining Mosul poses a daunting challenge for al-Maliki.

The city has a Sunni Muslim majority and many in the community are already deeply embittered against his Shiite-led government.

During the nearly nine-year American presence in the country, Mosul was
 a major stronghold for al-Qaida and U.S.

Iraqi forces carried out 
repeated offensives there, regaining a semblance of control but never 
routing the insurgents entirely.

Insurgents
 overran the Ninevah provincial government building in the city - a key 
symbol of state control - in the evening, and security forces fled many 
of their posts.

The fighters stormed police stations, bases and prisons, capturing weapons and freeing prisoners.

On
 Tuesday, Mosul residents said the militants appeared to be in control 
of several parts of the city, raising the black banners that are the 
emblem of the Islamic State.

The residents spoke to The Associated Press by telephone on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety.

In
 a nationally televised press conference Tuesday, al-Maliki asked 
parliament to declare a state of emergency, acknowledging that militants
 had taken control of 'vital areas in Mosul.'

He said the public and 
government must unite 'to confront this vicious attack, which will spare
 no Iraqi.'

Mr al-Maliki admitted: ‘Iraq is undergoing a difficult stage.’  He said the public and government must unite ‘to confront this vicious attack, which will spare no Iraqi’.

Regaining Mosul poses a daunting challenge for Mr al-Maliki.

State TV said parliament would convene Thursday.

Under the constitution, parliament can declare a 30-day state of 
emergency on a two-thirds vote by its members, granting the prime 
minister the necessary powers to run the country. Legal experts said 
that could include powers to impose curfews, restrict public movements 
and censor the media.

'What
 happened is a disaster by any standard,' parliament speaker Osama 
al-Nujaifi - a Sunni from Mosul - said in a televised address.

'The presence of these terrorist groups in this vast province ... 
threatens not just the security and the unity of Iraq, but the whole 
Middle East,' he said.

He 
said militants had seized helicopters at Mosul airport and captured 
weapons depots, and captured several villages and a military airbase 
further south in Salahuddin province, he said.

Residents began fleeing Mosul - though the size of the flight was not yet clear.

The fall of Mosul deals a serious blow to Baghdad's efforts to fight Sunni militants who have regained ground and momentum in Iraq over the past year and pushed into Mosul last week

Police, military and security officials said  the insurgents, armed with anti-aircraft weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, had taken over almost all police and army checkpoints in and around the Mosul

A
 government employee who lives about a mile from the provincial 
government building, Umm Karam, said she left with her family Tuesday 
morning.

'The situation is
 chaotic inside the city and there is nobody to help us,' she said, 
speaking on condition she be identified by a nickname for fear of her 
safety. 'We are afraid ... There is no police or army in Mosul.'

The
 assault in Mosul is also a sign of Iraq's reversals since American 
forces left the country in late 2011. Militants ramped their insurgency 
back up over the past two years.

The Islamic State has presented itself as the Sunni community's 
champion against al-Maliki's Shiite-led government as the group fights 
on both sides of the border in what Iraqi officials have said is an 
attempt to carve out an enclave for itself in western Iraq and eastern 
Syria.

The group, which 
was once al-Qaida's branch in Iraq, was thrown out of the terrorist 
network after it expanded its operations in Syria against the orders of 
al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri. It is considered one of the most 
ruthless rebel forces fighting to topple President Bashar Assad in 
Syria, where it has in seized a major city in the east and other 
territory.

Two Iraqi army officers said security forces had received orders to leave the city after militants captured the Ghizlani army base in southern Mosul and set more than 200 prisoners free from a high security jail

The retreating army and police forces set fire to fuel and ammunition depots in order to prevent the militants from using them, the Iraqi officers said

In Iraq, the 
group rose up earlier this year to take over Fallujah and parts of the 
nearby city of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province. It has also been 
carrying out a campaign of bombings and other violence in Baghdad and 
other parts of the country.

In
 the Mosul fighting, insurgents armed with machineguns and 
rocket-propelled grenade launchers stormed the provincial headquarters 
building late Monday, overpowering guards in a short firefight, 
according to Ali Mahmoud, the media official for Ninevah province.

He
 confirmed accounts by Mosul residents that many of the police and army 
forces that had been stationed in the city had disappeared by Tuesday.

Provincial
 governor Atheel al-Nujaifi, the parliament speaker's brother, was in a 
nearby guest house. He managed to escape the area and left the city, 
though he continues to monitor the situation, Mahmoud said.

On Monday, the governor had urged residents to fend off the attackers.

'I
 call upon the men of Mosul to stand firm in their areas and to defend 
them against the strangers and to form public committees in their 
districts to help their people and to protect their areas,' he said in a
 transcript of a speech posted online.
