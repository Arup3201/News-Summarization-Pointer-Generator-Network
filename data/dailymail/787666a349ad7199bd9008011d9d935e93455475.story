If you visit West India Quay today in the shadow of the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, you’ll find a £550-a-night Marriott hotel and thousands of wealthy bankers.

But back in 19th century East London, it was a bustling storage area for goods imported from the West Indies.

The West India Docks were built to great fanfare at the end of the 18th century as a response to overcrowding and theft in the riverside quays.

At the time, it was the largest and most expensive building project in the world, costing £82million in today’s money and stretching for almost a mile.

The Ledger Building - now a JD Wetherspoon pub - was where dock records were kept and the original gateway was just beyond this point.

Manual workers at the docks were employed as casuals, and would queue at the dock gates for the ‘call-on’ when some would be chosen to work.

These men were often half-starved and desperate to work - but if they were picked, their jobs were backbreaking.

In addition, the abrasive sugar leaking from the sacks rubbed their necks, shoulders and hands raw - giving the quayside the old name of Blood Alley.

The docks were heavily bombed during the
Blitz and after the Second World War the warehouses were replaced by 
modern storage sheds.

These
no longer exist but you can still see cranes used in the 1960s, before 
dock closures began in the 1970s, mainly due to containerisation.

The London upriver docks were not large 
enough to receive the new ships - and so the Tilbury Docks down the 
river in Essex were developed.

The
building then became derelict - but in 2000 work began on restoring and
converting the Grade I-listed building for use as a museum.

Now, the Museum of London 
Docklands sits in one of only two remaining warehouses erected on the 
north quay by the West India Dock Company.

Originally
built in the 1800s by wealthy merchants and slave plantation owners, 
these buildings once held great cargoes of sugar, rum and coffee.

Each storey was once a different height - dictated by the cargo's nature. The ground floors were made to store two tiers of hogsheads of ‘clayed’ sugar.

The upper floors stored a single tier of the heavier hogsheads of muscovado sugar, while the top floors held lighter cargoes such as coffee and cocoa.

Now the wider area of Canary Wharf is one of London's two main financial centres and is home to the likes of Barclays, HSBC and KPMG.

The 97-acre estate got its name from the fact that many of the imports which arrived there in the past when it was a dock were from the Canary Islands.

Around 15million sq ft of office and retail space now exist on the site, with the first tenants arriving in 1991. Now more than 93,000 people work there.
