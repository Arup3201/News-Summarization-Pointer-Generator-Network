Public health reforms which would have pushed up the price of alcohol and forced cigarettes to be sold in plain packets were missing from the Queen’s Speech.

Health campaigners expressed dismay at the omissions, with Tory MPs with some Tory MPs warning David Cameron not to try to outflank the UK Independence Party as the party of  'beer & fags'.

But the ideas were shelved to focus on the economy and tackling immigration, to avoid being seen to add to the cost of living for hard-pressed families.

David Cameron and Nick Clegg vowed instead to focus on backing people who 'work hard and want to get on'.

They promised measures to boost ‘fire up’ the private sector, increase pensions and protect consumers.

But today's Queen's Speech did not contain expected legislation on tracking internet use, a register of lobbyists and enshrining in law a promise to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid.

However, the government came in for fierce criticism for the lack of any public health policies in today's statement.

The government has quietly dropped a string of ideas it planned to include in this year's Queen's Speech.

Government sources insist ministers want to focus on issues which matter to voters, and not adding to living costs or red-tape.

Among the coalition's ideas not included were:

Mr Cameron championed the idea of a minimum unit price for alcohol, arguing it would curb problem drinking.

But it was opposed by the George Osborne’s Treasury, Home Secretary Theresa May, Education Secretary Michael Gove and former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley.

Just weeks ago it was reported that the government would also press ahead with laws forcing tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plan packets, copying rules introduced in Australia last year.

The Smokefree Action Coalition - an alliance of more than 100 health charities, unions, royal colleges and campaign groups - today wrote to the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary to 
implore them to introduce the measure.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted the ideas had not been dropped altogether. ‘We haven’t made a decision,’ he told BBC Radio 4.He said plans in Scotland for minimum alcohol pricing had been challenged in the courts, while Australia’s cigarette laws only came into force in January.

Mr Hunt added: ‘It’s a much harder job to assess the evidence as to how effective it will be and that takes time. And I want to make sure we do the job properly so I’m going to take the time that I need to.’

There was speculation that the move was a reaction to the rise of UKIP, whose leader Nigel Farage has promised to scrap the smoking ban in pubs.

During the local election campaign, he was regularly pictured smoking with a pint in his hand.

But Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, a former
 GP, has repeatedly called for action to tackle problem drinking. She 
tweeted: 'We shouldn't compete with Farage by looking like a Party which
 promotes beer & fags.'

She also raised questions about the role played by Lynton Crosby, who has been hired as chief Tory election strategist.

His PR and lobbying firm Crosby Textor was on a retainer for British American Tobacco when the industry was trying to block plain packet laws in Australia.

Dr Wollaston added: 'Did Mr Crosby have any involvement in advising on dropping these public health measures?

'Whatever your views on minimum pricing we deserve clarity about advice from lobbyists at the heart of Govt & a Free Press to challenge.'

A plan to create a register of firms which lobby the government to have policy changes has also been dropped.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 'Two key public health policies have been dropped since Lynton Crosby arrived in Downing Street.

'David Cameron needs to come clean about whether Crosby had any involvement in these decisions.

'From the outside it looks very much like a right-wing lobbyist is dictating the coalition's public health policy.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband also raised questions in the Commons about why the government 'dropped the Bill' after Mr Crosby's arrival.

However, a Downing Street source denied Mr Crosby had any influence over policy.

'Mr Crosby has not lobbies the Prime Minister on anything. There has not been any impact on the Queen's Speech whatsoever.'

Mr Crosby does not had a desk in Number 10 or a pass to enter Downing Street, the source added.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is under pressure over the decision not to legislate on plain cigarette packets, while questions have been raised about the role Tory election strategist, who has worked as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry

Dr Mark Porter, chairman of council at 
the British Medical Association, said he was 'bitterly disappointed' 
that the measures were omitted from the Queen's Speech.

Dr Porter added: 'If the Government U-turns on its pledge to deal with alcohol and tobacco related harm, we will have to question its commitment to protecting the nation's health,' he said.

'A minimum unit price for alcohol would result in a decrease in thousands of alcohol related deaths.

'Ultimately taxpayers pay the price as the NHS picks up the bill for the damage to health and lives lost from tobacco and alcohol related causes.'

Health groups also urged the government to act to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes.

Dr Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, added: 'There is strong evidence that removing glitzy designs from cigarette packs makes them less attractive to children, increases the impact of on-pack health warnings and stops tobacco companies misleading consumers about the harm cigarettes cause.

'If the Government is serious about improving the nation's health and stopping so many people dying early - which it says it is - it must reconsider its decision and push for the early adoption of standardised packaging.'

Legislation: Cigarettes would have been sold in plain packaging under the plan which has been shelved

Laws passed in Australia mean cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking

Deborah Arnott, chief executive of 
health charity Action on Smoking Health (Ash), said: 'If the Government 
cannot find the courage to act, then Parliament must be given the chance
 to decide, as it did with smokefree legislation.'

But Jorge da Motta, managing director of Japan Tobacco International UK, said: 'The decision of the UK Government not to include plain packaging in the Queen's speech reflects that the regulatory principles of evidence based policy not policy based evidence are being observed.

'The tobacco control lobbyists have attempted to convince MPs that plain packaging will discourage young people from taking up smoking; they have tried to use emotion to circumvent the Government's own consultation process and to close down any debate.'
