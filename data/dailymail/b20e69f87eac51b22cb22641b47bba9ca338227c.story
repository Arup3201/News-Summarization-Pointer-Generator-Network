Authorities say it's now too late for Queenslanders to evacuate and Brisbane residents have been urged to start sandbagging as monster Cyclone Marcia bears down on 30,000 people in its direct path.

The core of the category five cyclone is now starting to affect parts of the central Queensland coast, with the town of Yeppoon to feel the full brunt of its winds and its destructive storm surge, which could destroy low-lying homes.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has warned Queenslanders to brace themselves for a 'terrifying experience' – but what makes some cyclones so much worse than others?

Tropical cyclones are categorised from one to five based on the wind speed, with category five winds surpassing 280km/h.

Category five storms – such as Cyclone Marcia – are classed as extremely dangerous and cause widespread destruction.

Cyclones produce gale-force winds, torrential rain and storm surges that can cause extensive damage and lead to flooding, landslides and dangerous sea conditions.

Geoscience expert Jonathan Nott said Cyclone Marcia was more intense than Cyclone Lam, which hit the Northern Territory overnight.

'It has basically stronger winds and as a consequence of that will be generating stronger onshore winds onto the coast, which means it will generate a bigger storm surge,' said Prof Nott, from James Cook University.

How cyclones are named varies among meteorological organisations and countries.

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology created a list with 104 names before the 2008-09 cyclone season. There were three lists before then.

In the 19th century an Australian forecaster, Clement Wragge, used the names of South Sea Island girls, and then later used the names of the wives of politicians he disliked. When an especially destructive cyclone affects Australia, its name is retired. 

'This one's also going towards major urban centres and the onshore winds and the storm surge could start impacting on Yeppoon where there are lots of beachfront properties.

'We are approaching a very high tide in the next hour or two, and the peak for the very high tide will coincide with very strong onshore winds at Yeppoon.'

Prof Nott said he Premier Palaszczuk was 'absolutely right' to say the storms will be 'terrifying'.

'The wind is extremely strong, enough to knock trees out of the ground and break tree branches off,' he said.

'Then they because missiles, their impact on dwellings can punch holes in walls and start to cause structural breakdown of house. That's going to be the problem.'

Tropical cyclones are intense low-pressure systems that form when the sea-surface temperature is above 26.5C, drawing their energy from warm tropical waters.

They can last for days but usually dissipate when they move over land or cooler water.

Severe tropical cyclone Tracy is probably the most infamous of Australia's cyclones.

At least 66 people died when Tracy, a category four storm, struck Darwin early on Christmas Day, 1974, virtually flattening the city with winds near the eye estimated at 260km/h.

Despite its intensity and incredible destructive power, Tracy was tiny. The World Meteorological Organization recognises Tracy as the world's smallest tropical cyclone, with gale force winds extending only 50km/h from its eye.

Cyclone Yasi, which struck the far north Queensland coast in February 2011, is one of the largest cyclones to hit Australia in recent years.

It was a category five storm, the most intense on the Australian cyclone scale, with a peak wind gust of 285km/h.

Prof Nott said Marcia had the same intensity as Cyclone Yasi, which devastated Queensland in 2011, but it was smaller in diameter.

'It won't impact along as great a length of coast,' he said.

Cyclone Larry landed the tropical north Queensland coast near Innisfail as a category four storm in March 2006.

The cyclone causes severe damage worth more than $500 million to infrastructure and crops, and damaged 10,000 homes. No lives were lost and no serious injuries were reported.
