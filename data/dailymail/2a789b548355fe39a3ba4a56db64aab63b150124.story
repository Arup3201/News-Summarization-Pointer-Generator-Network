A grand piano found dumped in the East River has become an unlikely New York City attraction as hipsters and tourists flock to see the waterlogged instrument.

Pictures of the of the Mason & Hamlin piano started surfacing on social media last week and now the instrument - submerged at high tide but almost entirely exposed at low tide  - has become the star of local photoshoots and global Instagram and Twitter posts.

Hashtag art? Instagram users have been posting stylish snaps of a mystery waterlogged piano discovered underneath Brooklyn Bridge

The origins of the musical machinery 
remain a mystery, and theories about how it arrived under Brooklyn Bridge
 range from it having fallen off a passing truck to it being a secret art 
installation, or that it has floated downstream after being dumped by a 
frustrated maestro.

Some local 
musicians have been attempting to tickle the soggy ivories, but despite containing
 all of its original parts, the 300lb piano is too damaged to work.

Off-key: According to local media the piano has been there for a few days puzzling locals as to how it got there

Amy Kan, 26, of the city's West Village, decided to bring her cello along after trying unsuccessfully to play the piano on Friday, and told the New York Post: 'I
 stumbled upon it a few days ago and wanted to bring my friend to see it
 . . . It’s here making people happy. I’m hoping it just showed up,'

Photographer Carlos Chiossone told NBC 4 New York he was walking by on Monday and saw what appeared to be a photo shoot on the piano, complete with umbrellas: 'But then they left, and the piano is still there'.

It's not clear who would be charged with moving the piano. The City Parks Department says the beach is not under their jurisdiction.

Meanwhile the silent instrument continues to delight and mystify New Yorkers, who have even started a Twitter account for their new star attraction.
