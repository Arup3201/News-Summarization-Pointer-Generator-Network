The Jamie Osborne-trained Toast Of New York will bid to become just that when he attempts to win the inaugural running of the US$1.25 million (£730,000) Belmont Derby on Saturday night.

The English raider, who sprung to prominence with two huge margin wins at Wolverhampton last winter, announced himself on the world stage in March when running away with the Group 2 UAE Derby in Dubai for rider Jamie Spencer.

Installed as 3-1 favourite on the morning line in the States, Toast Of New York has delighted Osborne since crossing the Atlantic.

'He looks fantastic and he’s been eating and drinking well since shipping to New York,' he said.

'We’re going slightly into the unknown with him since his best races have come on synthetic surfaces but he trains well on turf so I don’t foresee it being a problem.'

Toast Of New York will be joined in the field by the Aidan O’Brien-trained Adelaide.
