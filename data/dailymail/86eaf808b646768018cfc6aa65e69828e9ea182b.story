A Russian woman hanged herself after having drunken sex with her ex-boyfriend, behind her new partner's back.

Alina Bogdanova was found lifeless by Aleksandrs Zuks, 29, the next morning, after the pair rekindled their romance, an inquest today heard.

The 28-year-old blonde had spent the night of October 25 last year with her ex-boyfriend, who lived with her brother in Spalding, Lincolnshire.

Mr Zuks found the 28-year-old's lifeless body the morning after the pair rekindled their romance last October

Giving evidence at an inquest at South Lincolnshire Coroners Court, Mr Zuks, said: 'We slept together after she came to my bedroom.

'I fell asleep with her beside me but found her the next morning. I thought she was standing on the stairway next to the wall.

'I started talking and asking what she was doing there and when I came closer I realised that her bottom lip was blue.'

At the time of her death, Miss Bogdanova was in a relationship with fellow Russian Arturas Pakalniskis, who lived in Peterborough.

He told the inquest: 'She was very happy. She wasn’t depressed.

'I knew Mr Zuks lived at her brother’s address but I was not concerned (about her visiting the house).

'She just said that "I am going to see my brother" and that was it.'

South Lincolnshire assistant coroner Siobhan Kelly recorded a verdict of suicide. A friend paying tribute said: 'Alina was a beautiful person. People thought she felt guilty about cheating on Arturas which is maybe why she killed herself but we will never know. It is so tragic. She was so full of life'

Miss Bogdanova’s brother Arnis told the hearing he had arranged for his sister to sleep in his room while he would use the sofa downstairs.

He told the hearing he text her to say 'come to bed' and she replied 'sleep well'.

The next morning she was found dead on the landing.
