Roger Baker, 66, ran his vet practice in Whitstable, Kent, for 40 years but injected himself with a legal drug after becoming 'overwhelmed' with debt

A vet killed himself with a lethal injection of a drug used to put animals down after becoming 'overwhelmed' by debts, an inquest heard.

Roger Baker, 66, successfully ran his veterinary practice in Whitstable, Kent, for 40 years but became overwhelmed by VAT debts and Inland Revenue demands which threatened to close his business.

The father-of-three was found dead in a shed close to his practice on April 19 by his wife and son after they went looking for him when he failed to return home, an inquest heard today.

He had left several suicide notes on his desk, which were each contained neatly in envelopes and addressed to his family members, including his wife Georgina.

A post-mortem examination revealed he died from a fatal overdose of a drug usually used to euthanise animals, and CCTV footage showed him unlocking the dangerous drugs cabinet and taking out several bottles and syringes prior to his death.

Mr Baker's wife told the inquest at North East Kent Coroner's Court today that her husband had refused to disclose the scale of his financial difficulties to her.

The 65-year-old said she was 'unaware' of the letters from Inland Revenue, but said that her husband would have not wanted to cease trading because he would be deemed 'a complete failure'.

She told the hearing: 'He had no intention of retiring. If he couldn't do that anymore, to him, life would not be worth living.'

Mrs Baker said she, along with her son Christopher, 30, found the suicide notes on her husband's desk having let themselves into his surgery when he failed to return home from work.

She told the coroner said: 'As soon as I read the first line, I knew immediately what had happened.'

Her son added: 'It was obvious to me it was a suicide note from a man who was depressed and didn't want to carry on.'

The pair called 999 and a search of the building and outbuildings by police found Mr Baker lying on the floor in a shed, with a syringe next to him. Paramedics confirmed he was dead.

Following his death, Mr Baker's surgery in Whitstable, Kent, has been taken over by Lady Dane veterinary centre (pictured) after his family asked the company to take over the business and retain the staff members

Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Ian Goldup said: 'The deliberateness of his actions, the interpretation of the notes and the circumstances of his death leave me in no doubt that he took his own life.'

An investigation by Kent Police concluded there had been no third party involvement or foul play. 

Mr Baker, who served as vice-chairman of Conservative Animal Welfare, started working at his surgery in 1973.

Following his death, his family approached the Lady Dane veterinary centre in Faversham, Kent, which took over his practice and retained the staff.
