A tractor pulling a cart full of watermelons bearing a racially charged sign stirred controversy at a small town Fourth of July parade last week.

‘White history month,’ was emblazoned on the side of farmer Donnie Spell’s float in a Hope Mills, North Carolina parade Thursday. The sign also read ‘HUG WTE PPL.’

And as is chugged along the parade route waving a Confederate Flag, many residents took offense to the racial implications.

Courtin' controversy: Hope Mills, North Carolina farmer Donnie Spell tacked a sign with racial implications to his 4th of July parade float

Hope Mills Director of Parks and Recreation Kenny Bullock oversaw the parade entries. He told WNCN there was no mention of the signs on Spell’s float application.

According to Bullock, Spell only listed that he’d be parading with 8-10 antique tractors, one with a trailer of watermelons for sale.

Bullock said he asked the Spell family to remove the sign. Indeed, a photo of the trailer can be seen on the Hope Mills Chamber of Commerce website without it.

But apparently the sign was placed back on the trailer of watermelons because photos clearly show it as the tractor and its Confederate flag pulled through town.

What sign? A chamber of commerce photo snapped before the parade shows no sign. Director of Parks and Recreation Kenny Bullock said Spell was told to remove the potentially offense sign

Implications: The sign was clearly replaced, however, and toted alongside a Confederate flag

Alicia Jones was attending the parade with her young son and said she was completely taken aback by what she saw.

‘At that time his innocence was broken, and I had to sit there in the parade and explain to my son what that, at seven years old,’ Jones told WNCN. ‘I mean it really caught me off-guard.’

Bullock and town commissioner Pat Edwards said Spell had been in parades before. In the past, he was allowed to display his antique tractors as he did Thursday, and even to wave the Confederate flag.

Shocked: 'It really caught me off-guard,' said attendee Alicia Jones. She had to explain the sign to her 7-year-old son

This year, though, he took things further.

‘I know where they're coming from,’ Edwards said of the townspeople like Jones who couldn’t believe what they saw. ‘I know some of them were hurt by it, and it's just something that happened, and I'm sorry it happened.’

While other trailers bore signs like ‘I didn’t vote for Obama’ and ‘God loves rednecks,’ Spell’s was just too much, said Jones.

‘I think there needs to be an apology, and he needs to not be able to submit,’ she said ‘to be in any parade again.’

Bullock is considering creating clearer, more specific guidelines for future parade entries but said he’s unsure if Spell can legally be banned from pulling his tractors during next year’s festivities.

Apology: 'I know some of them were hurt by it, and it's just something that happened, and I'm sorry it happened,' said commissioner Pat Edwards
