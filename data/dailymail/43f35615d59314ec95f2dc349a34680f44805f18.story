Alastair Cook has accused India of ‘making a mountain out of a molehill’ over the altercation between Jimmy Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja in Nottingham in an attempt to nobble his star bowler and destabilise England’s efforts to beat India.

Anderson could face a four-match ban after being hit with a 'Level Three' charge by the ICC after India complained that he had shoved Jadeja in the Trent Bridge pavilion on the second day of the first Test.

England have responded by bringing a Level 2 charge against Jadeja for his part in the contretemps, leaving Cook to accuse the Indians of doing their best to get Anderson out of the team.

I know what they're doing! Alastair Cook thinks India's pursuit of James Anderson is all mind games

Alleged altercation: James Anderson and Ravi Jadeja exchanged words at Trent Bridge

Article 2.3.3 of ICC's Code of Conduct

'Where the facts of the alleged incident are not adequately or clearly covered by any of the above offences, conduct that either: (a) is contrary to the spirit of the game; or (b) brings the game into disrepute'.

Level 3 penalty

All Level 3 breaches carry a penalty of between four and eight Suspension Points. Two suspension points equates to a ban of one Test, or two ODIs, depending on which type of match is scheduled next for the suspended player.

Asked whether he thought the Indians 
were motivated by the thought of depriving England of their spearhead in
 a gruelling five-Test series, Cook replied: ‘I think so. I think that’s
 pretty much where it’s come from.’

Cook
 was unable to talk in detail about the incident, which remains under 
cricket’s equivalent of sub judice while the ICC consider the charges 
brought by England. But he did make it clear the dressing-room’s 
surprise that the incident has escalated to this extent.

‘We’re
 surprised it’s come to the situation it’s come to,’ he said. ‘But we 
can’t let it be a distraction to us. For Jimmy, all the lads can rally 
around him – he’s a stalwart of our side, an outstanding bowler with a 
fantastic record.

‘It’s
 probably a tactic a little bit from India if we’re being honest, and we
 just can rally around him. Hopefully he can get this ball swinging at 
certain times in this Test match and Jimmy can let his cricket do the 
talking.’

Would the Indians’ reporting of Anderson make him even more determined to end England’s winless streak of nine Tests?

Cook
 replied: ‘Hopefully, yeah – for me as a captain that would be great. As
 a side we don’t need any more motivation because we haven’t won for a 
while. But if it does bring us even closer together and support each 
other more during the tough times, that would be welcome.’

England
 believe the altercation has been blown out of proportion and kept 
in-house, and that Anderson’s history of needling opposition batsmen has
 counted against him now.

‘I
 think it should be on that incident or this incident,’ said Cook. ‘To 
be honest with you, it’s a big mountain out of a molehill.’

Will
 he tell Anderson to tone it down? ‘I don’t think I will. We have a 
responsibility as players who play for England not to cross that line. 
In the heat of the battle, when emotions are up, there have probably 
been situations throughout everyone’s careers when people can look back 
and wish they hadn’t done that.

‘I
 don’t think this is the case. I like it when Jimmy’s in that battle, 
because he’s up for it. People love watching a competitive guy.’

But India captain MS Dhoni insisted Jadeja had been blameless in the incident, and that the correct process had been followed.

‘We
 felt what happened was wrong,’ he said. ‘Let’s realise that this is not
 something we have done. We can do a press conference and I can choose 
to answer questions or not answer them, but in no way can I touch you. 
Certain things need to be followed.

‘We’ve been on the receiving end before. Someone else starts something, and we retaliate and we’re the ones who get in trouble.

‘It
 was good that Jadeja didn’t do anything. I thought he addressed it in 
the most appropriate manner. Someone had to back off at the right time.’

Asked
 if he thought Anderson’s behaviour constituted a serious breach of the 
ICC’s Code of Conduct, Dhoni replied: ‘Definitely. It’s what we think.’

ROOT ROCKED (June 2013)

The angelic looking Joe Root winds up Australia opener David Warner so much in the VIP area of the Walkabout bar in Birmingham that the loudmouth Aussie punches the young Tyke.

BROAD WALK (July)

The mother of all rows erupts when Stuart Broad edges an Ashton Agar delivery to Aussie captain Michael Clarke at first slip. Incredibly, umpire Aleem Dar fails to spot the huge nick, Broad stands his ground... and there follows all manner of hypocritical spoutings from Aussies over not walking.

TROTT TORMENT (Nov)

Bully boy Warner is at it again, this time with the verbals, saying Jonathan Trott is ‘poor, weak and looked scared’ facing Mitchell Johnson. Trott was already on his way home, suffering from a ‘stress-related condition’.

MANKAD MESS (June 2014)

Controversy at Edgbaston as  Sri Lanka spinner Sachithra Senanayake — who himself was later suspended over a suspect action — runs out England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler for backing up too far, a dismissal known as a Mankad. The bad blood spills over into the Test series.
