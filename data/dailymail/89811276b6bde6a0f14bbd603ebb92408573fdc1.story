Forget the Little Black Dress this winter, for British women it's all about thick black tights.

A major UK retailer has reported sales of opaque stockings and tights are 112 per cent higher than the same time last year.

Experts say the Duchess of Cambridge's penchant for the thick hosiery has helped put the sock-drawer staple back on the fashion map.

Retailers have seen a huge spike in the sales of black tights, some experts believe that the Duchess of Cambridge may have had influence after she was seen wearing the legwear throughout her tour of New York

A Debenhams spokesman said: 'We have seen a 112 per cent growth in sales this season so far, which is huge.' 

They added that they had seen the sales of the garments steadily rising since 2013.

'Even sales of black tights in spring/summer 2014 and spring/summer 2013 were up in comparison to previous seasons.'

Although Britain is experiencing cooler temperatures, with the mercury set to fall even further next week, experts say that it's the catwalks, not weather, that have made 50 deniers cool again. 

Sophie Reynolds, a spokesperson for Debenhams, said: 'Black tights are a functional winter staple and always a catwalk favourite.

'They are a practical way to stay warm, while still looking chic.'

Fashion and beauty editor Lisa Haynes agreed: 'Unlike previous autumn/winter seasons, coloured and patterned tights aren't on trend so we're all going back to black.'

'Even Kate Middleton switched her trusty sheer nudes for black opaques for the royal tour of New York.

'Designers like Hedi Slimane for Saint Laurent have put the cool factor back into black tights.

'He teamed every single look on the autumn/winter 2014 catwalk with black opaques, bringing mini-length hemlines into the real world.'

Lisa added that the hosiery may be the hot accessory right now but their neutral colour means they can remain apart of your wardrobe for months to come. 

'Black tights are the affordable ticket to versatility,' she said.

Designers have helped encourage the trend. The black tights appeared on Saint Laurent's  AW14 catwalks

For many women, black opaque tights' enduring appeal lies with their ability to make limbs look slimmer, hide a multitude of skin sins and cleverly mask unshaved legs.

And unlike sheer ten denier tights which require careful handling, are easy to snag and can get laddered in the wash, they'll survive rough and ready handling

Debenhams added that the demand for the tights had become so great they had to constantly order more stock over Christmas to keep up with demand.

'They instantly open up your wardrobe to skirts, shorts and dresses in the winter months - minus the goosebumps, said Lisa.

'Wearing black tights means that you can be a bit braver with your outfit. The dark base is the perfect platform for bold colour or print.'
