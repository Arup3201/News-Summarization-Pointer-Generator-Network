A Florida man found the limits of one wild Key West nightspot when he was found urinating onto a waitress from a bar balcony. 

Orion Jones, 20, was arrested after a worker at Rick's, which calls itself the largest bar complex on the island, hailed a police officer to report a man 'who was urinating on a female staff member from the balcony above.'

Police confronted Jones in person at about 2:20 a.m., by which time he was fighting club security in the street.

The Smoking Gun reports that Jones tried to run, but officers finally tased him twice before handcuffing him. 

According to police, waitress Tia Cruz said she had been talking with a customer when she felt 'something wet on her body.'

At first she believed it to be rain until another employee 'pointed out Jones and said he is peeing on you.'

Jones was charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest. 

His criminal record already includes two marijuana possession convictions and arrests for burglary and trespassing. 

He is set for a Feb. 2 arraignment. 

'In speaking with Jones, Jones expressed his desire to seek help for his alcohol problem,' wrote officer Curtis Richardson in his report.
