Mother: Kate McCann said she spent years despising the person who took Madeleine in Portugal in 2007

Kate McCann has revealed she would now be able to forgive whoever abducted her missing daughter Madeleine.

The 45-year-old, of Rothley, Leicestershire, whose daughter was snatched from Praia da Luz in Portugal six years ago in May, said she spent years despising the person who took her.

But practising Catholic Mrs McCann, who is also mother to eight-year-old twins Sean and Amelie, insisted she no longer has to understand the motive behind the abduction to offer forgiveness.

She told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I think I could probably forgive Madeleine’s abductor whatever the circumstances. I don’t know whether it’s simply because I’m stronger or because there’s no benefit in not forgiving someone.

'I can’t change anything and I don’t want to be eaten up by hatred and bitterness.

'And maybe there is an element of pity - what kind of person could do something like this? Of course, forgiveness will always be easier if there is remorse.’

Mrs McCann also said she recently stopped at a petrol station and left her children in the back seat of the car, while still in view as she went to pay - the first time she had done this in six years.

She added that because there is nothing 
to suggest that Madeleine has died, the family will carry on believing 
their daughter - who was just shy of her fourth birthday when taken - is 
alive.

Mrs McCann told the Daily Telegraph that she still observes Madeleine’s birthday each year and leaves her a Christmas stocking. ‘There is part of me that has to do it,’ she said.

Madeleine’s 10th birthday is fast approaching on May 12 and Mrs McCann will be running the London Marathon on Sunday with the aim of raising £20,000 for the Missing People charity.
