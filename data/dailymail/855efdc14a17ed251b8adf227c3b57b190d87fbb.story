So full of life: Lanna Hamann, 16, was vacationing with friends in Mexico last week when she went into cardiac arrest after spending a day downing energy drinks on the beach

A 16-year-old girl vacationing in Mexico with her friends suddenly died from a heart attack over the weekend, and her mother believes that energy drinks were to blame.

Kris Hamman, of Peoria, Arizona, says her daughter Lanna, a star softball player at Sunshine Mountain High School, traveled to Rocky Point, Mexico, last week with her friends and their parents for a summer getaway.

According to Lanna's friends, the girl spent Saturday on the beach consuming energy drinks but no water.

Her mother says that night, Lanna complained to a friend's father that she was feeling ill.

A short time later, the athletic teen collapsed and went into cardiac arrest, which ultimately resulted in her death.

Mrs Hamman admitted that the same thing could have happened back home in Arizona, but she urged other parents to keep a closer eye on their kids.

‘[Watch] what they're drinking and [make sure] they're drinking water instead of an energy drink,’ Hamann told the station KPHO.

On Sunday, dozens of Lanna's friends held a vigil to remember the popular high school sophomore.

Due to complications with the girl's birth certificate, the Hamman family have been experiencing trouble bringing her body to the U.S. for burial.

The family's friends have launched an online fundraiser on GoFundMe.com to help raise the $13,000 needed to bring Lanna Hamman home from Mexico.

Those who knew the vivacious raven-haired beauty took to Twitter to raise awareness of the Hamann family's plight using the BringLannaHome hashtag.

Family friend Nicole Escobar described Lanna as a girl with a beautiful smile who loved to play softball and go on hikes.

Lanna's parents traveled across the border Tuesday to sign the 16-year-old's death certificate and accompany her body back to Arizona. 

In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration launched an investigation into five deaths linked to energy drinks and one non-fatal heart attack.

The inquest came after a Maryland family filed a wrongful death lawsuit claiming that their 14-year-old daughter died of cardiac arrhythmia caused by caffeine toxicity after downing two 24-ounce Monster Energy drinks in 24 hours.

There is no word at this time what brand of energy drinks Lanna Hamman consumed Saturday before she went into cardiac arrest.
