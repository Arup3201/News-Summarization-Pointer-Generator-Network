Miles of highway lay scattered with women's underwear on Wednesday morning after a spurned husband emptied his wife's dresser drawer after she filed a protection from abuse order against him.

Seen in singles and pairs, the assortment of personal items lead what 54-year-old James Klutch hoped would be a humiliating trail from the couple's home in North Strabane, Pennsylvania.

'It was everywhere this morning,' a local woman told KDKA.

Trail: Seen in clumps and scatterings, the under garments lead a trail from the couple's home and out onto the highway

Culprit: James Klutch was arrested on charges of simple assault and harassment after violating a protection from abuse order by his wife

'I thought someone had lost their laundry,' another man told the station.

But police say the situation was anything but funny with Klutch ultimately accused of violating a protection from abuse order filed by his wife.

Just hours after being served the order, Klutch allegedly visited his wife at their home, taking several belongings including the contents of his wife's dresser drawers.

'She returned home and found him. There was some kind of an exchange happening and she says he punched her which caused her to lose her breath,' Officer Jonathan Miles told KDKA.

After fleeing the residence, police say Klutch returned the next morning, taking more belongings from the house.

It was then after he was seen throwing her underwear along the road outside the house, the local roads, and then the highway.

Motive: After Klutch's wife filed the restraining order, he lashed out at her stealing her underwear drawer's contents hoping to embarrass her

It is though Klutch may have been intoxicated when he was throwing the underwear down the road

Officers put an alert out for Klutch who had been seen in a restaurant's parking lot 'highly intoxicated,' the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports.

He was arrested after trying to return to his wife's residence later that afternoon and jailed on $250,000 bail by late Wednesday night.

He faces charges of simple assault and harassment.

Klutch admitted during his arraignment of his attempt to humiliate his wife.
