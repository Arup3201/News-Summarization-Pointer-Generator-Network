Death plunge: Ryan Guest, 24, died after leaping off the tower in Dubai after a violent row with girlfriend Louise

A solicitor told yesterday how her boyfriend jumped from a 32nd floor balcony during a drunken row, telling her ‘I’m going’.

Louise Botham wept as she described the moments before Ryan Guest, 24, leapt 300ft, dying instantly as he landed on a roof below at their luxury beach-front apartment block in Dubai.

An inquest heard that minutes earlier, she had gathered up all the presents he had bought her, including teddy bears, and thrown them over the railings, threatening to leave him.

Mr Guest, an expatriate engineer, had then stepped out onto the balcony, climbed on a table and turned to Miss Botham, 30, to utter his last words.

The successful oil worker had been downing ‘strong cocktails’ with glasses of double rum and coke while also behaving ‘erratically’ when out with friends that evening.

She said the couple began to argue as they returned to their £400,000 home and the row continued inside, becoming violent.

Miss Botham, from Widnes, Cheshire, had jokingly thrown something at him and he angrily snatched her mobile phone.

She said she locked herself in the bathroom as Mr Guest banged on the door and attacked her as she tried to leave.

‘He pinned me down on the sofa and punched me in the arm,’ Miss Botham said. ‘I pushed him off and threw a glass at the TV in anger.

‘I said I was leaving, I hated him. He had hit me and he was never going to see me again.

‘I went into the bedroom and collected up all the presents he had given me, like teddies, and went on to the balcony and threw them all off.

He went out on to the balcony, stood on the table and said “I’m going” and then jumped. He just said “I’m going”.’

Miss Botham, who still lives and works in Dubai, said the couple had never rowed before that night in July 2008.

She believed alcohol was a ‘primary 
factor’ in Mr Guest’s death. ‘He was very impulsive and if he had been a
little bit less drunk, this would never have happened.

‘When other people are drunk they pass out or whatever but Ryan never did. He would get drunk and be totally awake.

‘I think the alcohol was a  primary 
factor. I do not think he meant to happen what happened.’ Miss Botham 
said her boyfriend was a ‘typical binge drinker’ who used alcohol as a 
‘massive stress relief’ from the pressures of work.

She had only recently flown out to live with Mr Guest, from Kendal, Cumbria, after they met in North Wales.

He worked for Dubai Petroleum and had been there only a few months after living in New York, Oslo and Latvia.

A post-mortem said he died from multiple injuries, the inquest in his home town heard.

Miss Botham was arrested by police in 
Dubai but later released without charge. Mr Guest’s tearful mother 
Frances, from Kendal, told the hearing: ‘He did not mean this to happen.

‘This was not him at all. He would not have given it much thought. We will never know what he was really thinking.’

She said her son was ‘full of life’ and moved at a fast pace, doing everything for fun.

Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner
Shirley Evans said: ‘Ryan Guest died as a result of his own actions 
while not understanding their inevitable consequences because he was 
under the influence of alcohol.’
