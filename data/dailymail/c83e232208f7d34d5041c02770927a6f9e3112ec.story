Brendan Rodgers hailed another decisive performance from Mario Balotelli at the end of his best week at Liverpool after he played a key role in enabling Adam Lallana to score the winner at Crystal Palace to take Liverpool into the FA Cup quarter final, just days after the Italian had scored a late winner himself against Tottenham.

Balotelli came on for the second half and partnered Daniel Sturridge, who opened the scoring on 49 minutes as Liverpool came from behind to beat Palace. And Balotelli then struck a fierce free kick on 58 minutes which Julian Speroni could only parry into the path of Lallana, who secured the wide.

And Rodgers said: ‘The penny has dropped. He’s training well now and starting to really work and to focus in on his job in the team.

'The other night when he came on, he got the winner and did very well and I thought today he came on and did very well. He had good strength and good power on the free quick and it was a terrific strike that forces the keeper to make the save.’

And with Sturridge scoring his second goal after five months out with injury, Rodgers can afford to be optimistic going into the final third of the season. 

‘Daniel is just working his way back. It’s just about extending his game time because you just risk re-injuring him and that’s something we can’t afford.

'You see his qualities and his spend and touch. And he doesn’t need too many chances. He looks really bright. The team’s functioning at a high level and him coming back gives us a great boost for this part of the season.’

Palace manager Alan Pardew described the cup exit as an 'opportunity missed' but felt Liverpool deserved their win.

He said: 'I felt we didn't put enough pressure on Liverpool today. We had a great chance at half-time. We should have done better today. I'm not too disappointed but I do feel it was an opportunity missed.

'But we're not going to make excuses and I think Liverpool deserved to win, and you have to accept that sometimes.'
