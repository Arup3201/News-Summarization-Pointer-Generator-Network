A new website has launched for a growing trend of singletons seeking 'part time relationships'.

Started by journalist Helen Croydon, partimelove.co.uk is designed for those who still want some intimacy and romance in their lives, but not the time commitment a normal relationship demands.

The website states it is perfect for 'singles looking for 
regular partners with mutual attraction, genuine friendship, respect and
 a magical spark but whom have no expectations of moving in after three 
months and value their free time and independence.'

The dating website is for those seeking a meaningful relationship without full-time commitment

The dating site aims to cater for those who want a real relationship - as opposed to gratuitous sexual encounters - but who only want to invest limited amounts of time to it.

Appealing to potential clientele, the website states: 'Perhaps you are just out of a long-term relationship and want to take things slow? Maybe you are a single parent, you travel three days every week or perhaps you are focused on a new career goal and don't have time for a conventional all-consuming relationship.

'That shouldn't mean you have to settle for meaningless flings. Members of parttimelove.co.uk are all like-minded single people who value their existing lifestyle but still want to spend quality time with someone they care about.'

Joining the website is free of charge and you can chose whether you are 'a man seeking a woman', or a 'woman seeking a man.'

The Part Time Love website was created by Helen Croydon who also writes about the benefits of what she calls the 'low maintenance relationship' in her latest book

And it seems thus far that the website has hit the right tone with many time-strapped singletons with beaming testimonials from the likes of 'Leah', 36 who writes: 'Wish I'd found a site like this sooner! I have found a wonderful weekend lover. He asks for no more and the times we spend together are magical.'

Another fan 'Jay, 47' says: 'I've been married and had a family before. I'm glad I did it and got the T-shirt but I don't want to do that again but I'd still love to meet a special girl to care for.'

Founder Helen Croydon also writes about the benefits of what she calls the 'low maintenance relationship' in her latest book, Screw the Fairytale, which investigates 'alternative models of relationships to conventional marriage'.

Helen is no stranger to unconventional realtionships, having in the past dated older men in return for gifts

No stranger to controversial relationships herself, Helen has written openly about her time as a member of a site that puts wealthy men (usually older) in touch with girls (usually younger) who will date them in return for gifts and an 'allowance'.

Helen, now 36, was a middle-class girl from a loving family in small-town Cheshire but six years ago, she joined dating website sugardaddie.com

She started meeting super-rich men who would pay for her company and, by her own admission; she quickly grew addicted to a glamorous life of luxury.

'I stepped into a world where money and sex, not love and respect, are the currency of a relationship.

'I went into the experience with my eyes open. I knew the man would bring money and power to the equation and he might expect sex in return, but I could make up my own mind how far I wanted to go,' Helen told the Daily Mail.

'In a sense, a normal relationship is an exchange of intimacy and emotional support for exclusivity and companionship.

'Instead, my dates compensated materially for what they couldn't offer emotionally. In that context, being paid a monthly allowance didn't seem shocking to me.'

However Helen admits that she doesnâ€™t believe that her experiences were not healthy.

'What I didn't see as I was tottering out of five-star hotels in Louboutin heels with more cash in my purse than I knew what to do with was how these experiences were warping my view of relationships,' she says.

Her new venture aims to enable those who embrace a less conventional view of romantic attachments to find each other, but both are equal partners.
