Linda and John Pruvedenti who are from Bridgwater, Somerset, send out cards, money and letters abroad to hardened criminals, including  murderers, child abusers and robbers, at America's toughest prisons

A middle-aged couple from Britain have developed a rather unusual hobby to occupy their time: writing to killers on death row.

Linda and John Pruvedenti from Bridgwater, Somerset, have spent the last six years writing to hardened criminals at some of America's toughest prisons.

The couple began writing to death row inmates in 2008, after John, 53, gave up work to look after Linda, 51, who suffers from a debilitating bowel condition called diverticulitis.

Now the former American Air Force soldier and his wife, who have been married for 31 years, dedicate their time to sending cards, money and hand-written letters to prisoners convicted of heinous crimes including murder, child abuse and robbery.

Mr Pruvedenti said: 'We are big believers in forgiveness, and we think that if people are remorseful for their crimes then they should be punished under the law but also be forgiven.

'Somehow we have always picked up the waifs and strays, and writing to death row inmates allows us to reach out to those who have gone down the wrong path in life - often through no fault of their own.

'People may think that what we do is strange, but for us it is a way to help people who need it.'

Devout Christians, Linda and John married in 1983 after a mutual friend set them up on a blind date.

They soon realised they both had a passion for helping the disadvantaged, which Linda accredits to surviving a difficult childhood.

After spotting an internet advert for death row pen pals in 2008, Linda started writing letters to American prisoners - with the full support of John.

Now the mother-of-two estimates she has built friendships with at least 10 inmates.

Ms Pruvedenti said: 'I have a natural empathy for people who have haven't had the best start in life, as I believe we all could so easily have been born into a different family and chosen an alternative path.

'I use my own experience of a difficult childhood to help others who haven't been so fortunate.

'It doesn't bother me that these people have been convicted of terrible crimes - as long as they are remorseful, they deserve forgiveness.'

One of the couple's most notorious pen pals is child-killer Lisa Ann Coleman, 38, who was executed by lethal injection in September after serving eight years on Texas death row for starving her girlfriend's son to death in July 2004.

At the time of his death, her victim, nine-year-old Devontae Williams, had more than 250 scars on his body and weighed just 35lbs.

Dressed in only bandages and a nappy, he had been beaten and bound - with police estimating he had been dead for several hours before paramedics were called to the scene.

The couple befriended Ms Ann Coleman during her time on death row and wrote to her for six years, sending Easter and Christmas cards, along with money and personal letters about their lives.

Describing her as a 'true friend' and 'loving mother', the couple say they developed a special bond with Ms Ann Coleman, whose last words were 'God bless you all'.

Linda said: 'Her letters were always lovely to read. She was so caring, and would always be asking how our children were and writing about how her own children were getting on.

'Over the years, we became close friends and I'd confide in her about my marriage and personal things that I felt perhaps I couldn't confide even in my friends back home.

'People might say that Lisa was a child-killer, but to me she was my friend.'

Linda and John hold up a selection of the letters written between them and the executed child-killer Lisa Ann Coleman, and Linda says 'it's not nice not nice to be writing to someone and then for them to suddenly be dead'

Ms Ann Coleman's letters, which were signed off with 'Always, Lisa', document her son's struggles with the law and his spells in and out of prison.

She also wrote of her hopes to appeal her sentence, and included uplifting quotes and poems, including one titled 'God's Love'.

In one letter, she writes: 'Our children need our prayers'.

In another, she expresses concern over cysts found on her ovaries.

Ms Ann Coleman also spoke of the devil, stating: 'The devil has came to steal, kill and destroy' (sic).

Shortly before her execution, Ms Ann Coleman expressed her wish to finally meet John and Linda, writing: 'I pray one day God will bless us to meet face to face'.

Lisa Ann Coleman was executed by lethal injection

They name prisoners convicted of heinous crimes including murder, child abuse and robbery as their ‘friends’, and among Linda and John Pruvedenti’s pen pals is a notorious child killer.

Lisa Ann Coleman, 38, was jailed for starving her girlfriend's son to death in July 2004.

At the time of his death, her victim, nine-year-old Devontae Williams, had more than 250 scars on his body and weighed just 35lbs.

Dressed in only bandages and a nappy, he had been beaten and bound - with police estimating he had been dead for several hours before paramedics were called to the scene.

Ms Coleman, of Arlington, Texas, was found guilty of the capital murder of little Williams,

She was executed by lethal injection in September after serving eight years on Texas death row.

Her last words were directed at her fellow inmate, Darlie Routier.

Ms Coleman said: 'Tell them I finished strong.’

She then smiled and blew kisses at the supporters at her execution, and added: 'God bless you all.'

No one showed up to represent the victim, nine-year-old Davontae.

Whilst Mr and Ms Pruvedenti believe that more people should write to death row inmates, they do admit that it has its disadvantages.

Ms Pruvedenti said: 'It's not nice to be writing to someone and then for them to suddenly be dead.

'We hadn't heard from Lisa for a while, and then I saw an article on the internet that said she had been executed - which explained why.

'It would have been lovely to meet Lisa, but unfortunately we just couldn't afford the plane tickets to Texas.

'I truly believe that if we had met in different circumstances, we would have still been friends. She was a kind, loving person and wasn't the monster that people made her out to be.

'Although what she did was wrong, and she fully deserved to be punished, I don't think she deserved to die.

'Lisa wasn't just a convicted murderer, she was our friend - and we will always keep her letters close to our hearts.'
