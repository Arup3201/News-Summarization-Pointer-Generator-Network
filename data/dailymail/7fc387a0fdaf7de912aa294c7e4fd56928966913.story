After roughly 20 minutes the site was back up.

However, within that time users were able to produce a range of parody tweets.

Denny's tweeted it's followers 'if facebook is down for you try facebooth - just come to Denny's sit in a booth and have a face to face convo with your buddies.'  

The site also suffered notable outages in early August and mid-June.

In its most recent quarter, Facebook reported revenue of $2.91 billion. 

That works out to $22,453.70 of revenue per minute.

This shows a 20-minute outage could cost the company nearly half a million dollars.

Facebook shares fell 1.1 percent, though they were lower before the outage.
