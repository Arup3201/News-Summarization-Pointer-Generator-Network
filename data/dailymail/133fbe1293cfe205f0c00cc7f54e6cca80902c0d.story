Queen Letizia of Spain enjoyed her second audience with Pope Francis in just five months as they joined forces at a health conference today.

The Spanish royal arrived in the Italian capital with her husband King Felipe on Wednesday but remained behind for the conference while he travelled home to Madrid. 

Looking absolutely stunning in a red dress, she bowed as she greeted the pontiff before she took to the stage to give an impassioned speech on malnutrition.

This is not the first time that these two have met, in fact Queen Letizia's first Royal engagement was a trip to meet Pope Francis at the Vatican in June

The royal had been invited to speak at the Second International Conference on Nutrition, by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation in whose headquarters the event was held.

She spoke to an audience of politicians and VIP representatives from 190 countries around the world on the second day of the conference.

The Pope also spoke and demanded that more be done about the distribution of the world's bounty for the poor and hungry.

He told the conference that access to food is a basic human right that shouldn't be subject to market speculation and quests for profit.  

Ahead of today's event, the Spanish royal couple had met with the Spanish Minister of Agriculture, Food and Environment, Isabel Garcia Tejerina.

Since Felipe ascended to the throne in June, the couple have visited eight different countries together - and Italy twice.

Pope Francis spoke of his belief that access to food should be a basic human right

The audience was made up of politicians and VIP representatives from 190 different countries 

Indeed, their first official foray abroad was  when they travelled to meet with Pope Francis at the Vatican.

They have since visited Portugal, France and the U.S, where Felipe addressed the United Nations' General Assembly. 

Next on their list are trips to Germany and to Mexico for the 24th IberoAmerican summit, which will be held on December 8th and 9th in the city of Veracruz.

Despite their frequent travels, the Spanish royals are known for their down to earth nature and earlier this year, they were spotted enjoying a low-key date night at a cinema in Madrid. 

Letizia even stopped to pose for a selfie with some fans who had spotted her while watching Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.

As well as her meeting with the Pope Queen Letizia was spotted speaking with Peru's First Lady Dona Nadine Heredia during the conference
