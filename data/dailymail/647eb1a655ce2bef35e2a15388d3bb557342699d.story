They’re fierce predators that rip flesh from bones using razor sharp teeth and strangle their prey, yet new video footage shows lions being as playful as household cats.

Captured by lion whisperer and zoologist Kevin Richardson, 39, in Pretoria, South Africa, the footage was filmed using GoPro camera fitted to his back.

Richardson even managed to attach the camera to the back of a lioness to give a unique viewpoint of the large cats' prowl.

While hand-held footage additionally captures amazing close-up shots of hyenas walking across the plains.

In an exclusive interview, Richardson told MailOnline he’s been working with the big cats for 16 years.

‘I’ve always been passionate about animals of all shapes and sizes. I got the opportunity to work with two male lion cubs 16 years back and was bitten by the bug.

‘I’ve been very privileged to have been accepted into the lives of many different lions over the years and and also to raise awareness to the plight of lions in the wild and their dwindling numbers.’

The lions caught on camera are 10 years old, according to Richardson. As he gets out of the car at the start of the video, Richardson shouts ‘Maggie’ and one of lions bounds towards him before leaping into his arms.

Another shot shows Richardson lying behind the lion stroking its chin and playing roughly with it.

‘If you give them a chin scratch they’re very happy, content cats. As I lie beside them I just think they’re beautiful’, explained Richardson.

A lioness is then shown hugging the whisperer before Richardson collapses in a heap with the lion and the lioness, embracing them both.

Richardson is also seen being licked by a hyena, pictured, which he claims prefer to be stroked on the neck. He added that the lowest ranking female in a pack still ranks higher than the highest ranking male

Richardson is also seen being licked by a hyena, which apparently prefer to be stroked on the neck, before explaining that the lowest ranking female in a pack still ranks higher than the highest ranking male.

The lions are then filmed chasing after and running alongside Richardson’s car and he describes the cats as 'boisterous' but admits 'he’s never been bitten'.

This close relationship meant Richardson was also able to attach the cameras to the back of the lions.

Richardson told MailOnline: ‘We filmed with a GoPro team over several days and I’ve used the [camera] with the lions so they are accustomed to posing.

‘I only put cameras on the backs of lions who I knew potentially wouldn't mind them. Some lions don't care too much, but others just want this funny little irritation off their backs!’

‘There are two vital messages that need to be conveyed to the greater mass of people out there’, said Richardson.

'The first is that lions are under tremendous threat in the wild and their numbers are not sustainable; numbers have dropped from around 300,000 to around between 15 and 25,000 in less than 70 years.

‘The second message is the sick and sinister exploitation of captive bred lions for the 'cub petting' industry and the 'canned' hunting industry, whereby lions are seen as just a commodity to enrich certain businesses. ‘

According to Richardson, cubs are farmed to be taken away from their parents and hand raised to tame them, making it possible for people to interact with them. To tackle these issues, he has set up The Kevin Richardson Wildlife Sanctuary.
