The royal baby isn't expected to arrive for another three weeks according to the officially announced due date.

But sources have suggested there could be a little boy or girl in the royal nursery much earlier than anticipated.

The Daily Telegraph reported today that 'the Duchess may be due earlier than the July 13 date announced by Buckingham Palace but have kept the true date a secret, much like Princess Diana.'

Their little secret? Could the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have announced a different due date for their first baby?

Following her lead: Princess Diana misled the press about her real due date when she had Prince William

Back in 1982, Princess Diana fooled the press by announcing the heir to the throne was due on July 1. But Prince William was actually born ten days earlier on June 21.

If Kate and William have decided to follow his mother's lead, the true expected due date of their first child will be July 3.

With the intense press speculation and public interest surrounding the birth, the couple couldn't be blamed for maintaining a shred of privacy by misleading the nation on the official due date. Especially after they lost the opportunity to keep Kate's pregnancy under wraps until she reached the three month mark after she was admitted to hospital last November with severe morning sickness.

Of course, the due date is only ever an estimation of when a baby will arrive and as palace sources have confirmed the Duchess will not be having an caesarian, nobody will be able to predict when her labour will begin naturally.

Kate's last official public engagement was the Trooping of the Colour on 15 June.

Missed nuptials: Prince William attended a wedding in Northumberland at the weekend with his brother while pregnant Kate stayed at home

The Duchess, 31, is well-aware her son or daughter could arrive even earlier than expected and so missed the wedding of her friends Thomas Van Straubenzee and Lady Melissa Percy at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland at the weekend.

Prince William, 31, attended the nuptials with his brother Prince Harry, 28, while Kate forwent the trip to the North East to instead be nearer the London hospital where she will give birth.

The Palace have said she intends to have the baby in the Lindo Wing at St Mary's, Paddington, where Diana gave birth to both William and Harry.

They also revealed that Marcus Setchell, the Queen’s former gynaecologist, will deliver the baby, aided by the Queen’s current gynaecologist Alan Farthing, the former fiance of the murdered BBC presenter Jill Dando.

As previously reported in the Daily Mail, the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child - a future heir to the throne - will be announced in exactly the same way as Prince William's to retain 'the theatre' of a genuine royal occasion.

Royal repeat: The baby will be delivered on the Lindo Wing of St Mary's hospital just as Prince William was

Theatre of notice: And just as when Prince William was born, a sign announcing the birth will be displayed in the grounds of Buckingham Palace

As soon as the baby is born, a proclamation signed by doctors who delivered the boy or girl will be rushed from the ward and displayed at the gates of Buckingham Palace within minutes.

'We wanted to retain some of the theatre of the notice. It is quite important to us that this is done properly and with the degree of dignity that the event demands. This is the birth of a child who will be in line to the throne. It is a rare occasion and it is nice to be able to do it with some historical precedence,' a Palace spokesman said.

‘It is very important [to us] that it will not be announced first on Twitter, although it will be announced on Twitter in due course.’

However, if the baby is born between 10.30pm and 8am, the news will be sent out via press release with the easel being erected later that morning, at around 9am.

Palace sources have also made clear the birth will not be made public until the Queen and senior members of the royal family have been informed  - and, of course, the Middletons, in the unlikely scenario that they are not at the hospital.
