Beer drinkers who have a sweet tooth can now get their fix in a bottle. 

Hogs Back Brewery in Tongham, Surrey, and Montezuma's Chocolate in West Sussex have combined their expertise to create the unique 4.5 per cent Chocolate Lager. 

It took six months and 'a happy accident' to create the final product and it means chocoholic beer lovers can now get both of their fixes at once. 

Hogs Brewery has teamed up with Montezuma Chocolate to create the UK's first chocolate lager 

1. Sapporo Space Barley (5.5% ABV)  features barley that was on the International Space Station. The 2009 limited edition beer was released in 250 six packs that sold for around $100 each.

2. Mamma Mia Pizza Beer (4.7% ABV) was developed in 2006 by Tom and Athena Seefurth in Illinois, America. The brew is made with tomatoes, onions and garlic.

3. Rogue Voodoo Doughnut Chocolate Peanut Butter and Banana Ale (5.3% AVB) is an artisan ale which contains essence of chocolate, banana and peanut butter. 

4. Coconut Curry Hefeweizen (8% ABV) is a cloudy yellow beer with bold coconut and curry tones. The beer is brewed with  cinnamon, coriander, fenugreek, ginger, kaffir lime, and cayenne pepper and carries a bit of heat. 

5. Oyster Stout (4.6% ABV) is a Porterhouse Brew and is said to be a balanced and smooth stout with a hint of sweetness derived from the fresh oysters which are shucked into the conditioning tank of the beer. 

Rupert Thompson, the owner of Hog's Back Brewery, said: 'We are the only people producing chocolate lager in the UK.

'We were originally intending to do an ale - we thought something dark would go best with chocolate.

'But when we tried it with a light lager it blew us away.

'The main challenge was to add the chocolate without its fat, as fat cannot be added to beer because it ruins the head.'

In the past, a dark roasted malt has been used to create a chocolate brew. Montezuma's chocolate lager does things differently, using chocolate essence extracted from Montezuma's dark Lordy Lord bar. This results in a very strong chocolate aroma. 

Beer reviewers at ratebeer.com have mixed feelings about the lager. 

A Surrey reviewer Theydon_Bois describes the lager as having  'sweet milk chocolate' nose with a 'honey, Coco Pops and chocolate malt' taste. He wrote it was 'pleasant enough' but he 'wouldn’t be rushing back for it.' 

Polarising: According to brewer owner Rupert Thompson, drinkers will either love or hate the beer 

Mr Thompson describes the beer as having 'a bit of a Marmite effect' with people either loving it or hating it.

He said: 'Some people just don't like the concept of chocolate in beer, even if they do like the taste.'

Simon Pattinson, founder of Montezuma's, said: 'As projects go, beer and chocolate is probably about as good as it gets.

'I personally like it with savoury food, like you'd have a normal beer.'

Montezuma's chocolate lager has already won a gold award at the International Beer Challenge 2014.

The beer could accompany desserts in the place of wine, or stand alone.

Mr Thompson continued: 'Chocolate puddings are notoriously difficult to complement with wines but it could work very well if this lager were added to dessert menus.' 

The £2 bottle of lager is available to buy on Montezuma’s website.
