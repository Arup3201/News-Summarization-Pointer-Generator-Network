The bodies of 13 men were today dragged from the wreckage after a five-storey building collapsed in a coastal village in Goa, India, police said.

The residential building, which was being built, caved in this afternoon as around 50 labourers worked at the site.

'We have got 13 bodies from the wreckage,' said Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar. 'We expect the death toll to rise.'

The bodies of 13 people have been dragged from the wreckage of a five-storey building, which collapsed in the village of Canacona in Goa on Saturday

Rescuers pull an injured labourer from the crumpled building. Police said seven people have been confirmed dead so far, while dozens of workers are feared trapped

Seven people have so far been confirmed dead, while dozens are feared trapped in the rubble, police said.

Authorities are trying to 
determine how many people were at the construction site when the 
structure crumpled, police superintendent Shekhar 
Prabhudessai said.

Rescue workers used cranes and bulldozers, shovels and their bare hands as they struggled to lift the concrete slabs and other debris to free the workers.

The desperate rescue attempt was witnessed by hundreds of onlookers in the seaside village of Canacona, south of Goa's capital, Panaji.

'It was like an earthquake
 when the building fell,' witness Ramesh Naik said. 'You could not see 
what exactly had happened because of the dust.'

It is understood around 50 people were working on the construction site when the building gave way

Initial reports said the building that collapsed was five stories high.

The building collapse was the latest in a string of deadly construction accidents in India, in recent months.

Fire and emergency services crews rushed to the spot and chief minister, Mr Parrikar said military reinforcement had been called in.

'We will immediately arrest the builder, the contractor and municipal officials involved in sanctioning this construction site,' he said.

'I am personally monitoring the situation.'

The bodies were moved to a morgue at a nearby hospital.

Mr Prabhudessai said the cause of the collapse has not yet been determined.
