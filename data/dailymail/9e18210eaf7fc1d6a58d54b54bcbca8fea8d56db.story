Conmen have been caught on CCTV duping drivers by asking for directions while an accomplice rifles through their victim's car and steals their cash.

The thieves have been targeting shoppers in Hampshire as they return to their cars striking more than 50 times in recent months.

The extraordinary footage shows how one of the men strikes up a conversation with an unsuspecting victim after she unlocks her car, while another man reaches into the vehicle to steal cash and cards.

A tall man in jeans and a jacket is seen waiting by an elderly woman’s car as she returns to the vehicle.

The pensioner places her handbag in the passenger seat and is walking around the back of the car to get in the driver’s side when the man starts talking to her.

With the victim distracted with her back to the silver Ford Focus, another man in a blue jacket, jeans and a baseball cap nonchalantly approaches and opens her passenger door.

He empties the woman’s bag of cash and cards just yards from where she is standing, before carefully closing the door and striding off confidently.

Hampshire Police said the conmen have struck more than 50 times in the county this year.

Their tactics range from claiming to be lost and showing their victims a map, pretending they need to go to hospital, or asking if the victim had dropped money.

A police spokesman said 55 victims had come forward in Winchester, Basingstoke, Andover, Aldershot, Fleet and Farnborough since January 1.

Crime prevention expert Graeme Barbour said: 'People who have fallen victim to this type of crime have also reported seeing people behaving suspiciously in supermarkets.

'This could be where offenders are watching shoppers entering PIN codes when paying for their shopping.'

He appealed for people to report suspicious men hanging around supermarkets and car parks to the police, adding: 'These people are knowingly preying on people’s goodwill and helpful nature and are intentionally targeting lone shoppers at supermarkets, causing a distraction which allows another member of the group to commit the theft.

'If you are approached in this way, please act cautiously. Not everyone asking for directions is a criminal, and if you choose to help it is your decision to do so.

'But before you help, please ensure your vehicle is locked and all your valuables are on your person or locked in your vehicle out of sight.'
