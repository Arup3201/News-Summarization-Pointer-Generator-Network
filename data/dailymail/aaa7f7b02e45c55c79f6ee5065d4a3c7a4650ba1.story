The ex-wife of a Russian billionaire is asking $30 million for a waterfront compound in the New York borough of Brooklyn.

Galina Anissimova, former wife of oligarch Vasily Anisimov, is selling the property which has two limestone mansions, a pool and two docks that can home a large yacht on Jamaica Bay.

The Mill Basin property has the most expensive price tag Brooklyn has ever seen, and is twice as much as anything else on the market at present.

For $30,000 the buyer will become the owner of a gated compound with a main house, guest house and outdoor pavilion with kitchen. The Noel Jeffrey-designed main house has features such as a Lalique fireplace, a circular 'meditation room' and water views from every room.

The 10-bedroom, 15-bathroom property was built in 1989 by John Rosatti, a Brooklyn car dealer with rumored mob connections.

According to Curbed, inspectors found he excavated tidal wetlands then filled them with landfill in order to extend the property.He sold the property to Anissimova in 1996 for $3.7 million before the resulting lawsuit settled and she set about renovating it.

Looking more Miami than New York, the property is all white stone and sharp edges.

According to the New York Daily News, Anissimova bought the neighboring property and tore it down, then built the Noel Jeffret-designed 8,200-square-foot guest house. Jeffrey also remodelled the main house.

Galina Anissimova's broker James Cornell of The Corcoran Group said she has probably spent more than $30 million on renovations.

'It’s perfect,' Cornell told the New York Daily News.

'It’s the highest quality everything I’ve ever seen in 24 years in the business.'

The hotel-like interior spaces are in shades of cream and beige, with marble floors and bright white shiny ceilings.Vasily Anisimov made his fortune in aluminum and iron ore then diversified into real estate development.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Anissimova is selling the Brooklyn property in the largely Russian enclave of Mill Basin because she spends most of her time in Florida - a locale the compound would look right at home in - and plans to buy a smaller apartment in Manhattan.

Galina Anissimova's daughter, Anna Anissimova, has been called 'the Russian Paris Hilton.'

Last year, she listed an apartment in Manhattan for sale for $50 million but eventually took it off the market. 

She may be able to spare her mother a room in the meantime.
