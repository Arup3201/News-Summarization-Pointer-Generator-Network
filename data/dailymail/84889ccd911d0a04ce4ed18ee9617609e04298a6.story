The FA stood up for England’s two shootout flops on Monday night by branding racist Twitter attacks on them as ‘appalling and unacceptable’.

Police have started an investigation into offensive abuse aimed at Ashley Young and Ashley Cole shortly after they failed to score from the spot in the Euro 2012 quarter-final against Italy.

The FA, in backing both players as 
Roy Hodgson’s defeated side returned home, said: 'We are concerned at 
the allegations of abuse aimed at England players Ashley Cole and Ashley
Young on Twitter.

'They have just given everything for 
the national team at Euro 2012 and it is appalling and unacceptable that
messages of an abusive type are being posted. We support any police 
investigation in identifying who is behind this.'

In a series of offensive postings one user goaded others who criticised him for his rants.

In one post the tweeter wrote: 'All I got to say is this was just a joke, you guys need to relax, police know i was kiddin around and they won’t bother me hopefully, cheers.'

Another said: 'The police won’t bother me mate I can assure you that.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said:
'We are aware of alleged racist comments on Twitter following last 
night’s England game and have launched an investigation.

'The
allegation was made to MPS on 25 June by a member of the public 
relating to comments on a Twitter account supposedly based in London.

'There have been no arrests at this early stage.

'The MPS is examining possible offences under Section 18/19 Public Order Act 1986.'
