Disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen will release a new cookbook titled Paula Deen Cuts The Fat 

Disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen has continued her recent comeback attempt with a distribution deal and a new healthy cookbook.

Paula Deen Cuts The Fat will feature 200 light recipes and low-fat updates to 50 of her 'classic' dishes. 

The announcement came just days after Deen, 68, said she would be launching a daily radio show and a weekly podcast in May.  

The new cookbook, Deen's fifteenth,is being sold and distributed by Hachette Book Group. 

Under Deen's new distribution and multi-book deal with the publisher, Hachette will also reissue Deen's previous cookbooks in print and electronic form, according to the Los Angeles Times. 

Deen, who recently lost 40lb after being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2013, told People Magazine the recipes included will preserve 'the same delicious southern taste' she is known for.  

Todd McGarity, Hachette's vice president of client distribution services, said the company was 'thrilled' to be working with Deen and her 'trademark warmth and culinary flair', which are 'appealing as ever'.

'Her large, dedicated fan base is eager for more from her,' McGarity said in a released statement. 'And we are looking forward to continuing to build on her impressive sales.'

The new cookbook will be Deen's first since she was dropped from the Food Network after she admitted in court to using racial slurs.

Deen was sued in 2012 by a former employee who claimed the then-beloved Southern chef and her brother had made racist remarks at their Savannah, Georgia restaurant.

The new cookbook will be Deen's first since she was dropped by Food Network and a previous publisher after she was sued for making racist remarks to an employer at her restaurant and admitted to using the 'N' word 

In a court deposition, she admitted to using the 'N word' and later released a video, in tears, apologizing for the incident.

'I want to learn and grow from this,' she said. 'Inappropriate and hurtful language is totally unacceptable.' 

'I've made plenty of mistakes along the way but I beg you, my children, my team, my fans, my partners, I beg for your forgiveness.' 

Deen was then dropped by the Food Network, where she was a host for 13 years, as well as Wal-Mart and Target. She also lost a book deal with Ballantine Books.
