This cheeky gorilla tries his best to wriggle free from his mother.

After a day of being carried around, he has finally had enough as he tries to escape from her arms.

The heart-warming photographs captured by Dr Michal Samuni-Blank show a doting mother and her three-week-old infant in Bronx Zoo, New York.

Dr Samuni-Blank said: 'This mother gorilla named Tuti, was carrying and holding her baby while going through her daily routine.

'She was walking, eating and washing all whilst holding her baby in her arms. Like humans, gorilla babies are totally dependent on their mothers.

'The mother will carry her baby constantly for the first four months and will continue breastfeeding throughout the first three to four years of their life. '

Dr Samuni-Blank was less than 65ft away from the Gorilla's when she captured this adorable bonding session.

The apes were making the most of the cloudy day as they roamed around their 6.5 acre enclosure.

Dr Samuni-Blank said: 'My heart missed a beat when I first saw the baby's face up-close.

'The reaction from the public has been really positive, people have been amazed and just cannot believe the cuteness!

'Western gorillas are critically endangered species threatened by habitat loss, diseases, and poaching, it's important to protect them.'

Gorilla babies are born small, at around 4.5lbs, but grow quickly.

At about six months old, a gorilla youngster can walk and ride on its mother's back. Young gorillas stay close to their mothers until they are four to six years old.
