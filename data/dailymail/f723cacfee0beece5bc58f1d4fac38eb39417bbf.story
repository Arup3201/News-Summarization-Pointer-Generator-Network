Escape: A manhunt is underway for Andrew Farndon after he was freed from a taxi as he was taken to hospital after apparently stabbing himself

Dramatic new CCTV footage has emerged revealing the incredible moment a second prisoner in a week was sprung from a taxi at gunpoint.

A manhunt is under way today after two prison officers were threatened at gunpoint and forced to release 26-year-old Andrew Farndon.

The pictures released by Suffolk police show the gunman approaching the vehicle and two men fleeing the scene outside West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmonds.

Farndon was being taken to the hospital from HMP Highpoint, a Category C prison 12 miles away, after he had apparently stabbed himself in order to carry out the plan.

It is the second time Farndon has escaped from custody, having leapt from the dock during his 2007 court case over a violent attack.

He was serving an indeterminate sentence for causing grievous bodily harm in 2007 with a minimum two-year jail term.

He was due to undergo treatment at the hospital's accident and emergency department, but instead a waiting gunman confronted the male and female guards and fled with Farndon across a car park.

A police manhunt is now under way following the incident at 6.40pm yesterday evening.

Hospital staff contacted police saying they saw the prison security officers being threatened with a gun, and the officers rang to confirm they had been ambushed.

Detective Chief Inspector Nick Bennett said armed response officers arrived on the scene within five minutes.

He said Farndon had been taken to hospital in a saloon from a local taxi firm, believed to be A1 Taxis in Bury St Edmunds. The company refused to comment.

Mr Bennett said he understood it was standard practice to transport prisoners to hospital by taxi unless there was a 'specific risk'.

He added: 'He was handcuffed to a female prison officer who removed the handcuffs when a handgun was pointed at her head. A male prison officer was also escorting him.'

Searches were continuing in Suffolk but Mr Bennett said it was unlikely Farndon was still in the county.

Forces across Britain, including the neighbouring counties of Norfolk, Essex and Cambridgeshire, along with West Midlands Police, have issued appeals for information.

Mr Bennett added: 'Along with other forces, we are pursuing various lines of inquiry, including contacting his family, friends and associates in the West Midlands.

'We are also studying CCTV and number-plate recognition records to try to identify the car which was used in the escape.

'Another line of inquiry is whether any mobile phones were used in the planning and execution of this escape.

'His prison cell has been searched and various items recovered. No blade was found in this search.

'The prison officers are still shaken and it was obviously a terrifying ordeal.'

A spokesman for Suffolk Police said: 
'Officers were contacted just after 6.50pm by staff at the Accident 
& Emergency reception of the West Suffolk Hospital at Hardwick Lane 
in Bury St Edmunds who reported they could see a man with a gun outside 
the A&E department.

'They said the man was pointing the weapon at two prison officers.

'Moments later police received a second call from the prison officers, from HMP Highpoint, who said they had a gun pulled on them by a man who had confronted them as they had arrived at A&E with a prisoner who had been stabbed in an incident at the prison.'

Farndon - whose family live in the Coventry area - is white, with a shaved head and goatee beard, and was wearing a dark blue baseball cap with a light-coloured jumper, padded on the right side due to his injury to the shoulder.

The gunman was also white, in his mid-40s, about 5ft 8ins tall and is believed to have had a Scottish accent.

The release of Farndon is the second in a week after John Anslow (pictured) was sprung from a prison van

He was wearing a white top and blue jeans and it is thought they escaped in a dark-coloured car and may have had accomplices.

Police are advising members of the public not to approach the men if they see them.

The
escape is the second in just a week, after category A prisoner John 
Anslow was sprung from a prison van after it left Hewell Prison in 
Worcestershire.

Justice minister Crispin Blunt said there was no suggestion Farndon's escape was linked to Monday's incident.

'Clearly, we will be examining the circumstances,' he said.

'The most important thing at the moment is to get this man back in custody and to investigate the full facts of the case.'

A Prison Service spokeswoman said a full Prison Service inquiry would follow.

Former convict Mark Leech, editor of the national prisoners' newspaper Converse, called for a full inquiry into how both escapes were possible.

'Forget reform, rehabilitation or reducing reoffending, the first and primary function of the Prison Service is security,' he said.

'How is it that security intelligence at these prisons missed completely both of these clearly pre-planned escapes?'

Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke has ordered an inquiry into how Anslow, described as 'extremely dangerous' by police, became the first category A prisoner to escape in more than 17 years on Monday.

Instead of being transferred in a high-security prison service van with a police escort, Anslow was with other inmates in a van run by a private contractor.

Three masked men ambushed the van, 
smashing its windows with sledgehammers and punching the driver as he 
was transporting inmates from the prison near Redditch to Stafford Crown
Court on Monday morning.

An international manhunt has been launched for Anslow with police liaising with other UK forces, the UK Border Agency and foreign authorities. The search extends to all airports and railway stations.

Anslow, also known as Skitz, has strong connections across the country, including London, as well as overseas, police said.

A 44-year-old Tipton man arrested on Monday night on suspicion of helping Anslow to escape was released on bail pending further inquiries last night, police said.
