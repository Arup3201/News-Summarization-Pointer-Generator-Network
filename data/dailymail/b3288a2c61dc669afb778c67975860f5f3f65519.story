Pimental - who was in his 60s and has served as police chief in Elmendorf for more than a year - is believed to have been kiled in the street of the small town of 1,500 people, located about 25 miles southeast of San Antonio.

Steve McCraw, head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said Pimentel is the fifth law enforcement officer to die in Texas this year.

Three of the five were killed by gunfire.

Some 13 officers died in the line of duty last year.

'Every day police officers throughout the state risk their lives to protect their communities, and tragically sometimes they make the ultimate sacrifice,' McCraw said.
