Nato airstrikes which killed 24 Pakistani soldiers went on for almost two hours and continued even after Pakistani soldiers had pleaded with forces to stop, the army claimed today.

The deaths have been described as 'tragic and unintended' by Nato who have promised a full investigation.

Afghan officials have claimed the bombing raid was triggered when a joint Afghan-Nato force received incoming fire from the direction of Pakistan.

Fury: Protesters torch an American flag as they shout slogans about the Nato airstrikes which killed 28 people

Ties between Pakistan and the United States were already deteriorating before the deadly attack and have sunk to new lows since, delivering a major setback to American hopes of enlisting Islamabad's help in negotiating an end to the 10-year-old Afghan war.

Yesterday thousands of angry Pakistanis took to the
streets and burned an effigy of President Barack Obama in 
protest over the Nato strike that killed 24 soldiers.

Demonstrators, who carried anti-Western placards and shouted slogans such as ‘death to America’, also set fire to U.S. flags.

Army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said today that the Pakistani troops at two border posts were the victims of unprovoked aggression.

He said the attack lasted almost two hours and that commanders had contacted their Nato counterparts while it was going on, and asked that 'they get this fire to cease, but somehow it continued.'

The Pakistan army has previously said its soldiers retaliated 'with all weapons available' to the attack.

The poorly defined, mountainous border has been a constant source of tension with the U.S.

Nato officials have complained that insurgents fire from across the frontier, often from positions close to Pakistani soldiers who have been accused of tolerating or supporting the militants. Nato and Afghan forces are not allowed to cross over into Pakistan in pursuit of militants.

Saturday's strikes have added to popular anger in Pakistan against the U.S.-led coalition presence in Afghanistan.

Many in the army, parliament, general population and media already believed that the U.S. and Nato are hostile to Pakistan and that the Afghan Taliban are not the enemy. By claiming it was the victim of unprovoked aggression, the Pakistan army is strengthening this narrative.

While the United States is widely disliked in Pakistan, the army has accepted billions in American aid over the last 10 years in return for its cooperation in fighting Al Qaeda.

Abbas dismissed Afghanistan's claims that the joint Afghan-Nato troops were fired upon first.

'At this point, Nato and Afghanistan are trying to wriggle out of the situation by offering excuses,' he said. "Where are their casualties?"'

John Allen, the U.S. commander of NATO 
forces in Afghanistan, yesterday issued a statement saying the incident 
had his 'highest personal attention.'

Abbas said the two military posts, named 'Volcano' and 'Golden,' were located on a ridge in Mohmand region around 300 yards from the border with Afghanistan.

He said their exact location had been provided to Nato and that the area had recently been cleared of militants.

Hours after the attack on Saturday, Pakistan closed its western border to trucks delivering supplies to Nato troops in Afghanistan and demanded that the U.S. abandon an airbase inside Pakistan used to operate drone strikes.

However, a complete breakdown in the relationship between the United States and Pakistan is considered unlikely.

Pakistan relies on billions of dollars in American aid, and the U.S. needs Pakistan to push Afghan insurgents to participate in peace talks.

After the Bin Laden raid, ties almost collapsed but slowly resumed, albeit at a lower level and with lower expectations on the American side.

A year ago, a U.S. helicopter attack killed two Pakistani soldiers posted on the Afghan-Pakistani border, prompting the army to close one of the border crossings.

A joint investigation by the two nations found that Pakistani troops had fired first at the U.S. helicopters. The investigation found that the shots were probably meant as warnings after the choppers passed into Pakistani airspace. The U.S. apologized, and the border was reopened.

Yesterday, as funerals took place for
the 24 Pakistani Army soldiers killed in the attack, hundreds of trucks
carrying supplies to U.S.troops in Afghanistan clogged the Pakistani 
border crossings.

As 
Pakistan army chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani attended the funerals 
of the victims, including a major, the U.S. sought to minimize the 
fallout from the crisis.

The attack is the worst single incident 
of its kind since Pakistan uneasily allied itself with Washington in the
days immediately following the September 11 attacks on U.S. targets.

Full probe: The President and Hillary Clinton support 'NATO's intention to investigate immediately'

Suspected militants destroyed around 
150 trucks and injured drivers and police a year ago after Pakistan 
closed one of its Afghan border crossings to NATO supplies for about ten
days in retaliation for a U.S. helicopter attack that accidentally 
killed two Pakistani soldiers.

The
situation could be more dire this time because Pakistan, outraged at 
the alleged NATO attack before dawn Saturday, has closed both its 
crossings.

Nearly 300 
trucks carrying coalition supplies are now backed up at Torkham in the 
northwest Khyber tribal area and Chaman in southwestern Baluchistan 
province. Last year, Pakistan only closed Torkham.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and 
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in a joint statement offered their 
'deepest condolences' and said they 'support fully NATO's intention to 
investigate immediately.'

U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter also met with Pakistani government officials in Islamabad.

The incident occurred a day after U.S.
General John Allen met Pakistani Army Chief of Army Staff General 
Ashfaq Pervez Kayani to discuss border control and enhanced 
cooperation.   

The
United States has long suspected Pakistan of continuing to secretly 
support Taliban militant groups in a bid to secure influence in 
Afghanistan after most NATO troops leave in 2014. Saturday's incident 
will give Pakistan the argument that NATO is now attacking it directly.
