Britain is bracing itself for a barrage of snow in the next few days with up to 8in falling in some parts, forecasters have warned.

The north-east of England and Scotland will bear the brunt of the severe weather as an icy cold snap takes hold across the country.

Bitter northerly winds of up to 60mph will leave the nation shivering and snow 4in to 8in deep north of the border is expected to fall from Thursday as the mercury drops to -4C.

Snow is also likely in Northern Ireland, parts of northern England and north Wales. The chilly conditions are expected to arrive after a few days of milder weather.

Ice-capades: Skaters at Somerset House in London today. The ice won't just be restricted to the rink next week as temperatures plunge to -9C

The Met Office has issued a gale warning for Thursday covering the northern parts of the UK, from the northern tip of East Anglia upwards, and a yellow snow warning covering Scotland into Friday.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams said Thursday and Friday nights will stay icy with a widespread frost affecting most areas and high winds.

He said: 'With the wind and the snow it will be pretty unpleasant conditions in isolated high parts so that's something to bear in mind if you are going out.'

However, he added that by Saturday temperatures will recover with low pressure moving out and a warmer air flow drifting in meaning more settled conditions.

Snow is forecast for the far north of Scotland from around lunchtime on Thursday, moving south through Thursday night.

The hills of northern Scotland could see several centimetres of snow, with up to 4cm elsewhere.

Mighty Swoosh: Comedian Noel Fielding took to the ice at the special skate session today, where skaters were invited to wear extravagant and eccentric hats in tribute to fashionista Isabella Blow, who died in 2007

There could also be snow showers affecting the east coast of England, as far south as the northern areas of Norfolk.

Temperatures will reach a maximum of 10C (50F) on Thursday with temperatures overnight on Thursday plummeting as low as minus 4C, or 25F, in Scotland.

The freezing climes will likely see off the last-remaining autumn leaves scattered around the country.

Making the most of the pre-winter golden glow, three tigers were pictured today rolling around in a pile of leaves.

The three Amur tigers at Longleat Safari
Park in Wiltshire wrestled each other to find treats which their 
keepers had hidden underneath.

Glow: As autumn comes to an end, a warm glow is cast over the Wiltshire park where the tigers look for treats

Keepers hid food under the leaves and the felines wrestled each other for it in the open woods

Ian Turner, a keeper at Longleat, said: 'The tigers love anything new to
investigate and they were soon leaping into the leaves and hunting out 
the food inside the mounds.

'The leaf litter also provided the perfect opportunity for them to practice their ambush skills.

'It's quite a sight to see fully-grown tigers leaping over piles of leaves.

'The leaves went down equally well with our troop of macaque monkeys who
wasted no time in wading into the mounds and start foraging for food.

'The meerkats were a little more wary before jumping in and joining the fun.'

Unlike
the animals native to Britain, the trio of tigers hailed from Siberia 
will have no problem with playing outside once the freezing temperatures
descend this week.

Tonight, after days of blustering 
wind, cloud is set to cover the nation and temperatures hover around 6C 
in the South, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The North East, North West and Scotland will be hit with the lowest temperatures of 3-4C.

Nativity: The set is completed by a nativity set and fake snow - ahead of the real snow coming this week

Despite some rain in the early hours of tomorrow morning, it looks set to be dry nationwide.

The fog will lift by Monday morning but return again in the evening.

After a steady few days, Thursday night will signal a drop in temperatures nationwide.

Alongside the usual Santas and snowmen, they also have bears in Christmas hats playing drums

The
South will drop from 6C in the day to 3C early evening. The North East 
will drop from around 4C to 0C and parts of Scotland will go from around
3C to -2C.

By Friday 
morning, the highest temperatures will be around 2C in Northern Ireland,
which will have a 'feels like temperature' of -1C, according to the Met
Office.

Carlisle will be as low as -2C, which feels like -9C.

The Met Office revealed Christmas looks set to be unsettled in the north and bright in the south, although it is too early to predict accurate temperatures or snow.

Parents and children were delighted as they collected their Christmas trees when they were helped by these giant shaggy dogs. The huge Newfoundland dogs were on hand for one day only

Excited: Matthew Connor, 40, brought his daughters Eleanor, eight, and Jessica, 10, to see the animals

However, that hasn't stopped people from embracing the festive spirit to celebrate the start of December.

Last night almost 1,000 people gathered outside a house in Bristol where two brothers switched on one of Britain's biggest home light displays.

Every year builders Lee and Paul Brailsford turn their mother's house in Brentry, Bristol, into a winter wonderland with tens of thousands of lights each year.

They started the tradition in 1994 and have now built up their display to £20,000 worth of lights.

For this year's event, local bands and dance acts performed to celebrate.

And in Cannock, near Birmingham, dogs were enlisted to help carry Christmas trees on sleighs as families flocked to get their own Norwegian firs.

The big shaggy dogs delighted parents and children as they darted around the Forestry Commission's Cannock Chase Forest decked in tinsel.
