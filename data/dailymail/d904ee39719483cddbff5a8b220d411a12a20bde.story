A Minnesota teen living on a U.S. military base in Japan has been arrested for raping a classmate and recording the act on a smartphone while friends watched, authorities said.

Ricky Sherwood, 18, allegedly got the 17-year-old girl intoxicated February 11 before forcing himself on her at Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa, said police. 

Witnesses said she was barely conscious during the assault. Her blood alcohol content was discovered that night at a local hospital to be 0208 per cent, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

Where it happened: Ricky Sherwood raped the teen girl on Kadena Air Force Base, in Okinawa, Japan, police said

The high school senior and part-time lifeguard at the island base was undeterred by a friend heard in the video saying ‘she looks like she’s gonna die,’ according to a criminal complaint cited by the paper.

Sherwood admitted to plying the girl with alcohol, raping her and recording a video of his actions when interviewed by investigators, the affidavit said, according to the paper.

The girl told police that went to Sherwood’s home that afternoon after school, drank two cups of alcohol and blacked out until being tended to by paramedics in a local park hours later.

Other students said the victim was ‘unable to stand, walk or dress herself,’ cops said.

Sherwood put her in a chair, carried her to a car and dumped her in the park after the rape, police said.

Investigators said the video shows the girl not moving and with her eyes closed while Sherwood raped her.

Sherwood was living on the base with his uncle, who has legal custody of him, because his mother lives in Mexico, the Star Tribune reported.

He was arraigned this week over the phone by a judge in St. Paul – U.S. officials have jurisdiction over the case because he is a base employee, the paper said.

He will eventually be extradited to the U.S. to face charges, ad faces at least one year in prison.
