Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben limped off during the 7-0 demolition of Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League last-16 second leg on Wednesday night.

Pep Guardiola allayed fears over the pair's long-term health by revealing that neither injury looked too serious.

Dutch winger Robben, Bayern's top scorer this season, clutched his thigh as he was taken off in the 19th minute while Frenchman  Ribery followed him off on the hour.

'We have to see tomorrow what the damage is but doctors said it is not too serious for them,' Guardiola told reporters.

With Bayern chasing a treble of titles and a sixth European crown they will need all the firepower they can muster despite some long-term injured players being ready to return, including captain Philipp Lahm, Thiago Alcantara and Javi Martinez.

The partnership between Robben and Ribery, nicknamed 'Robbery', is crucial for Guardiola's style of play with the pair's searing pace down the wings.

'It does not seem to be too bad,' Ribery, who scored one goal against Shakhtar, told reporters. 'It is something with the ankle and I hope I can be ready to play on the weekend.'

Bayern, who will not play again in Europe until April, are 11 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga and take on Werder Bremen on Saturday.
