The Obamas' three day trip to Ireland last June cost the taxpayer more than $7.6million, it was revealed today.

Michelle Obama spent more than $251,000 of taxpayers' money on a sightseeing jaunt to Dublin, Ireland while the first family was the official trip to Belfast, Northern Ireland.

She stayed in the $3,300-per-night 'Princess Grace' presidential suite at Dublin's tony Shelbourne Hotel, a sumptuous two-bedroom, two-bathroom lodging that measures 1,530 square feet and includes butler service and its own dining room.

President Obama an official visit to Belfast for a G-8 summit, and then to Berlin for official meetings, consuming 33.6 hours of Air Force One flight time.

According to Air Force documents published Wednesday by Judicial Watch, the president's private Boeing 747 costs $228,288 per hour to operate, bringing the flight expenses for the trip to a whopping $7.67 million.

Swanky: The Princess Grace Suite at Dublin's Shelbourne hotel goes for $3,300 per night and comes with a butler

Michelle Obama and her daughters stayed in Dublin and racked up more than $251,000 in expenses -- at hotels like the Shelbourne -- while the president was attending a G-8 meeting in Belfast

That doesn't include the cost of operating Air Force Two, which Mrs. Obama reportedly took to Dublin while the president was meeting foreign leaders in Belfast.

Judicial Watch sued the federal government in January to get the records; it's best known for litigating Freedom Of Information Act requests and publishing the resulting documents.

'It is clear that the Obamas abused the perk of the president’s official trip to the G-8 summit for a luxury European vacation at taxpayer expense,' said Tom Fitton, the organization's president.

'And it is shameful that it took a federal lawsuit to obtain this information.  Transparency goes by the wayside for the Obamas when it comes to covering up their abuse of taxpayer resources.'

The Obamas' earlier 2011 trip to Ireland cost an estimated $2.6 million, but the 2013 trip included the largest private security detail ever assembled in Northern Ireland.

Secret Service agents and members of Mrs. Obama's entourage staying in Dublin for less than two days were lodged both the Shelbourne and the Westbury hotels. 

Rooms at the Shelbourne, including the first lady's presidential suite, cost just over $55,000. Lodging at the Westbury added more than another $70,000.

Taxpayers ponied up more than $114,000 for rental cars during the brief stay, mostly for Secret Serivce details.

The White House described the first lady's side trip as an official visit, but her itinerary with her daughters read like a sightseer's dream.

While his wife and daughters toured the countryside and watched Riverdance, President Obama met with G-8 leaders before jetting to Berlin, where the rest of his family rejoined him

The Obamas' 2013 Ireland trip cost more than $7.9 million, including the first lady's Dublin sightseeing tour. Here is a breakdown of the expenses, according to Judicial Watch:

Air Force One: $7,670,476.80

'Security' in Dublin: $251,161.86, including:

'The First Lady will visit Trinity College, Ireland’s oldest university, where she will explore archives documenting the Obamas’ Irish ancestry in the Old Library and view the Book of Kells,' read the White House's media preview of the journey.

'Later in the day, Mrs. Obama will meet with the staff and families of Embassy Dublin and join Irish youth for a special performance by the Riverdance company at the historic Gaiety Theatre. Sabina Higgins, the wife of the President of Ireland Michael Higgins, and Fionnuala Kenny, the wife of the Taoiseach, will also attend.'

'On June 18th, the First Lady will visit the Wicklow Mountains National Park.'

During brief remarks to children at the Riverdance performance, she said one of her daughters described the Trinity College library as 'like Hogwarts ... It's a huge room with shelf after shelf full of books; a beautiful place, and I hope that all of you aspire to go there.'

At the beginning of the speech, she erroneously thanked her host – 'Mrs. Kennedy' – before correcting herself.

Michelle, Sasha and Malia Obama then flew from Dublin to Berlin, where they rejoined the president on the last leg of the short but expensive trip.
