A woman's body has been discovered stuffed inside a refrigerator in a Houston apartment and now police are searching for her missing infant son and the baby's father.

According to investigators, a foul odor led a maintenance worker to a second-floor unit at the Braeswood Oaks apartment complex on Fondren Road at around 2.30pm Monday.

The woman, identified late Tuesday afternoon as 27-year-old Anastacia Oakihena-Lambert, had not been seen in a week.

Shocking find: A maintenance worker found a woman's body inside a foul-smelling apartment at the Braeswood Oaks apartment complex on Fondren Road in Houston Monday 

On November 20, the city’s electrical company cut power to the unit over a late payment, but the apartment was still occupied and the family have not been facing eviction, reported the Houston Chronicle. 

Investigators are not sure at this time how long the body had been in the fridge.

According to the news station Click2Houston, which was the first to name the victim, Mrs Oakihena-Lambert was stabbed to death.

There is also no word on a possible motive behind the killing. 

Police say Oakihena-Lambert, a native of West Africa, had been living at the address on Fondren Street with her husband and baby son since June.

Mystery: The woman had not been seen in a week, and on November 20 the electrical company turned off the power at the unit over a delayed payment 

Writing on a social media page earlier this year, Mrs Oakihena-Lambert described herself as a computer programmer who had recently moved from Hawaii to Houston. 

'Married and blessed with a beautiful son,' the 27-year-old wrote. 

Detectives have now named the woman's missing spouse, 38-year-old Patrick Lambert, a person of interest in connection to the death.

They have also issued an Amber Alert for her 11-month-old son, Achilles Lambert, who is believed to be with his father. They say the toddler, who turns one next month, may be in danger.

Mr Lambert has been described as a black male standing at 5 feet 11 inches. The father and son have not been seen or heard from in a week, and police have not been able to reach any other family members.

Anyone with information on Patrick Lambert’s whereabouts is being asked to call police at 713-308-3600.
