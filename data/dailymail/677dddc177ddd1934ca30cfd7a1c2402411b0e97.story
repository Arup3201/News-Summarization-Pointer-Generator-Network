This crafty kitty has been driving his owners round the bend with his night-time antics and has been labelled a cat burglar. 

Mufasa, who is 11-months-old and looks all sweet and innocent, but has been sneaking out of his owners' home in Ipswich near Brisbane, Queensland through an old style louvre window in the laundry room.

Over the past few weeks he has returned home from his night-time travels with a stash of stuffed toys including a monkey, giraffe, dog and two teddy bears. 

Cheeky Mufasa has built up quite a haul of cuddly toys in the last three weeks in his night-time adventures

These are three of the five toys Mufasa has dragged home in the last few weeks- have you seen them before?

Mufasa is quite unaware of how famous he has become and is taking each day pretty easy

Mufasa's owners the Skinner family have set up a Facebook page in a desperate attempt to try and find out who the toys belong to. 

Mother-of-five Sharna Skinner, 33, told Daily Mail Australia: 'Three weeks ago he brought home a stuffed monkey and it was just left under the dining table. 

'I thought my husband had left it under there because my daughter likes monkeys but it turned out that it wasn't him. 

Just a year ago Mufasa was very cute and innocent, the family had no idea what he would become

The curious kitty has been putting his nose in lots of places and has developed a fetish for cuddly toys 

'Then a few more toys have just randomly turned up over the past few weeks. 

'Mufasa was getting out through a window which we had no idea he could even fit through and we think he was coming back through our on-suite.'

Mufasa belongs to Mrs Skinner's 11-year-old son Malachi who has been out door-knocking his neighbours with the family trying to find out who the toys belong to.

Look at those eyes: Mufasa looked like butter wouldn't melt when he was a kitten

Mrs Skinner added: 'Our neighbours thought we were crazy when we started asking if the toys belonged to them, Malachi has been finding it quite amusing and funny. 

'We think they are probably from the same place but they could be from different places, we reckon they are from gardens or balconies. 

'It’s a bit of an embarrassing thing to get famous for, our cat stealing toys was not what we expected.' 

Mrs Skinner set up Facebook group called 'Help - my cat is a kleptomaniac' and wants people to spread the word so the can get the toys returned.

'One of the toys was so big he had to drag it home, we just want to find out who owns the toys and give them back'.
