It's hardly your average drive in the country and just watching footage of Peter Taylor racing around Mull is enough to make you feel car sick.

The young rally driver broke the all time record on a stage around the island during its annual road race.

Taylor, 22, made it road an 8.3 mile stretch of the picturesque island off the west coast of Scotland in just six minutes and 42 seconds.

Despite being faced with the challenge of a series of hair raising bends and even a new chicane on the island's narrow single track road, Taylor and his co-driver flew around the course, winning richly deserved praise from rally fans.

One fan who viewed the record breaking lap on YouTube described it as 'stunning'.

Martin Curtis added: 'It's why these boys get my respect above circuit drivers.'

But the rest of the Cumbrian driver's race wasn't quite as successful despite his brilliant white knuckle ride.

Bad luck: The 22-year-old driver didn't perform quite as well in the rest of the race - he lost out on winning the rally overall

Losing time: Taylor suffered a series of unfortunate bumps during the rest of the race - one of which saw him lose his bumper

He missed out on winning the overall rally, after a series of unfortunate mistakes left his Ford Focus rather battered by the end of the race.

He lost time because of a series of minor bumps one of which saw him lose the bumper of his car.

The rally was eventually won by John MacCrone in his M-Sport prepared Ford Fiesta 82400.

The Tunnock's Mull Rally was the first and remains one of only two rallies in the UK that is permitted to close roads in order for it to take place.

The idea for the race was conceived by Brian Molyneux after he went on a family holiday to the island.

The first race took place there in 1969.
