Battle: Dee appeared on ITV's This Morning to try and raise awareness of depression

Benefits Street star White Dee has spoken out about her battle with crippling depression.

Dee - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly - appeared on ITV's This Morning to try and raise awareness of the condition.

At the height of her depression - triggered by the death of her mother in 2011-  she says she felt permanently numb and cried for 24 hours a day.

'There was just a big gaping hole in my life and I was too scared to leave the house,' she told presenters Holly Willoughby and Christine Bleakley and Dr Chris Steele, the resident GP.

Dee, the undisputed star of Channel 4’s controversial
 documentary series, is seen as the famous matriarch 
of James Turner Street in Birmingham.

But she says her depression left her a prisoner in her own home and it was only because a friend took her to the GP that she is now on medication.

She explained: 'When my mum passed away it left a real hole in the family. I used to speak to her 10-15 times a day and see her nearly every day.'

She said she initially coped with her grief by trying to care for her father.

'I went into overdrive. I am the elder sibling so I started obsessing over Dad. We have a real old-school Irish family - Dad worked, Mum did all the cooking.

'I sort of jumped in, thinking he was useless - but he wasn't. I was trying to protect him, but in the end, he had to say "back off, stop ringing me 10 times a day".

'Once I realised Dad was OK, there was nothing to do. There was just a big gaping hole.

'I was locked away in the house, too scared to leave and Mum wasn't coming back.'

Dee said she then began lying to friends about where she was, to prevent her reclusiveness from being discovered.

'Then one day after four or five months, a friend clocked it and took me off to the doctor to get me the help I needed,' she recalled.

She admitted that because of the taboo surrounding depression, she probably wouldn't have sought help had a friend not taken her to the GP.

PSYCHOLOGICAL symptoms of depression include:

Continuous
 low mood or sadness, feeling hopeless and tearful, being irritable and 
intolerant of others, not getting any enjoyment out of life and having 
suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm.

PHYSICAL symptoms include:

A
 change in appetite or weight, disturbed sleep - especially finding it 
hard to fall asleep at night or waking early in the morning - loss of 
libido and a lack of energy.

Today, Dee takes the antidepressant Sertraline and is under the care of her local mental health team.

'The only thing I don't do any more is cry 24 hours a day,' she added.'You start taking antidepressants and you stop crying, but just feel numb, permanently numb.'

She admitted that she sometimes also feels suicidal.

When quizzed about her matriarchal role and the fact that on the show she always seems to be helping others, she replied: 'We were filmed every day for 18 months - there might have been a week when someone else was looking after the kids because I couldn't do anything and couldn't move.

'Some people have said to me: "you don't look depressed".

'People throw the word around and say after a bad day "oh I'm so depressed" - but it kind of feels personal [and strange to have it used like that]. 

'I let it go over my head - I have to concentrate on myself.'

And despite depression
 being the most common mental health issue - affecting nearly a fifth of
 adults and 80,00 children and young people - depression is still 
one of society's taboos, resident GP Dr Chris Steele explained.

Unknown: Dee admitted to presenters Holly Willoughby and Christine Bleakley that people have said: 'You don't look depressed'

'Telling someone they don't look depressed is a ridiculous way to assess someone,' he said. 

'I have had severe depression three times - I remember once sitting crying in the toilets before going on air to do a live phone-in - on depression. It was a nightmare.

'You can't just "pull yourself together" - you need help, so see a doctor. You will get better if you take treatment and medical advice.'
