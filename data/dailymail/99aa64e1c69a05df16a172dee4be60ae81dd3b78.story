The strike on ISIS today came after 
U.S. forces spent the last two months moving ships, jets and troops 
within striking distance.

After
 President Obama gave the go ahead last night, two F/A18 fighters flew 
off from an American 'supercarrier' in the Persian Gulf to fire 500lb 
laser-guided bombs on a group of Islamic militants outside Kurdish 
capital Erbil.

The jets were
 on the USS George H.W. Bush, which was ordered to travel 1,000 miles 
from the Arabian Sea to the Persian Gulf seven weeks ago.

Surrounded: The U.S. has spent recent months moving its ships, jets and troops within striking distance with today's attack on ISIS coming from the Persian Gulf

It begins: One of the two F/A-18C Hornet fighter jets that bombed the ISIS artillery position prepares for takeoff from the USS George H. W. Bush in the Persian Gulf before the dawn mission this morning

Ready for action: And as soon as the first two jets returned from their successful bombing run on ISIS fighters marching on Erbil this morning, the flight deck of the George H. W. Bush aircraft carrier came alive as more warplanes readied for action

It
 joined the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet - two aircraft carriers -  the USS 
Carl Vinson and USS Abraham Lincoln - and several nuclear submarines 
armed with Tomahawk missiles.

Each
 carrier typically carries 64 aircraft, including the F/A-18 Super 
Hornet fighter jets, EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare aircraft, E-2 
Hawkeye surveillance planes and SH-60/MH-60 Seahawk helicopters.

There are also five other U.S. ships believed to be in the Arabian Sea of needed.

Obama's operational choices are limited to launches from bases outside Iraq's borders.

Among
 them are Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which already houses command and 
logistics hubs for U.S. Central Command and was ground zero for air 
sorties over Afghanistan and Iraq since the early days of the George W. 
Bush administration.

Al-Udeid is still used for some air missions over Afghanistan and houses long-range B1-bombers.

Closer
 to Iraq's northern provinces is an American air base in Incirlik, 
Turkey. After 2011, that facility inherited much of the airborne 
surveillance hardware – including drones – that the U.S. once launched 
from bases inside Iraq.

'We're coming to help': President Obama meets with the National Security Council yesterday in the Situation Room of the White House, hours before his address to the nation in which he vowed to help the thousands of Iraqi civilians being driven from their homes and slaughtered by the Islamic State extremists running rampant through the country. That help came in the form of targeted airstrikes on key ISIS positions today

Unmanned attacker: The United States has its MQ-9 'Reaper' drones that can deliver Hellfire missiles more than 1,100 miles away

Gone in a cloud of smoke: A dust cloud rises where the first US bomb struck ISIS artillery being towed by a truck outside Irbil

The airstrike marked the first time US forces have taken direct action against ISIS since it began taking control of huge swathes of the Middle East

In
 addition, the U.S. commands a detachment of F-16 fighters in Jordan, 
where it has 2,000 troops based, according to a Pentagon official.

The
 superpower also has a massive arsenal of MQ-18 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper
 drones, capable of delivering Hellfire missiles more than 1,100 miles 
away.

The Reaper drones can also deliver 500-pound bombs.

The United States has around 800 personnel on the ground in Iraq - but not enough to launch an attack.

In
 late June it was announced that the U.S. was sending another 300 troops
 to Iraq to beef up security at its embassy and around Baghdad.

Response: On the ground, a Kurdish armoured vehicle rushes towards the site of the U.S. air strike to meet ISIS

Rolling tanks: Peshmerga fighters are pictured yesterday patrolling their territory in an operation against the ISIS fighters

It does have 10,000 troops in Kuwait and stores millions of rounds of small arms fire, 
thousands of rounds of tank ammunition, helicopter-fired rockets, 
machine guns, grenades, flares, sniper rifles, M16s and M4 rifles.

Britain has a RAF base in Cyprus, less than 100 miles from from Syria and 650 miles from Baghdad.

RAF Akrotiri was built in the mid 1950s and first used in the Suez crisis.

More recently the base was used as a supply post during the Iraq wars and also used to support the attacks on Libya in 2011.

Before intervention in Syria was voted down by the Commons, this is where the strikes would have come from.

Now it could be used for air drops to the Yazidi tribe who are trapped in the mountains of Iraq or the British could share American bases.
