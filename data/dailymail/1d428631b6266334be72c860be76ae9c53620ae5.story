London Broncos have released two of their overseas close-season signings, just five weeks into their Kingstone Press Championship campaign.

The Broncos say 31-year-old prop Josh Cordoba, who had a brief spell in Super League with Hull in 2009, has left the club with immediate effect after they agreed to his request to be released from his contract.

And London have announced that former Salford half-back Liam Foran, the 26-year-old brother of New Zealand international Kieran, has also left the club by mutual consent as he was keen to move back to Australia with his partner.

'It was agreed by both parties that this was the best decision for the club moving forward,' said a Broncos spokesman.

'Interim head coach Andrew Henderson is currently looking at the transfer market to bring in the best replacements for these players to add to the existing squad.

'The club will make no further comment on either player.'

The Londoners have won just two of their opening five matches since relegation from Super League and were hit last month by the departure of coach Joey Grima, who was granted a release for personal reasons in order to take his family back to Australia.
