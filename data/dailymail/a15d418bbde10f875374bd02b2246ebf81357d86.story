Pressure: Thrown off guard by a heckler in Edinburgh who accused him of slashing benefits, Mr Duncan Smith said last week the 'reality is this country is not cutting welfare'

David Cameron's austerity programme’ was under pressure last night as a fierce war of words broke out over major welfare curbs and tax cuts for the well-off that take effect over the next week.

The Labour and Tory feuding came after Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith blurted out that he had given up trying to cut the benefits bill.

He said he is simply ‘managing’ the ever-rising increase in handouts – and was forced to deny his new ‘universal’ benefit is in turmoil.

His comments were in stark contrast to remarks by his own Minister for the Disabled, Esther McVey, who told The Mail on Sunday she is determined to stop widespread abuse of the £13 billion-a-year disability benefit claimed by three million.

And Ed Miliband came under fire over a highly-provocative leaflet attacking the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p from April 6. The Labour leaflet, designed to look like a lottery flyer, states: ‘£100,000 win for everyone earning £1 million.’

In fact, people who earn £1 million, will be £42,500 better off per year.

A Tory official said: ‘Labour’s claim is a lie and the crude politics of envy. Cutting the top rate means more people work hard and pay more in tax overall, so the Government has more money, not less, to spend on services.’

The clashes mark long-awaited changes in taxes and benefits that start tomorrow.

They include the so-called ‘bedroom 
tax’, a cut in benefits to people in under-occupied homes; the so-called
 ‘granny tax’, abolishing special tax breaks for over 65s; new checks to
 stop 500,000 people claiming up to £120 a week in Disability Living 
Allowance and a one per cent cap on benefit rises.

Thrown off his guard by a heckler in 
Edinburgh who accused him of slashing benefits, Mr Duncan Smith said 
last week the ‘reality is this country is not cutting welfare . . . all 
those on cash benefits will still see cash increases in every year of 
this Parliament’.

Mr Duncan’s Smith’s indiscreet 
comments exposed his private fury that his ‘war on welfare’ has been 
vetoed by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. But it makes a mockery of repeated claims by Mr Cameron and Mr Duncan Smith himself that they want to cut welfare.

Privately, Mr Duncan Smith is still 
seething that three big welfare cuts put forward by him – freezing 
welfare benefits, scrapping housing benefit for under 25s and axeing 
additional handouts for people on benefits with two children who have a 
third – were all ruled out by the Lib Dems.

They would have saved £10 billion a year.

A Tory source said: ‘Mr Duncan Smith 
would dearly like to go much go further in reducing welfare, but he 
can’t because of the Lib Dems.

'All he has done is admit the truth: because of the Lib Dems, the welfare bill will carry on rising under the Coalition.

'He is frustrated by it as all the evidence is the public supports him.’

The source denied Mr Duncan Smith was
 trying to play down the looming welfare benefits crackdown because 
claimants are about to realise their handouts have been cut – or 
stopped.

There was no reference in Mr Clegg’s 
Easter message to benefit cuts. Minister for the Disabled Ms McVey told 
The Mail on Sunday of her determination to force through controversial 
reforms to the Disability Living Allowance.

From April 8, the benefit is to be 
renamed Personal Independence Payments, and claimants will be subjected 
to regular face-to-face checks.

The word ‘disability’ has been 
dropped from the name of the handout as Ministers say it is falsely 
claimed by large numbers of people who are temporarily incapacitated and
 still claim it when well.

To back up the case for reform, 
Ministers highlighted new official figures showing that, since 2008, 
nearly 900,000 people dropped their incapacity benefit claims rather 
than undergo a tough medical test.

The figure amounted to more than a third of the total number of people claiming sickness-related benefits.

Ms McVey is determined to weed out 
another 500,000 people suspected of making – and winning – claims for 
DLA, many of which are paid for life on the basis of form filling.
