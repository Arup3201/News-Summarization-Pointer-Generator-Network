Philippe Coutinho's (centre) stunning first-half goal set Liverpool on the road to victory against Southampton

SOUTHAMPTON

Fraser Forster 6 - No chance with with either goal and, in truth, had very little to do other than pick the ball out of the net.

Nathaniel Clyne 7.5 - Just seems to get better every week. Has to England's right-back for March internationals.

Maya Yoshida 6.5 - Solid enough display from the Saints centre-back. Did everything required of him.

Southampton right-back Nathaniel Clyne seems to get better every week... he did everything he could

Jose Fonte 7 - Southampton's leader led from the front. What you see is what you get with the Portuguese.

Matt Targett 6.5 - Coped well with Adam Lallana's threat but slipped, vitally, for Sterling goal. All in all, a composed display.

Steven Davis 6 - Kept things ticking over in the midfield without being spectacular. Subbed at half-time.

Victor Wanyama 6 - The midfield powerhouse imposed himself in the engine room but couldn't unlock Liverpool.

James Ward-Prowse 6 - Quiet afternoon for the Saints youngster in midfield and was subbed early in the second half.

Filip Djuricic 6 - Could easily have won a first minute spot kick but was wasteful in possession at times.

Eljero Elia 6 - His pace caused Liverpool problems down the left, but missed a glorious chance after Liverpool took the lead.

Graziano Pelle 6.5 - The Italian was a real handful for all three of Liverpool's centre-backs but had few opportunities.

Subs

Sadio Mane 6 (for Ward-Prowse 57) - Injected pace into Saints attack.

Morgan Schneiderlin 6 (for Davis, 46) - Misplaced pass led to Sterling's goal.

Dusan Tadic 6 (for Djuricic, 75) - Came on with the game dead and buried.

LIVERPOOL

Simon Mignolet 7 - Still not back to his best, but looks like he is over his problems from earlier this season.

Dejan Lovren 6 - Awful first-half, but improved in the second. Still looks way short of being a £20million player.

Martin Skrtel 7.5 - Still looked prone to lapses in concentration but the pick of Liverpool's defenders.

Emre Can 7 - Lucky not to concede an early penalty but recovered to see Liverpool home in difficult conditions.

Jordon Ibe 7 - What a decision by Rodgers to recall the youngster from his Derby loan. Looks a tremendous prospect.

Jordan Henderson 8 - The heir to Steven Gerrard's midfield dynamo role. Another mature display from the England international.

Jordan Henderson was fantastic for Liverpool, and is the heir to Steven Gerrard's midfield throne

Joe Allen 7.5 - Kept the ball moving in a congested midfield. Effective without being mind-blowing in the engine room.

Lazar Markovic 5.5 - Struggled to make an impact in the first-half and was hooked by Rodgers at half-time.

Adam Lallana 6.5 - Worked hard on his return to St Mary's but was well-shackled by the Saints defence. Subbed.

Philippe Coutinho 7.5 - An outstanding moment of quality from the diminutive Brazilian put Liverpool on the road to victory.

Raheem Sterling 7 - Back in the starting XI after a foot injury. Had to work off scraps - that's all he needs. One chance, one goal.

Subs

Alberto Moreno 6.5 (for Markovic 46) - Slotted seamlessly into Liverpool's left-sided role.

Maya Yoshida puts in a tackle on Raheem Sterling, who had one chance to score... and took it

Daniel Sturridge 6.5 (for Lallana 63) - Oozed quality as soon as he came on.

Glen Johnson 6 (for Ibe 75) - Sured things up for the final minutes. 

Referee - Kevin Friend 5.5 - A figure of controversy at St Mary's. A roller-coaster afternoon for the official.
