A shipwrecked crew have been rescued after becoming stranded in shark-riddled waters during the round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race.

The nine-men Team Vestas crew crashed on a remote coral reef before they were picked up and taken to Mauritius.

Shore crew chief Neil Cox told the BBC: 'We've had nine guys sitting on a sand spit in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The coastguard was asking me to warn the guys that the reef is riddled full of sharks and barracuda.'

The fleet of seven vessels were making their way from Cape Town to Abu Dhabi - the second stage of the nine-leg race - and expected to reach the United Arab Emirates on December 13.

Team Vestas captain Chris Nicholson said they would attempt to rescue their damaged craft before rejoining the race for the start of the fourth stage starting in in Sanya, China, in February 2015.  

Nicholson said: 'I'm really disappointed. On the other hand, we have to realise how fortunate we are.

'It's clear that human error is responsible for the shipwreck, there's no avoiding that. And as skipper, I take ultimate responsibility.

Nicholson is still hoping the damaged boat can be retrieved and repaired to join the race at a later stage

'The past four days have been very challenging for all of us, and I am extremely proud of the whole crew's professionalism, composure, and endurance.'

After crashing on Saturday, the crew were forced to wade through knee deep water before finding a dray location to wait for their rescuers on Sunday morning.

They were taken by a coastguard boat to a small deserted islet called Ile du Sud, popular with shark-watching day-tourists, before completing their journey on a weekly fishing vessel.
