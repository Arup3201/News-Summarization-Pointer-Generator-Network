Wildlife presenter and comedian Bill Oddie has called for TV star Rolf Harris to be left alone because all he did was have a 'morning cuddle with his secretary'.

Mr Oddie, 71, expressed his sadness at detectives questioning Harris over historic allegations of sexual offences because the Australian star has endured a tough time with his wife Alwen having been ill.

He said: 'Leave him alone. He's a jolly bloke, he would want his morning cuddle from the secretary and she'd be only too happy to give it him.

'It wasn't molestation or anything like that.'

Talking in an interview on Australian television, Mr Oddie said that Jimmy Savile came across as a 'weirdo' in the 1970s but that his impression of Rolf Harris was very different.

There is no suggestion that any of Mr Harris's former secretaries have made a complaint against him.

Harris is currently on bail.

According to The Daily Mirror, he added that he believes BBC bosses at the time must have known that Savile was preying on young girls.

Former Springwatch presenter Oddie said that if they didn't know they weren't doing their job properly.

Mr Oddie made the comments while promoting his current tour of Australia with his one man show An Oldie But a Goodie.

The show sees Oddie regale audiences with tales of his time as a Goodie with Graeme Garden and Tim Brooke-Taylor in the 1970s and 1980s.

Mr Oddie left his role as a presenter on BBC wildlife programme Springwatch in 2009.

Despite reports that he had left due to ill health, he claimed that he had been frozen out by producers after a complaint was made against him about a mystery incident which happened during filming on Dorset's Brownsea Island.

The presenter spoke of his shock when BBC producers called him in to tell him that he would not be asked to return for the next series of the popular show.

He said in an interview last year: 'In January, I was called in, and was told, "We wonâ€™t be asking you to do Springwatch next year". So that was the big shock. No one explained why.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
