U.S. Congress has frozen $700million in aid to Pakistan until it gives assurances it is combating the spread of homemade explosives in the region.

Calls are growing in the U.S. to penalise Pakistan for failing to act against militant groups and, some argue, helping them.

Relations between the two countries are already at rock bottom after a number of U.S. drone attacks have killed Pakistani civilians and the secret raid in which al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in May.

Scourge: U.S. Army soldiers secure a road after an IED exploded during a patrol in Logar, Afghanistan. Fertiliser used in making the explosives is being smuggled from Pakistan

Pakistan is one of the largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid and the cutback announced is only a small proportion of the billions in civil and military assistance it gets every year.

Salim Saifullah, chairman of Pakistan's Senate foreign relations committee, warned ties could worsen further after the decision.

He said: 'I don't think this is a wise move. It could hurt ties.

'There should instead be efforts to increase cooperation. I don't see any good coming out of this.'

Militancy: Fuel trucks burn in Bolan, Pakistan, after an insurgent attack. The U.S. has suspended $700million in aid until Pakistan can give assurances on the spread of IEDs

Deteriorating ties: A man burns a U.S. flag with a picture of President Barack Obama on it in Peshawar, Pakistan. Relations between the two countries have hit rock bottom

Suspicions: Senator John McCain has said fertiliser used in many of the IEDs targeting coalition troops in Afghanistan originates from two factories in Pakistan

Homemade bombs, or improvised 
explosive devices (IEDs), are among militants' most effective weapons 
against U.S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan as they struggle to 
fight a resurgent Taliban insurgency.

Many are made using ammonium nitrate, a common fertiliser smuggled across the border from Pakistan.

The U.S. wants 'assurances that Pakistan is countering improvised explosive devices in their country that are targeting our coalition forces', Howard McKeon, a House Republican, said.

Some $20billion of security and economic aid has been allocated to Pakistan by the U.S. since the start of the war in Afghanistan in 2001 - much of it in the form of reimbursements for assistance in fighting militants.

But U.S politicians have expressed increasing frustration with Pakistan's efforts in the war.

There
have been proposals to make U.S. aid to Pakistan conditional on more 
cooperation in fighting militants such as the al Qaeda-linked Haqqani 
network, which Washington believes operates out of Pakistan.

Cause for complaint? As the U.S. stepped up its attacks on Taliban insurgents, the numbers of civilian deaths have increased in Pakistan, particularly after strikes by drones

2001 - Pakistan becomes an ally in the war against terror after the September 11 attacks

2009 - U.S. launches strategy to destroy al Qaeda holdouts in Pakistan and prevent insurgents crossing the border into Afghanistan. Pakistan also launches military offensive targeting militants in Waziristan. U.S. Congress agrees $7.5billion five-year aid programme to strengthen civilian and military ties with Pakistan

2010 - Number of Predator drone strikes in border region is greatly increased, but attacks kill civilians which sparks bad feeling against the U.S

January, 2011 - CIA contractor Raymond Davis arrested for killing two men in Lahore. U.S. calls for him to be released amid massive protests in Pakistan. He is freed in March after $2.3million in 'blood money' is paid to victims' families

May, 2011 - Secret Navy Seal raid in Abottabad succeeds in killing al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Pakistan is furious is was not consulted, but U.S. accuses intelligence service ISI of holding back information

July, 2011 - U.S. delays $800million in military aid over failures in security cooperation

September, 2011 - Admiral Mike Mullen accuses Pakistan of supporting insurgent groups, including al-Qaeda-linked Haqqani network. Pakistan strongly denies the comments

December, 2011 - U.S. Congress freezes $700million in aid over Pakistan's failure to prevent spread of homemade explosives into Afghanistan

Pakistan
says it is doing all it can to fight al Qaeda and the Taliban and has 
lost thousands of soldiers since it joined the U.S. led war 10 years 
ago, some at the hands of coalition troops.

Islamabad has accused NATO of 
deliberately killing 24 Pakistani soldiers in an air strike near the 
Afghan border last month and shut down supplies for foreign troops in 
anger.

Former general and security analyst 
Talat Masood said: 'I think the Pakistan side will understand the type 
of signal that is coming, which shows it's not only a question of aid.

'The
whole attitude of the U.S. and the relationship will be affected by 
these measures because they know Pakistan will not be in a position to 
control smuggling.'

Republican Senator John McCain said 
last week: 'The vast majority of the material used to make IEDs used 
against U.S. forces in Afghanistan originates from two fertiliser 
factories inside Pakistan.'

A Congressional Research Service 
report in October said the Pakistani factories, owned by one of the 
country's biggest companies, Pakarab, have been producing over 300,000 
metric tonnes of ammonium nitrate per year since 2004.

The
U.S. has urged Pakistan to strictly regulate the distribution of 
ammonium nitrate to Afghanistan. So far, Pakistan has only produced 
draft legislation on the issue.

Analysts say U.S. demands will be tough to meet because of rampant corruption on both sides of the porous border that makes smuggling easy.

One businessman explained how easy it is to get through security.

"We pay a 1,200-rupee ($13) bribe to the Pakistani Frontiers Corps on the border for every car carrying fertiliser," said Kamal Khan in the border town of Chaman.

"Fertiliser is smuggled on trucks, pickup trucks, motorcycles, bicycles and donkey carts.'

Pakistan's fragile economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, so cutting down on fertiliser output would hurt the sector.

The provision freezing $700 million in aid was agreed upon by leaders of the armed services committees from both parties in the House and Senate, including Mr McCain.

It is part of compromise legislation authorising U.S. defence programmes expected to be approved this week, Mr McKeon said.

The bill would also require the Pentagon to deliver a strategy for improving the effectiveness of U.S. aid to Pakistan, he said.
