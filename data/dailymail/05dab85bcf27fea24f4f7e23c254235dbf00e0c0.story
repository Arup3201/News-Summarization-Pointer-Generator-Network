A unique home that looks like it would be the perfect place for Bilbo Baggins to live in has gone on the market for a whopping $1.2 million.

The mushroom shaped house could be the Lord of the Rings' character’s humble Hobbit hole, but it probably costs a lot more.

The four bedroom property is located in Bethesda, Maryland and judging from its bizarre exterior would not look out of place in Middle Earth.

Fit for a hobbit: This bizarre home looks fit for  Hobbit Bilbo Baggins and has gone on the market for $1.2 million in Maryland

Living room: The owners of the hobbit house, Edward and Frances Garfinkle, bought the property in 1967,  and added quirky touches to it

Exterior: the overall design was crafted by an architect who built the current home around the existing one back in the early 1970s

The 3,600-square-foot home was initially built in 1923. 

It has 2 full baths and one half bath and boasts 30-foot tall ceilings, an indoor fish pond, exposed wood beams, cave-like nooks, recycled barn-wood floors and skylights galore.

The owners of the hobbit house, Edward and Frances Garfinkle, bought the property in 1967 and turned it into the quirky home it is today, adding high ceilings, exposed wood beams and skylights.

It was crafted by an architect who built the current home around the existing one back in the early 1970s and included the couple's ideas in the design. 

Garfinkle said he worked with an architect that was into futuristic design at the time and used a spray-on material, polyurethane, that is also eco-friendly. 

The owner, an artist, told local news outlet WUSA9: 'At the time we were looking for something different. We did not want to be in a box.'

But the project nearly left the ambitious couple bankrupt because it cost them $100,000 to $150,000 to create it.

'We were kind of misled into thinking it was an inexpensive way to build. It didn’t turn out that way. ... We did this when we were young. Looking back on it, it was probably kind of dumb,' Garfinkle told Bethesda Magazine.

Mod cons: The house has a host of beautiful rooms including this one which has a sink and dish washer in it

Bedroom: This simple bedroom is just one of four which are located in the property in Bethesda, Maryland

Bathroom: The home features this pretty bathroom which has a shower and two double sinks in it 

Interior: The house boasts 30-foot tall ceilings,  exposed wood beams, cave-like nooks, recycled barn-wood floors and skylights galore.

'A lot of people have wanted to see the interior. ... [Someone] would knock on the door, and they'd say, 'Can I come in?' And we'd say, 'No.' And they'd say, 'Why?' And we'd say, 'It's our home, we live here.' ... But, you know, it's been fun.'

The family describe the entire home as their personal work of art.

And now that their children have grown up and have moved out Garfinkle said that it's too much space for him and his wife, which is why they decided to sell.

Local residents nicknamed it 'the mushroom house' but Garfinkle said that they have always thought of it as a giant circus tent. 

Stairway: The stairway features several pictures along it which lead up to the bedrooms and bathrooms

Quaint: This bedroom has two wardrobes in it and is a nice addition to the house which has been nicknamed the 'mushroom house'

Art: This stunning house has gorgeous art work throughout, even in the living room and is described as the family's personal art work

Kitchen: It features a spacious kitchen with pots and pans hanging from the ceiling which opens out into the dining room and sitting room

Open plan: Edward and Frances Garfinkle were 'looking for something different when they bought it and did not want to be in a box'

View: The house will offer its new owners incredible views but the project nearly left the current owners bankrupt

It is being listed by real estate company Long and Foster for $1.2 million and is described as 'lending itself to the creative eye.'

Garfinkle said he hopes that its new owners will get to make it into their own home inside, but still keep some of its original design.

'Basically it would be nice if the design was retained and just went on being Bethesda's mushroom house,' he said.

But the proud owners have decided not to do an open house to prevent crowds of people coming just to get a peek inside. 

Bathroom: This bathroom is decorated in blue and carries through the theme of fun, quirky art which can be seen throughout the house

Studio: The owner describes himself as an artist and said he worked with an architect that was into futuristic design

Old and the new: The couple have beautiful exposed beams in their house and curved walls alongside more modern necesities

Design: Local residents nicknamed the house the 'mushroom house' and Garfinkle said they always thought of it as a giant circus tent

Welcome home: The house  is a 3,700 sq. ft. structure that sits on the 4900 block of Allan Rd in Bethesda

The Hobbit: Actor Martin Freeman plays Bilbo in the highly successful Lord of the Rings films based on the J.R.R. Tolkien novels

Box office: The Lord of The Rings and Hobbit films have done extremely well at the box office and grossed one billion dollars

Sale: Garfinkle said he hopes that someone will get to make it into their own home inside  but still retain its original character
