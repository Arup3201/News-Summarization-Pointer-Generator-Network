For most, revisiting an old photo album is approached with a degree of apprehension and trepidation for fear of being mocked about a dodgy haircut or an outbreak of acne. 

Luckily for you, Sportsmail cares not and brings to you the duet of a young David Luiz and Angel di Maria from a 2007 sticker book... luckily both sans an unfortunate skin complexion.

Almost unrecognisable without his trademark long, curly locks, David Luiz cuts a familiar cheeky grin alongside a timid looking Di Maria - now the world's most expensive defender and Britain's most expensive player respectively.

David Luiz now plays for French champions Paris Saint Germain after a £50million move from Chelsea

Di Maria has scored three goals since joining Manchester United, but has been absent since November

Since their days in Portugal the pair have gone from strength to strength, becoming mega-money signings for two of Europe's biggest clubs - the former moving from Chelsea to Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint Germain for £50million last summer.

As his former Benfica team-mate made a move away from the Premier League, Di Maria swapped Real Madrid for Manchester United in the same transfer window in a £60million move.

Despite a fantastic start to his Manchester United career, the Argentine suffered a hamstring injury in his side's 3-0 against Hull at the end of November. 

It was reported on Friday that the winger will also miss this weekend's derby clash with Liverpool.
