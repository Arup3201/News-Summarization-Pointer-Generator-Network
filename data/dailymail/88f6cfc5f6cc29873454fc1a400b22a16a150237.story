Good neighbours? Holly Willoughby and her husband Daniel Baldwin reacted angrily to claims they kept neighbours up with a house party

Her good girl image was somewhat diminished after she wore a very revealing black dress on the final of The Voice last month, prompting 139 complaints to the BBC.

So an ugly neighbourly dispute is the last thing that TV presenter Holly Willoughby will have wanted – not least because she has been accused of ‘keeping the whole neighbourhood up last night with drunken behaviour’.

The accusation was made in an anonymous letter delivered to the £3million home she shares with her TV executive husband Daniel Baldwin and their two young children.

Mr Baldwin, 37, reacted angrily to the letter by emailing 50 neighbours, many of whom the couple have never met, seeking help in tracking down the letter-writer.

He denies creating any such noise, saying he and Miss Willoughby were watching Nashville – a US drama set in the world of country music – and that they want ‘an explanation’ from their critic.

And to assist their hunt, Mr Baldwin attached two images of the woman who delivered the letter, obtained from the CCTV cameras bristling from his luxury home.

Now one furious neighbour has accused the pair of hypocrisy, saying that the couple have unleashed ‘utter building chaos’ on the area over the last year.

David Moss, 55, said: ‘We have been shocked by this vicious intrusive email, in which they make themselves out to be good neighbours, when we have had enormous trucks blocking the pavement six days a week.’

The row has disrupted the usual calm in the well-heeled area of south-west London, where Miss Willoughby and her husband bought their house 18 months ago.

Since then they have lavished hundreds of thousands more on the house, which already boasts an impressive garden and balconies overlooking the Thames.

They have made a series of planning applications, including bids to build a large extension, a garage complete with ‘staff accommodation’, and a large swimming pool.

It seems the neighbours have tolerated the work – but somebody must have snapped on Saturday morning,  when the letter was delivered.

In the afternoon, Mr Baldwin sent out his email, headed, ‘Your help – our neighbourhood’.

It read: ‘Dear Neighbours, this morning this lady left a letter on my doorstep. The letter was extremely rude and overly aggressive (I’ll save you from the gory details).

‘It wrongly accused us of “keeping the whole neighbourhood up last night with drunken behaviour”.

‘In fact the whole house was in bed by 10.30pm – after two episodes of Nashville (please don’t judge me on this!).

‘The letter had no name or house number so I’d very much like to explain this to the lady on the picture and I’d like an explanation from her on the letter’s contents.

‘Her photo, from our CCTV footage is attached. Any help clearing this up would be hugely appreciated.

‘I’d like to think that we live in a neighbourhood where we can freely knock on our neighbours doors and have a civilised chat about any concerns/worries/issues.’

Mr Moss, who works in the NHS, added: ‘They think that they are decent neighbours, but at no point have they apologised for the disruption.

'The trucks and other stuff associated with their building works regularly block the pavement, and those who are elderly, disabled or pushing a pram have to take their life into their hands and walk in the road.

‘Just when we thought it was nearly finished, they have got planning permission to build a big pool in their garden.’

Mr Baldwin and Miss Willoughby, who also presents ITV1’s This Morning, refused to discuss either their email, or the complaints about the work on their home.

The woman in the CCTV image could not be tracked down for comment last night.
