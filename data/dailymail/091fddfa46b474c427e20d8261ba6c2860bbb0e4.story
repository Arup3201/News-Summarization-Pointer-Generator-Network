It is known as 'La Porta del Cielo' - the gateway to heaven.

And looking at the magnificent star-studded ceilings and gilded statues of Siena Cathedral its easy to understand why.

The beautiful interior of the Duomo in Tuscany has drawn tourists for years, but now, after decades of restoration, it is possible to see the 13th Century building from a unique perspective.

Breathtaking: The duomo of the 13th century Siena Cathedral has been a tourist a attraction for many years

Hidden gem: A series of secret walkways and enclosed spaces in the knave of the cathedral can now be visited

Eyes down: from the newly opened walkways visitors can enjoy an aerial view of the biblical and mythical scenes depicted in marble in the cathedral floor

A series of enclosed spaces, 
previously only open to builders under the direction of architects, have
been opened in the vault of the cathedral.

Today the so-called 'Sky' section was opened to members of the public for the first time.

Visitors are now permitted to climb up to a walkway near the top of the 16-metre high nave via a spiral stone staircase in one of two towers that flank the entrance.

From there they can enjoy an aerial view of the medieval and Renaissance mosaics that cover the marble floor, as well as getting closer to its ornate vaulted ceiling, which is painted blue with gold stars.

The thirteenth-century Gothic cathedral is a treasure trove of art, and home to works by Donatello, Bernini and the young Michelangelo.

The cathedral itself was originally designed and completed between 1215 and 1263.

Its distinctive striped columns and walls are made from black and white marble in a nod to Siena's black and white civic coat of arms.

It also features a stained-glass window by Ulisse De Matteis of the Apostles, from which visitors can look down into the cathedral with a view of the floor of the main monuments and sculptures of the interior of the dome.
