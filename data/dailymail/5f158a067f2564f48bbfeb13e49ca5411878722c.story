He truly is a man's best friend.

This is Georges - a football mad dog who is happy to spend hours in front of the TV watching the World Cup.

In the video, Georges can been seen enthusiastically jumping up and down in front of the TV while watching the Argentina v Bosnia and Herzegovina pool game from his U.S. owner's home.

While George's love for the beautiful game is obvious, it's not so clear exactly which team he supportsÂ 

However, his passion for the beautiful game gets hazy when one tries to decipher who he is actually supporting.

According to his owner, he 'doesn't care who wins or loses, as long as he can watch them play.'

But he has every right to be enjoying it so far. Last night Clint Dempsey netted the fifth fastest goal in World Cup history - 29 seconds - while there have been 44 goals in the first 14 matches.

The
 American pup and his owner actually love all sports - Georges is the 
star of a series of videos where he can be seen bellowing at the TV 
screen while watching tennis and the Superbowl.

Argentina fan? George appeared to enjoy the Argentina v Bosnia match in particular, which saw Lionel Messi score the winner
