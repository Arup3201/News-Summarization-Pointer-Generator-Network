A celebrity blogger who accused former X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos of assaulting him at a music festival lied to police about photographic evidence, a court heard today.

Savvas Morgan claims the N-Dubz star hit him at the the V-Festival in Essex in August last year.

Today Miss Contostavlos's lawyer 
confronted him over a 'lost' photograph showing his injuries, which Mr 
Morgan claimed earlier in the trial had been taken after the attack.

He
 was called back to the trial at Chelmsford Magistrates Court by 
district judge Angus Hamilton.

It came after witness Jonathan Shalit made a 
statement claiming that Royston Gooden Legore, who Mr Morgan says took 
the picture, told him in a phone call that it in fact never existed

Tulisa Contostavlos and her assistant Gareth Varey arrive at court today. A celebrity blogger who accused the former X-Factor judge of assaulting him at a music festival has been accused of lying to police about photographic evidence

Mr Morgan told the court today that a picture showing the swollen eye he claims he was given by Contostavlos had existed.

But he then went on to say that it had been deleted by Legore, who told him he was worried about his future in the music industry if he went against the 25-year-old star.

Miss Contostavlos
 is standing trial accused of assault alongside her assistant Gareth 
Varey, 28, who is accused of threatening behaviour.

The pair, both of north London, deny the charges against them.

Her barrister, Jeremy Dein QC, asked Mr Morgan: 'You have misled police throughout regarding the existence of a photo showing injuries to you, haven’t you? That is why Mr Legore has not come forward, because there never was a photograph?'

Mr Morgan denied the claim, replying: 'I don’t need to mislead the police about a picture. If there was no photo, I would have said.

'I was honest from the start and I will keep being honest. If you don’t think there was a photo then that’s the end of it.'

The singer had earlier told the court that Mr Morgan conducted a 'vendetta' 
against her since an incident in which she asked security to remove him 
from a VIP area at the Whisky Mist nightclub in London’s Mayfair.

She also said she believed Mr Morgan was  involved in the release of a sex tape of her online. But added that she had no grudge against him, saying: 'He was one of many.'

In his closing speech today, prosecutor Matthew McNiff said Contostavlos was a 'good actress' and several witnesses had testified against her.

He said: 'We say that she wanted to deal with Mr Morgan. It was personal, very personal.

'She may regret it but that is something different.'

Contostavlos could be seen gently shaking her head at one point during Mr McNiff’s speech.

The trial sat for three days in June before being adjourned to today to allow more witnesses to be heard.

Mr Dein said Mr Morgan was not a person to be believed, saying there had been a 'sinister' undercurrent about the way he acted, including blogging about 'building a case' against Contostavlos.

Mr Morgan was called back to the trial at Chelmsford Magistrates Court after witness Jonathan Shalit made a statement claiming that Royston Gooden Legore, who Mr Morgan says took a picture of his alleged injuries, told him in a phone call that it never existed

He suggested that Mr Morgan made the claim after being publicly 'embarrassed' by the star, potentially damaging his professional reputation.

Mr Dein said: 'There is no indication from anyone anywhere that she is a lady disposed to violence or temper.

'The proposition that this can be dismissed on the basis that she is a good actress is not only offensive but contrary to the evidence the court has heard.'

Mr Dein also raised 335 abusive comments from readers about Contostavlos under Mr Morgan’s blog posts. Along with a copy of Contostavlos’s well-publicised sex tape, they were removed from the website only after the singer obtained a court order, the trial heard.

Mr Dein also questioned the reliability of prosecution witnesses, several of whom were friends of Mr Morgan.

The singer will face a fifth day in court and a wait of three weeks to find out her fate after the judge adjourned the hearing after a day lengthened by extensive legal argument.

He will hand down his verdict at Stratford Magistrates' Court in east London on July 25.

The trial continues.
