Huge bolts of lightening cut through purple clouds as the heavens open above one of the world's most famous and destructive volcanoes.

The spectacular light show over Mount Vesuvius was taken by an amateur British photographer as he holidayed with his wife in the nearby Italian city of Naples.

Richard Stoodley, 56, and wife Christine were enjoying an evening meal in a local restaurant when the storm started, forcing them to rush back to the 4th floor of the San Francesco al Monte.

High drama: Richard Stoodley, 56, was on holiday with his wife Christine when they he took the photo of the volcano from a hotel in Naples

Mr Stoodley used a wide angel lens and strapped his Canon EOS 400d onto a ledge so it would not fall off.

After taking around 30 shots and leaving the camera there for as long as possible, he looked through the photos and noticed he had captured the lightning.

Mr Stoodley, of Malmesbury, Wilts, and is an education assistant, said: 'It was as if by chance, but I would say it is the best photo I have ever taken.

'I looked up photos of Naples and saw sunsets here and sun rises there, but I had never seen an image of lighting over the top.

'We were out having a meal in a local restaurant and had gone back to the hotel when the lightning began.

How it looks by day: Vesuvuis erupted nearly 2,000 years ago and wiped out the nearby Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculeneam

Explosive: The last major eruption was in March 1944 when three villages were destroyed along with part of a US naval base

'I thought it would be a good photo so I thought I would take the opportunity. I left the camera there for as long as I could. I must have taken 30 shots.

'As soon as I uploaded the photo, I got very excited because I knew how good it was. It seemed like it was meant to be, because the day before I had been pick-pocketed.

'We travelled all the way down to Italy by train over four days. We went over the Alps, and I took some pictures of trains entering tunnels and so on, but none of them were as good as this.'

Vesuvuis erupted nearly 2,000 years ago and wiped out the nearby Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculeneam.

The last major eruption was in March 1944 when three villages were destroyed along with part of a US naval base.

It is one of the world's most dangerous volcanoes because of the 3,000,000 people living in its vicinity.
