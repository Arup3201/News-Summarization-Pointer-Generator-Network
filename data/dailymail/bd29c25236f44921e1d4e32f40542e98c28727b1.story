Gunfire was exchanged in eastern Ukraine today as tensions in the region continue to escalate.

Violent confrontations between government troops and Pro-Russian rebels, who have seized administrative
 and police buildings across the east, continued this afternoon.

Dramatic photographs at a 
government-controlled checkpoint in the city of Slovyansk, which has 
been the epicenter of the conflict, showed Ukrainian troops firing round after round at rebels.

Scores of Ukrainian military could be seen stationed around the city.

There have been several attempts in recent 
weeks to break a ring of checkpoints around the city erected by rebels.

Vladislav
 Seleznyov, press secretary for Ukraine's anti-terrorist operation in 
the east, said the army had successfully destroyed a 
cannon in Slovyansk - which he said rebels had been using to shell 
civilian buildings in the town.

Meanwhile in Kiev, protesters burned barricades in Independence Square.

It is not thought there were any casualties in either of the cities.

As
 violence continues to escalate in the region, the Ukrainian and pro-Russian sides 
have blamed each other for the rising number of civilian casualties in 
the conflict.

Today also marked the funeral of Major General Sergei Kulchytsky, Commander of the military unit and Deputy Chief of the Western Territorial Command of Internal Troops.

Kulchytsky and 12 other Ukrainian soldiers were killed as their helicopter was downed by pro-Russian militants on May 29 during an operation near Slavyansk.

Pro-Russian troops were also alleged to have looted a Metro shop near the International airport in Donetsk.

Elsewhere, Russia's Foreign Ministry criticized a suggestion by an OSCE official that the organization could consider withdrawing its observer mission from Ukraine because of safety concerns.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe says it lost contact on Thursday with a group of monitors in separatist eastern Ukraine.

Another group of monitors has been held by eastern rebels since Monday.

Wolfgang Ischinger, the OSCE's negotiator on national dialogue in Ukraine, told German broadcaster ZDF this week that the monitor mission might have to withdraw if the organization fears for its employees' lives.

But the Russian ministry said in a statement Saturday that 'amid Kiev's intentionally intensified punitive operation in the east of the country, it is essential to step up the work of international observers.'
