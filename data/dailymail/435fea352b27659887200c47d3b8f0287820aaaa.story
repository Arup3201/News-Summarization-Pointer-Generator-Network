Serious sports injuries and disease can damage people's muscles and affect their quality of life.

But now there is new hope as scientists have created living muscle that not only functions like the real thing but can heal itself too.

The lab-grown tissue, produced from immature pre-cursor cells - which are blood cells not committed to a particular use - was demonstrated in mice.

Scientists have created living skeletal muscle (pictured) that can heal itself. Here, long, colourful strands of engineered muscle fibre have been stained to allow scientists to observe growth after its implantation into a mouse. Native tissue appears green and engineered tissue red and yellow, because two molecular stains are used. The blue marks are the nuclei of cells that have been stained by another molecule

It is not the first time that muscle has been created, but it is the first time that it has contracted as strongly as native neonatal skeletal muscle.

The new muscle contracts powerfully and rapidly, integrates into mice quickly and demonstrates the ability to heal itself in the lab and inside an animal for the first time.

Every muscle has satellite cells on reserve, ready to activate upon injury and begin the regeneration process.

The key to the team’s success was successfully creating the micro environments called niches, where the stem cells can work effectively.

The scientists tested the muscle by stimulating it with electric pulses, deliberately damaging it with a toxin found in snake venom and watching it through a window on the back of a living mouse.

They believe the technique is a step towards growing viable muscle for studying diseases and treating injuries.

But researchers believe it marks a significant step towards growing viable replacement muscle in humans.

Unlike previous examples of bioengineered
 muscle, the artificially-constructed muscle fibres contract as strongly
 as their natural counterparts.

Satellite cells - dormant step cells that can be activated by injury to regenerate damaged tissue - were at the heart of the self-repair mechanism.

The secret was supplying them with the right environment, the researchers wrote in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

‘Simply implanting satellite cells or less-developed muscle doesn't work as well,’ said Mark Juhas, a graduate student and member of the team from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

This series of images shows the destruction and recovery of the engineered muscle fibres that were exposed to a toxin found in snake venom. The scientists proved for the first time that engineered muscle can repair itself after implantation into a living animal. Here, blue represents damaged muscle  

‘The well-developed muscle we made provides niches for satellite cells to live in and when needed to restore the robust musculature and its function.’

Stimulating the tissue with electric pulses to make it contract showed that the engineered muscle was more than 10 times stronger than any previous lab muscle produced.

After damaging muscle with snake venom toxin, the satellite cells stepped in, activating, multiplying and repairing the injured muscle fibres.

The scientists watched the muscle integrate and mature in a living animal through small glass windows inserted into the backs of mice.

A genetic modification causing the muscle fibres to produce fluorescent flashes when they contracted made it possible to observe them growing stronger in real time. The stronger they got, the brighter they flashed.

‘We could see and measure in real time how blood vessels grew into the implanted muscle fibres, maturing toward equalling the strength of its native counterpart,’ said Mr Juhas.

Both the lab-grown muscle and experimental techniques are important steps toward growing viable muscle for studying diseases and treating injuries, said Nenad Bursac, associate professor of biomedical engineering at the university.

'The muscle we have made represents an important advance for the field. It’s the first time engineered muscle has been created that contracts as strongly as native neonatal skeletal muscle.'
