A pistol thought to have belonged to famous Edwardian murderer Dr Crippen has been handed in to police during a firearm amnesty. 

The owner told police the gun once belonged to Hawley Harvey Crippen, the American medic hanged in Pentonville Prison for the murder of his wife Cora Henrietta Crippen.

Crippen rose to infamy by allegedly poisoning and dismembering his wife, hiding her remains under the basement floor, and fleeing for Canada with his lover Ethel Le Neve who had disguised herself as a young boy for the journey. 

The handgun was given to police as party of an amnesty held last month which saw 446 weapons and 15,721 rounds of amunition surrendered in two weeks.

Crippen was born in Michigan and his first wife, Charlotte, died of a stroke in 1882. 

Having qualified as a homoeopath, he started to practice in New York where in 1894 he married his second wife Corrine 'Cora' Turner. They moved to England three years later. 

While in England, he took Le Neve for his mistress after she had been lodging at his house to support his meagre income. 

After his wife mysteriously disappeared in January 1910, he fled to Brussels with Le Neve, who was a young typist.

The couple then boarded a ferry for Canada but the ship’s Captain Henry George Kendall recognised them and notified police who arrested them when the boat docked in North America.

Crippen went on trial in October 1910 and was found guilty by a jury after just 27 minutes of deliberation. He was hanged at Pentonville Prison, London, on November 23, 1910.

Police found the remains of Crippen's wife's body buried under the brick floor of the basement of their London home after searching it for the fourth time.

Large quantities of the toxic compound hyoscine were found in her remains and the court heard Crippen had bought the drug before the murder from a local chemist.

Le Neve was acquitted of being an accessory to murder and emigrated to the U.S on the morning of Crippen’s execution. 

Other unusual items handed to Devon and Cornwall police in the amnesty include a set of antique duelling pistols and a flare gun used in the trenches of World War One.   

The vast majority of the firearms handed in have been destroyed by being cut into small and irreparable pieces which will be used for scrap metal. 

Investigators recovered  headless corpse from a shallow grave inside Dr Crippen's basement, but DNA evidence has since proved it was a man 

American born Dr Harvey Crippen moved to Holloway in north London with his second wife Cora. She disappeared following a party at the couple's house in January 1910.

Friends of Mrs Crippen became suspicious after seeing Crippen's mistress, who moved into the house, wearing her clothes and jewellery.  

An initial search by Scotland Yard found no evidence of any foul play, however, Dr Crippen fled with his mistress to Canada. 

After he disappeared, Scotland Yard conducted three further searches of the property where they recovered human remains.  

Crippen and his mistress were travelling on the SS Montrose when the captain of the vessel, who was keeping up-to-date with the news on the newly installed wireless, telegraphed Scotland Yard. 

Crippen's mistress, Ethel Le Neve, was travelling disguised as a young boy. 

An inspected boarded a faster vessel and raced Crippen across the Atlantic, arresting him upon his arrival in Canada. 

Had he boarded a vessel to New York, he would have probably escaped punishment. 

Crippen was returned to the Old Bailey where he was found guilty of murder after less than 30 minutes and hanged in Pentonville Prison in November 1910. 

The human remains recovered by Scotland Yard were badly decomposed and more than 100 years after their recovery, it is believed that the bones belonged to a man.

Attempts have been made by distant relatives of Dr Crippen to exonerate him, however his body remains inside the walls of Pentonville Prison. 

A study reported in the Journal of Forensic Science in America by scientist David Foran said: 'Based on genealogical and DNA research, the tissue used to convict Dr Crippen was not that of Cora.

‘Further DNA testing showed the tissue was male. All we can say scientifically is, the tissue did not come from Cora.

‘One possibility is that Crippen murdered someone else and those were the remains discovered. Another possibility is that the celebrated investigators planted the evidence.’
