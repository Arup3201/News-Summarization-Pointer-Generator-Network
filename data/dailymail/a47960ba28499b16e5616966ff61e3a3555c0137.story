A deaf and mute girl was trafficked into Britain by an elderly couple to act as a sex slave.

She was ten years old when she was spirited from her home in Pakistan to serve ‘evil’ businessman Ilyas Ashar, 84, and his wife Tallat.

Forced to sleep in the cellar, she was repeatedly raped by Ashar.

She was also forced to carry out all the menial chores in the £300,000 house, including cooking, cleaning, sewing, washing and ironing.

Brutal: Ashar was found  guilty of 13 charges of rape at Munshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, while his wife Tallat (right) was found guilty of two counts of trafficking a person into the UK for exploitation and four counts of furnishing false information to obtain benefits

Yesterday, after two trials spanning six months and an investigation costing over £4million, Ashar and his wife Tallat, 67, were facing jail after they were convicted of trafficking for exploitation and benefit fraud.

Ashar was separately convicted of 13 charges of rape. His wife was cleared of a charge of assault.

The girl, who is now 20 and has five brothers and a sister living in Pakistan, recalls meeting the Ashars there and putting her thumbprint on a document believed to be her passport.

She arrived in the UK on June 24, 2000, with her passport saying she was 19. She was given free board and lodgings with the Ashars and was initially given gifts such as bracelets.

But then she was asked to work and began packing football shirts and mobile phone covers to sell on market stalls before becoming the couple’s personal domestic slave at the home in Eccles, Manchester.

For up to nine years, she slept on a concrete floor in the cellar and was regularly berated about her work.

The girl spent 49 days reliving her nightmare – a record number of days for a victim of rape in the British judicial system.

She gave her testimony by video link in a private room. She was accompanied throughout by two interpreters who had to translate in both sign language and in Urdu. They in-turn were monitored by two other interpreters in the room while a language expert was sat in court. The Ashars also had an interpreter.

Their victim told Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester: ‘I was sad and weak because I was working so hard. I had to clean all the time and that was it – that was my life. I’d cook and clean for hours.’

Lights in the cellar would be flicked on and off when her captors needed her. ‘The lady got angry because I was making too much noise, but I wouldn’t know I was making noise.

‘I would be sitting in there crying for hours and hours, sitting alone.’

Property: The Victorian house in Cromwell Road, Salford, where the victim was beaten and forced to carry out household chores

Shown a photo of Mr Ashar, the girl said: ‘The old man, he’s bad. He’s the one who has sex with me.’

Peter
Cadwallader, prosecuting at the first trial, said the girl was also 
made to clean for friends and relations of the Ashars. He added: ‘She 
was physically abused, she was sexually abused and she was exploited 
economically. She had nowhere to go. Who could she have turned to? She 
knew nothing else.’

The 
Ashars illegally claimed housing benefit and income support using her 
name. They were arrested in June 2009 after police went to the house 
about a separate matter and found the girl in the cellar.

Throughout the trial the girl was worried the Ashars might seek revenge. She is now in a witness protection programme.

Salford
council social services has taught her sign language since her 
discovery, and head of department Sue Lightup said her progress was like 
‘a butterfly coming out of a chrysalis.’

Detective Chief Superintendent 
Mary Doyle branded Ashar ‘evil’ and said the girl had shown ‘remarkable 
courage’
