An amber chess board taken by King Charles 1 to his execution has been sold for a record £600,000.

The board was owned by the controversial King, who was such an enthusiast for chess he was engrossed in a game when a messenger told him he had been betrayed by the Scots to the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War.

The news sealed the royal's fate and he was executed on January 30, 1649.

Royal game: The chess board believed to have been owned by King Charles I, which has been sold for a record breaking £600,000 at an auction

Final moves: The amber board opens up to reveal a board for the game backgammon, one of the oldest board games for two players which also involves an element of luck

Strategy games: On the other side of the piece is a board for the game Nine Men's Morris, which has also been known as Cowboy Checkers

It is known the King took with him 
two precious possessions to the scaffold where he was beheaded: a Bible 
and an amber games board, believed to be the one that has now sold for £601,250.

Erik Bijzet, an expert in European sculpture at auctioneers Sotherby's, said: 'This board was made by Georg Schreiber who was known as the "King of the Gamesboards".

'He was an amber worker in Koeningsberg, the capital of Prussia, 
where amber washed up on the shores of the East Sea in small amounts.

Chess enthusiast: Charles, pictured here with what is believed to be a chess piece around his neck, was an avid fan of the 'King's Game', known to have been used to teach war strategy

'The board is dated 1607 and was given to either James I or Henry Frederick as Charles was only seven-years-old then.

'When
at the height of the Civil War a messenger arrived to inform Charles 
that he had been betrayed by the Scots he didn't rise from his game of 
chess, even though his fate had effectively been sealed.

'Charles took a Bible and a games board with him to the scaffold where he was beheaded.'

Following his death the items were passed on to his personal chaplain, Bishop William Juxon, who read Charles his last rites.

The board then remained in his family until the 18th century before it was acquired by British peer Sir Robert Hesketh.

It has now been sold by the Second Baron Hesketh's Will Trust.

The board was bought at auction in London by a private collector, following a dramatic bidding war, for £601,250, the highest amount ever paid for an amber games board.

Mr Bijzet said: 'It entered into the ownership of the Hesketh family and an inventory of their possessions is the earliest record that mentions that the board belonged to Charles.

Execution: King Charles was believed to have taken the amber chess board to the scaffold where he was beheaded for high treason in 1649

'Besides the provenance, this board is a tour-de-force of amber working, is of superb quality and was made by the maker of Royal chess sets.

'We only know of four comparable boards, none of which have seemed to survive in good condition.'

The board, which measures 27ins by 13ins, opens into two halves, allowing it to be used for different games including chess, backgammon, draughts and Nine Men's Morris, a strategy board game which emerged from the Roman Empire.

The board would have been extremely sought after and expensive during the 17th century due to amber being found only in small quantities.

Mr Bijzet said: 'Everyone in the saleroom seemed to hold their breath when the bidding went down to the collectors.

'As these two reached the limits of their resources a third contender in the front row entered the bidding and won the object.'

King Charles I, was the first monarch to be tried and executed for treason.

His final years were dominated by the English Civil War, which saw him battle the English and Scottish parliaments who were challenging his bid to to do away with parliamentary authority.

He also used his position as head of the English Church to pursue religious policies which angered reformed groups such as the Puritans.

He was defeated in the First Civil War, which lasted from 1642 to 1645, and was expected to accept Parliament's demands for a constitutional monarchy.

However, Charles attempted to forge an alliance with Scotland, prompting the start of the Second Civil War in 1648.

He was defeated for a second time and subsequently tried and executed for high treason, in 1649.

The monarchy was abolished and the Commonwealth of England, also known as the Cromwellian Interregnum, came into power.

An 11-year gap in royal rule followed before Charles' son, Charles II, took the reins in the restoration of 1660.
