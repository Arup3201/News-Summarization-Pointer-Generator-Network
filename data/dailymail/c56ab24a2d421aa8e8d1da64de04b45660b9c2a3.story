A robber has been jailed for life for battering to death a partially sighted 91-year-old whose home he was burgling.

Scott Melville, 38, attacked Sydney Pavier at the pensioner's home in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, leaving him for dead with 'horrendous' head injuries.

It was only after relatives later found the pensioner unconscious and covered in footprints from the battering that he was taken to hospital, where he died a month later.

'Intensely proud of his independence': Sydney Pavier, left, had refused the help of carers and still lived in his home of 83 years, where he was beaten to death by burglar Scott Melville, right, who was today jailed for life

Melville, of no fixed address, denied murder but was convicted by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court after a five-day trial.

Judge James Burbidge QC sentenced him to life, with a a minimum term of 26 years.

The court heard that Melville had smashed his way into Mr Pavier's home of 83 years in the early hours of September 16 and ransacked the property as he hunted for valuables.

When he came across Mr Pavier, an Army veteran and former carpenter whose sight was failing, he began punching and kicking him until he was unconscious.

Relatives calling in on Mr Pavier later that morning found the door smashed and the pensioner bloodied and unconscious on his bed.

He was rushed to University Hospital, Coventry, where he lost his fight for life just over a month later, on October 28.

Speaking after the sentence Detective Chief Inspector James Essex, of Warwickshire Police, said: 'This sentence reflects the violence inflicted by Melville, but it cannot in any way equate for taking the life of a frail old gentleman who had proudly maintained his independence at his home in Gordon Street, Leamington, despite his failing eyesight.

'Sydney had served in the Army and worked as a carpenter in Leamington until he retired some years ago.

'He was a man of modest means, with little of value in his home and although in later years he seldom went out, he kept himself up to date on what was happening in the world through his radio.

'Intensely proud of his independence, he had resolutely refused the help of carers, and had only reluctantly accepted some assistance from relatives when his failing eyesight meant he could no longer cook his meals properly.

'Why Melville chose to break into Sydneyâ€™s home, why he then attacked this defenceless, partially sighted frail old man, we cannot know.

'Sydney was found badly beaten, lying unconscious on his bed, when relatives called to see him on the morning of 16 September last year.

'The door had been kicked in and the house ransacked.

'Despite his horrendous injuries, Sydney battled to live, but more than a month later on the 28th October he sadly lost his fight for life.'

Melville also previously pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery involving the theft of a mobile phone two days before the break in and the burglary at the Next Stop newsagents in Leamington Spa on the same day he attacked Mr Pavier.

Judge Burbidge QC ordered that there would be no separate penalty for the robbery and burglary charges.
