A 25-year old Red Star Belgrade fan was stabbed to death during violence before a Euroleague basketball match in Istanbul on Friday. 

'It was an act of hostility and a terrible tragedy ... I am distraught,' Zoran Markovic, the Serbian consul in the Turkish capital, told Serbia's state television (RTS).

Red Star fans had travelled to Istanbul despite a ban on visiting supporters watching the match

'We had been warning the Turkish authorities for two days prior to the game that it was going to be a high-risk match and we are now trying to make sure that all Red Star fans leave Turkey safely as soon as possible.

'I also wish to stress that the doctors fought like lions for the young man's life after he was rushed to hospital, the resuscitation attempts lasted five hours but he died because he had lost too much blood.'

Galatasaray won the Euroleague encounter 110-103 in double overtime

Trouble flared outside the Abdi Ikpeci Arena in Istanbul  when around 400 Red Star fans arrived but were banned from watching the match against Galatasaray, according to RTS.

RTS reported that riot police then moved in with tear gas to quell the violence.

The station also said Turkish media had reported that Red Star fans demolished several cars and shop windows in the area as they retreated.

Galatasaray won the match 110-103 in double overtime.
