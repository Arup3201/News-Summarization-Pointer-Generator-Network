Jose Mourinho has revealed that Chelsea’s players pay the fines if they are charged by the authorities for surrounding referees.

Chelsea’s manager made the admission after his team surrounded Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers over the dismissal of Paris Saint-Germain forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Wednesday in the Champions League.

Mourinho, who was in a spiky mood on Friday, said: ‘If the players surround the referee we are charged and we have to pay a fine.

'If we do that the players pay the fine. We have eight or nine months and we were charged once and we paid for that.

'Go to the Premier League and see how many were charged. We were charged once.

'I had a meeting with the players, but I am working for the future. I don’t have to share with you. It was good and interactive.If you want to speak Champions League you have to go to (Arsene) Wenger or (Manuel) Pellegrino (Pellegrini), they have one match to play. 

'If you want to speak Champions League, speak with them. We lost zero matches - we were not good enough to make the result we needed. We are out of the Champions League, so we speak about it next season. We need to finish in the top four.  

'Only the champion is a head of the group, so we cannot be protected by the co-efficient next season.'

The 52-year-old was in a typically defiant mood during his press conference on Friday afternoon

Mourinho also insisted his team will win the Barclays Premier League title after they exited the Champions League against PSG.

He added: 'It is my responsibility. The people that lost, is the same people who are top of the Premier League since day one and won the Capital One Cup and the same people who will win the Premier League.

'We have 11 matches, we have five point advantage, we have a game in hand. We cannot promise we win every game, but we are optimistic.'

The Blues boss also aimed a thinly veiled barb towards Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher following the criticism of his team on Wednesday night. 

Carragher called the pressure Chelsea put on the officials 'disgraceful' and said it came from manager Jose Mourinho, while Souness said Oscar's play acting was 'pathetic'.

Mourinho added: 'The world is a bit strange, what with the diet and the quality of products we are eating, because memories are getting short.

'When Graeme Souness and Carragher speak about it they are having a problem for sure.

'The game finished and to close the Champions League chapter, I did that in the tunnel, one by one every one from PSG I shook their hands and told them they deserved it.

Sky Sports pundit Souness branded the Chelsea players 'pathetic' for their antics on Wednesday

'Jamie stopped two years ago and in two years ago he has forgotten everything. Mr Souness had stopped playing for a long time and he has done that.

'I was at Benfica a couple of years after him, so I know a lot about him. I prefer to laugh, and I prefer to say that they envy is the biggest tribute to us from people in the shadows.'
