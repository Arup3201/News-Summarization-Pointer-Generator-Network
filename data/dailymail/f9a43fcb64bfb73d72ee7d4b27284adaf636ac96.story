A would-be motorist, who has spent more than £5,000 on 250 lessons over a 14-year period has been blacklisted from her local driving schools due to her failure to pass the test. 

Janine Mars, 31, has had five different driving instructors only to fail her practical test four times. 

Yet, despite the intensive instruction, Ms Mars is still unable to pull away from a junction without stalling her car.

She said, now the situation is so bad, she cannot find an instructor near her home in Chatham, Kent, willing to take her because of her poor motoring skills.

It is estimated that during her driving lessons, Ms Mars has driven the equivalent of a road trip between London and Perth in Australia.  

According to Ms Mars: 'After a few years I stopped counting how much I’d spent.

'It’s definitely more than £5,000 now, which is crazy. I could have bought a brand new car for that!

'I can’t give up now though, I’ve invested too much to stop.'

Ms Mars started driving as soon as she was old enough, but changed instructor after 15 lessons because they didn’t get on.

When she moved to her second teacher, she had more than 100 lessons before realising he wasn’t going to put her forward for a test.

In 2012 she chose a third instructor, before moving to a fourth expert - even sitting double lessons - without success. 

Eventually she tried a fifth instructor in August last year, but failed her most recent test. 

Ms Mars said: 'Every year since 2001, passing my driving test has been my New Year’s resolution.

'I took a break after my last test in October but I want to do an intensive week course.

'I reckon that’s the only way I can pass now.

'The last time I tried to get an instructor in Kent nobody would take me because they know how bad I am.

'It’s as if I’ve been blacklisted. I don’t blame them though!'

But Ms Mars, pictured, said she is having difficulty finding a driving instructor willing to take her on

Despite her inability to pass her test, Ms Mars has never had an accident and believes her problem is a lack of confidence.  

'Driving doesn’t come naturally to me. I can’t quite master using both legs and hands at different times. I’ve had the same problem for the last 14 years.

'I’ve never had a crash or accident. Everything will be going really well, calm driving, and then suddenly I fall to pieces. It might only be a minor thing, like I miss a junction or turn, and I’ll be thrown completely off course.

'Everyone tells me I’ll get over that - but 250 lessons later and I’m still waiting.'

Now Ms Mars plans ahead before each driving lesson, having developed a routine to help get her into the correct frame of mind. 

She revealed: 'Before I get in the car, I eat a big breakfast and drink a mug of tea.

'Then, without fail, I play Happy by Pharrell to get myself into a more relaxed mindset. I’ve experimented with different music, but some of them would get me too pumped up. Even with doing that I still have the same issues.'

Ms Mars' mother Radha, 62, has even tried to encourage her daughter with the offer of cash towards her first car. 

She said: 'I can’t wait for her to pass.

“She’s a real diva in the car. Despite the fact she hasn’t passed her test she’s the world’s best backseat driver. She’s always saying "Mum, don’t do that" or "go here".

'I’m so desperate to stop carting her round, I’ve promised I’ll go halves on a new car once she passes!'

Ms Mars said she has not given up her dream of owning her own car. 

She added: 'Maybe I’m just one of those people born to be driven. I’m fed up of planning my life around train and bus timetables too. It takes almost twice as long as driving. My mum has promised to go halves on a new car once I pass so that’s even more of an incentive.' 

Ms Mars said she might be the type of person who is 'born to be driven' but still plans to continue trying
