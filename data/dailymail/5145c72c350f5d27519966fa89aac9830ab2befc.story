Is this Jihadi George? Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary could be one of the so-called 'Beatles' alongside Mohammed Emwazi

A London rapper who fled to Syria could be Jihadi George - the second of the ISIS hostage-taking cell known as 'The Beatles'. 

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary slipped out of Britain to join the barbaric extremists in 2013 and may have done so alongside Mohammed Emwazi, who was unmasked as Jihadi John earlier this week.

Bary, dubbed the 'hip-hop jihadist', and Emwazi grew up just streets apart in west London and one expert last night claimed it made sense for both men to be part of the sick 'Beatles' kidnap group.

The two militants are believed to know each other and it is possible that Bary is one of the captors known as George, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Released hostages have previously revealed that their kidnappers were known as the Beatles because of their British accents. 

Haras Rafiq, managing director of the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think tank, said: 'It would make sense that Bary could well be George.'

The security services long-suspected that Emwazi was not the only Briton among the terrorist group. 

Bary was a rising talent in London's hip-hop scene - performing under the name L Jinny - before leaving his parents' £1million home in Maida Vale to fight in Syria.

Last year many believed he could be ISIS executioner Jihadi John - the masked terrorist who has appeared in a number of the extremists' sickening beheading videos who is now known to be Emwazi.

Although Bary shares many similar facial features with Emwazi, security officials ruled him out as the terrorist ringleader using voice recognition software.

Fighter: After travelling to Syria in 2013, Bary posted pictures online showing him wielding machine guns

Pictures of Bary before he fled from the UK show him wearing western labels such as Adidas hoodies as he raps in a studio, while another shot shows him squaring up to riot police.

But once he reached Syria, pictures emerged of him wielding a machine gun, an AK-47 and an M16 assault rifle while wearing military fatigues.

Many of the images came from a Facebook page dating back to 2012 which has since been deleted.

In posts alongside the images he attacks 'western propaganda' and wrote: 'Shame on you Muslims that are embarrassed of mujahids/jihads...'

In another post he added: 'Those who strive to defend the lives and freedom of helpless women and children are branded as blackguards, extremists, Islamists and terrorists.'

Bary also posted sickening images online of himself posing with the severed head of a Syrian soldier, accompanied by a joke.

A former friend said: 'People have got into his head - it's transformed a talented young guy into a vengeful extremist.'

Bary was last said to be in Raqqa, a Syrian ISIS stronghold believed to be near where some of the beheading videos have been filmed.

Both Emwazi and Bary left Britain in 2013, meaning it could well be possible that they travelled together.

Emwazi first tried to leave Britain in 2009, claiming he was going to Tanzania on safari with a group of friends.

He was sent back to the UK after security officials feared he was attempting to join terrorist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia. 

Emwazi tried to leave Britain for Kuwait in 2010 and 2013, but was stopped by security officials once more.

He disappeared from his parents' home a week later, with his parents reporting him missing after three days. 

They claim it was four months before police arrived at their home and said they had information he was in Syria.

A source who claimed to have met Emwazi in Syria told Channel 4 News that he was a member of one of the earliest groups from London who travelled to fight for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate.
