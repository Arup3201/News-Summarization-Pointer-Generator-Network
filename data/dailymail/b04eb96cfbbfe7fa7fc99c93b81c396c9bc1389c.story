MPs have overwhelmingly voted for the controversial badger call to be abandoned in favour of vaccination.

The backbench vote, of 219 to 1, has no direct consequences, but campaign groups described it as a ‘disaster’ for the Government.

They said it leaves the Coalition with no alternative but to hold an full vote before deciding whether to extend the cull.

All in favour: MPs voted 219 to 1 in favour of the controversial badger cull which activists blast as a 'disaster'

The pilot scheme, which began last autumn, aimed to control the spread of bovine TB by killing at least 70 per cent of the badgers in  zones in west Somerset and West Gloucestershire. 

But the latest as yet unpublished figures, compiled by an independent expert panel appointed by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, show that both areas failed to reach these targets.

Plus, up to 18 per cent of the animals took longer than five minutes to die – many more than the 5 per cent figure for the cull to be judged humane, the Commons heard.

Conservative MP Anne Main, who tabled the motion to abandon the cull, said that while she acknowledges the ‘hardship and heartache’ TB causes farmers, the independent commission’s conclusions are ‘damning’.

The vote comes two years after Brian May launched his protest against wiping out 70 per cent of badgers

Environment Minister George Eustice acknowledged that the cull could be improved but said that vaccines are ‘still far from fully effective’.

He added: ‘I know this is a sentimental issue for many people... all I would say I hope MPs can develop some perspective because the reality is shooting is used as a means of controlling foxes and all sorts of other wildlife.’

But charities said the Government must now ditch any plans to extend the cull.

Dominic Dyer, of charities the Badger Trust and Care for the Wild, said: ‘This is a huge disaster for the badger cull policy.’
