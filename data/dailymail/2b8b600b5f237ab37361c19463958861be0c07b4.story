Ebola-stricken nurse Nina Pham's condition was downgraded to fair on Friday, according to doctors at the National Institutes of Health.

The 26-year-old nurse, who contracted Ebola while caring for Thomas Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, was previously described as being in a good condition on Thursday.

According to the American Hospital Association's scale used to describe a patient's health, a 'fair condition' is listed as worse than a 'good condition'.

Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a briefing outside the Maryland hospital on Friday that Miss Pham was in a 'fair, stable condition and resting comfortably'.

He did not describe further details of her condition due to patient confidentiality but said she still had Ebola symptoms. 

Dr Fauci denied that Miss Pham was deteriorating adding that she is sitting up, talking with staff and eating.

Dr Fauci added that the nurse is getting 'optimum, intensive care' but said she is extremely fatigued because Ebola 'knocks you out'.

The doctor described the nurse as 'a trooper' adding that she was being cared for round-the-clock by a specialized team of doctors and nurses. 

The nurse, who got a dose of antibody-rich serum from Dr Kent Brantly who survived Ebola, could get other experimental treatments, NBC reported.  

Miss Pham's mother and sister were in the area while she undergoes treatment in a specialized quarantine unit at NIH.

The 26-year-old nurse contracted Ebola after volunteering to care for 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan. Mr Duncan, 42, passed away on October 8 from the deadly disease. 

On Thursday, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital released a video showing the bittersweet moment Ebola-patient Nina Pham said goodbye to her doctor before leaving Dallas for further treatment in Maryland.

In the video released at Ms Pham's request, her treating physician in Dallas gets emotional as he sees her off on her trip to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda.

'Thanks for getting well. Thanks for being part of the volunteer team to take care of our first patient,' Dr Weinstein is heard saying, as he focuses the camera on Miss Pham, reclining in her hospital bed. 

Amber Vinson, 29, was the second nurse diagnosed with Ebola after caring for Thomas Duncan 

'It means a lot. This has been a huge effort by all of you,' he added, before tearing up. Ms Pham then smiled and told her doctor not to cry. 

'We're really proud of you,' Dr Weinstein said.

Miss Pham then started crying herself, and another physician, standing by in full hazmat suit, handed her a tissue to wipe away her tears.

The camera didn't linger on Miss Pham long enough to see where she disposed of the wet tissue after drying her eyes.

'I love you guys,' she said.

'We love you, Nina,' Dr Weinstein responded, at the end of the video.

The 26-year-old was discharged from the Dallas hospital on Thursday evening to fanfare as her coworkers gathered outside the building to see her off, holding up signs reading 'Get well' and 'You're a rock star'.

She landed in Bethesda, Maryland around 10.40pm (ET) and was admitted to NIH hospital shortly before midnight.

On Thursday, Miss Pham asked Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to release a statement on her behalf thanking her family, friends and co-workers for the outpouring of support.

‘I feel very blessed, and have gained strength from their support. I appreciate everything that my coworkers [sic] have done to care for me at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas,’ the nurse stated.

‘I’m doing really well thanks to this team, which is the best in the world. I believe in my talented coworkers. I am #presbyproud!’

The press release from the beleaguered hospital also included a statement from Dr Gary Weinstein, chief of pulmonology and critical care medicine, who described the decision to transfer Miss Pham to Maryland as a difficult one.

‘We’re so glad she has improved so much in such a short amount of time,’ he said. 

‘Our prayers are with her, and she’ll be in wonderful hands at NIH.’ 

Hospital spokesperson Candace White added that it is in the best interest of everyone involved to 'give the hospital an opportunity to prepare for whatever comes next'.

Meanwhile, the City of Dallas released new photos of Miss Pham's beloved Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Bentley, looking cheerful during quarantine at the Dallas Animal Services and Adoption Center. 

The dog is  being cared for by professionals in protective Hazmat suits. City spokeswoman Sana Syed tweeted that Bentley was doing well considering the sudden separation from his owner.

‘Bentley is settling in, getting used to new routines. The cutie played w/ new toy and snuggled w/ vet,’ she wrote on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Presbyterian Hospital was treating two Ebola patients - Miss Pham and nurse Amber Vinson, both employees of the hospital who contracted Ebola from Mr Duncan.

Late on Wednesday night, Miss Vinson, 29, was flown out of Dallas to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, to be cared for in a specialized unit.

On Wednesday, Presbyterian Hospital was treating two Ebola patients - Ms Pham and nurse Amber Vinson, both employees of the hospital who contracted the disease while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan. 

By tonight, the hospital will have zero Ebola patients in its care after federal officials ordered both of them moved to specialized facilities. 

Miss Vinson was flown out of Dallas to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta Wednesday night.

There are four hospitals with infectious disease isolation wards in the United States. Three of the centers are currently treating patients

Nurses have come forward to allege that training and procedures at the hospital were not adequate to protect them. 

Medical records released by Mr Dunca's family revealed that during his first two days in the hospital, nurses did not wear protective hazmat gear when treating him.

Nurses also complained that their necks and wrists were exposed in the suits that they were given, that some supervisors said face masks weren't necessary and that Duncan was not isolated for hours before he was admitted to the hospital.

All these claims follow the shocking news weeks ago that Duncan was sent home on September 26 with a prescription for antibiotics when he first showed up at the hospital - despite telling nurses he had traveled from West Africa. 

There are currently four Americans being treated for Ebola in the United States. 

NBC News freelancer Ashoka Mukpo is being treated at University of Nebraska Medical Center in Lincoln. 

Miss Vinson is at Emory University Hospital, along with an American World Health Organization doctor, who has not been identified, who contracted the disease while working in Sierre Leone. 

The only U.S. hospital with an infectious disease isolation unit that has thus far not treated an Ebola patient is St Patrick Hospital in Missoula, Montana.   

There are four special infectious disease hospitals in the US - one in Maryland, one in Atlanta, one in Nebraska and one in Montana
