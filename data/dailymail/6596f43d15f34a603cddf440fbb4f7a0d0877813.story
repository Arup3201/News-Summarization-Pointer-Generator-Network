Chest deep in filthy water, Mark Corthine clutches treasured family photos he managed to salvage from his abandoned home.

The retired Army major was forced to don a diving suit for an emotional return to the flooded farmhouse.

He and his wife Sharon had been warned that rain forecast over the next few days could mean the floodwaters will reach the ceiling on the ground floor of their home – finishing off what remains of their possessions.

With the water level already at chest height inside the house many villagers fear water levels could rise as high as the roof of a first floor

So the 62-year-old returned by kayak to the property in Fordgate, Somerset, to rescue what he could.

He
 found the building flooded with their once pristine cream-coloured 
sofas floating in a sea of muddy brown water to the depth of four feet. 
The couple’s efforts to keep the water back by the use of pumps had 
failed.

Mr Corthine’s 
mission was to retrieve antiques and keepsakes from the wreckage, 
including his 42-year-old wedding album and prized photographs of him 
meeting Princess Diana.

Corthine has given up on most of his possessions, choosing instead to focus on cherished family memories like his wedding photos

Corthine had to return to his house using water sports equipment, floating his possessions away in full waterproof gear

He 
said: ‘I’ll admit, both me and my wife have shed a tear but it’s hard 
not to. We built this house ourselves and then rebuilt it again last 
year after we had flood water in the house. Nearly everything is ruined –
 it’s such a shame.

‘Every 
now and again you come across a little piece of history – a photograph 
or something – which hasn’t been ruined and it feels amazing.

‘One thing I came for was to try to save my wedding photos as my wife is desperate to have them.

‘They are a bit wet but hopefully we can dry them out and get them digitally remastered.’

Among the waves: Debris and parts from nearby flooded houses are strewn in the water, making it a hazardous environment for those seeking to reclaim belongings

Mr
 and Mrs Corthine, who is 61, were on holiday in Australia when the 
flooding hit their £300,000 home on the edge of the Somerset Levels last
 month.

They cut their break
 short to fly home in the hope of pumping the water out, but were forced
 to abandon the attempt and evacuated the property last week as the 
water level continued to rise.

The
 house-proud couple left their furniture on makeshift stilts in the hope
 it would keep it out of the flood. Photograph albums were left on top 
of cabinets.

But the tide rose mercilessly, engulfing their possessions and contaminating their water supply.

Last
 year’s flood caused £31,000 worth of damage and forced them out of 
their home for four months while it was replastered, redecorated and the
 oak wood floor was replaced. They were able to move back only three 
months ago and fear the latest flooding may mean their home will become 
uninhabitable in the future.

They bought the property  23 years ago and were told it was not on a flood plain and had never flooded.

The Levels have seen the worst of the country’s flooding and some areas have been under water since late December.

The Environment Agency has been criticised for failing to dredge key rivers.

Mr
 Corthine said: ‘We are being told to expect a lot more rain. It 
wouldn’t surprise me if the flood water reaches the ceiling of the first
 floor if that is the case.

‘If
 that happens we will probably have to tear the house down and start 
again. If it comes to that I hope the Government just buys the house 
from us to turn the whole place into a reservoir.

‘What makes this so much more difficult is that this has all been caused by fellow human beings.

‘This wouldn’t have happened if the Government had cracked on with dredging the rivers and ignored EU policies.

‘This is a problem caused by lack of river management, which could have so easily been fixed.’
