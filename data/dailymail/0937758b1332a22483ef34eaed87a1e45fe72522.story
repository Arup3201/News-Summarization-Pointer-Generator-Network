Psychic: The wannabe glamour model is selling her services online

Josie Cunningham - who gained notoriety for claiming a breast operation on the NHS - is now working as a psychic.

Ms Cunningham, 24, charges £70 per hour for her services, advertising her 'special powers' on online classified-hub Gumtree.

This comes just weeks after the mother-of-three announced that she has been given her own Channel 4 documentary, although the channel said the programme had not yet been finalised. 

'I've always thought I might be psychic, I often saw random flashes and shadows as a kid, ' Miss Cunningham told The Sun.

'I've been watching YouTube videos on how to channel my gift and £70 per hour seems fair,' she said, adding that her services had been booked withing 15 minutes of her uploading the advertisement on Gumtree.

'I still want to be a glamour model but this will tide me over until I get a new nose.'

The 24-year-old shot to notoriety when she boasted about having a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS.

Anger over her shameless boasts about life of benefits grew when she claimed she considered aborting her child so she could appear on TV show Big Brother.

Even her mother has since said she has only  herself to blame for becoming despised by much of the British public.

Her dreams of appearing on her own TV programme seem to have come true after Channel 4 decided to make her the star of a documentary.

Her agent, Rob Cooper, tweeted on New Year;s Eve: 'CONFIRMED: "Josie: The Most Hated Woman In Britain" will air on Thursday 22nd January at 10pm on Channel 4. #JosieCunningham'

Miss Cunningham retweeted the message to her 70,000 followers on the social network, sparking a mixture of anger from critics and joy among fans.

While some of her followers replied 'love you Josie' and 'I'll be watching', another posted: 'Not paying my tv license again if they put that moose on my box!'

Website user Mark Bedford added: 'You must be so proud. Parading round a bargain basement Katie Price for ridicule like some Victorian freak show. Well done.'

Despite agent Mr Cooper's claim, a spokesman for Channel 4 said the schedule has not yet been finalised and the show was not therefore confirmed.

Cunningham's agent revealed the news on Twitter, with what he claims is the time and date it will air

It came after Miss Cunningham announced her engagement to Andrew Goy by sharing a photo of her pink heart-shaped engagement ring online.

The engagement, which was then confirmed by a representative for Miss Cunningham, comes just weeks after the couple were first pictured in Leeds city centre.

There have also been reports that Miss Cunningham is pregnant with Goy's child.

Last week, Miss Cunningham revealed she had wrongly told one man that he was the father of her three-month-old daughter by sending him the wrong DNA result.

She had asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day.

But the mother-of-three mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man.

Miss Cunningham shared her blunder with her Twitter followers before comparing her life to an episode of EastEnders.

Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

The mother-of-three later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

The former escort made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public.

She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation.

She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’.

It came after the wannabe glamour model, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night escort girl, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for.

As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice'

Earlier this month, the mother-of-three stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job.

Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery.

Using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her.

The mother-of-two had earlier spoken of her devastation when doctors told her she was having a third boy.

She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'.

Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000.

It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink.

But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl.
