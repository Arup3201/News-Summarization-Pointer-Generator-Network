Scrumhalf Rory Kockott has been called into the France squad to face Fiji, Australia and Argentina next month.

The South African qualifies to play for his adopted nation through residency rules, the French federation said on Sunday.

Castres Olympique player Kockott has been on Philippe Saint-Andre's radar for some time as the France coach regularly tinkers with his halfback line.

Rory Kockott of Castres is tackled by Harlequins' Mike Brown in the European Rugby Champions Cup on Friday, with the South African scrumhalf having been called into the France squad

International Rugby Board (IRB) eligibility rules state that a player can play for a country he was born in, one parent or grandparent was born in or in which he has completed '36 consecutive months of residence immediately preceding the time of playing'. Kockott has lived in France for over three years.

Another foreign player, New Zealander prop Uini Atonio, also features in the 30-man squad.

France will take on Fiji in Marseille on November 8 before taking on Australia at the Stade de France a week later and Argentina on November 22 also in Saint Denis.
