Police in Rotterdam are tightening security and drafting in reinforcements ahead of a highly charged second leg of the Europa League match between Feyenoord and Roma.

Feyenoord fans rioted in Rome before the first leg last week, damaging a recently renovated fountain, and leaving part of the city's historic center strewn with beer cans and smashed bottles.

Fearing that visiting Roma fans may want to take revenge before Thursday's return leg, Rotterdam police spokesman Gijs van Nimwegen said on Wednesday officers will, if necessary, be given emergency powers to eject trouble-making fans from the city.

Meanwhile, Dutch authorities say they are supporting private fundraising initiatives aiming to help pay for the repair of the 400-year-old Fountain of the Barcaccia that was damaged last week in Rome. 

The damage to the Baroque fountain by Pietro Bernini, a sculptor responsible for many of Rome's greatest works, was serious, Anna Maria Ceroni, a local official responsible for restorations, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper.

'The extent of the damage still needs to be determined, but it's permanent,' she said.

Mayor Ignazio Marino told La Repubblica daily: 'These crooks, these fake fans, hardened hooligans' had 'violated, dirtied and damaged' the fountain.

Feyenoord's general director, Eric Gudde, said he was ashamed by the 'behaviour of a group of brainless people who Feyenoord distances itself from completely and who fill every normal thinking Dutch person with horror'.

The Dutch embassy pledged to cooperate with Italy to catch the perpetrators.

'I am furious,' retired shop owner Iola Commandini said in Rome's Spanish Square where the fountain is located. 'They haven't come back today to look at what they have done because they are afraid they'll get beaten up.'

Some Italian politicians said  UEFA should exclude Feyenoord from the Europa League.

Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said Italian authorities would look into whether they had responded correctly, but placed the blame for the incident squarely on the 'barbarians'.

The match at Roma's Stadio Olimpico ended in a 1-1 draw.
