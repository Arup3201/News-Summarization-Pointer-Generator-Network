A captive penguin was left out in the cold after he managed to escape from its enclosure, then decided he wanted to get back inside again.

The flightless bird apparently built up enough speed in the pool at SeaWorld Orlando, Florida, to leap from the waters and over a barrier to bring himself face to face with tourists.

But finding himself among the guests gawking at the new Antartica: Empire Of The Penguin attraction seemed to much for the penguin, who first tried to flee then vainly tried to jump back into the pool.

I'm out! Now what? A penguin wonders what to do
next after leaping from his enclosure into the midst of visitors at a 
new exhibit at SeaWorld Orlando in Florida

Uh oh, here comes the screws: SeaWorld security moves in quickly to keep the escapee apart from visitors

I'm outta here: The flightless marine bird tries to make a getaway while the security man's back is turned

Coming back: He apparently thinks better of trying to escape and returns to where he leapt from the pool

Scared: As two security men form a human barrier, the penguin desperately tries to leap back IN to captivity

Rescue: Finally a handler appears, grabs the penguin and flings him back into the pool with his friends

The incident was caught on camera by a visitor.

The video shows the penguin staring forlornly back into the tank he has just leapt from at his pals who are still inside.

SeaWorld security rushed to surround the bird and keep him apart from tourists, but the bird has other ideas and tries to quickly waddle off to find another route back into captivity.

Guards have to rush to shepherd him back.

'I hope he's not hurt,' a woman visitor is heard saying in the background. 'He fell pretty hard.'

Eventually a wildlife expert arrives on the scene, picks up the bird, and drops him back into the pool.
