Vice President Joe Biden will meet Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov this weekend to try to spark new U.S.-Russia talks over reducing their countries' nuclear arsenals.

The meeting will take place in Munich, Germany, before National Security Advisor Tom Donilon travels to Moscow for a second round of talks next month.

It comes after years of tension between the U.S. and Russia that has included President Vladimir Putin accusing the 
U.S. of meddling in his country's politics.

Obama also made unfavourable headlines at his last meeting
with Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev in March at a nuclear security summit in South Korea.

The President was overheard saying he would have more 'flexibility' to work 
with Russia on missile defence after the U.S. presidential election.

Seizing on the comments, 43 Republican 
senators sent a letter to the president saying any concessions to the 
Russians would run counter to U.S. safety and security, and contradict 
assurances Obama gave the Senate when he secured ratification of the New
START arms reduction treaty in December 2010.

Russian fears of new U.S. missiles at 
its doorstep in Europe have also helped to prevent further progress on nuclear
arms reductions after the breakthrough New Start agreement three years ago.

In an interview last week, Medvedev explained that Obama was signaling he would have more negotiating power on these subjects, but said that the two countries were still quite far apart.

'Any U.S. President during his second term can take a stronger position and act in a more decisive manner, and that is exactly what Barack meant,' Medvedev said.

'But if we talk about the subject 
itself, it is extremely difficult, and so far we don't see any 
flexibility. There are no easy solutions in terms of anti-missile 
defense. There is no flexibility.

'We have not changed our previous 
positions. The U.S. has one opinion, and the Russian Federation, 
unfortunately, has a different opinion. These positions are not getting 
any closer.'

Four years ago Biden spoke of the Obama administration's desire  'reset' U.S.-Russian relations after years of deterioration during the George W. Bush presidency.

Republicans fear the upcoming meetings with Russian leaders will propose unilateral reductions in U.S. nuclear stockpiles or alterations to U.S. missile-defence plans as an enticement for Russia to sit down for new talks.

In February 2011 the U.S. and Russia finalised a landmark arms treaty to limit the nuclear arsenals of the former Cold War foes.

The New START treaty limits each side to 1,550 strategic warheads, down from 2,200 and re-established a monitoring system that ended in 2009.

The agreement, a cornerstone of Barack Obama's efforts to 'reset' US relations with Russia, came into effect as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton exchanged ratification papers with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in Munich.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed it as a 'milestone on the road to our ultimate goal: achieving a world free of nuclear weapons'.

The seven-year New START treaty was the first major revamping of nuclear disarmament 
deals since the late Cold War era.

It was approved by the U.S. Senate in 
December 2010 after a bruising fight during which Obama pressed strongly for 
its passage. Russia ratified the deal the following month.

The Cable reported that in a letter to Biden Republican Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee,
said: 'Ahead of your unannounced discussions with Russian Foreign 
Minister Lavrov this weekend in Munich, and prior to Mr Donilon's 
forthcoming February discussions in Moscow, I write seeking your 
assurance as to President Obama's plans for future potential U.S. arms 
reductions.'

Rogers and other Republicans are worried 
that the Obama administration may not pursue a new treaty, but instead 
strike a deal with Russia that won't have to be approved by Congress.

Donilon intends to transmit a personal letter to Putin from Obama 'articulating his plans for further U.S. arms reductions and perhaps even agreements about U.S. missile defenses to entice Russia to the negotiating table,' Rogers wrote, according to The Cable.

The State Department's International Security Advisory Board (ISAB), which reports to acting Under Secretary for Arms Control Rose Gottemoeller, issued a report last November spelling out how further nuclear reductions might be achieved, with or without the cooperation of the Senate or the Russians.

The ISAB presented options for three scenarios: 'completing the New START Treaty reductions early; working with Russia on transparency and verification of nonstrategic nuclear weapons; and engaging in parallel nuclear arms reductions to levels below New START, if Russia is willing to reciprocate.'

'Unilateral and coordinated reductions can be quicker and less politically costly ... relative to treaties with adversarial negotiations and difficult ratification processes,' the report stated.

Administration critics are already preparing to fight any attempt by the White House to push forward with nuclear reductions absent the consent of the Senate.

'Senators should block end-runs around the Constitution's treaty clause,' wrote Bush administration officials John Bolton and John Yoo in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last month.

'An informal agreement would prevent effective congressional scrutiny of the unwise rush to slash the nuclear arsenal, America's ultimate national-security safeguard and a crucial buttress of world peace.'
