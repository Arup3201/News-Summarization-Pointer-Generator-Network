A Coastguard spokesman said: 'It is not clear at this time how many people are involved and if there are any injuries. A search and rescue operation is ongoing.'

Some 97 sailors were thrown from boats into the lough as they took part in the regatta, the Boating World Championships GP 14 event, off Killyleagh.

The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust in Northern Ireland said ambulance crews were treating as many people as possible at the scene and a major incident response plan has been launched.

'There were 97 people in the water,' the spokeswoman said.

'Casualties will be being brought to the Ulster Hospital (Dundonald). A major incident and emergency response plan is in operation.'

Strangford Lough is an area affected by powerful tides from the sea. It is a short distance south west of Belfast in Co Down.

It is popular with all sorts of watersports enthusiasts and a dedicated canoe trail has been laid out along its waters.
