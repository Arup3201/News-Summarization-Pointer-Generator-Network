A former railway ticket office converted into a 'genuinely one-off' home has gone on the market - for £200,000. 

Potential buyers have been making tracks to the historic house in Scotland where passengers once paid their fares to use the Denburn Valley line.

Estate agents are marketing the old station house on Aberdeen's Hutcheon Street as a 'unique' opportunity - and have reported 'significant interest'.

The red-brick station house, pictured, on Aberdeen's Hutcheon Street, was put up for sale with an asking price of more than £200,000

The two-storey, red-brick building sold tickets to passengers on the Denburn Valley Line from 1887 until 1937, when the line was discontinued

The two-storey, red-brick building sold tickets to passengers on the Denburn Valley Line from 1887 until 1937, when the line was discontinued.

Since then it has had a varied history acting as a drum shop and blade sharpening business before being converted into a house in 1999.

Current owner Richard Cowie, 56, has decided to sell his home as he prepares for retirement.

He said: 'I'll be sorry to leave this place. It's so unique.

First class: The station ticket office has already attracted plenty of interest after it was put on the market by its current owners

The Denburn line carried commuters from Aberdeen's suburbs into the city's factories but was closed in the late 30s as tram and bus services improved

'I moved here about four years ago and this place has just had such a terrific old-fashioned feel to it.

'I'm hoping to retire soon though and I need a place with a garage to keep me occupied.'

Offshore worker Mr Cowie added that the red brick house was well known in granite grey Aberdeen.

All change: The building has converted in to a house in 1999

Estate agents have described the old ticket office as a 'charming and unique accommodation across two floors'

He said: 'I like the granite but everybody locally knows my house - even if they don't realise that it is a house.

'It does stand out from the surroundings. It's a red brick cottage in a street full of granite tenements.

'I think that is what has interested a lot of people in it. There have been significant numbers of people coming to view it in the last few days.

'I bought it because I needed somewhere smaller after my kids grew up and flew the nest, I didn't really think too hard about the history first.

Original features: The property retains some reminders of its past use as a ticket office

Standing-out: The building is well known in and around Aberdeen

'"Quaint" is a word that's come up a lot with the viewers and they all comment on how much bigger it is on the inside.

'People think it's going to be much smaller until they open the door and it opens out, like Dr. Who's TARDIS.

'It's all been positive so far.'

Agents Simpson and Marwick said: 'This is a genuinely one-off property, in ready-to-move into order.

'Exhibited throughout in first class order, it offers charming and unique accommodation across two floors, and its neutral presentation is an added appeal.'
