Craig Whyte is facing jail after a second warrant for the arrest of the former Rangers owner was issued by a High Court judge.

The businessman, already wanted by Police Scotland for questioning concerning his 2011 takeover of the club, was due to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice in London where Ticketus are pursuing a separate action over his role in the Ibrox meltdown.

Mr Justice Newey charged Whyte with contempt of court after he failed to appear for the hearing – with a custodial order of 28 days attached to the warrant.

Earlier this week the Motherwell-born financier vowed to surrender to police and assist officers investigating the Rangers takeover, saying: ‘I will return to Britain at the beginning of December and hand myself in for questioning.’

If he does come back, Whyte will now be arrested and faces a potential four-week custodial sentence.

Following the hearing a spokeswoman for Ticketus said: ‘Today’s court hearing is part of Ticketus’ continued activity to enforce its judgement of April 2013 for damages of £17.7million plus interest and costs against Craig Whyte as it looks to recover funds for its investors.

‘This reflects the total amount Ticketus invested through the ticket purchase agreement it entered into with Rangers Football Club under Craig Whyte’s ownership.

‘Ticketus confirms that the court today issued a warrant for Craig Whyte’s arrest, having previously issued a suspended committal order on 29 September returnable today after finding Craig Whyte to be guilty of contempt of court.’

The warrant is separate to that issued last week in relation to Whyte’s takeover of Rangers. Four other men – three of whom worked for the club’s administrators Duff and Phelps - appeared in court this week over the allegedly fraudulent takeover. All four were granted bail ahead of a future hearing.

Meanwhile, the war of words between Rangers Football Board chairman Sandy Easdale and former director Dave King continued on Thursday.

King claims Easdale sought assurances he wouldn’t be forced out of Ibrox if the South African-based businessman’s consortium gained power last month.

‘The truth is, when I spoke to Sandy on my recent trip to Scotland his main concern was whether, after investment by our consortium, he would still be able to stay involved with the club,’ claimed King.

‘He indicated that Mike Ashley would look after him if he assisted Ashley in protecting his commercial rights.

‘The new investment proposed by Paul (Murray), George (Letham) and I was seen as a threat to Sports Direct’s desire to extend its influence over the Rangers brand in all its forms.

‘After discussions with Paul and George I confirmed by email to Sandy that we had no immediate intention to remove him or his brother from board involvement at Rangers.

‘This concession was clearly not enough to gain his support and the board approved the inferior offer presented by Ashley.

‘Furthermore, in my meeting with the Rangers board, I confirmed that I could give proof of funds within 24 hours of the board accepting our proposal in principle. I was never asked to do this.’

Whyte has said that he will return to Britain in early December and hand himself over to the authorities

Easdale, who claimed on Wednesday he was ‘tired of Mr King’s antics’, refuted that claim through a statement from spokesman Jack Irvine which read: ‘There has been no discussion between Mr Easdale with Mr King on the matters mentioned in his latest statement.

‘If Mr King has any proof of such a conversation and when and where they took place he should produce it.

‘If he is suggesting any improper conduct or motive he should make his position clear.

‘Anybody who knows Mr Easdale would find it risible that he would have adopted such a subservient tone with Mr King.’
