A parrot who was rescued from a meth house is slowly recovering after living in close proximity to the toxic chemicals caused all her feathers to fall out.

The parrot called Lollibaby was discovered by officials at a drug lab home that they raided in Morgan County last month.

She is now on the road to recovery at the One Stop Pet Shop in Rockwood, Tennessee.

It appears that Lollibaby's feathers have fallen out due to the methamphetamine being cooked at the home - a very visual sign of the dangers of the volatile drug.

For every part of meth that is made, five parts of toxic waste are left behind, according to experts at Susquehanna Valley Center.

The
toxins in the chemical formula used to cook the addictive 
drug are known to cause hair loss and 'meth-mouth', the loss of teeth.

Many
meth users claw at their skin until they are covered in bleeding, open 
sores as the drug can cause a sensation that is describe like bugs 
crawling under the skin.

Meth also leads to risk of long-term depression, brain damage, strokes, cardiac arrest and ultimately, death.

Meth, known as 'poor man's cocaine', is cooked in makeshift labs that can be set up at home.

The drug is made with a mixture of household ingredients and takes a heavy toll on the health, with both psychological and physical deterioration in users.

Living in a home with a meth lab, or even nearby, is even more damaging to children and pets because their bodies have smaller masses to absorb toxins.

Joseph Clapp, who works at the pet store, told WBIR: 'We're trying to get her back to health.

'It's going to be six to eight months, and it may take longer than that because we're just not sure.'

He added: 'Imagine what [meth] does to children, and [with] birds and animals, it can still have an effect.'

Lollibaby is making daily improvements, according to the pet store who are fundraising for her long-term care. The pet bird will not be put up for adoption.

Employees at the store say the cockatoo's appetite is getting better by the day and they have moved her to a larger cage.

Tennessee has among the highest number of meth lab seizures in the U.S. It was the first state in the U.S. to create a meth offender registry.Â
