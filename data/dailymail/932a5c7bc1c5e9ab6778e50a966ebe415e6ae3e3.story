The U.S. military has begun testing troops to see if using low level shocks of electricity keeps them alert when they are in combat.

The Pentagon reportedly feels coffee and energy drinks are not enough to keep soldiers' minds from drifting.

Early experiments are underway using 'noninvasive' brain stimulation on dozens of volunteers - who seemed to perform better as a result.

The U.S. military has begun testing troops to see if using low level shocks of electricity keep them alert during combat. Early experiments are underway using 'noninvasive' treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, stock image pictured, on volunteers who reported increased performance as a result

The research carried out by the U.S military focused on two transcranial
techniques.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) involves passing an electric current to the brain via a magnetic field.

Transcranial direct 
current stimulation is where the current is passed directly into the brain using sensors attached to the head.

In each case, a very small dose - approximately one milliampere - was used on each participant for 10 minutes at a time.

The
 tests were designed to check for alertness and general performance; one
 involved participants following instructions on a screen to spot 
an aircraft as it came into friendly airspace.

The Boston Globe reported that Lindsey McIntire, one of the researchers, said the response was better than caffeine and without the side effects like jitters or palpitations.

This appeared to be the case when subjects were kept awake for 30 hours, or longer than a full day.

There was also no ‘crash’ after a few hours, unlike when the effects of caffeine wear off.

The study has been carried out at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

The team behind it hope that in the near future soldiers will carry a pair of electrodes with them that they can easily apply to themselves to carry the electric current.

They were commissioned due to the changing nature of warfare; troops on the front line have adrenalin to keep them going but those sifting through reams of intelligence data need something to keep them sharp too.

The U.S. military has a long and 
chequered history when it comes to altering the minds of soldiers in a 
bid to make them more effective killing machines

In the 1960s men were given LSD at Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland to see if could be used as a weapon of war.

Other test subjects were exposed to mustard gas, nerve agent VX and other potentially fatal chemicals.

In
 1994 the Wright Laboratory in Ohio, another U.S. Air Force facility, drew
 up a paper proposing the idea of a ‘gay bomb’ which would flood an
 area with hormones and turn enemy soldiers into homosexuals with an 
increased libido.

The research focused on two techniques, transcranial magnetic stimulation, in which a magnetic field passes an electric current to the brain, and transcranial direct current stimulation, where it is passed directly into the brain.

A very small dose - around one milliampere - was used on each participant for 10 minutes at a time.

The tests were designed to check for alertness and general performance; one involved participants following instructions on a screen to spot an aircraft as it came into friendly airspace.

Staff Sergeant William Raybon, who took part, said he felt a ‘tingling’ when he was first hooked up to the electrodes but was ‘refreshed’ afterwards.

The Boston Globe reported that overall, those who did not get any brain stimulation, including coffee, 'performed significantly worse than any of the stimulation groups.'

As to the difference between caffeine and the electricity, the latter seemed to be more effective.

R. Andy McKinley, a biomedical engineer who oversees the research, said: 'We found that people who receive the stimulation are performing consistently.'

Dr William Killgore, an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School, added: ‘There is some evidence that it does seem to work. There have been a few studies that if you use it in the right place it can help mathematical calculations when people are sleep-deprived.’
