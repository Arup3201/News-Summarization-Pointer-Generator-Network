Manchester City and England goalkeeper Joe Hart hopes to sign a new four-and-a-half year contract before he travels to Italy on Tuesday for their make-or-break Champions League clash against Roma the following night.

Details of the deal, which could be worth up to £165,000 a week, have been agreed between the Premier League champions and their longest-serving player.

Both sets of lawyers are now giving the documents a final check in the hope it can be announced before the club’s big European clash.

Joe Hart is hoping to sign a new four-and-a-half year contract with Manchester City very soon 

The contract propels Hart into the group of higher earners at City alongside the likes of David Silva and ties him down to playing at The Etihad until the summer of 2019.

With bonuses and image rights, it could more than double his current wages of £80,000 a week.

Hart, 27, joined City from Shrewsbury for a bargain £600,000 in 2006 when Stuart Pearce was manager.

Hart pulled off an outstanding save to deny Romelu Lukaku as City hung on to clinch a 1-0 win over Everton 

He has gone on to win two Premier League titles and the FA Cup and established himself as England’s first-choice goalkeeper, posting 26 clean sheets in 48 appearances for his country.

City need to beat Roma to progress to the knockout stages of the Champions League, provided CSKA Moscow don’t win away to Bayern Munich, or gain a score draw and hope CSKA lose.

Hart (let), in action against Uruguay during the World Cup in Brazil, has kept 26 clean sheets for England
