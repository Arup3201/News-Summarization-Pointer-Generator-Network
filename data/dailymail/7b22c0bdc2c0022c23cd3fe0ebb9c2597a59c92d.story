For anyone heading home for Christmas, carrying bags overflowing with presents often means a nightmare journey. 

In an attempt to ease the inevitable festive sardines situation, Virgin Trains has introduced a delivery service called Bag Magic.

The initiative - costing from £9.99 per bag one-way - allows passengers to send luggage and gifts to a UK destination overnight by courier, so they can enjoy their journey without the burden of baggage.

The Bag Magic team, working with Parcels 4 Delivery, will collect bags, cases, presents, and even bicycles from home, an office or a hotel and deliver them next day or on a pre-booked date in the future to the passenger's address of choice.

To promote the service in the lead up to Christmas, Virgin Trains has employed elves to wrap presents for free at London's Euston station on November 22 and 23. 

The bags containing the gifts will then be delivered anywhere in the country on November 25 by the Bag Magic team.

Steve Tennant, Customer Experience Director at Virgin Trains said: 'We're always looking for ways to make our customers' journeys more relaxing, especially the final train home before Christmas when you're carrying those mountains of presents for loved ones. 

'Bag Magic means you can send your luggage ahead to make your journey as simple and enjoyable as a sleigh ride.

Happy to help: The elves will also wrap presents for free at London's Euston station this weekend (Nov 22-23)

'Christmas is a time when people's bags are bigger than ever, and we know that whilst some people have the gift of neat wrapping others aren't quite so deft. 

'The Virgin Trains elves will have your presents looking perfect and now with Bag Magic you can send everything ahead whilst you sit back and relax, dreaming of a white Christmas.'
