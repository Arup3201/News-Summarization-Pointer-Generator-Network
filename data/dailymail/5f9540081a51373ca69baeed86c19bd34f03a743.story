A new study has revealed there are a total of just 93 women mentioned in the Bible - and they speak only 1.1 per cent of the time.

Reverend Lindsay Hardin Freeman led a three-year search of the Bible's New Revised Standard Version to count every single word spoken by females.

Along with her dedicated team of three volunteer helpers, they discovered that of the 93 women, only 49 were named - and together they spoke a grand total of 14,056 words.

Rev. Freeman said: 'We were stunned nobody had done this before. I wanted to know what women in the Bible really said.

'We found that all these books looked at what women did, but not what the women said. We wanted to hold up their words, and bring them to life.'

The women met and studied the book in the Trinity Episcopal Church in Excelsior, Minnesota, where Freeman was serving as rector when the research started.

Their painstaking study revealed that Mary, the mother of Jesus, speaks just 191 words, while Mary Magdalene says only 61 words and Sarah, the wife of Abraham, is attributed with 141 words.

Meanwhile, Eve - perhaps the Bible's best-known woman - speaks only 74 words, and Judith, from the Book of Judith, has the most words spoken with a grand total of 2,689 

An unnamed Samaritan woman, who has the longest recorded conversation with Jesus in the Bible, speaks a total of just 151 words.

It is estimated that the Bible contains around 1.1 million words in total.

Rev. Freeman said many of the females endured 'tremendous trauma' in the book and said: 'We are just finally finding out their stories.' 

She told the Huffington Post: 'We have for whatever reason overlooked the witness of women in the Bible for all these thousands of years and all the contributions they've made to the faith and to world history.  

'We have cried over these stories, we have laughed over these stories. Our faith has been increased.'

The Bible does contain references to when women should be allowed to speak, and one interpretation of 1 Corinthians, suggests Paul wrote that women "should remain silent" while in church.

Rev. Freeman is an expert on the subject of female roles in the Holy Book and is also the author of 'The Scarlet Cord: Conversations With God's Chosen Women' which studied the stories of 12 women in the Bible. 

Their findings have been published in a book called 'Bible Women: All Their Words and Why They Matter'.
