Police were embroiled in a row today after they allowed an Olympic star to fire a Taser for a publicity stunt.

Officers were accused of breaking the law by allowing hockey player Sally Walton to blast a tin-foil target with the fearsome 50,000 volt weapon.

The resulting footage and photographs were proudly placed on West Midlands Police’s website to promote its work with women officers.

But they were hurriedly removed after police chiefs learned of the stunt amid fears that their staff had broken the law.

Taser stun guns are classified as a firearm and it is illegal for anyone to possess one unless they are a police officer or ‘Crown servant’.

Tough laws designed to prevent the spread of potentially lethal weapons mean anyone caught with a firearm faces a minimum five year jail sentence.

One critic said he was 'astonished' that a celebrity had been allowed to fire a Taser and said police may well have broken the law.

Richard Taylor, a Cambridge-based campaigner who has examined the use of the weapons, suggested police are becoming 'complacent' about their use.

He said: 'Strict safeguards are in place which ought to control the police use of weapons.

'Police officers need to be authorised to carry Taser weapons, members of the public shouldn't be getting their hands on them under any circumstances.'

But West Midlands Police dispute that Miss Walton broke the law as she was ‘fully supervised’ when she used the gun.

The incident came amid mounting concern about the increased use of Taser weapons by police officers across the country.

Many forces are ramping up the number of officers allowed to use them and investing in extra equipment claiming it will make police and the public safer.

But critics have expressed fears that the weapons are being used inappropriately and in trivial confrontations that could be resolved without force.

The Daily Mail has revealed how 
prisoners have been Tasered for refusing to remove their underwear and 
several cyclists have also been shot.

Walton, a member of Team GB’s bronze medal winning hockey team, joined 
police officers for a training day at an training indoor centre.

She swapped her hockey stick for a baton as she confronted violent ‘criminals’, smashed a door down and was petrol bombed during a mock riot.

The 28-year-old was also filmed as she examined and fired a live Taser weapon, of the same kind worn by officers on the streets.

Referring to the red laser dot sight, a burly instructor tells her to ‘take the safety off and then you can light someone up’.

Sparks can then be seen as she discharges a five second burst of electricity into a tin-foil target in the shape of a person.

Under the Firearms Act 1968 a Taser is defined as a prohibited weapon, alongside other stun guns and CS gas canisters.

It states that a Taser can only be possessed by someone ‘authorised by the Secretary of State’, in this case Home Secretary Teresa May.

The only exemptions are the police or ‘other persons in the service of the Crown’, for example personnel in the Armed Forces.

Anyone found with an unauthorised firearm faces a minimum five year jail sentence, except in exceptional circumstances.

Experts said the question of whether Miss Walton has committed a crime is a ‘grey area’ and it is extremely unlikely she would be prosecuted.

This is because the definition of ‘possessing’ the weapon is ambiguous and because she was on police premises and under close supervision at the time.

Speaking afterwards she said: ‘I 
think it helped, obviously accuracy is massive in my sport … it was 
useful and it was good to transfer my skills into this.’

Miss Walton, who lives in Solihull, posted pictures of her brandishing and firing the Taser on her personal Facebook page.

She later wrote on Twitter that she ‘enjoyed every minute of it’ and offered her services to her local police team.

But West Midlands Police quickly changed its publicity photographs and video to remove all references to the Taser.

Mr Taylor added: 'I don't think we should be glamorising police use of Tasers or firearms.

'Use of force by the police must be proportionate and a last resort.

'I want to continue to live in a country where the police are largely unarmed and proud of their restraint when it comes to using the weapons they do have available to them.

'I think showing off their Tasers in celebrity videos would be completely at odds with the culture of policing we have, and which I would like to see maintained.'

Assistant Chief Constable Garry Forsyth said: ‘West Midlands Police was happy to host local Olympian Sally Walton at a recent public order training event to demonstrate the rigorous training that officers undergo in order to carry out their varied range of duties.

‘During this time, Sally was given the opportunity to use a Taser whilst being carefully guided and directed by a highly-trained Taser instructor in a safe, controlled environment.

‘At all times Sally was wearing protective equipment and fully supervised by a specialist instructor.

‘Sally used the firearm in a safe, controlled environment at the discretion of the officers on the day we do not accept that it was an ‘illegal’ use.’

The Home Office confirmed that West Midlands Police did not obtain any special dispensation to allow Miss Walton to use the weapon.

A spokesman said under the Firearms Act Tasers can only be possessed by someone authorised by the Secretary of State, except police and people ‘in the service of the Crown’.

Miss Walton said: ‘It was a privilege to join West Midlands Police for the day and showcase the work carried out by officers.’

The hockey player made her international debut in 2005 and has gone on to win more than 100 caps for England and Great Britain.

The defender was part of the womens’ field hockey team who beat New Zealand 3-1 to claim bronze at the London Olympics.
