Google has filed a patent that could let users unlock their smartphones and tablets using facial expressions rather than typing in passwords. 

The latest Google Android devices already have a built-in Face Unlock feature that uses facial recognition to unlock their handsets, but this patent would take the technology a step further adding additional 'liveness' features.

When Google launched Face Unlock in 2011, as part of Android Ice Cream Sandwich, it was criticised by security experts because it could be bypassed by holding static photos up to the phone or tablet's camera.

If a patent filed by Google is approved, it could mean users would be able to unlock their smartphones by pulling faces such as frowning, smiling, poking out their tongue, wrinkling their nose, blinking and so on. The technology would compare the facial expression pulled with a previously captured photo and if the expressions matched, the user would be allowed access to their device

In the update to Android Jelly Bean  in July 2012, Google added a 'liveness' check in an attempt to prevent these static images being used to gain access to devices. 

This meant a user would have to blink while using Face Unlock to prove they were alive.

However, even this could be bypassed using clever photo editing tricks.

According to Google's latest U.S patent, the new system would require users to pull a specific, predeterminded facial expression.

To get access to a device the user would have to pull a specific predeterminded facial expression. 

The expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user's identity.

Facial expressions listed include blinking, frowning, smiling, sticking out a tongue, wrinkling a nose and raising an eyebrow.

The patent explains there would be a 
small margin of error but the user's expression would have to match the 
original photo as closely as possible.

The technology would then check for 'liveness' - a signal that shows the user is alive and moving and not a static image.

It would scan for changes in pixels and light to monitor and recognise the changes in the location of the facial features.

For example, if a blink is used to gain access the 
technology would record the light from the eye and then monitor if this 
light changes, suggesting the eye has been closed.

This 'live' movement is then given a score based on how similar it is to the original image.

If the score reaches the minimum security threshold, the phone is unlocked. If it doesn't the user is denied access and has to try again.

The expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user's identity.

The patent said: 'The anti-spoofing techniques herein may use 
facial gestures such as blinks, 
winks, and other gestures that may be performed within the confines of a
 human face.

'[The device] may detect facial gestures associated 
with various facial features.

Examples include one or both eyes (e.g., 
for blinks, winks, etc.), the mouth area (e.g., for gestures including 
smiling, frowning, displaying a user's teeth, extending a user's tongue,
 etc.), the nose (e.g., for a nose wrinkle gesture, etc.), the forehead 
(e.g., for a forehead wrinkle gesture, etc.), one or both eyebrows (for 
eyebrow raise and compression gestures, etc.), and various others.'

Google already lets its users enable two-step verification for their online accounts, and offers Face Unlock on Android. With Face Unlock, pictured, Android users can use their face to unlock their smartphone or tablet, in place of a PIN or a pattern

The patent explains there would be a small margin of error but the user's expression would have to match the original photo as closely as possible.

A chart in the patent shows that the technology would capture the first facial image and compare it to the photo on file.

It would then check for 'liveness'.

According to the patent: 'In the example of the 
blink gesture, corresponding pixel locations of the 
first and second sub-images may represent portions of the corneas and 
the eyelids, respectively.

'Additionally, the eyelids may include less 
pixel transitions than the corneas.

'More specifically, a cornea may 
display pixel transitions (e.g., contrasting colors) with respect to two
 or more of the sclera, iris, and pupil.

Images in the Google's patent, pictured, filed to the U.S Patent and Trademark Office, show that the technology scans the eyes and other features for changes in pixels and light fluctuations. These changes can be used to track movement. If the changes caused by the facial expression don't match the photo on file the user will be denied access to their device

'Conversely, an eyelid may 
display pixel transitions only at its upper bound (relative to the 
eyebrow) and lower bound (relative to the eyelash).'

This means the device would check for the location of light and pixels relative to a person's face and their facial features.

If a blink is used to gain access, for example, the technology would record the light from the eye and then monitor if this light changes, suggesting the eye had been closed.

Google added a 'liveness' check feature to Android Jelly Bean. This means users have to blink when using Face Unlock to prove they are not a photo in order to get access to their device

This 'live' movement is then given a score based on how similar it is to the original image.

If the score reaches the minimum security threshold, the phone is unlocked.

If it doesn't the user is denied access and has to try again.

The patent doesn't explain how many times a user can try to access the device before it is permanently locked, not does it say if there is a failsafe technique if the user can't get in.

The patent is still waiting for approval and Google declined to comment on the plans, including when its likely to be available if it gets approval.

Motorola announced in May it was also looking at alternatives to the traditional passwords using physical authentication.

Among the ideas discussed at the D11 
conference in California were electronic tattoos and 
pills that people swallow.

The
 tattoos, developed by Massachusetts-based engineering firm MC10, 
contain flexible electronic circuits that are attached to the wearer's 
skin using a rubber stamp.

Motorola 
claimed that the circuits, which also contain antennae and built-in 
sensors, could be adapted to work with mobile phones and tablets.

This image shows the various parts that make up the MC10 electronic tattoo called the Biostamp. It can be stuck to the body using a rubber stamp, and protected using spray-on bandages. The circuit can be worn for two weeks and Motorola believes this makes it perfect for authentication purposes

The mobile devices could then be used to confirm the owner's identity and log them in to accounts automatically.

Another idea presented during the keynote talk at the Wall Street Journal conference with head of Motorola Dennis Woodside and 
senior vice president for advanced technology and products, Regina Dugan, was a swallowable pill.

The Proteus Digital Health pill has 
already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration and was given European regulatory approval in 2010.

It contains a computer chip that can be powered like a battery using the acid in the wearer's stomach.

Once
 swallowed the 'vitamin authentication pill' creates an 18-bit ECG-like 
signal inside the wearer's body that can be picked up by mobile devices 
and authentication hardware outside.

This could be used verify the wearer is the correct owner of the device or account.

A similar idea teased by Motorola during talk last year was a swallowable pill (picutred). It contains a computer chip powered like a battery using the acid in the wearer's stomach. Once swallowed the 'vitamin authentication pill' creates an 18-bit ECG-like signal that can be picked up by mobile devices
