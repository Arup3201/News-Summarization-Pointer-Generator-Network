A woman claims to have been bitten by a bull shark after falling into a canal on the Gold Coast at the weekend.

Bianca Freeman, 29, posted photos of her wounds to social media on Saturday saying they were inflicted by a shark in the canals between Surfers and Chevron Island.

Ms Freeman said she was drinking with friends at 9.30pm on Saturday when she slipped off a dock and fell into the water.

Bianca Freeman required 20 stitches after she was bitten by a bull shark on the Gold Coast at the weekend

A bull shark latched onto her thigh within seconds and took a large bite out of her leg.

The 29-year-old said she was drinking with friends at 9.30pm on Saturday when she slipped off a dock and fell into the water

Ms Freeman was rushed via ambulance to a medical centre where it took 20 stitches to close up the wound, according to Nine News.

'(There was) so much blood, the outfit I was wearing was completely covered,' Ms Freeman said.

'I had socks on and they were completely red. It looked like something out of a horror movie.'

She posted two photos of her injuries to her Instagram account - one shows her thigh covered in stitches, while the other shows several bandages wrapped around her leg.

'Ever survived a shark attack? I have but my phone didn't!' she wrote alongside photos of her injuries.

While she joked about being 'shark bait', local emergency services don't have a record of any such attack.

'We are currently looking into it but we haven't come across a case like that yet,' a Queensland Ambulance Service spokeswoman told MailOnline.

'We would obviously know if someone responded to a shark attack.'
