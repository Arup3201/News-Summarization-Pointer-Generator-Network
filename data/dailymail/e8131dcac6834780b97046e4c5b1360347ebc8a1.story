Initiation: 19-year-old Esteban Sotelo was arrested Thursday after shooting a man in a gang initiation, while the victim shielded his toddler daughter from the barrage of bullets

A man was shot six times while shielding his toddler daughter in a gang-related shooting Thursday evening in Chicago.

The shooting happened in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago when 19-year-old Esteban 'Sniper' Sotelo and a 14-year-old shot the man as part of a gang initiation.

The 29-year-old victim had just left his mother's house with his wife and 20-month-old daughter.

He was in the middle of putting the toddler in her car seat when Sotelo and the minor approached him.

'What's up?' Sotelo asked before opening fire, shooting the man six times while he shielded his daughter from the barrage.

The gang members fled but were apprehended shortly after by Chicago Police officers.

They found the weapon used in the shooting in a bag of mulch.

Sotelo admitted in  Cook County Bond Court Sunday that the shooting was an initiation for the 14-year-old into the Latin Kings gang.

They believed the victim to be a member of rival gang Satan's Disciples.

Multiple witnesses have identified Sotelo as the gunman.

Sotelo is currently on probation for a felony cocaine-related conviction. His prior history includes delinquencies as a minor for robbery and aggravated battery.

The victim is being treated at Mt. Sinai hospital for wounds on his legs, back and neck, according to Assistant State's Attorney Heather Kent.

Kent also said that a round was lodged in the victim's nasal cavity below his eye

Sotelo was denied bail Sunday.
