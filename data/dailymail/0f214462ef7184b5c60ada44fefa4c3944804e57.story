Pop superstar Rihanna yesterday won a legal fight with Topshop after it used her face on a T-shirt without permission.

The singer claimed the item damaged her image because fans may have thought it was genuine merchandise.

Suing under her real name, Robyn Rihanna Fenty, she is asking for £3million damages from Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group Brands Ltd, which operates the clothing chain.

Dispute: Rihanna has won a battle with Topshop over a T-shirt bearing the picture of her face, seen left, which she claimed is similar to one of her album covers and could mislead fans into believing the item was 'genuine'

At London’s High Court, the judge Mr 
Justice Birss said the white T-shirt with a photograph of the star in a 
bra top was an act of ‘passing off’.

‘A substantial number of purchasers 
are likely to [have been] deceived into buying [the] T-shirt because of a
false belief that it has been authorised by Rihanna,’ he said.

The judge said it was damaging to her 
goodwill and represented a loss of control over her reputation in the 
‘fashion sphere’. Damages will be decided later.

The legal case against Topshop has 
come as a surprise to some, given Rihanna’s apparent friendship with 
Topshop tycoon Sir Philip.

Decision: Justice Birss sitting at the High Court said Topshop's sale of a Rihanna T-shirt at the centre of the dispute was an act of 'passing off'

The What’s My Name singer dined with 
the businessman and music mogul Simon Cowell during her Christmas break 
in Barbados in 2010.

She later tweeted: ‘Just had dinner w/ Simon Cowell Philip Green @ Sandy Lane! Great night!’

Rihanna has also spent time with Sir 
Philip’s daughter Chloe when they were on holiday at the same time in 
the Caribbean two years ago.

It was even rumoured the singer might follow in the footsteps of Kate Moss and design a range for Topshop.

Topshop has in the past released a 
T-shirt featuring a picture of Rihanna taken from the video for her hit 
We Found Love, which sold out quickly.

But despite the legal battle, the 
star’s entourage have continued to ask Topshop for clothes on her 
behalf, the court  was told.

Requests came on ‘ten recent 
occasions’, six of which were after Rihanna launched proceedings against
the retailer, said the company’s barrister, Geoffrey Hobbs QC.

Claims: Topshop was selling a T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of Rihanna's face she claims is 'very similar' to one of her album covers

Ex-Formula One driver Eddie Irvine successfully sued Talksport over its use of a photo of him in an advert which suggested he endorsed the radio station

Celebrities cannot easily exert control over the use of their face but Rihanna's victory might encourage more to try, an expert has said.

The singer successfully sued Topshop because she was able to convince the court it had created the impression the T-shirts had been endorsed by her.

Michael Gardner, head of the intellectual property team at London law firm Wedlake Bell, said: 'A number of fans would have mistakenly believed she had entered into a commercial deal with the company to sell the clothing.

'Although it is fashionable to talk about image rights, there is in fact no such legal right in existence under English law.  

'In other words, celebrities, sports personalities, film stars (or anyone else) cannot exert general control over the use of their likenesses. 

'They can only act to prevent the unauthorised use of their image in a particular case if the type falls within another area of law that does provide protection.  

'Examples are where they can use copyright law, the law of privacy or, as in the Rihanna case, "passing off"'.

'There must be a misrepresentation to the public that there has been a commercial link-up between the celebrity and the person selling or making that T-shirt.  

'People were more likely to think that such a garment must have been licensed or endorsed by the celebrity in question. 

'A number of fans would have mistakenly believed she had entered into a commercial deal with the company to sell the clothing'

Michael Gardner, Wedlake Bell law firm

'The photo was also similar to one of her album covers and this again suggested an "official" use rather than that the T-shirt was simply an independent work of fashion.' 

It is not the first time a celebrity has successfully sued in this way.

Ex-Formula One driver Eddie Irvine successfully sued Talksport over its use of a photo of him in an advert which suggested he endorsed the radio station.

Mr Gardner said: 'The fact the judge was persuaded to find in Rihanna's favour may give some encouragement to other celebrities.  

'This does not look to me to have been as clear a case as the Eddie Irvine one was.  

'Topshop clearly decided to run the case on the principle that they could use the Rihanna image in this way. 

'It turns out they could not. But this looks to have been a decision that could have gone either way.'
