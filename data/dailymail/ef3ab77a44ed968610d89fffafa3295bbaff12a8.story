Resignation: Cecil Rex Ard has stepped down as the mayor of Webb following his arrest last month

The mayor of a small Alabama town has quit after he was arrested as part of a massive prostitution sting last month.

Cecil Rex Ard, 69, the mayor of Webb, was one of 12 men arrested in the operation in late November by the Dothan Police Department.

He continued to serve his first term as mayor until Monday night, when the Webb Town Council officially accepted his resignation.  

In his place, the council then appointed Councilman Eddie Hamm as the new mayor of the Houston County town of 1,400 people, the Dothan Eagle reported.

Hamm and the council declined to comment after the meeting on Monday night, and would not comment after Ard was arrested on November 25.

Ard, who served on the council before he was elected to mayor, faces a misdemeanor charge of soliciting prostitution.

Authorities were tight-lipped about the nature of their investigation, but such operations generally involve undercover officers posing as prostitutes, Dothan First reported.

Authorities revealed last month that the one-day operation involved social media.

The operation, conducted by the Dothan Police Department's VICE Division, saw the arrests of 12 men, aged 22 to 69, across several counties. 

Ard was booked into the Dothan City Jail and released on a $500 bond. He has not commented publicly on his arrest.

The town of 1,400 is located in Houston County, around 120 miles southeast of Montgomery.
