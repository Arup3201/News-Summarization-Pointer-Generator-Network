A predatory Portuguese child rapist has gone on the run after he was granted bail and allowed to keep his passport while awaiting trial.

Antonio Pedro De Alves attacked a 12-year-old girl in a supermarket car park after grooming her for six months on the internet while posing as a 15-year-old boy.

De Alves, 41, skipped bail before he was due to stand trial in Stafford last week.

Predator: Antonio Pedro De Alves, who had been living in Rugeley, Staffordshire, groomed a 12-year-old schoolgirl from the West Midlands by pretending to be a 15-year-old boy on social network Bebo

He was tried and convicted of rape in his absence with the help of harrowing evidence from his young victim.

But it is feared that De Alves has escaped abroad – meaning the victim 
and her family could face a tortuous wait until he is brought to justice
and jailed.

An international arrest warrant is being  prepared to track him down.

Yesterday a close friend of the victim’s family said: ‘It beggars belief
that a foreign national accused of raping a child was ever allowed out 
on bail.

‘His victim has been astonishingly brave throughout, from reporting the 
attack to police to giving compelling evidence at the trial. Her family 
is incredibly proud of her.

‘The police, particularly the family liaison officer, have been 
wonderful and supportive. But the family just cannot understand how this
man was allowed bail by the courts and to keep his passport.

‘Apparently he had been assessed and was not deemed a flight risk. But 
the fear is that he has now fled abroad, probably back to Portugal.

‘If that is true, we can only hope that he is tracked down and 
extradited back to the UK and is handed the lengthy sentence this scum 
deserves.’

De Alves was living in Rugeley, Staffordshire, when he first contacted the victim on the social networking site Bebo.

Posing as a sports-loving 15-year-old, De Alves spent six months gaining
the youngster’s trust online before he persuaded her to meet him at a 
supermarket car park.

When the schoolgirl arrived at the rendezvous point, De Alves claimed he
was a relative of the boy who had been asked to meet her because the 
boy was running late.

The schoolgirl was immediately suspicious and tried to flee – but De Alves dragged her into his car and brutally attacked her.

Stafford Crown Court heard that after the victim went to police in 2011,
De Alves was arrested and his computers were seized. He was charged in 
January this year after a year-long investigation.

De Alves later appeared at court, but was inexplicably granted bail.
After a two-day trial in his absence, De Alves was found guilty of one count of rape and acquitted of a second rape charge.

The guilty verdict has brought some comfort to his victim, the family 
friend said. But he added: ‘Justice will only be fully served when this 
monster is caught and jailed for a very long time.’

An NSPCC spokesman said: ‘There may have been a reason to grant bail to a
child sex offender but it’s difficult to see how that was made with 
good judgement.

‘He is obviously a dangerous man who should have been kept in custody or
at the very least strictly monitored so he could not go on the run.

‘This lamentable situation means that more children are now at risk of 
abuse from someone who should now be languishing in prison.’

Vinny Bolina, spokesman for West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, 
confirmed that the judge in the case had ordered that an International 
Arrest Warrant for De Alves be prepared within 14 days.

A spokesman for Staffordshire Police, said: ‘During the investigation De
Alves... answered police bail on numerous occasions pending detailed 
examination of forensic evidence.

‘He failed to appear at crown court last week and was convicted in his absence. A warrant for his arrest will now be issued.’

The spokesman added: ‘Staffordshire Police follows strict, national 
guidelines in relation to granting suspects bail and any bail conditions
that are imposed.

‘The protection and safeguarding of young people is a top priority for Staffordshire Police.’ 
Anyone with information about De Alves’s whereabouts should contact 
Staffordshire Police on 101 or call the Crimestoppers charity, 
anonymously, on 0800 555 111.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly carried a headline stating the police granted Mr De Alves bail and allowed him to keep his passport. We are happy to clarify that this action was taken by the Crown Prosecution Service.
