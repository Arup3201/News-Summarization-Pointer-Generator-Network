A British tourist was killed in an horrific helicopter crash when the aircraft plummeted into New York's East River seconds after take-off.

Sonia Marra was trapped inside the chopper after it spun out of control, landing upside down in the murky water.

The victim's partner Helen Tamaki, her mother Harriet Nicholson and stepfather Paul are fighting for their lives after being pulled to safety by rescuers.

Pilot Paul Dudley also survived the accident. He is a close friend of the family.

Shock: The woman is held tight by her rescuers as others wait to pull her to safety

Chaotic: Dozens of rescue workers had rushed to the scene to try to pull the victim from the cold water

Miss Tamaki had organised the doomed flight to New York to celebrate her partner's 40th and Mr Nicholson's 71st birthdays.

The chopper took off from the East 34th Street heliport shortly after 3pm and lifted about 25 feet into the air before encountering trouble.

Witnesses first thought the pilot was attempting some sort of 'daredevil' manouevre before watching in horror as the Bell 206 Jet Ranger fell from the sky.

It came to rest upside down 50 feet below the surface of the swift-moving water with just its skids showing.

People on the nearby docks began throwing life jackets into the water and emergency crews were on the scene in seconds.

A dozen boats converged on the crash site. Police officers doing a counterterrorism drill jumped into the water wearing their uniform.  

They found two people clinging to the aircraft and one trying to swim to shore.

A man was reportedly attempting to dive under the chopper in a futile attempt to rescue Miss Marra.

'The pilot did indictate that there was somebody still in the helicopter,' Lt Larry Serras said. 'By the time we swam to the helicopter it was completely submerged.'

It took 90 minutes to recover Miss Marra's body. She was in the back seat and was not buckled in by any belt. Medics declared her dead at the scene.

Survivor: Pilot Paul Dudley, 56, had more than 20 years of experience

Mrs Nicholson and Miss Tamaki are both in critical condition at the Bellevue Hospital, according to the New York Daily News.

Mr Nicholson is being treated at New 
York University Medical Center. Mr Dudley, a 56-year-old veteran pilot, 
was treated at the scene.

His helicopter was not equipped with 
floats and was upside down in the water - which had a temperature of 
around 66F -  as rescuers arrived.

Mr Dudley's wife said she had spoken briefly to her husband after the crash.

'I think that he's OK,' she said. 'These were actually very dear friends of ours that were in the helicopter.'

Hundreds of people were only able to watch in horror as the tragedy unfolded.

Joy Garnett and her husband were on 
the dock waiting to take the East River ferry to Brooklyn when they 
heard the blades of a helicopter and saw it start to take off from the 
nearby helipad.

She said she saw it do 'a funny curlicue'. 

'I thought, "Is that some daredevil move?" But it was obviously out of control,' she said.

'The body spun around at least two or
 three times, and then it went down. It didn't make much noise. It was 
just a splash and sunk.'

'It sank fast,' Luis Reyes told the New York Post. 'There were two guys on the outside holding on, screaming: "Help! Help!"'

'The water is not too cold, but even 60 degrees can be dangerous,' coast guard spokesman Erik Swanson told the New York Post.

Tragic ending: Rescue workers take away the body of Miss Marra which was recovered from the river after a 90 minute operation

Desperate search: A dozen boats had been involved in combing the river for survivors

Crash site: The helicopter went down with five people on board after taking off from the heliport at 34th Street

Carlos Acevedo, of Puerto Rico, was with his wife at a nearby park area when they saw the helicopter go down.

Mr Acevedo said: 'It sank fast. In seconds. Like the water was sucking it in.'

The helicopter has already been 
recovered from the water and will be examined by crash investigators at 
Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn.

Miss Marra, described as a 
larger-than-life personality with a heart of gold, had moved to 
Australia some years ago where she once ran bar in Sydney's Newtown 
called Madame Fling Flong's.

She had sold the venue and started selling fruit at a market in the neighbouring suburb of Glebe.

Probe: Investigators have so far found no mechanical reason for the crash

Salvage: The Bell 206 tourist helicopter, which was not equipped with floats, was pulled from the East River hours after the crash

They gathered in quiet groups in the gay bars and nightclubs of Sydney's Newtown to pay their respects to Sonia Marra.

As news of her death spread around the suburb, where gay couples openly walk the streets hand in hand, the community reacted with tears and cries of dismay.

Miss Marra was described as a larger than life personality, known to just about everyone among the older generation of lesbians in Newtown.

She had moved to Australia from the UK many years ago and for a number of years had run a bar in Newtown called Madame Fling Flong's, which, with its gold-padded bar and soft couches, was popular with the lesbian community (pictured above).

She told her customers that every couch had been lovingly chosen and she had found the wallpaper on eBay - 'it was the last roll.'

At the Sly Fox pub in Newtown, customers said the gathering would be more of an early wake rather than the usual fun night out.

'She moved on from Madame Fling Flong's a couple of years ago and we were all sad to see her go,' said Jennifer Walsh, 32, one of the women who gathered at the Sly Fox.

'Sonia was just, well, Sonia - she was always there. If you didn't know her well you might think she was a bit gruff, but she had a soft heart, a heart of gold.

' I can't believe she's been killed like that. It's just terrible.'

Connie Calligeros, another member of the gay community, described Miss Marra as 'the light of Newtown - she had that kind of personality. She just bubbled.'

By coincidence, Aleks Dawson, a former Sydney resident now living in New York, told the Sydney Morning Herald that he saw Miss Marra and her partner in the Big Apple last Saturday and recognised her from his days as a student in Newtown.

'She was cool, tough and a little bit scary at first. But she was actually very down to earth and to the point,' he said.

'It breaks my heart. She was a tough-as-nails, hard-working woman with a heart of gold.'

RICHARD SHEARS

One of her co-workers Joe Galluzzo 
revealed how Miss Tamaki, originally from New Zealand, had planned the 
trip to New York as a special birthday celebration.

'She was overjoyed - she couldn't 
stop talking about it,' he said. 'She must have told everyone of her 
customers about it. They already loved her and it was because of her 
personality that fruit sold so well. Everyone seemed to gravitate 
towards her.'

Mr and Mrs Nicholson, who now live in Portugal, had met up with their daughter and her partner in New York.

They had been sightseeing and planned to go to Linden, New Jersey, for dinner afterwards, according to police.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Prime Minister David Cameron to tell him about the tragedy.

'We have a family who've come here to
 see the best of our city and to end up in a tragic accident like this 
just breaks our heart. Our thoughts and prayers are with them,' he said 
last night.

'From what we know so far, the pilot 
reported having trouble keeping aloft, tried to turn back, but crashed 
in the water just north of the landing pad.'

The helicopter was built in 1976 and formerly operated as a news chopper.

It was owned by father-of-three Mr Dudley, who is also the director of Linden Airport, near the Statue of Liberty.

Linden Mayor Richard Gerbounka described him as an accomplished pilot who flew light aircraft as well as helicopters.

In November 2006, Mr Dudley landed a Cessna 172 light plane in a park near Coney Island in Brooklyn after the engine failed.

No one was hurt during the emergency landing, and the plane was taken back to Linden after mechanics removed the wings.

The chopper which crashed in East 
River is one of the world's most popular helicopter models and was first
 flown in January 1966.

They are light and highly 
manoeuvrable, making them popular with television stations and air taxi 
companies. They cost up to $1.2million.

In August 2009 a small plane collided
 with a helicopter over the Hudson River, west of Manhattan, killing 
nine people, including five Italian tourists.

A government safety panel found that an air traffic controller who was on a personal phone call had contributed to the accident.

The Federal Aviation Administration changed its rules for aircraft flying over New York City's rivers after that collision.

Pilots must call out their positions 
on the radio and obey a 161mph speed limit. Before the changes, such 
radio calls were optional.

Earlier that year, an Airbus 320 
airliner landed in the Hudson after hitting birds and losing both 
engines after taking off from LaGuardia Airport.
