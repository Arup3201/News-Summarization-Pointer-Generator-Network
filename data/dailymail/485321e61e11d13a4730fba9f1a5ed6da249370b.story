It's not often that the Queen comes face to face with fellow female ruler but during a visit to an agricultural show in Scotland today, she was shown several.

Unfortunately for the apiarists, the monarch looked less than impressed with the miniscule Queen Bees, apparently preferring the cattle instead.

Once inside the parade ring, she was brought up short by an encounter an enormous white bull but appeared to enjoy the experience, beaming broadly as she presented its owner with a silver cup.

The Queen is currently on her traditional summer break at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire but will lead tributes to the fallen of World War I during a special memorial service in Crathie Kirk tonight.

Today is the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War and the moment is being marked with memorial services across the UK, France and Belgium.

The monarch has taken a low key role in the Great War centenary commemorations, letting the Prince of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge take the lead at home and abroad in contrast to June's D-Day anniversary.

Then, the Queen took centre stage, appearing at a ceremony with President Obama and President Hollande of France at Sword Beach and laying a wreath at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

Enjoying the day: The Queen was all smiles as she toured the Turriff show ground in Aberdeenshire

At ease: The Queen didn't bat an eyelid when confronted with an enormous white bull during her visit

This time, her contribution will be 
limited to a service at Crathie Kirk, a church on the Balmoral Estate, while the Duke of Edinburgh will do the same at Sandringham.

'The Prince of Wales and The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are representing The Queen today in Glasgow and Belgium respectively, at the events to mark the centenary of the First World War,' said a Buckingham Palace spokesperson when approached by MailOnline.

'The Queen is often represented on official visits by Members of the Royal Family - in fact throughout her reign, Her Majesty has been supported by members of the Royal Family to assist her in public duties.'

With the Queen in Aberdeenshire, it was Prince William who led tributes the Belgian civilians who died in the opening hours of the conflict during a service in Liège.

Speaking to an audience that included Spain's King Felipe, German president Joachim Gauck and King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of the Belgians, the Duke thanked the Belgian people for their resistance
 to the invasion 100 years ago, saying:

'Their resistance was as gallant as their suffering was great.'

Something for later? The Queen looked thrilled as she was shown a stall selling local sausages and burgers

Praise: Kate looks solemn as William gets up to make a speech in which he paid tribute to the Belgian sacrifice

Watchful: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and President Hollande look on as the ceremony begins

Later, the Duke and Duchess are expected to join Prince Harry for a memorial service at St Symphorien 
Military Cemetery near Mons.

Two 
kilometres outside the city centre, it contains the graves of 229 
British and Commonwealth soldiers and 284 Germans, the majority of whom 
were killed during the Battle of Mons - the first major British battle 
of the war.

Mons,
 which saw a British attempt to hold the Mons–Condé Canal fail after a 
sudden French retreat, lasted for more than two weeks.

Although
 the German army came close to taking Paris, British and French 
victories in the Battle of the Marne that followed saw the invaders 
pushed back before the war got bogged down in stalemate and trenches.

Tribute: Prince Harry began the day in Folkestone, where he took part in a memorial parade along The Leas

Memorial: Harry was following in the footsteps of the men who embarked on boats to France from the port

The
 men who died in them were also remembered by Prince Harry earlier this 
morning when he took part in a parade through Kent port of Folkestone.

Folkestone
 was a key embarkation point for men heading to the trenches, with many 
travelling along a route, now renamed the 'Road of Remembrance', that 
took them down the Leas and past the seafront to the ramps from which 
they boarded the boats to France.

Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales joined the Prime Minister in a special service at Glasgow Cathedral where both men laid wreaths and paid tribute to the men and women who died.

Later, the Duchess of Cornwall is expected at a service of remembrance at Westminster Abbey, while the Duke of York will be at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast.
