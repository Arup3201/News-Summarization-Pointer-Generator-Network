If global temperatures continue to rise, the taste of your favourite wine could either drastically change, or the drink could be off the menu completely.

A wine expert has warned that fine wines in particular, such as Pinot Noir, are having their flavour significantly altered due to climate change. 

And, as a result, vineyard owners are ditching these grape varieties in favour of those that are better equipped to handle the increases in global temperature.

A wine consultant from Lund University in Sweden said climate change is ruining the flavour of certain wines (shown). Drinks such as Pinot Noir are unable to cope with rising temperatures. This is because their grapes ripen faster, and vineyard owners have a more difficult task to work out when they are at optimum flavour

The effects are said to be most prominent in France, Italy and Spain - although parts of America, including California, would also be affected.

The primary reason is that the grapes are growing faster than before due to increased temperatures - an effect more prominent for wines such as Pinot Noir.

According to a study by Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania, climate change causes sugar levels to mature too quickly, while flavours ‘lag behind’.

Waiting to harvest grapes until the flavour is fully developed results in less acidity.

This creates a ‘flabby’ wine with a high alcohol content, as the ratio of sugar to acidity is too high.

As the atmosphere warms, the desired ratio of acid to sugar occurs earlier in the season.

The optimal flavour moment may occur earlier too - but not as much - leaving a gap between the ideal sugar-to-acid ratio and the ideal flavour.

Experts also said that grapes lack colour when they ripen faster. 

This is making it hard for vineyard owners to know when to pick the grapes at the right time to maintain a wine’s particular taste.

In her study, wine industry consultant Kimberly Nicholas, associate professor of sustainability science at Lund University in Sweden, wrote: ‘Climate change is beginning to affect the singular flavours that people expect from different wines - the experience you come to know and trust from your favourite reds and whites.’

She continued: ‘As the atmosphere warms, the desired ratio of acid to sugar occurs earlier in the season.’

‘The optimal flavour moment may occur earlier too - but not as much - leaving a gap between the ideal sugar-to-acid ratio and the ideal flavour.’

She also said that grapes lack colour when they ripen faster.

According to the Telegraph, the wine industry has already begun adapting to the problem, with vineyards dropping Pinot Noir in favour of grapes that can tolerate higher temperatures.

Now some vineyards are switching to more temperature-resistant grapes as others like those that make Pinot Noir (shown) struggle. This could see such become less widespread, or removed from menus completely

Earlier this year, researchers also warned that climate change could increase the chances of wine becoming corked.

The bark of the trees might be being chemically changed by increased exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of climate change. 

The genetic study was led by Dr Rita Teixeira of the University of Lisbon and shows how the £1.2 billion ($2 billion) cork industry is at risk.

While cork struggles to maintain its consistency, plastic and metal wine stoppers are on the rise.

To produce a good product, cork producers need bark at least one inch (25 millimetres) thick. If the cork is too thin, it will let air into the bottle and ruin the wine.

But the trees, called Quercus suber trees, have undergone a drastic decrease in quality to the point where there bark is now as little as 0.1 inches (three millimetres) thick - just 10 per cent the optimum level.

The reason for this dramatic drop in just two decades was unknown but now Dr Teixeira and colleagues think the blame can be pointed at climate change - although she said there could be other culprits.
