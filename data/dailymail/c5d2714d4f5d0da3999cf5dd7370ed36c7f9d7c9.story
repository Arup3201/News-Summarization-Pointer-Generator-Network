Costumes from The Great Gatsby went on display in London today.

Twenty pieces worn by cast members of the film - including Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan - will be showcased in the Regent Street store of menswear brand Brooks Brothers.

The brand, which made the menswear costumes worn in the film, collaborated with the film's costume designer Catherine Martin to host the exhibition.

Catherine - who is married to the film's
director Baz Luhrmann - said: 'Brooks Brothers is mentioned numerous 
times in Fitzgerald's writings as a representation of the ultimate 
gentleman's purveyor of fine clothing to the American man of 
distinction.

'It is this most basic and fundamental connection that has made our collaboration so authentic.'

In addition to their work on set, Brooks Brothers have also worked with Catherine on a limited-edition Gatsby collection to mark their involvement in the movie.

The costumes were designed by Catherine Martin, wife of director Baz Luhrmann and feature in his forthcoming film

The art-deco inspired range, which includes everything from three-piece check suits to straw boaters and wingtip shoes, channels the same 'dreamlike world of pristine green lawns and lavish parties'
depicted in F. Scott Fitzgerald's original 1925 novel.

Catherine pointed out that Brooks Brothers is mentioned numerous 
times in Fitzgerald's tome, and he himself was a customer, making the project completely authentic.

She added that the brand was considered to be 'the ultimate 
gentleman’s purveyor of fine clothing to the American man of 
distinction' during the Roaring Twenties.

Catherine said: 'It was a pleasure to research and design menswear of this period and see it realised with such panache by Brooks Brothers.

'It is a reflection of the immediacy and modernity of Fitzgerald's work in this new collection.'
