Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...

With several beaches in Newcastle already closed due to rough weather, a shark sighting has prompted lifeguards north of Sydney to give swimmers a double reminder about taking the plunge.

A 1.8 metre shark has been spotted off Bar Beach on Friday morning, while images have emerged of what appears to be shark bites from nearby Merewether Beach on Thursday night.

Several Newcastle beaches had already been closed on Friday by lifeguards due to rough seas, but signs have since been erected warning of shark sightings.

A City of Newcastle Council spokesperson said the person bitten by a shark on Thursday appears to have minor injuries to the leg.

'We're getting all of this third hand because it was not reported to our lifeguards, they were off duty at the time, but someone was reportedly bitten by a bull shark, or the person thought it was a two foot (61cm) bull shark,' she said on Friday.

'I have also seen a picture on social media of the person's leg with a few little holes in it. So not to downplay it because any kind of shark bite is serious, but it's very minor.'

This comes as a bodysurfer posted an Instagram photo of his alleged shark bite on his leg on Thursday. 

'Got me! Tagged by #Bruce well, maybe his little brother. #sharkbite,' Pedroflores captioned the photo.

It was soon followed by surf photographer Rod Owen's close up image of the injury.

'Remember when your mum said don't swim after dark! @pedroflores getting very lucky with a nibble from a pesky bull #shark at #merewether beach, #Newcastle this evening. Glad your (sic) ok son!' he wrote on Instagram.

A fellow bodysurfer, who goes by the username 'thefoof', responded with a photo of her own wound.

'Now we've both been bitten by sharks @pedroflores #sharkbite #jesush #poopyopants,' she wrote.

Beaches around Newcastle were shut for a record nine days in January after repeated sightings of a five-metre great white shark, nicknamed Bruce.

Lifeguards will continue to warn swimmers about the recent sightings and patrol on jet skis to keep an eye out for further activity.

'(But) usually what happens is the shark will take off the same day,' the council spokesperson said.
