James Phillips, 22, will become the youngest ever manager in the FA Cup's 143-year history on Saturday when he takes charge of Romsey Town against Fareham Town.

The youngster got hooked on the computer game Football Manager as a teenager, and now finds himself in charge of the Wessex League Division One side.

Phillips began his coaching career at just 16 and after getting his FA Level One and Level Two badges was made manager of the Hampshire club, who have just been relegated and are in a period of rebuilding.

Prodigy: At 22 years old, James Phillips is the youngest ever manager in the history of the  FA Cup

Focused: Phillips commands the respect of the Romsey Town dressing room despite his tender years

Ahead of the Extra Preliminary Round clash, Phillips said: 'We've done a massive rebuilding job and recruited around 30 new players who all can't wait to get out and play in the FA Cup.

'The club made the first round last year - we have four or five games to reach that this year but I would like to think we can match that.'

Phillips will next month start his Uefa B Licence, but for now his focus is on Romsey Town, whose squad includes players more than 10 years older than him - club captain and centre back Ben Andrews is 33.

The custom vehicle fitter and former goalkeeper said: 'I had the ability [as a player] but I didn't think I could progress in the game so I took up coaching.

'I've always been interested in management and the tactics of the game - ever since I got my first Football Manager computer game.

'As soon as I got home from school I would play it for ages - I even got my local side Eastleigh FC to the Premier League.'

He added: 'I've heard I'm the youngest in the competition's history so that's something to be proud of.' 

FA Spokesman David Barber said: 'I've been our historian for 30 or more years and I've never heard of a cup manager aged 22.

'James would be the youngest by my reckoning.' 

An attendance of around 150 is expected for Saturday's match.
