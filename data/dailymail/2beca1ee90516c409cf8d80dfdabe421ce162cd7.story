A South Carolina family have now spent nine months quarantined in their home and had little to no contact with humans for the past 280 days in a bid to protect their daughter with a rare condition.

Glenn O'Neill and his wife Cara have opted to stay away from other people to help their daughter Eliza, five, who has the rare metabolism disorder, Sanfilippo syndrome.

But they are determined to make sure she does not miss out - recently Eliza's school held a Frozen-themed dance, but as the five-year-old could not attend, her family recreated the dance at their home - much to Eliza's delight.

Glenn O'Neill and his wife Cara and their son Beckham have now spent nine months quarantined in their home  to protect their daughter Eliza with a rare condition (all pictured).  Recently Eliza's school held a Frozen-themed dance, but as the five-year-old could not attend, her family recreated the dance at their home - much to Eliza's delight

Glenn O'Neill and Eliza dance in their living room to the Frozen song. Children with the disease typically develop deficiencies in muscle growth, speech and brain functions by the time they are five, and later become confined to a wheelchair as it spreads. Victims typically die before they are out of their teens

Eliza danced with her father and swayed happily as her parents took to the 'dance floor' in the touching video.

But the family are still anxiously waiting for the outcome of a clinical trial they have been raising funds for - so far $2.2million has been donated to the foundation.

Children with the disease typically develop deficiencies in muscle growth, speech and brain functions by the time they are five, and later become confined to a wheelchair as it spreads. Victims typically die before they are out of their teens. 

Mr O'Neill told MailOnline: 'She is holding on as best she can. We are now nine months into our self-imposed isolation. For 280 days our family has had little to no contact with any people directly, or anything people have touched.' 

Quarantine: Five-year-old Eliza O'Neill (pictured), who suffers from Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A), has not left her home in Colombia, South Carolina, since May after her family started a voluntary quarantine 

Family: Eliza (pictured with her father, Glenn, mother, Cara, and brother Beckham) was born with the terminal disorder

Father and daughter: The youngster (pictured with her father) lacks an enzyme vital for normal cellular function, causing a lethal buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate -  which leads to leaning and behavioral problems

In May Eliza and her brother, Beckham, eight, were pulled out of school and Mrs O'Neill left her job as a pediatrician for special needs children. 

Mr O'Neill now works from home as a purchasing consultant.

'Science often does not move at the speed a parent or child would hope, particularly one with a degenerative disease urgently waiting a chance at life,' he said.

'Multiple teams are working on it, but to a parent of a child now 5 years & 3 months with Sanfilippo, time is not on our side.

'We thought we'd be closer to a clinical trial start date by this point. As things stand, even if we get news of success in the drug making soon, we are still likely at least 6 months away. We won't ever give up though.  

The family do leave their home but only to 'open fields, empty beaches, a state forest.'

At home and in hospital: When Eliza's family launched a fundraising campaign to find a cure for the disease nearly a year ago, they said they expected her to lose her ability to speak by her fifth birthday

Sick: And although the five-year-old can still talk, her father, Glenn O'Neill said words do not come as easily to her and she appears to have stopped learning new things. Above, Eliza is seen in hospital with her mother

The children Skype with teachers and grandparents.

The family's food shopping is done by grandmom and everything that enters the house is wiped down with disinfectant wipes.

Everything else they need is ordered on Amazon and other online shopping.

While they hope the quarantine will keep her healthier for longer and increase her odds to be a candidate for a life-saving clinical trial, Eliza's family realize the only way to really save her is a cure. 

Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A) is a genetic and terminal disorder that affects around one in 70,000 live births.

Victims lack an enzyme that is essential for normal cellular function.

The condition eventually causes a buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate - leading to learning disabilities and behavioral problems.

Sufferers typically die before they are out of their teens. There is no known cure.  

They had expected her to lose her ability to speak by her fifth birthday, which was in November.

Although she can still talk, Mr O'Neill said words do not come as easily to her and she appears to have stopped learning new things.

But he added: 'She still is speaking, reciting her letters and counting.'

They launched a fundraising campaign for the disease nearly a year ago.   

They have already gained more than $1.8 million on a GoFundMe page, in a bid to fund an upcoming clinical trial for a gene therapy they hope will cure Eliza. 

Although there is no guarantee that the treatment will work - or that Eliza will get into the clinical trial - her father said he and his family had to try. 

He said the family will remain in isolation until there is progress and admitted the decision had been 'the hardest of our lives.'

'But, if Eliza were to build up immunity to the AAV9 virus that they are using to deliver the drug product, she would not be selected for the trial...her only chance at life,' he added. 

Siblings: The O'Neill's have already gained over $2million on a GoFundMe page, in a bid to fund an upcoming clinical trial for a gene therapy they hope will cure Eliza (seen with her brother)

The family's food is ordered online and all of the groceries have to be wiped down with disinfectant wipes when they arrive at the house
