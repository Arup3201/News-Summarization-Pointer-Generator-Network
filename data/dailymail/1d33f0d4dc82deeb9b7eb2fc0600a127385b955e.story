A 10-year-old New Jersey boy died from injuries he suffered when he jumped from a window at his school, reportedly after having an argument with another student about a game of chess.

The name of the boy, a fifth-grade student at the Grant School in Dumont, has not been released.

He jumped from a second-story window at the school at noon on Friday and fell nearly 25 feet to the concrete below.

The boy, whose name hasn't been released, may have jumped from the window after an argument about chess

The boy was taken to Hackensack University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead around 5pm last night, the Record reported. 

A teacher's aide and other students were in the room when the boy jumped, WABC reported.   

He wrote a note and passed it to another student before he went over to the window.

Superintendent of Schools Emanuele Triggiano (pictured) called the incident a 'terrible thing' and added, 'The most important thing is to make sure that the child is in our prayers'

The note, which ended up in the hands of an adult in the room, may have had something to do with a dispute about a chess game the boy had with another student earlier in the day. 

A person in the class reported witnessing the fight, according to reports.

Sources have told The Jersey Record the letter was not a suicide note. 

After the boy jumped, emergency workers, teachers, and witnesses all tried to assist him.

While the boy was being attended to, he was able to move his leg and hands.

Superintendent of Schools Emanuele Triggiano  called the incident a 'terrible thing'.

He said: ''The most important thing is to make sure that the child is in our prayers.

'There were a number of students who were in the classroom and we've provided them with some assistance and we will continue to provide them with assistance through the weekend and on Monday.'

Corey Schlosser, 27, has a daughter in kindergarten at the school. 

She said: 'I was scared and just freaked out.

'I don't know how something like this could happen, especially at a school. 

'They're supposed to be protecting our children.'  

In addition to kind messages being posted, a campaign asking student to wear blue and gold to school in honor of the dead boy was also started on Twitter

The incident was being treated as a suicide during a three-hour investigation yesterday. 

Grant School will be open on Monday morning.

A campaign asking student to wear blue and gold to school in honor of the dead boy has started on Twitter.
