A Texas teacher will be giving one of her students something far more valuable than any grade could ever be - a new kidney.

First grade student Matthew Parker, 6, will be receiving a new kidney from Lindsey Painter, his teacher at Hoffmann Lane Elementary School in New Braunfels.

Parker first received a kidney transplant from a deceased donor when he was two, but needs a new one because his body is rejecting the organ.

Parker, one of three triplets who are all taught by Painter, and his family made a public plea for a donor in December and people from all over the United States tried to help. 

It wasn't easy to find a donor for Parker because of his prior transplant and doctors put the odds of finding an exact match at about one per cent, according to KXAN. 

After sorting through more than 80 applications, doctors finally found a perfect match - Painter. 

She said: 'It's hard not to feel like this is the way things were meant to be. 

'Everything has fallen into place and it's happened that way for a reason.'

Painter worked as a teacher in the Comal Independent School District for 13 years before coming to Hoffman

Painter began working at Hoffman Lane last summer, My Fox Austin reported. 

She has worked as a teacher in the Comal Independent School District for 13 years but decided to transferred to Hoffmann Lane to be closer to her family.

The surgery is going to happen next month and Parker and Painter will each miss about six weeks of school.

Donors must be between the ages of 21 and 60, and in excellent health.

Donors must understand risks and complications, and must be in a stable life situation with family or social support to help during recovery time.

Donors can be family members or relatives, friends, etc. You do not have to be a blood relative of the recipient.

To make things even easier on Painter, the school is going to make up for her lost wages. 

She said: 'Matthew's insurance will cover my portion of the surgery and my amazing campus has stepped up to cover the income that I'll lose while I'm out of work.'

The average donor kidney lasts about ten to 12 years. 

Matthew's mother, Lisa Parker, said: ''It still feels like a dream.

'For it to be an exact match too, it was a miracle.

'There's no words that can say anything because it's more than thank you, it's deeper.' 

Doctors performed 16,896 kidney transplants in 2013, but only 5,733 of those came from living donors, according to the National Kidney Foundation.

Only 639 of those donations came from people who were not related to the person who needed the kidney.
