John Collins believes Celtic must produce their best performance of the season to secure a place in the last 32 of the Europa League.

Thursday night’s opponents Salzburg have already qualified from Group D and Celtic spurned a glorious chance to follow suit when they could only draw against minnows Astra in Romania earlier this month.

They can, however, progress with a win over a side Collins regards as the best pressing team in Europe, although he has warned standards must be raised after Saturday’s narrow win over Dundee.

‘If we don’t play well we won’t get a result. It won’t be like the SPFL, where we can be average and still win,’ Collins said. ‘That’s the reality, with no disrespect meant to the other teams.

‘But against this calibre of opposition everybody will have to be at it on Thursday night. Without a doubt, it’ll have to be our best performance of the season.

‘They play with a real intensity and lots of energy and pace. They’re a really fit team who obviously do a lot of good work on the training pitch. That’s where performances come from.

‘They’ve a new coach but it’s the same principles. They’ve got the potential to be in the latter stages.

‘They don’t have “great” names as individual players but they are a team. Everyone knows their jobs and they work hard together from the first minute to the last. They hunt in packs.’

Central defender Jason Denayer remains a doubt after sustaining a kick to his ankle which saw replaced against Dundee.

That is a concern and Collins added: ‘We want our strongest defence available. Salzburg are a very good team. I watched their game from the weekend again on Monday night. They’re probably the best pressing team in Europe.

‘They don’t give you a minute on the ball, so it’s going to be completely different to what we’re used to in the Premiership, where teams sit off us. They just keep pressing you so our players will have to be on their toes and move the ball quickly.

‘If you dwell on the ball against teams like that they’ll take it off you in dangerous positions.

‘It should be a great game for us and that’s what we want — to learn and develop and keep stretching ourselves. We know we’re going to have to have a top performance to get a result. An average performance won’t get a result.’ 

Defender Jason Denayer said he believes Celtic could reach the semi-final or even final of the Europa League

Failure on Thursday would mean a nervy night in Croatia against Dinamo Zagreb in the final group game in two weeks’ time although Celtic can lose tomorrow and still advance if Astra beat Dinamo.

Collins is keen to take care of business with a game in hand however and added: ‘That would be the ideal scenario and that’s the objective on Thursday night. Can we get the job done?

‘Then we could look forward to the last game in the group with no pressure.’

Collins meantime dismissed talk linking him as a potential successor for outgoing SFA Performance Director Mark Wotte and insisted he is happy with his current job.

‘It’s nice of Mark Wotte to say that — but I’m the Celtic assistant manager,’ he said. ‘I’m very happy here and it wouldn’t interest me at this stage.’

Collins is an advocate of the SFA’s performance schools strategy implemented by Wotte.

The Dutchman’s abrasive style did not win wholesale approval, but the former Scotland international says the nationality of the new man is less important than his ability to deliver results.

‘I don’t think nationality matters at all. It’s about whoever is best for the job,’ said Collins. ‘It’s about quality, not nationality.

‘It’s an important role, a very important role. You need to have someone overseeing it and pushing things on. It keeps everyone on their toes if they know they are being assessed.

‘When someone knows they aren’t being assessed then people can get complacent. There’s no-one springs to mind for me, but I’m sure they’ll be scouring the country and Europe. It has to be a football person, 100 per cent without a doubt.’
