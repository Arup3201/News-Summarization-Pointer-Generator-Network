Eddie Howe has admitted he is 'looking forward' to travelling to Villa Park in the fourth round of the FA Cup - and well he might given Bournemouth's incredible record in Birmingham so far this season.

The Cherries' solitary visit to England's second city so far this campaign saw them hammer Birmingham City 8-0 at St Andrew's in the Championship back in October.

Incredibly, that result means that high-flying Bournemouth have actually scored more goals in Birmingham during the 2014-15 season than Aston Villa have throughout their whole Premier League campaign at Villa Park.

Aston Villa have scored just seven Premier League goals at Villa Park so far this season

Bournemouth netted eight goals in a huge Championship victory over Birmingham City in October

Eddie Howe will take his Bournemouth side to Villa Park in the FA Cup fourth round later this month

On October 25, Bournemouth headed to St Andrew's to face Birmingham City and dished out a hammering to Bristol City.

Marc Pugh scored a hat-trick, Tokelo Rantie bagged a brace, while Brett Pitman, Callum Wilson and Matt Richie also got themselves on the scoresheet.

In 10 Premier League games at home so far this season, Villa have managed to score just seven times.

They have failed to find the target in half of those matches, and have netted more than once on only two occasions.

In fact, Marc Pugh - who netted a hat-trick against Birmingham - has scored more goals (three) than any Villan has at Villa Park this season.

Even Tokelo Rantie, who bagged a brace in the 8-0 win, has scored the same number as Gabriel Agbonlahor (two) and Andreas Weimann (two) have at Villa Park in the Premier League this campaign.

Villa fans have seen just eight goals in all competitions at Villa Park so far this season

Christian Benteke has netted just once at home in the league for Aston Villa so far this campaign 

Villa's only other scorers in the Premier League at home have been Ciaran Clark, Alan Hutton and Christian Benteke. 

And, even if you take into consideration all competitions, Villa have still only managed the same number of goals at home this season as Bournemouth netted in that game against Birmingham.

A 1-0 loss to Leyton Orient in the Capital One Cup second round failed to add to the tally - but Paul Lambert's men did score the only goal in a 1-0 victory against Blackpool in the FA Cup third round at the weekend.

And Benteke's strike on Saturday finally allowed Villa to equal Bournemouth's tally of goals in Birmingham so far this campaign.
