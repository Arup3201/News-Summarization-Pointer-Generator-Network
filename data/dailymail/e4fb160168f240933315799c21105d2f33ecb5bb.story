Comedian Rory McGrath has been arrested on suspicion of carrying out an attack following a 'drunken row' in his hometown.

McGrath, 57, was held after police were called to a house in Pool, near Redruth, in Cornwall, last Friday.

It is alleged the 'Three Men in a Boat' star attacked a man and a woman who tried to help him while he was 'heavily in drink'.

A man in his 40s suffered a bloody nose and scratches during the alleged incident, according to Devon and Cornwall Police.

Rory, who was born and grew up in Redruth, was held at Camborne police station and questioned and later bailed until July 5 pending further inquiries.

The exact circumstances surrounding the alleged attack, which is said to have taken place inside a property at 10.15pm last Friday, remain unclear.

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'Police were called to a property in the Pool area, near Redruth, at 10pm on Friday May 10, following a report that a man had assaulted a male and female couple, who it was understood, were attempting to assist this man who was heavily in drink.

'A man in his late 40s received a bloody nose and scratches to the face. A 57-year-old man from the Cambridge area was arrested on suspicion of common assault and ABH assault. He was later bailed until July 5.'

McGrath was educated at Redruth Grammar School and went on to Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

He became a member of the Cambridge Footlights before finding fame on the Channel 4 sketch show Who Dares Wins.

Rory is also known for roles in Chelmsford 123 and as a regular panellist on They Think It's All Over.

A spokesman for the comedian said she did not know anything about the alleged incident.
