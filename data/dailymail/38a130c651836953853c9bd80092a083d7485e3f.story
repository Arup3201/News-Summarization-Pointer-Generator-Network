They look like two typical fans posing in front of Kayne West as he performs at the wedding of the favourite grandson of Kazakh dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev.

 But the pair with their eyes on Kim Kardashian's boyfriend are two eligible Kazakh 'princesses', from enormously powerful clans in the oil and gas rich ex-Soviet state made famous by Sacha Baron Cohen mocking film starring TV reporter 'Borat'.

On the left is Venera Nazarbayeva, 23,  the tyrant's granddaughter, whose Sandhurst-educated brother Aysultan, a Kazakh military intelligence officer, was celebrating his wedding with West's $3 million gig.

On the right is Shynar Nematova, 22, a graduate of University College, London, and daughter of ambitious deputy premier of Kazakhstan, Kairat Kelimbetov, a close Nazarbayev crony.

 Other pictures posted on the web by guests at the lavish celebration in Almaty were captioned as showing glamorous Shynar and West on the dance floor together.

Aysultan, 23, is being groomed as a possible successor of the 73 year old president, say some sources in Kazakh capital Astana, though fierce battles between influential clans mean it is hard to predict what will happen when he goes.

 Nazarbayev - widely criticised for human rights abuses and rigging elections - employs Tony Blair as an advisor  in an £8 million a year consultancy deal.

 Ironically, one of Nazarbayev's most implacable foes is Rakhat Aliyev, ex-husband of his daughter Dariga, and father of both Aysultan and Venera.

Aliyev, once head of Nazarbayev's secret services, now lives in exile in Europe where he fears he could be seized by Kazakh spies and forced to face 'political' charges in his homeland.

 'Kayne West should have thought twice before performing in Kazakhstan for the Nazarbayev family,' said an opposition source.

Criticism: West has found himself embroiled in controversy after the rapper raked in a reported $3 million to perform at the wedding

'Kim should have warned him about the truth behind these glamorous people he was singing and dancing for.'

West has found himself embroiled in controversy again after the rapper raked in a reported $3 million to perform at the wedding, according to TMZ.

President Nazarbayev, who is 
reportedly worth billions, is a controversial figure and has been at the
 centre of claims of violating human rights and corruption.

Singer Sting previously refused a similar invitation because of his record on human rights.

The bash took place at the Hotel Royal 
Tulip in Almaty, the capital of Kazakhstan, the country memorably 
lampooned by Sacha Baron Cohen in his 2006 movie Borat.

Expensive tastes: Kanye and his girlfriend Kim Kardashian (pictured at the Met Ball in May) like to splash out on the finer things in life

Kanye performed a selection of his hits 
including Can't Tell Me Nothing and part of his set was captured on 
video by a wedding guest, who posted it on Instagram.

In
 2011, Sting pulled out of an arranged concert for the president over 
claims of human rights violations on oil workers in the Central Asian 
country.

He said at the time, ‘Hunger strikes,
 imprisoned workers and tens of thousands on strike represents a virtual
 picket line which I have no intention of crossing.

‘The
 Kazakh gas and oil workers and their families need our support and the 
spotlight of the international media on their situation in the hope of 
bringing about positive change.’

David Mepham, director of Human Rights 
Watch has said: 'Kazakhstan's serious and deteriorating human rights 
situation includes "credible allegations of torture, the imprisonment of
 government critics, tight controls over the media and freedom of 
expression and association, limits in religious freedom, and continuing 
violation of workers' rights".'

Kazakh
 website Tengrinews wrote that the party celebrated the nuptials of 
Aysultan Nazarbayev and Alima Boranbayeva. Aysultan, 23, is the youngest
 son of President Nazarbayev's eldest daughter.

He is a graduate of Sandhurst, and now works for the country's ministry of defence.

Meanwhile his bride Boranbayeva, 20, reportedly attends London's Courtauld Institute of Art.

Kanye is worth millions, but he and girlfriend Kim are well known for their expensive taste.

The couple who recently welcomed their first child North West, have splashed out a whopping $750,000 on four gold-plated toilets for their new home.

They are also said to have spent an incredible £750,000 on special-edition luxury beds for the $11 million Bel Air mansion.
