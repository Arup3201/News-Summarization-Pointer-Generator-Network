French Prime Minister Manuel Valls was yesterday blasted for turning into a 'fuddy-duddy' version of Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair.

Cecile Duflot, who until recently was a member of the Socialist government, is furious at its apparent U-turn in favour of business.

Attacking the increasingly right-wing M Valls, she said: 'Imitating Thatcher in 2014, it's very sad. The value of a company is also created by its workers.'

In an interview with Les Echos newspaper, the former housing minister added: 'The stand-up liberal Manuel Valls reveals in his stance a strategy of communication aimed at appearing modern.

'To be modern, does not mean being a Blairite-Thatcherism fuddy-duddy. Being modern, is to say that the ecological transition is our economic horizon and that it's approved by companies.'

M Valls infuriated left-wingers earlier this week by telling members of France' s main employers' union, Medef: 'I love business'.

This was despite his party coming to power in 2012 after President Francois Hollande said he 'disliked' big business and viewed the world of finance as his 'enemy'.

There has since been a change of tack by both President Hollande and M Valls as, faced with record unemployment and a stagnated economy, they try to improve the situation.

They have already replaced left-wing rebel Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg with Emmanuel Macron, a former Rothschild merchant banker.

Tony Blair - hated by many in his own party

Former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is widely admired by many French business people for the way she revolutionised Britain during the 1980s, but despised by the Left.

Ex Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair is also viewed as a radical who rejected Socialist dogma in favour of pro-business policies. Allegedly trying to sound like both of them, M Valls told the Medef members earlier this week: 'France needs you.

'I know it is the custom to pit the Left against the business world, it's an old tune. But I deeply believe that our country needs to shake off this position, these role-plays that we are so used to.

'It has made us lose too much time, and our country is dying because of these positions.'

The French government is now placing all its faith in a so-called 'Responsibility Pact' which will see firms benefit from â‚¬40 million worth of tax breaks in the hope that they will recruit 500,000 new staff over the next three years.

But many fear that the left wing rebellion will grow in intensity, inevitably leading to the end of the Socialists time in power.
