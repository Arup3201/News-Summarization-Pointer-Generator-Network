Billionaire designer Ralph Lauren has donated to specialist cancer treatment centre, The Royal Marsden Hospital.

The NHS Trust hospital, in London’s Chelsea, say it is delighted to have Lauren’s involvement and investment, as 74-year old is in London  this week to launch the special breast cancer centre.

Lauren is a long-time advocate of research into cancer: he founded the Ralph Lauren Centre for Cancer Care and Prevention in 2001 in Harlem, New York and is credited at the designer to bring breast cancer awareness to the mainstream fashion world.Scroll down for video...

Generous: Ralph Lauren is an advocate of charities and research into cancer

In a rare video interview, the American designer talks about his involvement with cancer charities and his own personal connections to the illness.

‘Everything I've done has been for my own emotion,’ he says. ‘I’ve never done it for a brand or a label, it's because I feel it.

‘I hate when people call me a philanthropist.

‘I see it more as coming from the heart and something I can do to improve the environment, improve something. I'm tuned into that.'

Lauren describes how his own diagnosis
 of a brain tumour in 1987 affected him. Shortly after the removal of 
the tumour, he was moved to take action when his close friend Nina Hyde 
shared her breast cancer diagnosis with him.

‘I came out very well, I was lucky,’ he says of the experience.

‘I remember meeting a friend of mine, Nina Hyde, and she told me that she had breast cancer,’ he continues.

‘I went to the fashion industry and said, “We have to do something about this. We have to give it some exposure and support.”

‘I got very caught up in it and then she died.’

Hyde was The Washington Post’s fashion
 editor for 18 years and Lauren co-founded the Nina Hyde Center for 
Breast Cancer Research at Georgetown University in 1989 after she died.

Great friends: Ralph Lauren, right earlier this year, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1987. During treatment he met The Washington Post's Fashion Editor Nina Hyde, left. They became great friends, until she died of breast cancer. Lauren opened a treatment center in her honour in 1989

‘I
 said, “What else can I do?” I’d worked on breast cancer, I certainly 
didn't solve it, but thought maybe there was more I could do,’ he says.’

The
 Royal Marsden is one of the leading cancer centres in the world. The 
partnership with Lauren came about when one of the hospital’s trustees, 
editor of British Vogue Alexandra Schulman, introduced them to Lauren.

‘We conduct around 500 clinical trials
 every year and have a major commitment to breast cancer,’ says Cally 
Palmer CBE, Chief Executive of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.

‘Our
 mission is to cure more people who are diagnosed with cancer and to 
improve the quality of life for patients who are living with cancer.

‘The kind of investment in the Ralph Lauren Breast Cancer Research Centre means that we can make a real difference.’

The Ralph Lauren and Royal Marsden Partnership launches this month.
