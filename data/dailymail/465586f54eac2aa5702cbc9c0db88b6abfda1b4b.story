Are Liverpool right to stand by Luis Suarez?

Luis Suarez is facing a ban that is set to run into next season after the Liverpool striker was charged by the FA for his outrageous bite on Branislav Ivanovic.

The Liverpool striker was charged with violent conduct at the end  a dramatic day during which  Hillsborough campaigner Margaret Aspinall admitted she was torn  over the gesture by Suarez of  donating his fine to the families of the 96 victims.

Suarez, who was fined an  undisclosed amount by Liverpool yesterday, will discover his fate tomorrow when a three-man  Independent Regulatory Committee sits to hear his case. Nobody from Liverpool or the FA will be present.

Stunned: Branislav Ivanovic couldn't believe Luis Saurez had attempted to bite him on the arm

The FA felt a mandatory three-match ban 
would not be sufficient punishment for this offence and it is likely he 
will receive a suspension similar to the seven games he served during 
his time at Ajax, when he bit PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal.

Suarez has accepted his financial punishment from Liverpool and asked 
for the money — thought to be more than £200,000 — to be donated to the 
Hillsborough  Families Support Group for the ‘inconvenience I have 
created to the  Liverpool fans and Ivanovic’.

While acknowledging Suarez was attempting to do the right thing, 
Aspinall — the chairwoman of the HFSG, whose fight for justice has been 
characterised by respect and dignity — admitted the incident during 
Sunday’s 2-2 draw was ‘awful’.      

‘I would rather not be accepting the fine from Luis Suarez because I 
would rather he had not bitten that player,’ said Aspinall, who stressed
she did not consider turning down the donation. ‘It is a nice gesture 
but it is a terrible thing under the circumstances.

‘We can’t say we are grateful because we would rather him not have done 
that at all. It is an awful thing at any time — not just this particular
week. It is nice to know he knows he has let himself, the club, the 
fans and the (Hillsborough) families down.

‘We could refuse to accept it but it is going to have to go to someone, 
and he wants to show respect and remorse to the families.’

Suarez has been genuinely  contrite following the latest  disgraceful 
episode of his career and the PFA, who said it would be ‘embarrassing’ 
if he were named Player of the Year next Sunday, have offered to help 
with improving his behaviour.

He will receive the same help at Anfield. Liverpool employ top 
psychologist Dr Steve Peters, who is credited with playing an 
instrumental role in transforming the fortunes of British cycling.

Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre insisted Suarez would not be sold. 
The Uruguay international has been warned, though, that there will be no
way back should he step out of line again.

In an interview on the club’s  television station, Ayre said: ‘It 
affects his future in the sense that we have to work with him on his 
discipline. But Luis is a very important player to the club. He’s a very
popular player with his team-mates.

‘As we keep saying, he signed a new four-year contract last summer and 
we’d all love to see him here throughout that contract.  He’s a 
fantastic player, top scorer and everything we’d want in a striker, so 
there’s no change there.

‘This is more about getting him back on the right track and it’s largely
down to Brendan  (Rodgers) now to work with him on that side of his 
character. The most important thing is that we acted swiftly.

‘Luis issued his apology and then we spoke with him last night and then 
again this morning. We’ve taken action to fine Luis for his actions.’ 

Liverpool, however, have received criticism for not issuing their own 
suspension and for leaving it to the FA to deal with the incident.

Yet some Liverpool fans will believe that for Suarez to face such a big 
ban is unjust, given what happened to Tottenham’s Jermain Defoe in 2006 
when he bit Javier Mascherano. Since that incident, though, the FA have 
completely changed their rule book and had that incident occurred now, 
Defoe — who was booked during that game against West Ham — would have 
been charged again, given the exceptional circumstances.

There has been no hiding place for Suarez in the last 24 hours and his 
personal sponsors, adidas, issued a strongly worded statement to condemn
an incident that has left the game stunned.

Asked what action David Cameron thought should be taken against Suarez, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'It is rightly a matter for the football authorities to consider.

'As part of their consideration, I think it would be very understandable if they took into account the fact that high-profile players are often role models.'

It read: ‘adidas takes this type of incident very seriously and does not
condone Luis Suarez’s behaviour. We will be reminding him of the 
standards we expect from our players.

‘Luis has admitted his actions were unacceptable and we  support the way Liverpool are planning to handle the situation.’

Liverpool’s sponsors, Standard Chartered, also issued a statement, 
saying: ‘LFC have clearly stated that this is unacceptable behaviour and
Luis Suarez has apologised for the incident. We feel the club has dealt
with  this issue appropriately and swiftly.’

Such has been the rumpus that even Downing Street became involved, with 
the Prime Minister’s official spokesman saying: ‘It is rightly a matter 
for the football authorities to consider.

‘As part of their consideration,  I think it would be very 
understandable if they took into account the fact that high-profile 
players are often role models.’

Players’ union boss Gordon  Taylor added:  ‘I think we have to work on 
the positive side of things. We’ve got a lad here who is an extremely 
good player, one of the world’s best, and he is letting  himself, the 
club and the game down by his actions.

The PFA chief executive added: ‘While it’s good he made a personal 
apology, we have got to work really hard with him and I  hope the club 
agree on this anger management business to avoid it happening again and 
setting the worst possible example.’

Repeat? The PSV star was as perplexed as Ivanovic by Suarez's behaviour

Liverpool forward Luis Suarez is back in the spotlight after appearing to bite Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic on the arm during the 2-2 draw with Chelsea at Anfield, going on to score a late equaliser.

Here are some of the previous controversies surrounding the Uruguayan forward.

February 2007: Suarez made his international debut for Uruguay against Colombia but was sent off in the final minutes after being shown a second yellow card for dissent.

November 2007: Joined Ajax from Uruguayan side Nacional but he was later suspended by the Dutch giants after a half-time dressing-room altercation with team-mate Albert Luque.

July 2010: During the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals, Suarez prevented Ghana's Dominic Adiyiah from scoring in the final minute with a deliberate handball on the line and was subsequently sent off. A penalty was awarded but missed by Asamoah Gyan and footage showed Suarez celebrating on the sidelines. Uruguay eventually went through to the last four on penalties.

November 2010: Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and fined by his club for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal during an Eredivisie match.

October 2011: Following his move to Liverpool in January 2011, he was involved in a tackle with Everton's Jack Rodwell and goes down with apparent minimal contact. Rodwell was then sent off.

October 2011: Suarez was alleged to have racially abused Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a Premier League match. Suarez was later found guilty by an independent regulatory commission and banned for eight matches and fined £40,000.

December 2011: Was seen making an offensive gesture towards Fulham fans. At this time he had already been charged by the Football Association over the racism incident, although not yet punished, but was handed a further one-match ban for the gesture.

February 2012: United and Liverpool met again at Old Trafford, but more controversy blew up as Suarez refused to shake Evra's hand before kick-off.

October 2012: Celebrated a goal against Everton by diving in front of Toffees boss David Moyes who had earlier claimed that 'divers' such as Suarez were putting fans off the English game.

January 2013: Handles the ball prior to scoring Liverpool's winner in the FA Cup third round tie at Mansfield.

April 2013: Appears to bite Branislav Ivanovic on the arm but escapes punishment on the pitch as the referee fails to see it, and scores Liverpool's equaliser seven minutes into stoppage time as they draw 2-2 with Chelsea at Anfield.
