One adoreable little girl got a surprise when she went to her uncle's house for the first time and she realized he was her father's identical twin.

'There's two of us' her father said jokingly as he carried his bewildered daughter into the family home.

The video was taken sometime in December but became a smash hit yesterday.

The viral video has already surpassed 1 million views on Liveleak.com since it was posted just yesterday. It also has over 1,000 comments on reddit.

The video shows the little girl's father introducing her to her uncle, his twin, and eventually handing her off to him.

She hilariously exchanges fast glances back and forth between her uncle and father before she is finally given back to her dad--or is he her dad?

'Oh my baby's so confused!' viewers can hear in the background.

Finally the girl befriends her uncle and feels comfortable around him. She gives him a smile, a high five, and a fist bump.

The little girl gives her father a wide-eyed stare as she tries to figure out why he looks so much like the man to her left

She becomes even more confused as she glances over at her strangely familiar looking uncle

She begins to wonder if her father can be in two places at one time
