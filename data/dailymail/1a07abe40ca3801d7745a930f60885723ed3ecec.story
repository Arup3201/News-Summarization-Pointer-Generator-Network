MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff 

Shamed manager Malky Mackay has walked into a new job with the threat of the sack already hanging over him if an ongoing FA investigation leads to charges over his sexist, racist and homophobic exchange of texts.

Mackay, who was unveiled as manager of Championship strugglers Wigan Athletic, was dismissed by Cardiff City 11 months ago.

A Sportsmail investigation subsequently uncovered evidence of racist and homophobic texts exchanged with his former director of football, Iain Moody.

Wigan chairman Dave Whelan revealed Mackay’s rolling contract includes a clause that protects the club in case the FA end up punishing their new manager.

The FA investigation is still two or three weeks away from completion and while disciplinary officials have to decide whether to differentiate between public and private communication, the most senior officials at Wembley want to see action taken. At the same time, a Cardiff investigation into eight transfers completed during Mackay’s tenure is also ongoing.

At the unveiling Whelan said: ‘We have spoken to the FA. I don’t think there is anything in the pipeline with the investigation but it’s in the contract (with Mackay), we are protecting the club.

‘I did ask Malky questions about the problems he’s had on the racist thing. He admits what he did and apologised for what he said. I accept that totally.

‘I think Malky has been so unlucky. He has done a little bit wrong and has apologised for it. It’s not like we are all saints.’

In one of the texts, Mackay, 42, described his former Cardiff owner Vincent Tan as ‘a chink’ and others referred to women, Jews and ethnic minorities in extremely derogatory terms.

The Scottish boss was sacked as Cardiff manager last season and had yet to return to football

As Mackay was being unveiled in the North West, anti-racism organisation Kick It Out criticised Wigan’s appointment, saying: ‘Wigan have disregarded the ongoing investigation being undertaken by the FA, and any potential punishment Mackay may face, by taking the decision to appoint him.

‘We need to see leadership and a respect for the processes in place shown by football club owners to demonstrate how seriously they take tackling issues of exclusion, prejudice and discrimination.’ Coincidentally, Kick It Out staged an equality and diversity session for Wigan’s apprentices yesterday.

Local MP Lisa Nandy had previously written to Whelan asking him not to consider Mackay as a replacement for Uwe Rosler, who was sacked a week ago.

Whelan said he believes Mackay is 'the man to lead us back to the Premier League'

Mackay acted in a contrite manner, saying he would continue to attend an educational programme to further improve his behaviour and attitude.

And he insisted his door was open to any Wigan player who was uncomfortable with his appointment.

‘I have spoken to a lot of people in education, diversity and equality programmes. It will be ongoing with me for the rest of my life in terms of becoming a more rounded person and better manager,’ he said. ‘My style as a manager is hands-on in terms of developing relationships and enabling my players to knock on my door and talk to me.’

Mackay will meet the Wigan players for the first time on Thursday and his first match in charge will be at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday.

May 2010: Vincent Tan is the new owner of Cardiff City.

February 2012: Mackay leads Cardiff to their first League Cup final, which they lose to Liverpool on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time.

May 2012: Cardiff lose in the play-off semi-final again, but Mackay retains his post.

Tan controversially decides that the club’s shirts should be changed from blue to red and the traditional bluebird emblem swapped for a dragon — causing huge unrest among the Cardiff supporters.

September 2012: Tan replaces the club’s chief executive, Alan Whiteley (left), with associate Simon Lim.

April 2013: Cardiff secure promotion to the Premier League, finishing top of the Championship.

August 2013: After around £35million is spent in preparation for life in the top flight, Tan publicly tells Mackay to ensure there is a positive return on his investment.

October 2013: Mackay’s head of recruitment, Iain Moody, with whom he had worked at Watford, is replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov, reportedly on work experience, although he is unable to take the job on visa grounds.

December 16: Cardiff beat West Brom in the Premier League and Mackay suggests to the Press that he will need three players in the January transfer window. Lim releases a statement on behalf of Tan that criticises Mackay for his comments and asserts that he will not be given ‘a single penny’ for transfers.

December 19: Mackay is emailed by Tan, informing him to either resign from his position or be sacked.

December 22: Cardiff release a club statement that Mackay will remain as manager ‘for the foreseeable future’.

December 26: Cardiff lose 3-0 at home to Southampton, as fans stage a protest against Tan.

December 27: Mackay is eventually dismissed as Cardiff manager.
