Embattled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was greeted with audible jeers and a few loud cheers during Saturday’s Super Bowl hand-off ceremony, which came on the heels of explosive revelations about the so-called Bridgegate scandal.

The incident cast a pall over Christie at what could have been a moment of triumph for the man considered a leading candidate for the Republican Party’s nomination to run for president in 2016.

The Super Bowl will be played Sunday in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

The governor's introduction was met with a chorus of boos interspersed with chants of support from the thousands of people gathered in the area for a Super Bowl street fair in New York City.

Bad timing: The event at Times Square came just a day after shocking revelations about the bridge closure scandal

Mr Christie did not mention the politically motived bridge closure during brief remarks in which he thanked the NFL and his New York counterpart and Super Bowl co-host, Governor Andrew Cuomo.

A portion of a huge crowd that gathered in the middle of Broadway erupted in jeers when Christie took the stage during the event marking the ceremonial hand-off of the Super Bowl to next year's host state, Arizona.

The governor spoke for just over 30 seconds on a large state set up for a group of dignitaries, including Arizona Governor Jen Brewer, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and other officials.

‘I was proud to be in New Orleans last year to accept the hand off on behalf of the region and we look forward to hosting everybody in this group that's got a ticket tomorrow to watch the greatest sports spectacle in the world,’ Christie said. ‘Congratulations to the NFL and congratulations to the host committee.’

The negative public sentiment was unusual for Christie, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association who coasted to re-election as governor in November with 60 per cent of the vote.

In the weeks since starting his second term, Christie has been dogged by scandal since it emerged last month that some of his aides and appointees orchestrated traffic jams around the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

State and federal investigations have been launched into the lane closures in September, which came after the town's Democratic mayor declined to endorse the governor's re-election bid.

Christie has adamantly denied any knowledge of the lane closures and cut ties with two of his top advisers for their apparent role in the scheme.

David Wildstein, Christie’s boyhood friend and one of his appointees at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which managed the bridge, resigned from his post after it emerged he oversaw the closures.

On Friday, an attorney for Wildstein said ‘evidence exists’ Christie knew of the closures when they were happening.

The letter did not indicate Christie involved himself in the closures in any way, did not specify exactly when he became aware of the jams and offered no evidence to back up the claim.

'Evidence exists... tying
 Mr Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period
 when the lanes were closed, contrary to what the governor stated 
publicly in a two-hour press conference,' stated the letter to the Port Authority of New York and New 
Jersey.

The missive also claimed that the governor 
lied to the public during his marathon January 9 press conference. 
During that nationally-televised appearance, Christie said he accepted 
responsibility for the scandal but denied ordering the closures or 
knowing that they had been orchestrated by his appointees and members of
 his staff.

The document also included allegations that the bridge was closed to gain leverage for development deals.

'There
 have been reports that certain Commissioners of the Port Authority have
 been connected... to land deals involving the Port Authority, that Port
 Authority funds were allocated to projects connected to persons who 
supported the administration of Governor Chris Christie,' the letter 
reads.

Additionally: 'That Port Authority funds were held back from those who refused to support the Governor.'

The
 three-page letter was written by Mr Wildstein's attorney as an attempt 
to get the Port Authority to pay for his legal bills as several 
agencies, including the FBI, investigate the scandal.

'I knew 
nothing about this,' Christie told the nation. 'And until it started to 
be reported in the papers about the closure, but even then I was told 
this was a traffic study.'

Keeping it short: Christie spoke for only 33 seconds, thanking the NFL and briefly recounting how he accepted the hand-off from Louisiana last year

As Christie attended Super Bowl events Saturday, his office fired back against Wildstein with a vigorous defense of the governor.

The email to the governor's friends and supporters accused Wildstein of seeking immunity amid an ongoing probe by state lawmakers and a U.S. attorney into the shutdown.

‘Bottom line - David Wildstein will do and say anything to save David Wildstein,’ the email stated.

The email entitled ‘5 Things You Should Know About the Bombshell That's Not A Bombshell,’ was posted on the political news website Politico.com and confirmed by Colin Reed, a spokesman for the governor.

The email also took aim at Wildstein's credibility after he claimed that he could ‘prove the inaccuracy’ of some of Christie's denials.

The letter describes the order to close the lanes as coming from ‘the Christie administration,’ but does not say that Christie himself orchestrated the closures in any way.

Christie's team denied that Christie knew about the traffic jam or its political motive until after it was over and bashed Wildstein on a variety of fronts, characterizing him as a litigious teenager, a controversial mayor of Livingston, where Christie and Wildstein attended high school together, and for his past career as an anonymous political blogger.

Much of the letter quoted newspaper articles that took critical looks at Wildstein, who resigned in December from a $150,000-per-year job that he got with Christie's blessing.

Blame game: David Wildstein, who personally oversaw the George Washington Bridge lane closures, says he has evidence that Chris Christie lied

Telling the truth? Christie staked his reputation on a January 9 press conference in which he repeatedly denied knowing about the closures or having any involvement

The Christie email notes that a 2012 article in The Record of Bergen County says Wildstein ‘was a very contentious person.’

Christie said he was blindsided by his advisers' involvement and promised to cooperate with various state and federal investigations.

Local newspapers on Saturday said the governor's political career could be doomed if it was proven he knew in advance of the four days of lane closures that caused massive delays for commuters, ambulances and school buses.

The New York Daily News said in an editorial that Christie now ‘stands on the brink of ruin’ if he cannot defend himself against the latest claims.

‘In that event, Christie's governorship is over and he should prepare to face a federal criminal probe as a private citizen. Resignation would be a must. Otherwise, impeachment would be a snap,’ it said.

Charles Stile, a columnist for the Bergen Record, a major New Jersey newspaper, wrote today that if Wildstein produces evidence that ‘turns out to be the damning, incontrovertible kind, then Christie's career will be in tatters, if not over.’

King of All Media: Governor Chris Christie attended a birthday party for shock-jock Howard Stern on Friday

Shortly after Wildstein's attorney's 
letter emerged, the Christie administration said it contained nothing to
 contradict Christie's position that the governor had ‘no prior 
knowledge’ of the closures.

A
 bipartisan committee of state lawmakers is investigating the episode, 
as is the office of Paul Fishman, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey.

Wildstein
 is among 20 people and organizations close to Christie who must comply 
with a new round of subpoenas by Monday.  His lawyer said he would 
testify if granted immunity from prosecution.

Amid the firestorm that erupted Friday, Christie attended a birthday party for shock-jock Howard Stern, hobnobbing with celebrities like Jon Bon Jovi and Jimmy Fallon.

Christie arrived at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan about 6:30 p.m. - after his motorcade zipped past reporters.

Just before 7pm, the governor took the stage at the party to wish 'The King of All Media' a happy birthday - and to introduce New Jersey native Bon Jovi, joking that he is not the 'representative from New Jersey.'

'The representative of New Jersey you want to see right now ... is one of New Jersey's favorite sons, one of my good friends, and a great artist' Christie said. 'Ladies and gentlemen, Jon Bon Jovi.'

Joker: Comedian Joan Rivers joked with the governor, asking 'how was the traffic' on his way to the party

All but two lanes of the Fort Lee approach to the George Washington Bridge were closed for four days in September - paralyzing the borough and frustrating tens of thousands of commuters

Bon Jovi performed his 1987 hit 'Wanted Dead or Alive, and Christie left the event shortly after 7pm.

Comedian Joan Rivers also was at Stern's shindig and had some fun on her Twitter page at the expense of the embattled governor.

'A surprise guest at Howard Stern's birthday was Governor Christie. I asked him how the traffic was coming in,' Rivers joked.

Christie, who has a reputation for engendering loyalty and insisting on discipline among his subordinates, explained at a December news conference that he learned of his aides' involvement when an original batch of subpoenaed emails was published.
