When it comes to perceiving a 19th century battle, it's definitely not what you would call a 'conventional' look.

Artists Eva O'Leary and Harry Griffin, both based in New York City, were on an 18-hour road trip from Florida to Pennsylvania when they were talking about how, every year, the Battle of Gettysburg is remembered with a large reenactment.

Discussing the strangeness of modern people embracing something so old and iconic, they decided to embarked on a photographic project together focusing on the people that took part in the reenactment, inspired by both 'the theatricality of the battle and the (current) popularity of sensationalized violence'.

Despite having a population of only 7,000 people, some 300,000 spectators and 15,000 reenactors descend upon Gettysburg each year for the massive event.

'When you’re there, the battlefield almost feels like a replacement for a huge sports stadium, fully equipped with grand stands and concessions,' O'Leary and Griffin said in a joint statement about the project, which first featured on Two States.

'The town revolves around 1863, and survives on the economic bubble of war tourism.'

The project, which they called Devil's Den, fuses new and past worlds together in a multicolored sequence, without the gore of war and will be published as a book of photos.

'The collaboration has been rewarding, but it did present a few challenges,' they said.

'There were many long days with upwards of 14 hours of shooting and all of it during the July heat wave.

'For several years we’ve been relying on each other for feedback with regard to our individual projects, so we are familiar with how the other works and thinks.

'This project has given us a chance to work together for the first time.

'We still have lots of work ahead of us, but are looking forward to completing the book.' 

The Battle of Gettysburg was fought July 1–3 in 1863 during the American Civil War and is seen as a pivotal assault.
