Barcelona fans have voiced their displeasure with the club after it was revealed their kit for next season will carry hoops, not stripes.

In the club's 115 year history they have never had a hooped kit, and supporters of the Catalan club do not want to break with that tradition now.

In a poll in Spanish newspaper Sport, 78 per cent of fans said they did not like the kit and did not want it to be introduced next season.

Mundo Deportivo reveal Barcelona fans are not happy about the proposed change to a hooped kit

Spanish paper Sport, who broke the story on Tuesday, say 78 per cent of fans do not like the kit

Mundo Deportivo carried out a similar exercise among their readers, with an even more emphatic response. Eight out of 10 supporters rejected the idea of moving to a kit with horizontal stripes. 

Barcelona's first ever jersey in 1899 was half red, half blue. Over time this design evolved into vertical stripes, and the club have alternated between the two ever since. 

But now the club intend to have a hooped kit for the 2015-16 season, although it is believed the away kit would not bear the new design.
