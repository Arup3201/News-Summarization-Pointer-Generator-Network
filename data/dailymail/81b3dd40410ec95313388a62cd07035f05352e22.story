Re-arrested: Rolf Harris was held last week while answering bail, after three women in Australia came forward

Rolf Harris was re-arrested on suspicion of new sexual offences after three women came forward in Australia, it emerged today.

The 83-year-old was questioned last week over ‘further allegations’ made to Operation Yewtree detectives, after police in his home country passed on the information to Scotland Yard.

Harris, from Bray in Berkshire, was arrested for a second time last week after answering police bail and learning he faced additional claims.

The Australian Federal Police today confirmed to MailOnline that they are helping with the investigation.

The entertainer, who was first arrested in March,  is said to be in 'complete shock' about the new allegations and has vowed to 'fight them'.

In May at least two Scotland Yard detectives flew to Australia to interview a Sydney woman, named locally as Lauren Martell, 43, as part of their investigations into the allegations against Harris.

The woman did not say she was a victim, but had told the police she was a witness.

In the following days it is understood that two more women came forward and gave statements to the Met who were helped by Australian detectives.

Scotland Yard declined to comment today and the Australian Federal Police said their officers were helping the Met with their inquiries.

'This is a massive blow to Rolf,' a source close to him told the Daily Mirror.

'He fully denied the original allegation but the fact that more people have come forward has come as a complete shock.

'He completely denies all of the claims against him and will fight them.'

Harris is being dealt with under the 'others' strand, meaning the allegations have no link to shamed DJ Savile

Police insisted that the allegations remain unconnected to paedophile Jimmy Savile, who sparked the Yewtree inquiry.

The Australian-born star is the biggest name to be arrested as part of the inquiry into historic sex offences.

He was first questioned under caution when he attended a police station by appointment in November last year.

His original accuser is a woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by him when she was a teenager.

Harris’s wife of 55 years is the Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen Hughes, 81.

The
artist and singer received a rapturous reception from fans when he 
performed on London’s South Bank and in Bristol this year.

Earlier,
a leaked email from his Sydney-based brother and manager Bruce Harris 
revealed the family’s frustration at the pace of police investigations.

Writing
to a friend, Bruce said: ‘This has been dragging on for nearly seven 
months. The Plod in the UK are certainly taking their time.

Rare public appearance: Harris performed at the Wickham Festival in Hampshire over the first weekend in August, where he greeted fans with a loud 'G'day!' and became emotional as he thanked them for their support

'We’ve been 
advised by Rolf’s top-notch legal team to sit tight and make no 
comment.’

Others held 
as part of Yewtree include pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie 
Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis, publicist Max Clifford and comedian Jim 
Davidson.

A Metropolitan 
Police spokesman confirmed Harris was 'further arrested on suspicion of 
sexual offences in connection with further allegations made to Operation
Yewtree'.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
