Britain has spent more than £100 million in the past year on consultants to combat cyber espionage and the growing use of the internet by terrorists.

Now, MPs are investigating the soaring costs of employing private contractors, some paid the equivalent of £150,000 a year, three times the average wage at GCHQ, the Government’s signal and intelligence agency.

The specialists are mostly IT experts recruited to ensure the security agencies have state-of-the-art systems to run complex surveillance operations, thwart cyber attacks and provide digital back-up.

Soaring costs: MPs on the Intelligence and Security Committee are have appointed an independent investigator to review bills being paid by MI5, MI6 (pictured) and GCHQ

But MPs on the Intelligence and Security Committee are so concerned about the size of the consultancy fees, they have appointed an independent investigator to review bills being paid by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.

Last year, MI5 spent £56.8 million on consultants, 73 per cent up on the previous year. This year, the bill is predicted to rise by 52 per cent to more than £80 million.

And GCHQ last year spent £43 million on 297 part-time contractors at its Cheltenham headquarters. Under last year’s spending review, all three agencies are facing an 11 per cent cut.

But the cutbacks have left gaps which are being plugged by outside contractors.

The huge fees paid are understood to have angered serving staff, some of whom are on salaries of less than £25,000.

Earlier this year, GCHQ directors complained they couldn’t keep staff because  of poaching by Google and Microsoft which could afford to offer generous pay deals.

Whitehall sources argue that private consultant costs are high because of ‘public sector pay constraints’.

A GCHQ spokesman said: ‘GCHQ takes controlling the cost of consultants very seriously.’
