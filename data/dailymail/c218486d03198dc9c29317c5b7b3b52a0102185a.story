As the iconic British car of the 1960s, motorists all over the world want to own a classic Mini Cooper.

Nearly 15 years after Austin stopped producing the vehicles, fans will pay in excess of $20,000 to make one their own.

But one driver in Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, who purchased the car had their dreams demolished - when US customs crushed the car and turned it into scrap.

Crush: An Austin Mini Cooper is picked up by a crane at Price's Auto Recyclers in Plumsted, New Jersey

Elevated: The car, believed to have been produced in 2000, is then lifted off the floor by the machine 

Squeeze: The claw on the machine moves inwards, crushing more of the roof of the car 

It was torn apart as part of an initiative between the US and British governments - called Operation Atlantic - aimed at preventing imports of such cars across the Atlantic.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials are trying to prevent those Minis, as well as Land Rover Defenders, that don't meet U.S. safety and emissions standards from entering the country.

If they make it, the vehicles are seized from owners who thought they had followed proper procedures.

In the case of the Mini destroyed on Thursday at Price's Auto Recyclers in Plumsted, New Jersey, Leon Hayward, assistant director of trade & cargo security at the U. S. Customs and Border Protection's New York Field Office, said the Mini left England destined for the Newark seaport.

According to NJ.com the Mini was likely manufactured in 2000 but the Vehicle Identification Number, or VIN, had been changed to disguise the car as a 1988 model in an effort to skirt federal safety and emission standards. 

Vehicles that are at least 25 years old are exempt from those standards.

Nancy Lewis, associate administrator at the U.S. Department of Transportation told Yahoo: 'Foreign sellers were defrauding American consumers who thought they were purchasing a vintage car, when in fact they were purchasing a potentially unsafe car.'

Destroyed: As the machine makes its way through the car chassis, the Mini begins to tip towards the ground 

Collectors' item: The cars, which Austin stopped producing in 2000, cam fetch more than $20,000 

Safety checks: A Customs and Border Protection Officer inspects the Mini Cooper that arrived to Port Elizabeth  that had numerous violations associated with it related to importation
