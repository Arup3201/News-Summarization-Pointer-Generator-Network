As these pregnancy announcements show there are seemingly endless possibilities for fun-loving parents-to-be to share their broadcast their joy to the world.

From riddles to arts and crafts, these internet-savvy couples are opting for unconventional ways to tell unwitting friends and family that they're pregnant.

While overjoyed, many parents dread the sleepless nights and morning sickness ahead - but these couples take it with a pinch of salt and poke fun of the madness ahead with their hilarious images. 

Other couples use wordplay on Vanilla Ice lyrics, or add a 'We're' sign above the label of a jar of Prego sauce, while others get you thinking with maths games or props. 

Some even choose to publicise that they've got a little bun in the oven by playfully incorporating their existing children or the family dogs. 

Judging by the booming trend - as exemplified by the lesbian couple with custom T-shirts, whose pregnancy message was shared thousands of times online - simple, conventional announcements are out.
