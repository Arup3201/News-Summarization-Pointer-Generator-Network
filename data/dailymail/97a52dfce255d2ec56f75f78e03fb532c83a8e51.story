Payout: Rob Cooper received £370,000 for losing is role as a deputy chief executive at Yorkshire and the Humber Strategic Health Authority but went into another NHS job

Campaigners are calling for huge NHS 
payoffs to be scrapped, after three bosses were paid a total of 
£1million – only to walk into new Health Service jobs.

The
 ‘revolving-door’ culture came under fire after manager Rob Cooper 
revealed he had been working full-time since last March despite a huge 
redundancy payment.

Mr Cooper received at least £370,000 but already had a new job lined up at a different health trust.

Millions
 of pounds have been spent on dozens of managers whose roles have 
disappeared under the Government’s Health Service re-organisation.

The 
NHS spent £1.4billion on redundancy packages for staff in the last three
 years with some receiving deals of more than £600,000.

Some 2,299 
bureaucrats have been handed six-figure golden goodbyes since 2010. Many
 simply moved to another part of the NHS.

Under
 Health Service rules staff must wait only four weeks after taking 
redundancy before they can move to a new job.

However Sir David 
Nicholson, chief executive of NHS England, appealed to managers to wait 
at least six months.

Mr Cooper received between £370,000 and £375,000 
for losing his role as a deputy chief executive at Yorkshire and the 
Humber Strategic Health Authority.

But by the time the trust was shut down he had a job as director of finance for South London Healthcare NHS Trust.

NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson has urged staff made redundant not to take another job for six weeks, but has blamed reorganisations for large pay deals

He
 now works as interim finance director at Barking, Havering and 
Redbridge University NHS Trust. He said: ‘I have only charged for 75 per
 cent of my time, which I believe reflects the spirit of the letter from
 Sir David.’

The Department
 of Health has pledged to cap redundancy payouts and claw back money 
from those who work again for the NHS within a year, but this will not 
be retrospective.

Jonathan 
Isaby of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘NHS staff shouldn’t be in line 
for obscenely large pay-offs in the first place, but it’s appalling that
 pay-outs have gone to staff who have walked into other NHS jobs weeks 
later.

‘It’s time the revolving door into highly-paid public sector jobs was shut, permanently.’

Family affair: Karen Straughair and husband Chris Reed received six-figure pay-offs from NHS trusts but both got jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust

Another
 NHS manager, Steve Spoerry was paid between £335,000 and £340,000, 
after his job as managing director of Halton and St Helens Primary Care 
Trust was axed last March.

He is now director of strategy at South and 
West Yorkshire and Bassetlaw NHS Commissioning Support Unit, which 
insists it has  ‘followed NHS England’s guidance’.

Former
 chief executive of Doncaster Primary Care Trust Annette Laban was 
handed between £285,000 and £290,000 before taking up a £15,500-a-year 
part-time role as a non-executive director of Sheffield Teaching 
Hospitals.

There is no suggestion that any of the appointments were outside the NHS rules.
