Vice President Joe Biden is saluting military veterans, calling them not only the 'heart and soul,' but the 'spine of the nation.'

Biden spoke at Arlington National Cemetery, where he participated in a wreath-laying ceremony in honor of Veterans Day.

Biden singled out the generation of men and women who joined the armed forces after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, stating that the 3.5 million men and women of that 9/11 military generation made their decision with the near certainty they would be deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan.

He then noted that more than 2.6 million ended up serving in those wars. 

Biden said that the United States has never before 'asked so much over such a sustained period of an all-volunteer force.'

He also acknowledged the families of those who serve in his remarks, saying, 'It’s not just the forces on the front line that are asked to sacrifice and to serve. It’s also the families.'

Biden spoke of this while acknowledging his own son's deployment to Iraq and how difficult that was for him and his family.

There was one big problem with the speech though, as Biden at one point said, 'As of this morning, U.S. troops died in Iraq and Afghanistan: 6,703; troops wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan: 5,168.'

There have actually been 52,168 wounded troops, a difference of 47,000.

Perhaps making this misstatement even worse is the fact that immediately before listing these numbers, Biden said, 'Every day for the last six years, I ask my staff early in the morning to contact the Department of Defense to get a detailed report of the number of troops deployed, the number wounded, and the number killed. Not a general number; the exact number every day.'

Veterans Day was also marked in other major cities, with a parade down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan that drew thousands, with former New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly serving as grand marshal.

Also making an appearance was rapper and Law & Order: SVU star Ice-T, who along with his wife Coco rode on a float with six military dogs and their handlers.

In Europe, the continent marked Armistice Day with ceremonies and moments of silence as France opened an international memorial on a former battlefield. 

This year's events had special significance because this year is the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I.

She was also introduced to a horse that had been named in her honor.
