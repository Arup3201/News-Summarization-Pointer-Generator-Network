Whistleblower Jason Phur, 39, has been awarded £46,000 after an employment tribunal ruled her was unfairly dismissed

A mechanic who was unfairly sacked when he accused garage bosses of overcharging customers for unnecessary work, has been awarded £46,000 in compensation.

Whistleblower Jason Phur, 39, told an employment tribunal a whole host of not needed work had been carried out by mechanics at the garage.

He claimed one driver was hit with a £2,500 bill after he was told to remove the complete cylinder head on a car when the fault was with the engine control unit.

The father-of-three also told the hearing he was ordered to fit a new clutch on a Vauxhall Astra when it did not need replacing.

He said he voiced his concerns about the work to company director Nick Sutton who called a staff meeting where a row broke out.

Three weeks later disciplinary proceedings were brought against Mr Phur and four days after that he was sacked with a letter accusing him of a 'negative attitude' at work.

He took privately-owned Volksline to a tribunal where Mr Sutton claimed the mechanic had thrown a chair at him and worked at a 'substandard' level.

But the three-man panel rejected that and said his explanation for starting disciplinary proceedings was 'implausible and inconsistent'.  

One disgruntled customer also told the hearing he was overcharged for work when he took his car for a service in 2011.

Bank worker John Forster said the garage told him he faced a £500 bill to repair an oil leak and replace brake pads.

He told the hearing he was 'absolutely flabbergasted' and took his vehicle to a different mechanic who said nothing was wrong with it.

The panel, sitting in Ashford, Kent, ruled in Mr Phur's favour and awarded him £46,000 in compensation from the Canterbury-based company.

They said: 'A disclosure alleging a criminal offence is in the public interest.'

Mr Phur, a father-of-three, 39, from Herne Bay, Kent, said: 'They just didn't like the fact that I spoke up against the regime.

'What they did to me has had a huge emotional and psychological impact upon me.

'They were very worried that this might get into the papers so at one point they tried to arrange an out-of-court settlement, but obviously it came to this instead.

'I haven't yet recovered from the ordeal of going through it all, but at least I have been totally vindicated in pursuing this.'

Volksline was founded in 1979 by David Sutton, 70, and is run by his son Nick and a team of nine mechanics.

After the case Nick Sutton, 51, said: 'We have never fitted parts that didn't need fitting. We are an honest firm which has been operating in Canterbury for 35 years.

'We always treat our employees well. This whole thing feels like a punch in the throat.'

Mr Phur's solicitor Mike Arnold said: 'This judgement demonstrates that workers should come forward to complain if they believe that there are wrongdoings that they believe are being committed by their employer and are in the public interest.

'Whether the workers' beliefs are true or not is not the issue. As long as the allegations are made, they must be investigated correctly.

'The worker must not suffer any detriment because they have blown the whistle and certainly must not be dismissed because of it.

'The law protects those who whistle-blow.'

Volksline has never been prosecuted for defrauding any customers and the tribunal's remit does not extend to investigating such allegations.
