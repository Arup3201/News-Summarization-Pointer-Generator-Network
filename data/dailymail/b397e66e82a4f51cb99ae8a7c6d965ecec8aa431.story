Nottingham scholars splash most on clothes

University of Nottingham scholars are the biggest student fashionistas in the UK, splashing out the most on clothes from all universities in the country, according to a new student spending index.

They're also university life's social secretaries, spending most on movies and music.

In the run up to freshers week a new spending rank has given freshers an insight into what to expect from their new university, and a fascinating insight into campus life. 

Wales' top ranked university, Cardiff, is revealed as a student body of gamers, as students there spend the most on video games.

King's College London - attended by notable writers Thomas Hardy and John Keats - has the most studious undergraduates, who purchase more academic textbooks than any other students in Britain. 

There's a clear north-south divide, as those at universities in the midlands and the north are splashing their cash on having fun by buying the most fashion, technology and toys.

In contrast, those studying in the capital make more practical purchases, forking out on home improvement products to transform their accommodation, and academic books for their studies. 

London scholars are also the most active, with Imperial College London and University College London coming within the top three for purchases of sports equipment. 

Amazon Student, the membership programme for higher education students,  compiled the very first Student Index, revealing the spending patterns of UK students.

Data was compiled from sales of items purchased by Amazon Student account holders from March 31 2014 to June 28 2014, and applies to purchases from Amazon.co.uk.

An Amazon spokesperson said: 'Starting University can be an expensive time; whether it's the initial outlay on text books or homewares for new halls, there's plenty that students need for their new life. Amazon Student is designed to help students save on their spending, whilst also offering them the very best TV shows, movies and books.'
