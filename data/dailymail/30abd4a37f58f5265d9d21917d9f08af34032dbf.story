Adrian Beecroft admitted a controversial report demanding companies are given the right to fire employees without giving a reason was 'based on conversations'

A controversial report demanding companies are given the right to fire employees without giving a reason was 'based on conversations', its author Adrian Beecroft admitted today.

The venture capitalist said he did not have time to conduct detailed research as he had only two months to complete the study for Downing Street's policy unit.

Mr Beecroft rejected a claim by Labour MPs that the report was based on opinions and created an 'open door for bullying and intimidation'.

Even if small businesses grew by 2 per cent as a result of his proposals, that would see the creation of 100,000 new jobs, he said.

Speaking to a committee of MPs 
examining the details of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, Mr 
Beecroft denied his research was based 'entirely on anecdotal evidence'.

He said the case for making it easier 
for small firms to hire and fire employees was 'self-evident', telling 
MPs the UK's employment laws were a disincentive for firms to expand.

The businessman, who has backed more 
than 200 successful start-ups, said current rules had not been based on 
statistical research, adding he had spoken to both employees and 
employers as they battled through the tribunal process.

Mr Beecroft said: 'If people are doing a job that is required but they are not doing it very well, they will be replaced. If people are doing a job that is not necessary, they will be made redundant.

'I should say that the work I was asked to do was a two-month piece of work covering all employment law so I was not able to generate new statistics.

'I will accept the accusation that my views on whether or not this would improve the efficiency of people working in businesses is based on conversations, not a statistically valid sample of people.'

Labour MP Geraint Davies (Swansea West) said Mr Beecroft's report 'did not translate into the real world'.

He said: 'It just seems to me that you've failed to look at robust, empirical evidence and relied on unreliable, out-of-date, anecdotal evidence to come to these prejudicial conclusions.

'I just want to know why you didn't look at reliable, quantitative studies and instead relied on unreliable, out-of-date opinion data which didn't translate into the real world?

'We therefore come up with a load of proposals which are an open door for intimidation and bullying.'

Speaking outside the committee, Mr Beecroft said the attention his report had drawn had made him feel 'rather uncomfortable' but he would do it again as the Government planned to introduce 17 of his proposals.

He said: 'There have been days when I probably thought I wouldn't (write a report again for Government). But there were more than 20 recommendations, most of which have been implemented and that wouldn't have happened if I hadn't written it so I am glad that I did.'

Mr Beecroft's report to Downing Street exposed deep tensions in the coalition. Business Secretary Vince Cable dismissed the idea as 'complete nonsense' but many Conservatives backed the plans.

He said the British economy will grow by 5 per cent less than expected, around £50 billion, if the Government fails make radical reforms to employment laws.
