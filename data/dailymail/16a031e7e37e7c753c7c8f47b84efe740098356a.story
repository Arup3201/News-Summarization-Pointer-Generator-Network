Most people would have to be paid large sums of money to even consider swallowing an amputated human toe.

But one customer at the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City threw down $500 for the privilege before gulping one down.

The incident took place at the famous saloon in Yukon Territory, Canada, on Saturday night and staff there said it's not the first time it has happened, but the first time it was done deliberately.

Toe joke: A customer at the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City swallowed the toe in the famous Sourtoe Cocktail on Saturday night - the first time it was purposely done

Saloon: The Downtown Hotel in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, is famous for its Sourtoe Cocktail - a 40-year tradition which has been done by more than 65,000 people

Origins: The Sourtoe started in September 1973 when a local eccentric named Captain Dick Stevenson, not pictured, found a severed toe preserved in a jar, put it in a glass of champagne and knocked it back until the toe touched his lips

Captain Dick shows how it's done: The now-83-year-old says the Sourtoe Cocktail is his greatest and proudest achievement

People come from far and wide for the area's gold rush - and for the Downtown Hotel's Sourtoe Cocktail - wherein an amputated toe, which has been 
preserved and pickled, is dropped into a glass.

The customer must 
drink the shot and have the toe touch their lips.

The idea of the Sourtoe Cocktail started in September 1973, when riverboat captain Dick Stevenson found a severed big toe preserved in a pickle jar.

Captain Dick somehow got the idea of making a game with it and came up with the original rules for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends - Take a beer glass full of champagne, drop in the toe, tip the glass back…and the toe must touch the lips.

In September 1973, eight people participated in the first attempt; nearly four decades later, the Sourtoe Cocktail Club has an estimated 100,000-plus members.

Any liquor can be used in the cocktail, but the norm now is a shot of Yukon Jack whiskey. It costs just $5 and for that you sign a log book and get a certificate confirming you as a member of the Sourtoe Cocktail Club.

One rule must be adhered to however: 'You can drink it fast, you can drink it 
slow. But the lips have gotta touch the toe.'

It has been described by members of the club as a 'leathery piece of jerky with a toe nail attached'.

It costs $5 and the drinker signs a logbook and gets a certificate from the night's 'Toe Captain' confirming their membership to the Sourtoe Cocktail Club.

The drink can be anything, as long as 
the following rule is applied: 'You can drink it fast, you can drink it 
slow. But the lips have gotta touch the toe.'

Terry Lee was the 'Toe Captain' of the 
bar on Saturday night when the patron - known only as 'Josh from New Orleans' - came in, threw $500 on the table and
 drank down the shot of whiskey - toe and all.

He said the latest toe was 'mummified' with salt, and plunked into drinks for brave patrons about 30 to 40 times per night.

Lee told CBC News the customer was an 
American who had been living in Dawson for the summer, he had just picked up
 his rent deposit and was leaving town.

The posted fine for swallowing the toe is $500. It has since been raised to $2,500.

Speaking to The Star about what happened, he said: 'This guy popped it in his mouth, takes $500 out of his pocket and slams it on the table and starts walking away.

'I said, "Where’s the toe?" and he said, "I swallowed it". I was shocked.'

Throughout the 40-year tradition, more than 100,000 people have joined the Sourtoe Cocktail club.

The Sour Toe started in September 1973 
when a local eccentric named Captain Dick Stevenson found a severed toe 
preserved in a jar.

He came up with the original rules 
for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends: take a 
beer glass full of champagne, drop in the toe, tip the glass back.

Since then a number have been swallowed, lost or 
destroyed - eight in total - but fortunately for the bar, they always manage to find 
someone to donate a new toe.

Lee said they have a backup toe but like to keep two at a time so are on the hunt looking for a new one.

He told CBC: 'We like to have two toes -
 we switch them off once a week - and now we can't do that. We need 
toes. We're putting it out there, if you have a spare toe, hey we need 
one.'

Gnarly: While it may sound unsanitary, the toes are pickled for months in medical alcohol and then packed in dry salts so pose no health risks to drinkers

New member: A female customer prepares to take the Sourtoe challenge so she can join the prestigious club

Down in one: The famous tradition is mentioned in guide books and people have come from far and wide to become members of the Sourtoe Cocktail Club

Terry Lee said they are now looking for more toes: 'We like to have two toes - we switch them off once a week - and now we can't do that. We need toes. We're putting it out there, if you have a spare toe, hey we need one'

Any drink can be used in the shot, as long as the following rule is applied: 'You can drink it fast, you can drink it slow. But the lips have gotta touch the toe'

The toe is believed to belong to Steve White, a chain-link fence installer in 
Whitehorse, who got his pinkie toe amputated in January 2000 after 
developing hammertoe.

He kept it in a jar in his freezer and donated it in April 2002.

Manager at the Downtown Hotel Dick Van Nostrand told the Wall Street Journal last year: 'We've had people throwing up, we've had 
people gagging on their drinks.

'Real trouble is when someone gets 
overenthusiastic. You never know when some fool is going to do 
something stupid. And then we'll be without a 
toe.'
