A woman who defeated cancer as a child and then fought the Taliban as a teenager is planning to re-enlist as a soldier in the British Army.

Alex Darwin, 24, says her experiences prove that survivors of childhood illnesses should not give up on their dreams and ambitions.

Miss Darwin, who served with the Royal Logistics Corps, was finally accepted into the army after her first application was rejected on health grounds.

Alex Darwin, 24, suffered from leukaemia when she was a child and then joined the British Army at the age of 17. She left after a tour of duty in Afghanistan but is now rejoining after realising she should never have left

She said: ‘I've never been able to sit back and take it easy. I was on a ward with other children who did not get better, so my whole life has felt like a second chance which I needed to make the most of.

‘For me it's important to do well in life. I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't, and for that reason, I'm determined not to be a failure.’

Miss Darwin, of Rhyl, North Wales, underwent 30 months of intensive treatment after being diagnosed with leukaemia when she was just four years old.

She said: ‘It was a big moment when I lost my hair. Until that point I'd had long, beautiful hair, so I went from one extreme to another.

‘I was on a ward at Alder Hey Children's Hospital with a girl called Lucy. When my parents asked me what we should name my sister, who was born while I was in hospital, I asked them to name her Lucy after the girl I was in hospital with.

‘Lucy was my best friend on the ward, but sadly she passed away while I got better.’

Ms Darwin (pictured recently while on holiday in Paris) said: 'I've never been able to sit back and take it easy. I was on a ward with other children who did not get better, so my whole life has felt like a second chance which I needed to make the most of'

After being given the all-clear at age seven, Miss Darwin returned to school, only to experience bullying.

She said: ‘I was cancer-free but my immune system had taken a knock and I got pneumonia and meningitis, meaning I missed even more school.

‘As a result I felt unusual and singled-out. At primary school one boy kept slapping my bald head, and at secondary school I felt alienated, as if I was someone who was sickly and diseased.’

She was inspired to join the British Army shortly after leaving school when she was 16.

She said: ‘The army was a fresh chance to prove myself. I began intensive endurance training and was determined to be accepted.

Ms Darwin (pictured with a friend) said: 'Young people who have suffered with difficult illnesses do not have to let those illnesses define the rest of their lives - if you have an ambition, then you should go for it'

Ms Darwin (pictured in Helmand) was initially rejected by the army because of her health problems in childhood but she was accepted after her mother helped her appeal against the decision

Ms Darwin (pictured in hospital at the age of five) said: 'For me it's important to do well in life. I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't, and for that reason, I'm determined not to be a failure'

‘I received a letter back which said I would never be fit enough to meet army standards because of my previous illnesses.

‘I was absolutely gutted, but my parents started the appeal process for me. That was a very significant gesture for my mother. She didn't want me to join up because she thought I'd get hurt, but she knew it was my dream.’

Finally, in 2007 when she was 17, Miss Darwin joined 27 Regiment RLC, based at Aldershot.

She said: ‘I remember breaking down in tears - I had been waiting for so long, and my dream was coming true.

‘The day I went to basic training I was really excited. I didn't get homesick, even when I was out in Afghanistan.’

After her illness, Ms Darwin returned to school but was bullied because she had lost her hair and was often ill because her immune system was weak. She says the bullying meant she felt she needed to prove herself

Miss Darwin's tour of duty placed her as a defensive gunner on supply trucks serving the front lines in Helmand during the summer of 2008.

‘I was on operations the majority of the time - top cover, manning machine guns as we went through the desert and villages. We were attacked with gunfire and by suicide bombers and I saw a couple of vehicles hit by roadside bombs.

‘There were a lot of repatriation ceremonies to attend to - not just British but Americans, Estonians and Danish.

‘I remember seeing an ambulance come into Camp Bastion carrying a lad who had been accidentally shot in the head while his pal was clearing a 50 calibre gun.

‘We were coming to the end of an operation and were at a forward operating base in the Green Zone, when we were attacked with mortars.

‘I was lying on my truck in my sleeping bag thinking, “in two weeks I'll be at home”, when I heard a sound like a firework.

‘I had just enough time to roll onto the ground and get into an armoured section of my truck before the mortar round landed. I hated mortars - you just didn't know where the round would end up.’

Miss Darwin chose to leave the army in December 2009 and took on various roles, including a youth work volunteering position supporting her father Bill, a town councillor, which she still does. 

This winter she made the decision to re-enlist in the army and hopes to enter a full application in early 2014.

Ms Darwin said: 'I came to realise that I never really wanted to leave the army - it was a long-held dream, and I was good at it. I know I can do it - because I've managed to get past all the hurdles before'

She said: ‘I came to realise that I never really wanted to leave the army - it was a long-held dream, and I was good at it.

‘I know I can do it - because I've managed to get past all the hurdles before.

‘I know other young people who have applied for the forces and been declined for health reasons and have just given up. I want people to realise that they shouldn't give up.

‘Young people who have suffered with difficult illnesses do not have to let those illnesses define the rest of their lives - if you have an ambition, then you should go for it.’
