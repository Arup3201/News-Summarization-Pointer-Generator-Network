Mr Boice was out for a scooter ride and returned to hear both gunshots, police said.

Locals were shocked and saddened by the sudden, violent death of two neighbors.

‘I can't imagine what kind of problems there could have been,’ Dinie Hens told Fox 13 as she tried to hold back tears. ‘I see clothes hanging on the line and I just don't understand what could have happened.’

Another neighbor struggled to find words.

‘Oh my gosh. That is just -- it's even more shocking,’ Kari Kizman told Fox 13, adding that ‘there is help out there for people that need the help. Just ask and people will help.’

It isn’t yet clear what led to the shooting, nor have officials said what type of firearm was used.

Ms Harnish does not appear to have any prior criminal history, according to criminal records. It is also not known if Ms Harnish and Mr Boice were married.
