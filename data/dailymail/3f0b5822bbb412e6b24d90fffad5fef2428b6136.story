Jailed: Burglar Paramkesh Ballgobin switched on a PlayStation and played a football game for four hours after he fell into a youth centre through a ceiling

Most crooks would immediately begin looking for a way to escape if they found themselves trapped in a building they were trying to burgle.

But Paramkesh Ballgobin was in no hurry to leave after he fell 12ft through a ceiling into a youth training centre - he switched on a PlayStation and played a football game for four hours.

CCTV footage shows how the jobless criminal took time to pace about the centre and even removed some of his clothes before he lay back to relax in front of the games console.

Ballgobin became trapped after he fell through a suspended ceiling at the Road 2 Success training centre in Sutton, South London, at 2.30am on September 6.

The 20-year-old serial shoplifter, who has an Asbo banning him from Sutton town centre, made himself a cup of tea and tried to get the television to work.

But he became angry when he couldn't operate the remote control and so carried on playing football game FIFA on the PlayStation instead.

At one point, CCTV cameras caught him ripping a poster off the wall which said: 'Some people are gay, get over it'.

It was only at about 6.30am - some four hours after he fell - that Ballgobin realised he would need to concentrate on getting out before youth workers arrived.

He eventually found a ladder in the centre - formerly called Sutton and District Training Centre - and clambered back out of the hole he had fallen through.

Ballgobin was arrested six days later after youth workers and police recognised him.

He was jailed for a month at Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court last Thursday after he pleaded guilty to burglary.

Relaxing: With his mind focused on the game rather than trying to escape, Ballgobin leans back in his chair

Ballgobin had been trying to get into the youth centre, which helps youngsters with literacy and in finding jobs, through the roof.

But he tumbled on to a table below after misplacing his footing on the suspended ceiling.

A tutor at the centre, Aaron McCormack, said the burglar's fall had caused damage costing about £2,000 to repair.

Mr McCormack added: 'He’s so lucky. He could have killed himself.

'When we looked through the CCTV we saw him trying to get the TV to work. I think he was getting the hump because the TV remote wasn’t working.

Contempt: Ballgobin screws up a poster after it ripping it from a wall. It read: 'Some people are gay, get over it'

Comfortable: The burglar takes off some of his clothes as he makes himself at home in the centre

'He finds himself a KFC cup to supply his drinks all morning and then he just gets a chair out and then sits and plays the Playstation playing FIFA.

'It wouldn’t be such an issue if he’d just come in and played Playstation - we work hard in these training rooms.'

Ballgobin was jailed for three weeks on August 8 this year by Croydon magistrates for breaching his Asbo.

The court heard at the time that he had been given the Asbo on June 14 after repeatedly being caught shoplifting in the area and harassing shoppers.
