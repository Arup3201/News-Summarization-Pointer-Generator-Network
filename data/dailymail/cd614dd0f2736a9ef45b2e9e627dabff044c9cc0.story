An Al Qaeda-linked group claimed responsibility for twin suicide bombings that struck outside the Iranian Embassy in Beirut today, killing 23 people including an Iranian diplomat.

The obscure Abdullah Azzam Brigades said it carried out the mid-morning bombings in a Hezbollah stronghold - the latest strike in battles that have played out in the region for decades and now intensified with the civil war next door in Syria.

The authenticity of the claim could not be independently verified but it was posted on a militant website and on the Twitter account of Sirajuddin Zurayqat, a prominent Islamic militant leader.

The group said it will continue with such attacks until the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group withdraws its forces from Syria, where the group is fighting alongside President Bashar Assad's forces against the mostly Sunni rebels seeking to topple him.

Terror attack: The mid-morning blasts hit Beirut's upscale neighborhood of Janah, a stronghold of the Shiite militant Hezbollah group

A Lebanese security official said the 
first suicide attacker was on a motorcycle that carried two kilograms 
(4.4lbs) of explosives. He blew himself up at the large black main gate 
of the Iranian mission, damaging the three-story facility, the official 
said.

Less than two minutes
later, a second suicide attacker driving a car rigged with 50 kilograms
(110lbs) of explosives struck about 10 metres away, the official said.

Iranian Ambassador Ghazanfar Roknabadi 
identified the dead diplomat as Sheikh Ibrahim Ansari. Speaking to 
Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV, he said Ansari took his post in Lebanon a month
ago and was overseeing all regional cultural activities.

Lebanese Health Minister Ali Hassan Khalil said 23 people were killed and 146 wounded in the blasts.

An unidentified Iranian Foreign 
Ministry spokeswoman blamed Israel for the attacks while Hezbollah and 
Syrian officials indirectly blamed Saudi Arabia.

'Each
of the terrorist attacks that strike in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq reek of
petrodollars,' a Syrian government statement said, in a clear reference
to oil-rich Gulf Arab countries that have sided with the Syrian rebels.

At the scene, puddles 
of blood stained the ground, amid broken branches scattered from the 
force of the blasts. A woman in a black robe and headscarf, unable to 
stand, clutched a man, pleading with security forces for help.

'Nader,' she wailed, crying out a man's name. 'Nader is missing.'

Another man ran from the area, carrying a South Asian migrant worker limp in his arms.

'People aren't sacred anymore. We aren't safe,' said a mechanic whose store windows were shattered by the blasts.

He
declined to be identified because he did not want to be seen as 
involved in sectarian tensions that have split the Lebanese over Syria's
conflict.

'People fight outside (Lebanon), but send their messages through Lebanon. With bombs. It's their SMS service,' he added.

Lebanese security officials confirmed the
two bombings were both suicide attacks. They spoke on condition of 
anonymity in line with regulations.

'We tell those who carried out the 
attack, you will not be able to break us,' Hezbollah lawmaker Ali Mikdad
told Al-Mayadeen TV. 'We got the message and we know who sent it and we
know how to retaliate.'
