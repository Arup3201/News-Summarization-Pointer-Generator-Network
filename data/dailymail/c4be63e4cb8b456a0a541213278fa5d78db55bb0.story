The parents accused of murdering their six children in a house fire have begged prison bosses to be allowed to attend their funerals.

Mick and Mairead Philpott are currently in custody and have put in an application for compassionate leave to attend the services, according to reports.

They face six counts of murder following the fire at their home in Allenton, Derby, on May 11.

Grief: Mick and Mairead Philpott cried at a news 
conference about the fire, which killed six of their children

Mairead Philpott wore a white sleeveless dress to court showing her tattoo that bears her dead children's names

Their children Jade, 10, and brothers
John, nine, Jack, seven, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five, all died in the 
fire, and a sixth sibling Duwayne, 13, died of his injuries in 
Birmingham Children's Hospital two days later.

The People reported Mr Philpott's son
Richard, 25, told a friend: 'They want to be at the funerals and need 
to be able to say goodbye. Whatever has happened, they are innocent 
until proven guilty. The public should not judge them. Let a jury do 
that when they know all the facts.

But there are concerns for their safety and security as their high-profile case has already attracted abuse from the public.

Funeral: Mick Philpott at the hearing as the charges are read out. Funeral arrangements for the children have yet to be finalised but authorities at Derby Cathedral (right) have agreed to host a service

When the couple appeared in court on 
Friday, people in the public gallery shouted abuse during the hearing at
Nottingham Crown Court.

Another man walked out half way 
through the hearing and said 'disgrace' with his arms out and fingers 
pointing towards the couple.

Once again Mrs Philpott wore a vest 
top which exposed the heartbreaking tattoo of intertwining roses which 
bears her late children's names.

Anger: Members of the public react as a prison van, believed to be carrying the Philpotts, leaves Nottingham Crown Court after the hearing

Beaming: Mairead and Mick Philpott on their wedding day. The couple stand accused of killing their six children in an arson attack

The judge, The Honourable Mr Justice Charles Haddon-Cave, remanded the pair into custody after a short hearing.

Three weeks ago Mick Philpott, 55, 
had been hailed as a hero credited with 'valiant' attempts to save the 
children as fire swept through the three-bedroom council house.

Before their arrests, the Philpotts 
had started planning the funerals and had arranged for six separate 
double-horse-drawn hearses to carry the coffins at Derby Cathedral.

A Prison Service spokesman explained 
to The People that a full assessment would be undertaken involving 
police and other agencies.'It is a unique situation and we cannot think,
right now, of any other defendants in the past who have been charged 
with murdering their children, then wanting to attend their 
funerals.That is why it poses such a huge risk.'

The spokesperson said that public protection was key and if the risk is too high a private memorial may be arranged.

Back in May 2003, when the couple 
married in a church near Derby, with four-year-old Duwayne as a pageboy 
and baby Jade as a bridesmaid, family and friends gathered to join the 
celebration.

So far detectives have established the fire was started deliberately with petrol at the front door.

Respect: Well-wishers have left hundreds of cards, flowers, teddy bears and candles after a candlelit vigil
