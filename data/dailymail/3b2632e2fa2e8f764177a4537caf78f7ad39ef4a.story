Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer has extended an olive branch to his troublesome senator Jacqui Lambie, saying she's a team player who he wants to keep on board.

It comes after the pair engaged in a public spat over Senator Lambie's pledge to vote against all government legislation until a defence force pay deal is reconsidered.

There's speculation Senator Lambie may quit PUP, but she's taking the weekend to think over her position in the party.

Clive Palmer has toned down his language in his war of words with Jacqui Lambie, saying he cares about her as a person and hopes she'll stay with PUP

The outspoken senator has accused her party leader of trying to intimidate her and interfere with her role in the Senate.

Prompting retaliation from Mr Palmer, he lashed back at the rebel senator and accused her of lying in parliament and scheming to start her own political party.

But despite the war of words, Mr Palmer isn't giving up Senator Lambie, urging her to talk to him in person rather than through media.

Mr Palmer said previously that Senator Lambie had failed to attend party meetings and had not returned his phone calls or spoken to him for a month.

'I think she's a team player and we'd like to keep her on board,' he told ABC's Lateline on Thursday.

'If she wants to have a talk I'd have no problem doing that.'

Mr Palmer said he did not know where Senator Lambie's accusations of intimidation had come from and his party had done all it could to support her.

He excused her behaviour as a result of media pressure to break up the PUP team.

Mr Palmer on Wednesday demoted the senator from her parliamentary positions of deputy Senate leader and deputy whip and suspended her from all party meetings.

After removing PUP logos and references from her website, the Tasmanian senator split from her party colleagues in the upper house to vote against the government on a series of motions.

Senator Lambie has thrown her support behind the Australian Defence Veterans Party which is in the final stages of getting enough supporters to register with the Australian Electoral Commission.

She denies she wants to set up her own party.

During their war of words, the senator also said she will not be told how to vote by anyone and claims her only boss is the people of Tasmania.

But Mr Palmer says the outspoken senator hasn't brought a single proposal to PUP about Tasmanians or about veterans.

'She just wants to have a fight about nothing which is not a rational way to behave as a respectable senator,' he said in a statement.

She later accused Mr Palmer of spreading rumours about her and causing her personal distress.

He previously labelled Senator Lambie a 'drama queen' after she accused him of flip-flopping over her stance on Defence pay.
