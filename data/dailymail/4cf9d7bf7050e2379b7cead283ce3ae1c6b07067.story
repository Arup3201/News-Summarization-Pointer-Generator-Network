Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil has revealed he is champing at the bit to make a first-team return after nearly three months out with a knee injury.

The 26-year-old last featured for the Gunners against London rivals Chelsea on October 5, but is closing in on a comeback.

The Germany star has revealed how frustrating it has been sitting on the sidelines and can't wait to be back out playing with his team-mates sooner rather than later.

The 26-year-old has been missing for nearly three months through injury

Ozil told Arsenal Player: 'After a time, you really miss playing football.

'You miss the ball and just want to play. When you watch the games and think that you could have been playing, and playing well, it makes you miss it. But that's the way things are.

'I'm working every day to get myself fit and I'm on the right path now. It won't be much too much longer before I'm back on the pitch. I hope to be back training with the whole team again as soon as possible.'

Arsene Wenger will be hoping the Gunners can get back into the top four with victory against Liverpool

Despite an indifferent start to the season from Arsene Wenger's side, Ozil is confident they will be challenging at the top of the table come May.

He added: 'When you watch the games, we’ve dominated a lot of them but have conceded unnecessary goals.

'We have to get our points by playing the game our way… I’m convinced that we will finish the season near the top of the table.'
