Dejan Lovren's £20million arrival to Liverpool was the club's most expensive transfer for a defender in their history but has it sealed them the most tattooed defence in the Premier League ahead of next season?

Alongside Glen Johnson, Martin Skrtel and Daniel Agger, the Croatian's move to Anfield now means Brendan Rodgers could field a backline of heavily-inked up players.

Lovren, who has been Rodgers' No 1 target for central defence all summer, agreed terms on a five-year contract after he completed a medical on Merseyside on Sunday.

Deep message: Croatia international has the message 'We will never let you go' tattooed on his forearm

The former Southampton man's tattoos include positions on his ribs, upper body and arms - with one in particular reading 'We will never let you go' on his forearm.

Lovren's impressive array of body art has a long way to go before comparing to team-mate Agger's though.

The Denmark international boasts tattoo sleeves on both arms, a tribute to his parents on either calf, as well as an incredibly painful looking piece of artwork that covers the whole of his back and ribs, which includes a Viking graveyard.

No pain, no gain: Denmark centre-back Daniel Agger is Liverpool's most tattooed defender with an array of artwork all across his body

To top if off though, Agger who arrived at Anfield under Rafa Benitez in 2006, will always carry the spirit of Anfield with him wherever he goes after having the club's iconic song 'You'll Never Walk Alone' initials tattoed on his right fist.

Speaking ahead of last season, the centre-back said:

'Everyone at the club are an integral part of my life. I have a YNWA tattoo. Frankly I don't mind if we don't finish in the top four, I love the club.'
