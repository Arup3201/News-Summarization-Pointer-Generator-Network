The niece of Scientology leader David Miscavige has told of her miserable upbringing inside the church and how she tried to commit suicide by jumping off the roof of its celebrity headquarters in Los Angeles. 

Jenna Miscavige, said she was kept away from her parents sometimes for over a year at a time, forced to break rocks on a riverbed and grilled on her sex life at the tender age of 13.

Things got so bad that at the age of 16, when she was stopped from seeing a boyfriend, she climbed out onto the roof of Scientology's celebrity headquarters on Hollywood Boulevard and was ready to jump before church elders frantically pulled her back inside.

In her new book Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology And My Harrowing Escape, Ms Miscavige tells how she managed to escape the clutches of the church, famous for its celebrity devotees like Tom Cruise and John Travolta.

And she claims Cruise's six-year-old daughter Suri had a lucky escape after her mother Katie Holmes split from the superstar actor.

Ms Miscavige, 29, told the Sun: 'I don't know what will happen to Suri in her relationship with her mother but I know the Scientologists tore my family apart'.

In her incredible account of growing up inside the church, Mrs Miscavige Hill told how her parents had joined the Sea Orgs, the church's elite inner circle, and worked 14 hour days.

She was brought up in a Scientology Nursery before being sent to a ranch in the Californian desert where her days were spent breaking rocks on a riverbed.

At 13 she was given her first 'audit' in which she was quizzed about her sex life, by elders who demanded to know if she masturbated or had homosexual feelings - the sort of information which she believes they later use to blackmail members.

At the age of 16 she fell in love with a boy, but when church leader discovered they had had sex they hit the roof and tore him away from her to be 'purged' - the event that led her to attempt suicide.

Eventually the church agreed they could marry with the ceremony being held at the celebrity Scientology centre in LA, none of her family attended, there was no honeymoon and the couple were imemediately sent back to work.

Ms Miscavige's parents had left Scientology In 2000, when she was 16 years old, after becoming   disillusioned with its practices.

In the five years that followed, she has claimed that - because of the church's policy of 'disconnection' with relatives and friends who do not support the cult - all letters between them were intercepted and she was not allowed to answer the telephone for over a year.

Her book details how she and her husband Dallas, were sent to Australia by the church, in a missionary-style or work-exchange program.

It was there that she reportedly first came into contact with the internet, which, along with television, is banned by the church and began to read negative reports about her uncle.

For Ms Miscavige, a major turning point was when she decided she wanted to become a mother. While married Sea Orgs are allowed to have sex, they are not permitted to have children.

'If you do become pregnant when you're there, you get kicked out,' she told The Huffington Post.

'Or many of my friends were actually coerced into having abortions,' she alleged.

During those pivotal months, she 
re-connected with her once-distant parents who coached her through the 
difficult process of leaving the church.

Though Scientology members accosted both she and her husband when they started talking about leaving, they remained strong and stayed together.

After leaving the church, Ms Miscavige, with Kendra Wiseman and Astra Woodcraft - both also raised in Scientology - founded the website exscientologykids.com.

The site was launched as support group offering 'non-judgmental support for those who are still in Scientology, discussion and debate for those who've already left, and a plethora of easy-to-understand references for the curious'.

Following the public split between the cult's most famous member, Tom Cruise, and wife Katie Holmes, Ms Miscavige Hill spoke out in support of Holmes and the couple's daughter Suri.

'My experience in growing up in Scientology is that it is both mentally and at times physically abusive,' she said in a statement released through the Ex-Scientology Kids website.

'I was allowed to see my parents only once a week at best – sometimes not for years.

'We got a lousy education from unqualified Teachers, forced labor, long hours, forced confessions, being held in rooms not to mention the mental anguish of trying to figure out all of the conflicting information they force upon you as a young child.

'While it is very unlikely that Suri Cruise would have the same upbringing as me (due to her parent's celebrity status), any organization that is capable of mistreating and neglecting the needs of children, regardless of their social status, and which has a long history of breaking up families is no place for an innocent child.

Scientology has been dogged by controversy almost since the day it was created.

The belief was founded in 1952 by L Ron Hubbard who until then had been known for writing pulp and science fiction novels.

Followers believe that inside them are ancient alien beings known as thetans which have lived for thousands of years on other planets and were brought to Earth on a space ship that looks like a Douglas DC-8 plane.

Through a process called Dianetics they make themselves far better people, and even massively boost their IQ.

Such claims however have never been proved and instead Scientology has faced allegations it charges outrageous fees for its services and abuses its followers.

Among the most controversial aspects are 'audits' in which followers have to explain their inner secrets to a superior, including their sex lives.

There have also been reports of bizarre punishments and questions have been raised over what happened to the wife of its current leader David Miscavige, who has reportedly not been seen since 2007.

Those who join the higher order of Scientology, known as Sea Org, pledge their allegiance for one billion years - a vow supposedly made by children as young as 10.

Scientology courts Hollywood stars and famous followers include Tom Cruise and John Travolta but it is very rare that they speak about their beliefs.

Cruise's marriage to Katie Holmes was said to have ended over her refusal to allow their six-year-old daughter Suri to be indoctrinated.

She was also said to be concerned about the child being sent to the Scientology Gold Base in California where members are banned from having children, are paid just $50 a week and can be punished for simply looking at somebody the wrong way.

Scientology was also the basis of the current cinema hit The Master in which a drifter is taken in by the leader of a cult-like group.

The Church of Scientology has firmly denied the claims made in Jenna Miscavige’s book. In particular the Church refutes the suggestion that it does not provide a proper education to children in Sea Org; that it is mentally and physically abusive; and that it has coerced anyone into having an abortion. The Church of Scientology point out that their full response to Jenna Miscavige’s claims can be found at www.scientologynews.org/jennahill
