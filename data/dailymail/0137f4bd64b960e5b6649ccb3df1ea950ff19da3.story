Thousands of revellers dressed in sparkly costumes have descended on the Isle of Wight to dance around the world's largest disco ball at the last major festival of the summer.

Bestival, which has become famous for its fancy dress, has taken on the theme of Desert Island Disco for this year's event at Robin Hill Country Park.

The four-day event, which has sold out for the 10th year in a row, was kicked off last night by Beck who played a greatest hits set including fans' favourites Loser and Where It's At.

More than 50,000 have travelled to the Isle of Wight to see OutKast, Foals, Chic featuring Nile Rodgers, Disclosure, and Major Lazer.

Tonight's headliner, German DJ Sven Väth, is expected to draw a large crowd.

Festival curator Rob da Bank has also created a giant disco ball for the occasion which is expected to break the record for being the world's largest.

This will be confirmed by judges from Guinness World Records during the weekend.

Mr Da Bank said: 'Can you believe it? We've only gone and cracked it, we've built a beauty and we're certain this disco ball is a record breaker.

'So certain in fact that we've invited the nice people from Guinness World Records to come and confirm it.'

The current record for the largest disco ball is 9.98 metres and the Bestival ball is expected to be more than 10 metres.

Music fans travelled to the Isle of Wight by  hovercraft, ferry and even a speedboat service.

Those looking for a bit of comfort during the weekend have booked into the various 'glamping' options including the largest provider Tangerine Fields which has set up hundreds of tents including novelty ones designed like playing cards.

And for those wanting to escape the party for a while, there is a spa area which includes a hot tub bus with wood-fired tubs on the roof.

The event also features an inflatable church where couples can take part in mock wedding ceremonies.

The Met Office said the weekend will be largely dry and sunny but intervals of cloud will be present particularly on Saturday.
