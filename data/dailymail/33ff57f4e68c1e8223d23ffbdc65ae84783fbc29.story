They were nicknamed les poilu, meaning the hairy ones.

And given the brutal, unrelenting hardships French soldiers had to face in the First World War, that was perhaps understandable.

Now a collection of glass plates has emerged giving a fascinating glimpse into the daily lives of the French as they defended their homeland between 1914 and 1918.

It was amassed by a viscount in the Armoured Cavalry Branch 
of the French Army, who left behind several boxes containing more than 
600 plates taken by an unknown photographer.

He was employed as staff officer for French General Joseph Joffre and as part of his duties travelled along the front visiting troops.

It is not known how he came upon the images, previously 
unseen by the general public, but they appear to document life around the front during 
World War One.

The collection was found in an attic by a relative of Paris-based Reuters photographer Charles Platiau, who described them in a blog post.

Mr Platiau said: 'Fortunately
 most of the plates have indications of the location and date when they 
were taken, which have helped us identify people and sites when 
captioning the photos.

'I checked the information written on the plates with documents available from public sources to verify their accuracy.

'In
 my opinion, even if the photographs are not the best of the actual 
conflict, many of them document the vision that the generals and 
politicians wanted to present of the war â€“ they show resting soldiers 
who were well-fed, well-housed and well-treated.

'As
 I look at these plates, I think of my own ancestors who fought at 
Verdun and wonder how many soldiers in these photographs survived the 
battle. I wonder if some of these soldiers were killed days after being 
photographed.'

The photographs do not show casualties, but they do show the reality of life in the trenches: mud, shell-holes, make-shift defences and the imminent prospect of death.

They also show the soldiers' sense of humour: a bath-house offers 'free massages for ladies' and the board outside calls it a 'thermal spa', while a dug-out is called 'the chalet'.

And it shows that some aspects of French life were unaffected by the war, with the soldiers going to mass in one scene, and in another, Genral Joffre, the French commander in chief awards medals with a kiss on the cheek.

The scene is at Verdun and in the background is the road to the battleground which became known as 'the sacred way' because of the scale of sacrifice of French troops there. It has been calculated that every square centimetre of ground was hit by four shells.

The prospects for soldiers like those pictured here were not good.

The French mobilised roughly 8.5 million men during the war. More than 1.5 million were killed and three million wounded.

This 
number represents more than the total number of American, British, 
Canadian and Commonwealth forces combined.

In only the first three 
months of the war, the French suffered 350,000 dead alone. The infantry,
 being the most exposed branch, suffered a death rate of roughly 25 per cent 
with the wounded adding another 40 per cent on top of this - a 65 per cent total 
casualty rate.

Initially beset by antiquated armaments, systemic disorganisation and 
poor leadership by the top command, the French army continued to fight 
on despite hardships and death an unparalleled death rate.

Battles often dragged on for months, resulting in only minimal gains 
with losses for both sides in the hundreds of thousands.

The Marne, 
Artois, Champagne, Verdun, the Somme and the Aisne: these rank among the
 bloodiest battles in history.

Yet after 52 months of war, the French Army and its Allies emerged victorious.
