Brought it on herself: Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham, pictured, has herself to blame for becoming Britain's most hated woman, according to her mother

Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has herself to blame for becoming Britain’s most hated woman, according to her mother.

The 23-year-old former escort - who first made headlines when she had a free £4,800 NHS breast enlargement - is ‘sticking up a finger’ at the world because she is an attention-seeker, her mother Lisa Cunningham said.

But the shop worker, 50, insisted she is proud of her daughter and that her approach to life is down to the physical and psychological trauma she suffered as a teenager because of her small breasts.

Mother-of-two Ms Cunningham told the Sunday Mirror: ‘I can see when these things come out of her mouth that more and more people are going to turn against her - and that’s hard.

‘She wants the attention to be on her. She thinks that the notoriety will make her happy. I think she’s just sticking a finger up.

‘Josie is Josie and she’s not a child any more – there’s nothing I can do or say to stop her from doing these things.'

Ms Cunningham said that her daughter suffered from a genetic condition when she was younger that meant her breast did not develop properly.

She said that until the age of 11, Josie was a quiet and well-behaved little girl, but that for six years she suffered at the hands of bullies - who picked on her because she was flat chested.

She said her daughter would come home in tears every day after having been emotionally and physically abused.

She added that people would see Joise differently if they understood what she had to go through with bullying and her health.

Josie's genetic condition led to serious kidney problems and it was during one hospital visited when she was 17 that she first found out she was pregnant.

Miss Cunningham, who is now heavily pregnant with her third child, made headlines again this week when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public.

The former escort, from Leeds, has set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation.

She claims she’s fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’.

It comes after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for.

As A-level exam results were released this week, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont). 

Bullied: Lisa Cunningham said that her daughter Josie, pictured shopping earlier this month, was bullied for six years and would come home in tears after being verbally and physically abused at school

'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice.'

Her mother Lisa was also a stay-at-home mother and said that she never claimed benefits, unlike her daughter.

She said that it has become impossible to defend some of her daughter's actions, particularly her decision to smoke while pregnant.

When Miss Cunningham was caught smoking and drinking, she said it was because she was disappointed to find out that she was going to have a third boy when she wanted a girl.

Her request for a publicly-funded nose job came just a week after Miss Cunningham, whose baby son is due in October, revealed she was giving fans the chance to watch her give birth live on Skype - a move that her mother describes as 'bizarre and weird'.

'Attention seeker': Lisa Cunningham said that she thought her daughter Josie was 'sticking a finger' up at the world

At a cost 
of £200 each, 50 people will be able to log on to the video chat service
 and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink.

The
 wannabe model has already scooped a staggering £30,000 by selling four 
ringside seats to the birth of her third child at her home in Leeds.

Three
 of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is 
believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

Two were sold for £10,000 each while the other two went for £5,000 each.

Miss
 Cunningham said all tickets include travel and accommodation, while the
 more expensive ones will allow the ticket holder to film the birth and 
take photos.

She
 formed her latest Skype plan after her hopes of selling DVDs of the 
birth of her son through a chain of pound shops fell through.

Miss Cunningham has previously admitted that she doesn't know who the father of the child is and will have to wait until her son is born to have the two potential fathers take DNA tests.

Her mother said that she has her suspicions as to who the baby's father is, but refuses to name him publicly.

She added that she didn't have a problem with Josie's life as an escort because she didn't think that she was sleeping with her clients.

But she said that even though she now knows the truth, she would still support Josie if she wanted to return to the lifestyle after the birth of her first child.

As well as the £4,800 NHS breast surgery, which increased her bust from a 32A to 36DD, Miss Cunningham has also undergone Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

She claimed she needed the breast enlargement because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Earlier this year, she sparked further outrage after publicly considering aborting the son she is due to give birth to because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

Just weeks later, she claimed she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.
