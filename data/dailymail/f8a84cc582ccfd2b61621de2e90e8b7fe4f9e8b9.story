James Rodriguez was the top goalscorer at the World Cup but also showed he's capable of a great save after helping an over eager pitch invader escape the clutches of security.

The incident occurred during the Colombian’s unveiling at the Bernabeu, having joined Real Madrid for a reported fee of £60million.

After freestyling during his presentation to the fans, one boy – who was dressed in a Colombia shirt – ran on to the pitch and firmly hugged the South American nation’s poster boy.

Super saver: James Rodriguez wanted to protect a supporter who ran on to the pitch during his presentation

However, he was quickly manhandled by security off the pitch, which provoked a strong reaction from the former Monaco star.

He was taken to the side of the pitch, where Rodriguez started angrily protesting the pitch invader’s innocence, resulting in him being allowed to escape scot-free.

Rodriguez then proceeded to give the star-struck boy a football he was previously freestyling with during his presentation. The lad then buried this underneath his shirt, celebrating with a massive smile and a hand aloft, before going back into the stands.

He will hope to be allowed back into the Bernabeu to see Rodriguez play in a potentially terrifying forward line with Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema, supported by Toni Kroos.
