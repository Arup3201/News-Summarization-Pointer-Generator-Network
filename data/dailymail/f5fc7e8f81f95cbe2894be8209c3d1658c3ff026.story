John Van Wisse, a swimming coach from Melbourne, completed his 20 year dream by being the 18th person to finish the brutal triathlon and smashing the world record 

It is the 41-year-old 'iron' man, who puts our 15-kilometre run that we proudly complete without stopping to shame, as last week he became Australia's hero - running, swimming and riding 483-kilometres from London to Paris in the extreme Enduroman Arch to Arc ultra-distance Triathlon.

John Van Wisse, a swimming coach from Melbourne, completed his 20 year dream by being the 18th person to finish the brutal triathlon.

But he did more than just finish, Van Wisse ran 144 kilometres from London's Marble Arch to the Dover coast, swam the English Channel to the French coast, and hopped on a bike to complete the triathlon in a 291 kilometre cycle to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. His time was an extraordinary 61 hours, beating the previous record by more than 12 hours.

While speaking with Daily Mail Australia, Van Wisse modestly jokes that his time could have been even better if it wasn't for the wrong turn he took while running through London and brutal water conditions in the English Channel.

'I actually thought I could go 10 hours quicker and if I had a half decent channel window and I didn't take that wrong turn at the beginning I would have - so seven or so hours added on to that and that's the rub of the green,' he said. 

He said leading up to the event he would try to get as much training done without breaking down -every Tuesday he swam 15 kilometres, on the weekend he would run up to 100 kilometres and on every other day he complete four to six hours of swimming and riding. But nothing would compare to what lay ahead. 

'It was a real roller-coast.

'There was a time I contemplated pulling out; I was upset that I had got such a bad hand but then I thought I did all this training and stop feeling sorry for myself.'

Van Wisse insists that his dream would not have been possible without the sponsorship he received from Acquire Learning. 

16 hour, 144 km run from London to Dover

Eight hour rest

12 hour, 50 km swim in the English Channel

Rest for 10 hours in Calais, France

14 hour, 291 km cycle to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris

Overall time: 61 hours 27 minutes

Group Managing Director of Acquire Learning, John Wall, swam regularly with Van Wisse and knew participating in the Enduroman event was a dream of his - so Mr Wall made it happen. 

Kim Vernon, Chief Marketing Officer said Acquire Learning is about helping people and making sure their dreams come true in life. 

'We help everybody and anybody who need it - what we did in terms of sponsorship is connect to individuals and use them as an example,' Ms Vernon told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Once I met him [Van Wisse] I was so inspired. He is amazing.' 

It was only last week when Ms Vernon was on Van Wisse's incredible adventure, as she and a crew supported him '110 per cent of the way', and even joining him for a few kilometres of running.

Ms Vernon shared some of the action-packed photos taken a long the way, as Van Wisse made his journey from London to Paris.

And he's off...

100-kilometres down, 40 more to go!

The athlete said running through London was tough because he didn't know where he was going

He somehow lost the bike that was leading him, which resulted in him taking the wrong turn and adding 4-kilometres on to his run

Fortunately Van Wisse was ahead of schedule, so he was able to ease off while running towards The English Channel

Ms Vernon decided to join in and run with Van Wisse - giving him physical and emotional support along the way

THE 144-KILOMETRE RUN 

'I finished the run in 15-hours and 15-minutes - all of a sudden I felt really sick. I couldn't get breakfast down.

'I thought "this is going to be tough" especially because the English Channel conditions were really rough,' he said. 

Van Wisse chose to swim the English Channel on the Wednesday, which gave him only an eight hour break between running and swimming. He said there was only a small window of opportunity because if the weather was un-swimmable he would have had to wait a week.

'You need a bit of luck.' 

Despite his boatman warning him against swimming because of the rough water conditions, Van Wisse decided to keep going, as the clock never stops.  

Van Wisse had to give the boatman 24 hours notice before getting to the English Channel

Despite the warning of rough waters and difficult conditions, Van Wisse went full steam ahead into the English Channel for a 50-kilometre swim

The 41-year-old was mistaken for an illegal immigrant by concerned locals, as police were called to Dover’s Shakespeare Beach at around 8:30am

The humorous spectacle made international front page news. At the time, Van Wisse was too busy concentrating on the task ahead, noticing nothing. His crew was left to deal with the police

'I got to the eight hour mark and I thought "oh no" but I kept going. He said he got to 500 metres of the finish and was taken into rocks, which cause him to sprint for half an hour

THE 50-KILOMETRE SWIM

The swimming coach said that not only was the swim 'super hard' but it also took a lot out of him. 

Ms Vernon describes her sympathy for the world-record holder, as she watched him swim against the rough waters. 

'At the start of the swim his legs were jelly from the run - and then to think he had to swim through waves - there was not one stroke that I could just tune out. 

'He pushed through the barrier and did not stop,' she said. 'It was quite emotional for a lot of people around him and everyone was so determined to support him.' 

The Melbourne man admits he did not relax until he got to Paris, which is where he would end his 61-hour triathlon and claim record holder.

THE 291 KILOMETRE CYCLE 

Van Wisse told Daily Mail that cycling was his least favourite out of the three. He said he goes through phases but swimming was his background.   

After riding against the wind the whole time, Van Wisse made it. 

When asked which one was the hardest, he simple said: 'The whole thing was hard'. 

He said without the support from his amazing crew it would not have been possible. 

'I am so grateful - they were amazing,' he said. 

But Ms Vernon said she was blown away with his will to keep coming.

'He is incredble. His spirits were always up - no matter the distance.'

THE END OF A DREAM 

Van Wisse arrived home in Melbourne in the morning of Friday 29.

He was greeted by family and friends as a hero. 

'I got home from the airport and I had a really nice reception.' 

But life did not stop for the record-holder. Van Wisse said the next morning he woke up at 4am to attend media meetings. 

'It's  been full on but it is slowly getting back to normal. 

'The support was unbelievable when I arrived home - it has been fantastic,' he said. 

Ms Vernon describes Van Wisse as an incredible and extremely humble guy.

'John makes any triathlon seem so small now.'
