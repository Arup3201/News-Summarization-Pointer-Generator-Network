Americans will spend more on their Fourth of July barbecues this year than ever before after the price of items such as beef, lettuce and ice cream hit an all-time high for the month.

Independence Day is the most popular time of year for outdoor grilling but an index tracking U.S. retail prices for seven foods commonly enjoyed during the holiday shot up 5.1 percent in May from a year earlier to the highest ever for the month, the latest data from Bureau of Labor Statistics show.

The Bloomberg-compiled barbecue index follows the price of ground beef, white bread, American cheese, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, ice cream and potato chips - all items commonly enjoyed during summer socializing.

Beefing up the price: Smoke wafts up as hamburgers are prepared on a grill outside the White House in Washington, Thursday, July 3, 2014. The cost of ground beef is up 16 percent on last year

But prices for ground beef are 16.5 percent higher than a year ago, thanks to a shrinking U.S. cattle herd.

Meanwhile tomatoes, a traditional burger addition, soared 12 percent and ice cream climbed 1.7 percent, according to the figures.

American cheese was up 11.1 percent year on year for May 2014. However, potato chips fell in price, down 3.1 per cent compared to the same time in 2013.

Drought in California was blamed for increased produce costs.

Soaring prices: The barbecue index shows U.S. retail prices for seven foods commonly enjoyed during Fourth of July shot up 5.1 percent in May from a year earlier to the highest ever for the month

Ground beef        up 16.5% to $3.85 per lbWhite bread         no change $1.40 per lbAmerican cheese up 11.1% to $4.51 per lbIceberg lettuce     up 7.5% to $0.99 per lbTomatoes              up 12% to $1.63 per lbIce cream             up 1.7% to $4.91 per 1/2galPotato chips        down 3% to $4.37 per 16oz

All data shows percentage change from May 2013 to May 2014 as a US city average

But experts don't believe the high cost will deter revelers, who are likely to party on into the weekend given the holiday falls on a Friday this year.

'(Consumers) are becoming adjusted to these price levels, Rabobank Food and Agriculture Research and Advisory vice president for animal protein Don Close told Bloomberg.

'I would expect the overall grilling demand to be very good. The natural long weekend will be a benefit.'

However, price-conscious families may attempt to offset costs.

'Do we expect there to be some trade-offs and some adjustments made on the behalf of some consumers? No doubt that's going to happen,' Close told the website, adding that he expects the bulk to splash out to enjoy the day.

'Overall, I think they're ready to take the plunge and say, "Let's go enjoy the holiday."'
