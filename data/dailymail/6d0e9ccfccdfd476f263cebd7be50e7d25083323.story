After a hard day of hunting for molluscs, a weary walrus needs a place to relax.

These mammals seen clustered onto a chunk of ice floating in the Chukchi Sea 20 miles off the coast of Alaska seem to have hit on the perfect spot.

The photographer who captured the scene said he was 'amazed' to spy the walruses relaxing on the iceberg surrounded by open water.

Herd: Photographer Steven Kazlowski was hovering over the coast in a single-engine plane when he spotted the walruses clustered on the iceberg

'I was sat in a 
single engine plane with the door 20 miles off shore from the coast of 
Alaska in the Chukchi Sea,' said Steven Kazlowski, 43.

'I was completely amazed when we got to 
ice floes where there was nothing but open water to the west and it was 
fantastic to see all the walruses on the ice.'

The walruses rest on the ice, occasionally getting on and off to feed on the sea life below them.

Mr Kazlowski, from Kingston, near 
Seattle, Washington, said there were walruses of all ages on the 
floating ice, including a few large bull walruses.

'The island 
is a safe resting place that acts as a houseboat and moves them around 
their feeding grounds,' he said.

'This way it helps them as they do not over use and feed for too long in a certain area on the sea floor below.

'It was simply an amazing sight and it was definitely something that I have never seen before.

'I like the light, the shapes of the ice, and the massive amount of walruses on them.

'We
were careful to stay far enough away so we didn't disturb them and flew
around the area for a bit before we needed to move on,' he added.
