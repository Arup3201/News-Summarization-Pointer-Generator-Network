'Nincompoop': Ramesh Tawadkar  announced that Goa intends to set up centres to 'cure' homosexuals

An Indian state minister has announced plans to open treatment centres for the LGBT community to 'make them normal', comparing homosexuals to alcoholics.

Ramesh Tawadkar, Goa's minister for sport and youth, said the government in the popular tourist resort would 'cure' homosexuals with 'training and medicines'.

Tawadkar, a representative of right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, sparked outrage with the comments, made during a press conference yesterday. 

'We will make them normal. We will have centres for them, like Alcoholics Anonymous centres,' Tawadkar said, adding that the Goa government would 'train them and give them medicines too'.

Tawadkar made the comments after releasing the Goa state's policy on youth issues which listed the LGBT community as a stigmatised group that needed attention.

Bharatiya Janata Party, is the current majority party in India, and is headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Tawadkar's comments drew widespread criticism and ridicule from gay rights groups who branded them offensive, while hostile remarks were posted on Twitter and other social media.

Anjali Gopalan, founder of sexual health organisation Naz Foundation,  called minister Tawadkar an 'incompetent nincompoop'.

'We should not respond to this kind of stupidity. If anyone needs treatment, it's people like him... he should realise he sounds like a complete fool,' Gopalan said.

Nitin Karani, trustee of the gay rights advocacy group Samapathik Trust, said the minister's comments reflected his ignorance, but at the same time he conceded that the LGBT community needed to 'reach out more to the mainstream for awareness'.

Tawadkar's comments came one day after UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon accused India of fostering intolerance with its laws against gay and lesbian relationships. 

United in support: Members and supporters of the Indian LGBT community march during a Gay Pride Parade in New Delhi in November last year 

Speaking on a visit to the capital New Delhi on Monday night, Ban said he 'staunchly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality'.

'I am proud to stand for the equality of all people -- including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender,' Ban said in an address to a gathering that included India's Nobel peace prize winner Kailash Satyarthi.

Critique: UN's Ban Ki-moon accused India of fostering intolerance with its laws against gay sex

'I speak out because laws criminalising consensual, adult same-sex relationships violate basic rights to privacy and to freedom from discrimination. 

'Even if they are not enforced, these laws breed intolerance.'

India's Supreme Court reimposed a ban on gay sex in late 2013, ruling that responsibility for changing the 1861 law rested with lawmakers and not judges.

Gay sex had been effectively legalised in 2009 when the Delhi High Court ruled that banning 'carnal intercourse against the order of nature' was a violation of fundamental rights. 

Members of the gay community have filed petitions to the top court since the 2013 ruling asking for a review on criminalising gay sex.

Campaigners say the law is rarely used to prosecute homosexual acts, but add that police do use it to harass and blackmail members of their already marginalised community.

Surveys show broad disapproval of homosexuality in India, forcing many gay men and women to live double lives.

Hindu hardliners have often called same-sex relationships a disease and a Western cultural import.

Popular Indian guru Baba Ramdev, who is close to the Bharatiya Janata Party, stirred controversy in 2011 when he said that homosexuality could be 'cured' through yoga.
