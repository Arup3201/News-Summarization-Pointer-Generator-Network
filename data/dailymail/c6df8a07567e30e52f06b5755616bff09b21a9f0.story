No-frills airlines and Europe’s free travel rules are being exploited by Romanian gangs to target Britain, it was revealed yesterday.

Up to 240 crime networks have been identified in the country by Europol, the European criminal intelligence agency.

Its director Rob Wainwright said crooks are using low-cost airlines to target cities for one-day sprees.

Romanian and Bulgarian gangs are thought responsible for 90 per cent of all European card-skimming crimes

Thieves, credit card fraudsters and pickpockets buy cheap tickets to fly in and out in just a few hours.

As a result police are almost powerless to identify those responsible.

An
 estimated 68,000 Romanians live in Britain, but there have been 28,000 
arrests of Romanian people for serious offences in the past five years.

Mr Wainwright said his agency was facing ‘petty criminals operating across multiple jurisdictions’.

He added Romanian and Bulgarian offenders are responsible for 90 per cent of all card-skimming in Europe.

‘We
 have this travelling criminal gang phenomenon that has become much more
 prevalent in the last three or four years; gangs from Lithuania, gangs 
from Poland, gangs from Romania that are operating in 20 or more 
European countries,’ he added.

‘They
 fly on low-cost airlines, do a few hits in one city and get back in 
time for tea. It’s very difficult for local police to respond.’

Europol estimates that Romania’s organised crime gangs account for 6.7 per cent of such networks in Europe.

It claims this figure is out of proportion for a country with a population of 21million.

Experts think gangs have divided Europe into two, along a rough line from Gdansk in Poland to Lisbon in Portugal.

The main crimes being carried out by the travelling gangs are thought to be card-skimming and pickpocketing

Romanian gangs control the north, including Britain,  Bulgarians the south.

Romanian
 criminals are  specialists in pickpocketing and card-skimming, in which
 devices fixed to cash machines steal card details, they say.

The information, combined with a PIN recorded by a hidden camera, is used to drain a victim’s account. Often
 data is used by accomplices in countries that do not require security 
chips, such as the US, Canada and Asia. This summer, police blamed Roma 
gipsies who were living rough on London’s Park Lane for a surge in 
begging, pickpocketing and shoplifting.

Police
 are working closely with colleagues in Romania and other countries to 
uncover suspects’ criminal records, and have won funding for eight 
Romanian and Polish officers to work as liaison officials.

In one case a
 shoplifter was found to be a notorious Romanian criminal wanted for 
more than 60 offences including kidnap and armed robbery.

Rob Wainwright, Europol director

Last
 month, the Home Affairs Committee heard that foreigners with 
convictions overseas can enter Britain, go on a crime spree and leave 
hours later without being caught.

The warning came as a report said staff shortages and a failing screening system have left Britain’s borders in chaos.

The National Audit Office said terrorists and offenders are slipping through the net.

Last year a family of pickpockets who built ‘palaces’ at home in Romania were jailed.

The
 Rostas family preyed on passengers on late-night trains out of London. 
They lived on benefits and stole hundreds of thousands from at least 185
 victims over two years.

Government
 figures suggest the number of Romanians and Bulgarians in the UK has 
gone up by a third in the past year. The number working in the UK rose 
from 91,000 in April to June 2012 to 127,000 during the same period this
 year.

Both countries joined the EU in 2007, and from January 1 their citizens will have full rights to live and work here.

France’s
 foreign minister has called for Romanians and  Bulgarians to be stopped
 from travelling freely. Laurent Fabius said there were security fears 
over crooks using the two impoverished countries as a way into the rest 
of the EU.

A high-profile 
trial in Nancy, eastern France, has heard how children of ten were in a 
‘criminal army’ of Roma immigrants run by a 66-year-old woman.
