Squeeze singer and guitarist Chris Difford escaped a driving ban after pleading it would cause 'exceptional hardship' as he would no longer be able to travel the country playing gigs.

The 57-year-old, who earns up to £100,000 a year performing around the country, was caught on camera doing 88mph on a 70mph road.

And despite already having nine points on his licence, magistrates allowed Difford to keep driving, as a ban would end his 'business' as a solo performer.

The court heard that Difford, who had hits with Up The Junction and Cool for Cats with Squeeze in the late 1970s and 1980s, earns around 80 per cent of his income from live shows.

Difford, from Dulwich, south London, whose former bandmates include Jools Holland, Glenn Tilbrook and Paul Carrack, said he couldn't take his music equipment on public transport and cannot afford a chauffeur.

He said he does not 'get to enjoy' much of his money because his high outgoings, including £30,000 a year school fees for his 16-year-old daughter, are virtually the same as his income.

He said: 'There are so many spokes to what I do, and if I was banned from driving then a fair amount of them would fold - probably the ones that make the most money.

'I don't think I can make any further cutbacks.'

Difford, who reformed Squeeze with Tilbrook in 2007, was caught speeding on the A31 through the New Forest, near Ringwood, Hampshire, last August.

He said he was on his way to Dorset with his partner, who had just been told her ex-husband had died suddenly in France while looking after their three young children.

Difford added: 'There wasn't a particularly huge amount of consideration at the time - it was quite stressful.'

Magistrates' chairman Ann Press said the speeding offence was 'obviously a serious matter'.

However, she accepted the impact a driving ban would have on Difford's family, especially his ability to support his stepchildren 'at a sensitive time in their lives'.

She added: 'But you cannot use this excuse again in court.'

Difford was fined £350, ordered to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge, and given three penalty points.
