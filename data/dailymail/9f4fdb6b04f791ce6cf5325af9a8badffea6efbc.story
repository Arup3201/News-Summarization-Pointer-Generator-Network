Supermarkets are putting customers in danger by demanding price cuts from suppliers that effectively force them to commit fraud, a food safety expert has warned.

And the situation has worsened since the horse meat scandal, according to Professor Chris Elliott, who was asked by the Government to investigate industry practices.

He said the current high street price war means the pressure on suppliers is worse than in January last year, when it emerged that horse meat was being passed off as beef in supermarkets and fast food restaurants.

‘Procurement policies in some food businesses, particularly some of the larger retailers, are a matter of concern,’ he said.

Prof Elliott’s review is highly critical of the supermarkets and suggests the Government and Food Standards Agency were slow to react to the scandal.

The professor, who heads the Institute for Global Food Security, in Belfast, insisted that fraud is far more widespread than just consumers being fooled into eating horse meat.

There has been evidence of cancer-risk chemicals being added to foods, peanuts used in place of other nuts creating the risk of serious allergic reaction, and dirty, condemned meat being sold for human consumption.

A recent FSA survey of 145 lamb takeaway meals found 30 per cent contained other meat. One in five contained no lamb.

The professor said the aggressive approach by the big supermarkets to their suppliers, sometimes demanding food at below the cost of production is opening the door to fraudsters, some of whom are resorting to threats and violence to cover up their activities.

‘The review has been presented with information about threats made by criminals to regulators inspecting food businesses, and by honest businesses trying to compete with cheats,’ he said.

Prof Elliott has called for the establishment of a new Food Crime Unit with police powers to implement a zero-tolerance approach to fraud.

None of the supermarkets, such as Tesco or Asda, brands such as Findus, or restaurant chains like Burger King have been prosecuted for selling horse meat dressed up as beef in burgers, lasagne, Bolognese sauce and other products.

They denied wrongdoing and said they relied on written assurances from their suppliers they were supplying was beef.

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said the Government would accept the review’s recommendations.

The British Retail Consortium, which speaks for supermarkets, said it has taken steps to  prevent a repeat of the horse meat scandal.
