A butcher who was pressured to remove animal carcasses from his shop window has reinstated his display after a huge show of support from the general public.

JBS Family Butchers in Sudbury, Suffolk, say they were forced to take down the display of rabbits, pigs and poultry after people threatened to stop using other nearby shops.

But today staff put the animals back on display after a deluge of support from all over the world.

What else do you expect at a butchers? The shop had been displaying half-butchered animals in its window for several years before two letters published in a local weekly paper led to their removal last week

Assistant manager Richard Nicholson said: 'We have had terrific support from almost everyone.

'Businesses have told us we bring shoppers in, so now hopefully we can go back to being traditional butchers.'

The shop had been displaying half-butchered animals in its window for several years before two letters published in a local weekly paper led to their removal last week.

One writer complaining about the shop window had claimed that the 'needless display of multiple mutilated carcasses' could frighten children.

And following a a claim that shoppers would boycott nearby businesses because of the display, its owner John Sawyer decided that it would have to go to keep the peace.

'We pulled it out because we have to get on with the people in the precinct,' Mr Nicholson added.

After news of the decision emerged, MailOnline's comments boards were inundated with thousands of posts about it - the vast majority in favour of restoring the display and criticising the objectors.

It became a major talking point and was held up as the latest clash in the cultural war between the metropolis and the countryside.

Today the shop's display of seasonal produce - including half a pig, a goose and six hares - was reinstated behind a sign that read: 'We would like to give a massive THANK YOU for your overwhelming support.'.

One shopper said: 'The complaints were just ridiculous - this is a country market town and you would expect a butcher's shop to display what he was selling.

'It's not neatly-wrapped little packages like you find supermarkets - customers know exactly what they are getting and where it has come from.'

Mr Nicholson added: 'We've had such a positive response from all over the country and the world. It's been a little bit overwhelming, but the public has decided that it goes back in, so it's back in.'

He said the incident had shown 'that the country seems to like the traditional butchers and that the game and meat we hang in the window aren't such a bad thing'.
