Supermarket wines have once again proven that they are not to be sniffed at as own-brand bottles bag 360 medals at the Golden Aisle International Wine Challenge.

Winners included a £5.25 Aldi sherry and a £6 Asda sauvignon blanc as well as Marks & Spencer, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, and Morrisons all picking up gold awards.

The IWC (International Wine Challenge)
assesses every wine 'blind' and judges each for its faithfulness to 
style, region and vintage. 

Good value: There's no need to splash out on fancy wines after supermarket own brands win gold awards

Each award-winning wine is tasted on at 
least three separate occasions by a minimum of ten different judges, 
including Masters of Wine.

This year, the IWC hosted two tasting events for the first time, Tranche 1 in November 2013 and 
Tranche 2 in April 2014, to accommodate the different production and 
sales schedules across the industry, and give winemakers two opportunities to enter their wines - with the second round producing more supermarket winners than ever before.

Marks & Spencer held on to its superior status - being awarded the highest number of gold medals for six wines, continuing its 2013 success (when it was named IWC Supermarket of the Year).

Surprisingly,
 sherry was instrumental in the high-end supermarket's success, with two Spanish varieties earning gold with both costing just £8.

Marks
 & Spencer Champagne Charles Orban Blanc de Noirs at a slightly 
pricier £30 also took home a gold. The brand picked up a 
total of 50 silver medals and 82 bronze medals for its wine range.

Marks and Spencer's Spanish wines both retailing at £8 were awarded gold medals

If you're not quite able to stretch to M&S bubbly prices, then Sainsbury's and Waitrose are a happy compromise with both supermarkets delighting the judges with their great-value fizz and each receiving four gold awards.

Sainsbury's 2013 Taste the Difference Conegliano Prosecco Superiore Brut (£9.99) and Waitrose Blanc de Blancs Brut Champagne (£19.99) both received gold medals.

Waitrose 
proved to be Champagne champion, with three gold medals, the 
Waitrose Blanc de Blancs Brut Champagne, the Blanc de Noirs Brut 
(£21.99) and the 2004 Brut Special Reserve (£30.99).

And Sainsbury's received 17 silver and 38 bronze awards, while Waitrose was awarded seven silver and 11 bronze.

Tesco received gold medals for its Dessert Semillon (L) and North Row Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (R)

Cheaper supermarket brands also highly impressed the judges with Tesco taking home three gold medals for its dessert wines and Sauvignon Blancs and Morrisons receiving equal applause, with three golds for its sweet and sherry wines.

Aldi continues its good reputation for high-quality at reasonable prices. The low-priced supermarket bagged a gold medal for its Aldi Caversham Cream Sherry, at only £5.25. Aldi also received a gold for its Minarete Ribera Del Duero Roble 2012 as well as four silver winners and 13 bronze.

Asda 
received a single gold for its Asda Koru Sauvignon Blanc 2012 from New 
Zealand, priced at £6. The supermarket also received five silver medals 
and 20 bronzes.

Finally,
local supermarket brand, the Co-operative was awarded five silver medals, and a total of 12 bronze for wines from its 
own-brand range.

Charles
 Metcalfe, Co-Chairman of the IWC commented says he was astounded 
by the quality of the supermarket wines on offer and agrees they are 
worthy winners.

The IWC says that the high quality of supermarket wine means we will no longer be embarrassed to take an own-brand bottle to a dinner party

'The 
calibre of wines from the supermarket own-brand ranges has been 
phenomenal this year, and it is great to see them picking up top prizes 
across all styles. From delicious Champagnes to tremendous Sherries, 
shoppers can find some lovely wines in the aisles,' he said.

'Each
 year the quality of the supermarket own-brand wines gets better and 
better. Long gone are the days when you might be embarrassed to take an 
own-brand wine to a dinner party. Our IWC medal stickers offer a handy 
guide to picking the best wines in the aisle.'

Charles
 continued to say that the competition couldn't be fairer, and that 
winning medals at the contest can give these supermarket brands a real 
boost.

'The
 International Wine Challenge is committed to rigorous and fair tasting 
and has subsequently earned its reputation as the most well-respected 
wine competition in the world. By hosting two separate tasting events 
across the year, wines are given the best chance to perform well, 
wherever they're from.

'If
 a shopper sees an IWC medal sticker on a bottle of wine, its quality 
can be trusted, as it has been selected by some of the world's best 
tasters. Whether you are a wine novice or an experienced wine-drinker, 
our stickers can help you find a great wine every time.'
