Sir Cliff Richard was far from the circling media helicopters and the indignity of a police raid yesterday.

As his lavish apartment in Sunningdale in Berkshire was searched, he was in Portugal where he had been staying at his magnificent cream-painted villa.

He always stays at the estate on the Algarve from the end of the Wimbledon in July until the grapes ripen at the end of September. There is a vineyard near the house and he takes great pride in his award-winning wine.

The singer, now 73, thinks of Portugal as his sanctuary. He sees almost no one when he is there – certainly none of his many showbusiness friends – and enjoys the peace of his manicured garden with its rows of pleasingly symmetrical cypresses, tended by his gardener.

His most famous romance: Cliff Richard with Sue Barker in June 1982. He said later that he had seriously considered asking the tennis star to marry him

His £3million Algarve farm and his £6million plantation-style villa in Barbados are his pride and joy. He spends more time there than he does at the apartment that was raided yesterday, which he bought in 2008.

He shrugged recently that he spends 'a week here, a week there' in Britain and it has been revealed that he is not even a UK resident any longer as he spends so little time in the country. He is domiciled instead in Barbados, where he spends each winter.

That's not to say that he hasn't taken care over his home in Sunningdale. It is, like everything else in his life, very beautiful and done to his own particular tastes.

As he was spending more and more time abroad, he decided in 2006 that he should move from his large home of three decades in St George's Hill, Weybridge, Surrey, to somewhere far smaller and requiring less upkeep.

Estate agents were told that he wanted somewhere 'opulent, secure and convenient'.

At first he moved into an ugly yellow-brick bungalow on the Wentworth Estate, where his neighbours included entertainer Bruce Forsyth. But that was a temporary move, and he soon settled in the Charters building in Sunningdale, the former HQ of De Beers diamonds, now converted into luxury apartments.

Cliff's £3million apartment is in the spectacular art deco mansion complex with its Portland stone columns and tall bronze-framed windows.

The main house was built in 1938 by Frank Parkinson, a millionaire from Doncaster who had made his fortune in electrical motors.

After the war it served as the headquarters for De Beers, before becoming a jumble of offices and factory units, until it was taken over by developer who converted it and two other buildings into apartments.

The apartments all have marble floors and walls clad in walnut panelling. The kitchens are oak and chrome and the bathrooms granite, with heated floors. Huge plasma televisions are hidden behind mirrors. There is a spa, gym, tennis courts and a swimming pool. 

First love: The singer himself has acknowledged Carol Costa, the wife of his Shadows bandmate Jet Harris, as the only woman he has ever shared a bed with

Sir Cliff has had little cause to be displeased, except for a complaint that the gardens were not properly maintained at one time. He was spotted with a party of 11 friends and family at his local Indian restaurant, The Tiger's Pad, in Sunningdale, celebrating his 70th birthday in 2010.

It was a typically down to earth choice for the singer, who is known for being cautious about money – except, perhaps, when it comes to property.

Michael Ball of Savills, who sold the apartment to Sir Cliff, said at the time: 'About 85 per cent of our buyers have a second property abroad and are decanting from bigger houses in the area for something less onerous to run.' 

Love affairs: At 22, Sir Cliff had a passionate affair with actress Una Stubbs, then 24, (left) and has said that he came close to marrying Sue Barker (right) in the 1980s

In an interview with the Mail in 2011, Sir Cliff explained that despite the 'Peter Pan of Pop' image, he had been prompted to change his life as he was getting older and taking life a little easier. He said: 'It's a matter of having more time to myself and enjoying a more comfortable life. For instance, I used to take just three weeks' holiday a year.

'Now I go to Portugal for a couple of months to enjoy my farmhouse and vineyards there. I spend another couple of months at my house in Barbados, where the view over the Caribbean is to die for.'

He has said that he will sell his Barbados home, where Tony and Cherie Blair have holidayed as guests, when he is 75 and move to a place with less demanding upkeep. 

Companion: Sir Cliff has described former Roman Catholic priest John McElynn (left) as a 'companion' and a 'blessing'. Mr McElynn manages the singer's property portfolio

He also has a home in New York. All his properties are managed by a former Roman Catholic priest, John McElynn, who has lived with him ever since his manager, Bill Latham, who shared his home for 30 years, moved out.

Sir Cliff said: 'I can't stand travelling alone, eating alone, or being on my own. When Bill and I lived together, there was always speculation about our relationship, but nobody realised his girlfriend was living with us, too. They just thought, 'Uh-oh, two guys living together.'

When Bill moved out, it was just because he and his girlfriend wanted to be alone together.'

In 1993, he had told a South Bank Show special: 'If you're not married it doesn't mean you're gay. I'm happy, I'm settled but I'm not married.' Sir Cliff has had a handful of serious romances since losing his virginity at 18 to Carol Costa – who married Jet Harris, bass player in his backing band The Shadows.

A biography said she was the only woman he has ever slept with. He said later: 'I loved Carol and there was a mutual physical attraction. She looked like Brigitte Bardot, who I had a thing about at the time. It turned out to be nothing very much at all and I made a big mistake.'

After a romance with Australian dancer Delia Wicks in 1961, there a fling with actress Una Stubbs and a liaison with dancer Jackie Irving. The relationship with Miss Stubbs began on the set of his 1964 film Wonderful Life.

Their brief romance was not revealed until two decades later, when both insisted it had amounted to nothing more than kissing, cuddling and holding hands.

She said he was 'very important in my life and a very close friend ever since,' and he said: 'We loved each other madly, we had a romantic attachment, but it wasn't a sordid affair.' Most famously there was Cliff's romance in the Eighties with tennis player Sue Barker. In 2008 he told an interviewer: 'I seriously contemplated asking her to marry me, but in the end I realised that I didn't love her quite enough to commit the rest of my life to her.'

Now, all that is in the past and Sir Cliff, worth £40million after more than 50 years in the business and 16 No 1 hits, has finally started slowing down – even though, to some extent, he remains financially anxious.

'I've never lost that basic human need to feel secure,' he said. 'I still wake up sometimes in a cold sweat, wondering if I've got enough.'

His financial anxiety may partly be the result of his humble beginnings. He was born Harry Webb in Howra, outside Calcutta, in 1940.

His parents came to England in 1948, and were described as destitute at first. Cliff and his sisters, Donna and Jacqui and Joan, lived in a single room in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, while his father sought work.

Sir Cliff has devoted his working life to finding homes where he is truly secure.

After the events of yesterday, that security and comfort must suddenly feel a little precarious.
