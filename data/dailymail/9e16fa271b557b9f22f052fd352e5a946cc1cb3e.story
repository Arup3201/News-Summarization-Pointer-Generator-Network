Their revealing gowns and clingy dresses might not appear to offer much room for expansion, but celebrities tucked into a delicious three-course meal at the Golden Globes last night.

A-listers including George Clooney, Keira Knightley, Eddie Redmayne and Benedict Cumberbatch feasted on mouth-watering Californian-grown fresh produce, which included a Waldorf salad and filet mignon.

As well as quaffing their way through 600 bottles of wine and 400 magnums of Moet & Chandon Champagne at the Beverly Hilton hotel in California, guests sipped on signature cocktail Moet Sunset Starlet, made with Moet & Chandon Rose Imperial, dry Curacao and orange bitters.

John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Helen Mirren, Taylor Hackford and Jessica Chastain were among the celebrity guests tucking into a three-course meal at the Golden Globes at the Hilton Hotel last night

The main course was a duo of onion-marinated filet mignon and slow-baked Arctic chard 

There were also 1,500 Champagne minis served on the red carpet. 

Created by the hotel's executive chef, Troy N Thompson, and prepared by 40 chefs, this year's awards menu  - which also included options for vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free, fish-only and double-meat eaters - highlighted fresh Californian ingredients with a twist.  

The three-course feast kicked off with a modern Waldorf salad. Julienne of apple, celery and grape in a lemon emulsion drizzled with lemon juice and egg white instead of traditional mayonnaise.

The fruit slivers were placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, topped with croutons and drizzled with walnut oil.
