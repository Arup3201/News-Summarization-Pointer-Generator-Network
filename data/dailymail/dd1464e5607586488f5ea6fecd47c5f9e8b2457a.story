Yellow Pages will rebrand its digital side as Hibu, it was announced last night as the directory service posted an annual loss of £1.4billion.

Printed products, such as the Yellow Pages, will not change their identity but parent company Yell Group and digital offerings such as Yell.com and eMarketplace will fall under the new moniker.

Chief executive Mike Pocock even admitted that Hibu - pronounced 'high boo' - means nothing.

Name change: Yellow Pages will rebrand its digital side as Hibu, it was announced last night as the directory service posted an annual loss of £1.4bn

But he added that the word tells a 'story' and the logo's soft-shouldered edges represents the 'people behind the identity'.

He said: 'It's a word. If you go back 15 to 20 years, Google and Yahoo didn't mean anything. It's how you support the brands.'

Shares in Yell slumped 22 per cent after the firm post huge losses yesterday and warned that it may breach its banking covenants this year.

The firm blamed ‘increasingly difficult trading conditions’ but plans to win new digital revenues from small businesses.

Yell struggles under debts of £2.2billion built up through a string of online directory acquisitions made in the early part of the century.

The company swung to a full-year loss of £1.42billion from a pre-tax profit of £66.3million, largely due to a £1.59billion writedown in the value of businesses it had previously bought in the US, the UK, Spain, Chile and Peru.

A spokesman said: ‘The decline in print and online directory revenues has a large adverse effect on the earnings of the group.’

Yell’s annual sales slipped 14 per cent to £1.6billion, though it did manage to pay down £565million on its debt pile.

The firm has appointed Goldman Sachs and Greenhill as advisers to open talks with its syndicate of 300 banks to address its debt burden, in a deal that could include a debt-for-equity swap.

The majority of Yell’s debt matures in April 2014, although it plans to reach an agreement by March 2013.

Shares in Yell fell 0.75p to 2.41p overnight, valuing the firm at just £56.8million.
