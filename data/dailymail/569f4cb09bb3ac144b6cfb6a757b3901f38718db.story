Kate Upton has thanked former Vogue Paris editor, Carine Roitfeld for helping her make the transition from glamor to high-fashion model.

The blonde bombshell, who shot to fame as a bikini-clad Sports Illustrated magazine star, told Page Six: 'She was the first editor who put me on the cover actually wearing clothing.'

Indeed, after Miss Upton, 21, appeared on the front of Ms Roitfeld's magazine, CR Fashion Book in the fall of 2012 wearing a knitted V-neck sweater she went on to grace the covers of Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Elle and Vanity Fair.

She got to show her appreciation to Ms Roitfeld, 59, on Tuesday night at the Fashion Group International's 30th annual 'Night Of Stars' awards gala held in New York.

The five-foot-ten-inch Michigan native presented the famed stylist and writer with a media award.

The two were later pictured smiling arm-in-arm as they posed up for photographs together.

Before landing the gig with Ms Roitfeld Miss Upton thought she was destined to be snubbed by the fashion world.

A casting director for Victoria's Secret famously branded her image 'too obvious' and said she would 'never use' her for the lingerie brand's famous runway show.

'She's like a Page 3 girl...like a footballer's wife, with the too-blond hair and that kind of face that anyone with enough money can go out and buy.'

But luckily, Ms Roitfeld, a longtime editor of Paris Vogue and an industry trendsetter, saw her potential.

When she launched her highly-anticipated fashion magazine she picked the voluptuous beauty as her cover star with the legendary Bruce Weber photographing her in black and white.

'I didn't want a normal model,' Ms Roitfeld told The Daily Beast at the time.

'I wanted someone with a sensual body, someone who could be a mother for all these babies ... I would not say she's a controversial model, but she's not a classic model. And I like that.'

The rest of the industry quickly followed suit and this September Miss Upton was officially crowned 2013's Model of the Year.

Now she says she has her sights set on being an actress. Speaking about her role in the upcoming movie The Other Woman alonside Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann, the model said she definitely sees herself doing more films.

'I'm not really sure what I want my next role to be, but I just really want to feel confident and feel like it's a good choice for me because I'm such a new actress,' she told UPI.
