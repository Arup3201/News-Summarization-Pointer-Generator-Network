Self-proclaimed 'Tiger Mom' Amy Chua has denied accusations she is racist for arguing eight ethnic groups - including her own - are superior to others.

The Chinese-American, who caused controversy in 2011 by claiming Chinese women were better mothers, has released a new book which states eight cultural groups have traits which make them more successful than most.

'There is nothing racial about it. Successful groups include people of all different skin colors,' Chua said, according to The Sunday Times.

'There are black and Hispanic groups outperforming the national average; there are white and Asian groups mired in poverty . . . Wilful blindness to facts is rarely good policy.'

'It's not racist': Chinese-American Amy Chua and her Jewish husband Jed Rubenfeld defended their new book 'Triple Package' on the Today Show this morning

The 51-year-old Yale professor and her Jewish husband, Jed Rubenfeld, this morning appeared on TODAY to slam critics who say their latest book - 'The Triple Package' - is 'full blown eugenics pushing racist'.

'The focus on groups is what's making everybody so upset,' Chua told TODAY's Savannah Guthrie.

'The groups actually change over time. The groups successful today won't be 10 years from now.'

The couple, who have two children, controversially argue that certain groups do much better than others in America because of three elements: a superiority complex, insecurity and impulse control.

These 'superior' groups include Cubans, Nigerians, Jews, Mormons, Indians, Lebanese, and Chinese-Americans.  

Chinese Chua and Jewish Rubenfeld belong to two of the exceptional eight 
groups.

Critics say the book perpetuates racial stereotypes, but the high-powered pair said it simply takes a look at what triggers human motivation.

'Any time you talk about groups in America, there's going to be sensitivity, but our book is the polar opposite of racist... (it) is written to prove that what propels success has nothing to do with race,' Rubenfeld, also a Yale law professor, said.

'It’s not innate, it’s not biological; it comes down to three qualities that are open to anyone of any background.'

The superiority complex is a belief, which a parent can instil, that you're exceptional. Insecurity is a feeling that what you've done is not good enough, while impulse control is the ability to resist temptation.

The couple claim that the combination of these traits - 'the triple package' - can help some groups accelerate in American culture, but these are not innate, biological qualities.

Chua believes anyone can be successful but must help themselves.

Chua became a media sensation in 2011 when The Wall Street Journal published an extract from her book 'Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother'.

Although she was raised in the Midwest, Chua used her Chinese heritage and some of the worst stereotypes of Chinese women - cold, rigid and hostile towards their own children - to criticize Western methods of parenting.

Chua wrote unabashedly about calling one of her two daughters 'garbage' for being rude and refusing to let her girls watch TV or participate in school plays or have sleepovers.

While it became a best-seller, Chua’s book was roundly criticized for being 'racist' and perpetuating negative stereotypes about race.

Chua's latest book takes her premise a step further, with commentators saying its exploration of family seeks to play on the growing fear of the middle-class never booming again.

Controversially, Chua and her husband say that African-Americans don't make the superior race list because the Civil Rights Movement destroyed their chance of any superiority.

'In this paradoxical sense, equality isn’t fair to African-Americans,' they write.

'Superiority is the one narrative that America has relentlessly denied or ground out of its black population.'

Chua and her husband ultimately declare that the point of their book 'is the promise of a day when there are no longer any successful groups in the United States - only successful individuals.'
