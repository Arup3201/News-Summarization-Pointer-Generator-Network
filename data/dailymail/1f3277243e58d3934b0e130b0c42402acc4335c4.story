A group of hackers has exposed the mobile phone numbers of 4.6 million U.S. Snapchat users, to 'raise awareness of the app's security issues'.

The anonymous hackers released the database a week after Snapchat claimed it had introduced measures to fix a security glitch, which it was told could result in users' personal information being put at risk.

The group has released the database via a website SnapchatDB, giving people the option to download the list of usernames and phone numbers as well as their location.

A group of anonymous hackers released the phone numbers of 4.6 million Snapchat users on New Year's Day in the U.S. to 'raise awareness' of the site's security vulnerabilties

The hackers redacted the last two digits of each number, claiming the stunt was designed to 'raise awareness' of the issue.

The group have left the usernames in their entirety adding that people tend to use the same username across the internet.

In a statement on the site Snapchat DB, the group of hackers said: 'This information was acquired through the recently patched Snapchat exploit and is being shared with the public to raise awareness on the issue.

'The company was too reluctant at patching the exploit until they knew it was too late and companies that we trust with our information should be more careful when dealing with it.

'For now, we have censored the last two digits of the phone numbers in order to minimise spam and abuse.'

The group said it would consider releasing the original database, without the redacted digits, 'under certain circumstances'.

The hackers redacted the last two digits of each phone number on the list to avoid hacked account holders being abused. However, they later said in a statement they would consider releasing the original database 'under certain circumstances'

On Christmas Day Australian security research group, Gibson Security revealed details of a security hole affecting the Snapchat site.

The security group revealed how the vulnerability on the site could be manipulated and added that Snapchat did not respond to their warnings when they raised the issue months ago.

Gibson Security tweeted that it had no involvement in the release of the users' personal information.

The tweet said: 'We know nothing about SnapchatDB, but it was a matter of time til something like that happened.'

After Gibson published its findings Snapchat said it took user privacy seriously and replied in a blogpost.

It said: 'Theoretically, if someone 
were able to upload a huge set of phone numbers, like every number in an
 area code, or every possible number in the US, they could create a 
database of the results and match usernames to phone numbers that way.

'Over
 the past year weâ€™ve implemented various safeguards to make it more 
difficult to do. We recently added additional counter-measures and 
continue to make improvements to combat spam and abuse.'

On Christmas Day an Australian security firm Gibson Security revealed a vulnerability with the site, which could lead to users' personal information being leaked. Snapchat said it had taken action to address the issue

The MailOnline has contacted Snapchat for comment on the release of the SnapchatDB database - they have yet to respond.

Snapchat is a photo messaging app. It allows users to take photos, record videos and add messages and drawings.

Messages are known as snaps and users can set a time limit on how long recipients can view their snap, ranging from one to 10 seconds. The snap is then deleted from the recipient's phone and erased from Snapchat's servers.

Google Play lists the app as having been downloaded between 10 million and 50 million times.
