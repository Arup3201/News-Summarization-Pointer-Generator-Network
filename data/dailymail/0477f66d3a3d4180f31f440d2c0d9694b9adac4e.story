Popular: Lego saw sales rise 25 per cent, boosted by the popularity of Lego Friends (pictured), which sold so well production units were unable to keep up with demand

Sales for Danish toymaker Lego soared 25 per cent last year, thanks in part to its new series of building blocks designed for girls.

The privately owned company today said that on revenue of 23.4 billion kroner (£2.7 billion) its net profits grew 38 per cent, to 5.6 billion kroner (£650 million).

The company, based in western Denmark, said the Lego Star Wars and Lego Ninjago series remained among the more popular, but it was a novel rollout for girls, Lego Friends, that sold better than expected - to the extent that production units were unable to keep pace with demand.

Chief executive Joergen Vig Knudstorp said Lego had shown it can develop toys that children across world 'put at the top of their wish lists in 2012.'

In the United States, Lego Friends surpassed early projections, with its sales eventually increasing three times more than expected, Lego said.

The new line, which includes mini-figures in pink, a dream house with a pool, and a beauty shop, was criticised by some US consumer groups as reinforcing gender stereotypes.

Lego said its share of the total US toy market has quadrupled in five years. As of the end of 2012 it was 7.9 per cent, up 1.6 percentage points from the previous year.

Markets in North America, Asia and Europe delivered 'impressive' sales results, the toy maker said, while growth in some southern European markets were 'more moderate but still in healthy single digits.'

The company, which sells products in more than 130 countries, expects sales to continue to climb in 2013, but at a slower rate due to global economic uncertainty.

Lego is not publicly listed but has published earning reports since 1997. It does not release quarterly figures.

Lego said its Star Wars range remained as popular as ever, which helped its net profits grow 38 per cent

Toys: The Lego Ninjago range also remained popular in 2012, when the Danish toymaker saw its sales soar 25 per cent
