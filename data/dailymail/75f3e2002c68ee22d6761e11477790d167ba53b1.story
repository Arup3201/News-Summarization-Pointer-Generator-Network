I had not long been back at Arsenal when we went to Anfield early in the season. I was trying to convince George Graham I deserved to be in Arsenal’s back four — I’m not sure that game was the best audition!

Everything went wrong. We knew a bit about Robbie Fowler, but nobody saw that hat-trick coming.

I have to take most (if not all) the blame for the first goal. I gave away a free-kick and then at the set-piece I was supposed to mark Ian Rush.  

Opener: Keown gave away the free-kick that led to the first goal, and lost his marker who provided the assist

I ended up too far away, made a late dive to get my head on the ball and almost got away with it but it dropped to Fowler and from that range, he couldn’t miss. 

The second was an excellent finish but the third had some good fortune about it. 

Fowler, Dave Seaman and I all went for the ball but somehow it squirmed through for Fowler to tap in.

Liverpool weren't the force they had been but when they got their teeth into you at Anfield, the roof lifted off the ground. 

When that third goal hit the net, the place erupted. Not a good day at the office.

Third: Keown said that when the third went in 'the roof lifted off the ground' at Anfield
