'Cristiano Ronaldo and probably Luis Suarez a close second,' said Rooney.

Having shared a pitch with a host of world-class stars during his 10 years at Old Trafford, Rooney also claims Ronaldo and Paul Scholes are the best players he has played alongside.

However, the 28-year-old was unable to separate the two and said: 'The best player I've ever played with is between two - Ronaldo and Paul Scholes. Scholesy controlled the game and passed the ball around but in terms of winning games - Cristiano Ronaldo.'

Meanwhile, having scored his fair share 
of brilliant goals since bursting onto the scene for Everton aged just 
16, Rooney was asked which of his strikes was his favourite and said: 
'The overhead against Man City, and Internationally the goal against 
Holland.'

With Manchester United lining up Louis van Gaal as the club's new boss, Rooney admits he is unsure whether he will ever go into management once his playing days are over.

Asked whether or not he could see himself on the touchline, the 28-year-old answered: 'Honestly I don't know, I could be a manager at some point. It would depend on circumstances in my life and what chapter of my life I was at with my family and which club it would be.'
