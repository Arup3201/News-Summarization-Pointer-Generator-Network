A former Bosnian international goalkeeper is set for a long ban from football after punching a referee in a second division game.

Romeo Mitrovic, who played once for his country in 2006 in a 2-0 defeat to South Korea, was in goal for HNK Branitelj in the second tier of Bosnian football, when he was shown a yellow card while the ball was out of play.

The 35-year-old keeper was outraged, throwing a huge right hook at the referee, who did well to duck under the punch.

While the official, showing a mix of surprising calm and an obvious desire to get away from the furious player, made his way to the centre circle, team-mates and opponents alike had to hold Mitrovic back.

Eventually Mitrovic, still attempting to get near to the referee, was shown a red card and escorted down the tunnel, while the game was abandoned. 

Branitelj were 1-0 down at the time, thanks to a headed goal for opponents FK Buducnost, for which Mitrovic thought he was fouled.
