The secret 'first son' of Lucian Freud has lost his bid to secure a share of the artist's £96million fortune following a dispute in the High Court.

Paul McAdam Freud is legally accepted, but not proven, to be Freud's first son from a relationship with fashion student Katherine McAdam in the 1950s.

Mr McAdam Freud, brother of fashion designer Bella Freud, was fighting a clause in his father's will which meant he would inherit none of the money.

He was also fighting a clause that meant only two people will ever know exactly who the artist's estate is handed to.

At the time of Freud's death three years ago, Diana Rawstrom, his trusted solicitor, and Rose Pearce, one of his daughters, were the sole beneficiaries.

After legacies and taxes the pair inherited an estimated £42million.

But they have since revealed Freud secretly instructed them to pass on money to a list of others, without ever revealing their identities or the sums of money involved.

Mr McAdam Freud tried to lift the lid on this secrecy by arguing that part of the will was illegitimate, but he failed in his attempt today.

If he had succeeded it would also have meant Freud would have died largely intestate, and his millions would have been handed out to his next of kin, a complicated task given that the exact number of his children is unknown - though the court heard that it was 'at least 14'.

Lucian's only legitimate offspring, two daughters named Annie and Annabel, came from his marriage to Kitty Garman - a muse of his whom he married in 1948.

However, he had another four children by  Suzy Boyt, a student he had met at the Slade school of art in the Fifties, and another four, including Paul McAdam Freud and sisters Jane, Bella and Esther, by Kathleen McAdam.

After Kathleen left him in 1966, it is said that he barely saw any of the family for 20 years.

The Greek sculptor Vassilakis Takis, a close friend of Lucian's, estimated that he had at least 500 lovers during his lifetime, while family friends insist that his children could number as high as 30.

Revealing the true beneficiaries of Freud's will could have lifted the lid on some of the mystery, but following today's ruling, only Mrs Rawstrom and Mrs Pearce will know who receives the money. 

Speaking at the High Court today, the judge said he could ‘readily understand’ Mr MacAdam Freud’s concerns about the secrecy of the will, from which he stood to gain nothing.

‘There is a lot of money involved here, so I fully understand these are important issues,’ he said, before ruling that Mrs Rawstrom’s and Mrs Pearce’s interpretation of the will made ‘common sense’.

Freud made his fortune through his portrait work, thought by many to be the best of his generation. His most famous work, 'Benefits Supervisor Sleeping' (pictured), sold for a world-record $33.8million in 2008

Freud's portraits often featured nudes of  his friends and family. This portrait is of his daughter, Bella

Although, on the face of it, the will appeared to give the £42 million to Mrs Rawstrom and Mrs Pearce ‘absolutely’, they had since made clear that they held the money only as trustees and were bound to distribute the cash under a cloak of confidentiality.

‘They wish to respect the deceased’s wishes not to disclose the terms of the fully secret trust to anyone who is not a beneficiary,’ their barrister, Michael Furness QC, earlier told the court.

The judge said it had ‘at one time been disputed’ that Mr McAdam Freud was the artist’s son from his relationship with fashion student, Katherine McAdam, in the 1950s.

But it had been accepted, at least for the purposes of the court hearing, that he was ‘another of Lucian Freud’s children’.

By his will, the artist specifically left a £2.5m tax-free gift and a house in west London to his assistant of more than 20 years, David Dawson.

A second clause instructed Mrs Pearce and Mrs Rawstron to dispose of ‘chattels’ on the basis of instructions given during his life.

One of Freud’s works was also given to the National Gallery in lieu of inheritance tax.
