Arsenal want £12m from Manchester United for Thomas Vermaelen.

Two summers ago, that would have looked cheap, now it is another expensive gamble.

Vermaelen’s form has been in steady, inexplicable, decline of late.

Big sum: Arsenal want a figure of £12million from Manchester United for the signature of Thomas Vermaelen

On the stretch: Vermaelen is currently away at the World Cup in Brazil with Belgium

From a position as captain, he lost his starting place as a centre half, and could barely make the team as reserve left back.

If Vermaelen can recover the form of his earliest years at Arsenal he will be a snip.

If not, this is more good money after bad at Old Trafford.

Worry: Vermaelen looks to be in decline and has often been injured for Arsenal

On the way: Arsene Wenger seems happy to lose Arsenal's former captain
