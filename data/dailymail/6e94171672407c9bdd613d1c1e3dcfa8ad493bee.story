Four of the five people killed in a small-plane crash north of Denver were identified Monday as a woman and her three children.

The Weld County coroner says Tori Rains-Wedan, 41, and her three sons, 15-year-old Mason Wedan and 11-year-old twins Austin and Hunter, died in the crash Sunday, The Boulder Daily Camera reported.

Rains-Wedan's boyfriend, Oliver Frascona, was the pilot of the Piper PA-46 and was also killed.

The plane crashed about 11:50 a.m. in a grassy field near the Erie Municipal Airport, about 20 miles north of Denver, officials told the newspaper. 

Rains-Wedan owned Educated Minds, a company that offers education classes to real estate agents, the newspaper reported.

Frascona's neighbor, Tom Van Lone, told the newspaper 'He was a really nice guy and a good pilot with a lot of training hours. He flew a couple of times a week.'

Grief counselors would be provided to students and staff Tuesday at the schools the boys have attended, Boulder Valley School District spokesman Briggs Gamblin told The Daily Camera.

Jan Culver told the newspaper she witnessed the plane flying 'really, really low.'

'We heard it sputtering,' she said. 'Then there was no sound. We knew it was a crash.'

Culver also told the newspaper she saw 'bad injuries' when she approached the plane.

 

The six-passenger plane crashed a few hundred yards northwest of the runway, Erie Police Cmdr. Lee Mathis told the Associated Press. Three people were declared dead at the scene, and two were taken to hospitals. 

Friend Chris Mygatt told the newspaper Frascona, who was a lawyer for Frascona, Joiner, Goodman and Greenstein P.C., 'was as close as our industry would ever get to a celebrity in the business.'

'He was larger than life,' he also said. 'He was an excellent presenter. He made our annual classes vibrant and real and relevant. He was very generous with his time and always available to answer questions.'

In a memorial on its website, the law firm said in part 'We grieve with the real estate community in the sudden and tragic passing of our friend and colleague, Oliver Frascona. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and loved ones.

'Oliver was a brilliant legal strategist, and a highly sought-after speaker on real estate and agency law.'

Frascona's partner, Jon Goodman, said in a statement to The Denver Post 'Everyone on that plane touched the lives of many. The law firm morns their tragic death. May they all live on in the memories of those that loved them.'

The newspaper reported that NTSB records show the airport was the scene of three crashes in 2013 and two in 2012. None of those incidents had a fatality.
