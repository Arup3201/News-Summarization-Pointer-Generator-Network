Weed with Eaze: Startup company Eaze promises to 'dispatch a professional caregiver' to deliver prompt delivery of a range of different strains of cannabis to clients across San Francisco

A smartphone app that hand-delivers marijuana to customers' doors within ten minutes has been branded the 'Uber of weed' after it was launched last week.

Startup company Eaze promises to 'dispatch a professional caregiver' to deliver prompt delivery of a range of different strains of cannabis to clients across San Francisco.

They claim to be able to deliver the package within ten minutes to anyone who lives in the Bay Area after they register for the 'on-demand healthcare delivery service'.

Within 
days of its launch, the firm was widely compared to Uber - an app which 
allows customers to book and track taxis on their mobile phone.

Eaze offers the same technology, letting users watch their caregiver's progress as they drive to their home.

Delivery
 is a free service for patients, with money to pay drivers reportedly 
coming from revenue that Eaze takes in from dispensaries for generating 
extra business.

'We're offering the revolution of 
on-demand services for medical marijuana patients,' said Eaze CEO and 
founder Keith McCarty, formerly an executive at enterprise social 
network Yammer, which was acquired by Microsoft for $1.2 billion.

He says 
his app has automated the generally 'slow, cumbersome, and 
unpredictable' process of checking dispensaries and confirming 
eligibility.'

'The
 process of acquiring medical marijuana can be slow, cumbersome and 
unpredictable,' he said. 'Often patients have to search multiple 
dispensaries manually each time they order as stock often varies.

'Verification
 of medical eligibility can take 24 hours and has to be repeated with 
each dispensary. Eaze’s technology automates all of that so each patient
 can have a consistent, comfortable experience -- and can focus on 
getting better.'

Classified: Marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I drug by the government, but pot entrepreneurship is growing. So is legalization of marijuana - currently 23 states and the District of Columbia allow medical pot use

Each driver will start a shift by picking up a kit at a dispensary preloaded with 8 ounces of pot - the legal limit they can carry. Typical sales are one-eighth ounce, or 3.5 grams, which sells for about $50.

'Having (enough supply for) 64 deliveries on them means they can get to patients in an average time of 10 minutes,' McCarty said. 'That's a compelling value proposition.'

Eaze will 
verify customers' legal rights to buy marijuana by reviewing images of 
their doctors' notes and drivers' licenses, submitted online.

Drivers'
 cars will be unmarked - important because they must accept cash for 
deliveries, due to strict federal rules regulating banks and credit card
 companies.

The
 service will be in operation daily from 8 a.m. to midnight. Drivers 
will make $10 per delivery. McCarty wouldn't say how much Eaze would 
collect as a commission from dispensaries.

Drivers
 must pass criminal and driving background checks and must themselves be
 medical marijuana users so they are legally allowed to carry 8 ounces.

'We want them to be able to relate to the patients,' McCarty said.

McCarty says they won't drive under the influence - and that the company is considering some form of drug tests for employees.

'We don't have a protocol yet, but plan to do it,' he said.

According to McCarty, Eaze carries insurance in addition to the drivers' personal policies, but the company did not respond to a request for more details on the amount and type of its policies.

While currently, the company only operates around San Francisco, McCarthy says he plans soon to move into southern California, then to Washington and Colorado.

But his grand vision involves a vast network of caregivers across the country who deliver marijuana to patients in all states where the drug is legal.

He added: 'Although the healing effects of marijuana have been researched and documented, the medicine is still subject to much controversy.

'It’s a shame that patients requiring marijuana for chronic illnesses are often stigmatized. At Eaze, we developed technology to make it easier and quicker for patients to receive their medicine through professional delivery experiences.'

Eaze, however, already faces stiff competition in this apparent emerging market and is not the only startup which offers such a service.

Just last week it was reported that two 19-year-old students at the University of Washington in Seattle launched a phone app to deliver cannabis to medical-marijuana users.

Josiah Tullis and Megh Vakharia also describe their business, called Canary, as ‘Uber for marijuana.’

The app allows medical-marijuana cardholders to select different strains of pot from different medical dispensaries and then have it delivered by a cardholding driver.

Another company, called Grassp, also offers a near-identical service in Los Angeles.

Marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I drug by the government, 
but pot entrepreneurship is growing. So is legalization of marijuana - 
currently 23 states and the District of Columbia allow medical pot use.
