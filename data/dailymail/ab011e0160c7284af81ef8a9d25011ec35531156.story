Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan have topped a list of the most generous American philanthropists in 2013.

The couple last year pledged a donation of 18 million shares of Facebook stock, valued at more than $970 million, to a Silicon Valley nonprofit organisation.

The list - compiled by the Chronicle of Philanthropy  - also included philanthropist and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg at number four, who 
made gifts totaling $452 million in 2013 to arts, education, 
environment, public health and other causes.

George Mitchell, a 
Galveston, Texas, man who made his fortune in energy and real estate was second on the list, who left $750million to charity when he died.

At No. 3 were Nike chairman Philip Knight and his wife, Penelope, of Portland, Oregon,
 who made a $500 million challenge grant to Oregon Health & Science 
University Foundation for cancer research. The Knight pledge requires 
the university match it within the next two years.

The top 50 contributors made donations last year totaling $7.7 billion, plus pledges of $2.9 billion.

The Chronicle's editor said the most significant fact from the list was the amount of money coming from living donors, which totaled about the same amount as the two previous years combined.

Sergey Brin and his wife Anne Wojcicki were ninth on the list, after gifting $219-million last year

Stacey Palmer said: 'It's a sure sign that the economy is getting better and people are getting a lot less cautious.'

Some of the nation's biggest givers do not appear on the 2013 list, not because they stopped being generous, but because their donations in 2013 were counted as pledges in previous years.

For example, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, gave their foundation slightly more than $181.3 million last year, but they were paying off a pledge of about $3.3 billion they made in 2004.

CNN-founder Ted Turner and Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett also made large gifts toward previous pledges.

It took gifts totalling at least $37.5 million to make the list this year.

Forty-two of the top 50 made gifts of $50 million or more.

Thirty made big gifts to colleges and universities, but Palmer noted most college gifts went to science and research this year, not to buildings, as in previous years.

Nineteen people or couples on the list have signed the Giving Pledge, started by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett in 2010.

More than 120 of the world's wealthiest individuals and families have pledged to give at least half their wealth to charity since the movement began.

Although most people on the list were prominent wealthy people who have given generously in the past, Palmer said a few were surprises, including Jack MacDonald, a Seattle lawyer, who gave $139 million to three nonprofits upon his death.
