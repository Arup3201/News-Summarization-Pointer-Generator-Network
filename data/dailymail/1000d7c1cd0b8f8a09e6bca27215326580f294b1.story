It was a job opportunity that sounded too good to be true – sailing on a yacht through Australia’s tropical islands in return for working as an on-board nanny, caring for the skipper’s young son.

And it was too good to be true, for skipper John Collins was a serial rapist who, when police finally caught up with him and he stood before a court in Brisbane today, was convicted of assaulting seven young women on board the yacht.

With his hair pulled back in a pony tail, the 74-year-old sailor was found guilty of 10 counts of rape and five of stupefying his victims in order to commit an offence. He will be sentenced early next month.

Serial rapist: John Collins, 74, lured young women with the prospect of a job aboard his yacht in Queensland

Although the nationalities of the young women who fell for his promises of a life of luxury and sunshine aboard his yacht, Pan Pacific, have not been revealed, Crown Prosecutor David Nardone told Brisbane District Court at an earlier hearing that Collins’ youngest victim was just 17.

Mr Nardone said Collins deliberately targeted young women by introducing himself as a prospective employer looking for a nanny to travel with him on his boat, caring for his young son.

Four of the women who fell for the lure, said Mr Nardon, were drugged by Collins before he took advantage of them.

The 17-year-old was initially offered a job in 1986 as a receptionist at a motel he owned in Queensland, but when she turned up to start her employment she was told he had been called to his yacht, moored nearby, and she should meet him there.

On board, they discussed terms and conditions of employment and Collins and his intended victim celebrated with a glass of champagne, although she took only ‘a couple of sips’, said the prosecutor.

But as they sat in the galley, he forced himself onto her and raped her. She was able to flee and drive away in her car.

Mr Nardone said the teenager did not tell anyone about the incident – until she saw a newspaper article describing a similar rape on a boat in 2000. She told police and she was able to identify Collins on a police photo board.

'Sophisticated tactics': Collins promised his victims a life of luxury on board his yacht, the Pan Pacific, in Queensland, Australia

The prosecutor said Collins’ tactics ‘grew more sophisticated’ as he went on to hire and then rape another six young women in ‘remarkably similar circumstances’.

Two of the women fell pregnant as a result of the rapes, said Mr Nardone.

Collins’ final victim was just 19 when she responded to a job advertisement placed by Collins. He picked her up and, after they stopped to buy drinks, they travelled to the yacht for dinner.

When it grew late the young woman asked to take a shower and go to bed and was told she could use the shower in the main cabin – where Collins slept – because none of the other showers were working.

When she came out of the shower Collins forced her onto the bed and raped her twice. Police were later able to use DNA technology to link Collins to the assault.

But by then he had fled from Queensland, leaving his yacht behind.

He was able to avoid police for six years, said Mr Nardone, before he was arrested in South Australia in 2006.

There were, the prosecutor told the jury, ‘remarkable similarities’ in all the women’s stories over the 14-year period Collins had offended and this was an indicator they were each telling the truth.

It took the jury a week to deliberate the case before returning to the court today to find Collins guilty of most of the total of 22 charges against him.

After the jury announced their decision, the aging Collins insisted he had been unfairly convicted.

‘I just can’t believe that,’ he told the court. ‘I am 100 per cent innocent and I’ve been found guilty of all of these crimes.’ He will be sentenced on April 3.
