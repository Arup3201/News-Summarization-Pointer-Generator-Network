Cricket's corruption crisis took a new twist on Monday when former New Zealand star Chris Cairns was alleged to be the man at the centre of the latest fixing scandal.

The 43-year-old former Notts all-rounder strongly denied reports that he had made illicit approaches to Lou Vincent and Brendon McCullum.

Cairns was last night named as the fixer by the authoritative New Zealand Herald but he told Fairfax Media: ‘Former cricketer Lou Vincent and current New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum have made a range of allegations against a cricketer dubbed Player X.

‘It is well known that the ICC/ACSU 
has been investigating allegations of corruption and my name has been 
linked by others to these  allegations. I am being asked whether I am 
Player X.

‘These allegations against me are a complete lie.’

As
 revealed exclusively on Friday by Ed Hawkins in Sportsmail, Vincent 
said he began fixing in 2008 on behalf of a world-famous former 
international.

On Monday this newspaper also revealed that McCullum said
 he was approached twice by a player he regarded as his ‘hero’.

Cairns
 said Vincent was ‘in a desperate position’ and insisted: ‘I have never 
approached Brendon, or  anyone else, about match- fixing or any other 
improper activity.’

Cairns,
 who sued former IPL chief Lalit Modi for £90,000 in 2012 after Modi 
tweeted about the Kiwi’s alleged involvement with fixing, went on: ‘I 
have been to court to demonstrate conclusively that I am not a 
match-fixer before.

'I will have no hesitation in doing so again. I 
believe there are dark forces at play. These forces have long arms, deep
 pockets and great influence.’

New
 Zealand Cricket chief executive David White said he knew the name of 
the player alleged to have approached Vincent and McCullum, but said: ‘I
 can’t confirm it as it could jeopardise further investigations.’

Cairns
 played 62 Tests for New Zealand between 1989 and 2004, scoring 3,320 
runs at an average of 33.5 and taking 218 wickets at 29.

A hard-hitting all-rounder, he held the world record for most sixes in Tests with 87, a mark since bettered by Adam Gilchrist.

Cairns
 played for Notts from 1989 to 1996, returning in 2003. But that did not
 prevent him embarrassing his Trent Bridge colleague Chris Read, whom he
 infamously bowled between his legs with a looping slower ball in the 
1999 Lord’s Test.
