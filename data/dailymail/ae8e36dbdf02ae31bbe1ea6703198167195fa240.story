Goals from Diego Costa and Kurt Zouma ensured Chelsea came back to beat Olimpija Ljubljana 2-1 after a first half scare.

Jose Mourinho's men found themselves behind going in to the break after Nik Kapun put the Slovenian side 1-0 up. But second half goals from Costa and Zouma put the Blues back in charge and Chelsea were comfortable from then on.

Branislav Ivanovic thought he had added a third but, after initially awarding it, the referee appeared to change his mind and the goal was chalked off.

Speaking after the game, Mourinho said: 'The important thing is to give competition to the players, the best thing was that Olimpija made it difficult. The other good thing is that we didn't pick up injuries.'

The Chelsea boss named a strong side after their mid-week draw with RZ Pellets and the club's new signings lived up to their billing as they combined to overturn a first half deficit.

The west London club had looked comfortable in the first half but some slack defending was punished when 20-year old midfielder Nik Kapun but the hosts in front with a powerful first-time shot.

The home side's lead lasted until half-time, but Fabregas and Costa combined to prove why the club paid so much money for them early in the second period.

The former Barcelona midfielder split Olimpija's defence with a pinpoint pass and Costa rifled the ball into the back of the net after bursting through on goal.

On his new forward's goal, Mourinho added: 'Obviously it's nice for a striker to score in his first game.

'Every
 team has got stronger, not just us. The English league is the only one 
where five teams are candidates. We feel we are going to be very strong 
and we want to fight for the title, no doubt about it.'

Less
 than 10 minutes after Costa's goal Chelsea were ahead. A Fabregas corner 
was met by Fernando Torres and although his effort was saved, the rebound was tucked away by Zouma from close-range.

No
 sooner had the game restarted than Ivanovic thought he had scored his 
side's third. But after much confusion the referee appeared to turn 
against his original decision and the goal was chalked off.

Torres could have added a gloss to proceedings but he squandered a glorious chance. Nathan Ake's cut back looked impossible to miss. Torres proved otherwise.

The victory was the first of Chelsea's European tour after they drew with RZ Pellets on Wednesday.
