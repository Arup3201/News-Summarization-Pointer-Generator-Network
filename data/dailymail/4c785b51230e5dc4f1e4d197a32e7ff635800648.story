A Chinese student has died after being found slumped over an electric fence after apparently trying to sneak out to meet her boyfriend.

The body of Jiao Chin was hanging over the fence at the campus of the Xishuangbanna Dai Prefecture in south-western China's Yunnan Province.

The grim discovery was made by fellow students at the university in the early hours of the morning, who found the 22-year-old only wearing a T-shirt and shorts.

Jiao Chin, who was found dead, slumped over an electric fence at her university accommodation after apparently trying to sneak out to meet her boyfriend 

The fence had been erected around the university accommodation after a string of intruders tried to break in.

Now her classmates believe that she might have been going to meet someone when she died.

Roommate Qing Wan, 23, said: 'I had no idea she had left the room until I looked out of the window and saw her body down below with people and police milling around it.

'I don't know where she was going as she didn't say anything to me, but I do know she was seeing someone so maybe she had gone to meet him?'

The university accommodation where the 22-year-old was living. Fellow students made the grim discovery of finding her body in the early hours of the morning 

A university spokesperson confirmed that the electric fence was installed to keep out intruders from the property 

Meanwhile a university spokesperson said: 'The electric fence was installed to keep intruders out after we had a few incidents of unauthorised people trying to get in.

'It was there for the students' safety and we never imagined one of them would try to climb over it.

'They all knew it was electric.'

Police said they are now looking into the death, and add they have not ruled out foul play.

A police spokesman said: 'It seems at this stage as if she was going to try and meet someone, but we need to explore all avenues before giving a definitive explanation for what happened.'
