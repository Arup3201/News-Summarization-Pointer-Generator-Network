Kinky posts: Desiree Henegar, 47, had been updating her sex blog during work hours as CFO for the Hernando schools district in Florida

A chief financial officer of a school district has been updating her sex blog during working hours, it was revealed today.

Desiree Henegar, 47, has been posting messages and pornographic images to photo-sharing site Tumblr under the name Floridagirl46 since last March.

Ms Henegar, who manages finance for the Hernando school district in Florida, allegedly updated her account up to eleven times during a working day with the sexually explicit material, including some images of herself. 

The CFO also used her account to 
criticize her 'big boss', believed to be superintendent Bryan Blavatt, 
describing his 'nasty cigar breath' and 'ugly' behavior. 

On July 31, she posted the graphic image of two women performing oral sex on a man, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

In one caption, she wrote: 'Having inappropriate thoughts during a Board
meeting.'

According to the Times, she posted a picture of a man exposing himself, writing 'instant turn-on' beneath it.

She also posted multiple images of masturbation and nudes.

Henegar confirmed to the Times that the account was hers. The Floridagirl46 account, which was set up in March, was deleted on Wednesday.

Calls to the Hernando schools' district office were not returned to MailOnline at the time of publication.

Henegar posted thousands of times to the account which she referred to as a 'sex blog'.

She seemed to be conscious that the content was inappropriate, writing: 'Since this is considered a sex blog and 
obviously NSFW (not safe for work), I must be extremely careful given my
professional life.'

Authorities found out about Henegar's blog following an anonymous tip.

Heather Martin, the district's executive
director of business services, has been investigating but is yet to make
any statement on the matter. School employees are restricted from certain activities online during work hours.

Henegar is in charge of the finance department for the Florida district which has 26 schools and 23,000 students.

Her $78,000-a-year job involves being responsible for the budget, grants and the payroll of employees.
