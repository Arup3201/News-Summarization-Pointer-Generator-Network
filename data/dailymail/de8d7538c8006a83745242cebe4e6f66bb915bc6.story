A 29-year-old man who allegedly walked into an Oregon elementary school and tried to kidnap a nine-year-old boy was stopped when the child's teachers realized what was going on and gave chase.

Joshua Brown walked through the the front doors of Joseph Gale Elementary School in Forest Grove on Thursday afternoon as hundreds of children were filing out for the day, police said.

He then reportedly strode into a classroom and picked up a third-grade boy, before attempting to walk out with him. However, two teachers, Sienna Garrett and Staci Heath, were in the room at the time.

Ms Heath, who was the first one to spot Brown, immediately demanded that he put the boy down while the child exclaimed loudly that he did not know the man who was holding him, school officials said.

Brown then allegedly panicked and dropped the boy  on the ground, before fleeing from the school. But within seconds,  the school's principal, Gretchen Schlag, and other staff members had given chase.

While Ms Heath and Ms Garrett apparently remained inside the school to ensure the nine-year-old boy and other students were safe, Ms Schlag and her colleagues followed Brown out of the gates.

They reportedly called 911 as they pursed Brown into the surrounding neighborhood. Minutes later, the suspect was arrested by police - although Ms Schlag said the chase 'felt like it lasted forever.'

Now, Brown is facing on multiple charges, including kidnapping and burglary, for his alleged actions at the school at 3130 18th Ave. He was already wanted on a felony warrant, OregonLive.com reported.

During the incident, Brown is believed to have been able to enter the school's one unlocked exterior door while around 350 students and dozens of staff members were departing after the final bell.

Although the young boy he picked up was naturally 'shy', he was 'very vocal' in alerting Ms Heath and Ms Garrett to the fact that he did not know the man who was holding him, Ms Schlag said.

'He did a very nice job of saying "I don't know this person. This is a stranger. I don't know who you are",' she told Fox 12, adding that Brown was only in the school for around one minute in total.

After Ms Heath ordered Brown to put the boy down, the suspect apparently told her the principal had asked him to evacuate the school. Ms Heath later told police Brown appeared high or drunk.

On Friday, parents were praising Ms Schalg, Ms Heath and Ms Garrett, as well as the other staff members involved in tracking down Brown, for their efforts in ensuring the boy's welfare.

'I'm just glad they caught him. It definitely could have been a whole lot worse,' said one, John Verand.

Police have not yet established a motive, nor a connection between Brown and Joseph Gale, KPTV reported. There is not thought to be a connection between the suspect and the unidentified child.

Ms Schlag said she will now be placing additional staff members near the school's main entrance in a bid to enhance students' safety. Staff patrolling the area will be given walkie-talkies, she said.

It is the first time the school has experienced an incident of this kind, Ms Schlag added.
