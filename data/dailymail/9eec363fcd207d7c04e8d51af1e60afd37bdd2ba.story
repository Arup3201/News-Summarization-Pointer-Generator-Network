Scientists have identified a new species of ancient porpoise with a chin length unprecedented among known mammals.

The unusual feature suggests that the animal used the tip of its face to probe the seabed for food.

Related to living crown porpoises, the extinct Semirostrum ceruttii had an extension of its jaw called a symphysis that measured 33in (85cm) in the best-preserved specimen, researchers said.

The typical symphysis of a crown porpoise measures just half to one inch-long (one to two cm).Porpoises and dolphins are closely related within a family that also includes beluga and narwhal. 

The species lived roughly 1.5 to 5.3 million years ago along at least 450 kilometers of the California coast.

Semirostrum ceruttii, had an extension 
of its jaw called a symphysis that 
measured 33in (85cm) in the best-preserved specimen.

The typical symphysis of a crown porpoise measures just half to one inch-long (one to two cm).

Scans reveal extensive nerve canals 
leading from the symphysis into the rear of the skull, indicating that 
the protuberance was highly sensitive and could relay meaningful 
information to the animal's brain.

The semirostrum was a benthic feeder - an animal that dug for food lodged in 
the seabed.

Modern porpoises seek food throughout 
the water column, preferring inshore, bottom-dwelling, and mid-water 
prey, including fish and cephalopods.

'This is unique anatomy for a mammal,' said Rachel Racicot, the Yale doctoral candidate who is lead author of the paper about the research, published in the journal Current Biology.

'And it tells us that porpoises once searched for food in a very different way than they do now.'

Ms Racicot and her colleagues 
analysed original fossils and CT scans of the best-preserved specimen, 
which she describes as 'almost completely preserved'. 

The
 scans reveal extensive nerve canals leading from the symphysis into the
 rear of the skull, indicating that the protuberance was highly 
sensitive and could relay meaningful information to the animal's brain.

The paper is the most thorough description ever of Semirostrum and the first to make the case that the porpoise was a benthic feeder, or an animal that dug for food lodged in the seabed. 

Modern porpoises seek food throughout the sea, preferring inshore, bottom-dwelling, and mid-water prey, including fish and octopuses.

Semirostrum is known from about 15 fossil specimens, all from California, including a remarkably well-preserved holotype specimen found at a construction site in San Diego. 

The species lived roughly 1.5 to 5.3 million years ago along at least 280 miles (450km) of the California coast.

The name Semirostrum ceruttii refers to the animal's unusual jaw — the rostrum is the lower half of the jaw. 

The closest jaw structure in living animals is found in birds known as skimmers and in half-beak fish.

As Black Skimmers hunt for food, they fly just above the surface of water bodies with their symphysis slightly submerged to probe and scoop small fish and crustaceans.

Both skimmers and half-beak fish feed mainly at night, suggesting the importance to them of highly sensitive probes that can relay through touch information about unseen prey.
