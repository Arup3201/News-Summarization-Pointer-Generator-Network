Irish artist Duncan Campbell has been named winner of this year’s Turner Prize for a video that tackles African art and colonialism.

Mr Campell’s video, ‘It for Others’, was inspired by a 1953 documentary about African art, featuring a dance sequence created with choreographer Michael Clark.

However his £25,000 win comes following criticism this year’s nominees have turned the event into one that is ‘sober, respectful, polite, middle aged’ and lacks the fun and excitement of previous entries.

Speaking to the Today programme yesterday, the BBC’s Arts Editor Will Gompertz said: ‘I think actually it’s quite a weak year. I have to say I don’t think it’s a classic year.’

He said this year’s shortlist of three videos and one instillation featuring different prints, was tame comparied to the controversey stoked by artists such as Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst.

He said: ‘The Turner Prize has been going for 30 years and it’s well beyond it’s rebellious, anti-establishment, attention-seeking attitude of its teenage years – the Damien Hirsts and the formaldehyde cows and Tracey Emin’s bed and Martin Creed’s lights going on and off.

‘All that fun and games has gone, and it’s a much more sober, respectful, polite, middle aged prize. And it is full of introspection and frankly it isn’t quite as exciting.’

Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50, living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months.

In 1999 Emin won the prize for My Bed, which featured stained sheets surrounded by cigarette butts and condoms.

Four years earlier Hirst’s winning entry included a cow and a calf cut in half and preserved in formaldehyde.

Winners have also included Grayson Perry’s pots tackling subjects like death and child abuse, and Martin Creed’s work featuring a light going on and off

Mr Campbell was presented with his award by 12 Years a Slave actor Chiwetel Ejiofor at a ceremony at the Tate Britain in London last night.

Accepting his prize, Mr Campbell dedicated his win to his family including his parents and son.

The artist joked: ‘A friend of mine was reminding me recently about the poet W B Yeats, who, when a journalist phoned him to tell him about to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, the first question he asked was “how much?”.

'I already know how much. This money will make a huge difference to me.’

Other artists to be shortlisted for this year’s prize included James Richards for his video featuring censored, erotic images from a book found in a Tokyo library.

The Turner Prize 2014 exhibition runs to January 4 at Tate Britain in central London. Work by the nominees has been on show at the gallery since late September.

Duncan Campbell, 41, was born in Dublin, and studied at the University of Ulster, Belfast.

The film-artist now lives in Glasgow, where he graduated from the Glasgow School of Art as a Master of Fine Art.

Campbell is the fourth graduate from the university to have won the Turner Prize in the last 10 years.

Accepting the prize, Campbell paid tribute to his family, including his parents Paddy and Veronica, who watched the ceremony. He also spoke of his son, who was not able to be there.
