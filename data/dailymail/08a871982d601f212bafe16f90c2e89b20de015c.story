A farmer and one of his workers have been found shot dead in an isolated farmhouse in Northern Ireland.

The men were discovered at the secluded property around a mile from the quiet Co Antrim village of Glenarm early this evening.

They have been named locally as farm owner Arthur Gibson, in his early 60s, and farm labourer Michael Murphy, in his late 30s.

At this stage it is understood police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the double shooting.

Mr Murphy had worked for Mr Gibson for many years.

Forensic teams in white overalls were examining the scene, paying particular attention to the hallway of the two-storey white painted house.

At police cordons at the foot of the long lane leading up to the Feystown Road dairy farm a small crowd gathered as news of the sudden deaths filtered through to the village.

A Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) spokesman said: 'Police received a report at around 5.15pm this afternoon that two males had been discovered at a property with fatal wounds. An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deaths is under way.'

Local Stormont Assembly member Oliver McMullan knew both the dead men.

The Sinn Fein representative said the community was stunned by what he described as a 'double tragedy'.

'The death tonight of two men is a tragedy not only for the families but also for the community,' he said.

'The community is in a state of shock as both men were well known within this tight knit community.

'My thoughts and prayers are with the families at this time.'

Mr McMullan paid tribute to the response of the emergency services and hailed the neighbouring farmers who had stepped in to keep the farm running.

SDLP councillor Martin Wilson said: 'The entire community will be united in their sense of grief at this shocking and disturbing occurrence.

'Both men were well-known and their untimely deaths will be met with disbelief by those living in the community.

'All our thoughts and prayers are surely with the families at this very difficult time.'

Alliance party MLA Stewart Dickson said: 'This is an absolutely shocking incident, which has left the village and the surrounding community in shock.

'My thoughts are with the families and friends of the deceased and would call for anyone with any information to contact the PSNI as soon as possible.

'I hope the police will be able to determine what was behind this tragic incident tonight.'

Glenarm came to wider public attention 
earlier this year when severe late winter blizzards enveloped farms in 
the surrounding hills in a thick blanket of snow, killing thousands of 
live stock and cutting off many families for days.
