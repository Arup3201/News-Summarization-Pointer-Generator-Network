Fashion chain Republic is expected to become the latest high street store to call in administrators today - putting 1,000 jobs at risk.

The group, which has 120 stores across the UK is reported to have already lined up accounting firm Ernst & Young to handle the administration.

Republic would be the fourth big name retailer to have hit serious financial trouble already this year, with thousands of jobs lost as music giant HMV, camera equipment specialist Jessops and DVD and games rental group Blockbuster all called in administrators last month.

Republic, owed by private equity firm TPG, has a target market of 16 to 25 year olds.

It sells a range of brands including Bench, American Apparel and Henleys.

It is understood that the chain has suffered in recent months thanks partly to its large presence in the north of England, in areas that have been hit particularly badly by the recession.

The company's chairman, Andy Bond, is said to have stood down last week.

Mr Bond, a former Asda boss, had been with the chain for less than two years.

The chain was snapped up by TPG for £300million in June 2010 from previous majority shareholders Change Capital who acquired the group for £105million in 2005.

Private equity house TPG previously part owned Debenhams, but its purchase of Republic represented its first foray into European retail for several years.

It was reported in October 2011 that the firm were looking to inject funds into the Republic group in a bid to acquire new stores and improve the chain's online presence.

Former TK Maxx boss Paul Sweetenham was recently hired as chief executive.

The store was founded in 1986 in Leeds, West Yorkshire, as Best Company, a store specialising in denim and mens' jeans.

But its owners gradually transformed it into a staple of high street fashion for trendy teenagers and early twenty-somethings.

The Republic brand was launched in 1998 and by 2011 the business was turning over £27.3million profit pre-tax.

It had stepped up its expansion in 2005 and was said to be opening between five and ten stores a year.

Both Ernst & Young and Republic declined to comment yesterday.

Republic's expected collapse into administration makes it the latest in a long line of high-profile high street firms to fail - the most visible legacy of the financial crisis and subsequent double-dip recession.
