A multimillionaire football boss has been accused of racism after reportedly saying that every Englishman has at some time called a ‘Chinaman a chink’.

Wigan Athletic owner Dave Whelan, 77, also allegedly told the Guardian that ‘Jewish people chase money more than everybody else’.

The former owner of JJB Sports – who is thought to be worth around £200million – is reported to have made the remarks as he defended his appointment of Malky Mackay as the new manager of the club.

Ex-Cardiff City manager Mackay is under investigation by the Football Association after supposedly exchanging offensive messages with the club’s ex-head of recruitment Iain Moody.

The texts included one where Mackay described Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan, as a ‘chink’. 

In another, he referred to Jewish agent Phil Smith, saying: ‘Nothing like a Jew that sees money slipping through his fingers.’

And in a third, Mackay said there were ‘enough dogs in Cardiff to go round’ after he signed South Korean international Kim Bo-kyung.

Defending the manager’s appointment, Mr Whelan said he did not regard Mackay’s comments as offensive.

He reportedly said he used the word ‘chink’ when he was young, adding: ‘If any Englishman said he has never called a Chinaman a chink he is lying.’  

He is also reported to have said: ‘I think Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else. I don’t think that’s offensive at all.’ 

Today, Mr Whelan (left next to Malkay Mackay), the former owner of the JJB Sports chain, claimed the scandal surrounding the texts and emails was a 'mountain out of a molehill' 

Mr Whelan's decision to hand Mackay a return to football has been widely criticised

Mr Whelan claimed he did not think there was ‘a lot wrong’ with what Mackay said, adding: ‘I did ask Malky questions about the problems he’s had on the racist thing. He admits what he did and apologised for what he said. I accept that totally. I think Malky has been so unlucky. He has done a little bit wrong and has apologised for it. It’s not like we are all saints.’

Former FA executive Simon Johnson, who is now chief executive at the Jewish Leadership Council, insisted: ‘Mackay used offensive language to insult a fellow participant in football using a tawdry racial stereotype.’

And yesterday two of the team’s sponsors ended their arrangement with the club, with kitchen appliances firm Premier Range describing its position as ‘untenable’. But a spokesman for Mr Whelan said: ‘The quotes were taken out of context and twisted.’ Mr Whelan later apologised for his remarks.

On the Chinese

If any Englishman said he has never called a Chinaman a chink he is lying. There is nothing bad about doing that. It is like calling the British Brits, or the Irish paddies.

On the Jews 

The Jews don’t like losing money. Nobody likes losing money.

Do you think Jewish people chase money a little bit more than we do? I think they are very shrewd people.

I think Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else. I don’t think that’s offensive at all.

It’s telling the truth. Jewish people love money, English people love money; we all love money.
