The winner of the $337 million Powerball said today he is a self professed 'hillbilly' and admitted that his first purchase after learning of his good fortune was a pack of gum.

Speaking from Lansing at the Michigan Lottery headquarters as he was presented with his check, Donald Lawson, 44, revealed that he had told his family to all take early retirement and that he was preparing to leave his crime-infested neighbourhood of Lapeer.

Despite his enormous win, the married railroad worker who has two daughters still found time to have a pop at the government for taking $112 million in tax from him - 'I'm kinda pissed at Uncle Sam,' he quipped at his first media appearance since his August 16th win.

Lawson said the first thing he bought after winning the third-largest Powerball jackpot ever was a pack of bubble gum.

And the 'hillbilly' who grew up in Fort Smith, Arkansas said it wasn't long before he 
quit his job as a railroad engineer.

Standing alongside 
three family members, an ecstatic Lawson described the moment he learned his life 
was about to change, when he checked the ticket he bought at a local Lapeer
Sunoco gas station for the August 15th lottery draw.

'I started reading backwards, and lost my breath,' said Lawson. The winning numbers were 6, 27, 46, 51, 56 and Powerball 21.

Lawson,
who has two daughters, opted to take a lump-sum payment of $224.6 
million because the winning amount of $337 million was subjected to state and federal taxes.

He said he doesn't know yet what he'll do with the money, but 
he plans to travel and continue living a 'simple life.'

As he approached the podium to be presented with his giant ceremonial lottery check, Lawson joked, pointed and told the lottery commissioner, 'My name goes here.'

He asked if the amount was going to be tax free and Michigan Commissioner Scott Bowen laughed and replied, 'I'm afraid not, brother.'

Opting to pay the $112 odd in tax on his $337 million win, Lawson said that he has told his entire family to take early retirement and that he was going to provide for them.

'Everybody that's related to me, as far as my whole immediate family, was told to retire and they had no problem with that,' said Lawson to ABC News

Speaking about his win, Lawson said that he usually purchases the Quick Pick tickets but when he got involved in a line, he decided to hand-pick his numbers.

'I didn't really pick them, my hand just went,' said Lawson. 'I don't know how the numbers came about.'

The father of two credits his win to 'something from above.'

'I sat there, said a prayer and calmed myself down a little bit,' said Lawson about the moment he knew his life had changed forever.

He then sat down called his sister and told her to come home and then called his mother.

'I've got a surprise for you. I won $200,000 in the Powerball,' said Lawson to his mother after he had hidden the ticket in his bible on top of his fridge.

But when his mother began to congratulate him on a much smaller win he burst out with the truth and his mother at first didn't believe him.

'We come from poor people so he knows the value of a dollar all his life,' said Lawson's mother.

'I don't think it'll change him...He's a jokester. It's not going to change.'

When asked what he is planning to do with his money now that he is a multi millionaire, Lawson said travel and a new home were his top priorities.

'I wanted to travel a lot and now I can,' said Lawson.

'I can go anywhere in the world I want and that's what I'm going to do.

But his feet are still going to remain grounded swears Lawson.

'I'm a millionaire now, but I like McDonalds,' he said.

The lottery winner said he said a small prayer when he won the lottery and has told his entire family to retire

'I'm
going to escape for now, and go somewhere safe,' he said, adding that 
he plans to move from Lapeer, a city about 45 miles north of Detroit 
where he's lived for the past decade.

Lawson 
said the jackpot winnings won't last long if he isn't careful, joking 
about the government immediately claiming its share.

'I'm kinda pissed at Uncle Sam,' he quipped.

The gas station that sold the winning ticket will get a $50,000 bonus, Michigan Lottery officials said.
