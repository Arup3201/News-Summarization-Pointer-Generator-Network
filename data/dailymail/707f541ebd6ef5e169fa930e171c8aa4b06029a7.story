England fans taunted their Scottish rivals with a series of chants poking fun at the result of the country's historic referendum, including one song informing them: 'You're British 'til you die'.

The 5,000 English supporters who headed to Glasgow for the 3-1 England victory also lampooned outgoing First Minister Alex Salmond, who was in the stands and quit after losing the Yes Campaign, singing to him: 'We all voted yes'.

For long periods they also belted out Rule Britannia and God Save The Queen over and over again as the Auld Enemy comfortably beat bitter rivals Scotland 3-1 at Parkhead in Glasgow.

In the weeks before September's independence vote the outcome was on a knife-edge but in the end the No side won a decisive victory, with 55 per cent of the votes - and 85 per cent of the country voted.

But the banter in the stands turned sour when a significant number of England fans also sang anti-IRA songs while the official Football Association band played the song 'Follow England Away', and an FA official was then sent to the stands to tell the band to  stop playing.

Other supporters unfurled a 'No Surrender' flag - a phrase used in a well known song sometime heard at England games where some chant: 'No surrender, no surrender, no surrender to the IRA scum'.

The singing will worry FA bosses, with England due to play a friendly with the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in June.

The match was being played in Scotland for the first time in 15 years but two goals from captain Wayne Rooney and a header by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was enough to beat Gordon Strachan's side.  

Up to 60,000  fans watched the friendly - the oldest fixture in international football.

There was a heightened police presence around the stadium, stations and city centre but there were no reports of major fighting between rival fans before, during or after the game, which has been marred by violence in the past.

The match itself passed without incident although seven people were arrested following a disturbance near a city centre   

Police were called to the scene near the Thistle Hotel in Cambridge Street, Glasgow, at around 10.20pm.

Supporters from both sides were arrested in connection with alleged breach of the peace offences.

They are expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today.

During the match, tensions ran high amid reports of anti-IRA chanting by some fans.

Each side booed the respective singing of their national anthems and England supporters were heard singing “f*** the IRA” during the match.

Celtic Park was close to its 60,000 capacity for the much-anticipated game as the neighbours met on Scottish turf for the first time in 15 years.

Upset: But other Three Lions fans started chanting 'f*** the IRA' - which led to an apology from the Football Association 

Message: Other fans unfurled a 'No Surrender' banner - a phrase used in the song: 'No surrender to the IRA'

Police Scotland said they had not received any reports of offensive chants following the 3-1 victory to England.

But in the first half, an FA official contacted the band to ask them to stop playing the tune for the chant.

After the game England manager Roy Hodgson said he was unaware of the song but apologised for any offence on behalf of the FA.

He said: “I was aware the crowd were tremendously supportive. I didn’t have a clue what they were chanting.

“I don’t condone it. If anyone was offended, I’m sure the FA would like to apologise to them.

“All we can do is play our football and be grateful for the support and hopefully they will behave themselves and not get themselves into a situation where their chanting is being criticised.”

The England team take part in a minute's applause in memory of Scotland fan Nathan McSeveney, who died on Friday

More than 200 people were arrested in 1999 when England took on Scotland at Hampden Park and police said ahead of the match that they were monitoring “known troublemakers” from both countries who they believed were planning to attend.

Around 5,000 visiting fans celebrated after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave England the lead in the first half and Wayne Rooney went on to score twice.

A goal from Scotland’s Andrew Robertson was not enough for Scotland to repeat their victory over the Republic of Ireland at Parkhead on Friday.

Before the 8pm kick-off there was a minute’s applause for Scotland supporter Nathan McSeveney, who died at the match.

Supporters had mixed views on whether Scotland v England - the oldest fixture in international football - should resume as an annual event.

Tartan Army member David McCann said: “You can see from the build-up that it gets everyone interested and it makes a change from the usual boring friendly matches.

“But if it was played every year, then I think they’d need to lower the ticket prices.”

England supporter James Ward said: “I’m looking forward to it but I don’t think it should be (played) every year. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, and all that.”
