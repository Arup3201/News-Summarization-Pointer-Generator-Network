An island paradise in the Caribbean has gone on sale – for the price of a one-bedroom flat in London.

The six-acre island, pictured, can be snapped up for just £360,000. For the same price, buyers could go for an ex-council flat in the capital.

The 'Bonefish' cay in the Bahamas is currently unoccupied, but an area has been landscaped in preparation for a luxury house.

The small Bonefish cay is on the market for just £360,000 - less than the cost of a one-bedroom flat in London

Getting there could be a stumbling block for many potential buyers: visitors must first take a ten-hour flight to the city of Nassau, before boarding a ferry for a one-hour ride.

For £360,000 an estate agent is selling a one bedroom flat off Old Street, East London and another is selling a one bedroom flat in Homerton, East London.

Also for sale is Buttonwood Cay, a 12.4 acre island just off the one of the main island of Mangrove Cay, which boasts a mile-long beach. It’s on the market for £895,000.

Another island paradise, 13-acre Finlay Cay, costs £1 million and is nestled in the middle of the Bahamas’ turquoise Atlantic Ocean.

The untouched island features sandy beaches, subtropical foliage and quiet shallows.
