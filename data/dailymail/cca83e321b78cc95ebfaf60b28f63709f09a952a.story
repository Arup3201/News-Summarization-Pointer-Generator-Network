Daniel Sturridge gave Liverpool fans a boost as he took to social media to reveal he was on his way back to England following specialist rehabilitation in the United States.

Sturridge posted a picture of himself on his official Instagram account with the lyrics to Kanye West and Chris Martin's track 'Homecoming'.

The Liverpool ace also stated the obvious, England is cold in January! But the striker will soon be able to warm up properly as he edges closer to a return to full training.

Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge reveals to fans that he is on his way back to Liverpool to continue his recovery

England international Sturridge has been sidelined since September with a long list of thigh and calf problems, but hopes to join his fellow team mates in full training this month

The striker has only played three games for Liverpool this season and hasn't featured since England's 1-0 win over Norway in September.

However, manager Brendan Rodgers is hopeful that Sturridge will be fit to face former employers Chelsea in the League Cup later this month.

Rodgers will have his fingers crossed that the return of his star striker will help his stuttering side find form after a dismal first half of the season.

In his absence,and with summer signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert struggling to hit form, Liverpool have lacked a cutting edge in front of goal; and find themselves eighth in the Premier League table, seven points adrift of the top four.

Sturridge shouldn't have too many problems winning his place back from Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert
