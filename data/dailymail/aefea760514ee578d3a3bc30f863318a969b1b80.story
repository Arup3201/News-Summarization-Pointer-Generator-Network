And now it gets interesting. As predicted, Jurgen Klopp appears to have tired of working to provide players for Bayern Munich and is looking for a way out of Borussia Dortmund.

An agent claiming to be his representative has been in contact with leading clubs and asked about a future in the Premier League.

Klopp said: ‘I think it’s the only country where I should work, because it’s the only country I know the language a little bit and I need the language for my work. If somebody will call me, then we will talk about it.’

Fairly unequivocal, then. So where do Arsenal go from here? Delay and they may lose Klopp forever. 

He would certainly be on Manchester City’s radar if Manuel Pellegrini does not turn this season around and has a habit of committing to a project for a long time. Klopp has worked since 2008 at Dortmund and before that at Mainz from 2001.

Providing he is successful, he is exactly the sort of person capable of driving City’s development long-term, with the Etihad Campus complex scheduled to open early next month.

Klopp has a strong personality, capable of putting the club on the map in a way mild-mannered Pellegrini cannot.

This is now a huge call for Arsenal, the club seen as Klopp’s spiritual home in England. Do they let the opportunity pass as an unfortunate case of bad timing, or pick up the telephone?

Do that and they must be prepared to think the unthinkable on Arsene Wenger — although the longer they remain mid-table the more thinkable the unthinkable becomes.

‘It’s what’s called a dilemma, boy,’ wrote Joe Orton in Entertaining Mr Sloane. ‘You are on the horns of it.’
