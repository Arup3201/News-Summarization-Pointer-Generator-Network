It is definitely smarter that the average computer - and it set to bring a new level of intelligence to everything from dresses to drones.

Intel has unveiled a new smart camera system that can sense depth - and it could revolutionise the way we interact with machines.

The chip giant showed off a tablet that can use hand gestures to scroll a recipe, drones  that can manoeuvre an obstacle course without human intervention and even smart clothing that can help the visually impaired navigate safely - and a smart cocktail dress that can repel people who invade the wearer's space.

 During its keynote, Intel also unveiled a tiny wearable computer, called Curie, that is the size of a small button.

While the Curie hardware is based on Intel's first purpose-built system-on-chip (SoC) for wearable devices and is expected to ship to manufacturing partners in the second half of this year.

Packed into the tiny computer is Bluetooth, sensors and battery charging capabilities.

It will help firms make smaller smartwatches and other wearables. 

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich also used the keynote to show off the company's RealSense technology for seeing and understanding depth.

'The rise of new personal computing experiences, intelligent and connected devices, and the wearable revolution are redefining the relationship between consumers and technology,' he said. 

During his keynote at the annual CES show in Las Vegas, he also called for tech firms to hire a more diverse workforce.

'Our goal with Intel technology is to help solve real problems and enable experiences that are truly desired by people and businesses. 

'In order to do this, we must also do more to lead the growth of diversity and inclusion within the technology industry. 

'Women and under-represented minorities will continue to play a greater role as consumers, influencers, creators and leaders.' 

Intel also showedoff experimental designer Anouk Wipprecht's latest Spider Dress. 

'Fashion and tech are merging at the moment, beyond blinking dresses or cute skirts, she said. 

'I'm showing how fashion can be thought provoking, something that pushes people to think and share their feelings.

'Spider Dress acts as the interface between the body and the external world,' said Wipprecht. 

'It uses technology and the garment as a medium of interaction.'

The so-called animatronic arachnid limbs on the Spider Dress know exactly when someone is invading the wearer's personal space. 

The legs are driven by computer and sensor technologies that allow it to be autonomous, but assistive and adaptive to the owner's emotions and desires.

'Since the system based with mechanic spider legs is literally hosted on the shoulders of the wearer and attacks using the same viewing angle as the wearer, the system knows how you feel and adapts to those feelings,' she said.

Using wireless biometric signals, the system makes inferences based on the stress levels in your body. It can differentiate between 12 states of behavior. 

Wipprecht calls it an interesting interplay between co-control and education of your own body and mind.

'When approached at an aggressive pace, the system answers in a territorial attack mode,' she said. 

'But when you walk up to the dress in a more cautious, friendly symbiotic way, you can almost get the dress to invite you closer, as if to 'dance' with you.'

 CEO Brian Krzanich also used a keynote Tuesday to show off the company's RealSense technology for seeing and understanding depth, showing off:

•Food Network with Intel RealSense 3D Camera: Intel and Food Network have collaborated to create a cooking application that uses Intel RealSense technology to eliminate the need to touch the device and instead use gesture control and voice commands on an Intel RealSense 3D camera enabled device for easy scrolling through the application and navigation of recipes in real time. This will be available in the Spring of 2015.

•All-in-one PC with 3D Display Concept: Intel showcased a futuristic '3D I/O' technology that integrates Intel RealSense technology with a specialized glass screen to enable an immersive, hologram-like experience without the need for additional eyewear.

•Intel RealSense technology and wearables: Looking into the future, Krzanich also demonstrated a wearable technology research project that can help vision-impaired people navigate their environments more easily and safely. 

The wearable solution places sensors on clothing, equipped with Intel RealSense 3D cameras that sense the vicinity and trigger vibrations as a feedback mechanism, helping people to navigate their environment.

•Intel RealSense technology inside Robotics and Multi-copter drone: Intel demonstrated an iRobot® AVA® 500 video collaboration robot equipped with Intel RealSense cameras to support the platform's autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance technologies. In addition, Intel highlighted the growing possibilities for multi-copter drones, including the inspection of fields and power lines, delivering goods, and even monitoring endangered species. 

As these drones become smarter, they can see, react, and even move safely through the environment. 

During the CES keynote, Intel created a make-shift obstacle course inside the CES keynote ballroom and demonstrated a number of AscTec* Firefly multi-copter drones equipped with Intel RealSense cameras that provide 360-degree sensing and enabled with unique collision avoidance capabilities. 

Intel's RealSense camera module, which weighs as little as 8 grams and is less than 4mm thick, brings depth perception to drones both indoors and outdoors with minimal impact to payload and flight times.

 

Intel hopes to put the realsense system into laptops and tablets.

The Intel RealSense technology of software and depth cameras enables more natural and intuitive interaction with personal computing devices, the firm says. 

Cutting-edge facial detection and tracking, emotion detection, 3D scanning, depth-sensing photography, background removal, and the tracking of 22 joints in each hand for accurate touch-free gesture recognition are some of the new capabilities made possible with Intel RealSense technology.

It is hoped the Nixie will go on sale later this year.

Krzanich also highlighted Nixie, the 2014 'Make it Wearable' challenge winner and the first wearable camera that can fly.

Krzanich welcomed Nixie founders Christoph Kohstall and Jelena Jovanovic to the stage to discuss the Intel 'Make it Wearable' challenge and highlighted the opportunity it offers to innovators and entrepreneurs. 

Krzanich and the founders also posed for the first Nixie flying photo. Krzanich went on to say that Intel will sponsor the Intel 'Make it Wearable' challenge again later this year.
