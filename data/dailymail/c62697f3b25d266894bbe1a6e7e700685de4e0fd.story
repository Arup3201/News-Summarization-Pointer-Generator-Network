A former high school librarian and a prison chief were arrested today for plotting to kidnap, cook and then eat women and children.

The two arrests on Monday morning stemmed from an investigation into 'cannibal cop' Gilberto Vale who was convicted on similar charges last month.

Robert 'Chris' Asch, 61, is the former male librarian from New York's prestigious Stuyvesant High School who was arrested by the FBI in his Greenwich Village apartment Monday morning.

In a profile on the site imagefap, Asch shared his sick fantasies of torturing and raping a woman, and hoped to do so with a group of like-minded men.

His alleged co-conspirator Richard Meltz, a 65-year-old who was the chief of police at a veterans hospital in Massachusetts, was also arrested on Sunday in Rockaway, New Jersey.

The New York Times reports that Asch and Meltz were charged with kidnapping conspiracy.

The FBI has not explained how Asch and Meltz are connected to Vale, but The New York Post reports that an undercover officer was used in investigating their plot.

NBC New York reports that the FBI came into contact with Asch when he responded to an online ad where someone had posted that they wanted help kidnapping, raping and kill his wife, sister-in-law and the sister-in-law's children.

The ad was posted in October and Asch met with undercover FBI agents to discuss a similar plot in recent months.

At two of the meetings, he brought items that he reportedly thought would be useful including a taser, a black ski mask, handcuffs, a hammer, pliers and forceps.

The agents set it up so that Asch conducted surveillance on a woman- not knowing that she was also a member of the undercover operation.

During one conversation with another meeting with agents, Asch reportedly said the female target 'had to die'.

Asch was the one who brought Meltz into the operation, saying that he wanted to help with the kidnapping of the woman.

'This is a fairly high-risk operation,' Asch said in a recorded conversation with Meltz.

'Trying to snatch somebody off the street, home invasion, I think they're pretty high-risk.

'I mean, there are ways to dismember and dispose.'

Few details about their plot have been revealed, but some of their intended victims were said to be infants.

This is not the first time that Asch, who is openly gay, has been arrested.Â 

Asch's relationship with children has 
previously come into question when he was arrested and suspended from 
his job at Stuyvesant in 2009.

His dismissal came after he allegedly touched four male students at the high school and whispering in one of their ears. The charges were dropped.

FBI agents were seen searching Asch's apartment at the St Germain building on Greenwich Avenue shortly after his arrest around 11am.

A neighbor in his building said that other residents include a number of actors, some of whom have played serial killers in their careers.
