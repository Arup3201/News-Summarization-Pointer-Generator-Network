Former pupils at one of the country’s leading prep schools have come forward to say they were physically and sexually abused by at least two teachers, writes Paul Cahalan.

Ashdown House, in East Sussex, boasts such prominent alumni as Boris Johnson and Homeland actor Damian Lewis.

It is understood neither Johnson nor Lewis is among those claiming they were abused, but both attended the school between 1970 and 1980, the period in which the abuse is alleged to have occurred.

One alleged victim, speaking on condition of anonymity,  said: ‘One of the teachers abused and beat pupils, it was extremely violent. But my story is nothing compared to those of some of the others.’

The Mail on Sunday understands that police are  not yet investigating and details of the allegations have not yet been released.

But a lawyer acting for the former pupils said that the alleged abuse was ‘serious and widespread’.

A spokesman for Ashdown House, which today teaches about 140 boys and girls aged five to 13, said last night the school had not been made aware of the claims.

The news comes after revelations of abuse at some  of the country’s top private schools, including Caldicott Prep School in Buckinghamshire, attended by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

There have also been allegations of abuse at the Choristers School in Durham and the Yehudi Menuhin  School in Surrey.

Last week, Mr Clegg said he was ‘shocked and appalled’ to hear the former head teacher of Caldicott had been convicted of historic child sex offences.

Roland Peter Wright, 83,  head teacher between 1959 and 1970, was convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault against five pupils aged eight to 13.

It is understood the former pupils at Ashdown, which charges £7,990 per term for borders, want to sue the school and the members of staff in question, as well as pressing criminal charges.

Liz Dux, of legal firm Slater and Gordon, said: ‘We are in the very early stages of a highly complex and sensitive case.’
