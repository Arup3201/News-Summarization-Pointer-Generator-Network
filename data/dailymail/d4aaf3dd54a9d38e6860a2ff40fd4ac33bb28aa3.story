Two humpback whales have washed up on beaches in New South Wales in the last week.

The first animal appeared between Saltwater beach and Diamond Beach, Northern Sydney, on Sunday morning. The juvenile animal was found washed up on the shore. 

The second animal appeared the following morning, when a larger male humpback was spotted on the rocks at Wallabi Point, on the mid north coast of Sydney.

The giant mammal was said too large to be buried locally, and was thus and transported another location

Investigations are currently under way to determine what killed the giant mammals: It is believed that a ship collision could be responsible, as well as heavy sea conditions

Rob Harcourt, a professor at Macquarie University, told Sydney Morning Herald 'I wouldn't swim next to a dead whale. It's a shark magnet.'

Investigations are currently under way to determine what killed the giant mammals. It is believed that a ship collision could be responsible, as well as recent heavy seas.

The burial of washed up whales can prove  challenging for local authorities. The whale at Saltwater beach was buried in the sand, while the animal on Wallabi point was determined to be  too large to for a local burial, needing to be dissected and transported to another location.

Larger whales can weigh up to 60 tonnes, posing a serious challenge to authorities hoping to dispose of their bodies

Geoffrey Ross, a wildlife management officer with the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, says that 8-10 stranded whales will appear on beaches in New South Wales in an average year

Geoffrey Ross, a wildlife management officer with the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, says that 8-10 stranded whales will appear on beaches in New South Wales in an average year.

Mr Ross said the procedure to deal with whale bodies has changed in recent years, with wildlife authorities no longer taking them out to sea any more. Burying the animals on the beach is only viable with smaller whales.

Larger humpback whales can weigh up to 60 tonnes, posing a serious challenge to authorities looking to bury the animals.
