A New Jersey paint plant worker has died after he was overcome by fumes and fell on a vat of solvent.

Henry Campbell, 56, of Newark was checking the levels within the vat at Hartin Paint & Filler Corporation in Carlstadt on Wednesday while the plant was closed for the day.

But while carrying out the standard procedure he lost consciousness and toppled on top of the container, police say. His body was found covering the opening of the vat at around 3:58 p.m.

It's not clear why he lost consciousness, Detective John Cleary said.

He was taken, unresponsive, to Hackensack University Medical Center and died Wednesday night.

A co-worker at the plant, Kalifi Thomas, tried to save Campbell and managed to pull him off the vat but couldn't revive him.

Thomas of Elizabeth was treated and released.

Dennis Monks, Carlstadtâ€™s emergency services chief, told NJ.com that the vat contained the chemical toluene and was capable of holding at least 500 gallons.

The accident occurred in a tank located behind a two-story, concrete manufacturing building, witnesses told the website.

Monks said firefighters hosed down the two men to decontaminate them and emergency medical workers administered first aid.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration arrived on the scene around 5 p.m. and is investigating the incident. The Bergen County Hazmat Team were also called.

According to the news website, Hartin Paint was cited in 2007 for serious violations involving flammable liquids and the storage of materials that created a hazard and a number of 'less than serious' violations involving flammable liquids and respirators, which are used to protect workers.

The company was initially fined $3,000, but eventually entered into a settlement that allowed it to pay $1,350.

Hartin Paint has failed to comment on the death.
