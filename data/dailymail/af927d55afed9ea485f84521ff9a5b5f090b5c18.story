Chanel has cast a six-year-old in its brand-new cruise campaign.

Hudson Kroenig, who is the godson of Karl Lagerfeld, appears alongside model Joan Smalls, lending a playful touch to the images.

The photogenic tyke sports a few different looks, including a safari suit and cuffed jeans, while Miss Smalls wears bold prints from Chanel's resort collection in the images, shot by Mr Lagerfeld.

Hudson is a longtime muse for Mr Lagerfeld, having walked in multiple Chanel shows and starred in a Fendi campaign.

Last year, he stole the show in Once Upon a Time, a short video for Chanel that starred Keira Knightley.

In January, he proved himself quite the prankster, when Cara Delevingne persuaded him to tell the Chanel Creative Director, 'You're fired!'

Hudson's handsome dad met Mr Lagerfeld on a shoot for V Man several years ago, and Mr Kroenig has said that without Mr Lagerfeld, his modeling career may never have taken off.

Mr Kroenig, has been the face of campaigns for DKNY, Gap, H&M and Roberto Cavalli,

He was also the subject of Metamorphoses of an American, a 2007 book in which Mr Lagerfeld chronicled the Florida native's modeling career.

Miss Smalls, 26, was born in Puerto Rico and has appeared in campaigns for Fendi, Givenchy, Lacoste and Gucci.

Mini model: Chanel's métiers d'art show in Scotland last night saw Hudson Kroenig, then four, take his third trip down the runway for Chanel with his father in December 2012

Like a pro: The four-year-old, who refers to Mr Lagerfeld as 'Uncle Karl,' also walked Chanel's autumn/winter 2012 runway on the arm of model Heidi Mount

Debut with dad: Hudson's first appearance in the French fashion house's runway shows was for the spring/summer 2011 show, in which he also walked with Mr Kroenig
