Lingerie boss: Michelle Mone's company have been ordered to pay £15,000 compensation to a former director

A former director of Michelle Mone’s lingerie company who left after discovering a plant pot in his office had been bugged has won his case for unfair dismissal.

Scott Kilday walked out of MJM International when he found a listening device hidden within artificial flowers.

The bug had been set up amid fears that Mr Kilday was planning to leave and work with Mone’s ex-husband Michael.

Mr Kilday, 35, who had the £55,000 role of operations director at MJM, took the firm to an employment tribunal after discovering the lingerie tycoon had listened to recordings.

Following the hearing in Glasgow last September, judges yesterday found in his favour, stating in a written judgement that MJM’s decision to plant the listening device was likely to ‘destroy or seriously damage’ Mr Kilday’s trust in his bosses. He was awarded £15,920.26 in compensation, but a breach of contract claim that he had been entitled to shares worth £25,000 was dismissed by the tribunal.

Last night, Mr Kilday described the process as ‘extremely stressful’, adding: ‘I’m delighted with the result and glad that I can now put it all behind me. At the end of the day, it’s not about the money, but standing up for what’s morally correct and not being bullied into keeping quiet.

‘With the time I dedicated to MJM International, it was unfortunate that it came to this, but I can now walk away with my head held high and, more importantly, my integrity fully intact.’

The tribunal had been told how the situation at MJM became ‘difficult’ after Mone split with her husband and business partner Michael in December 2011.

Mr Mone eventually left after MAS Holdings bought into the business in February last year. Mr Kilday said that around that time Mone asked him to resign as a director and he ‘sought legal advice’.

He also told how Mone had been ‘a very difficult person to work with’ and that his relationship with her had latterly been ‘tense’. He then set up talks with Eliaz Poleg, chairman of the firm following the sale. But days before the meeting, Mr Kilday found the bug. ‘I had a look in the pot and saw a cable coming out, which was wrapped around artificial flowers,’ he said.

The hearing was told the device had been hidden for ‘business strategic reasons’ and had been authorised by Mr Poleg, who told the tribunal that he made the move due to ‘extreme concerns’ over Mr Kilday’s loyalty to the lingerie firm.

It emerged during the hearing that Mr Kilday now works for Mr Mone’s firm Pendulum Apparel.

Last night, a spokesman for Ultimo Brands International said: ‘We are delighted to have won the main aspect of this case relating to the shares of £25,000. With regards to the secondary case, we are in discussions with our lawyers and insurers to review our options to appeal.’
