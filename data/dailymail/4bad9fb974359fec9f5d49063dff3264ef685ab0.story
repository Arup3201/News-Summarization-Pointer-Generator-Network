Jailed: April Piercy, 45, stole £54,00 from the Essex GP surgery she managed in a bid to fund her live and online bingo addiction

A GP surgery manager who stole almost £54,000 from her practice to fuel a bingo addiction has been jailed. 

April Piercy from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, earned £66,000-a-year, but generated huge debts by blowing £140-a-day on both live and online versions of the game.  

To fund her habit, the 45-year-old started signing false invoices from locum doctors at Great Clacton Medical Partnership.

Trusted executive Piercy started the scam in 2001 and carried on betraying her colleagues at the cash-strapped surgery for the next three years. 

She was jailed for 14 months at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday after she admitted fraud by abuse of a position of trust.

Sacha Bailey, prosecuting, said her crime had a huge impact on her practice, which had been struggling financially.

She read a personal impact statement from Dr Ildiko Spelt, a partner at the surgery, saying she was still battling to tackle the impacts of her crime.

Dr Spelt said: 'I relied 100 per cent on April to run the practice so I could focus on my patients.'

Evelyn Hicks, defending, said Piercy had become depressed after both her parents died in the early 2000s and was often burdened by the troubles of colleagues who would confide in her.

Mrs Hicks said Piercy owed a lot of money, including mortgage arrears, meaning her house was about to be repossessed.

She said the gambler had generated around £100,000 worth of debt and faced losing her home.

Mrs Hicks said: 'She played bingo five times per week and that became her lifestyle. The practice was in dire financial difficulties. She has added to it, she has not caused it.'

She said Piercy was now living on benefits after losing her well-paid job.

Judge David Turner, QC, told Piercy: 'This is a tragic day for you. The fact is you have derailed your life, and the sad reality is you have made extremely bad choices for an intelligent person.

'You were someone who was completely trusted, looked at as having commitment and energy, and were paid a decent salary.

'You were not as perhaps well supported personally and you sought solace in what became an addiction to gambling.'

He added: 'It rather took over your life and you wasted much of the monies which you were stealing.

'By raising the bogus invoices you covered your tracks consciously and deliberately and knowing with every one you sent out you were doing something wrong. Your conduct was protracted but out of character.

'I don’t doubt it has left you stressed, depressed and ashamed, and added to the difficulties you have with isolation.

'I hope you manage to survive this sentence and put this tragic and shameful incident behind you and with the help of your friends pick up your life.'

No order was made for compensation as a separate Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is set to be held next month.
