For years philosophers have sought the secret to a fulfilling existence, but now one man claims to have discovered it - and come up with a formula.

Research into what makes people feel happy has led renowned professor, Dr Todd Kashdan, to produce an equation called the Feel Good Formula.

In it, he identifies six factors which, when put together in the right combination, make a happy soul.

Chin up! Could the Feel Good Formula really give you something to smile about?

The factors are: Live in the moment (M), be curious (C), do something you love (L), think of others (T), nurture relationships (N), and take care of you body (B).

The winning formula is Feeling Good = (Mx16 + Cx1 + Lx2) + (Tx5 + Nx2 + Bx33).

Dr Kashdan reviewed the results of nationwide research carried out into how Brits truly feel, inside and out.

Dr Kashdan, author of ‘Curious? Discover the Missing Ingredient to a Fulfilling Life’ drew upon his years of experience to analyse the research.

The equation sets out the perfect formula which incorporates the 'happiness six'. They include: Living in the moment, curiosity, spending time with family, doing something you love, thinking of others first and taking care of your body

Whilst it may not appear obvious how a combination of letters and numbers will make you feel good, Dr Kashdan believes this formula is the perfect prescription for a happy soul.

He said: 'There is no single secret to feeling good, but when these six ingredients are carefully attended to, in the right doses, you will be on target for a happy life.

'Transform’s research shows that Britain is in need of a bit of a lift and it is great to be working with them on this mission to inspire a more upbeat Britain.

'Each of the ingredients requires a bit of work.

'Just know that your hard work will lead to the greatest rewards possible.'

Steven Taylor, Marketing Director at Transform Cosmetic Surgery said: 'We are delighted to have such a well respected figure as Dr Kashdan involved on the Feel Good Campaign and couldn’t be more pleased that the partnership led to the creation of an actual formula to Feel Good.

'We hope that the Feel Good Formula will continue to help boost spirits and put a smile on faces across the UK.'

M Live in the moment - appreciate the 
sounds, smells and sights that you take for granted everyday. Remind 
yourself every waking hour to do this.

C Be curious - explore the unfamiliar, mysterious, complex, and uncertain aspects of our world once a day.

L
 Do something you love - if there is anything that provides the 
framework for a well-lived life it is the presence of activities that 
are important to us and excite us. Do this once at work and once at 
play.

T Think of others first - offer compliments, do a good deed and
 listen. This is not intuitive because many believe you need to love 
yourself before you can love others. Science has found this to be false.
 Do this five times a day and you’ll soon see it feels good to make 
someone feel good.

N Nurture relationships - dedicate time to a 
partner, friend or family member twice a day. Scientists have discovered
 that when you observe the happiest people on the planet, every single 
one has a close, significant relationship with another person.

B Take
 care of your body - no, you do not need three per cent body fat, nor do you need to 
be able to pound through three sets of 15 unassisted handstand push-ups. 
Taking care of your body is about healthy eating at least three times a day 
and committing 30 minutes per day to exercise.
