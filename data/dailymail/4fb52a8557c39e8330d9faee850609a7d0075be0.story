NBA star Amar'e Stoudemire has revealed he's been taking red wine baths over the past six months to help rejuvenate his body.

The 31-year-old, who has had long-standing problems with his knees during his career, believes the remedy has helped him recover much better after games and revitalised him.

It certainly seems to have done the trick, with Stoudemire playing in three pre-season games for the New York Knicks in just four nights in the past week.

- A beauty therapy process where the residue of wine is soaked into the skin.

- Grape seeds, stems and skins contain high quantities of powerful antioxidants, minerals, pectic, sugars, tannins and vitamins, all of which are fundamental to the skin's well being.

- The combination of these elements serve to fortify the skin by reducing inflammation and slowing the skin’s ageing process.

- The pulp in the wine in particular has excellent exfoliating qualities and helps reduce the problems associated with ageing.

When speaking to reporters after a training session on Thursday he said on the treatment: 'The red wine bath is very important to me because it allows me to create more circulation in my red blood cells.

'Plus, it's very hot, so it's like a hot tub. But it's also the red wine ... it just kind of soothes the body.

'Also, you have the ancient tub, so you have like a salt tub and a hot tub, cold plunge and a pool - and you just kind of mix it all up.'

Stoudemire, entering his 13th season of his NBA career, revealed that after his last outing his body and surgically repaired knees felt great on his day off.

He added: 'After doing that recovery day, my legs felt rejuvenated. I felt great, so I'm going to continue to do that for sure.'

Stoudemire is currently in the final year of his contract at the Knicks but has no immediate plans to retire just yet.
