The Chinese football authority has announced plans to recruit a first batch of 120 foreign coaches by the end of 2015 to help teach pupils in primary and secondary schools, according to People's Daily Online.

The news comes as a part of the 'Campus Football Promotion Campaign', which is widely understood as the country's effort to turn the nation into a football powerhouse by raising a generation of all-conquering young footballers.

China's current president Xi Jinping is a massive fan of the game and is keen to see his country qualifying for another World Cup -- and ultimately winning it.

Apart from importing coaching talent from overseas, the authority also confirmed that it is to make football a mandatory lesson in 6,000 selected schools as well as launching football leagues on campus from September this year.

6,000 primary and secondary schools in China have been chosen to specialise in football. In these schools, pupil will have one football lesson every week 

The authority is also hoping to recruit and train 30,000-50,000 football teachers in 2015 across China 

The series of new football-oriented education reforms were announced by Wang Dengfeng, Deputy President of Chinese Football Association, during an interview.

'The desired foreign coaches need to come from countries that are traditionally good with the sport, especially those who are particularly experienced with training youngsters,' said Wang, who is also in charge of the Culture, Hygiene and Arts section in the Ministry of Education in China.

The first batch of 120 foreign coaches will be sent to 40 cities around the country. 

Wang stressed that they are not recruited to train professional football teams, but to teach ordinary schoolchildren in primary and secondary schools.

Every pupil in China will be required to learn basic football skills such as 'balancing on a ball' and doing 'keepy-uppy' with their insteps

The country's Ministry of Education plans to build an army of local football teachers too. The expectation is to recruit and train 30,000 of 50,000 of them in 2015 throughout China.

Outstanding retired athletes from the army will also be arranged to work as PE teachers, according to Wang.

Professional football leagues will also be launched this year in all tiers of academic institutions, from primary schools to universities. Wang expects the leagues will create at least 290 champion teams from primary schools alone.

'Campus football competitions will be mainly organised by schools,' he said, 'and the aim is to cultivate public interest and to create a football culture.'

The Chinese authority has already made football a compulsory part of the national curriculum for schoolchildren. 

In normal schools, the sport will be a mandatory course for at least one semester during pupils' academic years; whereas in the country's newly established 6,000 football-specialisedd schools, schoolchildren will receive one football lesson every week.

Additionally, 30 football 'experts' in China are working on drafting the country's first set of football textbooks. 

These textbooks will be completed at the end of this month by the People's Education Press (PEP) and put to use from this September.
