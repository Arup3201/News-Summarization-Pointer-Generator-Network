A honeymoon is the perfect chance for the newlywed couple to spend time with each other, away from the stresses of everyday life.

But Kat and Steve Turner, have taken that idea and run with it - or ridden with it.

Rather than taking time out for some post-wedding luxuriating on a beach or at a spa hotel, the couple decided to spend two years in a record-breaking attempt to travel the world on a tandem bicycle, sleeping in a tiny two-man tent.

Incredibly, Kat, 31, had never even ridden a bike more than a few yards before they decided to take on the challenge, which they began in May this year.

A bicycle made for two: Kat and Steve Turner are attempting to break the world record for the longest tandem ride ever

Odyssey:  Over two years, the couple plan to cycle from New Zealand back to their home in Forest Hill, London

The honeymoon represents an 
extraordinary and testing celebration of their wedding vows, which they 
made in August 2011 just eight months before they set off for 
Christchurch in New Zealand.

The
 intrepid couple gave up well-paid jobs as a teacher and caseworker for 
the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman before leaving their 
chickens and cat at their home in Forest Hill, south east London, with 
friends who will spend the next two years house-sitting.

Six
 months and almost 9,000km later they arrived in Darwin, on the northern
 tip of Australia, having braved arctic temperatures, snow, heavy rain 
and high winds, followed by searing heat and the mechanical challenges 
of pushing Hooch, their heavily-laden tandem, to the limit.

Epic ride: The couple's journey from New Zealand to London via three continents will last well into 2014

Caseworker Kat said: 'The 
first four months of this trip were so hard. We cycled through gallons 
of rain and waves of gales.

'My feet felt like they were constantly soaked and at times I wanted to give up so much, so that I could enjoy a beer and good company with friends or the warmth of a fire or a Sunday roast at mum’s or a belly-aching laugh with my brother or a family knees-up in Plymouth.

'And dare I say it, even working in a dry office felt appealing at times.'

But completing Australasia represents
 less than a quarter of the monumental trip and the pair are now in 
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, as part of the start of the marathon Asian leg 
of their journey, which will take them through Indonesia, Thailand, 
Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and into China.

Once through China, they plan to go 
into Pakistan, Iran, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia and into Turkey, when 
the European leg of the adventure will start. The couple hope to return 
to the UK in early 2014, having beaten the previous world record of 
38,143kms set by Phil and Louise Shambrook 15 years ago.

They
 are completing the trip to raise money for British international 
development charity Practical Action, which uses technology to help 
solve the problems of people living in poverty in the developing world.

Steve, 33, who taught at South
 Park Primary School in Ilford said: 'We have found the first months 
very hard and we haven't had the energy or the contacts to do very much 
other than cycle, which isn’t exactly a traditional way of enjoying a 
honeymoon!

The couple get some practice in the UK before setting off on their global odyssey

'At first, we
 were also not sure whether we could do what we were planning to do but 
now that we have completed six months and the Australian Outback we feel
 much more confident that we can do this.

'If we do, it will be the most amazing achievement. The world record is just something we added in as a fun extra.

'It
 shouldn’t take away from the more important things on our trip, which 
is how we cope with all the adventures and challenges we have on the 
way. We will see people living in poverty and struggling to survive, 
which will make us even more determined to raise money for Practical 
Action.'
