A pensioner has spent £40,000 on cosmetic surgery in order to hang onto her looks.

Katy Bedford, 75, who has been under the knife 18 times to keep her face wrinkle free, claims the only downside of her cosmetic addiction is that people won't stand up for her on the bus - because she doesn't look old enough.

The pensioner, from Salisbury, Wilts, has never hidden her love of surgery and books herself in at the clinic at the first sign of getting  'turkey neck'.

Katy Bedford, 75, has spent £40k on 18 cosmetic procedures to stay looking young and wrinkle-free 

Katy first had surgery - a lower facelift with a Harley Street surgeon (left) - aged 47 in 1986

Katy, a retired actress, said: 'As soon as I don't like what I see I say: "Oh well, I'll have something else done". 

'It has been worth every penny.

'I wanted to look in the mirror and like what I saw smiling back at me - the effects of ageing aren't attractive at all'

Katy first had surgery - a lower facelift with a Harley Street surgeon - aged 47 in 1986.

Since then she has been perfecting her face and body with an average of one trip to the surgeon every 18 months.

No step is too far for the obsessed OAP, who followed the masses of Brits that head abroad every year to go under the knife by having a lower facelift in Zagreb, Croatia.

She returned in 2007 for liposuction on her legs, and again in 2008 to have a bump taken out of her nose.

Katy, 75, used to work as an actress but retired several years ago 

Her most recent round of plastic surgery involved another facelift, a neck lift in April 2012, a brow and cheek uplift and liposuction on her stomach just seven months later, and liposuction on her and right leg three months after that.

Just last October, she had another series of liposuction to her right leg, hips, stomach, and her chest.

Katy said: 'I just love it when the surgery is over and there's a three pounds of Katy left on the table.'

And the mum-of-one hasn't said no to going back under the knife if she feels like she needs another nip or a tuck.

She said: 'I'd never say never. My worst nightmare would be getting 'turkey neck', (even) if I was 100 I would have that done, I think it's hideous.' 

Katy, 75, claims people are often shocked to discover her age 

So far, Katy has no regrets and she couldn't be happier with her results, and is full of praise for the skills of her most recent surgeon, Mohammad Azhar Aslam of Linia Cosmetic Surgery.

She added: 'He is absolutely marvellous - really I couldn't have asked for better treatment.

'He's even managed to do some of my procedures under local anesthetic so that I can smile for him during the surgery and he can get my face absolutely right.'

Although her daughter Sara-Madge Wynne, 34, a physicist working in Edinburgh, was at first hesitant about her mother's many cosmetic procedures, Katy says she soon came round to the idea.

Katy said: 'My daughter raises her eyebrows and says "Oh mum, you're not going to get another disgusting thing done to your face are you?"

Katy has undergone 18 different cosmetic surgeries since 1986 

'But we were on holiday once and we saw a coach load of old dears trundling off their coach and I looked at them and I said:"'Would you rather that I looked like them?"

'And she of course said "no, you just carry on as you are." 

'I did promise her that I'd never look younger than her though.

'I always said that I wanted to do my improvements gently and little by little - it's awful when you suddenly see someone whose whole face has changed dramatically.

'If hadn't been so open about it I think even some of my closest friends and family wouldn't have noticed.

'I am able to feel exactly as I want and as soon as I don't, I head back to the surgeon.

'When it comes to luggage at a train stations I'm happy to point out to people that just because I don't look my age, I still need help with my suitcase.

'I'm the first person to say "I'm nearly 76 you know," to people who might be able to help me down the stairs.

'Most people are very surprised when I tell them, they normally just say - you look good for your age.

'But I think it's obvious that I must have had work done - nobody looks like this naturally. 

'But people always think that people who have been under the knife look plastic and stretched - I think I'm quite the opposite.'

Katy's surgeon at Linia Cosmetic Surgery, Azhar Aslamsaid: 'In my practice I've always had much older people - my oldest facelift was 89 but she was very active and just wanted to look better for the rest of their lives.

'Age itself is not a restriction but health is of course a crucial factor. We need to be sure that surgery can be done in a safe manner.

'People have surgery for all sorts of reasons, I had one lady who was moving to Spain in her 70s and wanted her breasts and arms to look good in a bikini.

'Just because you're older, your desire to look better to look better hasn't gone.'
