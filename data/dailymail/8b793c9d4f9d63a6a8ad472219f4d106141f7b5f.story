Susie Dent turned 50 last year, despite interviews and online biographies suggesting she is 47

She is the queen of Dictionary Corner, but after more than two decades on words and numbers quiz Countdown it seems Susie Dent still has a problem with maths.

The Oxford-educated lexicographer, who reveals the best possible answers for the anagram puzzles, quietly celebrated her 50th birthday last November.

But in internet biographies and previous interviews she is stated as being three years younger.

Representatives for the mother-of-two said there has never been any attempt to hide her age but that it never seemed important enough to correct if printed somewhere incorrectly. 

On the Internet Movie Database website, which records everyone who works on a television or film production, her birthday is listed as September 21, 1967, which would make her 47.

In an interview in June last year her age was given as 46 – which tallies with the entry on IMDb but is incorrect.

However, in a 2005 article written by her former Countdown colleague Carol Vorderman on the joys of being a woman in her 40s, Miss Dent is correctly said to be 41.

On the discussion pages of Wikipedia, her age is so hotly contested that it has become a running joke, with users posting comments such as: ‘As an angel, Susie Dent has no date of birth.’ 

Users seem to have worked out her correct age by piecing together various sources, including obtaining a copy of her birth certificate.

It was also confirmed by one of her contemporaries at her £4,200-a-term school, who posted: ‘I was at school at the Marist Convent, Sunninghill, with Susan Dent and she was born in 1964, as I was. She had an older sister called Nicola.’

Miss Dent, who attended private school, was born in Woking, Surrey, in 1964 to Malcolm and Shirley Dent. She now lives in Oxford with her partner Paul Atkins, 42, and daughters Lucy, 15, and Thea, seven.

She first appeared on Countdown in 1992, at the age of 27, and has been the show’s resident word expert in almost 2,500 episodes. Her more than 22-year stint has been interrupted only by short breaks because of illness and maternity leave.

Her role is to come up with answers for the show’s anagrams. However, it was revealed in 2009 that she is sometimes fed help by producers through an earpiece.

Yesterday a representative for Miss Dent said she did not want to comment but added: ‘I imagine she celebrates her birthday every year with her family.’
