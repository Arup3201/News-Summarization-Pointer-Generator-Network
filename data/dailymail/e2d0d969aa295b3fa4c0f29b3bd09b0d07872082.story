Officials say the search for a prominent outdoors writer on Mount Rainier was suspended after a woman's body was found, but the remains weren't immediately identified, officials said.

Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Patti Wold said that the body was recovered about 3 p.m. PDT in the general area where teams had been searching for 70-year-old Karen Sykes.

She said that the woman's body was found off the trail near Boundary Creek in rough, steep terrain - an area difficult to access and not commonly traveled.

There was no immediate word on the cause of death, and Wold said the medical examiner would determine the woman's identity.

Park officials had announced earlier in the day that the search had been suspended but did not elaborate.

Missing: Crews continue to search Mount Rainier National Park for Seattle hiker Karen Sykes, who was reported missing late Wednesday

Sykes hasn't been seen since she separated from her hiking partner on Wednesday.

She was reportedly working on a story when she and her partner encountered snow about 5,000 feet. Her partner stayed as she went on, with the idea that they'd reconvene, but she never turned up.

The partner, who made it safely back to the trailhead, reported her missing at 10:30 p.m. Wednesday.

Six ground crews, including two dog teams, combed an expanded search area near the Owyhigh Lakes Trail on Rainier's east side Saturday. Rescuers also searched by air.

Sykes, had adequate survival gear to camp overnight in an emergency, Wold said.

Her friends had hoped that searchers would find her safely sheltered.

Safety concerns for Sykes and search crews included snow bridges, tree wells and steep, wet, slippery terrain, Wold said. A searcher was hurt Thursday when he punched through a snow bridge and was airlifted out of the search area.

Sykes is well-known in the Northwest hiking community and has written numerous hiking stories for online publications and newspapers. She is also a photographer and has authored a book about hikes in western Washington.

Her disappearance comes weeks after six climbers are believed to have fallen to their deaths while attempting to climb a challenging route to the summit of the 14,410-foot peak southeast of Seattle.

Crews scoured the Owyhigh Lakes area of Mount Rainer hoping to find Sykes. They focused on the length of the eight-mile trail on Thursday.

Lola Kemp, a close friend who planned to hike with Sykes this weekend, said in an email Friday that she was anxious but still hopeful that searchers will find Sykes, safely sheltered somewhere.

'She is the guru of trails,' said Kemp, adding that Sykes hikes at least twice a week and has a background in climbing and scrambling.

'I find it difficult to imagine that she would get lost. I think it's more likely she's injured and waiting, perhaps impatiently, to be rescued.'

Greg Johnston, a former outdoors writer for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, said Sykes was an avid, strong hiker who knew the mountain extremely well.

'She's the last person anyone would expect to get lost, particularly on Mount Rainier,' said Johnston, who recruited Sykes to write a weekly hiking feature for that newspaper, which ran for more than a decade.

'If anybody can survive it, it's her. She's really tough and really savvy.'

Mount Rainier, a dormant volcano located near Seattle, spawns six major rivers and is a well-known hiking destination

Search teams were scouring steep, rugged terrain in the Owyhigh Lakes area for a second day Friday. They were focused along the length of the 8-mile Owyhigh Lakes Trail.

In a separate search, an injured climber was airlifted Thursday off Double Peak after crews responded to a spot-locator beacon.
