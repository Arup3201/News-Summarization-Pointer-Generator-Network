Photos of the Rome hotel room in which late actor James Gandolfini spent his final moments have emerged as the star's body was flown back to the United States today ahead of his funeral on Thursday.

In room 449 of the art deco Boscolo Exedra Roma hotel, a $671 per night suite overlooking the Piazza della Repubblic, Gandolfini died June 19 of a massive heart attack.

Pictures show the ornate marble bathroom in which the actor was found by his 13-year-old son and where paramedics worked to save the 51-year-old before rushing him to Policlinico Umberto I hospital.

Celebrity chef Sandra Lee would later 
stay in the finely appointed room on Friday, until learning it was the 
very same in which Gandolfini took ill.

When media learned that Lee had been so quickly placed in the suite, they pounced. Sources told the New York Post that Lee was ‘saddened’ when she learned of the fourth floor room’s recent history.

Lee was in town with her sister and nieces. Room 449 was one of several she’d rented for their trip.

As Italian media began to swarm, Lee and company left after only one night.

The man who found fame playing a mafia boss was vacationing in Rome prior to the Taormina Film Festival, which he was slated to attend in Sicily over the weekend.

The actor's body left Rome's Fiumicino airport at around 1600 GMT (1200 ET) on a private flight, an airport official said.

Family
 friend Michael Kobold, speaking to reporters in Rome, thanked the 
Italian authorities and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry for helping 
to accelerate procedures.

Gandolfini was set to receive an award at the festival. He instead received a tribute on Saturday.

Gandolfini and his son toured the Vatican prior to his death as they awaited the arrival of his sister.

Leta Gandolfini, one of the actor's two older sisters who both live in New Jersey, appeared grief-last stricken last week as she arrived at the morgue flanked by security guards.

An autopsy on Friday confirmed that 
the actor died of a heart attack and that there were no suspicious 
factors, such as alcohol, on his medical report.

He was taken by ambulance to the hospital around 10:40pm Wednesday night.

He
 was reportedly alive as six men removed him from the Hotel Exedra, but 
had entered cardiac arrest by the time he reached the hospital.

Doctors worked for over half an hour, trying to bring the actor back, but it was to no avail.

Room 449: Gandolfini was staying in the grand suite when he died June 19. Celebrity chef Sandra Lee and her family would quickly be placed in the suite, before they learned of its recent history and checked out

Morbid: The bathroom of room 449 of the Boscolo Exedra Roma hotel. Gandolfini suffered a heart attack here June 19. The hotel would quickly book new guests in the room, including celebrity chef Sandra Lee

'The resuscitation maneuvers, 
including heart massage etc., continued for 40 minutes and then, seeing 
no electric activity from the heart, this was interrupted and we 
declared James dead,'  emergency room chief Claudio Modini said.

'The
 patient was considered dead on arrival, and for that reason an autopsy 
has been requested to be carried out by a pathologist, as is normal 
procedure in our country.'

The alarm was first raised when son Michael called the hotel’s front desk after finding his father in the bathroom.

The night before his death, Gandolfini dined with Michael in Rome's Trastevere neighborhood.

His waiter Andrei Burca told the New York Post: 'He had a big smile, a big laugh, and looked happy.'

Grieving: Gandolfini's widow and the mother of his baby daughter Liliana, Deborah Lin, was seen out shopping in Los Angeles June 21 as she and her late husband's family prepare for his funeral later this week

But just 24 hours later, Michael found him suffering from a heart attack in the bathroom of their hotel room. Doctors battled for 40 minutes to save him but he was later pronounced dead.

Gandolfini’s body was initially slated to be flown to the U.S.by Wednesday or Thursday, and his funeral held in New York.

'In Italy, it can take up to 10 days to get all the necessary documents and paperwork to repatriate the body. We are looking forward to working with the Italian government and officials to shorten that process,' family friend and spokesman Michael Kobold originally said.

But, on Sunday, those plans appeared to accelerate.

That's when Kobold told reporters that the 'provisional plan' is to depart Rome on Monday afternoon for the United States, several days earlier than anticipated. He did not specify which U.S. airport.

The Italian news agency ANSA later released photos of the body departing Rome.

The agency says the private plane took off at 6 pm Sunday. Its exact U.S. destination was unclear.

A room at the Hotel Boscolo Exedra Roma costs about $671. Gandolfini was staying there before a planned trip to Sicily, where he was slated to receive an award

No warning: The actor, seen here in April, reportedly had no prior heart problems. He was photographed eating at a Rome restaurant with son Michael the day before his death. His funeral is slated for sometime next week

Family spokesman Michael Kobold had told reporters the "provisional plan" was to repatriate Gandolfini's body Monday.

Kobold thanked Italian and U.S. 
authorities, including U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, his 
predecessor Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton for 
helping with arrangements.

Deborah Lin, who had been married to 
Gandolfini for five years, was spotted at a Los Angeles shopping mall 
buying clothes for their baby daughter before the funeral.

Final photo? A fellow diner snapped this shot of Gandolfini the night before he died. 'He had a big smile, a big laugh, and looked happy' said Andrei Burca, a waiter at the hotel's outdoor restaurant

In Gandolfini's home state of New 
Jersey, flags will be flown at half-mast on state buildings on Monday, 
New Jersey governor Chris Christie said.

The actor rose to fame playing a 
hitman in the 1993 film True Romance, and roles in films such as 
Terminal Velocity and Get Shorty followed.

However, it was not until his breakout role in 1999 in the hit television show The Sopranos that he  became a household name.

Since 'The Sopranos' ended its six-season run in June 2007, Gandolfini had appeared in a number of big-screen roles, including the crime drama 'Killing Them Softly' and 'Zero Dark Thirty', a film about the hunt for Osama bin Laden.

Gandolfini had been working on an upcoming HBO series, 'Criminal Justice,' and had two films due out next year.
