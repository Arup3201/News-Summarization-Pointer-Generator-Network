Hidden under a thick blanket of snow and shrouded in fog, the remote village of Solovki and its isolated monastery could have sprung from the pages of a fairy story.

The monastery stands proud over the bleak landscape of the Solovetsky Islands, a tiny archipelago tucked away in the White Sea, more than 775 miles from St Petersburg and a boat ride away to the nearest mainland town of Belomorsk in north west Russia.

Founded by two hermit monks in the 15th century, the Russian Orthodox Solovestsky Monastery swept aside its humble beginnings and distant location to become one of the wealthiest landowners and most influential religious centres in all of Russia by the end of the 16th century.
