Britain is prepared to break ranks with the international community to arm Syrian rebels, David Cameron said yesterday.

In an intervention that will raise fears of being sucked into another foreign war, the Prime Minister said there was ‘danger in inaction’ over a conflict that has claimed 70,000 lives.

He suggested Britain would try to  persuade other European Union countries to lift an embargo on arming rebels when the current sanctions lapse in May.

But he said it was ‘not out of the question we might have to do things in our own way’. This could involve vetoing an extension of the EU arms embargo so the UK could send guns and ammunition to groups fighting to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad.

He revealed officials have drawn up emergency legislation to bring in a looser package of unilateral sanctions against Syria if the EU prohibitions lapse. Mr Cameron told the Commons liaison  committee: ‘We are still an independent country – we can have an independent foreign policy.

‘If, for instance, we felt that action needed to be taken to help bring about change in Syria, to help end this appalling bloodshed, and if we felt our European partners were holding that back, then we’d have to change the approach. But that’s not what I hope will happen.’

Richard Ottaway, Tory chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, warned British weapons could fall into jihadist hands in the country.

He told the Prime Minister: ‘It is widely accepted that jihadists are gathering from all over the world to fight their cause in Syria. Don’t you think it would be a  mistake to start arming rebels who we don’t really know their identity and whose intentions are uncertain?’

Mr Cameron acknowledged the danger, but added: ‘The point I would make is – there is a danger in inaction. While the world stood by and has frankly not done enough in Syria, what has happened? As well as 70,000 people being killed, you’ve seen jihadist elements, as it were, grow.’

He added: ‘My argument is by working with the opposition, by supplying parts of the opposition and helping parts of the opposition you can at least have some influence with your partners.’

Foreign Secretary William Hague announced last week Britain will send non-lethal military equipment, including armoured cars and body armour, to rebel fighters. It followed the relaxation, at Britain’s request, of EU sanctions.

The commander of the rebel Free Syrian Army, General Salim Idriss, has called for the lifting of the EU embargo.
