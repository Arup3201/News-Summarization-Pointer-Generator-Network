Arrested and facing deportation: David Duke

Former Ku-Klux-Klan leader and white supremacist David Duke has been arrested in Germany hours before he was due to speak at a far-right gathering.

Duke, who is a rabid anti-Semite who has been speech-making as a VIP guest to right-wing groups across Europe for the past two years from a home he owns in Austria, is now fighting deportation to the U.S.

At a time of heightened tensions in Germany following a spate of killings by neo-Nazis, it is no surprise the country wants shot of the 61-year-old after he was seized by police last Friday near Cologne.

He has been released and is now out on bail while deportation formalities are completed.

Duke promised on his website to fight deportation, throwing in a plea to supporters to send him money as he was now engaged in a 'desperate fight.'

'While most of you will be getting ready for the warmth and love and friendship and family of Christmas, I will be far from home fighting the good fight,” he wrote.

'It will require a lot of time and effort.'

Police in Cologne said Duke is 'obliged to leave German territory without delay.' 

But they have now instigated formal proceedings to have him kicked out.

The arrest seems linked to Duke's expulsion from Czech Republic in 2009, following his detention there on suspicion of denying the Holocaust, a crime in many European countries, but especially in Germany.

The Cologne police statement said that Duke 'was not entitled to stay in Germany' because of a travel ban against him in another, unspecified European country.

Duke, a former neo-Nazi who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. presidency in 1988 and 1992, served a year in prison in 2003 and 2004 after pleading guilty to tax fraud and stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from supporters to pay gambling debts.

He routinely calls the Holocaust of six million Jews during WW2 a 'myth' and offers support to fellow travellers who like to deny the existence of the Nazi gas chambers.

In the statement on his website, Duke added that German authorities had arrested him in order to silence his 'message of heritage and freedom.

German police yesterday announced the arrest in a raid in Jena, in the former eastern Germany, of the right-wing extremist Ralf Wohlleben, in connection with the neo-Nazi murders which have terrified the country.

The 36-year-old is being held on six counts of accessory to murder and one of attempted murder for his alleged involvement with the far-right terrorist organisation known as the National Socialist Underground.

Investigators have said they are looking at about 10 people in total with regard to the killing of eight people of Turkish origin and a Greek man between 2000 and 2006 and a policewoman in 2007.

It also is being investigated in connection with several other possible hate crimes and a string of bank robberies over the past decade.

Prosecutors said the group is believed linked to two bombings in Cologne targeting foreigners in 2001 and 2004, which wounded more than 20 people.
