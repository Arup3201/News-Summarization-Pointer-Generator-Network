Only a few months ago she was knocking on death's door.

Angel the puppy weighed just 14kgs when she arrived at Cardiff Dogs Home, was 'barely able to stand' and was described as a 'bag of bones' by shocked vets.

After being nursed back to health and doubling in weight the brown and white cross-breed is unrecognisable for animal she was - and she's currently looking for a new home.

 'Bag of bones': Angel weighed just 14kgs when she arrived at Cardiff Dogs Home

Transformation: After being nursed back to health and doubling in weight the brown and white cross-breed is unrecognisable

Angel was abandoned by her owners and when she was brought to the dogs centre she was so badly malnourished that she had a 'body condition score' of zero. 

A spokesman for Cardiff Dogs Home said: 'You would hardly recognise her as the same dog now.

'When she was brought in she was desperately undernourished, and could barely stand. She was seen by the vets, she had a body condition score of zero.

'She weighed just 14kgs. How on earth she was still alive is a mystery.'

Neglected: The RSPCA tried to track down Angel's cruel owners in order to prosecute them for neglect - but they were unable to trace them

Sickening: When Angel was brought to the dog centre she was so badly malnourished that she had a 'body condition score' of zero

The RSPCA tried to track down Angel's cruel owners in order to prosecute them for neglect - but were unable to trace them.

One-year-old Angel put on six pounds after just six days at the home for abandoned dogs.

They have been putting her through 'gentle exercise' to help her to build up muscle mass and now weighs around 28kgs.

Despite her phenomenal transformation in appearance she still has a little way to go to reach her optimum weight.

They added: 'She is going to need to build up some muscle mass, and this is going to take an age of gentle exercise to build her up.'

Happy: Dog carers have been putting her through 'gentle exercise' to help her to build up muscle mass

Appeal: Cardiff Dogs Home is currently looking for a new home for one-year-old Angel
