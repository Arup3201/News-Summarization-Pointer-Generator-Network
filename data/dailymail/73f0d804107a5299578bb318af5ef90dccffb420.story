An Army machine gunner accidentally shot his colleague several times by mistake in Afghanistan in just one of a catalogue of military gun blunders, it can be revealed.

The guardsman from the First Battalion of the Welsh Guards hit his colleague repeatedly in the leg at Camp Bastion with the light machine gun in April last year.

It is unclear if he was disciplined following the accident and the Ministry of Defence refused to release any further details.

Fatal gun accident: Fusilier James Wilkinson, 21, who was shot dead by mistake in 2011 as his colleagues took a barrel off a machine gun in Kenya

An investigation found soldiers have accidentally shot themselves 14 times and hit colleagues three times with stray bullets in the last two years.

In total, there were 30 recorded cases where troops have fired off their guns by mistake since January 2012, according to figures released to MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act.

All the incidents came after Fusilier James Wilkinson, 21, was shot dead by mistake in 2011 as his colleagues took a barrel off a machine gun during a live firing exercise while it was was pointed directly at him.

In other incidents:

There are fears the total number of gun accidents may be far higher as troops are only obliged to report negligent discharges where there are injuries.

Gun accident victim: Fusilier Wilkinson, of Bury, Greater Manchester, from the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was killed by his own men in an accident in Nanyuki, Kenya, in 2011

Critics said that troops cannot properly be held to account unless all gun accidents are properly recorded.

Fusilier Wilkinson, of Bury, Greater Manchester, from the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was killed by his own men in an accident in Nanyuki, Kenya, in 2011 which was described as 'wholly and utterly avoidable' at a court martial.

The weapon jammed during an exercise - and Fusilier Wilkinson was shot in the neck as troops removed the barrel to inspect it.

Staff Sergeant Patrick Price and Corporal Colin Bell were jailed for 21 and 14 months respectively after being found guilty of negligently performing a duty by the court martial.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the figures should be viewed 'in context'.

'Of approximately 6000 personnel currently serving in Afghanistan all carry a personal weapon and some personnel may have two, for example a pistol and a rifle,' he said.

'All military personnel are required to train on live weapons as part of routine military training. In order to maintain operational effectiveness approximately 180,000 serving members of the Regular Armed Forces will regularly train with live ammunition.

'Regardless of the strict procedures in place around weapon handling and safety inevitably this carries risk.

'The safety and security of our personnel is our top priority so we have strict rules and guidelines in place to manage the use of firearms on operations and during training. Personnel also undergo rigorous weapon handling training.

'Any incident of negligent discharge is thoroughly investigated by the chain of command to discover the cause and prevent any possible recurrence.'
