Forget the idea of an old-fashioned ski lodge, the newest Club Med hotel in the French Alps oozes Scandinavian style, chic design and some rather unusual accessories. 

But with bars and beer taps on each floor, an outdoor Jacuzzi for relaxation and a location just steps from the slopes, it seems this new resort has it all. 

Val Thorens Sensations is a hotel with a distinctive, quirky design, luxurious touches and even  a climbing wall in the foyer.

What greets guests when they walk into the reception at Club Med: Val Thorens Sensations

The sleek, Scandinavian-style bedrooms boast gigantic beds and a luxurious seating area

Bedrooms feature a wall mounted television that has access to English channels and a vast library of movies

Every balcony faces the slopes to give guests excellent views and as much sunshine as possible

The new resort is the first of its kind to be completely crowd-sourced. Through Facebook, locals and Club Med fans were invited to vote for what they wanted from the huge 384-room hotel.

In response, the look and feel of the resort were tailored based on feedback, from the carpet colours to the new sports facilities.

Stepping foot inside the hotel you can't help but be in awe at the scale of the complex. It takes 15 minutes to walk from one block of rooms to another.

The bedrooms are all designed so they face the sun, ensuring guests get the most sunshine on offer flooding into the rooms that come complete with a behemoth sized bed and luxurious seating area.

One of the many quirky areas in the main dining room is an indoor Yurt

The hotel has a main restaurant that serves buffet food with a handful of chefs cooking fresh meals to order as well as Epicurious, a separate dining area that offers picnic style food, a wine cellar and even a deli and grocery section.

For the boozy members of your party, there is a bar or beer tap on every floor and during the night the fourth floor Prism bar turns into a nightclub, complete with a bizarre-but-must-see French take on Butlins style entertainment.

Interestingly, Club Med recently published a report that revealed that families are 'gramping' or going on ski holidays with the grandparents. This new trend also revealed that grandparents are more inclined to pay for the whole holiday as a treat for the family.

Grandparents were repeatedly cited as an important part of the modern ski holiday with a fifth of holidaymakers having skied with extended family and grandparents in the last two years, probably because they provide excellent free childcare.

However, here is where one of the best parts of the Club Med all inclusive concept comes into play. Private ski lessons with the top ESF ski instructors are actually included in your price.

What does that mean for you? Well it means that you can either ski as a whole family or split off into three groups without having to worry that anyone is at risk of hurting themselves.

Guests are also given the chance to practice their climbing skills with this indoor climbing wall

To be honest, even if you don't need the lessons, it's worth getting an instructor, just because you can save so much time jumping queues at gondolas and chairlifts. And they're sure to  offer local knowledge and some helpful pointers about technique along the way.

One thing you should be aware of is that ski, board and boot rental aren't included in the price and will set you back another £150 depending on how much rental gear you need.

I preferred to hit the slopes on my snowboard. And after a day of trying (and failing) to beat a five-time Winter Olympian (Graham Bell is a resort ambassador) there was nothing better than heading back to the resort, soaking up the spa and heading for a drink.

I can safely say I steered clear of that climbing wall all week.
