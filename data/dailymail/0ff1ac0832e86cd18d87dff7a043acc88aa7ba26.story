David Cameron has echoed the US in warning President Bashar Assad that the use of chemical weapons would be ‘completely unacceptable’.

The Prime Minister said following a phone call with Barack Obama that Britain would be forced to ‘revisit’ its approach to Syria if these weapons were deployed.

Downing Street said the two leaders agreed there was ‘much more to do’ to stop the killing of thousands of civilians in Syria.

Threat: Syrian President Bashar Assad is said to be in control of a sizeable stockpile of chemical weapons

Mr Cameron’s comments are the clearest suggestion yet that the UK might contemplate military intervention if chemical weapons were used by the Assad regime.

The Prime Minister also discussed the situation with French president Francois Hollande and the two agreed to ‘work more closely to identify how they could bolster the opposition and help a potential transitional Syrian government after the inevitable fall of Assad’.

Earlier this week, Mr Obama warned any movement of Syria’s stockpile of chemical weapons would be a ‘red line’.

The President said he had ‘at this point not ordered military engagement’. But he added: ‘There would be enormous consequences if we start seeing movement on the chemical weapons front or the use of chemical weapons.’

Syria holds the world’s fourth-largest stockpile of such weapons. Deploying and using them would exacerbate a refugee influx to neighbouring countries including Turkey, which has already received more than 70,000 Syrians.

Western leaders also fear the armaments could fall into the wrong hands.

Last month, a Syrian foreign ministry spokesman insisted they would never be deployed inside the country.

Chinese state media have accused Mr Obama of planning to use Syria’s chemical arsenal as an excuse for military intervention.

Meanwhile, Russia yesterday insisted it had guarantees from Syria that it will not use or move the weapons.

Both countries have repeatedly blocked attempts to impose tougher UN sanctions on Syria. But a Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cameron and Mr Obama had ‘agreed that the use – or threat – of chemical weapons was completely unacceptable and would force them to revisit their approach so far’.

A spokesman added: ‘The Prime Minister restated the risk to the wider region posed by the fighting and the fact that regional and international co-operation was vital.’

The leaders also ‘firmly agreed there was much more to do in order to help put Syria on a path towards peace and stability’.

Fierce fighting raged in Damascus yesterday, with regime forces shelling several areas of the southern city before tanks continued the assault. The northern city of Aleppo saw battles in which Amnesty International warned civilians were enduring a ‘horrific violence.’ At least 41 were reported dead in the bombardment of Damascus over the past 24 hours.

Human rights groups say more than 20,000 people have been killed since the uprising against Assad’s regime began in March last year.

On Tuesday the United Nations claimed Iran appears to be supplying Assad's regime with funds, weapons and intelligence support.

Syrian rebels also say Tehran has sent Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah fighters to assist government forces.

'The
 Secretary-General has repeatedly expressed his concern about the arms 
flows to the two parties in Syria, which in some cases appear to violate
 resolution 1747 passed by this council banning arms exports under 
Chapter 7 authority,' U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman told 
the U.N. Security Council.

Next week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will attend a summit meeting of leaders of non-aligned developing nations in Iran.

He will also meet with senior Iranian officials to discuss 'Iran's nuclear program, terrorism, human rights and the crisis in Syria,' his spokesman said.

A U.N. Security Council panel of independent experts that monitors sanctions against Iran has uncovered several examples of Iran transferring arms to Syria's government.

Damascus has accused Qatar and Saudi Arabia of arming rebels determined to topple Assad's government.

The United Nations has said more than 18,000 people have died and some 170,000 people have fled the country as a result of the fighting in Syria.

U.N. aid chief Valerie Amos has said that up to 2.5 million people in Syria needed aid.

'This conflict has taken on a particularly brutal and violent character,' Amos told a news conference in New York on Wednesday after visiting Syria and Lebanon last week.

'We face problems with access to people in need, particularly where there is intense and ongoing fighting, but funding is also holding us back. If we had more resources, we could reach more people,' she said.
