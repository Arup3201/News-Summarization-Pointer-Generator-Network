He may not be plying his trade in La Liga anymore, but Angel Di Maria is still making an impact in Spain's top flight.

The 26-year-old has ended with the second most assists in La Liga for the calendar year - despite now playing for Manchester United.

Di Maria registered 14 assists while at former club Real Madrid, between January and May; a figure that has only been one bettered by Barcelona's Lionel Messi for the whole of 2014.

The Argentina international's domestic figures are even more remarkable when you consider they outweigh Real superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (13), 

Ronaldo sits joint-third on the list with Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke - whose assists helped Diego Simeone's side win their league title since 1996.

Athletic Bilbao star Markel Susaeta completes the top five  with 12 as they secured Champions League football for this campaign.

As well as starring domestically, Di Maria was equally impressive for the Real in Europe last season, as he helped play an integral role in Carlo Ancelotti's side Champions League title triumph.

Despite his success at the Santiago Bernabeu, Di Maria subsequently joined United for a British club record £60million fee this summer.

Since moving to Old Trafford, the 26-year-old has provided six Premier League assists for the Red Devils while scoring three goals for Louis van Gaal's outfit.
