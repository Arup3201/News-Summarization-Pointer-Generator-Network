A crackdown on ‘absurd’ human rights rulings which threaten to hamper British troops carrying out vital missions was last night signalled by the Defence Secretary.

Michael Fallon said he was ‘appalled’ that legal challenges over incidents that happened in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost the taxpayer £85million – money which could have been spent on new kit.

The Government is determined to introduce laws restricting a string of court judgements which decree that the European Convention on Human Rights applies on the battlefield.

Mr Fallon said the prospect of health and safety-style laws applying to the war zone could seriously impact on Britain’s military capability.

Ministers fear the situation has become so farcical that troops will in future have to telephone a lawyer before taking action - even when they are in the heat of battle.

The Defence Secretary even raised the extraordinary possibility of platoons taking their own legal advisers on patrol.

A series of court rulings in both Britain and Europe have extended the reach of human rights laws over military actions and, critics say, opened the door for a raft of civil claims against the Government.

Last year, the families of some British soldiers killed or injured fighting in Iraq were given the go-ahead to bring compensation claims against the Government.

The Supreme Court ruled that cases of troops killed while driving poorly-protected Snatch Land Rovers could be brought under the ‘right to life’ enshrined in article two of the ECHR, potentially outlawing the future deployment of troops with outdated equipment.

New figures from the Ministry of Defence reveal the overall cost of legal challenges against the Ministry of Defence have topped £85million for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Millions of pounds have been paid out in compensation to suspected enemy fighters killed or detained on the battlefield.

Asked at the Tory conference about rulings that the ECHR should apply on the battlefield, Mr Fallon said: ‘I’m appalled. It’s not just being used, it’s being abused.

‘We already have military law and we already have international humanitarian law, we certainly do not need European law in this area hamstringing the efforts of our armed forces in very dangerous situations, the efforts that they make to keep people safe, to detain suspected terrorists and so on.

‘What I’m appalled about was to find that the MoD has already spent some £85million of taxpayers’ money, not on the armed forces, on new kit or equipment, but on London lawyers who are bringing forward these fairly spurious cases. That seems to me very wrong.’

He said Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling was considering bringing forward legislation which restricted the application of European laws on military operations.

Mr Fallon added: ‘Otherwise, we’ll end up with every platoon taking a legal adviser out on patrol and that quite simply unacceptable.’
