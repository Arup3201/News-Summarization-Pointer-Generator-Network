We all know restaurant staff are overworked, but one man has taken things to a new level.

A Chinese video shows a man 'washing up' almost 50 plates in ten seconds - and not smashing a single one.

The plates almost combine into a blur as they fly out of the mystery man's hands, landing in a bowl full of water apparently unmarked.

Fastest dishwasher in the East: The man with his stack of 50 dishes which need washing

Too many plates, too little time: He whisks through the pile, sending plates flying which remain intact

Many of the 100,000 people who have watched him on Youtube questioned how he could possibly do a thorough job in such little time.

One, Chrismario880, wrote: 'He just threw the plates into the water but there was not washing in the video at all!'

AllMightyMaze added: 'I can also throw 100 plates into some water. Where's the trick? As if they are clean.'

The video's origin is unknown - but its so-far anonymous star has been dubbed the 'Usain Bolt of dishwashing'.

Twitter users have already asked if he can be hired for Christmas or Thanksgiving.

Mystery: So far the man's identity is unknown - but he would come in very useful after a Christmas dinner
