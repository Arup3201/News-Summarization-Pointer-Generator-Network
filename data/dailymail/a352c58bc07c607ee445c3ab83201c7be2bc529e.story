Digging deep: Britain's charity was revealed at a time when the Government are introducing austerity measures at home

Britain has been rated the world’s fifth most charitable country.

It moved up from eighth place last year in a study of 153 nations carried out by the Charities Aid Foundation.

The U.S. came top of the World Giving Index 2011 – which ranks nations based on how likely citizens are to donate money, volunteer their time and help strangers – followed by Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.

The Netherlands was sixth, with the top ten completed by  Canada, Sri Lanka, Thailand  and Laos.

Despite the squeeze on income, 79 per
cent of Britons give money to charity each month, up from 73 per cent 
in 2010, according to the research.

This is at a time when the Government
has controversially vowed to maintain levels of overseas aid despite 
austerity measures at home.

The survey found that only Thais were more generous than Britons, with 85 per cent likely to make a regular charitable donation. Ireland and the Netherlands were jointly third on 75 per cent.

Some 28 per cent of the UK population volunteer time each month (down from 29 per cent last year) and 63 per cent help a stranger (up from 58 per cent).

Worldwide there was a 2 per cent increase in people helping strangers and a 1 per cent increase in volunteering over the past 12 months, but a 1 per cent drop in giving to charity, the study based on Gallup polling data discovered.

John Low, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation,  said: ‘It is amazing that during these tough economic times an overwhelming majority of the UK population gives to charity.

‘It shows just how deep-seated the idea of charity and charitable giving is in our society.

'However, there is always more that can be done. Creating an even stronger culture of giving in the UK will require ongoing commitment and effort by Government, business and charities.'
