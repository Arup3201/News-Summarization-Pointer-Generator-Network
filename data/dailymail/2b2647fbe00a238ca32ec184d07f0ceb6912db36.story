Arsenal are set to miss out on the signing of Kostas Manolas with the Greece international set to join Roma.

Italian paper Corriere dello Sport  claims the 23-year-old centre-back arrived in Rome's Fiumincino airport from Athens on Tuesday morning and will undergo a medical later in the day.

Roma have reportedly agreed with Olympiacos a £10.4million transfer fee for the highly-rated defender, who still has two years left in his contract with the Greek giants.

Manolas, who played four games at the World Cup for Greece this summer, attracted the attention of top European clubs, including Arsenal, following a solid 2013-14 campaign with Olympiacos.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger wants to sign a new defender before the transfer deadline following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona.

The Gunners’ need for defensive cover has heightened following a hamstring injury to Kieran Gibbs that will rule him out for the next three weeks.

Manolas made 25 league appearances last season and scored three goals while he also featured in seven Champions League games for the Piraeus-based club.
