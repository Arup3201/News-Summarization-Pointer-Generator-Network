A woman has spent almost £20,000 in a bid to look like her heroine, reality TV star Kim Kardashian.

Undergoing a vast array of cosmetic procedures and even wearing pants enhanced with silicone to replicated Kim’s famous derriere, Claire Leeson said she transformed her life after watching Keeping Up With the Kardashians in 2009.

Speaking with Ruth Langsford and Ben Shephard on ITV's This Morning, Claire, 24, from Chelmsford, Essex, said: ‘When I left school, friends would tell me that I had a resemblance to Kim.

Despite family concerns and debts, Claire says she will continue trying to look more like the reality TV star

Claire said her quest to look like Kim, right, started after watching Keeping Up With The Kardashians

‘So I watched [the show] and realised I had the same amount of siblings and that we have the same kind of arguments and things going on.

'I thought she was so beautiful and I really wanted to be like her.’

Claire, who spends £4,500 on her hair extensions alone, says the drastic steps she has taken to appear more like the Kim, 33, are an attempt to gain self-confidence after being severely bullied in her childhood.

Claire confessed: ‘I've had my teeth whitened, then I wanted my boobs enhanced... and with pictures [of Kim] explained to my surgeon that I wanted to look like this.

‘I also wear bum padding - it's a silicone base. Pants with silicone inside.

‘They feel very real... and hopefully will end up having that done because my bum is never going to be as big as Kim's is.’

Claire, who wears silicone pants, hopes to soon be able to have her buttocks enhanced through implants

She added, ‘I look at Kim so much and would love to be exactly like her because sometimes I feel like I'm not fully confident all the time within myself. My family are really worried, but they are so used to it now, but I know that I want to be happy.

‘In one way, I feel like I'm living in a fantasy and in a dream world. But it's real enough for me.

‘I was badly, badly bullied over my looks and it took me ten years to realise that I wasn't unattractive. I was so badly bullied that I didn't want to be alive anymore.'

Claire was humiliated by bullies who called her fat and ugly for three years between the ages of 13 and 16.

After a bully told her that she was too ugly to live and threw paracetamol at her in class, Claire said had had enough. At the age of just 14, she made her first suicide attempt.

A year later, Claire attempted suicide again, this time by overdosing on paracetamol while at a friend's house.

She was rushed to hospital and luckily paramedics were able to save her.

But there was no going back to school this time.

Despite managing to sit one of her GCSE exams, drama for which she received an A, she dropped out before finishing them.

Instead, Claire chose to pursue her studies at a local college before moving away from Chelmsford at the age of 19.

‘My life was hell and I was told every day that I was the ugliest thing alive and that I should kill myself.

'People do not realise what a damaging effect it has on your mental state for the rest of your life.’

Claire's obsession has even resulted in her getting into debt, as the expensive procedures to look like Kim Kardashian mount up.

Revealing how she pays for the upkeep to look like her idol, Claire admitted: ‘I do work but the job I do doesn't pay as much... so it's credit cards and debts up to my eyeballs.

‘I've had [bailiff] letters, but I just ignore them and I say to myself that I will pay them - but as soon as money comes in I just think about getting my Kimmy on! And I'll buy the new hair, make up or whatever...’

Claire added: ‘At the moment, I feel like what I'm doing might not be right but I feel it’s what is best for me for the time being because when I get my Kimmy on I feel like I'm unstoppable and untouchable and I feel like no one can stop me and I can make something of myself.

'I feel strong... and I feel that I have built enough confidence to love myself a little bit more.’
