One thirsty feline can't get enough of his spray bottle in a new video.

YouTube user Hilary D uploaded a video of her cat Joey on Thursday, titled 'Joey Runs For His Water Bottle.'

In the video, Joey is seen running down a flight of stairs and meowing loudly as a woman repeatedly shakes a spray bottle.

Siren call: Joey comes running when he hears the noise of his spray bottle

Pounce! Joey jumps to get closer to the bottle

Joey moves toward the woman and hops up on a nearby table to lap up some water.

The thirsty cat is seen wrapping his paws around the bottle, as the water is sprayed into his mouth.

'My cat Joey loves drinking water from his bottle,' Hilary D wrote on YouTube. 'He can be completely asleep but the moment you shake it, he's awake and running to you.'

In that video's description, Hilary D wrote that Joey does not suffer from a medical condition.

'I give him fresh water in a big bowl every day - this is just his favorite way to drink it!' she added.

This isn't the first video which shows Joey drinking water from a spray bottle.

Hilary D uploaded a video on March 2 which showed him drinking from a bottle - as well as from a pitcher, a faucet, an even from the shower.

'He's been drinking water this way since he was a kitten,' she wrote at the time. 'When he was a kitten he didn't want to drink from his bowl, so out of desperation I tried to "bottle" feed him with his spray bottle and he loved it!'Â
