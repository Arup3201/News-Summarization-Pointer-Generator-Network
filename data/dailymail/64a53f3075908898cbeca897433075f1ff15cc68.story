More than 200 holidaymakers have launched legal action against Butlins after they claim undercooked food and filth swimming pools left them violently ill.

The families say they were left with severe sickness, stomach cramps and diarrhoea after days at the holiday park in Bognor Regis, Sussex.

Many claim they were served undercooked meals, that hot food was mixed with existing food trays, and that it was constantly surrounded by flies and pigeons.

They also claim the water in the pool was dirty and cloudy, and that there was slime building up around the edge of the swimming area.

Families said as a result of their illness, they were told to leave early, while others say they were completely ignored by staff members.

Alison Hill, 55, a group leader of Mencap Hillingdon North, visited the site for five days in June 2011 with seven other volunteers and the group’s 21 members.

The carer, from Middlesex, said: 'When one of our group members became ill I complained to the resort staff, but was then seen privately by a manager who asked me not to tell other guests about the illness and also asked if the party could leave early.

'We were stunned.

'Having to return earlier than planned caused major disruption, as day-to-day carers for some of our members were on holiday themselves and did not expect us to be returning early.

'Over two years on, we have still not been on another overnight visit as a group simply because we all do not want to go through the emotional and physical distress again.

Families have since launched legal action after they claim they were left with severe sickness, stomach cramps and diarrhoea after just days at the centre in 2011

'It is really worrying that other people have also suffered illness since our time there.

'We know all too well how falling ill can ruin your holiday.'

Amy Denny, 24, from Northampton, had booked a break at the resort with her partner Philip and sons Bailey and Finley, but was forced to return early.

The healthcare assistant said: 'My youngest son Bailey was only 18 months at the time and we had to take him to hospital as we were so scared about the effect that the illness had on him.

'It is so upsetting that it was our first holiday together as a family and it has scarred them for life.'

They
 have now instructed law firm Irwin Mitchell to start court proceedings 
after Butlins' parent company Bourne Leisure Ltd denied any liability 
for the outbreak between May and July 2011.

Elizabeth Tetzner, of Irwin Mitchell, said: 'Our clients have given us worrying accounts of their stays, including concerns regarding cleanliness, standards of food preparation and service as well as their treatment by staff at the site.

'Bourne Leisure Ltd has denied liability and as such our clients have been left with no other option than to issue court proceedings as they seek justice for their ruined holidays.

'Unless an out of court settlement can be achieved on satisfactory terms, these clients’ claims will be determined at trial in court.

'Gastric illness can have a devastating impact on people’s health and the effects of it cannot be underestimated.

'We have acted in numerous cases where our clients have been left with long term health problems.'

A spokesman for Butlin’s at Bognor Regis said: 'We will robustly defend this speculative action raised at the High Court in Birmingham.

'We operate our resorts to the highest health and safety standards and work closely with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure that our guests’ safety takes priority.

'Our standards of cleanliness and hygiene are recognised throughout the tourist industry world-wide. Such is our reputation on health issues that environmental officers from around the UK have described our policies and procedure as outstanding.'
