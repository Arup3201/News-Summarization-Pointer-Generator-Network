The Met Office’s ‘pitiful’ forecasts were under fire last night after it was revealed it told councils in November to expect ‘drier than usual’ conditions this winter.

In the worst weather prediction since Michael Fish reassured the nation in October 1987 that there was no hurricane on the way, forecasters said a large area of the country which includes the Somerset Levels – still under water after more than two months of flooding – would most likely see rainfall levels well below average.

Last night, it was confirmed the UK had instead suffered the wettest winter since records began.

The Met Office told councils in November to expect 'drier than usual' conditions despite it being the wettest winter on record

The three-month forecast, which a Met Office spokesman conceded was ‘experimental to some extent’, was given to councils, the Environment Agency and other contingency planners to tell them what they could expect from December to the end of this month.

It was for the whole of the UK – not specific regions – but suggested only the east and south east might see average rainfall.

The forecasters – using ‘cutting-edge science’ – assured councils there would be a ‘significant reduction in precipitation compared to average’ for most of the country, adding that there was only a 15 per cent chance the winter would fall into the ‘wettest category’.

It will have been of little assistance to the many local authorities facing some of the most severe flooding Britain has seen in decades.

Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris said the Met Office's track record is pitiful

Swathes of the country are still 
underwater, the Army is still helping to pump out deluged homes and 
thousands of people have nowhere to live. 

Last night it was confirmed that the past 90 days have seen the heaviest rainfall in more than a century.

The Met Office said the UK had been drenched in 19.2in of rain since December, making it the wettest winter since records began in 1910.

It had, it said, been exceptionally wet in the South West, South East, central Southern England and across Wales.

MPs and environmental planners yesterday said the long-term forecast had been a ‘mistake which could have cost Britain dearly’ and questioned whether the forecasting methods were fit for purpose.

Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris said: ‘The Met Office is very good at predicting the weather it can see is coming; but beyond that, its track record is pitiful.

‘Many government agencies and some government policies are dependent on these Met Office predictions and so these mistakes potentially are costing us dearly.’ 

Environmental planner Martin Parr said of the forecast: ‘It was a load of poppycock. I don’t know how they could have produced it and circulated it to emergency planners.

There was no way that was going to be the case.

‘It was known in November there were changes in the jet stream coming through. It was speeding up, there was more oscillation, that means strong winds were going to be prevalent, and it was going to be a wet winter.

Dredging is finally to restart on the Somerset Levels next month.

Flood victims whose homes and farms have been under water since Christmas have laid the blame squarely at the door of the Environment Agency, which stopped regular dredging in 1995.

Now, after pressure from the Prime Minister, officials will clear five-mile stretches of two rivers as soon as it is safe to do so.

Floods minister Dan Rogerson said: ‘Today marks a crucial step forwards in ensuring local communities around the Somerset Levels are better protected.’

‘These forecasts affect decisions the authorities take, having the correct

The
 Met Office stopped publishing its long-range forecasts for the public 
to see in 2010, after its disastrous prediction of a ‘barbeque summer’ 
in 2009 – which ended in washouts throughout July and August.

The three-month forecasts are now sent only to contingency planners, such as councils,  government departments, and insurance companies.

The 90-day forecast was issued at the end of November, and makes clear planners should also consult the forecasts released 30 and 15 days ahead which are more accurate.

Using the Met Office’s super-computer, which can perform 100trillion calculations a second, experts in November predicted there would be high-pressure weather systems across Britain ‘with a slight signal for below average precipitation’.

But heavy rains began in December and the Somerset Levels has since seen some of its worst flooding ever, with hundreds of properties and farms affected. 

Last month the flooding spread to the Thames Valley and official figures suggest 6,500 properties have been affected.

Insurance companies fear the total bill could reach £1billion.

A spokesman for the Met Office said: ‘Our short and medium-term forecasts are the ones relied on by emergency responders to help them manage the impacts of severe weather.

'The Met Office’s five-day forecasts and severe weather warnings have provided excellent guidance throughout this period of exceptionally stormy and wet weather.’

In response to this article, the Met Office points out that long-term forecasts are experimental and its five day severe weather warnings this winter proved invaluable to the public and emergency services.
