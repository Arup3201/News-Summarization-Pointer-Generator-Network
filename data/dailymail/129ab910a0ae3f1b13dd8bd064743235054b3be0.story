Putin's signing of the bill has angered Americans and Russians who argue it victimises children

President Vladimir Putin has signed a bill banning Americans from adopting Russian children, less than 24 hours after his office received it from Parliament.

The bill has angered Americans and Russians who argue it victimises children to make a political point, cutting off a route out of frequently dismal orphanages for thousands of children.

The measure is retaliation for an 
American law that calls for sanctions against Russian officials deemed 
human rights violators, after Russia imprisoned lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who later died, after uncovering a Â£143million fraud.

The signing comes hours after a Moscow court acquitted the only official charged with his death.

The Russian-language hashtag 'PutinEatsKids' was trending on Twitter just minutes after Putin signed it.

Unicef estimates that there are about 740,000 children not in parental custody in Russia while about 18,000 Russians are on the waiting list to adopt a child.

The law also blocks dozens of Russian children now being adopted by American families from leaving the country.

The US is the biggest destination for adopted Russian children - more than 60,000 of them have been taken in by Americans over the past two decades.

The 
U.S. State Department says it regrets the Russian Parliament's decision 
to pass the bill, saying it would prevent many children from growing up 
in families.

Amnesty International Europe and 
Central Asia director John Dalhuisen said: 'This bill is frankly a 
childish response to the Magnitsky Act.

'The Duma should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen Russian civil society, not weaken it.'

Putin said the U.S. Act had 'poisoned relations' between the two countries

Children's rights ombudsman Pavel Astakhov says that 46 children who were about to be adopted in the US would remain in Russia if the bill comes into effect.

Mr Putin has said that US authorities routinely let Americans suspected of violence toward Russian adoptees go unpunished.

The passage of the bill followed weeks of a hysterical media campaign on Kremlin-controlled television that lambasts American adoptive parents and adoption agencies that allegedly bribe their way into getting Russian children.

A few MPs claimed that some Russian children were adopted by Americans only to be used for organ transplants and become sex toys or cannon fodder for the US Army.

A spokesman with Russia's dominant Orthodox Church said that the children adopted by foreigners and raised outside the church will not 'enter God's kingdom.'
