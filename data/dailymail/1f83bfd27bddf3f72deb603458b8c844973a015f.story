Elegantly dressed, dripping with jewels and stunningly beautiful, India's pantheon of goddesses holds a special place in the heart of the country's Hindu majority.

But one ad agency has turned the concept upside down by unveiling a hard-hitting campaign that depicts Lakshmi, Durga and Saraswati as the victims of domestic abuse.

Described by commentators, including the team at Scoopwhoop.com, as something that 'needs to be taken more seriously', the shocking images are intended to highlight the plight of India's most vulnerable women, including victims of human trafficking.

Appalling: This striking image depicts Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, as a battered domestic violence victim

The text accompanying the shocking images reads: 'Pray that we never see this day. Today, more than 68 per cent of women in India are victims of domestic violence. Tomorrow, it seems like no woman shall be spared. Not even the ones we pray to.'

Although the horrific gang rape and murder of student Jyoti Singh last December caused outrage across the world and intensified Indian government efforts to get to grips with endemic domestic violence, little is known about human trafficking.

According to Save the Children India, which commissioned the images to promote its Save Our Sisters anti-trafficking initiative, trafficking of young girls and women for sexual exploitation is all too common.

Along with campaigning, the charity hopes to tackle the problem through its Sahas Kendra Livelihood Programme, which helps victims of trafficking to overcome their experiences through counselling while also providing them with education and life skills needed to keep them off the streets.

Ironic: Durga, the goddess of good triumphing over evil, sports a black eye and a bloody lip in this image

Horrifying: Saraswati, goddess of knowledge and arts, also features alongside wealth goddess Lakshmi

Other initiatives include workshops set up to employ trafficking victims and give them a new future in the garment industry - two of which are supported by Beulah London founder Lady Natasha Rufus-Isaacs who has seen the plight of India's exploited women and girls first hand.

'Both Lavinia [Brennan] and I witnessed the effects of human trafficking in India 2010 when we worked in local slum schools, and at an aftercare home with trafficked girls,' she reveals.

'It opened our eyes to this horrific crime, and we were shocked at that this sort of modern-day slavery still goes on.

'It's one of the largest crimes in our society today - more so than trafficking drugs. Drugs can be sold once but human beings can be sold over and over again, it is an extremely lucrative market.'

Beulah works with anti-trafficking organisations Freeset and Open Hand in Delhi and Calcutta, which produce canvas bags and some garments for the label.

Rufus-Isaacs added: 'We launched Beulah London in 2011 to help provide a sustainable livelihood to those that have come out of sex trafficking.

'The name Beulah represents the journey of woman coming out of despair into a new life of hope and restoration.

'We fully support the Abused Goddesses campaign, and its aim to raise awareness of human trafficking.

'The imagery is powerful and moving, and we hope it will help prevent and protect many women from being trafficked in the future.'
