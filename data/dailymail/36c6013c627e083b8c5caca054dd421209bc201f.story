This is the dramatic moment a group of fishermen were rescued from freezing waters seconds before their boat sank.

Five of the crew from Irish vessel, the Iuda Naofa, can be seen scrambling on the upturned stern of the boat after it got into trouble about 48 miles north of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland on Monday.

Large waves crashed into the sinking ship, sending four of the stranded crew into the sea, as the last fisherman managed to escape just moments before it completely submerged.

Footage captured by the Scottish Coastguard shows the dramatic moment the five crew members were rescued as their ship sank below them

The Scottish Coastguard sent a rescue helicopter to the scene after they had tried to use a salvage pump to clear water from the boat - but it was soon swamped and started to sink.

A winch line had been connected between the helicopter and the boat but it had to be released as the vessel went down to prevent the helicopter being pulled down with it.

Two men got to another nearby vessel, the Star of Hope, in a rescue raft while the other three men were airlifted to the Western Isles hospital, where they were treated for mild hypothermia. 

It took just 35 seconds for the boat to go under - where is now lies at the at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. 

Deckhand, Micheál Ó Conghaíle, was on board with his father when they started to get into trouble and has told of how he clung to the 63-year-old as they waited to be rescued.

'We started fishing about 8pm Monday night about 30 miles Northwest of [North] Rona,' explained the 32-year-old from Inis Mor, Galway.

'After we took the fish aboard we were taking in water. It's not unusual for wooden fishing boats.

'We were minding the pumps but the water got the better of the pumps in the end. We could see we couldn't win the battle so we called the coastguard.'

After lowering another pump the coastguard decided it was time to winch the crew to safely and told them gather at the stern.

Mr Ó Conghaíle continued: 'The coastguard said from the moment all five of us were on the stern it took just 35 seconds to go down.

'She went over. I heard a pop of the life raft coming up and two of the crew climbed on.

'She didn't hit me - I knew I wasn't caught but I was in the water and there was a bit of rope tangled. I pulled that off. I was frightened she might pull me down with her.

'When I was in the water and holding onto dad I saw a seagull eating a fish. He was picking at something and I was looking at him thinking "This is just a normal day for you".'

Deckhand Micheál Ó Conghaíle has described how he clung to his 63-year-old father Mairtín in the freezing cold waters as they waited to be rescued

Mr Ó Conghaíle, father Mairtín, 63, and another deckhand were winched onto the helicopter one by one.

They were taken to Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis and treated for mild hypothermia and cared for by the Stornoway Fishermen's Mission. 

Praising the efforts of the Coastguard Mr Ó Conghaíle said: 'We are eternally grateful for them rescuing us. The Fishermen's Mission were amazing. They couldn't do enough for us.'

The terrifying experience has not put him off fishing and he added that he will return to the sea when the weather conditions improve.

Earlier this month, eight crew were lost when a Cypriot-registered ship sunk off the north of Scotland.

The Cemfjord, a cement carrier, capsized in stormy conditions on January 2 while attempting to make its way through the Pentland Firth.

No trace of the seven Polish nationals and one Filipino on board the vessel has been found despite searches.

A church service was held in their memory in Wick, Caithness, at the weekend with candles lit for each of the crew members and their families.
