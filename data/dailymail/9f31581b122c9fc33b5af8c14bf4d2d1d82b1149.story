Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard believes that three points against Arsenal on Sunday could be the catalyst for change at Anfield.

Brendan Rodgers' side have stuttered through the first half of this season, and sit 11th in the Premier League after 16 games. Gerrard, though, is confident that a win against fellow strugglers Arsenal could kick-start their season.

'We are a strong dressing room with a good manager - it will only be a matter of time before we turn it around,' he told the club's website. 'I've got confidence it will happen - and hopefully it will start with a victory over Arsenal because that could really kick-start things for us.

Brendan Rodgers has come under fire and needs a win on Sunday to take the Reds into the top half

'We're still moving forward, I really believe that. I'm the first to admit it's been tough this season, it's been a bit of a roller-coaster. We aren't where we want to be in the table and nobody is happy about that. 

'But we're determined to put it right. It will take time. But I have that belief that we'll get it right and we will get there. If we can come through a big game against Arsenal and get a win then that could be the catalyst for us to go on a run of results.'

When the two sides met at Anfield last season, Liverpool put five past Arsene Wenger's side, and three points this term can move them into the top half for Christmas.

The intensity of Liverpool's play resulted in Rodgers' side leading 4-0 after just 20 minutes at Anfield 

Arsenal, last time around, were top of the tree, but this season sit 7th, just five points above Sunday's opposition. 

Off the back of a 3-0 loss to Manchester United, Liverpool are without striker Mario Balotelli, who is serving a one-game ban imposed by the FA for breaking rules on social media. 

Arsenal's Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (both groin) and Nacho Monreal (ankle) face fitness tests to determine if they can play in Sunday's crunch clash.
