Husbands will have to have a difficult conversation with their wives about accessing porn at home, David Cameron said today.

The Prime Minister warned that new opt-in filters will mean that couples will have to decide between them if their internet access can be used to view pornography.

But he signalled that he thought families with children should opt to block access to adult material.

Summit: David Cameron today held talks in Downing Street with members of leading search engines, internet service providers, the National Crime Agency and the NSPCC

Mr Cameron today hosted a summit in Downing Street with search engine giants, internet service providers, charities and the National Crime Agency to tackle the spread of child abuse images online.

Internet search results linked to child abuse are to be blocked across the world in a stunning U-turn by Google.

The world's biggest media firm has agreed to introduce changes which will prevent depraved images and videos from appearing for more than 100,000 different searches.

Intelligence experts at GCHQ have also been drafted in to break the ‘dark web’ which allows paedophiles to share vile images online.

By the end of next year the biggest internet providers will require 20 million homes – 95 per cent of all properties with an existing internet connection – to choose whether to switch on a ‘family friendly internet filter’.

Filters have already been switched on by the six largest public Wi-Fi providers across Britain and hundreds of thousands of homes have already been opted in.

Also attending the summit with David Cameron were Gavin Patterson from BT and Dido Harding from Talk Talk

Britain’s spy agencies have been ordered to break up the ‘dark web’ used by paedophiles to share sick child abuse images online.

Prime
 Minister David Cameron said he wanted GCHQ to do more to find those 
trying to ‘hide from justice’ by using encrypted internet networks.

It
 comes ahead of a Downing Street summit where web firm Google  will 
pledge to block internet search results linked to child abuse around the
 world.

Mr Cameron has made clear that he 
wants more to be done to protect internet users from vile images online 
while trying to catch those responsible for the abuse.

He
 has tasked GCHQ intelligence experts to try to track those using secret
 links – known as the ‘dark web’ - to share photographs of child abuse.

The
 National Crime Agency estimates that the number of people in the UK 
using encrypted networks has risen by two-thirds and is expected to hit 
20,000-a-day by the end of this year.

Some
 people could be using them legally, but police and intelligence 
agencies believe paedophiles use such networks to distribute child abuse
 material.

But today Mr Cameron was challenged over how couples will agree over web access, if a husband wants the filters switched off and a wife wants to block pornography.

The PM said: ‘Well, they’re going to have to have a discussion, aren’t they?

‘The fact is, I think what ought to happen here and what is going to happen now is when you sign up to an internet service provider, when you take out your broadband account, you are prompted with an online message which is there are these pornography filters that are switched on.

‘If you want to keep them, go ahead, particularly if you’ve got children in the house; if you want to take them off, you have to make an active choice. And I think that’s the right thing to do,’ he told BBC Radio 2.

‘Now, I had around the table with me Virgin Media, TalkTalk, BSkyB and BT, who between them account for almost nine out of ten broadband accounts in the country.

‘So I think this is real progress for people up and down the country, parents like me of three young children, who want to know that there are some limits on what your children can search for on the internet.’

In a major breakthrough, Google has agreed to changes to mark it more difficult to find child abuse images online.

The company's chairman Eric Schmidt, writing in today's Daily Mail ahead of a Downing Street summit on internet pornography, says: 'We've listened.'

He added: 'We've fine-tuned Google Search to prevent links to child sexual abuse material from appearing in our results.'

The restrictions, which have been designed to apply in English-speaking countries, will be expanded to cover the rest of the world and 158 other languages in the next six months.

Mr Schmidt also reveals that Google has developed breakthrough technology that will allow illegal videos to be 'tagged' so that all duplicate copies can be removed across the internet.
