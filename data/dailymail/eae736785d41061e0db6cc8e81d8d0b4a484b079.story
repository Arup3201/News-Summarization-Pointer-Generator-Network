Military fighter jets were called in to escort a passenger plane to Toronto airport after two women caused so much disruption that the Sunwing flight bound for Cuba was forced to turn back.

A spokesman for the airline claimed the passengers had consumed a 'significant quantity' of their duty-free alcohol - and also lit a cigarette in the toilet, triggering the smoke alarm.

It is also alleged the women, who were arrested when the plane landed, got into a fight with each other and 'made a threat against the aircraft'. 

Under threat: The pilot of the flight from Toronto to Cuba said the women were disruptive in a 'serious manner'

The pilot of the 737 aircraft, who described the passengers as being disorderly 'in a serious manner,' reported to NORAD (North American Aerospace Defence Command) while the plane was in US airspace that the aircraft was 'under threat'. 

Police officers were called to the airport around 8pm and the two passengers were arrested when the plane landed, said George Tudos with Peel Regional Police. 

'At 7.15pm we received a call that there was a Sunwing flight that was being diverted back to Pearson due to two female parties on board that were quite disruptive,' Tudos told CBC News.

'It was escorted by military planes back to Pearson, where it was met by our airport officers. 

'We are continuing the investigation to find out what happened and are speaking to witnesses who were on the flight. We take all situations seriously and we are going to make sure that plane is safe before it leaves the gate.'

Two CF-18 fighter jets  escorted the plane on its way back to Canada.

The women, who face charges of smoking on board and endangering safety on an aircraft, have been identified as 25-year-old Lilia Ratmanski from Whitby and 26-year-old Milana Muzikante from Vaughan.  

A spokesman for Sunwing said that the plane was diverted after a smoke alarm was triggered.

'It is reported that the passengers consumed a significant quantity of their duty-free alcohol purchase in the lavatory and lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke detector alarm,' she said.

'These passengers proceeded to get into a physical altercation with each other and made a threat against the aircraft, which was considered non-credible given their condition. 

'Our flight crew followed the appropriate procedures and the aircraft was diverted back to Toronto where it has now landed.'

'We are very apologetic for the inconvenience experienced by our customers and thankful to our flight crew for their efforts to safely manage the situation.' 

The flight was expected to take off again at around 11pm and customers will be provided with complimentary meal vouchers, a statement said.
