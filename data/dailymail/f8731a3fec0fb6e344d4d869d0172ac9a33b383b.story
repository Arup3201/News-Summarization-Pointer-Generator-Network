A cook shrunk by an impressive seven stone after she stopped tucking into her own homemade dishes and took to the treadmill.

Emma Jones tipped the scales at a dangerous 17st when she made the life-changing decision to stop tasting her own culinary delights, and slimmed down by six dress sizes in just five months.

The 42-year-old primary school cook couldn’t resist getting her fingers into the pupils’ pies and soon saw her size 14 frame reach new boundaries as she pulled on a pair of size 22 chef’s trousers.

After she made the life-changing decision to stop tasting her own culinary delights, and slimmed down by six dress sizes in just five months, Emma can now fit into a single leg of her old trousers

Emma, a mother of two, said: 'I cook for a living and I love making new dishes, but I enjoy my own food just a little too much.

'After I had my second child Charlie, three, I wasn’t thinking about what I was eating.

'I had a new baby and I wasn’t paying any attention to my weight and I wasn’t taking any care of myself. I just ballooned.'

Following Charlie’s birth, Emma also suffered from post-natal depression, which led her to comfort eat.

She said: 'I had some help for the depression and I started to feel better about life in general.

'My weight was starting to get me down and I knew I had to do something about it.'

Emma went to collect a prescription from her doctor, and saw her age written out in full on the form.

She said: 'It suddenly struck me that I was approaching 42. I just had to do something about the way I looked, as I was beginning to let myself go. It was scary.'

Emma says that since dropping the weight she feels fabulous - and now runs a marathon a year

Emma, who has been with her partner Ian for 10years, said: 'He knew I wasn’t happy with the way I looked.

'He has always taken me for who I am so I never felt pressure to lose weight for him, but I had to take control of my life.'

Emma, from Otley, West Yorks, always had an excellent relationship with food, and always ate fresh fruit and vegetables.

But, she found it difficult to stick to three meals a day and would snack heavily in between, as well as finishing off her children’s meals.

She said: 'One of the things I cook at the school is fresh bread. When it would come out of the oven, I just couldn’t resist gnawing away on it.

'It was bad habits like that that meant the weight just piled on.'

Joining Weight Watchers and controlling her diet through a points system meant the weight quickly fell from Emma, who quickly began to recognise her old self.

She said: 'I began to look at food in a completely different way and I changed my whole lifestyle.

'Taking into account how much I was eating in a portion showed how much I was eating before, and I turned to snacking on fruit as I could eat as much of it as I wanted.'

Emma also began to exercise to gain more Weight Watchers points, and this revolutionised the way she looked at being active.

'I realised I could eat more if I did some exercise, and that I would feel better for becoming fitter,' Emma added.

'I began running on a friend’s treadmill and then I took to the outdoors. I live in a rural area, which fields close-by so I had no excuse for not getting out there.

'It was really tough to begin with but I started by walking and then running for short distances, and I soon built my stamina up.

Emma credits joining Weight Watchers and ditching her own delicious dishes for her staggering transformation

'I have a chocolate Labrador Archie, who became my reluctant running partner, so the pair of us would run around the Yorkshire Dales together.'

Within a couple of months, Emma decided to set herself a goal and enter into a 10km race to test how her running had come on.

'I felt amazed by how far I had come on,' said Emma. 'Ian and my sons Charlie and Dan, 15, stood on the sidelines to cheer me on and I don’t think they could believe that they were seeing.'

Emma, who is now a size 10, and weighs just 10-stone, has turned her life around and enjoys wearing clothes that make her feel and look good.

She said: 'Gone are the days where I resigned myself to stretchy waistlines and sacks for t-shirts.

'I can now wear clothes that have shape and fit me well. It’s great being able to shop on the high street again for things that I like.'

Incredibly, Emma now runs a 10km race every month, and has now entered into two marathons and The Great North Run, which she is racing to raise money for NSPCC later this year.

Emma is hoping to raise £2,000, and has set up a sponsorship page at virginmoney.giving.emmajones43
