Newcastle boss Alan Pardew felt his team should have got more than a point after Saturday's Premier League goalless draw at Aston Villa.

The game was one of few real chances, with Magpies midfielder Remy Cabella sending one wide when he might have done better and Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan denying Daryl Janmaat and debutant Siem de Jong, and Pardew felt his side did enough to win.

'Yeah, I think so,' said the Magpies boss, who saw Mike Williamson sent off in the dying seconds having collected two yellow cards in quick succession.

Blunt: Pardew's side failed to create many good chances, but Pardew still thought they should have won

He continued on BT Sport 1: 'I thought we had really good control of the game - particularly in the second half. We absolutely dominated, but couldn't find the moment.

'When you get a lot of new offensive players, they're so keen to do well. You could almost see Remy (Cabella) trying too hard to force the moment. You can't really do that in football - you have to let the moment come to you.

'I'm pleased with the team. I think there's a good solid base to it. We know we need to threaten with goals and that will win us games. There were a lot of good signs again, but we haven't scored yet and that will be hanging on us.'

On whether he planned much transfer activity before the window closes on September 1, he commented: 'We've got our finger on the pulse, as we've shown all summer.

'Whether we can get another body in or even two before the window shuts, I don't know, but I think there will be some movement - maybe one or two going out as well. We'll see.'
