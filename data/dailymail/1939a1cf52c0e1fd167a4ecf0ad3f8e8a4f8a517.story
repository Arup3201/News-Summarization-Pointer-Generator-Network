Last year, two-fifths of GCSE pupils in England failed to achieve five passes, including English and maths, at grade C or above

A third of teenagers getting poor GCSE results have already resigned themselves to a life on benefits, a study says.

It found that school leavers with low grades believe they will ‘never amount to anything’.

Even 20 per cent of those who have done well fear they will have to live off the state.

Youth unemployment stands at almost one million and yesterday the Government revealed how single people will have their benefits capped. 

A quarter of 16 to 25-year-olds surveyed by The Prince’s Trust said their results would ‘always’ hold them back.

And one in five of the 2,300 polled by the youth charity claimed to have ‘abandoned their ambitions’ because of poor grades. 

Last year, two-fifths of GCSE pupils in England failed to achieve five passes, including English and maths, at grade C or above.

The trust’s chief executive Martina Milburn said youngsters were ‘buckling under extreme pressure’ of the tough job market.

She added: ‘Those who have struggled at school fear they will end up on the dole, unable to compete in a flooded labour market. 

‘Thousands of young people’s ambitions are crushed by exam results each year. 

‘Many of them have faced problems at home or bullying at school, so their exam results don’t reflect their full potential.

‘It is now more important than ever to invest in vocational support and training for young people who are not academically successful. 

‘Government, employers and charities must work together to get them into jobs.’

With youth employment at alomst one million, one in five of the 2,300 polled by The Princes' Trust said they 'abandoned their ambitions' because of poor grades
