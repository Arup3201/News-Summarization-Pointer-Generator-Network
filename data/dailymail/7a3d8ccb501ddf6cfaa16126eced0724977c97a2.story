When it comes to 'corporate firefighting' and 'pan-functional team-building', there's only one man for the job - Ian Fletcher, Hugh Bonneville's hilariously incompetent Head of Deliverance in the Olympics comedy Twenty Twelve.

And now he's back in a brand new sitcom that will have us falling about with laughter again, even if we haven't got a clue what he's on about.

This time, in W1A, he has the bigwigs at Broadcasting House in his sights - or as Hugh puts it, he aims to 'clarify, define, or re-define the core purpose of the BBC across all its functions'.

Twenty Twelve, which ran for two series and won a Best Sitcom BAFTA, was a runaway success, sending up the London 2012 Games and the managerial chaos behind them.

The show launched to tiny audiences on BBC4 and quickly became a word-of-mouth success, as the understated humour and all-too-believable characters caught on.

But after it transferred to BBC2, millions caught up with the running gags about jargon and managerial incompetence.

The big-name stars helped - not just Hugh, whose character was in charge of everything from publicity to traffic lights, but Olivia Colman, who played his long-suffering PA and ardent admirer Sally Owen. She was the only efficient person in the Olympic Deliverance HQ and all the work fell on her shoulders, but she was willing to do anything for her beloved boss.

Her performance won Olivia a BAFTA too, for Best Female Comedy Performance.

The show was never expected to have a sequel - 'The clue to that was in the name,' jokes writer and director John Morton.

But
 it won such acclaim that inevitably some of its central characters have
 found themselves in new careers... and where better than the BBC?

'I never expected there to be a sequel to Twenty Twelve, the clue is in the name'

John Morton

W1A's premise is simple. Swamped by bad headlines and desperate for the licence fee to be renewed, the governors of the BBC need someone to steady the ship. And of course, since the Olympics were such a success, they bring in Ian Fletcher - unaware of all the behind-the-scenes disasters he'd been embroiled in... or had caused.

With a wry smile, Hugh says that the BBC has been offered 'a lot of learning opportunities in recent years' - management-speak for the catalogue of crises that have engulfed the corporation.

'It was only a matter of time before the BBC reached out for a new Head of Values - and Ian was the man for the job,' says Hugh, who promises that his folding bicycle, the perfect symbol for his eco-friendly ethics and ridiculous image, will also make a comeback... even if his character still hasn't mastered the technique of folding it without severing a finger.

The first obstacle he encounters when he arrives at Broadcasting House is the BBC's new 'hot-desking' policy that allows anyone to work anywhere, meaning they must lug their laptops around with them too.

'In the first episode, I think the defining message is how to find a desk,' says Hugh.

The writer of Twenty Twelve, John Morton, said he never expected to create a sequel

'Because the wonderful, open-plan, hot-desking principle at the BBC, which really doesn't allow you to sit down for any longer than five minutes, keeps the corporation quite literally on its toes. Ian is very keen to get the message across that his office door is always open, the only downfall being that there is no office.'

John Morton, who created both Twenty Twelve and W1A, calls Hugh 'the funniest straight-man actor in Britain. He's consistently funny, even when he's not saying anything. My favourite moments are when another character is talking nonsense and the camera cuts to Hugh. Before he says a line, the comedy effect has been doubled by the expression on his face. The secret lies behind his eyes. Hugh brings a really elusive quality - he's able to give you access to what he must be thinking but not saying.'

With the BBC 'brand' set to be such a crucial worldwide asset, they also hire the jargon-spouting PR consultant who handled the Olympics publicity - Siobhan Sharpe (played by Jessica Hynes) who is Ian's biggest nightmare. It's a chance for the characters (who cordially loathe each other) to 're-meet and recalibrate their relationship', as Hugh puts it with a laugh.

Siobhan's greatest regret is that she isn't American. She doesn't do lunch, or relationships - they're both for wimps - and when she opens her mouth, verbiage tumbles out. 'If you get bandwidth on this, you've got maple syrup on your waffle at the get-go.'

And there are new characters, including a Head of Output with the power to veto any programme, played by Sarah Parish. Sarah's career has been in overdrive for the past year, including a starring role in the Saturday teatime blockbuster Atlantis; in W1A she gets to play a blustering bully called Anna.

'She's this high-powered, frightening, intimidating, very definite person,' explains Sarah. 'When she makes a decision, she makes it. Unfortunately it's always wrong! She's good at talking the talk. When Ian Fletcher arrives, Anna is quite defensive: she's suspicious of him, just in case he actually does know what he's talking about!'

Real-life BBC executives might be expected to feel more than a little anxious about a satire set in their own offices. But Morton insists the top brass have left the actors to get on with it, and that senior managers have not even asked to see a script, let alone demanded cuts or rewrites.

It might ruffle a few feathers, though, he warns. 'This is certainly no love letter to the BBC, but it is a gentle satire. It's benign... even if that's not fashionable.'

It's more than just a laugh at the BBC's expense, even though the title is a direct reference to the postcode of Broadcasting House in London, where the series was actually filmed. The cast hope that, as with Twenty Twelve, millions of viewers will spot the resemblance to their own working lives.

'Twenty Twelve was about satirising management structure and management speak,' says Hugh,

'and all the pitfalls of a team trying to do something en masse when all people are doing is passing the buck. The same flavour is there in W1A - we're not deriding the BBC but we are having an interesting look at the way some decisions are reached. This could quite easily have been set in the NHS or Whitehall.'

But the satire neatly skewers the BBC's addiction to jargon and meaningless titles, as executive producer Jon Plowman admits. 'I was asked 20 years ago to be Head of Broken Comedy, which meant non-narrative sketch shows. I said I didn't want to be head of anything broken, so a title had to be inventedÂ  - I was made Head of Comedy Entertainment, which then suggested comedy existed that wasn't entertainment.'

He took the precaution, before W1A started filming, of confirming with Tony Hall, the director-general, that there were no plans to appoint a real-life Head of Values, and was told the post would remain vacant... at least as long as W1A was on the air.

Jon's own title now is Executive Producer. As he defines it, 'The producer's the guy who does the day-to-day work; the executive producer is the guy who gets the credit.'

Viewers who missed Twenty Twelve should not expect a glib comedy packed with one-liners. The dialogue in W1A is stuttering: characters start to say something and get bogged down in their own incoherence.

'With comedy there are 100 ways to set up
 a situation, and 99 of them simply aren't funny. Finding the right one 
is the hardest work imaginable'

John Morton

Often they suddenly cut off in mid-sentence, aware that they shouldn't give voice to whatever they're thinking. It's subtle, and all too easy to relate to, with a twinge of embarrassment. But despite the stumbling and the mumbling, there's no improvisation by the cast in W1A - nor was there in Twenty Twelve. Every 'umm' and 'err' is scripted. That puts huge pressure on the actors, because in a scene with five or six people, it only takes one tiny error, one word a second too early, and they have to start again.

'The show might look like it happened to fall together,' Morton says, 'but getting it precisely right take after take is exhausting. And that process continues in the editing suite - comedy focuses on the tiniest of details. With drama you might tell a scene in ten different ways, but with comedy there are 100 ways to set up a situation, and 99 of them simply aren't funny. Finding the right one is the hardest work imaginable - and if it flops, everyone notices.'

The question every Twenty Twelve fan will be asking is what's happened to Ian's doting PA Sally (Olivia Colman).

Sadly, she isn't returning, though the writer does promise viewers will learn what happened between Sally and Ian on their fateful trip to Italy at the end of the last series.

But love, or perhaps a catastrophic office affair, is on the horizon for the BBC's new Head of Values. Whether his career can withstand it is an outcome that, as Ian might say, will be determined following the appraisal of the blue sky interpersonal reassessment session. In other words... wait and see. W1A will air on BBC2 later this month.
