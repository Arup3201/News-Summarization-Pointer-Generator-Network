David Reynolds (pictured) was found guilty at City of London Magistrates Court of assault by beating after he broke a bouncer's nose in a row over a £500 bar bill at a five-star hotel

A City analyst who broke a bouncer’s nose in a row over a £500 bar bill at a five-star hotel, while claiming he was related the Queen, is facing jail after being convicted of assault today.

David Reynolds, 31, punched Arza Daery after he was kicked out of the Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge following a three hour drinking session.

City of London Magistrates Court heard his credit card was declined on December 18th due to a malfunction on the machine.

Earlier, the court had heard how Reynolds launched into a foul-mouthed tirade against staff at the hotel then punching the bouncer.

Reynolds had claimed staff had 'grossly over-reacted' and that he 'absolutely did not' hit the bouncer.

However, he was convicted of one count of assault by beating by magistrates who found his drunken account less reliable than that of the two bouncers.

Giving evidence, Mr Reynolds said: 'We had drunk quite a lot, we drunk more than we probably should have.

'We asked for the bill and we wished to leave. There was a problem with the card machine.

'I thought they grossly over-reacted by calling security who were hovering in the background.

'The bar staff were quite inconsiderate given we had been guests at the hotel.

'I did use bad language outside which I apologise for.

'We were treated extremely badly given we had just gone there for a few drinks, which had been very enjoyable up until that point.

'I absolutely did not punch Mr Draey, I never have been in a fight in my life, I have never punched anyone - that is not who I am.

'I use words and the words I used that night were regrettable.'

Jonathan Swain, prosecuting, had earlier said: 'Mr Reynolds was very drunk and as a result, he was asked to leave by management.

'He was escorted from the premises by Mr Draey. While outside, there was an unprovoked assault by Mr Reynolds.

'He
punched Mr Draey in the face. There was no threat of violence by either
individual and as a result, a struggle ensued. He was held by two door 
staff until the police arrived.

'In essence the question is whether that violence was justified and the Crown says it was not.'

Reynolds
was taken to the pavement outside the hotel when the victim, who had 
his hands behind his back, started talking to him.

Giving evidence, Mr Draey told the court his injury was so severe that he had a 'black eye at Christmas'.

He added: 'I was called to the bar and found two gentlemen who were unable to pay for their drinks.

'I tried to communicate with them, but he [Reynolds] was not responding. When he did it was gibberish.

'We didn't want them in the bar because they were too drunk and had been abusive.

'When outside, I thought they were going to push some plant pots over as they were going towards them.

'I
was a couple of feet away and Reynolds kept coming back and forth 
calling the doormen names and calling me a c*** - all kinds of swear 
words.

'I work at a five star hotel, I don't really respond to that kind of abuse.

'I was completely passive and no threat to him whatsoever. He kept telling me I was going to regret it, calling me a c***. My hands were behind my back and then he hit me.

'It
was a punch, he punched me in the face in my nose with a closed fist. 
It was hard enough to break my nose - I got several fractures.

'As soon as he punched me me and my colleague grabbed him, I got blood all over him.

'I was on top of him and asked him 'would you like me to hit you?' He said yes, but I didn't hit him.

'I had to spend Christmas with a black eye, it got a lot worse. For months after when I blew my nose, blood was coming out.'

Reynolds' card was eventually accepted for the £500 bill, but he was so drunk that Mr Draey did not even think he was English.

The court heard how an inebriated Reynolds spat abuse at the bouncers and bizarrely claimed he was related to the Royal family.

Cleuber Martins, the second bouncer, said: 'The defendant was talking in French.

'He
was shouting some bad swear words, calling everyone a c***, claiming to
be related to the Royal family, saying we were all going to lose our 
jobs.

'He kept saying "you deserve it, you're all c***s, I'm related to the Queen".'

The investment analyst stared straight ahead as the verdict was read out.

Magistrate chair Mena Rego said: 'We have heard a great deal of alcohol was consumed by you a d your friends and this undoubtedly would have had a bearing on your account and behaviour.

'We gave greater weight to the account of the bouncers.

'You were taken to the ground by Mr Martins and restrained by Mr Draey who was on top of you.

'He suffered a punch on the nose caused by an unprovoked attack.'

Reynolds, of Highbury, north London, is due to be sentenced on October 4th.
