Arsene Wenger admits he was worried about his players being 'on the edge physically' before Mathieu Debuchy was sent off during Arsenal's 1-0 Champions League qualifier win against Besiktas.

Alexis Sanchez's first Gunners goal was enough to put his side into the Champions League group stages on Wednesday night, but it didn't go all Arsenal's way.

Arsenal had to finish the match with 10 men after Mathieu Debuchy was sent off for collecting a second yellow card when the Frenchman dragged Mustafa Pektemek to the ground with 15 minutes left to play.

Wenger said: 'I was very worried because you never know as we have some players on the edge physically.

'I thought it was very harsh because Debuchy played the ball and maybe with the anger from our side on the bench we saw he played the ball. The referee was on the other side.

The Arsenal boss also expressed his relief at Arsenal qualifying success as they now await Thursday afternoon's Champions League draw.

He added: ‘It is unthinkable until it happens then everyone thinks why it’s happened, but now it's a weight off our shoulders.’

Portugal’s Pedro Proenca is one of Europe’s most experienced referess but had a poor night. 

He missed two Besiktas penalties for fouls by Mathieu Debuchy and Jack Wilshere, then sent off Debuchy for an innocuous challenge which he deemed to be a second yellow. 

Proenca cautioned sub Calum Chambers for coming on without permission — technically correct but not in keeping with a referee of his standing.
