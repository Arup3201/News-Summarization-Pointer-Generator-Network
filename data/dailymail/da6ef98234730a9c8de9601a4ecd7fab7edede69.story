Unseen footage from the Channel 4 reality series Benefits Street could be played in court as one star of the show goes on trial accused of assaulting a police officer.

Lawyers for Charlene Wilson have asked Channel 4 to release the cut material to be played as part of her defence at a forthcoming hearing in Birmingham.

Wilson, 29, who has accused the documentary's producers of duping her into taking part, was arrested last summer for allegedly assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty.

Appearing at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court, Wilson was supported by other residents from James Turner Street in Winson Green including Samora 'Black Dee' Roberts and Deirdre 'White Dee' Kelly.

At one point the defendant during the brief hearing she turned to her friends and smiled as she sat in the dock.

One of the mother-of-three’s supporters in the public gallery was overheard to say 'ridiculous' as the trial was adjourned until April.

The hearing was put back because of the need for the film footage and a lack of time after an earlier trial had run for several hours, and because a police witness would not be available to appear while he was away on a course.

Wykeham Garsia, for the defence, told the court the material would need to be obtained from Channel 4 and played at the trial.

He said: 'We will need to play the film. I don’t think they would turn it around that quickly.

'In theory they should be able to reasonably speedily.

'They will obviously have it in their archives.

'I don’t know how long they keep films, I would imagine at least for a year or two.'

The hearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Friday was adjourned by the court clerk without the magistrates - who were deliberating a verdict in an earlier case - being present. Wilson was granted bail

Benefits Street star Fungi, who has gone into hiding since the explosive Channel 4 show first aired, fears he is dying.

The father-of-three - real name James Clarke - is a self-confessed alcoholic and recovering drug addict. He admitted turning to substance abuse after suffering years of abuse when he was a child.

The 44-year-old lived on James Turner Street in Winson Green, Birmingham, for four-and-a-half years before suffering a meltdown sparked by the stress of appearing on the programme.

Fears for his health grew when producers admitted he had moved away from the area 'for personal reasons.' But in a heart-breaking interview, he revealed he believes he does not have long to live.

'I haven’t got long left, I’m dying. I am waiting for my benefits to go up because of my health,' he said.

In a teaser for next week’s episode which aired on Monday night, 
producers showed Fungi visiting the doctors before saying he might have 
cancer.

Channel 4 was plunged into controversy last week after it emerged Fungi had fled his home on Benefits Street suffering a 'meltdown'.

Friends claimed that producers had bribed Fungi with beer to appear on the show - an allegation Channel 4 has strenuously denied.

Chris Coughlan, for the prosecution, 
told the court a lengthy adjournment was necessary because a police 
witness had to attend a course.

He
 said: 'One of my officers won’t be available because he has an 
extremely important course which lasts 11 weeks and has been booked for 
months and months.'

Mr Coughlan added: 'It’s part of his career. I’m in the court’s hands.'

The hearing on Friday was adjourned by the court clerk without the magistrates - who were deliberating a verdict in an earlier case - being present.

Wilson was granted unconditional bail ahead of the trial.

She has previously claimed she was duped into appearing on the show.

'They told me it was about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn’t show any of that,' she said.

'If they had said it was about benefits and making the street look bad I would not have taken part.

'They tricked us.'

A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'We have not received a request for footage in relation to this incident but if we do then appropriate procedure will be followed.'

In a separate case Wilson has been charged with conspiracy to supply a Class A drug, crack cocaine, conspiracy to supply a Class B drug, cannabis, and possession of diamorphine.

She was arrested last June along with Black Dee, 32, who faces charges of conspiracy to supply a Class A drug, conspiracy to supply a Class B drug, possession of a Class A drug and possession of ammunition for a firearm without a certificate.

They were among seven people held in police raids - all but one of whom live in the street.

The defendants will appear before Birmingham magistrates on February 6.
