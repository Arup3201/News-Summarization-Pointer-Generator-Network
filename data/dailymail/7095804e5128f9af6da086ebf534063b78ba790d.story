A series of stunning photographs capturing Nelson Mandela strength of character have been released.

The pictures were taken in 2011 as part of film-maker Adrian Steirn’s celebration of South Africa, entitled ‘21 Icons’.

The freedom fighter reduced the crew to tears with his stories and jokes, according to Steirn.

He told The Times: ‘At one point I looked up and everyone was just crying. If you’re a South African, you’re connected to Mandela. He represents the human spirit.’

But, Mr Mandela did try and keep everyone in good spirits by cracking jokes.

Steirn said that when he asked him if he could adjust the mirror, Mr Mandela replied ‘You can adjust the size of my face,’ causing the whole room to break down laughing.

The 95-year-old is in a critical condition after being admitted to hospital on June 8 with a lung infection.

South African President Jacob Zuma's office said that Mr Mandela is 'still in a critical condition in hospital but shows sustained improvement'.

During the visit, he told the anti-apartheid leader of the love and support of all South Africans that was displayed at the leader's 95th birthday celebrations on July 18.

The president also asked the nation to continue to keep Mr Mandela in its thoughts and prayers. 

Mr Mandela was jailed for 27 years in 1963 for his action against apartheid.

He has said that he never believed he would get out of prison and had resigned himself to a life inside.

Mr Mandela tells Steirn in one film: ‘I never thought I would come out. But one day they just said, Mandela, you can go home.’

The films aim to record people that have helped define the country since 1990, and also feature Archbishop of South Africa, Desmond Tutu.

The pictures have been released as one of Mr Mandela’s oldest friends spoke out about his time with the man.

QC Sir Bob Hepple plotted to overthrow the apartheid regime with Mr Mandela 50 years ago.

He was arrested in a raid at Lilliesleaf Farm, where police found documents that ensured Mr Mandela’s eventual imprisonment for treason.

Sir Bob said that Mr Mandela was forced to pretend to be his chauffeur, reported The Mirror.

He said: You couldn’t have a white driver and a black passenger. So he would put on a cap and chauffeur’s coat and he would drive me.

‘At the time he loved a musical called King Kong which had just come out - which was about a black boxer and we would both sing songs from that.’

Sir Bob was forced into solitary confinement but made his way to Britain after testifying against his friends.

He said that he never intended to do so, until Mr Mandela spoke to him: ‘He said to me you must make a personal decision. If he had said “whatever you do, don’t do it as it will give them political victory”, I am sure I would have turned them down. But I went ahead with it and was released.’

Mr Mandela and Sir Bob met again at a reception at Buckingham palace.

When the freedom-fighter recognised his old friend, he embraced him.
