Jordan's Queen Rania is spearheading a push to encourage more people to travel to the Middle Eastern kingdom despite terrorist threats or political turmoil in neighbouring countries.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline Travel, she said she is surprised that more Britons don't visit Jordan and assurred holidaymakers that it is safe and filled with unique experiences. 

'Britons prefer an unconventional experience and we have so much to offer,' she said.

Queen Rania, pictured, says tourists to Jordan should expect a 'warm' reception from locals

Her comments came during a tourism event in Amman in which the 44-year-old royal also said the country was stuck 'between a rock and a hard place' - a reference to the conflicts that have blighted the Middle East since 2011.

Despite Jordan's 'bad neighbours', she continued, Britons and others should consider the country 'safe' to visit. 

Since the murder of pilot Muath al-Kasasbi, 26, at the hands of ISIS in February, tourism to the country has plummeted by 17.8 per cent - continuing a trend that begun two years ago.

Just a five-hour flight from the UK, Jordan is around 15 degrees warmer and abundant with fascinating history and culture.

The striking reds and soft undulations of the desert, the implausibly beautiful valley of Wadi Rum rum, cut into the sandstone and granite and the bouyant Dead sea waters should be enough to stir your wanderlust.

In the Unesco World Heritage Site of Petra, famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system visit the treasury and the ancient Nabatean aqueducts.

Or explore the Greco-Roman city of Jerash, taking in the monuments including the Temple of Artemis and Temple of Zeus. 

Climb the 800 steps of the Ad-Deir Monastery or go camel trekking through the desert at sunrise.  

As a result, the country is desperately trying to drum up interest abroad, with tourism chiefs pointing the continued calm in capital Amman and in major tourist sites such as Petra. 

However, Jordan has borders with both Iraq and Syria, and is part of the coalition currently conducting air strikes targeting the terrorists of ISIS. 

Nevertheless, according to Queen Rania, the country is totally safe to visit and was at pains to point out that visitors should expect a 'warm' reception from locals.

Tourism is worth an estimated £2m a year to the Jordanian economy and is one of its biggest employers

'Here in Jordan, we see tourists as more than visitors - we see them as our guests,' she added. 'People will invite you to share a cup of tea or a meal. You will always get a warm welcome.' 

The royal also spoke of the country's history, which includes more than 500,000 sites of archaeological interest, among them 12 crusader-built desert castles and the mighty Petra, and of its striking Dead Sea coastline.
