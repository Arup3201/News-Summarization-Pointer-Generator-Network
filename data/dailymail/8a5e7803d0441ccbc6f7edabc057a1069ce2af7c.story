A lost Emperor penguin is slowly improving after a lifesaving operation by a top New Zealand surgeon - despite nearly 7lb of sand being removed from its stomach.

It has been drawn out with the help of a special camera that identified its position in the penguin's stomach.

Vets say a large amount still remains, but they hope it will be flushed from its body in coming days after the 10-month-old bird - nicknamed 'Happy Feet' - has been fed a mixture of oil, fish and laxatives.

The unfortunate creature became ill after eating wet sand on Peka Peka beach, New Zealand, to keep cool.

It came ashore after losing its way while looking for food in Antarctica, 3,000 miles a way.

Lisa Argilla, a vet at Wellington Zoo, said: 'He's slowly regaining his strength, which is just wonderful news.'

John Wyeth, a leading gastroenterologist at Wellington Hospital, donated his skills to remove sand, sticks and stones from the bird's stomach.

The penguin has been put under an anaesthetic three times in the four days it has been at the zoo while a number of operations have been carried out to clear its throat and stomach.

Dr Wyeth said: 'Hopefully, with a bit of luck, the stomach will now start function of its own accord.

'The bird was really clogged up and it was getting more poorly by the day.'

Ms Argilla added: 'Yesterday he actually punched me in the stomach with his flipper.

'He's been calling and it's really awesome to hear that Emperor penguin call for real and not just on a documentary.'

Experts have said it could be months before Happy Feet is strong enough to be taken by ship to a sub-Antarctic strip of land in the hope that it will be able to finds its way home.

The last sighting of an emperor penguin - the largest of the species - in New Zealand was in 1967.
