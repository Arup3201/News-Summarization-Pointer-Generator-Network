Linda dropped to a size 14 and bagged a starring role as Celia - known for needing 'considerably bigger buns' to cover her chest in the play.

'I am so proud of the way I look and am much more confident in myself.

'I was the first to strip off in the show and I encourage the other ladies.

'Now I have the confidence, I really want to try and do some professional acting. I would love to be in a film.'

Linda, a former supermarket worker who is single, added: 'I was so big I could hardly walk. My BMI was so high I was given surgery on the NHS.

'I spent my life going on fad diets. I would lose three stone, but then put four back on. I was the sort of person who if there were seconds going I would have them.

'I feel like losing weight has taken 10 years off my life. I feel amazing.

'I knew I had to lose weight when I got thinking about people who have leukaemia. They have no choice - but I had a choice to save my life.'

Shy Linda had worked on her self-confidence for years as a member of her local amateur dramatics company the Tudor Player's.
