Perry is one of a string of slender stars who have confessed to wearing Spanx

Ultra skinny Twilight star Kristen Stewart has admitted she wears them on the red carpet

Skinny singer Katy Perry is the latest in a long line of stars to admit to wearing Spanx shapewear.

But unlike most body-conscious celebrities who say they wear the control pants for a smooth line under their clothes, the 28-year-old singer has revealed that she wears them because she can't be bothered to go to the gym.

'I almost always wear Spanx,' said Perry. 'I like to say I train watching CNN but I don't. So I'm like "I guess I'm not fitting into this dress for these couple of months."'

Busted! This was the night that Kristen Stewart (pictured with Twilight co-stars Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson) accidentally revealed her Spanx during an appearance on a U.S. talk show last year

Other stars who have admitted to wearing control pants include super-skinny Twilight actress, Kristen Stewart, who inadvertently flashed her Spanx to the audience during an appearance on a U.S. talk show last year.

The actress managed to repeat the wardrobe malfunction the same day during a visit to the Graumans Theatre in Los Angeles with co-stars Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner to promote the Twilight franchise.

Fellow Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow has also revealed that she's a fan of the control pants, saying: 'There are these great things called Spanx, and they just squeeze you in.

'It’s terrific! That’s how all the Hollywood girls do it!'

America's Next Top Model presenter and former model Tyra Banks has also waxed lyrical about the merits of Spanx, and says that most, if not all, celebrities don them for public appearances.

'Every celebrity walking down the red carpet. You think she’s all just naturally like 'shooop.' A lot of them have Spanx on. You put ‘em on, it sucks you up, baby. No matter what red carpet, I got ‘em on. I look like a granny before I put the dress on, but I put on the dress, and it’s like, 'palow!''

Other fans include reality TV star Kim Kardashian, singer Carrie Underwood and sylph-like actress Sienna Miller.

Even Jessica Alba has confessed to wearing the control pants, saying: 'I wore Spanx under my Fantastic Four costume.

'I love them! Spanx are the only thing that smoothes out all of my lumps and bumps.'
