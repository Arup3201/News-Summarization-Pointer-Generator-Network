Code-crossing football star Karmichael Hunt has been fined $2500 after he pleaded guilty to four counts of cocaine possession but will not have a conviction recorded against him.

The current Queensland Reds player pleaded guilty to the downgraded charges, after he had originally been charged with supplying the illicit drug. 

The fine of $2500 is substantially less than the amount Hunt paid for the drugs, which have a street value of roughly $300 per gram. 

Later in the afternoon, the Australian Rugby Union came down much heavier on Hunt, hitting him with a six-week ban and $30,000 fine. He also stood down from his position of vice-captain at his club.

Football star Karmichael Hunt was all smiles as he left court without a conviction, after he earlier pleaded guilty to cocaine possession. 

Hunt arrives in court prior to pleading guilty to four counts of cocaine possession.

All four charges relate to a month-long period from September 1 to October 4 last year, when Hunt was on a 'regrettable' post-season bender, according to his lawyer, Alastair McDougall. 

Hunt accepted the blame for his actions and apologised to his team and to fans of the game.

'I made a terrible mistake last year and have no one but myself to blame for this situation,' Hunt said in a statement issued this afternoon. 

'I am genuinely sorry for the distress I have caused my family, friends, team mates, Reds members, sponsors, fans and the wider rugby and sporting community in Queensland and beyond.

Earlier in the day, Hunt said he was 'relieved' with the court's decision. 

'I'm looking forward to putting his part of the process behind us and moving on,' he said. 

Hunt is scheduled to have an official press conference on Friday, but speaking outside of court he was 'relieved with the outcome'.

Mr McDougall did not dispute the facts presented by police, and said they were the results of 'poor choices' by his client.

'He'll be paying for those choices for the rest of his life,' Mr McDougall said.

'He has suffered significant economic loss....it's an enormous economic loss.

'This has been a massive, massive wake-up call to him.' 

ARU boss Bill Pulver expressed his disappointment with Hunt, but said the sport will stand behind the embattled player.

'Illicit substances have no place in Rugby,' Mr Pulver said in a statement. 

'However we acknowledge that he is sincerely remorseful and has cooperated with the investigation and our integrity enquiries throughout this process. Karmichael has also accepted the penalty and consequences of his actions and understands the requirements of a professional athlete and the expectations of our code.'

The court heard Hunt liked buying '8-balls' or 'big ones' that contain 3.5g of cocaine, for $1100, from former NRL players. 

All four charges relate to a month-long period from September 1 to October 4 last year, when Hunt was on a 'regrettable' post-season bender, according to his lawyer, Alastair McDougall.

Notices to face court were served to players by the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission.

The court heard Hunt liked buying '8-balls' or 'big ones' that contain 3.5g of cocaine, for $1100, according to the Gold Coast Bulletin. 

Hunt was allegedly turning to fellow former NRL players John Touma and Matt Seers to buy the drug.  

A notice to face court was served to the fallen star by the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission.   

Greg Bird is another of the players due to face court in the coming days. 

Titans players Beau Falloon and Jamie Dowling also fronted court this morning, and saw their cases adjourned until May.

Fellow Titans Greg Bird, Dave Taylor and Kalifa Faifai Loa are expected to face court on Monday along with former teammates Ashley Harrison and Joe Vickery. 

The investigation that tackled Hunt also resulted in notices being served to eight current or former members of the Gold Coast NRL team.
