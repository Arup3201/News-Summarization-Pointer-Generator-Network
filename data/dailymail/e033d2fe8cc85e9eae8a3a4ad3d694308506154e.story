With the Eiffel Tower standing proudly above decorative European buildings, this looks like a magnificent view of the famous French capital.

However, not all is at it seems. Incredibly, this Parisian scene is actually in the middle of China.

The Tianducheng development in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, is filled with grand European buildings and wide walkways.

Ornate fountains and statues also line the streets of the town.

This is a view of the Tianducheng development in Hangzhou, China. Despite being built as a replica of Paris, the town has not proved popular and is virtually empty

Empty: The Tianducheng development in Hangzhou is designed to accommodate at least 10,000 people but it has instead been labelled as a ghost town

Fierce: A huge thunder storm streaks across the Eiffel Tower replica

Replica: With China's love of all things French, the developers must have thought they were onto a winner when they built Tianducheng

Copy-cat: The town is filled with Parisian houses and, despite being in the middle of China, has a distinct European feel

During its construction in 2007, a replica of the Eiffel Tower standing at 108 metres was even built.

There is also a replica of a fountain from the Luxemburg Gardens in a main square called Champs Elys√©es.

With China's love of all things French, the developers no doubt expected the town to be a huge success.

But things haven't quite worked out as they would have hoped.

Different: Despite attempting to look like the famous French city, the town is is surrounded by farmland and dirt roads

Quirky: Almost everything about the town has a European edge, such as this fountain

Odd: This image perhaps best demonstrates the confusion at the heart of the town. A farmer tills the surrounding farmland in front of the Eiffel Tower

Looking good: Despite not exactly proving popular, the town does  look impressive

Quaint: The Tianducheng development is located in the Zhejiang Province of China . This picture shows a farmer's house

Plush: This resident stands on the balcony of his apartment at the development, admiring the empty streets below

Shop: Despite being nowhere near as busy as the developers hoped for, it still contains a number of businesses, including this supermarket

Despite being designed to accommodate at least ten thousand people, the town remains sparsely populated.

Local media have now started labelling it as a 'ghost town', with pictures showing the large streets remaining virtually empty.

Images from the town show how China's aspirations and its traditional culture collide.

Surrounded by farmland and wide roads, farmers can be seen working in fields with the mock Eiffel Tower looming over them.

But it has been labelled a 'ghost town' because fewer people than expected have moved in
