Since Starbucks staff began writing customers' names on their cups in a bid to bring a personal touch to their service, the internet has been awash with snaps of baristas' spelling mistakes.

But this photograph taken in a Hong Kong branch might just be the biggest faux pas yet.

It was taken by a Starbucks customer named Virginia, who was handed her take-away coffee in a paper cup with the word 'Vagina' scrawled on it.

Unacceptable: Virginia's sister posted a photograph of the cup on the Starbucks Hong Kong Facebook page

The picture was posted on the 
Starbucks Hong Kong Facebook page by Virginia's sister Veronica, who 
branded the mistake 'unacceptable'.

Veronica
 Goh said staff had misspelled her sister's name on previous occasions -
 including once when it was written simply as 'Virgin' - and added that 
Virginia's every Starbucks experience was tainted by 'fear and 
anticipation'.

Ms Goh said her sibling had been 'forgiving' up to now, but that the latest incident was the final straw.

'Fancy your staff not being able to spell an American name like Virginia,' Ms Goh posted on Facebook.

'Starbucks HK, you have to buck up or just not spell your customers' name anyway,' she wrote.

'It is a derogatory attitude even if it is not intentional.'

More than 1,700 Facebook users have 'liked' Ms Goh's rant, which was featured on Shanghaiist.com.

It joins the ranks of hundreds of photographs of similar mistakes shared online by Starbucks customers.

Staff at the coffee chain ask customers what their name is as they place their order, then scrawl it on their take-away cup. When their drink is ready, customers are called by name.

The policy was introduced to make staff appear friendly, but has led to entire blogs being devoted to photographs of baristas' often hilarious spelling mistakes.
