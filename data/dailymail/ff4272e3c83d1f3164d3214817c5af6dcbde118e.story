Walmart has everything you could ever need, so why leave?

That seems to be the idea one 14-year-old had when he was caught living in a 24-hour Walmart for two days.

The teen went unnoticed for so long by constantly changing clothes and hiding in two carefully crafted secret forts behind the store's stockpiles of goods.

Images obtained by KTVT show the two compounds, one located in the baby aisle behind boxes of stroller, and the other behind packages of paper towels and toilet paper. He sustained himself off stolen food from the store, cutting a hole in the wall behind the drink aisle to stay hydrated.

The unidentified teen constructed a make-shift bed, and even stole a fish from the store to keep as a pet.

To elude the store's employees, the boy even wore a diaper so as not to be seen using the bathroom multiple times a day.

According to press release from the Corsicana Police Department, the boy was being watched by his aunt on Monday, July 28, when he ran out the wrong door while she was watching TV.

The aunt was watching the boy while his parents, from Rice, Texas, were out of town. She immediately reported him missing to police that afternoon and the mother confirmed that he had a history of running away. She told police he would often stay in creeks, abandoned buildings or businesses when he ran away.

The boy was eventually found Wednesday night after customers noticed piles of trash around the store and alerted employees.

When he was caught, the boy attempted to flee the store but was stopped and has since been turned over to his relatives.

CPS says they are usually called in to investigate cases like this but they haven't in this instance.

Walmart isn't expected to file criminal charges.

Company spokesman Brian Nick has issued a statement, saying: 'This is a sad situation and we are still looking into the details of what happened. As soon as the manager learned that child was hiding in our store we contacted authorities for help and we hope the child is safe.'

The 14-year-old who camped out in Walmart for two days, may have gotten the idea from the 2000 film Where the Heart Is.

The movie, starring a young Natalie Portman, follows the life of 17-year-old Novalee Nation who is moving cross-country with her boyfriend when he abandons her at a Walmart in Oklahoma.

With no money, and no where to go, seven-months-pregnant Novalee decides to make Walmart her home, and lives there for several weeks undetected.  

Inspiration? In the movie Where the Heart Is, Natalie Portman stars as Novalee Nation, a woman who hides for several weeks in an Oklahoma Walmart at the end of her pregnancy

She eludes store employees by hiding in 
the bathroom each night before closing, calls a sleeping bag in the camping section her bed and considerately makes a list of all the items she's 
stolen so that she can one day repay the debt.

It is only when she gives birth to her daughter in the store in the middle of the night that she is eventually found.

Instead of being mad at her for stealing merchandise for weeks, the president of Walmart gifts Novalee $500 after the birth and she eventually gets a job at the same store.
