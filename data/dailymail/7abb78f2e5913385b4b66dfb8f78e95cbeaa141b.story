Grant Shapps said migrants' desire to work hard to provide for their families should encourage them to vote Conservative in May

Immigrants to Britain are natural Conservatives who are finding the party more and more attractive, Grant Shapps has claimed.

The Tory party chairman said the Conservative message of working hard and getting on appeals to voters who have come to settle in Britain and often ‘work every hour’ to provide for their family.

Mr Shapps was responding to Manchester University research, reported in yesterday’s Daily Mail, showing two London seats – Brent North and East Ham – which will be contested at the general election contain a majority of voters born overseas.

Many other constituencies contain large minorities. A record four million migrants born abroad will be entitled to vote in May, half a million more than at the last election.

Cabinet Office minister Mr Shapps said he did not believe the trend posed a threat to his party’s chances in the election.

Mr Shapps, whose father’s Jewish family emigrated from Poland in the late 19th century, said: ‘I see the Conservative party becoming more and more attractive to people from all different backgrounds, particularly because so many of the immigrant communities are people who work hard and get on in life... so I think they are naturally Conservative.’

The Manchester University research has led to speculation that the biggest losers could be the Tories, who have been accused of pursuing anti-immigrant rhetoric in response to the Ukip threat.

Mr Shapps conceded that the election would be ‘incredibly close’, but insisted that David Cameron would not go into a coalition with Ukip if he fails to win a majority in May.
