With uniforms, patrol cars and a shared desire to fight crime, they take to the streets of New York.

These 'vigilante' citizens are among a rising number of Americans who are patrolling the city in what they say is a bid to help the cash-strapped NYPD.

Although the police department officially has 12 'Civilian Observation Patrol' groups, experts believe many more are keeping watch on the streets.

On the lookout: The Howard Beach Civilian Observation Patrol is among a rising number of groups which are patrolling the streets of New York in what they say is a bid to help the city's cash-strapped police department

Ready for action: Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa, whose civilian patrols don red berets (pictured), said such patrols are becoming increasingly vital as the NYPD ­uses more of its resources on anti-terrorism

These include two groups that were launched this year - Sunset Park's Brooklyn Asian Safety Patrol and the Howard Beach Civilian Observation Patrol - as well as NYCHA's Mott Haven Houses.

Residents at the Rockaway Citizens Safety Patrol and private security hired are also believed to be patrolling the city, according to the New York Post.

The Howard Beach COP already has two squad cars, a K-9 unit, a designated hot line and uniforms, all of which were paid for by volunteers. 

Founder Joe Thompson, 47, whose groups is still awaiting police approval, said: 'We're neighbors helping neighbors,' but added: 'We're steering away from the vigilante look.'

Risk: Despite the rise of patrol groups, the Brooklyn Shomrim , an Orthodox Jewish group, came under fire  after murder victim Leiby Kletzky's mother called its hot line to report him missing. Above, a Shomrim group

Community: Hundreds of volunteers launched a search of the borough's neighbourhoods, but did not notify the NYPD of Leiby's disappearance for around two-and-a-half hours. Above, members of the Shomrim group

Transportation: Professor Robert McCrie warned that volunteers must be aware of their legal limitations

Mr Thompson and his fellow volunteers patrol the southwestern neighborhood seven nights a week, tracking non-emergency calls from residents who do not wish to call the NYPD or 311.

The group, which has so far spent a total of $13,000 on equipment, has recently been on the lookout for open garage doors, illegal fishing in Jamaica Bay, stolen equipment and unlawful parking.

One night, they spotted a drunk man urinating next to a tree in a park, but could do nothing more than scold him and report him to the NYPD. 

Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa, whose civilian patrols don  red berets, said such patrols are becoming increasingly vital as the NYPD ­uses more of its resources on anti-terrorism. 

Paid for by volunteers: The professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, saidL 'The organization needs to be cognizant of what they can and cannot do,' he said. 'They are not police ­officers. They are private citizens'

'In the outer boroughs, people never get the top-shelf, five-star ­security that the NYPD gives [to Manhattan],' he said. 

'If you don't do it yourself, you're going to be left in the lurch. There aren't enough cops.'

But Professor Robert McCrie, of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, warned that volunteers must be aware of their legal limitations. 

'The organization needs to be cognizant of what they can and cannot do,' he said. 'They are not police ­officers. They are private citizens, reporting anything suspicious.'

Prepared: Two members of the Guardian Angels group, dressed in red, prepare to take to the city's streets

Volunteers: In the NYPD's official 'Civilian Observation Patrol' programs, volunteers are forced to undergo background police checks, as well as specialist training every two years. Above, Shomrim volunteers

Indeed, the Brooklyn Shomrim, an Orthodox Jewish patrol group, came under fire several years ago after murder victim Leiby Kletzky's mother called its hot line to report him missing.

Hundreds of volunteers launched a search of the borough's neighbourhoods, but did not notify the NYPD of Leiby's disappearance for around two-and-a-half hours. 

In the NYPD's official 'Civilian Observation Patrol' programs, volunteers are forced to undergo background police checks, as well as specialist training every two years.

Members are also required to pay for their own uniforms, cars and other expenses.
