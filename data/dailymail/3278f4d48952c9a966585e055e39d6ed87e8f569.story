As Manchester City jetted out to Spain on Tuesday for their Champions League decider, Bacary Sagna is likely to have packed a few unexpected items... including his selfie stick.

The Premier League champions trail Barcelona 2-1 heading into the last 16 return leg at the Nou Camp on Wednesday with their European hopes in the balance after Luis Suarez returned to England to score a brace at the Etihad in the opening tie.

Speaking to the club's official website while away in Abu Dhabi earlier this season, the France international talked through the contents of his suitcase for away trips in a MTV Cribs-style video interview.

You may expect a Premier League player's travel bag to include an i-Pad, training kits and hair products - but, perhaps not a selfie stick, which Sagna demonstrates ahead of hoping to  take pictures of himself visiting a nearby mosque.

As well as bringing a colourful wardrobe, which is supplemented by his own iron to ensure his clothes are always crisp, the 32-year-old also went through his toiletries - while mistakenly referring to his lip balm as 'lipstick'.

Among his videos stored on his laptop are The Equalizer starring Denzel Washington along with Game of Thrones, Entourage and Breaking Bad box sets.

And, the former Arsenal defender, also revealed he watches a clip of himself scoring a wonder goal during World Cup training with France when he needs 'cheering up'. 

Although Sagna is unlikely to start against Lionel Messi and Co, City may need an inspirational moment like that strike if they are to defy the odds to reach the Champions League quarter finals for the first time in their history.
