David Cameron today said he wanted to help people who ‘work hard’.

But politicians again face charges of laziness as they begin another break less than a fortnight since their last Commons recess.

It means that in the first 151 days of 2013, the Commons will have been convened just 67 times.

Rare sight: Since the start of the year the Commons has sat for fewer than half of the days

To add to the sense of public outrage, it emerged only this week that MPs could be in line for a £20,000 pay rise.

They could take home up to £80,000 a year – more than three times the national average – under new recommendations.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which reports next month, has been looking at an increase of between £10,000 and £20,000.

But the lower figure is considered more likely to try and minimise the public backlash, which would take MPs' pay, currently £65,738, up to £75,000.

Mr Cameron has faced repeated criticism from Labour for missing several Prime Minister’s Questions since the start of the year. During the space of 12 weeks he will face MPs just twice.

In 2012-13 the Commons sat just 145 times, the second lowest figure since 1945 for a year where there was not a general election. Some in Westminster predict it could be even lower this year.

MPs begin their Whitsun recess today and are not due back in Westminster until June 3.

It means they have 12 days off, when even most schoolchildren only have a week.

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'Any MP worth their salt will be hard at work in their constituency during this latest recess.

'However, another week and a half away from Westminster means another week and a half during which ministers will get away without being scrutinised in Parliament by the very people we elect there to hold them to account.

'Week in, week out, we see debates on important legislation being curtailed as a result of strict timetable motions, which result in Bills being passed by MPs without having been subject to detailed scrutiny.

'This is bad for democracy and MPs need to cut down on these recesses in order to allow for more time to be spent in the Commons properly debating new laws and holding the Government to account.'

Labour accused the government of not having enough policies to sustain debates.

SHadow Commons leader Angela Eagle said: ‘David Cameron is scared of scrutiny and the government has run out of ideas.

'It is no wonder we keep going in to recess and that the Prime Minister has only shown up for Prime Minister’s Questions once in the last nine weeks.'

In 2012-13 the Commons sat just 145 times, one of the lowest figures outside a general election year

Since January, MPs have only had a full five-day week in Westminster six times.

They
usually spend Monday to Thursday in Parliament and then have Friday as a
‘constituency day’ to attend local events and meet voters.

The
Commons had a week off in February for half term. It then broke up for 
19 days, returning once when Parliament was recalled for tributes to 
Baroness Thatcher.

David Cameron insisted the government was focusing on repairing the economy

The 
Commons then sat for just eight days before breaking again on April 25, 
this time for prorogation to prepare for the Queen’s Speech on May 8.

It meant a bonus 12 days off, before returning for the pomp and ceremony of the State Opening of Parliament.

Despite setting out more than a dozen
major bills, including legislation on reforming social care and 
pensions, there appears to be no urgency to start debating the laws.

Mr Cameron today insisted he was focusing on the issues which matter to the public.

'People want a country which is fair, which is on the side of people who work hard and do the right thing,' he told BBC Radio 4.

'That’s got to apply to our immigration system, its got to apply to our welfare system, it’s got to apply to our schools. That is what we must focus on.'

The Commons has been convened just eight times since the Queen’s Speech, before breaking up for the latest recess which will last until June 3.

The log jam of holidays is caused by the coalition’s decision to move the Queen’s Speech from the autumn – when the prorogation served as a mini half-term break.

Ministers argue that the Commons is sitting more than in the past, because it now routinely returns for two weeks in September. The summer recess this year last from July 8 to October 8.

Ahead of the last recess Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs Westminster’s spending watchdog, warned the public think politicians are lazy and provide poor value for money.

'We are living through the worst economic crisis in modern times. MPs have a lot to do and yet we are spending much of our time in recess,’ she said.

'Members of the public would be forgiven for thinking that it is MPs who are lazy and that it is Parliament that is failing to provide good value for money.

'We are not spending enough time in Westminster, and this creates a democratic vacuum.'
