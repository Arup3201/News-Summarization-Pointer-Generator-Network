Guilty: Edward Johnstone admitted criminal damage at Trafford Magistrate's Court

A father who accidentally killed two swans while riding a jet ski has admitted causing criminal damage to the Queen's property under an ancient law.

Edward Johnstone, 34, was towing his children on an inflatable raft when the line between them whipped across the water hitting the birds.

The tow rope struck two swans at Sale Water Park, Greater Manchester, where they were seen flapping and unable to lift their heads as the family careered around the waterway.

They died shortly after the incident, Trafford Magistrate's Court heard.

Johnstone, of Wythenshawe, Manchester, told the court
he did not intend to kill the creatures but admitted he was reckless 
while riding the powerful water bike.  

He was charged with criminal damage because under an ancient law swans are the property of the Queen.

Johnstone pleaded guilty to the offence and was given a four-week 
community order with a night-time curfew - he was also ordered to pay £85
court costs.

Lynn Rogers, prosecuting, said witnesses rode out into the water park and removed the swans.

Johnstone
said he and his children were mortified by what had happened and 
left his name and contact details and was later arrested.

He
denied the offence at earlier hearings but pleaded guilty on the day of
his trial on the basis his actions were reckless and not intentional.  

Lyndsay Knaggs, 
defending, said the single dad-of-two, had all the relevant jet ski 
licences and had been to the water park before.

Johnstone told the court: 'That day was just about having fun with the children. I just wanted them to have a good time. My actions caused the swans to die but it was reckless.'  

Chairman of the bench Barry McKenzie said it was an exceptional case and told Johnstone: 'Two living creatures were killed. When swans are killed it's not easy to replace them and there's a loss to public amenity.'

The Queen owns all of Britain's Mute 
swans. The monarchy's ownership of mute swans dates back to the twelfth 
century, when they were considered a delicacy.

In the fifteenth century, the Crown granted livery companies Vintners and Dyers some rights of ownership of mute swans.

Traditionally the swans belonging to 
each company were marked on the beak every year in a ceremony known as 
swan-upping, which still takes place on the river Thames every year in 
the third week of July. Nowadays though it is used to monitor swan populations.

The monarchy's swans were marked by a
royal Swan Marker. The position is still held today, but the Queen's 
Swan Marker's job now includes advising organisations on swan welfare 
and incidents involving swans such as vandalism.

The Queen still owns all unmarked 
mute swans in open water – but only exercises these ownership rights on 
some parts of the Thames and its tributaries.

As native wild birds, swans also enjoy statutory protection under the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and it is an offence to intentionally 
injure, take or kill a wild swan.
