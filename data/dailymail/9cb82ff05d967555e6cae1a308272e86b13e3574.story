Segregation by force of law is no longer legally acceptable in America, but de facto segregation still plagues our schools and neighborhoods, First Lady Michelle Obama told a group of graduating students Friday night.

The First Lady was expected to use the speech to celebrate diversity in America. Instead, she took racism head on, telling the Topeka, Kansas, seniors, 'by some measures, our schools are as segregated as they were back when Dr. King gave his final speech.'

'And even in schools that seem integrated according to the numbers, when you look a little closer, you see students from different backgrounds sitting at separate lunch tables, or tracked into different classes, or separated into different clubs or activities,' she said.

Tonight's speech marked one of the first times Michelle Obama has discussed race publicly since her husband took office.

Her events Friday were
 scheduled after the initial announcement of her trip last month stirred
 criticism in the Kansas capital. She'd initially planned to speak 
Saturday during a combined graduation ceremony for five schools, but 
some parents and students were worried the arena for the speech wouldn't
 be large enough to accommodate all the students' family members.

Democratic
 President Barack Obama received just 38 percent of the vote in 
Republican-leaning Kansas in 2012. GOP Gov. Sam Brownback, a frequent 
critic of the administration, was on stage for the speech.

Also present 
was outgoing U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius,
 who faced criticism after the flawed launch of the federal online 
health insurance marketplace. She's a former two-term Kansas governor.

Supreme Court decision Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, that outlawed segregation in public schools.

The court decided 
unanimously on May 15, 1954 that 'separate educational 
facilities are inherently unequal' and were a violation of the 14th 
Amendment of the United States Constitution.'

Obama called the graduating class of Topeka's high schools the 'living, breathing legacy' of the the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court case, which she said wasn't just 'about our history, it’s about our future.'

'Because while that case was handed down 60 years ago, Brown is still being decided every single day – not just in our courts and schools, but in how we live our lives,' she said. 'Graduates, it's up to all of you to lead the way and drag my generation and your grandparents’ generation along with you.'

'Maybe that starts in your own family, when grandpa tells that awkward joke at Thanksgiving or your aunt says something about “those people,” and you politely inform them that they’re talking about your friends,' she said.

'Or maybe it’s when you have kids of your own one day, and you go to your school board meeting and insist on integrating your schools and giving them the resources they need.

She noted that her special assistant, 
Kristen Jarvis, is the grandniece of Lucinda Todd, a leader with the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Topeka in 
the 1940s and 1950s, the first parent to sign onto the lawsuit 
challenging the city's segregated schools. She said Todd, who died in 
1996, is an example of people who 'choose our better history.'

Obama said that in some cases society was going backward and many schools were becoming less and less diverse as white people move from cities to the suburbs, however.

'As a result, many young people in America are going to school largely with kids who look just like them,' she said. ' And too often, those schools aren’t equal, especially ones attended by students of color which too often lag behind, with crumbling classrooms and less experienced teachers.'

'Our laws may no longer separate us based on our skin color, but there’s
 nothing in our Constitution that says we have to eat together in the 
lunchroom or live together in the same neighborhoods,' Obama told students.

The First Lady said blacks weren't just facing racism in schools.

'We know that today in America, too many folks are still stopped on the street because of the color of their skin, or they’re made to feel unwelcome because of where they’re from, or they’re bullied because of who they love.'

Obama received her primary education after segregation had been banned in
 schools, but was still prevalent in stubborn cities like her hometown 
of Chicago, Illinois.It was not until 1975 that the city opened up its 
first integrated school despite being legal obligated to treat black and
 white students equally under the law.

Michelle Obama 
turned 16 in 1980, more than 25 years after legally endorsed segregation
 in schools ended. The student population at her high school was 96 
percent black, however, because so many white people were leaving the 
South Side of Chicago where Michelle and her family lived.

'She saw firsthand the impact of Brown v. 
Board of
Education in her own life,' senior White House aide Valerie Jarrett told
 the New York Times ahead of Obama's speech. 'What she appreciates is 
the strength of
diversity, how important it is to be in a community, a classroom, where 
you are
hearing from all perspectives.'

Her educational experiences as a child evidently shaped her speech to students attending America's first racially integrated schools on Friday. She said when she gets discouraged about race relations in America, she thinks about 'all the progress I’ve seen in my short lifetime.'

'I
 think about my mother who, as a little girl, went to segregated schools
 in Chicago and felt the sting of discrimination.  I think about my 
husband’s grandparents, white folks born and raised right here in Kansas
 – products themselves of segregation,' she said.

'And then I 
think about how that child grew up to be the President of the United 
States, and how today, that little girl from Chicago is helping to raise
 her granddaughters in the White House.'

Obama encouraged students to push back against racism when they see it in society and to 'never be afraid to talk about these issues, particularly the issue of race.'

Because even today, we still struggle to do that,' she said. 'This issue is so sensitive, so complicated, so bound up with a painful history. '

'Every day, you have that same power to choose our better history – by opening your hearts and minds, by speaking up for what you know is right, by sharing the lessons of Brown v. Board of Education, the lessons you learned right here in Topeka, wherever you go for the rest of your lives.

'I know you all can do it.  I am so proud of all of you, and I cannot wait to see everything you achieve in the years ahead,' she said.
