Takeaways can contain more than three times the amount of salt an adult should eat in an entire day.

Pizzas and Chinese food had the highest levels, in a survey of 215 independent food outlets.

Researchers from Liverpool John Moores University described the levels as 'alarmingly high'.

High salt levels: Takeaways can contain more than three times the amount of salt an adult should eat in an entire day. Pizzas and Chinese food had the highest levels, in a survey of 215 independent food outlets

NHS guidelines recommend adults should eat no more than six grams of salt a day – around a teaspoon.

But the survey found pizzas had the highest salt content with an average of 9.45 grams. Chinese had an average of 8.1 grams, followed by kebabs with 6.2 grams, Indian with 4.7 grams and English with 2.2 grams.

The average pepperoni pizza meal had 
12.94 grams of salt, followed by seafood pizza with an average 11 grams,
and Margherita at 8.8 grams. Ham and pineapple had the lowest, 7.7 
grams.

'The present study is one of the first designed to evaluate the salt content in hot takeaway meals and obtained results show that salt concentration in these kinds of food is alarmingly high,' the researchers told the journal Appetite.

'As voluntary guidelines regarding salt reduction do not result in adequate changes, some statutory regulation to lower salt in takeaway foods should be considered.'

'To enable the UK population to meet the 
recommended daily salt intake a significant reduction in the salt 
content of hot takeaway meals should be considered.'

Unhealthy: English food came out with the lowest amounts of salt - chicken and chips, two grams, and fish and chips three grams

The researchers said that a change in the law may be needed to make pizza outlets, kebab shops other small fast food outlets produce healthier meals.

There has been growing health concerns over the levels of salt in food. It has been linked to a higher risk of high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke, as well as kidney stones, stomach cancer, asthma and osteoporosis.

It has been estimated that lowering salt intakes by only 10 per cent results in a reduction of 6,000 cardiovascular deaths in the UK, with a saving to the economy of £1.5 billion a year.

NHS Livewell recommendations are that adults should eat no more than six grams of salt a day - around one full teaspoon - but the problem is that 75 per cent of the salt eaten is contained in processed food and takeaway and other meals bought outside the home, which makes it difficult to ration.

A number of studies have looked at the salt content of supermarket products, but the researchers say that with a growing number of people eating takeaways - 22 per cent of people buy a takeaway at least once a week - there is an urgent need to investigate salt content.

The study, being reported in the Journal Appetite this week, looked at salt levels in popular hot takeaway meals bought at small, independent outlets in Merseyside and the north west.

Chinese takeaways: The average beef green peppers and black bean sauce with fried rice had nearly 11 grams of salt, while sweet and sour chicken with boiled rice had little more than three

There were wide variations in the Chinese meals. The average beef green peppers and black bean sauce with fried rice had nearly 11 grams of salt, while sweet and sour chicken with boiled rice had little more than three.

'Some Chinese meals contained more than three times the UK salt target,' said the report. `'A single portion of beef and black bean with fried rice contained 27 g of salt and a single portion of prawn chow mein contained 21 g of salt per portion.'

In Indian food, an average portion of chicken tikka masala with keema rice had a salt concentration of nearly seven grams, which was 50 per cent higher than most other Indian dishes.

An average doner kebab and chips had 6.5 grams, while a typical Shish kebab had not much more than four.

English food came out with the lowest amounts - chicken and chips, two grams, and fish and chips three grams. However, the figures do not take into account that many people like to sprinkle salt on their chips.

The researchers said that while big chains are co-operating with guidelines on reducing salt content, there is little interest from small, independent outlets.

'The fact that salt is a cheap ingredient which can make food palatable at a very small cost may be one of reasons why the private catering sector are reluctant to cooperate.

'The present study is one of the first designed to evaluate the salt content in hot takeaway meals from small independent outlets in the UK, and obtained results show that salt concentration in these kinds of food is alarmingly high.'
