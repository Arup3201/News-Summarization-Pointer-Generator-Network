The widower of right-to-die advocate Brittany Maynard has spoken of his wife's final hours with terminal brain cancer, saying a seizure reinforced her decision to take her own life later that day. 

Speaking on The Meredith Vieira Show, Dan Diaz, 43, said his 29-year-old spouse had already decided to  take a lethal prescription of drugs at her Oregon home  to end months of suffering.

But he said a 'small seizure' she suffered on the morning of November 1 - the planned date of her death - reminded her of the painful and downhill struggle she was facing if she chose not to do so.

'It was a reminder of what she was risking because what was coming next was losing her eyesight, becoming paralyzed, inability to speak and she’d be essentially trapped in her own body,' he said.

Couple: Speaking on The Meredith Vieira Show, Mr Diaz said his 29-year-old spouse had already decided to take a lethal dose of drugs - prescribed by her doctor - at her Oregon home to end months of suffering

In the hours after the seizure, Mr Diaz said he and Miss Maynard both slept in until 9am. They then collected their pet dogs and joined their friends and family for a hike near their home, he said.

'We got back to the house and she just knew it was her time,' he added. 

Miss Maynard, who was diagnosed with stage IV glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer - last January and given six months to live, took her own life that evening.

She passed away in her husband's arms and surrounded by her family and friends at her Portland home, the Oregon-based group Compassion & Choices said at the time. 

Speaking of his acceptance of his wife's decision to die, Mr Diaz explained: 'You don’t want to let go of your loved one but to suggest that she should suffer for me, for anyone, no.

'That’s what you struggle with - here’s the person I love and I don’t want to see her go.'

He added that Miss Maynard had never questioned taking a lethal concoction of drugs to end her life, despite reports at the time suggesting that she may be having second thoughts.

Many of these reports cited videos and photos in which Miss Maynard appeared to be in good spirits.

'The weeks leading up to Brittany’s death, her symptoms were getting bad,' he told the show, which will air later this week. 'Those videos were taped 2 weeks before, 3 weeks before.

'Brittany’s seizures were getting worse, they were getting more intense, they were becoming more frequent. The pain she was feeling, the discomfort, the headaches and when those seizures hit.

'There was one instance where we had to go to the hospital. She couldn’t speak for four hours, and the last seizure she had was the most horrific and scary for her.

'Unfortunately, that video, just because of when it came out it gave the impression, "oh, well she looks healthy", but that was not the case whatsoever. Her health was deteriorating daily.' 

On the day of her death, Miss Maynard posted an emotional message to her loved ones and supporters via Facebook. It read: 'Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love.

'Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me … but would have taken so much more.

'The world is a beautiful place, travel has been my greatest teacher, my close friends and folks are the greatest givers. I even have a ring of support around my bed as I type.

'Goodbye world. Spread good energy. Pay it forward!' 

In the weeks leading up to her death - committed under Oregon's Death with Dignity Act - Miss Maynard hit headlines around the world and became the face of the  right-to-die movement.

In an interview with People, which will feature in the magazine's Friday edition, Mr Diaz said life in the wake of his wife's death often feels lonely, saying: 'I have good days and bad days.'

He added: 'The feeling of loss is always there – particularly in the morning when I first wake up. And at night, when the house is quiet and I'm just there with the dogs. I think about her every day.'

Mr Diaz, who remains on leave from his job as a senior manager in the food industry, is now focused on fulfilling a promise he made to Miss Maynard to help get right-to-die laws passed nationwide.

His efforts are starting with the couple's home state of California, which they moved away from following Miss Maynard's diagnosis in a bid to allow her to end her own life legally in Oregon.

Mr Diaz's full interview with The Meredith Vieira Show' will air on January 14.
