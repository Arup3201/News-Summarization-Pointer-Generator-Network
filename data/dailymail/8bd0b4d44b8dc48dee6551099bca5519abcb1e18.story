A Ukip candidate has resigned his 
membership of the party after suggesting comedian Lenny Henry should 
emigrate to a ‘black country’.

William
 Henwood, of Enfield, north London, made the comment on Twitter in 
response to a speech by Henry in which he said ethnic minorities were 
under-represented on British TV.

The resignation comes as Ukip today launched a purge of extremist members with Nigel Farage launching a fightback against claims his supporters are racist.

One man has been suspended for being a
 member of the far-right British National Party while a second was 
discovered to have been a donor to the Engilish Defence League.

William Henwood, a Ukip member who told comedian Lenny Henry to 'emigrate to a black country', has now agreed to leave the party.

A Ukip spokesman said Mr Henwood had 
resigned his membership of Ukip after it was 'mutually agreed this would
 be the best course'.

Ukip is expected to win elections to the European Parliament on May 22, which Mr Farage predicts will trigger a ‘political earthquake’ in Westminster.

But his £1.5million campaign has been dogged by claims it is racist and features actors and party employees as ordinary members of the public.

Mr Farage claimed attempts to portray Ukip as racist will prove a 'disastrous mistake' for the established political parties.

But today it emerged the party has been forced to suspend two members with far-right links.

A spokesman said: 'UKIP is a non-racist, non-sectarian party and we are determined to uphold those values.

'Part of that process is maintaining vigilance against the possibility of infiltration either on an organised or individual basis by those who do not subscribe to our values.'

The men have not been identified by the party as they still have the right of an appeal in writing to Ukip's national executive committee.

William Henwood, a Ukip candidate in Enfield, north London, tonight resigned from the party.

It followed a row over a tweet he sent about Lenny Henry 
saying: ‘He should emigrate to a black country. He does not have to live
 with whites.’

A UKIP Spokesman said: 'Mr Henwood's remarks about Lenny Henry caused enormous offence and UKIP MEP candidate for the West Midlands Bill Etheridge spoke for many in the party with his strong condemnation.'

Former Labour immigration minister Barbara Roche today launched a cross-party campaign to condemn Ukip as racist.

‘Ukip's campaign needs to be exposed for what it is, a racist campaign,’ she told The Guardian.

‘The party is practicing what is in effect a form of ‘Euracism’.’

The Migration Matters campaign has been co-sponsored by senior Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi and Lib Dem peer Lord Dholakia.

But
 on the campaign trail in Slough today, Mr Farage hit back and accused 
his opponents of use ‘discrgraceful slurs’ against the British people.

He
 said: ‘I am really sorry that millions of people who have decided to 
vote UKIP next month now find themselves accused by the political 
establishment of supporting racism.’

A new poll shows how Ukip's support is highest in England

A Ukip MEP has defended saying it is OK to dislike gay people.

Roger Helmer said the choice was like having a favourite cup of tea.

He told The Sun: 'Different people have differenttastes. You may tell me you don’t like Earl Grey tea.

'That may be a minority view but you are entitled not to like it if you don’t like it.'

He was defending comments made as Tory in 2000 when he said people find homosexuality 'distasteful if not viscerally repugnant'.

He likened it to the moment Labour leader Gordon Brown dismissed pensioner Gillian Duffy as a ‘bigoted woman’ during the 2010 election after she voiced cocnerns about immigration.

‘This time it is not merely one person being slandered by one establishment party but huge numbers of decent British people under attack and all three Westminster parties levelling the charge of racism and bigotry.

‘When UKIP was perceived mainly as a threat to the Conservative Party, it was David Cameron and his colleagues who used this tactic. Now we are recognised as a threat to the entire establishment it is all three parties that are slinging mud.

‘The electorate is not in the mood to be intimidated by the political establishment and Messrs Cameron, Miliband and Clegg have just made another disastrous mistake.

‘I call on all fair-minded British people to swing behind UKIP and teach these creeps a lesson they won't forget in a hurry.'

Jacqui SMith, the former Labour Home Secretary, also questioned the anti-Ukip campaign.

'I am not convinced that condemning the many voters thinking of voting Ukip as stupid racists is a good electoral strategy, she wrote for Progress.

It comes as a new survey showed Ukip’s appeal is much stronger in England than it is in Scotland or Wales.

The research suggested that in England, Ukip is challenging Labour for first place in the European Parliament elections on May 22.

A survey found 29 per cent of people in England intend voting for Nigel Farage's party, just behind the 30 per cent set to back Labour.

A total of 22 per cent said they would vote for the Conservatives, while 11 per cent said they would be voting Liberal Democrat.

But in Scotland, only one in 10 of those surveyed said they would be voting Ukip, compared with the 33 per cent who plan to vote SNP and the 31 per cent who said they would back Labour.

Scottish support for the Tories in the European elections was put at 12 per cent, while for the Liberal Democrats it was 7 per cent.

In Wales, support for Labour was almost twice the level of support for Ukip, with the survey suggesting 39 per cent of voters would back Ed Miliband's party compared with the 20 per cent who said they would vote Ukip. A total of 18 per cent of Welsh voters who were surveyed plan to vote Tory, with 11 per cent backing Plaid Cymru and 7 per cent supporting the Liberal Democrats.

Within England, Ukip support was found to be stronger among those who identified themselves as being English rather than British.
