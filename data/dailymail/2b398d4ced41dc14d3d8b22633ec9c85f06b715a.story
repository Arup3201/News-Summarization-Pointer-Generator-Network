Roger Federer remains on course for his sixth Western & Southern Open title after advancing to the final with victory over Milos Raonic.

The Swiss world number three is in a rich vein of form and will face David Ferrer in his fourth consecutive ATP final after winning in Halle and falling at the last hurdle at Wimbledon and in Toronto.

The semi-final was a fairly straightforward affair with Raonic providing little resistance as Federer won 6-2 6-3.

Federer did not drop a point on his serve in the first set and needed just a single break in the eighth game of the second to close out a routine win.

'I'm playing much better (than) last year. I can move freely again,' Federer told ESPN. 'I'm happy the results show. It's more fun playing this way. Now I am playing the right away.

'It's great for the confidence to switch from clay to grass to hard courts and keep on playing well. I've had a very complete season so far.

'This is my eighth final of the season. I hope I can win another final here.'

Normal service: The Swiss star is enjoying tennis at the moment as he reached his eighth final of the year

Tough time: Raonic failed to win a single point on Federer's serve in the first set 

Ferrer advanced to his 45th ATP Tour final on Sunday after beating Julien Benneateau 6-3 6-2.

The 32-year-old Ferrer is chasing his second title of the season, having won the Copa Claro in February, and is hitting form at the right time ahead of the US Open.

This win took just 72 minutes to complete, with 20 winners and a 40 per cent success rate with break points.

In the women's draw, Serena Williams is a win away from her first title in Cincinnati after beating close friend Caroline Wozniacki 2-6 6-4 6-2.

Williams now has an 8-1 record against the Dane, with this victory one of her most hard-fought with Wozniacki having been 4-2 ahead in the second set and on course for victory.

'I got off to a little bit of a slow start, but I was definitely in it,' Williams told the official WTA website.

Rampant: David Ferrer took little over an hour to see off Julien Benneteau and reach the final

Outclassed: The two men share a moment at the end of the match which Ferrer won 6-3 6-2

'I was just physically grinding and trying to get in there and really just trying to grind out everything.

'She's a really good returner and she was getting everything back and making some good shots.'

Williams will face Ana Ivanovic in the final after the former world number one overcame Maria Sharapova 6-2 5-7 7-5.

After taking the first set, Ivanovic led 4-0 in the second and looked to be cruising before Sharapova hit back with the Russian leading 4-2 in the third.

Stretched: Williams was made to work hard for her victory over Wozniaki, coming from a set and a break down

But Ivanovic was not to be beaten and battled back to set up a final against Williams.

'For me, the most important thing is recovery for tomorrow and trying to be fresh,' she said. 'It's going to be a great match, I think. We played three times this year already.

'I think it's going to be a great test for me as well to play against Serena. She's the number one player in the world and she's a great champion, so I think it's going to be a good match. I hope it goes well.'
