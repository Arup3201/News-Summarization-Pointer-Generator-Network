Drowned: Andrew Collings, 12, died after entering the River Cam last night and failing to resurface

The body of a 12-year-old boy was pulled from the River Cam near Cambridge this morning, after he was seen entering the water last night and failed to resurface.

The schoolboy has been named locally as Andrew Collings, and is believed to have been playing on a footbridge which is a popular spot for jumping into the water.

Rescuers launched a nine-hour hunt for the boy as his family looked on, but were unable to save him.

Cambridgeshire Police are not treating the death as suspicious and have passed the case to the coroner for further investigation.

Specialist rescue teams, paramedics, four fire crews, a rescue vehicle, five police cars and a police helicopter joined the overnight search.

Emergency services attended the scene after receiving reports that the boy entered the river at Lammas Land on the Fen 
Causeway on the outskirts of the city around 6pm yesterday.

He was believed to been playing with three friends by a footbridge which is often used to jump into the river and which was today cordoned off by police.

Tributes: Friends took to Twitter today to mourn the death of the schoolboy

A police spokesman said: 'Police were
called at 6.24pm to reports of a 12-year-old boy entering the water 
near to Lammas Land, Cambridge.

'Emergency
services carried out an area search and a body was discovered at 3am 
this morning. The death is not being treated as suspicious.'

The boy's family watched as police paramedics, fire crews and a helicopter searched the water while rescue teams dredged the river.

One witness said: 'The police helicopter was up and the firefighters were everywhere. They were going up and down the river looking for a child.

'We heard that four boys had gone into the river but only three came out and one didn't.'

Heartfelt tributes have been left at the scene - dedicated to 'Andy AKA Littleman'.

One, signed from 'Molli', reads: 'Rest in Peace Andy, I'm sorry I wasn't always there for you wasn't the best friend but i'm going to miss you. Love you lots, Molli'

Another signed from 'Daisy' read: 'R.I.P Andy. I'm sorry I wasn't always nice to you but I love you so much, you were the little brother I never had. I'll miss you so much, RIP Prince. I love you.'

Another - which was unsigned - said:'I never knew it would be the last time I saw you, sleep tight Little Mail, so cause trouble elsewhere!'

Tiffany Abbs, and Sophy Simpkins wrote: 'Bruv, we will miss you greatly always. Til we meet again.'

One card appears to have been written by those involved in the rescue attempt.

It said: To the young lad and his family. We are so sorry we could not get to you. We tryed (sic) so hard. God rest you and god bless all those you left behind. xxx'

Search: Rescuers looked for the 12-year-old for nine hours before retrieving his body early this morning

Investigation: Police said they were not treating Andrew's death as suspicious

A
police spokesman said that it was not clear if he fell into the water or went in 
deliberately before getting into difficulty, but added that foul play was not suspected.

Andrew, from Cambridge, is believed to be the son of bouncer Andrew Collings, 43, and Ellan Collings, 37.

This morning, friends took to Twitter to pay tribute to the schoolboy after learning of his death.

Kristy Goodsell wrote on the site, 'R.I.P Andy Collings x x x', and Annicee Warner tweeted: 'rip andy collings'.

Caroline McKenney, headmistress of the city's Netherhall School where Andrew was a pupil, said: 'The school extends its deepest condolences to Andy's family.

'When the time is right we will be speaking to his family and students at the school to find a suitable way of remembering him.'

Friends thought he was playing a practicaljoke when he started to struggle after jumping into the river, it has since emerged.

Mike Cordner, whose daughter was with Andy and three other boys, said the otherchildren thought Andy was messing around, but soon realised he was in trouble.

Another parent, whose son was in Andy's school class, said he was not a verystrong swimmer and may have struggled to get out of the river.Â 

Mr Cordner said: 'My daughter came running in saying that one of her friendshad drowned in the river. I ran straight down there from where we live.

'Police already had guys in suits with ropes in the water, police were in punts so they could look in the water. Everyone was trying to do what they could.'

Donna and Andrew Frost said their son Charlie had been playing with Andrew and the others earlier in the evening.

'We have always believed it is safe to swim in the river so this tragedy is a complete shock.

'I have three boys and they often swim here. But the river is not dredged and there are no life rings.

'Lots of people swim in the river and when it is a beautiful sunny day as it was you can see why Andy and his friends went in.

'Apparently two or three of them jumped in and one managed to get hold of him but couldn't save him.

'Andy's father was there at the search, but his mum wasn't. I think the police told her to stay at home in case Andy turned up there.

'It is such an awful time for the family. It is every mother's worst nightmare. We're all cut up about it, he was such a lovely lad.'

A spokesman for East of England 
Ambulance Service said: 'We received the call at 6.11pm to an incident 
involving a 12-year-old boy in water.

'We sent three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle and a land crew from East Anglia Air Ambulance.'

He added: 'First and foremost our thoughts are with the boy's family at this tragic time.'
