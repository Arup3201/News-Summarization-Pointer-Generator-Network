Giving schoolchildren hot lunches can be better for their learning than extra English and maths lessons, Nick Clegg claimed today.

The Deputy Prime Minister said it was not surprising that children with packed lunches consisting of 'a slice of white bread with some chocolate spread in it and a fizzy drink' struggled to concentrate.

He hailed a scheme offering almost 2million children aged under-7 who will be given free school meals which begins today.

Nick Clegg, visiting Clapham Manor Primary School in London today, said school meals were better than packed lunches

The Deputy Prime Minister launched the policy which will see 2million children aged under 7 receive free school lunches from this week

Almost two million infants will be fed at their primary school at no cost to their parents from today under the Liberal Democrat policy, saving families up to £400 per year.

Mr Clegg insists offering free meals to all pupils, not just those from low income families, will make them healthier and improve academic attainment.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The evidence, and this has been exhaustively analysed, piloted, examined, is that giving a healthy hot meal at lunchtime is as, if not more, effective than many of the, say, literacy and numeracy initiatives which have been undertaken in the past in the classroom. It has a dramatic effect.'

Mr Clegg today visited a school in London to launch the free meals scheme.

He added: 'The evidence quite simply shows that this not only has a dramatic effect on those four in ten children who are in poverty but presently don't receive free school meals, the evidence also shows it's a great help to household budgets.

'It helps families save £400 per child for meal costs every year, but in the school where we piloted this...the children who were receiving a healthy meal at lunchtime are generally doing better - two months in advance in English and maths compared to their classmates.

'If you have children, and this does unfortunately happen, who turn up with a lunch box with a slice of white bread with some chocolate spread in it and a fizzy drink, it's not surprising they don't concentrate well in the afternoon.' 

He insisted that providing lunch for every five to seven-year-old at England's 16,500 primary schools will be more beneficial than some attempts to boost academic achievements.

As the programme was launched, Mr Clegg vowed not to let critics 'cloud' his goal of creating a level playing field for all children, adding that the scheme is 'one of the most progressive changes to our school system for a long time'.

The offer of free school meals for all infant pupils in England was announced by Mr Clegg at last year's Lib Dem conference, at a cost of £600million a year.

Mr Clegg argued the policy would improve children's health and academic attainment, and help parents struggling with the cost of food

From this month an extra 1.89million children will qualify for the meals, regardless of their parents' income.

It is expected to save even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child.

But the policy has caused huge rows in the coalition, with Lib Dems accusing Tory Michael Gove of 'lying' about its implementation.

Mr Clegg was forced to announce an extra £150million to build and extend kitchens to cope with the expected demand.

The Local Government Association survey of 75 councils found that nearly half (47 per cent) said they had not received enough money from the Department for Education (DfE) to cover the full cost of the work they needed to do to ensure that schools in their area were ready to provide universal free meals for infants.

Councils have complained that they have struggled to find the money to expand kitchens and dining halls to implement the policy

The shortfall across those councils that responded totals around £25.9 million, the association estimated.

Of those that said that they did not have enough money, 49 per cent said that the council would help to make up the difference, with just over a third (37 per cent) saying at least some of the cash would come from school funds.

Authorities had also reported that money could be taken from general school funding intended for school repairs and maintenance, the association said.

The LGA said it had calculated that councils without enough money for the scheme have had to find an estimated £488,000 on average to ensure that pupils will get the meals they will be entitled to.

It added that some schools will give pupils packed lunches and others will use portable kitchens to ensure they can offer the free lunches when the new school year starts, and work will continue on options for providing hot meals.
