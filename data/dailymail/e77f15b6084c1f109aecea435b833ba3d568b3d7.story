An ex-Miss Belgium arrived at court today to defend her far-right campaign's use of Louboutin heels in a poster denouncing Islam - wearing a pair of the signature red-soled shoes.

Anke Van Dermeersch, who is a senator of extreme anti-immigrant party Vlaams Belang, smiled for the cameras as she arrived at Antwerp trade court in the black and red luxury stilettos.

Shoe designer Christian Louboutin is seeking an injunction against the party's latest campaign, which he claims has associated his iconic brand with a poster condemning Islam.

Hopeful: Ms Dermeersch, a senator of 
anti-immigrant party Vlaams Belang, smiled for the cameras as she 
arrived at court wearing a pair of the black and red luxury stilettos

The poster - titled 'Women against Islamisation' - shows the bare legs of Ms Dermeersch, who is wearing a pair of red-soled Louboutins while lifting up a black dress.

The 40-year-old former beauty queen, who was voted Miss Belgium in 1991, has words etched along her naked leg marking potential skirt lengths.

They range from 'Sharia compatible' at the ankle to 'stoning' high up her thigh.

This is loosely inspired by a
photograph by Canadian feminist Rosea Lake titled 'Judgements', which went viral in January.

The image depicts various skirt lengths ranging from 'matronly' and 'prudish' to 'provocative' and 'whore'.

The Vlaams Belang's poster carries the slogan 'Liberty or Islam', as well as the party's email address.

Famous: A pair of the French designer's iconic red-soled shoes

Paris-based Louboutin argues that the ad
tarnishes the image of his luxury footwear brand, which is a favourite 
with stars including Victoria Beckham, Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and Kate 
Moss.

He has asked the court to issue an emergency 'cease and desist' ruling against the anti-Islam campaign.

A decision is expected to be made today.
