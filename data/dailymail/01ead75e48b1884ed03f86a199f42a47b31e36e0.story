A seven-year old girl was raped at her school in New Delhi on Thursday, according to police.

The injured girl was taken by her parents from the school in the Mangolpuri area to the Sanjay Gandhi hospital nearby for treatment.

Doctors there confirmed that she had been sexually assaulted.

According to the girl's family, the incident happened after the girl had been having lunch at the government-run school. The girl said that she did not recognise her attacker.

Outside the hospital around 400 people led a demonstration for three hours on Friday morning to put pressure on police to take the complaint seriously.

Police dispersed the crowd with batons after protesters began pelting stones at them and vandalised two buses.

This latest incident comes against a backdrop of growing anger over attitudes to rape and sexual violence in India.

There were huge protests in New Delhi in December after a 23-year-old student was gang raped on a bus and subsequently died.Â

Her father said that she had 'awakened the nation's conscience' as thousands of people turned out to mourn her death.

Two of the most notable cases over the past month involved another seven-year-old girl at a school in Goa, prompting protests outside her school.

Another rape resulted in the death of three girls on Valentine's Day in in the Bhandara district near the city of Nagpur.

The police are questioning a guard and two male teachers from the school.
