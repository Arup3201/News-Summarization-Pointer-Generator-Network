The trial of a boy who killed his high school girlfriend rages on as prosecutors allege that he brutally strangled and slit the neck of his girlfriend because he was humiliated by their break up.

Nathan Fujita, who is now 20 years old, is on trial for the murder of Lauren Astley in July of 2011, just weeks after she graduated Wayland High School in Woburn, Massachusetts.

His defense attorney is arguing that he suffered a psychotic break but the assistant district attorney argues that he planned the attack and took a number of steps to purposefully try to cover up the murder.

'Evidence will show you that the man you just heard sworn before you, Nathaniel Fujita, a man Lauren Astley had known and cared for, a man she had gone out with in high school for three years, coldly, cruelly killed her, because she wounded his ego,' assistant district attorney Lisa McGovern said.

'This defendant attacked Lauren to get her back to hurt her, and to nullify her in a purposeful and deliberate way, calculated not only to inflict pain but to end her life and also to cover up what he was doing,’ Ms McGovern said according to The Boston Globe.

The teenage relationship ended a few weeks before Lauren's badly beaten body was found in marshland, with a gaping hole in her neck, in July 2011.

Authorities claim the former high school football player was despondent over the couple’s April breakup, saying Fujita’s mother secretly met with Astley out of concern for her son’s well-being.

'She decided she should reach out to him and make sure he was doing OK,' Ms McGovern said.

'The defendant reciprocated that act of friendship by killing her.'

Fujita, who was then 18, is accused of strangling Miss Astley so forcefully that her eyes, neck, face and gums hemorrhaged.

Hiding evidence: The prosecutor said Nathanial had a Google search asking 'does water erase fingerprints'

Prosecutors believe Fujita - who is the son of a Berklee College of Music professor - cut his ex-girlfriend's throat, strangled her with a bungee cord and dumped her body in a swamp.

'Her death came in minutes, not in seconds,' Ms McGovern said in court.

Victim: Phone records show that 18-year-old Lauren talked to Nathanial several times before going to meet him after she finished work at the local mall

One of the biggest points of argument is whether or not the murder was premeditated; the prosecution argues that he actively planned the killing and tried to cover it up afterwards, while the defense argues that he snapped.

Prosecutors believe Fujita took Astley’s Jeep Grand Cherokee from his home and drove it to the Wayland Town Beach parking lot, then dumped the keys in a storm drain.

Phone records show that as she finished up her shift at a local store on the final day of her life, Fujita and Lauren had a number of conversations and she told co-workers that she was going to meet him after she left the mall.

Her parents reported her missing shortly after she failed to return home from work that day.

Fujita was arrested after a search of his family's home found blood in the garage and his clothing - which was stained with blood - stashed in the attic.

Fujita was spotted driving shirtless, car windows down and music blaring, mere moments after allegedly dumping the 18-year-old's body, according to the filings.

The papers allege Fujita drove from the marsh to his parents’ home the night of July 3, then called and asked them to come home so the family could watch a film together.

Prosecutors believe Fujita, killed his
college-bound ex-girlfriend at his parents’ house. He allegedly loaded 
her 5-foot, 100-pound body into his Honda.

Prosecutors allege Fujita made an 
elaborate but failed attempt to cover up; police found bloody clothing 
and sneakers in the Fujita home, in addition to a second pair of wet 
sneakers and a sweatshirt with mud in the pockets.

His internet records show that at 12.58am on the evening of the murder, he did a search on Google asking: 'Does water erase fingerprints?'

The woman who found Astley’s body 
testified in court on Wednesday, saying that at first she was hesitant 
to go over to the lake where she thought she spotted a pair of knees.

Priscilla Antion, who discovered the 
body while out on a bird-watching bike ride, but rather than spotting 
the blue heron that she had hoped for, she saw what looked like a 
disposed body.

‘I almost talked myself out of it. I said, I’m gonna leave, this isn’t real,’ she said in court.

‘And then I thought somewhere, if this
is real, there’s somebody who is waiting for someone to call or someone
to walk through that door, and their loved one’s not there. I had to 
make sure.’

Fujita’s lawyer William Sullivan is 
planning to approach the case by saying that his client had a mental 
episode, which he deems possible given his family history of mental 
illness and his prior recorded instances of depression.

If convicted, he will be sentenced to 
life in prison without the possibility of parole. If the jury argues 
that he committed the murder but did not do so with criminal intent- 
effectively agreeing with the mental instability argument- then he will 
be committed indefinitely.
