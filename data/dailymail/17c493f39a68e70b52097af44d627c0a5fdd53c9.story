Tia Sharp's accused murderer is being kept under 24-hour watch after prisoners have threatened to kill him, it is being claimed.

Stuart Hazell, the 12-year-old's step-grandfather is in isolation in Belmarsh Prison, in Woolwich, south east London, where some of the country's most dangerous criminals are kept.

The Sun reported that the 37-year-old is being kept on a secure wing in the Category A prison alongside paedophiles and rapists.

Natalie Sharp and David Niles lay flowers at a memorial for the 12 year old an The Lindens, New Addington on August 15, 2012, as Tia's step-grandfather, Stuart Hazell, appeared at the Old Bailey by video link charged with murder

Inmates are screaming death threats and calling his name from their cells, The Sun claimed.

A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice refused to confirm which prison Hazell is being kept in.

Today he appeared at the Old Bailey charged with murdering the schoolgirl between August 2 and 11.

confirm his name and the fact he could hear proceedings as he sat 
emotionless throughout ten minute hearing.

Justice for Tia: The 12-year-old's body was found dumped in her grandmother's attic

He appeared via video link from Belmarsh, the UK's top security prison, sitting at a table next to a prison guard as the dates for his case were set down.

Unemployed Hazell was charged after Tia's body was found in the loft of the home he shares with his partner and Tia's grandmother Christine Sharp on Friday August 10.

Hazell is being represented by top barrister Lord Alex Carlile QC, who successfully defended Princess Diana's Butler Paul Burrell and carried out a review of the government's anti-terror laws.

He is receiving legal aid for both his QC and a junior counsel.

Lord Carlile warned: 'We do not know what the case against this defendant is, there has been some speculation in the media for example about the cause of death but there is no evidence whatsoever, it is no more than speculation.

'It would be dangerous and possibly foolish to to indulge in speculation that may run the risk of prejudicing a fair trial. We have no idea what the issues will be until we have at least the scientific evidence.

'It is also possible there will be a lot of factual background, with some eminating from family members.'

But as the trial will be heard by a High Court Judge a trial date in January 2013 was provisionally set.

Hazell is expected to enter his pleas at a hearing on November 19.

Tia's body was eventually found on 
Friday at her grandmother Christine Sharp's home in New Addington, 
Croydon - eight days after she was reported missing and after police had
searched the home on several occasions.

Hazell is the boyfriend of Mrs Sharp,
46, who was arrested on suspicion of murder but bailed on Sunday 
pending further inquiries, along with her next door neighbour Paul 
Meehan, 39, who was bailed on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Detectives suspect the schoolgirl was probably smothered before her body was hidden in the attic.

A pathologist found no obvious major injuries to her body, leading to the theory that she was smothered or strangled.

An initial examination apparently uncovered 
bruising but forensic experts have been hampered by 
the badly decomposed state of the corpse when it was finally recovered 
from the sweltering roof space last Friday.

Although Tia had clearly been dead 
for some time, officers have not been able to rule out that the 
schoolgirl was alive when colleagues first visited the council house in 
New Addington, near Croydon, South London, after she vanished a week 
earlier.

Her father, Steve Carter, has demanded 'justice' for his little girl.

Mr Carter, 30, said: ‘I just want to get justice for my daughter, the proper way.

‘The
last time I saw Tia she jumped in my arms. She told me about her school
and what she was doing. She called me Dad. I’ll miss her for ever.’

A serious case review has been launched into the death of the little girl.

Serious Case Reviews are carried out 
when a child has died to look at the role played by local agencies in 
the life of that child and their family. The review aims to find out if 
any lessons can be learned about ensuring children’s safety.

Merton
Council, which has responsibility for Mitcham, where Tia had lived with
her mother Natalie, said it was 'standard procedure' to carry out a 
review.

Chief executive Ged Curran said: 'Our thoughts and condolences go out to all those who knew Tia.

'The
local safeguarding children board will now commission a serious case 
review, the standard procedure in a tragic case such as this. The review
will be assisted by the police, health services and local authorities.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
