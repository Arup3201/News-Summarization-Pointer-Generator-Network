Watching Barcelona train on Luis Suarez's first day back at work at the weekend several things were apparent.

One, that Suarez had lost none of his sharpness. Two, that Barcelona's intensive passing drills remain a sight to behold. And three, that Alex Song looks anything but out of place pinging the ball one touch between the flying tackles, to team-mates Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi.

Song has become a figure of fun since his switch to the Nou Camp last summer - last week he even managed to injure new goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen in training.

On the move? Barca are looking to offload Song on either a loan or permanent deal this summer

Preparation: Song has been busy training for the new season but did not play a minute of Barca's final friendly

It was the first thing of note he had done all pre-season but despite the strange two-year sabbatical in Spain it would be a mistake for Arsene Wenger or any other Premier League suitor to believe he no longer has what it takes for the Premier League. 

The first joke came in his presentation when he was introduced as someone who could operate just as well in the centre of defence as in midfield. The punchline was that even he didn't believe that.

The fact that he could not play in the centre of defence meant he would only make it into the first team ahead of Sergio Busquets and the Spain midfielder's name is practically chiseled in stone in the Barca first XI. That remains the case despite a poor season and World Cup.

On the few occasions Song has played he has done nothing wrong. But that is not enough at Barcelona. 

Doing nothing wrong will not keep you in the team, only doing something spectacularly right will, and he has not managed that.

Favourite: Song has found it almost impossible to take Sergio Busquets' place in Barca's starting XI

Exit: Song is not needed  after the summer signings of Ivan Rakitic, Thomas Vermaelen and Jeremy Mathieu

Tito Vilanova tried to, without success, use him at the back, Tata Martino liked his strength and energy and even considered playing him and Busquets in the team but a change of system was too radical an idea. Now new coach Luis Enrique has taken a look at his squad and decided he has no use for Song. 

The hint was dropped in spectacular fashion on Monday night when Barcelona used 22 players and Song was the only one who never got so much as a minute on the pitch in the final friendly of pre-season.

Busquets will play again this year and now that Barcelona have signed some central defenders Javier Mascherano can also operate in midfield. Song is even further down the queue.

Experienced: Song provided a physical presence in Arsenal's midfield before his move to the Nou Camp in 2012

New boy: Barca signed Song for £15million but he has failed to command a regular starting spot since

His signing was a mistake. Barcelona didn't need him and he has wasted two years of his career but in every training session in that two year period his first touch, vision and speed of pass will have been improved.

He cannot fail to have taken something from 24 months alongside Xavi and Andres Iniesta. He remains a fine athlete, a strong runner, a driving force from deep and he has polished his passing on the training pitches of Barcelona's Joan Gamper Sports City, if not at the Nou Camp.

Premier League tested he would not be a gamble. He would be expensive, which is why Barcelona are struggling to sell him, but for any team lacking in the centre of midfield, he might just be worth it.
