Anglea Merkel looks set to equal Margaret Thatcher's record by winning a third term in German elections tomorrow although her coalition stands almost neck-and-neck with opposition parties.

A survey for broadcaster RTL last night showed the German chancellorâ€™s Christian Democratic Union and its sister Bavarian party the Christian Social Union 14 points ahead of the centre-Left Social Democrats.

This means she will almost surely return for another four-year term.

Anglea Merkel is on track to win a third term in German elections tomorrow although her coalition stands almost neck-and-neck with opposition parties.

As campaigning entered its final stage before the election tomorrow, Merkel faced a battle to preserve her centre-right majority and avert a potentially divisive 'grand coalition' with her rivals on the left.

But her combined centre-Right bloc was in a dead heat with Left-leaning opposition parties yesterday, with both camps on 45 per cent, putting her coalition in jeopardy.

Mrs Merkel could win a narrow majority with the FDP, her preferred 
partner, be forced into difficult negotiations with 
the SPD which could last up to two months and result in big changes to 
her cabinet, including the departure of Finance Minister Wolfgang 
Schaeuble, a key player in the crisis.

The election is being watched across Europe, with many countries hoping it will bring about a softening of the austerity-first approach Mrs Merkel has promoted since the eurozone debt crisis broke out nearly four years ago.

The wild card is a new anti-euro party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is given a decent chance of vaulting above the 5 percent threshold needed to win seats in parliament on election night.

Earlier this week polling results indicated The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party could have entered the German parliament the Bundestag for the first time, after a survey conducted by INSA on behalf of the respected Bild newspaper showed support for the party was growing

Such an outcome would most likely force Mrs Merkel to form a left-right 'grand coalition' with the SDP, who increased their share of the vote by one per cent to 28 per cent in the latest poll.

Although the SDP has publicly stated it does not want a grand coalition, experts believe it would probably enter into one if push came to shove.

That would doom Mrs Merkelâ€™s hopes of continuing her current coalition and stir concerns about rising German euroscepticism, though its impact on government policy would likely be limited.
