A driver who killed a motorcyclist on a roundabout as he sent a text message to his grandmother has been jailed for three years.

The judge told 26-year-old Stephen Rawlinson he had been distracted by using his mobile phone, and ‘even the time to text eight characters is the time it takes to kill a man’.

Rawlinson, a father of three, was seen driving his Ford Focus at speed seconds before it struck Nigel Earnshaw, 58, on his 125cc motorbike.

The accident happened in Saltaire (pictured), West Yorkshire. Rawlinson said he could not understand how he failed to see the motorbike and said he thought the noise he had heard when he hit Mr Earnshaw was children throwing stones at his car

Judge Jonathan Rose told him: ‘You just wiped out the machine and the man who was upon it.’

Mr Earnshaw, who was on his way to a 
night shift at Hallmark Cards, was within the speed limit and had the 
right of way on the roundabout when he was hit at around 10.30pm on 
September 5 last year in Saltaire, West Yorkshire.

He suffered a fractured ankle, developed deep vein thrombosis and died in hospital 18 days later.

Rawlinson said he could not understand how he failed to see the motorbike.

He also claimed he thought the noise he had heard when he hit Mr Earnshaw was children throwing stones at his car.

Rawlinson denied causing death by dangerous driving, but a jury  at Bradford Crown Court found him guilty.

Prosecutor Richard Clews told the 
court: ‘He was either grossly inattentive or he was, for some reason, 
grossly distracted for a considerable period of time on the approach to 
the roundabout.’

Police officers took his phone at the scene and found 
he had sent a text message at 10.28pm telling  his grandmother he would 
be with her shortly.

Rawlinson, from Bradford,  denied using the phone while he was driving.

Mr Earnshaw, a devoted charity 
fundraiser from Keighley, West Yorkshire, left behind Susan, his wife of
38 years. The couple had been teenage sweethearts. Judge Rose said Mrs 
Earnshaw ‘suffered a daily loneliness’ since the death of her husband, 
and had been deprived of her friend, companion and breadwinner.

He told Rawlinson: ‘There was an 
arrogance in your driving that night. You were driving too fast for the 
road, for the circumstances, too fast to respect other road users.’

Rawlinson was also banned from driving for four years and ordered to take an extended re-test before returning to the roads.

Outside court Mrs Earnshaw said: ‘I 
think the sentence was a bit too lenient, but I sometimes read in the 
papers about drivers killing others and walking free, so I suppose I 
have to be grateful to the judge for jailing him.’

Mr Earnshaw’s brother-in-law Mike 
Smith said: ‘It can be difficult enough to send a text when you’re at 
home, but when you’re driving, it’s just reckless.

‘Until you are on the receiving end 
you cannot possibly realise the impact of just how dangerous driving 
while using a mobile phone is –  to understand that it can kill.’

Richard Coteau, of campaign group 
Brake, said: ‘People who text, use the web or social networking when 
driving are taking enormous risks with their own and other people’s 
lives.’

‘The sentence is somewhat irrelevant to 
Mrs Earnshaw, however, the Rawlinsons still have a son. Mrs Earnshaw no 
longer has a husband.’
