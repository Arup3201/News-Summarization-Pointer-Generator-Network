Banned: Former BBC Radio 2 DJ Sarah Kennedy has been banned from getting behind the wheel after ploughing her Mercedes into a parked car while drink-driving

Former BBC Radio 2 DJ Sarah Kennedy has been banned from getting behind the wheel after ploughing her Mercedes into a parked car while drink-driving.

Despite claiming she lost control of the car when she sneezed, the 63-year-old was more than 
two-and-a-half times the legal limit when police tested her breath after she crashed her £50,000 luxury Mercedes Benz SLK.

When police arrived at her Northamptonshire home and tested her breath following the incident, Kennedy’s breathalyser reading was 92 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath compared to the legal limit of 35mcg.

Kennedy admitted a charge of driving with excess alcohol when she appeared at Northampton Magistrates’ Court yesterday.

Bizarrely, she claimed she crashed because she suffered a sneezing fit at the wheel after driving past a field of rapeseed which had aggravated her hay fever prior to the collision on April 3.

Prosecutor Vicki Walker told the court Kennedy was driving along the A361 near Byfield, Northamptonshire, when she crashed into a car which was parked on the verge with its hazard lights on.

'The road was fairly straight and had no obstructions,' Ms Walker said.

'The occupants of the parked vehicle reported the defendant was unsteady on her feet when she got out of her vehicle.'

After the crash Kennedy offered to leave her telephone number but then drove off when the vehicle’s occupants told her they were going to call the police and she felt threatened, the court was told.

Ms Walker said officers attended 
Kennedy’s home shortly afterwards and she told them she had 
drunk two glasses of wine since she had got home.

Sarah Colby, defending, said Kennedy was 'extremely remorseful' for what had happened and said it was totally out of character.

Crash: Kennedy had been driving her Mercedes Benz SLK, similar to this model, when she hit a car parked on the verge

Ms Colby said: 'My client has had a driving licence since she was 17 years old and has never had any issue like this before.

'My client had been suffering lower back pain earlier in the day before a flight and her friend had advised her to drink two glasses of wine to loosen up the muscles before she boarded the plane.

'She then had two more glasses of wine on the flight and had then taken a train to London.'

Ms Colby said the drinks had been spaced out over a long period and her client had 'never dreamed' she would be over the limit.

Career: DJ Kennedy started her career at the British Forces Broadcasting Service (pictured), before joining Radio 2

She added: 'She decided to drive back to her home in Northants as she was missing her husband and wanted to get back home as she was worried her back would feel worse in the morning.

“Mrs Kennedy, who suffers from hayfever, was driving with the windows open past a field full of rapeseed when she suffered a sneezing fit.

'She was reaching for a tissue but before she knew it she had crashed into the parked car.

'When she got out of the car her back was giving her pain. She was in shock, they were in shock.

'She apologised for what had happened and offered to hand over her telephone number.'

Ms Colby said Kennedy decided to drive off because the victim’s partner had sworn at her.

The
 solicitor said her client had drunk three glasses of rose wine when she
 had got home and could have used this as an excuse for being over the 
limit but fully accepted that she would have been over the limit when 
she was driving.

Bench chairman Brenda Foster said: 'It was an unfortunate incident and the level of alcohol in breath was high.

'We
 have dealt with it with a slightly lower penalty because we accept the 
wine she drunk at home would have pushed the alcohol reading up.'

Kennedy,
 who was given an MBE in 2005 for services to broadcasting, described 
herself in court as retired and able to pay a financial penalty.

She was fined £400 and ordered to pay 
costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £40. She was also banned from 
driving for 22 months.

The 
former DJ quit the Radio 2 breakfast show in 2010 following a string of 
on-air outbursts and slurring her words during her programme.

She refused to comment outside court.

Presenter: Kennedy was a regular on television screens and presented ITV show Busman's Holiday in 1990

Radio and television presenter Sarah 
Kennedy is best known for her stint on early morning BBC Radio 2 show 
The Dawn Patrol, which she fronted from 1993 until September 2010.

Nicknamed
 Bunty Bagshawe, Kennedy began her career with British Forces 
Broadcasting Service, before starting at Radio 2 in 1976.

She also hosted ITV television show Game For A Laugh between 1981 and 1984, and Busman's Holiday.

She was awarded an MBE for services to broadcasting in 2005, although her career has not been without controversy.

While
 standing in for Terry Wogan in May 1999, she drew attention for 
calling fellow presenter Ken Bruce an 'old fool', and addressed a 
reverend who was a guest on the show as 'an old prune'. She said her 
behaviour
 had been down to a lack of sleep the previous night.

In
 2000, she had to apologise for suggesting that black people made good 
athletes because they were used to running away from lions.

During
 a show in August 2007 concerns were raised over her slurred speech, 
although she said this was down to a sore throat. Although she presented the following 
day's show, she then took a month off work with pneumonia.

In
 October 2007 she was warned by bosses after during piece on wearing 
visible clothing while on the roads in winter she joked she had almost 
run over a black pedestrian because she could not see him in the dark. 
'It’s lucky he opened his mouth to yawn or something and I saw him,' she
 had said.

The BBC apologised for the comment.

Her
 Dawn Patrol show had around 4.5million listeners but in September 2010,
 after she was absent for several weeks, it was announced she was to 
leave the programme, without saying goodbye to her listeners.

Prior
 to her departure her show start time was moved from 6am to 5am, and 
listeners had raised concerns that her health was being affected by the 
early starts, with allegations that she had appeared on air drunk.

However, she has publicly denied these rumours – insisting she drank only orange juice or water before her early morning show.

She also said she had come to the decision to leave her show while on holiday that August, following the departure of Terry Wogan earlier that year.

‘The rumours about me became self-perpetuating and built up into a ridiculous urban myth,' she told the Mail On Sunday in an interview published in October 2007, a month after her resignation.

She added: 'Even if I was drinking, how could I go to bed at 7pm and then be drunk 
on the radio the following morning? I have never been anything other 
than sober at work and I can’t understand why people would tell such 
hideous lies about me.’
