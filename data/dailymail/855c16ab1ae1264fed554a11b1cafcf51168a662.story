Christian Grey is famous for his penchant for kinky sex accessorised with whips, crops and floggers in his Red Room of Pain.

But actor Jamie Dornan, who plays the character made famous by author E L James in the much-anticipated film version of Fifty Shades of Grey, has admitted it's all new to him.

An S&M expert had to be called onto the set to teach the Northern Irish actor, 32, who is married with a 15-month-old baby.

Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan were interviewed by Alison Hammond on today's This Morning ahead of the release of the Fifty Shades Of Grey film in which they star

Jamie as Christian Grey is seen whipping Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele in this still from the Fifty Shades of Grey film. The actor said he had to learn the technique from a 'kink adviser'

'We had a guy called Liam who was our kink adviser,' he revealed to Alison Hammond on today's episode of This Morning.

The actor said he felt responsible for ensuring the bondage scenes with co-star Dakota Johnson were as authentic as possible, as it's these elements that have made the erotic novels a hit with people around the world.

'I probably learnt more than Dakota,' he explained. 'Anastasia is meant to be new to it all and clueless so the onus was on me to be doing things right.'

Jamie previously told British Elle that Liam was keen for him witness first hand the kind of sex that is portrayed in the film so he invited him to see the sex dungeon in his house.

The pair revealed on the ITV show what it was like to film the racy adaption of the bestselling erotic novel

Jame said sex is a big part of the film but there's also a love story between the two characters

The actor recalled: 'I went there, he offered me a beer, and they did… whatever they were into. I saw a dominant with two submissives and he became our kink adviser on the film.'

Speaking on the ITV programme, he said that sex is inevitably a big part of the movie - which opens in the UK this evening - but warned viewers will be disappointed if that's all they're expecting.

'It's hard to get away from it as it's a big part of the story so there's enough in there to keep you keen,' he explained. 

'There has to be a good story too, you need something to carry the story through and that's the love story and the two characters that resonate with people.'

Meanwhile, Dakota, 25, told Alison that she suffered for her art as in one of the sex scenes, Jamie threw her so hard onto the bed that she suffered whiplash.

'At the time she said I threw her like a piece of meat,' admitted Jamie, quipping: 'I'm just a very committed actor!' 

The pair have been busy promoting the film and attending premieres in London, Berlin and New York over the past week.

Fifty Shades of Grey, which was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, is expected to be a box office success but many of the reviews haven't been favourable so far.

Much of the criticism was directed at Jamie, with Daily Mail film critic Brian Viner saying he is not convincing as the bondage billionaire.

He said: 'As Christian, does the Northern Irishman, Dornan, pull it off? He pulls plenty off, as it happens, but not, alas, the part itself.

Dakota revealed she suffered from whiplash after Jamie threw her 'like a piece of meat' onto the bed in one of the scenes from the highly anticipated film

The pair, pictured at the London premiere, have been working hard to promote the film adaptation of the first book in the trilogy but not all the reveiews have been favourable so far

'For a 27-year-old billionaire with a hinterland supposedly about the size of Yellowstone National Park, Christian is strangely uncharismatic.

'Grey by name, grey by personality. And for a dedicated sadist he has an odd way with a whip, as if gently swatting a bluebottle that has errantly settled on Ana's bottom.'

The Mail's columnist Jan Moir said in her review: 'Yes, this Fifty Shades Of Grim might have its titillating moments, but it just goes on and on and on for no good reason before ending in an abrupt and unsatisfactory way — the very definition of bad sex, not good.'
