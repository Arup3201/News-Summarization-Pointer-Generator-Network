The BBC is too big and too left wing and should lose some of its licence fee, the Corporation’s former head of TV news has warned.

Roger Mosey claimed the BBC had wrongly kept critics of Brussels, benefits and immigration off the airwaves and veered to the left on many issues.

He said it would ‘enrich the nation’ if rival commercial broadcasters had access to some of the licence fee to take on the BBC’s dominance.

Warning: Roger Mosey, a former head of news at the BBC who oversaw the London Olympics coverage, said the Corporation had become too big and the licence fee should be shared with other broadcasters

There has been growing pressure on the BBC over the £145.50, with 70 per cent of viewers saying they want it cut or abolished.

Tory ministers have warned it could be cut or opened up to other broadcasters if the BBC cannot repair the damage to its reputation caused by the Savile abuse scandal and huge pay-offs to senior managers.

Mr Mosey, who was head of BBC Television News and oversaw the BBC’s coverage of the London Olympics, said there should be a debate about how the next licence fee settlement ‘helps pluralism and diversity’.

Writing in The Times, Mr Mosey said that while the corporation faced widespread competition in network television, its market share of 70 per cent of all news consumption on both TV and radio was something that ‘even long-term loyalists find uncomfortable’.

He suggested that while the BBC's stance of co-ordinating its editorial content across the organisation was a good thing, it can ‘lead to homogeneity’ and conformity.

Mr Mosey said: "On the BBC's own admission, in recent years it did not, with the virtue of hindsight, give enough space to anti-immigration views or to EU-withdrawalists; and, though he may have exaggerated, the former Director-General Mark Thompson spoke of a 'massive bias to the left' in the BBC he joined more than 30 years ago.

‘I share Mark's view that there was more internal political diversity in recent times, but that isn't enough unless it's evident in a wider range of editorial view on air.’

BBC-wide policies on news programmes created 'homogenity' on the right and wrong way to cover issues like benefits and immigration, Mr Mosey warned

The BBC lost £100million in a disastrous takeover of the Lonely Planet travel guide business, an internal report has revealed.

In
a damning analysis, the corporation’s governing body accused its 
commercial arm BBC Worldwide of getting ‘carried away’ with ‘highly 
optimistic’ plans to buy the struggling brand six years ago.

It
was forced to sell the business to US-based company NC2 Media at a huge
loss earlier this year, prompting an internal inquiry.

The full scale of the waste is 
£20million more than was previously thought because BBC Worldwide 
continued to inject funds into Lonely Planet despite the fact it failed 
to generate the expected profits.

The
BBC Trust report criticised the Worldwide division for being ‘too 
aggressive’ in its forecasts, saying the potential for the travel guide 
to succeed as an online venture was ‘unproven’.

Editors’ views are ‘influenced by like-minded peers’ and co-ordination of policies across programmes can lead to homogeneity, he warned.

‘That can be intensified by regulation that sees there being “right” and “wrong” answers.

‘The BBC Trust speaks the language of diversity but in its edicts it promotes conformity, whether it’s about an agreed approach to the science of climate change, “correct” terminology in the Middle East or the way a documentary about benefits should be constructed.’

Mr Mosey said this was not an argument to take a ‘wrecking ball’ to the corporation, but to examine how the licence fee can bring about diversity in broadcasting.

He pointed to a past attempt by Channel 4 to launch a radio service to rival the BBC.

‘If that couldn't work as a commercial enterprise, might it enrich the nation if similar bids were open to funding by the licence fee?

‘A properly resourced service independent of the BBC could provide bracing competition and increase choice for audiences.’

He called for the BBC to still have the ‘dominant slice of the licence-fee pie’, but added: ‘The hard question for the corporation is why in a digital age it should have the whole pie to itself forever - when doing something different might be better for the public good.’

This week BBC Director General Lord Hall warned the BBC must end its big spending culture and return to the low-pay era of Morecambe and Wise.

He said staff had to get used to the idea of spending
the licence fee money ‘as if it were our own’ and not an endless supply
of cash.

He said BBC employees also had to remember their job was to provide programmes which could not be found anywhere else.

Culture: Lord Hall said staff at the BBC had to treat the licence fee as if it were their own money

It is thought stars like Graham Norton and Gary Lineker both earn about £1.5million a year at the BBC.

But
Lord Hall called for a return to the culture of the 1970s and 1980s, 
when the BBC had a reputation for being tight with money and paying in 
‘small cheques’.

Speaking
at the CBI annual conference in London, he said: ‘We are owned by 
householders who pay the licence fee in this country and we have got to 
remember that every time we spend money.

‘There
was a Morecambe and Wise sketch on quite regularly in the 70s and 80s 
on the BBC, where Wise would say to Morecambe “Nice suit”.

‘And Morecambe would say to Wise “It’s a BBC suit - small check”. It still works.'
