Emmanuel Adebayor is expected to be fit to face Southampton on Sunday.

The Tottenham striker did not travel to Lisbon for Spurs' 2-2 draw against Benfica after suffering a gashed knee in last weekend's 1-0 defeat by Arsenal.

Adebayor also complained of an ankle knock and a sore hamstring, but is hopeful of playing on Sunday after a period of rest.

Boost: Emmanuel Adebayor is set to return to action for Tottenham's clash against Southampton this Sunday

Missing man: Spurs missed Adebayor in Lisbon where they crashed out of the Europa League to Benfica

The striker's return would be a massive boost for Spurs, given Roberto Soldado's poor recent form and their lengthy injury list.

Michael Dawson and Vlad Chiriches remain sidelined, while Kyle Walker is a major doubt with a pelvis problem and Danny Rose picked up a knee injury on Thursday night.

In doubt: Michael Dawson is definitely sidelined and there are doubts of the fitness of injured Kyle Walker too

Jan Vertonghen, however, is eligible for Sunday after serving a one-match suspension against Benfica, while Younes Kaboul and Mousa Dembele may also be fit after missing the trip to Portugal.

Speaking after his side were knocked out of the Europa League, Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood said: 'Weâ€™re hoping there might be a couple back for Sunday.

'Weâ€™ve had no-one training since the Arsenal game back at home. Possibly Dembele, Adebayor and Kaboul.'

Return: Jan Vertonghen is eligible to play after missing the match against Benfica through suspension
