Olivier Giroud is not available for Arsenal’s Champions League qualifier against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday - because the club failed to register him for the tournament.

The France striker scored against Manchester United on Saturday in his first action since breaking his leg against Everton three months ago. The 28-year-old was not expected to be available again until January but has made a surprisingly swift recovery.

All clubs had to submit their 25-man squad lists for the Champions League group stages by August 31 and Giroud sustained the injury on August 23.

Arsenal striker Giroud has recovered from an ankle injury earlier than expected

Arsenal’s doctors predicted that he would miss at least five and more likely all six of their Champions League group games and a decision was made not to include him in the initial squad list.

Arsenal need a point from their final two games and if they qualify, they will be able to make three changes, so Giroud will be able to play in the rest of the tournament.

Jack Wilshere is a major doubt for the Dortmund tie but his latest ankle injury is not expected to keep him out long-term.

Wilshere limped off against United at the Emirates and although scans revealed nothing was broken, the ankle is sprained and doctors are waiting for the swelling to reduce before making a final assessment.

Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny is also expected to miss the clash after injuring his hip in a collision with Kieran Gibbs.

To compound matters, manager Arsene Wenger was on Monday criticised by Alisher Usmanov, the Russian who owns 30 per cent of the club. ‘I like Arsene for his principles, but principles are a sort of restriction,’ Usmanov told CNBC. 

‘We need to strengthen every position. Wenger is one of the greatest coaches but he can make mistakes and as you age it is more difficult to accept one’s mistakes. Maybe it’s a problem.’
