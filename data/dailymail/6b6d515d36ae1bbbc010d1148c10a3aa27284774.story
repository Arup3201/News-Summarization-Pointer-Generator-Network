A rugby star's new wife has posted his seedy text messages to her on Twitter and put her wedding dress and £10,000 ring on eBay.

Former Wales international and British Lion Andy Powell had begged to get back together with his wife Natasha Gascoine, 25, after their marriage - which lasted just nine months - hit the rocks.

The 6ft 4in 32-year-old said Miss Gascoine was the only one who could 'handle him'.

But she refused and branded him a liar, a cheat and a scumbag before posting a series of texts between the two on her Twitter profile to shame him.

Following that, she put Valentine's cards he wrote to her and 
his rugby memorabilia up for sale for charity.

She
 is also selling a ring for £10,000, and her wedding dress for £500, 
saying: 'The sentimental value of these pieces mean little now.'

Miss Gascoine added: 'I know he would love his name being mentioned because he loves the ego boost and feeling important.'

In one of the lurid texts he tells her 'I'm in Montpellier just had a chance to bang a girl' before going on to say he'd prefer to be with his wife.

She responds by calling him a 'scumbag' and 'mummy's boy'.

In another Powell - whose nickname is 'Brain Dead' - says: 'I want you bad !! Pick me up !!'

Powell married Miss Gascoine on May 25, 2013, in Llantrisant, south Wales.  For the big day, he auctioned off two places to his wedding with proceeds going to charity.

Claims: Miss Gascoine posted this picture on Twitter accompanied with a tweet suggesting the 'real reason' Powell left Wigan Warriors

But
 by January this year the pair had broken-up and Miss Gascoine was left with a
 house full of things which reminded her of their failed relationship.

Speaking about their relationship on Twitter, Miss Gascoine
 said: 'I don't think @andypowell8 knows who he really is. He's built a 
character to fool everyone who knows him. I fell for it.'

Among the items on sale are one of the Wigan Warriors rugby league player's British and Irish Lions rugby union tops for £5.

His wedding suit is listed for £16, a British Lions top with his initials is £5, one of his Wigan tops for £10.49, a pair of his used rugby boots for £5 and Valentine's cards he has sent for 99p.

There are a total of 31 items listed on the same page, including a Maggie Sottero wedding dress for £500, wedding bands for £4,500, a Boodles engagement ring with box for £10,000, and a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes for £400,00.

Miss Gascoine said: 'To be quite frank it pains me to wear them, rather than love and enjoy them like I once did.

She is also selling Powell's clothes and love letters which she describes as 'unwanted cards from my husband'.

Powell was released by Wigan in January after playing just five games for the rugby league side after his switch from union.

In the description of the top she wrote: 'Obviously didn't get much wear out of it, so practically brand new.'

Powell is said to be close to returning to rugby union. A source close to him told The Sun: 'It's clearly been a difficult few months for Andy.'

Powell, from Brecon, played for the Cardiff Blues, Wasps and Sale Sharks during his rugby career, before crossing codes to play rugby league for the Wigan Warriors.

He won 23 caps for Wales, and toured South Africa with the British and Irish Lions in 2009.

But he was also known for his off-field problems. In 2011 was suspended after getting embroiled in a bar brawl with football fans.

In 2010 he was banned from driving for 15 months and fined £1,000 for driving the 
stolen cart along the hard shoulder of the M4 to 'get some munchies' 
from a service station at 5.30 in the morning.

Natasha Gascoine said she was getting on the 'selfie bandwagon' when posting this on Twitter

Auctioning off his wedding suit, Miss Gascoine says: 'Andy Powell wedding suit for sale. I know he would love his name being mentioned because he loves the ego boost and feeling important.

'White jacket, white trousers and White shirt he wore on his wedding day, for sale. Designed by the very talented Tony Q'aja & team.

'I don't know the exact measurements of the suit but he is: 6"4 Normally 36 waist. 34 leg 17 1/2 inch collar. Normally wears XL or XXL on top .(Good job head measurements aren't needed to be taken into consideration, because it don't think anyone on this planet has a head as big as his).

'Unwanted item now because I don't want anything to do with our wedding around me any more. The sentimental value has gone and to be honest, since being married to him I have realised how fake he really is.

'And what a great let down he has been. Money made from selling his things will go to two charities close to my heart: Women's Aid & Samaritans. Any questions please ask. Many thanks Andy Powell's Soon to be Happy, Ex wife xxx.'

The office worker was at home today with her parents in Monmouthshire, south Wales.
