Piercing through a thick blanket of white cloud, Chicago's skyscrapers rise above the dense fog which covers the city below.

While pedestrians on the streets below were unable to see the sun, photographer Peter Tsai was able to capture these spectacular images of skyscrapers, including the Willis Tower, above the clouds from the vantage point of the Hancock Observatory.

From the viewing deck 1,000ft above ground, the blue and yellow coloured lights of the towering buildings light up the fog from underneath.

The Willis Tower in Chicago stands above the fog, on June 26, as seen from the vantage point of the Hancock Observatory

Mr Tsai, 45, captured the moment on June 26 as the Windy City's famous skyline emerged from the fog.

He said: 'I spent about three and a half hours up there on this evening as the constantly moving fog would evolve the scene in front of me.'

The stunning scene was caused by an intensely moist air mass moving over Lake Michigan, which was cooler than normal in late June.

When the mass travels over the cold lake waters it causes fog, which envelops the surrounding area.

Part-time photographer Peter Tsai, 45, captured the stunning scene on June 26 as the Windy City's famous skyline emerged from the fog

Mr Tsai said: 'Early June is the time for fog here as the lake is still cooler and the warm humid air from the jet stream that pushes in creates this lake effect fog'

Mr Tsai, a part-time photographer who works in IT, said: 'Early June is the time for fog here as the lake is still cooler and the warm humid air from the jet stream that pushes in creates this lake effect fog.

'Once the lake gets a bit warmer this doesn't happen, and for this year the Polar Vortex that kept Chicago in a deep freeze seemed to extend the great phenomena for most of the month of June.'

Mr Tsai almost missed the opportunity to capture the moment however as he had just got back from a business trip to Asia.

He said: 'I had just returned that week and was driving home when I noticed the fog pushing in heavily from the lake so I decided to gamble and go up to the observatory to have a look.

'As the time-lapse shows, on an evening like this it's an amazing time where minute by minute things are changing and evolving.

'Both times I have shot great fog like this it was on a hunch, and luckily for me they have both paid off.'
