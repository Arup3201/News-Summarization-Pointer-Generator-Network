The father of Lee Rigby yesterday denounced a decision to hand his son’s murderers more than £200,000 in legal aid.

Phil McClure, 53, said it was ‘disgusting’ that the soldier’s killers, Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 23, had been granted handouts for their three-month trial at the Old Bailey last year.

He hit out at the justice system as it emerged that Adebolajo is continuing to challenge his conviction and sentence, despite losing the first stage of his appeal.

The Judicial Office has confirmed that a judge refused the Islamic fanatic permission to appeal after he considered the case on paper.

But Adebolajo has renewed applications to overturn both his conviction and sentence. His case will now be considered before a panel of Court of Appeal judges.

His continuing appeal is likely to land the taxpayer with even higher legal bills. Last night MPs called on the Lord Chancellor to prevent taxpayers’ money being used for ‘jihadi grandstanding’.

Mr McClure, a lorry driver from Oldham, is still coming to terms with the death of his 25-year-old son, who was murdered in Woolwich, South-East London, on May 22 last year.

The father of one had been returning to military barracks when Adebolajo and Adebowale used their car to knock him over before hacking him to death in front of horrified onlookers.

Adebolajo, who was sentenced in February to a whole-life term, received £138,803 in legal aid. Adebowale, who was jailed for life with a minimum term of 45 years for his role in the murder, received £73,809.36. The pair had their defence funded by the public, despite the judge making it clear Adebolajo had no legal defence and Adebowale refused to take the stand.

The total bill for barristers and solicitors was £212,613, according to Ministry of Justice figures.

But that figure is likely to grow as Adebolajo has been given the go-ahead to renew his case and Adebowale has been given leave to challenge his sentence.

Yesterday the victim’s father condemned the system. He told The Sun: ‘It’s disgusting. There wasn’t even a defence – they were on camera boasting about killing Lee. The system needs to change.’ The killers lay in wait near Woolwich Barracks and picked Fusilier Rigby because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top and carrying a camouflage rucksack. Neither has shown any remorse.

Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘This is about getting attention around the world for their vile deeds. I will be writing to the Lord Chancellor to see if there is any action we can take to stop these revolting people from abusing our system.’

His comments follow a call by Tory MP David Nuttall for a Commons debate on payments in ‘hopeless’ appeals used to promote a terrorist agenda. The Ministry of Justice said that anyone facing a crown court trial can apply for legal aid.
