Shamed footballer Marlon King has
pleaded guilty to dangerous driving after a three-car
crash which left a motorist with a fractured elbow.

The former Premier League striker admitted the charge at Nottingham Crown Court after he drove his Porsche into two other vehicles last year.

The footballer, who appeared in the dock wearing a blue suit and open-necked white shirt, changed his plea to one of guilty this morning.

Shamed: Marlon King, 33, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at Nottingham Crown Court. The ex-Wigan Athletic striker will be sentenced on May 2

A 35-year-old was airlifted to the 
Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham following the smash on the 
Lincoln-bound carriageway of the A46/A17 in Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire.

The road was closed for two and a half hours following the pile-up, which also involved a Volkswagen Polo and a Vauxhall Astra.

Judge Nigel Godsmark QC told King he would adjourn for a pre-sentence report.

Defending King, Charles Langley asked that 'alternatives' be looked at to an immediate custodial sentence. He faces a maximum of two years in prison when imprisonment he is sentenced on May 2.

Ordering an interim driving ban, the judge told King he would make 'no promises'.

The incident followed the footballer's 2009 
conviction for sexually assaulting a student in a London nightclub, for 
which he was jailed for 18 months.

The
player, who has made 469 senior appearances, was on loan to Hull from Wigan Athletic when he groped the student's bottom and then punched her in the face when he she rejected him.

He is said to have broken the 20-year-old female's nose and split her lip during the confrontation in Soho in December 2008.

King, who was released by League One side Sheffield United this year, was freed in 2010 after serving half of his sentence.

At the time of his release the 
footballer, who was told he must remain on the Sex Offenders' Register 
for seven years, vowed to clear his name and insisted he had been 
wrongfully convicted of the sexual assault.

In 2010 King lost a Court of Appeal 
challenge against his conviction for groping a young woman.

They said the prosecution had a 'strong' case against King and ruled: 'We have no doubt that this conviction is safe.'

During
 his trial, London's Southwark Crown Court heard that the striker, who 
had been celebrating his wife's pregnancy and scoring a winning goal 
earlier, launched an 'unprovoked' attack after repeatedly being 
'cold-shouldered' by women in the Soho Revue Bar.

King, from Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, claimed he was the victim of 'mistaken identity'.

It was the second stint behind bars for King, who spent five months in prison in 2002 after being caught driving a stolen BMW.

He
 returned to the pitch in September 2010 after signing a one-year deal 
with Coventry City. King agreed a three-year contract with Birmingham 
City in 2011.

He also played for Gillingham, Nottingham Forest and Watford.
