A senior Tory MP has accused two barristers at the heart of the Leveson inquiry of failing to provide ‘basic information’ to a legal watchdog investigating their affair.

Rob Wilson, Parliamentary aide to Chancellor George Osborne, has delivered a damning response to the testimony of Carine Patry Hoskins and a barrister representing advocates of draconian Press regulation, who have been revealed to have embarked on a romantic relationship.

Mr Wilson has demanded a probe into whether the relationship between the mother-of-two, who is now divorced, and David Sherborne breached professional standards and could have compromised the Leveson inquiry’s findings.

Carine Patry Hoskins, council for the inquiry, and David Sherborne have been accused of failing to give a full account of her relationship

The Bar Council advises lawyers it is ‘very unwise’ to start a relationship with an opposing lawyer because of the likely perception of a ‘danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. 

Mr Wilson said standards of conduct applying to sexual relations between barristers working at judicial inquiries should be at least as high as at adversarial court cases.

Mr Sherborne, who represented actor Hugh Grant and other celebrity victims of phone hacking, went on holiday to the Greek island of Santorini with Miss Patry Hoskins in August last year.

She was a member of the inquiry’s counsel team, charging the taxpayer fees of £218,606 between July 2011 and November 2012 for her work. She became known as ‘the woman on the left’ and received thousands of mentions on Twitter for her close attention to Mr Grant’s evidence during the 97-day inquiry.

The couple claim they simply discussed the ‘possibility of a future relationship and decided against it’ while on their Greek holiday.

Rob Wilson, Conservative MP for Reading, has demanded a probe into whether or not the pair's relationship breached professional standards

They say they changed their minds later and became a couple after the inquiry ended in December.

Mr Wilson’s response to their evidence to the Bar Standards Board, which is investigating the affair, claims Miss Patry Hoskins ‘acknowledges that she knew she would be responsible for writing sections of the Leveson report before booking and going on a holiday to Santorini with Mr Sherborne’.

The MP claims she admits she did not inform either Sir Brian Leveson or Robert Jay QC, the inquiry’s lead counsel, about the trip.

In a letter to the Bar Standards Board, he complains that in a 19-page submission, Mr Sherborne ‘does not even provide basic facts about the relationship’, including ‘when they became friends, when relations between them became (i) romantic and (ii) sexual, and when they first realised that they may end up forming a relationship...

‘Nor does Ms Patry Hoskins explain when, during the course of her involvement with the inquiry, it became apparent to her and Mr Sherborne their “friendship” had the potential to develop into a romantic relationship. I suggest the Bar Standards Board will want to establish these basic facts for the sake of completeness.’

The MP also expresses alarm at the argument that the rules which apply to lawyers taking part in a court case do not apply in a judge-led inquiry such as that headed by Sir Brian Leveson.

‘Members of Parliament and the public would be deeply concerned to learn that the legal profession considers it appropriate to attach lower standards of independence and professional conduct to the legal staff of judicial inquiries than those that would be applied to barristers, solicitors and court staff in ordinary legal proceedings,’ he writes.

The MP says depending on the Bar 
Standards Board’s verdict, it may be necessary to spell out explicit new
codes of conduct for the staff of public inquiries, including 
barristers.

In his letter, 
Mr Wilson added that it was a ‘matter of concern in itself’ that Sir 
Brian had refused to ‘even entertain the thought that the relationship 
between the barristers may have given rise to concern despite the Bar 
Council’s clear advice’.

Mr Wilson told the Mail: ‘In 50-odd pages of submissions, they didn’t even provide details about when they became friends.

‘For a member of the Leveson inquiry 
team who wrote up part of the draft Leveson report to have had an affair
during the inquiry with a barrister who has made a career out of 
opposing the Press…is a serious matter.

Mr Wilson found it worrying that Lord Justice Leveson refused to 'even entertain the thought that the relationship between the barristers may have given rise to concern despite the Bar Council¿s clear advice'

'The Bar Standards Board needs to get to the truth about what happened and when.’ 

Sir Brian has flatly rejected any suggestion that his report into Press standards may have been tainted by the relationship.

The Bar Standards Board can impose punishments ranging from words of advice, fines or suspension to ultimately having a barrister struck off.
