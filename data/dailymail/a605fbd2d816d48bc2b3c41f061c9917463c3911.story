Most parents find two young children cause enough havoc to keep them occupied, but not this family, - who have 145 exotic pets.

Jamie and Michelle Mintram, from Weeting, Norfolk, share their three-bed with their two children, plus an array of unusual animals.

The family own a baby crocodile, a scorpion, two skunks, an Argentinian horned frog and two Boa constrictors - as well as more than 100 other creatures.

 Jamie and Michelle Mintram and their two children, Josh and Chloe, live with 145 exotic pets in their family home in Weeting, Norfolk

 The family's menagerie includes tortoises, snakes, giant rabbits, chameleons (pictured) raccoons, skinny pigs and a baby crocodile

Mr Mintram, holding the baby crocodile, likes lizards and snakes, but his wife prefers furrier critters

Mr Mintram takes in a lot of reptiles as rescue animals but most of the other creatures are the family's pets

Mr Mintram, 39, has a licence to look after the exotic pets and has rescued a number of his reptiles from owners who could not care for them.

But most of their staggering collection are family pets, with some of them living in their children's bedrooms.

The Mintrams hope to open up a small zoo nearby, which will mainly be made up of rescued animals. 

Mr Mintram and his wife, 32, met when they were both lab technicians 12 years ago and instantly bonded over their shared love of animals.

Since moving in together they have filled every nook and cranny of their detached house and garden with a different animal, including pigs, insects, a hedgehog and a raccoon.

Mr Mintram said: 'I have always loved reptiles, but Michelle preferred more furry animals.

Mr Mintram and his family live with around 145 animals, and shares his bedroom with some of them

'Farther back, my mum bred parrots and parakeets and was a pioneer in captive breeding. It rubbed off on me.

'I bought my first cornsnake at 11 and my collection grew from there, but I never set out to get 145 pets.

'We have so many because we are a rescue sanctuary for exotic animals, which there are not many of.'

The couple have more than 30 snakes, including the Boa constrictors, five baby pythons and cornsnakes that live in the garage along with the crocodile, monitor lizard and a shed-load of creepy crawlies.

Inside the house, every room, apart from the animal-free the living room, is jam-packed with tanks and cages from floor to ceiling.

The Mintrams share their bedroom with two baby tortoises, while their children also house animals in their rooms.

Eight-year-old Josh has three chinchillas living in his room, while Chloe, six, shares her room with a pink cornsnake and a yellow budgie.

The Mintrams have to clean the house once a day to stop the house from smelling, which was an impossible task on the one occasion that the skunks sprayed their bedroom

Their house may look normal from the outside, but the Mintram family home houses 145 creatures

'It's nothing unusual for [the children] to see me coming home with a raccoon or a crocodile,' said Mr Mintram. 

The animal-mad family clean the house and gardens every day so the smell never gets too pungent, but the skunks, which have their own toilet, once sprayed in the bedroom, leaving an acrid stench for days.

Unsurprisingly, looking after so many animals can be expensive, with the food bill reaching £100 a month and Mr Mintram striking a deal with a local greengrocer to cut down the cost. 

'We also have to fork out about £250 a month for heating as many of the animals require a constant heat source,' Mr Mintram said.

'We have a number of scorpions and the shiny burrowing scorpion is always trying to sting me.

'And the boa constrictor is not the friendliest - but we wouldn't swap any of them for the world.'
