With her quintessentially '80s coiffure and flawlessly natural make-up, Princess Diana's beauty look became one of the most iconic of our times.

And now, one of her make-up artists has opened up about how Diana looked after her looks - and how women today can learn a thing or two from her.

From there, the two women forged a close working relationship and Mary helped create the signature beauty look that the world will always remember. 

Speaking to Stylist magazine, Mary, who also works with Uma Thurman and Cate Blanchett, opened up about the first time she met the Princess on the Vogue shoot.

Good routine: Mary explains that the late Princess was excellent at taking care of her skin and always ensured to take her make-up off before bed and apply it to a fresh face

Glamming up: Even for a big event, Diana liked to keep her look natural and Mary advised her to start with a moisturiser on her skin, followed by a foundation that matched her skintone exactly and to always cover the roots of her lashes with lots of mascara  

'She was just coming into her own when we first met and had just married Prince Charles,' she said. 'Her marriage seemed solid and she was just the most divine, sweet kind lady. It was a huge privilege to work with our then future Queen.' 

Describing her as 'pure magic' with the 'most incredible skin', Mary told the magazine of how she managed to coax Diana away from using blue eyeliner (anyone with blue eyes should avoid blue eyeliner at all costs, warns Mary). 

'Diana was always very open and willing with her style,' she said. 'I think as soon as we worked together she realised the power of hair and make-up and that is something that should never be underestimated. By anyone.' 

Experimental: Mary says that after their first meeting, Diana, whom she described as 'pure magic', became very open to experimenting with her hair and make-up

There were no secrets to Diana’s beauty, Mary explains, no crazy formulas or magic ingredients, just good care and attention. 

Mary told how Diana was very sensible when it came to her skin and took good care of her visage by always removing her make-up at the end of the day.

She said: 'After I started working with her, Diana did everything in moderation. She cut back on drinking so her skin was 100 per cent.'  

Mary would start with a moisturiser on her skin, followed by a foundation that matched her skintone exactly. She would use concealer to lift the eye area and finish the look with a slick of mascara (ensuring to cover the roots of the lashes too) and a light sweep of blusher and lipsick.

The make-up artist believes we should all take a few tips from Diana. 'It’s all about experimenting.  We should try new things. Whatever our age,' she added.
