Samsung is distancing itself further from Google's Android platform with the launch of the world's first Tizen smartphone.

Earlier this year, its Samsung Gear 2 became the first smartwatch to run the Linux-based software, and now it has unveiled the Samsung Z -  a 4.8-inch device that will directly compete with Google's range.

It will go on sale in Russia from July this year, before being launched in other markets - although Samsung did not confirm which countries were set to get the device, or how much it will cost.

The new smartphone will be unveiled Tuesday at the Tizen Developer Conference in San Francisco.

Most of Samsung's devices, including its flagship Galaxy S smartphones, currently use a skinned version of the Android operating system.

This means the software runs on Android, but Samsung adds its own design, menus and tools for use on its own devices.

The electronics giant has tried for years to strengthen its mobile software business as a genuine complement to its mighty device-making operations.

Its first homegrown operating system - the 2009 software named Bada  - largely flopped following a lukewarm response from app developers.

Samsung worked with Intel, and other tech firms to develop the Linux-based Tizen platform, which is open-source - meaning hardware manufacturers that use it can freely tinker with the interface.

Tizen is the platform for Samsung's Gear 2 smartwatch launched in February, but the Samsung Z will be the first phone to use the operating system.

It can run Android apps when used with certain software elements, but Samsung is hoping developers will create native Tizen apps, too.

'The Samsung Z integrates the power and adaptability of the Tizen platform, enabling users to browse the web faster and utilize applications more effectively,' D.J. Lee, Samsung's head of global sales and marketing said in a statement.

Samsung made more than 30 per cent of all smartphones sold in the world last year, nearly twice the share of its archrival Apple.

The move to Tizen is seen as being an attempt to unify an operating system across Samsung's devices.

With Tizen already used on its smartwatches, its understood the company was keen to get phones running it as well.

The operating system is also thought to provide better support for the HTML5 web language, which is increasingly becoming more popular among developers building websites.

'The Tizen platform delivers a fast, optimal performance with improved memory management,' Samsung wrote on its blog.

'The Tizen-based Samsung Z offers a faster startup time and immediate multi-tasking capabilities.

'The Samsung Z fully supports superb 2D and 3D graphic qualities, smoother scrolling and an improved rendering performance for web browsing.

'Users will also be able to enjoy safe and secure privacy protection using the built-in fingerprint sensor.'

And the company added an Ultra Power Saving Mode keeps the phone operational even when battery levels are at a minimum.

Other features, including the heart rate sensor found on the back of the phone, have been tried and tested on previous phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S4.

Meanwhile, in an attempt to get developers on board with Tizen, Samsung said it will have a special promotional programme for one year for developers on its own native app store.
