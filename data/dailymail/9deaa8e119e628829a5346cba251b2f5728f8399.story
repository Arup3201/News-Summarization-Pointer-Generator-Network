The Los Angeles Galaxy kicked off the new MLS season with a 2-0 home win over Chicago Fire on Friday, with goals from Jose Villarreal and Robbie Keane.

Villarreal put the hosts ahead in the 65th minute of a dominant performance by the Galaxy just three months after they raised their third MLS Cup trophy in four seasons.

The Galaxy are unbeaten in 17 league games at home since March 8, 2014.

The Galaxy hung a large temporary banner above the video board to honor the 2014 MLS Cup champions.

The entire MLS season was almost delayed by a strike before players agreed a new collective bargaining agreement with the League on Wednesday.
