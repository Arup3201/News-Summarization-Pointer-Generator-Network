Prime Minister David Cameron has called the charges 'excessive' and urged president Vladimir Putin to make sure those being held can come home.

The 30 were initially charged with piracy, but this has been changed to hooliganism, which carries a lesser sentence.

The Prime Minister said he had appealed to the Russian leader to 'de-escalate' the situation.

Mr Cameron told BBC Radio Devon: 
'They are not hooligans, they are protesters' although he acknowledged 
countries needed 'tough rules' to protect oil platforms.

He
said: 'Their charges have been dropped from piracy to hooliganism, but I
still think that is excessive. They are not hooligans, they are 
protesters.

'I totally 
understand that countries have to have some quite tough rules to stop 
people invading oil platforms, but I have appealed to Vladimir Putin to 
try to de-escalate this and make sure that these people can go home.'
