Some brides-to-be spend months finding their perfect venue.

When you already own a £3million hilltop retreat in the south of France, the task is somewhat easier.

Keira Knightley will exchange vows with rock star fiancé James Righton at her picturesque farmhouse, in front of guests including fellow actress Sienna Miller.

The eight-bedroom property, shielded by conifers, sits among 20 acres of vineyards and olive trees near a medieval town in Provence.

Neighbours include Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who own a 17th century manor house nearby.

Miss Knightley, 28, flew out to France earlier this week to help her mother, playwright Sharman Macdonald, with preparations for the ceremony. Miss Macdonald was seen directing operations in the grounds of the house yesterday.

It is thought the party will be an intimate affair, with fewer than 50 of the couple’s closest friends and family expected to join them for the weekend.

Yesterday bunting and a large red hammock could be seen in the garden, while a large white marquee with two peaks poked out above the tree line.

The couple have employed a catering team for the reception and 120 bottles of wine, at a cost of around £3,000, have been sourced from local vineyard Chateau Minuty. 

Entertainment will, naturally, be provided by the fellow members of 29-year-old Righton’s band, Klaxons.

One guest told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s a beautiful location for the wedding. They’re very, very lucky. It’s just the perfect time of year for it as well, they couldn’t have picked a better weekend weather-wise.’

Miss Knightley reportedly asked guests to arrive separately to avoid attracting attention. Last month she told a magazine: ‘We’re not big-wedding types. I don’t need to have all that.’

While the couple will exchange vows today, because of French law they will not be husband and wife officially until they have signed the register in Britain, which is expected to take place next week.
