Cardinal George Pell - who was hand-picked by Pope Francis to examine the Vatican's finances - has been accused of spending half a million euros (AU$740,000) of church money on lavish personal expenditures including business class flights, a personal assistant and luxury furniture for his Rome apartment.

The allegations against the Victorian-born cardinal and former Archbishop of Sydney were leaked to Italian magazine L'Espresso, published on Friday.

After moving to Rome to become the Vatican Secretariat for the Economy, Cardinal Pell vowed to save the church tens of millions of dollars a year, reports LA Times.

The allegations against the former Archbishop of Sydney were leaked to Italian magazine L'Espresso,

The newly formed position, which followed years of mismanagement, waste and scandal, gave him far-reaching powers to transform the finances of the church.

But the recent allegations say he purchased a flurry of extravagant items, such as $3600 on religious robes and $6650 on kitchen sink fittings.

The magazine also claimed the former archbishop of Sydney spent more than $5100 a month to rent an office and apartment, the latter of which he allegedly fitted with $87,000 in furniture.

He flew on a string of business class flights and pays $21,600-a-month to an Australian assistant, it is alleged.

The leaks are suspected to be the work of those inside the church who are unhappy with Cardinal Pell's increasing influence.  

Vatican spokesperson Father Federico Lombardi condemned the leaks as illegal, asserting they were 'unworthy and petty.'

'Passing confidential documents to the press for polemical ends or to foster conflict are not new, but is always to be strongly condemned, and is illegal,' he said.

In December, Cardinal Pell alleged he found millions of dollars 'tucked away' at the Vatican balance sheet.

He said it was impossible to accurately know exactly what was going on with the Vatican's finances.

He also insinuated the Italian bishops who handled the church's money were less transparent than their Western counterparts.

Comparisons have been drawn between the latest revelations and the Vati-Leaks scandal of 2012, which saw a series leaked Vatican documents alleging to expose widespread corruption make headlines around the world.

Paolo Gabriele, the former butler of Pope Benedict XVI, released private papers taken from the papal chambers.

The documents showed how Vatican contracts were awarded to favoured companies and individuals, as well as highlighting allegations of internal power struggles with the Church bank.

Gabriele was convicted of aggravated theft after police found confidential documents at his Vatican flat and arrested him in May 2012.
