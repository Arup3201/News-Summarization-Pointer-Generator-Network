Its sound, which has similarities to that of Pink Floyd, is credited with influencing the later emergence of trance, ambient and electronica.

Froese was married to artist Monique Froese from 1974 until her death in 2000 and their son was a member of Tangerine Dream from 1990 to 2006.

According to his band, Froese believed that 'there is no death, there is just a change of our cosmic address.'
