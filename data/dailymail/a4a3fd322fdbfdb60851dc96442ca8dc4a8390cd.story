An oil tycoon worth ‘tens of millions’ is establishing a ‘cheats’ charter’ for divorcing husbands by hiding his money in companies, the Supreme Court was told.

Businessman Michael Prest, 51, is supposed to be paying ex-wife Yasmin £270,000 a year - but instead is giving her just £150 a week in cash, less than the minimum wage.

And although he was previously ordered by the High Court to give her a lump sum of £17.5m and several London houses, he managed to quash that order at the Appeal Court in October by claiming the millions of pounds in cash and properties held by companies he controls should not be counted as his assets.

Battle: Michael Prest, left, is 'hiding his millions' from ex-wife Yasmin Prest after being ordered to give her a lump sum of £17.5million

Now, in a divorce case that has built up legal costs estimated to exceed £3m, Mrs Prest, 50, who has four children by her ex-husband, has appealed to London’s Supreme Court to get her hands on the fortune.

The ruling could set a precedent for countless other warring couples.

Mrs Prest is understood to still live in the £4m marital home in exclusive Bayswater, west London. Technically, her court battle is against three Isle of Man-registered companies under her husband’s control: Petrodel Resources, Petrodel Upstream, and Vermont Petroleum.

Her barrister Richard Todd QC told the court yesterday: ‘It is not hyperbole to say that this is a case where, if the companies succeed, this wife will be rendered destitute.

‘They say it is not the case that this is a “cheats’ charter”, even though it would result in Mr Prest and his companies coming away with tens of millions of pounds, while the wife is reduced to claiming benefits.

‘They say it is not a cheats’ charter because there are potentially other remedies available to the wife. We say that is not so.’

Mr Todd said although Mr Prest claimed she could simply be given shares in the companies, their whole management was so much in his hands, and he had already woven such a ‘web of deceit in respect of ownership of these shares that it would be impossible to ever work out what the position is’.

Seeking any such agreement with Mr Prest, said Mr Todd, ‘is going to result in her being led a merry dance without any reward’.

The barrister went on: ‘The husband, who is resident in Monaco, simply uses these companies as his piggy bank.

‘He is supposed to be paying Mrs Prest £270,000 per annum, but he simply chooses not to pay that.

‘The true position is that he is paying Mrs Prest £150 cash per week - £7,800 per annum - a little bit less than the minimum wage.’

Mr Todd said the businessman had also ignored orders to pay massive legal costs, although his companies were financing the four children through ‘the finest public schools with a bill exceeding £100,000 per annum’.

He said the wife had managed to identify two properties owned by the companies which arguably could be sold and the money given to her - but Mr Prest claimed they were in negative equity.

Mr Todd went on to say that if Mr Prest and his companies won the Supreme Court case, other husbands would similarly be able to dishonestly hide their assets from their wives in companies, behind a ‘corporate veil’.

If the case went Mr Prest’s way, he said, the Matrimonial Causes Act, put into law to give divorcing spouses a fair share of their assets, would be rendered useless.

He said: ‘Mr Prest has exhibited a strong desire to thwart the intentions of the court.

‘It is effectively the companies’ case that we would have a cheats’ charter.

‘It would be a simple matter to incorporate a company, or better still use a company already incorporated, in order to retain assets and make them judgement-proof in a case such as this.’

‘This would be that very cheats’ charter, it would reduce the Matrimonial Causes Act to being nothing more than a scarecrow.’

Mr Todd added that the court should ‘pierce the corporate veil’ Mr Prest was hiding his fortune behind and simply treat the companies’ assets as his.

In previous hearings in the lengthy divorce campaign, Nigerian Mr Prest had been criticised by a judge who told him he was treating the case ‘as a game’ by claiming to be £48m in debt when his Petrodel companies had a turnover of almost £2.5bn a year.

The High Court estimated his wealth to be at least £37.5m when it ordered him to give almost half that to Mrs Prest. But he then referred to ‘native’ African law in his successful appeal, claiming that under customary Nigerian law he was head of his extended family, and held his company assets in trust for them.

He met his England-born and Isle of Man-raised wife in London and they married in 1993. He was named one of the most influential black men in Britain in 2007.

Mrs Prest originally sought a payout of more than £30m and said she and the children needed £730,000 a year to cover their ‘reasonable needs’.

The case continues.
