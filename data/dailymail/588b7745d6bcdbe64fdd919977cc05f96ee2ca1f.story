Nelson Mandela's family today spoke out for the first time since his death, admitting they had ‘lost a great man, a son of the soil’.

Their statement came as it was revealed today that a funeral cortege bearing Mr Mandela's body will travel through Pretoria for three days ahead of the late South African president’s burial.

The country’s government said that the cortege will leave a morgue on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday morning to go to the Union Buildings where his body will lie in state, ahead of Sunday’s burial.

Lt Gen Temba Templeton Matanzima, a 
spokesman for the family, read a statement, which said: ‘The pillar of
the royal Mandela family is no more with us physically, but his spirit 
is still with us.

‘We have 
lost a great man, a son of the soil whose greatness in our family was in
the simplicity of his nature in our midst - a caring family leader who 
made time for all… we will miss him dearly.’

Overwhelming
crowds and a host of world leaders are expected to attend services 
honouring Mr Mandela, who died on Thursday aged 95, with hundreds 
already flocking to his home in Houghton.

Meanwhile, Downing Street confirmed today that Prime Minister David Cameron has written to South Africa's president Jacob Zuma and Mr Mandela's widow Graca Machel to express his condolences.

‘The PM paid tribute to Mandela's extraordinary grace and dignity and the example that he set not just to South Africa but to the world on his release from Robben Island, saying “he gave the world new hope that the deepest wounds can be healed and that freedom and reconciliation can triumph over division and hate”,’ a spokesman said.

‘The PM concluded: “He will forever have a distinguished place in history. It falls to all of us and future generations to learn from him and try to realise his extraordinary legacy”.’

Official services begin on Tuesday with a major memorial planned at the 95,000-capacity First National Bank Stadium - also known as Soccer City - on the edge of Soweto.

Minister in the Presidency Collins 
Chabane said he expects massive crowds far beyond the capacity, adding 
that there would be ‘overflow’ areas set up. ‘We can't tell people not 
to come,’ he said.

At Mr 
Mandela's house in Houghton, hundreds of people gathered today, where 
they sang liberation songs and homages to Mr Mandela.

They walked through Houghton’s streets past expansive, stately homes carrying bundles of flowers and images of Mr Mandela. One young girl carried flowers torn from a garden, weeds included.

bore the number 4664, Mr Mandela's former inmate number, while his right
eye said Madiba, his clan name.

Ms Ncayiyana, a pharmacist, said she planned to drive the painting's artist to Pretoria so he could make a painting of the leader's body lying in state.

‘It's my way of contributing to Madiba's legacy. He's gone, but his spirit lives on,’ she said.

As the chanting and cheering behind her grew louder, she raised her voice to add: ‘If you see someone you can help, it doesn't cost anything. ... That's what he taught us.’

Those planning Mr Mandela's funeral include the former president's family, the federal government, the military and the African National Congress political party.

Despite some prior planning by authorities as Mr Mandela grew frail and suffered bouts of hospitalisation in recent years, many of the details remain up in the air.

It was unclear which ceremony world leaders will attend, either Tuesday's stadium memorial or the planned funeral service on December 15 in Qunu, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate's rural hometown in Eastern Cape Province.

Mr Chabane said South African officials were briefing diplomats Saturday about the arrangements.

US President Barack Obama and his two predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, already have indicated they will attend services in South Africa honouring Mandela.

Mandela's body will not be at the stadium event on Tuesday, Mr Chabane said. His body will rest in state Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, South Africa's capital.

His body will held overnight those days at 1 Military Hospital on Pretoria's outskirts. Mr Chabane called on residents to line the streets to serve as an honour guard as Mr Mandela's body passes twice each day.

ANC members will hold a ceremony on December 14 at Waterkloof Air Force Base near Pretoria before Mr Mandela's body is flown to Qunu, Mr Chabane said.

Tomorrow has been declared a national day of prayer and reflection over Mr Mandela's death.

'Nelson Mandela's renowned and illustrious political life will forever remain a beacon of excellence'

Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwean President

The government has announced that a special sitting of the two houses of parliament will be held on Monday to pay tribute to Mr Mandela, the country's first black and democratically-elected president.

Tributes to the former anti-apartheid activist continued to pour in from around the globe today.

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who has been in power since his country's independence from Britain in 1980 and supported Mr Mandela's ANC during its struggle against the apartheid regime, paid his first public tribute to the deceased leader today.

Despite himself being accused by critics of increasingly authoritarian rule, Mr Mugabe praised Mr Mandela as a champion of democracy and ‘an unflinching fighter for justice.’

‘Nelson Mandela's renowned and illustrious political life will forever remain a beacon of excellence,’ Zimbabwe's state-run newspaper The Herald quoted Mr Mugabe as saying.
