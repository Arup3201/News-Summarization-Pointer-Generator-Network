A 65-year-old woman is facing charges in relation to the Costco car crash that killed a 6-year-old girl and her pregnant mother's unborn child.

Ruth Burger of London, Ontario, faces one count of criminal negligence causing death and two counts of criminal negligence causing bodily harm, reports CTV News.

The new-born baby girl died in relation to the crash after being delivered by emergency caesarean section a month before her due date after her mother and young siblings were struck by a car allegedly driven by Burger on July 25.

Victim: Addison Hall of London Ontario died after Ruth Burger allegedly crashed her car into Costco

The 
new-born, Rhiannon Bozek, died last Friday evening. Her mother, Dana 
McKinnon-Bozek, was one of six critically injured after the car reversed 
through a Costco store.

McKinnon-Bozek's children Addison Hall, 6, and Miah Bozek, 3, were also injured and Addison later died on July 27.

Police said yesterday that there were no legal grounds to charge Burger for the death of the un-born child.

'The
 definition of the Criminal Code has some stipulations that a person 
becomes a person, essentially, when it is born from its mother in a 
living state,'  London police Sgt. Amanda Pfeffer said.

Micah, 3, is still in the hospital healing from her injuries but her mother has since been released

Police say that the car that Burger crashed into Costco in reverse is undergoing 'mechanical examinations' as well.

Alcohol was not a factor in the crash and Burger has been released from custody and will appear in court on September 16.

'Having already lost one child and now a second infant, it’s devastating,' London, Ontario Police  Const. Hollywood said.

'Our thoughts are with the family,' she continued.
