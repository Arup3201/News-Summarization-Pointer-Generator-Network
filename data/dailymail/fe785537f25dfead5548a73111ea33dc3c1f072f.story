Ivan Gazidis has blasted the FA's ticket allocation policy for the Community Shield in August.

Arsenal are set to receive around 26,000 tickets for the traditional curtain-raiser at Wembley stadium on August 10, with opponents Manchester City getting the same amount.

It means that just over half of Wembley's 90,000 seats will be allocated to the two competing clubs, and chief executive Gazidis has told the Arsenal website of his disappointment over the decision.

Gazidis said: 'We are all looking forward to playing Manchester City in the Community Shield.

'However, as with the FA Cup final, we are disappointed with the official allocation of only 26,000 tickets for this match.

'This means that both clubs will only officially receive a combined total of approximately 52,000 tickets, in a stadium which has a capacity of 90,000.

'The club will implement a ticket-allocation policy which will be as fair to all our supporters as possible, but we appreciate that many of our loyal supporters will be unable to obtain tickets for this match.

'We will be explaining our position to the FA and will try our best to obtain more tickets for our supporters.'
