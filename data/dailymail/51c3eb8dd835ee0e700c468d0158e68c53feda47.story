It is still thought of as a chance 
for women to show off their good taste in fashion. So more than a few 
racegoers got the needle yesterday when Emily Wood turned up for Ladies’
 Day at Epsom sporting all-over tattoos.

While
 other women donned expensive gowns and chic headwear, Mrs Wood, 25, 
also wore a very short skirt, 6in platform shoes and facial piercings. 
But she was allowed in to the venue because her risqué look did not 
break the dress code.

In
 contrast to Royal Ascot, which requires female racegoers to wear formal
 attire and a hat, Epsom – where the Derby will be run today – is less 
strict. However, Mrs Wood – 
who attended the Derby festival meeting with husband David, 40, and 
friends – may have had a motive for showing off her body art.

The
 former pupil at £14,000-a-year Sutton High School owns a local tattoo 
parlour, where her clients include several famous footballers. Tattoos 
have been increasingly on show at Ladies’ Days in recent years, sparking
 a debate over whether they lower the tone.

Wendy
 Farrow, 50, a sales assistant from South London, said: ‘I don’t like 
these tattoos at Epsom. It spoils people’s outfits and looks a bit 
cheap. I’ve been coming here for ten years and I remember it used to be a
 more pleasant experience.

‘A lot of girls are getting drunk and being sick in the toilets. I can’t remember it being like that before.’
