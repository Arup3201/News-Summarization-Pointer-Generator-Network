Shivering and scared, these helpless puppies were dumped by a busy main road after their owner apparently failed to sell them as Christmas presents.

The five, 12-week-old English Bull Terrier cross puppies were found outside the Battersea Dogs & Cats Home's centre in Old Windsor, Berkshire, on New Year's Eve.

They had been left without any food or water and their coats were filthy.

Recovering: These puppies were found abandoned outside the Battersea Dogs & Cats Home's centre in Old Windsor, Berkshire, on New Year's Eve, after their owner apparently failed to sell them for Christmas presents

Staff at the rescue centre fear they were bred purely for Christmas presents, but did not sell in time.

Centre Manager Kaye Mughal said: 'We found the puppies in a small plastic box by our gate, so they were clearly dumped deliberately.

'Given the timing we're worried they were bred as Christmas presents by someone looking to make a quick buck, but when they failed to sell they were disposed of.

'Dumping animals without food or water near a busy main road could have disastrous consequences, but thankfully we found these pups quickly, and they’re now recovering from their ordeal.'

As they were discovered just hours before the New Year, Battersea staff decided to name them Midnight, Big Ben, Chimes, Bubbles and Fizz in recognition of that night's celebrations.

And they wasted no time getting them into the warmth, giving them food, drink and a much-needed wash.

Having been trapped in the box, the puppies were very dirty, smelly, and desperate to escape.

The festive period always has an impact on Battersea, and between 24 December and 1 January the charity’s three centres received 96 dogs and 52 cats.

They included 11 cats and 36 dogs at Battersea Old Windsor, half of which were strays.

Mrs Mughal said: 'Many of these strays are genuinely lost, but others are cruelly dumped over Christmas.

'We pick up the pieces when people buy pets as presents. By March, the tiny puppies and kittens given as Christmas presents are becoming more of a handful, they've lost their initial charm and are then given up.

'When it comes to gifts, please stick to toys or chocolates but not animals, as these puppies’ heart-breaking story can testify.'

A Battersea staff member with Big Ben: The five puppies will need to stay at the centre for at least seven days before they can be rehomed

Like all strays, the five puppies will need to stay at Battersea Old Windsor for at least seven days before they can be rehomed.

Mrs Mughal said: 'They’re all lively, fun-loving pups who will make fantastic additions to good homes.

'Fizz is a confident girl who loves a fuss, and Big Ben is her bold brother.

'Chimes is the most sensitive, while Bubbles is the shy one, and follows his affectionate brother Midnight everywhere.

'They may not have had the best start in life, but Battersea will make sure 2013 sees a change in their fortunes.'
