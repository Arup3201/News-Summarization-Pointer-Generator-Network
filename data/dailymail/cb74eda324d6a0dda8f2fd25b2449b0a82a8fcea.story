Devastated: Mick Jagger claimed to have suffered a stress disorder after the death of his partner L'Wren Scott (pictured together)

One of Britain’s most senior doctors has hit out at colleagues who diagnose rape victims and ex-servicemen with post-traumatic stress disorder at the ‘drop of a hat’.

Professor Dinesh Bhugra, a former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, suggests the condition is not a true mental illness but instead is being diagnosed as a result of the influence of ‘insurance firms and drug manufacturers’.

He claims labelling patients with the term could delay recovery and worsen the problems. 

Famous sufferers are said to include singer Barbra Streisand, who developed symptoms including panic attacks and social anxiety after forgetting the words to one of her songs while performing in New York in the 1960s.

More recently, Rolling Stone star Mick Jagger was claimed to have suffered a ‘traumatic stress disorder’ as a result of the suicide of his partner L’Wren Scott, leading to him postponing several tour dates.

PTSD comprises a number of psychological symptoms resulting from a distressing, life-threatening event. They must occur for more than one month and include anxiety, insomnia, flashbacks, nightmares, sudden angry or irrational outbursts, an ability to remember parts of the traumatic event, and an avoidance of anything that reminds the sufferer of what happened.

The term was coined in 1978 by the Vietnam Veterans Working Group, and is a more modern version of what was dubbed shell shock after the First World War.

The new label is included in the latest edition the Diagnostic And Statistical Manual, published by the American Psychiatric Association – the most influential and widely used reference tool in psychiatry.

Rather than being a cohesive, well-defined and meaningful condition such as depression, Prof Bhugra says that PTSD is merely a ‘cultural construct that is a reflection of the American healthcare system, which is dictated by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies’.

He adds: ‘In America, which gave birth both to the term PTSD and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, psychiatrists cannot be paid unless there is a diagnosis in the book, leading to a tendency to medicalise every condition.’

The vast array of triggers and degrees of severity are what has led Prof Bhugra – current president of the World Psychiatric Association – to doubt the diagnosis.

‘The term PTSD is being over-used. It is being applied loosely, and doctors are diagnosing it much more readily than they should – at the drop of a hat. People assume now that if you have a traumatic event you will get PTSD. People are looking for it. I think it is quite possible that giving a diagnosis like that would hinder recovery.

‘It may send the clinician in the wrong direction because it might be clinical depression or anxiety. The patient then gets given the wrong treatments, like psychotherapy, rather than antidepressants.’

Many argue that talking treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) help speed up recovery from PTSD. But Prof Bhugra, awarded a CBE in 2012 for services to psychiatry, is unconvinced. ‘Is CBT working because it’s tackling underlying depression? Or because it is the appropriate treatment for PTSD? We don’t know,’ he says.

‘Inevitably if you give people a label they behave according to the label. Receiving this diagnosis can reaffirm for the patient the idea that he or she remains traumatised and may therefore struggle to believe they will recover, which could become self-fulfilling.’

Prof Bhugra says he has never given a patient a diagnosis of PTSD, but does accept the distress and the existence of mental-health problems following trauma.

‘There’s no doubt some people become anxious and experience some of the symptoms described after a traumatic event, but PTSD is a ragbag of experiences, and the only symptom not otherwise described or included in other psychiatric diagnoses is flashbacks,’ he adds.

The condition is most commonly associated with soldiers returning from conflict, but it has also been linked with victims of violent crime and even women who have extremely painful experiences while giving birth.

Dr Walter Busuttil, director of medical services at Combat Stress, the organisation devoted to the mental health of returning troops, said: ‘As a diagnostic category, PTSD is useful as it determines the evidence-based treatment the patient will receive. These may not be delivered otherwise. However, labelling an individual with PTSD when it is not present can harm the patient.

‘At Combat Stress we are currently supporting more than 5,600 veterans seeking our help – of these three-quarters have a primary diagnosis of PTSD. Most have been exposed to multiple military-related psychological traumas, mainly involving combat. The diagnosis of PTSD at Combat Stress is made by a senior psychiatrist and psychologist using clinical assessment, as well as psychometric measurement.

‘Treatments are geared towards trauma-focused therapies, which are evidence-based and can reduce or altogether stop symptoms of PTSD and improve function.’
