A blushing bride was nearly left red-faced on her big day after the vicar tripped over the train of her strapless dress, almost pulling it down, and broke his arm.

Reverend Roger Scoones was about to wave the newlywed couple down the aisle when he fell over the train of Katie Stoddard's dress and landed face down on the floor.

The bride and groom immediately panicked and thought the 66-year-old vicar had suffered a heart attack at their wedding on Sunday at St Mary's Church, in Stockport, Cheshire.

The moment the vicar tripped and fell - Rev Scoones is the circled blur to the right of bride Katie Stoddard. He fell heavily and broke his arm after attempting to jump over her gown

The congregation watched in shock as Rev. Scoones was helped to his feet by stunned groom Jon-Paul before carrying on with the ceremony, despite a broken right arm.

Mr Stoddard, 31, said: 'The wedding was almost over, and we were just getting organised to walk down the aisle to the Wedding March as husband and wife.

'I think Roger must have thought he was about 20 years younger than he is because he tried to jump over the train of Katie's dress, but he tripped and fell.

The panicked couple were horrified when the vicar fell and initially thought he had suffered a heart attack

 'He completely faceplanted and just lay there for about 30 seconds, everyone thought he had had a heart attack.

'I was wondering why no one else was laughing - I couldn't help myself.

'I pulled him to his feet - but by his arm which can't have helped - and he just carried on as if nothing had happened. He is a real trooper, he did a brilliant job.'

Mrs Stoddard said 'It could have been worse' - her dress could have been pulled down at the same time

 Mrs Stoddard, an administrator, said: 'I was absolutely mortified - I don't deal well with these types of situations and was really worried. He fell and I heard this cracking sound.

'I couldn't believe what had happened, I looked down and he was just lying face down on my dress. But luckily he was okay. 

'It could have been worse though - my dress was strapless and he could have fallen and pulled it down in front of all of our guests.

'Jon-Paul and his best man helped him up and he was a bit startled, and his stole was all skewiff.

'But he carried on and welcomed us as husband and wife.'

Luckily the vicar was not seriously injured and the wedding party continued after the ceremony

Reverend Scoones was taken to hospital after the ceremony where his arm was placed in a plaster cast which will stay on for the next six weeks.

The happy couple soon recovered from the shock of the vicar's fall and enjoyed the rest of their big day

The vicar, who has been officiating weddings for 33 years, said: 'It is a shame it wasn't caught on video otherwise I would have sent it in to You've Been Framed.

'The wedding party was just about to set off down the aisle, I raised my arm to signal to the organist and as I walked behind the bride I slipped on her dress.

'I went for six and crashed to the ground of the church and fell heavily on my arm in full view of everyone.'

'Most of the congregation didn't see what happened, but those around me were shocked to see me flying through the air.

'The bride and groom were quite upset by it all, but they were looking forward to their reception.

'The groom and best man very gallantly helped me up, and I waved to the organ player and sent them on their way down the aisle as husband and wife.

'Everything had gone absolutely perfectly up until then - but apparently I was quite professional about it all.

'It was a huge shock, nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

'I just stepped on the train of the bride's dress and it just felt like stepping on ice and I slipped and went flying through the air.

'I can definitely laugh at myself though and I have certainly been laughing at myself a lot since.

'The whole wedding was beautiful and now I think it will be very memorable for a whole host of reasons.'

Mr and Mrs Stoddard (pictured with Reverend Scoones and another vicar) had a memorable day

The couple - who have been together for eight years and have children Libby, 5, and Finley, 7-months - unusually had two vicars conducting their wedding ceremony.

Roger's tumble stuck in everyone's mind and the evening speeches soon turned to jokes about whether the vicar had fallen - or been tripped by Reverend Ken Kenrick.

Mr Stoddard added: 'My best man's dad is also a vicar, so we made the choice to have two vicars at our wedding.

'But once we knew that Roger was okay, everyone soon started joking and said they saw Ken stick his leg out to trip him over.'
