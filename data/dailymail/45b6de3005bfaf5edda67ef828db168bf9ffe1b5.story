The father of a four-year-old boy allegedly beaten to death by a woman claiming to be the father's girlfriend insisted on Saturday that he is a loving father and claims that he doesn't know his son's murderer.

Myls Dobson, 4, was found unconscious in the bathtub of a Manhattan high-rise on Wednesday morning after allegedly suffering abuse at the hands his caretaker, 27-year-old Kryzie King, for three weeks.

Okee Wade, 37, who is currently in jail on a fraud charge said he doesn't know who King is and wanted to make it clear that he doesn't date transsexuals.

Okee Wade says he doesn't date transsexuals or men despite the news that his son was muredred

Tears: Myls Dobson's mother, Ashlee Dobson, center, broke down at a news conference in New York on Friday - two days after her four-year-old son was found fatally beaten in a bathtub

'Killed': Four-year-old Myls Dobson was found dead in a bathtub in Manhattan on Wednesday. The woman caring for him , Kryzie King, allegedly told police she had been burning and beating the boy

He was interviewed briefly at Atlantic County Jail and told Daily News reporters, 'I don’t know anyone named Kryzie King...They put in the paper that I was dating a transsexual,' he said.

'That’s just wrong! I like women. I don’t date men and I don’t date transsexuals,' he continued.

Wade
 didn't know the brutal details of his sons murder, he only heard his 
son had died and that he was said to have been dating a 'transgender' 
woman.

'I haven’t gotten 
any information in here. I don’t get the Daily News. All I know is what 
I’ve heard from other people,' said Wade from behind the glass partition
 of the jail.

'I was a loving father,” Okee Wade told the Daily News on Saturday.Wade, who has 13 arrests, is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday.

The
 little boy had lost 14 pounds in 18 days - leaving him weighing just 37
 pounds - after he had not been given any food since December 26, DNAinfo reported.

King
 later allegedly told police that she had beaten the boy with a belt, 
locked him outside in freezing temperatures in nothing but his underwear
 and burned him with cigarettes to discipline him.

Myls
 Dobson’s mother, Ashlee Dobson, who had lost custody of the boy in 
2012 following abuse allegations, appeared at a press conference on Friday and choked back tears.

'I always wanted the best for my son,' she said through sobs, the New York Daily News reported. 'I love my son.'

Her attorney said she and other family members had looked for Myls - but with no success.

'She
 had no idea where he was. She had no resources. She didn't know who to 
go to to. She didn't know where her son was from November until the 
present day,' her attorney, Philip Lights, said.

When 
Myls' father, Okee Wade, was 
arrested for failing to attend court on fraud charges, he called his 
girlfriend, rather than turn to any of the relatives who have been 
devastated by the boy's death.

Relatives told the Daily News that he is now on suicide watch in the New Jersey jail because, 'he can't bear it. He is so overcome.'

Kryzie King, a transgender performer whose 
real name is Janaie Jones, told police that she had been dating Myls' 
father for just a few months when he was arrested on December 19.

She
 collected Myls from a cousin's home and took him to her Midtown home on
 December 21 after Wade asked her to care of his son, she told police, 
the New York Daily News reported.

She subsequently went on to beat the 
little boy with clothes hangars and a belt - hitting his head with the 
buckle - and locked in the bathroom instead, King 
allegedly told police.

She refused to feed him and gave him his last meal on December 26, which she told investigators was his 'Christmas meal', DNAinfo reported.

When he asked for some food from McDonald's nine days later, she allegedly beat him and left him alone on the living room floor with the lights off, sources said.

She later pushed the boy onto the freezing balcony of her apartment, as he wore nothing but underwear, and left him there for at least an hour, sources said.

'I was giving him corporal
 punishment,' Jones, a transgender performer who uses the name Kryzie 
King, allegedly admitted to police, DNAinfo reported. 'I was trying to control him.'

The next day, she found him unconscious in the bathtub. Police found him with burns and 
lacerations across his arms, legs and genitals and with white foam at his mouth.

Okee Wade left his son with a baby sitter after being arrested for missing a court appearance

King initially told 
investigators that she had left him alone momentarily in the bathroom 
before she heard a 'thud' in the bathroom, and ran to find him unconscious.

She was photographed as she was led out
 of the Midtown North stationhouse on Thursday night after she was 
charged with first-degree assault and reckless endangerment. Further 
charges are pending the boy's autopsy results.

The boy's mother thought her 
son was still with his father, while the boy's aunt and uncle thought he
 was staying with cousins.

Myls had been monitored by the 
Administration for Children’s Services for about half of his life - 
eventually leading to his mother losing custody of him. The supervision 
ended in August.

The boy had been looked after his 
mother, Ashlee Dobson, now 29, in South Carolina for a few years after 
he was born in 2009, but she has mental disabilities, relatives told the
 Daily News.

They added 
that child services started an investigation into Dobson in January 2011
 after she was allegedly seen beating her son in a parking lot.

Child service investigated her for inadequate care of her child, but the claim 
was dismissed before she was investigated again in September 2011. Investigators subsequently removed Myls from her custody in 
October 2012 and his father was given custody.

'Why?
 Why? Why?' Ashlee Dobsonn asked when she was asked to identify her 
son's body, the Daily News reported. 'How could this happen?'

Her lawyer added that Myles had been taken from her because they had been living in a shelter. Her weekly visitations abruptly ended in November and she had not known where to find the boy, he said.

Police had responded to a 911 call at The
 Ritz Plaza apartment building at 235 West 48th Street and found the boy
 unconscious and unresponsive.

He was taken to Roosevelt Hospital where he was pronounced dead, police said.

'This was a tragic, tragic death of a little boy,' Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said on Thursday.

The medical examiner performed an autopsy on Thursday, but the cause of death has not yet been established, officials said.

Wade
 is in jail in New Jersey, charged with conspiracy and money laundering 
for allegedly withdrawing more than $275,000 from people's bank accounts
 at an Atlantic City casino.

He learned about his son's death from police in jail on Thursday morning.

The Administration of Children's Services is investigating.

Sources told NBC New York that the babysitter doesn't have a history of child abuse or neglect.
