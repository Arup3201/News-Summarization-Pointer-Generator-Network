A mystery consortium is drawing up plans for a four-runway airport close to Heathrow, it was claimed yesterday.

The unnamed group of British businesses has commissioned a ‘world-leading infrastructure firm’ to assess potential sites to the west and north of London which could rival, or even replace, Heathrow.

The claim came as it emerged that Cameron is to order an independent review of the future of Britain’s airports in a bid to end Coalition infighting over plans for a third runway at Britain’s only international hub airport.

Hub: The new airport would have four runways and be within easy reach of London and the midlands

Expansion: Debate has raged for years over a 3rd runway at Heathrow

Demand: It's feared Britain will be left behind without a bigger airport - but campaigners have fiercely fought Heathrow expansion plans

The Prime Minister is hoping the review will secure cross-party support and defuse a row over aviation policy that has split the Cabinet.

The consortium in the latest claims is reported to have opened talks with Chinese sovereign wealth funds over the financing of the project, which could cost between £40billion to £60billion.

It is understood experts have been asked to evaluate tracts of land which could take such a large development, with sites in Berkshire and Oxfordshire potentially in the frame.

Such a proposal would inevitably face opposition from communities and environmental groups.

In a chaotic day yesterday senior Tories appeared to contradict each other on whether the party might revisit its pledge to rule out a new runway at Heathrow.

George Osborne told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the Government needed to examine ‘all options’ for expanding airport capacity within the South East. ‘We need more runway capacity in the South East of England,’ he said. ‘Okay, then there’s a question of where it should go – Heathrow, new Estuary airport, Stansted, Gatwick? People have lots of different options. What I would say is let’s examine all the options. Let’s do it now.’

But within an hour Foreign Secretary William Hague took to the airwaves to rule out a U-turn on Heathrow. He told Sky News: ‘The circumstances have not changed, it’s important to stick to that election promise.’ The Conservative Party’s leader in Scotland also weighed in, saying a third runway at Heathrow was essential for both the UK and Scotland. Ruth Davidson said: ‘Priorities – and economic landscapes – change. In politics, you need to be big enough to change your mind.’

Last week the senior backbencher Tim Yeo issued a challenge to Mr Cameron to drop his opposition to expansion at Heathrow. Downing Street insists the Prime Minister will not back down over Heathrow, at least until after the 2015 election.

Ministers hope that an independent review will take the political heat out of the situation and force the Lib Dems and Labour to agree a consensus solution.

A report yesterday claimed an airport close to the Thames estuary might take only two years longer to build than a third runway at Heathrow. The analysis suggests that plans for a £23billion airport on the Isle of Grain, in Kent, could become a reality within 14 years.
