Juan Mata has tipped England, with their blend of youth and experience, as outsiders to win the World Cup this summer.

The Manchester United forward, expected to be in the squad of defending champions Spain, believes Roy Hodgson’s side have a shot at bringing back the most sought after trophy in world football.

‘I think they can try to reach the semi-final, final, try to win the title, because they have 23 very good players going,’ said Mata. ‘They have a good manager, so why not?

‘They have great young players and they have a talented squad for England to try to compete and to try to win it.

Home favourite: Manchester United star Juan Mata considers England an outsider to win the World Cup

Positive: Spain's Mata says there is no reason why England shouldn't be contenders under Roy Hodgson

‘For example Wayne Rooney, who is my team-mate now at Manchester United, he is a world-class player.

‘I
 think there are a lot of good teams.  Brazil, which is probably the 
favourite, and obviously Argentina, Holland, Germany, France, Italy, 
England - I think they can all try to win.’

England
 manager Hodgson has whetted the nation’s appetite for the tournament by
 selecting a host of players in their teens and early 20s who lit up the
 Barclays  Premier League last season.

Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling, 
19, Southampton’s Luke Shaw, 18, Everton’s Ross Barkley and Arsenal’s 
Alex Oxlade- Chamberlain, both 20, will be in Brazil. And Jack Wilshere 
of Arsenal, who already has 15 England caps, is still only 22. Adam  
Lallana is 26 but the Southampton midfielder is new to the England team.

These
 exciting talents will be joined by old heads Steven Gerrard, with more 
than 100 caps, Wayne Rooney, closing in on 100, and goalkeeper Joe Hart,
 who is chasing his half century.

Mata has been impressed by 
England’s youngsters in the Barclays Premier League  and believes 
Hodgson has the ability to get them firing in Brazil.

‘All of them 
are like 20, 21, 22 at the most,’  explained Mata. ‘Maybe they don’t 
have the experience, but they have the talent. What they need is a 
manager to give them confidence and Roy Hodgson does that.’

When the tournament starts on June 12, however, Mata will not have time to be concentrating on England.

Spain,
 under coach Vicente del Bosque, are attempting to make history by 
winning a fourth straight major tournament, having won the 2008 and 2012
 European Championship trophies and the 2010 World Cup.

‘It would be 
something that nobody did before,’ said Mata. ‘So if we can win this 
World Cup, winning the South African one and two European cups in a row,
 we will be the most successful national team.’

The United forward 
will also have the chance to impress his new manager Louis van Gaal. 
Mata will come face-to-face with the Holland manager, who will leave his
 post to join United after the tournament, in Spain’s opening game 
against the Dutch on June 13.

‘I’ve never met him but from everyone 
that speaks to me about him, everything is good,’ said Mata. ‘He’s a 
very experienced manager. He likes to play in an offensive way, so 
hopefully he can bring success and trophies to the club and to the 
players.’

Is the Spaniard confident United will avoid a repeat of 
last season’s catastrophic campaign when David Moyes led them to seventh
 in the league?

‘Yes, I hope so and I think so,’ he said. ‘It’s been
 a difficult year for us, for the club, but I think this season we will 
improve and we will try to win again, because Manchester United is about
 fighting for and winning  the titles.’

Mata joined United in 
January from  Chelsea at a tumultuous time, three months before Moyes 
was sacked. As the club’s record signing - £37.1million - he has a lot 
to live up to.

The 26-year-old was unable to hold down a place in 
Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea side despite being named the club’s player of 
the season in the previous two campaigns. After moving to Old Trafford, 
he has been delighted to get plenty of games under his belt in the run 
up to the World Cup. He appeared back to his best in the final six games
 of the season, scoring six goals.

‘The last three or four months for me were great,’ said Mata, speaking to laureus.com, ‘I played a lot, I scored some goals.

‘It’s
 a privilege for every player to be at Brazil, to be in the 23 that 
travel to the World Cup, so I’m looking forward to being there and 
trying my best for the team.

‘The World Cup is the most important 
competition. When you are a football player and you want to play for 
your country, you always dream to play in a World Cup.

‘This year it’s in Brazil, a proper football country, and for us it would be a dream to go there and to try to win again.’
