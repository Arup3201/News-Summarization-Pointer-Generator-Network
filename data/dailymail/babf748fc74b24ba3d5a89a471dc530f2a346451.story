A dozen of England’s World Cup-winning women’s team are to be paid for the first time following their triumph in France this month.

Twenty players in total will receive central contracts, the RFU said on Monday, and will play full-time in preparation for the Rio Olympics.

The contracts are being given to members of the England women’s sevens squad, with 12 of those having been involved in the World Cup victory, which was hailed as a watershed moment.

The decision by the national governing body will give England the best chance to maintain their success by following New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, Russia Spain and the USA in placing women on professional deals.

Gary Street’s side beat Canada 21-9 in the World Cup final on August 17, despite the fact that the players were not paid. Many of them had to quit their day jobs or take unpaid leave. The squad contained teachers, personal trainers, a plumber, a vet, a lifeguard and students. 

Now they will train five days a week at Twickenham and Surrey Sports Park in Guildford and compete in the world sevens series, in an attempt to qualify for the Olympics on behalf of Great Britain, and also play 15-a-side rugby at club and Test level.

Captain Katy Mclean said: ‘This is fantastic news for the sport and exactly what we need as an England squad to continue to be at the top of our sport.’
