Arsenal's newest signing Mesut Özil faces sky-high expectations from the fans of his new club - but he is not the only new arrival in London to be creating a buzz.

The German midfielder's girlfriend Mandy Capristo is set to be a glamorous addition to Britain's collection of footballing WAGs - with her pop star background leading to the couple being dubbed 'the German Posh and Becks'.

Mr Özil, who is of Turkish ancestry, is a devout Muslim, but his girlfriend has become a celebrity in Germany thanks to her flamboyant musical performances and participation in a dancing-themed TV show.

Together: The couple have been dating for less than a year but seem particularly loved-up

The 24-year-old footballer was signed by Arsenal on transfer deadline day this week, moving from Real Madrid for £42.5million in a bid to shore up the fortunes of the struggling North London giant.

He is expected to be accompanied by Miss Capristo, 23, who found fame as a teen performer and member of a girl band before going solo.

She will join other WAGs such as Coleen Rooney, Abbey Crouch and - most famous of all - former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham.

Mr Özil and Miss Capristo have been dating for less than a year, but are not shy about showing off their dedication to each other.

They have a joint Facebook page, on which they frequently post messages of love, erotic sketches and 'selfies' with super-imposed hearts and kisses.

The couple make a striking contrast to the likes of Gareth Bale, Özil's £86million replacement at Real, whose relationship with Emma Rhys-Jones is so relaxed and low-key that they have been compared to TV's Gavin and Stacey.

Miss Capristo's first brush with stardom came when she competed on a youth talent show, Kiddy Contest, which she won at the age of 11.

She later took part in the German edition of Popstars, and as a result became a member of the group Monrose, which sold 3million albums over four years.

The singer was named 'sexiest woman in the world' by readers of German FHM in 2010, and last year she boosted her profile by participating in Let's Dance, a TV show similar to Strictly Come Dancing.

Miss Capristo released her debut solo album Grace in April last year.

Mr Özil is one of the stars of the German national team, and has also been held up as an icon of Turkish immigrants' ability to integrate into German society.

He started his career at FC Schalke 04 before moving to Werder Bremen and then, in a €15million transfer, going to Real in 2010.

The star was Arsenal's only significant signing of the summer, and is expected to help Arsene Wenger's team challenge for their first trophy since 2005.

Mr Özil is devoutly religious, reciting the Koran before each game - and he has even taught verses from the Muslim holy book to former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo.

'I pray and my teammates know that they cannot talk to me during this brief period,' he has said about his pre-match ritual. 'I also ask Allah to grant me success. This is the secret of my success.'

He has also expressed his regret that he is unable to observe the Ramadan fast, because his job requires him to maintain peak levels of fitness at all times.
