Former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown has announced that his daughter is engaged to one of his ex-staffers.

'Big news in the Brown Family!  Arianna  and Jimmy got engaged today!! They grow up so fast Gail and I are so happy for them!' the Republican announced via Twitter.

This isn't the first time that Brown has made his daughter's personal lives public information, as he infamously said that they were 'available' during his 2010 acceptance speech.

Rising profile: Even though he was voted out of office in 2012 (seen here at a re-election rally with Senator John McCain, daughters Ayla at center right and Arianna at right), Brown is trying to re-bolster his public image

Arianna Brown has been dating Jim Hendry, both 23, since he worked in his Senate office.

New member of the family: Jim Hendry proposed to Arianna this weekend, though they will be waiting at least a year to marry

Now he works at the Department of Justice as Arianna is training to become a vetrinarian.

The proposal took place over this weekend, and according to The Boston Herald, the former Senator was in on the plan.

During a recent visit to Washington, Brown spent time with Hendry who said that he was 'working hard, I'm saving up money and paying back my school loans'.

The next day, Hendry said that he was also saving up for a ring for Arianna and Brown gave him his blessing, but he still made him wait a few days before formally giving him the go-ahead.

Since graduating from Syracuse University in 2012 and putting her modelling days behind her, Arianna has led a fairly private life.

Her father is the one to update his growing mass of supporters on her latest news, and in July that came in the form of a hospital visit.

'In DC with Arianna. She got bit by a nasty cat at her vet job. Got infected, in the hospital in VA since Monday. Had an operation last night to scrape, irrigate, tendon and bone. Unreal. Think we are past the danger,' he wrote on his Facebook page.

Brown has been growing his public fan base since being voted out of office last year, with speculation mounting that he may be trying to launch a presidential campaign in 2016.

A way with animals: Arianna, seen here with her father and their dog Koda, is training to be a veterinarian and had a run in with an infected cat bite earlier this summer that sent her to the hospital

Proud dad: Brown previously got in trouble for joking during his 2010 acceptance speech that both of his daughters were single, but that is no longer the case

The clearest indication that he is trying to boost his national profile is by attending the Iowa State Fair this past weekend with his wife Gail.

Though the state fair is a family-friendly event, it is also a breeding ground for political fodder since Iowa plays such a pivotal role in the early primary elections.

'I want to get an indication of whether there’s even an interest, in Massachusetts and throughout the country, if there’s room for a bi-partisan problem solver,' he told The Herald on Sunday.

'It’s 2013 -- I think it’s premature, but I am curious.'

Mounting speculation: Brown has said that he is mulling a presidential run in 2016, and added fuel to that fire this weekend by attending the Iowa State Fair
