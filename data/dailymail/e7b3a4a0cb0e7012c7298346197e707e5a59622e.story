Homes across Britain are forcibly having water meters installed to meet government targets to cut water usage.

Water companies are now launching a massive programme of installing compulsory water meters across areas prone to water shortage -including much of southern England.

The step, which amounts to rationing by price, could also be enforced across the rest of the country and could mean soaring bills for millions of families.

The Government hopes introducing water meters into British homes will ease 'serious water stress' in key regions

Last year the Government classed the South East as a region of 'serious water stress', where water companies were granted the power to make metered households compulsory.

Now Southern Water has announced plans to put a total of 500,000 meters in homes across Hampshire, Sussex and Kent by 2015 as drought conditions continue.

This week, the company announced some 75,000 meters will be placed in homes in Brighton and Hove over the next year.

The move by water companies is an attempt to meet government targets to cut average water use from 148 to 130 litres per person per day by 2030.

Those who use the highest levels of water will be worst affected.

This includes large families, the disabled and those who regularly water large gardens or wash their cars.

However, those who tend to use less, such as the elderly and those who live alone, could see their bills reduced.

The cost of installing a meter runs to £200 per house, a sum likely to be passed on to consumers.

Around 40 per cent of homes in England and Wales are already metered, which means more than half the population has no connection between the amount of water they use and the size of their bills.

The current system sees each household without a meter pay a fixed annual sum for their water based on their home's rateable value.

Those with a meter pay just for the water they use. It is expected that 80 per cent of households in England will pay for water using a meter by 2020.

Darren Bentham, Southern Water's director of metering, said: 'As well as helping to secure water resources for the future, metering is the fairest way to charge as people pay for what they use.

'It puts people in control of their bills.'

More than 70,000 meters have already been installed in West Sussex since 2010 as part of the company's five-year plan.

The Kent countryside is one of the areas targeted by the recent plans by Southern Water to introduce 500,000 new meters by 2015

Since the equipment was rolled out, 59 per cent of customers reported a reduction in their water bills, while 41 per cent saw an increase.

'Which?' warns that households with large families could be hit by soaring bills.

A spokesman said: 'While some can and do save money from meters, others - particularly large families - may see their bills rise if meters become compulsory.

'We want to see water companies and regulators considering the impact on all customers before making sweeping changes to the charging system.'

An 2009 independent report by regulator Anna Walker called on the industry regulator Ofwat to drive through the introduction of meters through England, starting in those areas in the South East which are considered a future drought risk.

The report says: 'A combination of significant population growth, the effects of climate change and the need to renew what is often Victorian infrastructure will put increasing pressure on both the availability and the cost of water.

'We need to tackle these challenges now, before they become major problems. The charging system can play an important role in this.'
