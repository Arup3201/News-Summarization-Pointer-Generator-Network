Manager Alan Irvine has praised West Brom starlet Liam O'Neil after his emergency full debut.

The midfielder was not initially in the squad for their 3-2 Capital One cup win over Hull but was called on after Chris Baird pulled out through illness.

The 21-year-old discovered he was starting just hours before kick-off and played a major part in Albion's victory on Wednesday.

The 21-year-old put in an impressive display and played a big part in two of West Brom's goals 

His cross led to Brown Ideye's opener and his 87th-minute corner finally fell to Gareth McAuley, who volleyed in to set up a grandstand finish.

Saido Berahino won the game a minute later as Albion stunned the Tigers to progress to the fourth round and book a trip to Bournemouth.

O'Neil had only previously made three substitute appearances for the Baggies but Irvine hailed his impact.

'Liam only found out he was playing on the afternoon of the game because Chris complained of feeling unwell,'  Irvine told the club's official site.

'I have to say I thought he was outstanding and showed us what he is really capable of doing.

'It was a superb exercise for us because we managed to get full games out of so many players who needed them.

'To get a performance and result like we did as well only adds to the satisfaction.'

O'Neil will now hope to play more regularly for the Baggies, starting with the visit of Burnley on Sunday
