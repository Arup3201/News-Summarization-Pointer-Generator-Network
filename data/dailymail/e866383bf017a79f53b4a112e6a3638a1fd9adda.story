An unusually high number of dolphins have been found washed up on East Coast beaches this summer.

From New Jersey to Virginia, more than 120 bottle-nosed dolphins have been found dead or dying on beaches since June.

The bodies are sent to the University of Pennsylvania Veterinary School for necropsy, or animal autopsy, but so far the answer to what's causing the deaths has eluded experts.

Mysterious: Virginia Aquarium Stranding Response Team members carry a deceased male dolphin on a metal stretcher from Ocean View Beach in Norfolk August 1, 2013 - their third dolphin retrieval of the day

High toll: Danielle Monaghan, Field Stranding Technician, examines a dolphin that washed ashore in Margate Thursday morning, at the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, New Jersey

The number of dolphins brought in for testing - an average of two a day - is hindering experts from getting closer to an answer, said  Bob Schoelkopf, founding director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center.

'Every year we have dolphin deaths,' Schoelkopf told Philly.com. 'We won't speculate on a cause until the lab results come back.'

A similar large number of dolphin deaths in New Jersey occurred in 1987. In that case, the cause of death was due to morbillivirus, an illness similar to human measles.

Since July 9, 21 dead dolphins have been discovered on beaches in Ocean, Cape May, Monmouth and Atlantic Counties in New Jersey.

Migration: Dolphins washing up on the beach is a common sight during this time of year as they migrate, but not in the numbers we are seeing

In New Jersey, 21 dead dolphins have been found so far this year, compared to a yearly average of 12. In Delaware, 10 dolphins have died since June, compared to a typical seasonal toll of five. In Maryland, where there is usually one death each season, four dead dolphins have been discovered.

What’s causing the deaths isn’t yet certain. The number of dolphins brought in for testing - an average of two per day - has delayed the center from getting closer to an answer, according to Schoelkopf. 

So far, necropsy reports for four dolphins in New Jersey show pneumonia as the cause of death, but Schoelkopf says more dolphins need to be tested to draw any conclusions.

The Pennsylvania Veterinary School’s reports haven’t come back yet because they the testing center is shorthanded with so many dolphin corpses coming in for testing.

'My guys are actually working their days off as well as their regular scheduled days,' Schoelkopf told CBS. 

'Not only are we feeding and caring for the seals here and the sea turtle, but we have to go and run up and down the coast picking up these dead animals.'

'It's absolutely alarming,' Susan Barco, research coordinator at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center Foundation, told Reuters.

'This is really frightening because these animals are sentinels of ocean health. Strandings have been much more common in the past few decades and we think it's an indication of the health of our ecosystem,' she said.
