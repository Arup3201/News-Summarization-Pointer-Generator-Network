A mother whose two young children were fatally stabbed dozens of times in their beds by their cardiologist father has revealed her outrage that he has been freed after just three years.

Dr. Isabelle Gaston has lambasted the court system for letting her ex-husband, Guy Turcotte, walk the streets of Montreal - and potentially practice medicine again - after killing their children in 2009.

Turcotte confessed to stabbing five-year-old Olivier 20 times and three-year-old Anne-Sophie 19 times but, a year later, a Canadian jury failed to convict him of the murders, citing mental illness.

He testified that he did not remember killing the children and had not wanted to, but that pressure of his crumbling marriage had sparked blackouts. Dr. Gaston had left him for her personal trainer.

Heartbroken: Dr. Isabelle Gaston has spoken out against her ex-husband's release from a psychiatric institution just three years after he admitted repeatedly stabbing their two young children in their beds

On Wednesday, a mental health review board deemed that, while he still posed a risk, he could be released from a psychiatric institution, the Pinel Institute, under strict rules.

He is now a free man and said he intends to re-apply for his medical license. He also said he hopes to fall in love again and have more children, the National Post reported.

In his trial, two psychiatrists for the defense testified Turcotte could not have known what he was doing, but Dr. Gaston told CNN she does not believe his claims of mental illness.

'We have a person that is
a cardiologist that never had a psychiatric incident, not at all,' she said.

'I 
have trouble to understand how someone in five hours or six hours will 
do an interview of someone and have a conclusion that he is not a danger
to society or is mentally insane.

Killer: Guy Turcotte, a Quebec cardiologist, said he blacked out at the time of the killings due to stress over his crumbling marriage. He was not convicted of the murders due to mental illness

Murdered: Three-year-old Anna-Sophie, left, and five-year-old Olivier, right, died from their stab wounds

'I have to respect [the jury's] decision but it confronts me and my values because I think they didn't do their job.'

Gaston toldÂ CTV News she has spent a 
year researching similar cases and has seen large disparities in the 
results depending on the judge, the experience of the lawyers and even 
how rich the defendant is, as it influences the quality of the defense.

She added that she now lives in fear of what her ex-husband could do next.

'What brought him to do that is still there,' she said. 'Is it going to be me? Is it going to be another woman?'

In court: The jury did not convict Turcotte in 2009 and he has been undergoing therapy ever since

Last sighting: The children had gone to Turcotte's home for a movie night. They are pictured with him on surveillance footage picking up films from a store on the night they were killed

Guy
Turcotte, who was never convicted of murder, has re-applied for his 
medical license. When he worked as a cardiologist, he never had any 
complaints brought against him.

Yet former health minister Yves Bolduc told CJAD that he doubts Turcotte will ever be able to practice medicine again. Bolduc said that in light of his actions, it is unlikely Turcotte will be able to regain his licence.

'He did something very important,' Bolduc said.

But the decision will be down to the Quebec College of Medicine.

'The
college won't accept that,' Boldus said. 'I don't want to decide for 
the college, but if you look at it, it's going to be very difficult for 
him to practice again.'

She said that she is still haunted 
by the deaths of her children, who were also covered in defensive 
wounds. Her son did not have one single fatal wound, so she knows he died a long, painful death.

'To know that my children faced the 
person that they should have trusted the most and they were left by 
themselves to die, no one holding their hand,' Gaston said as she struggled to contain her tears.

'I struggle all the days, every day of my life, and I think until I 
die I will struggle.'

The release has outraged Quebec 
residents and even the Canadian government has called Turcotte's release
on Thursday 'unacceptable'.

'We
believe that Isabelle Gaston does not deserve to live in fear of her 
children's killer and neither do victims of similar crimes across 
Canada,' said federal cabinet minister James Moore.

Prime Minster Stephen Harper's government is drafting legislation to make it more difficult for mentally ill offenders to be released from psychiatric facilities, yet it will not influence Turcotte's case.

Happier times: Turcotte, who is re-applying for his medical license, hopes to have more children

Rage: His ex-wife believes Turcotte killed their children out of revenge for her leaving him for another man

Torn apart: Dr Gaston said she lives in fear of her former husband hurting others when he is released

For
now, he has been released on conditions that he does not contact his 
ex-wife or her family, that he continues his therapy and that he lives 
at an address approved by the Pinel 
Institute. He is not taking any medication for mental illness, CNN 
reported.

The release comes after Turcotte underwent six months of regular therapy, which he said has left him less anxious, CTV reported. He said he is able to deal with stress better now.

Pierre Rochette has been overseeing his mental health for the past six months and said he is 'really satisfied' with the change in the man, and believes he does not present a short-term danger.

The Crown has filed an appeal in the case, which will be heard in the new year.
