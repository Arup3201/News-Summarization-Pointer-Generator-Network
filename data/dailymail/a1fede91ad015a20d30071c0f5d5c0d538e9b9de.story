If you find Facebook overwhelming and Twitter just too much, a new social network aims to make communication even simpler.

Emojili, set to launch later this year, will only allow its users to send emoji to each other.

Even usernames on the system will be emoji - and over 10,000 people have already signed up.

The network is already asking people to reserve their username - made up of emoji

A study in April found that the top trending word of the year, so far, 
is emoji – the small digital images used to express an idea or emotion 
in electronic communication - which are continuing to spread like 
wildfire online.

The words and phrases were plucked from among millions used online in social media, blogs and global media.

Other terms to make the list include 'futebol’, and 'ghost plane' - relating to the 
missing Malaysia Airlines plane.

'We've just passed 10,000 usernames reserved, the firm said on its Twitter feed.

'Fortunately there are more than 250,000 possible two-emoji combos, so most are still available!'

The site was set up by Londoners Matt Gray and Tom Scott, who say they were inspired by Yo, which allows users to simply send the word Yo.

'The two of us had the idea at about the same time — we weren’t sold on it until we realized that usernames should be emoji too,' Gray told Forbes.

'At that point, we burst out laughing and realized we had to build it.'

However, the pair have so far refused to say exactly how the app will work.

Emoji (selection pictured) were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online, however, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere. Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture'(e) + 'letter' (moji)

Earlier this year it was revealed Apple is working to expand the diversity of the hugely popular emoji characters for the iPhone.

Following complaints that the current character set was not diverse enough, the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them.

Because Emoji have to be displayed on different devices, they are tightly controlled by the Unicode Consortium.

At present the list of characters contains dozens of faces of people that appear to be white.

However, only two of the symbols seem to be Asian and none are black.

Since 2010 a basic list has been developed and maintained by the Unicode Consortium - a Silicon Valley-based non-profit organisation made up of major computer firms, software producers, user groups and others.

Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online.

However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere.

Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture'
 (e) + 'letter' (moji).

Icons
 are standardised and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as
 a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white
 flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji 
representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese 
curry, and sushi.

Some 
emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them 
to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could now be added.

Twitter allowed emoji to be used on its web version, as well across its apps, last month.

It does this to ensure that different devices and mobile carriers can share a basic set.

The latest disclosure came after Apple boss Tim Cook was emailed asking if the firm was going to address the issue.

The diversity of emoji was also questioned in a petition posted to DoSomething.org calling on Apple to increase the ethnic diversity found within its emoji keyboard.

'Of the more than 800 Emojis, the only two resembling people of color are a guy who looks vaguely Asian and another in a turban,' it says.

'There's a white boy, girl, man, woman, elderly man, elderly woman, blonde boy, blonde girl and, we're pretty sure, [video game character] Princess Peach.'

A petition suggested that emoji like these could be added to Apple's keyboard

'But when it comes to faces outside of yellow smileys, there's a staggering lack of minority representation.'

It added that the keyboard already offered a graphic showing a same-sex couple, and called on the company to present people with a wider range of skin tones.
