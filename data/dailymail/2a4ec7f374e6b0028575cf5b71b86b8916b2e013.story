A plasterer was kicked to death while shopping with his girlfriend's nephew in a row over 'petty name calling'.

Jonathan Fitchett, 22, was chased across a car park outside a JD Sports store in Prescot, Merseyside, and then subjected to a 'barrage of punches and kicks' while shopping for a football.

As he lay dying on the ground one of the killers boasted 'That’s how you knock someone out lad' and walked away, a court heard.

Mr Fitchett was taken to hospital with bleeding on the brain and a fractured jaw but died the next day from a brain haemorrhage.

Gerard Childs and Stephen Price, both 28, were jailed for life after being convicted of murder, at Liverpool Crown Court.

The court heard the two men were locked in a trivial feud for years with Mr Fitchett calling Childs a ‘muppet.’

A jury was told that at lunchtime on July 11 the killers spotted Fitchett in the car park of JD Sports, where he had bought a McDonalds meal and a football so he could take his girlfriend’s nephew for a kickabout in a local park.

But he bumped into Childs and a shirtless Price who chased him across the car park before flooring him. They then punched and kicked him to the head and body.

Price then leaned over the unconscious Mr Fitchett, and said: 'You won’t do that again, will you?' He was then heard to say as he walked away: 'That’s how you knock someone out lad.'

One shopper who had been on her way to the Pets at Home store saw one of the attackers 'throw a barrage of punches' in the victim’s face and described the blows as 'horrific.'

She told the jury: ' I shouted "stop it, stop it, don’t do that". Another lad ran up and kicked the other lad.

'As the lad walked away he said "that’s how you knock someone out".

'I remember somebody saying "you’re going to get nicked. It’s camera’d up". They got in a car outside JD Sports and drove off.'

Police arrived to find Mr Fitchett unconscious and motionless on his back and he died in Whiston Hospital. They arrested his two killers later after CCTV from the retail park showed the assault in detail.

Childs, a roofer of Rainhill, Liverpool and Price, of Prescot denied murder claiming it was self defence.

Price said: 'I didn’t want any of this to happen. We didn’t want anyone to die. It was just a big tragic accident. I’m f****** devastated you know.'

Childs will serve a minimum of 10 years before he can be considered for release. Price must serve 11 years.

The judge, Mrs Justice Laura Cox said: 'This is a tragic case which occurred in broad daylight on a busy retail park in the presence of shoppers and ordinary families going about their business.

'It involves the death of one young man whose loss has devastated his family and friends and the conviction for murder of two others who must now live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their lives.

'They will know only too well the grave consequences of this tragedy for them and their own family and friends.'

After the case Gary Simpson, Senior Crown Prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service Mersey-Cheshire, said: 'Jonathan Fitchett was subjected to a deadly and sustained attack by Childs and Price in a busy shopping centre.

'It happened during an extremely busy part of the day with lots of shoppers and pedestrians around who were undoubtedly horrified by the assault.

'Several witnesses confirmed that they had seen the men punching and kicking Jonathan who was unable to defend himself.

'The hard work of the Crown Prosecution Service and Merseyside Police has brought these two violent men to justice. They are now behind bars and Jonathan’s family must struggle to come to terms with their loss.'

At the time of his death Fitchett’s sister Amy Hutkowski, 24, who works as a nanny in America said: 'Jonathan was a loving young gentleman, seconds away from starting his life. He was working hard getting things ready for his own business and wanted a house and a family in his future.

'He loved to keep active, playing football and enjoyed playing golf. Not a day went by where someone would not have the pleasure of seeing Jon with his cheeky smile and an ear to listen to or a hand to help.

'He was such a caring old soul, mature, strong-headed and willing. He will remain a huge part of us all, and will be loved and missed always.'
