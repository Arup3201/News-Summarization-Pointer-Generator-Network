The six climbers missing, presumed dead on Mount Rainier in Washington state are believed to have fallen more than 3,000 feet to their deaths.

Four climbers, most of them believed to be from out-of-state, and two local guides took off on a very challenging journey on Mount Rainier on Monday.

On Saturday, aerial crews spotted climbing and camping equipment on the top of the Carbon Glacier at about 9,500 feet high.

Six climbers, including two guides, are now believed to have fallen more than 3,000 feet to their deaths while ascending Mount Rainier, a dormant volcano in Washington state

Helicopters 
detected pings from emergency beacons buried in the snow thousands of 
feet below their last known location, a national park official said on 
Saturday.

Due to dangerous conditions, rescuers say there is little they can do to find them.

'Basically
 this search has come to a tragic end, it is not viable that anyone 
would have survived,' Mt Rainier National Park Ranger Patricia Wold told Q13Fox. 'It’s one of the most dangerous areas in the park.'

The six were at 12,800 feet at last 
contact on Wednesday. 'There's not a viable chance of survival,' said Park Ranger Fawn Bauer.

Air and ground searches were suspended late on Saturday afternoon. The 
bodies won't be recovered on Sunday because they are in an extremely 
dangerous area, where snow, ice and rock fall constantly, she said.

'It would expose our rangers to pretty extreme conditions, so we are not
 able to do any kind of ground searching of that area,' she said. 'And, 
in all honesty, we may never be able to get on the ground there.'

The missing group includes four clients of Seattle-based Alpine Ascents 
International and two guides. They were due to return from the mountain 
on Friday.

Among those presumed dead are guide Matt Hegeman and 26-year-old climber Mark Mahaney of St. Paul.

Mahaney, an experienced climber who had scaled Mount Rainier at least once before was identified to KAALTV by his uncle, Rob Mahaney.

Mahaney said his brother and other nephew had flown to Seattle to await updates.

When they did not return, the climbing company notified park 
officials, Bauer said.

'The last contact with them was at 12,800 feet,' Bauer said.

Mount
 Rainier, southeast of Seattle, stands at 14,410 feet and attracts 
thousands of climbers trying to reach its summit every year.

The
 last contact the group had with the climbing company was at 6pm 
Wednesday. They were scheduled to reach the summit of Mount Rainier on 
Thursday, with a day to climb down.

The group was equipped with satellite and mobile phones.

A
 small weather front that brought snow flurries and hail to the mountain
 moved in Wednesday, Bauer said. The weather has been clear since then.

Alpine Ascents' director of programs, Gordon Janow, said he wasn't ready to release information about the climbers.

Saturday
 afternoon, rescuers spotted camping and climbing equipment at 9,500 
feet on Carbon Glacier, but there is no word at this time if the gear 
belongs to the missing party.

Last month, Alpine Ascents International lost five of the 16 Sherpa guides killed in an avalanche on Mount Everest.
