Asthe supposed end of the world passed, Nasa engineers took a photo of the sun – and were stunned to find it appeared to be winking at them.

The image, which actually reveals sunspots caused by intense magnetic activity, was taken on December 22, just a few minutes after  the Mayan doomsday prophecy proved to be wrong.

Taken by Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, it has echoes of the famous image from the 1902 French film A Trip To The Moon, which is regarded as the first  science fiction movie.

The sun appears to 'wink' as the time many believed a Mayan prophecy claimed the world would end passed

A NASA spokesperson said: 'Despite reports of an ancient Maya prophecy, a mysterious planet on a collision course with Earth, or a reverse in Earth's rotation, we're still here.'

The Mayan connection 'was a misconception from the very beginning," says Dr. John Carlson, director of the Center for Archaeoastronomy.

'The Maya calendar did not end on Dec. 21, 2012, and there were no Maya prophecies foretelling the end of the world on that date.'

The mesmerising pictures, taken by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory Satellite or SDO, show the energy thrown off by the sun in wavelengths invisible to the human eye such as X-rays and ultraviolet light.

It has allowed us new understanding of how the star works.
