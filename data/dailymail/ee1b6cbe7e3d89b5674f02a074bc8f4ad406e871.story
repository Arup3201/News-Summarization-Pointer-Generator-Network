They say the rule of a fair fight is to pick on someone your own size.

But one seagull wasn't going to let his opponents might stand in the way of a tasty meal when he swooped in on the catch of a white-tailed eagle nearly twice its size.

The bird dove in on its prey near the coastal village of Flatanger in Noway, but flew away empty handed despite its efforts.

Photographer Winfried Wisniewski, 66, was shocked by the stand off which only lasted a few minutes.

Mr Wisniewski said: 'Around 20 to 30 gulls were attracted to the area by the eagle.

They were flying around in the hope the eagle would loose its fish.Â 

This particular mew gull was surfing on the eagle's neck and looked as if the the gull was doing it for fun.

Only very few gulls dare to chase an eagle because it's too risky to attack such a big bird of prey.

In this case the eagle didn't retaliate but they sometimes do.

It's rare that the gull actually get the fish.

Mr Wisniewski from Waltrop, Germany, captured the unsuccessful attack from a nearby boat.

He also photographed a greater black-backed gull chasing an eagle out of its breeding territory.

The white-tailed eagle has a wingspan on 2.50 metres - a whole metre wider than the mew gull.
