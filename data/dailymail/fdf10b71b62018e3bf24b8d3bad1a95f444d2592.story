The high school cheerleader who was jailed for having sex with her underage girfriend has found love with an older woman.

Kaitlyn Hunt was 18 when she was arrested last May after the parents of her 14-year-old girlfriend, a fellow student at Sebastian River High School in Florida, called police over the relationship.

Hunt, who maintained she had done nothing wrong, ultimately accepted a plea deal last October and was sentenced to four months in jail and two years of house arrest and three of probation.

But she has now revealed that she is moving on - and has showed off her new girlfriend, L.T.

Moving on: 19-year-old Kaitlyn Hunt, right, who was jailed last year for her relationship with a fellow student, who was 14, has revealed she has a new girlfriend, 27-year-old 'L.T.', pictured left

Arrests: Hunt, left, was arrested after her then-girlfriend's parents found out about their sexual relationship. L.T., whose full name is LaTasha Thomas, right, also has a criminal record including drugs charges

The 27-year-old, whose full name is 
LaTasha Thomas, has her own rap sheet. In 2006, she was sentenced to 6 
months for cannabis possession, and in 2012, she was arrested for 
domestic battery.

Although 
Hunt has spoken out about her relationship for the first time this week,
 it appears that they have been close for months now as L.T. was seen 
attending court with Hunt's family last year.

Now Hunt is hoping to move forward with this relationship - and her life.

'I just want to put it all behind 
me,' Hunt said of the arrest, ABC News reported. 'I want to do the right thing, and then get it over 
with, so I can move on with my life.'

Together: L.T. also supported Hunt during some of her court appearances last year before her release

Pose: Hunt's family, who stood by her throughout the case, are supportive of her new relationship with L.T.

Hunt,
 who was on the honor role and school choir, was 18 when she started her
 relationship with another school student, who was then 14, after they 
met on the basketball team.

The relationship soon became sexual, including encounters in the school bathroom.

But when the girl's parents' learned of the relationship in May 2013, they contacted authorities, who arrested Hunt.

She was released on bail after 24 hours in the local jail on the condition she did not have any more contact with the younger girl.

She was charged with two counts of lewd or lascivious battery of a child - although her parents argued the courts and the younger girl's family were only pressing charges because of anti-gay bias.

'Victim': Hunt was arrested after the parents of her girlfriend, left, discovered their sexual relationship

Support: Hunt had the support of her family, including her father, left, who insisted the parents had only called police and that Kaitlyn was only charged because of an anti-gay bias against her

Speaking out: Her parents took her case public after they believed she was being targeted for being gay

In May 2013, she rejected a plea deal 
because she insisted she had done nothing wrong - but in August, Hunt 
defied the judge's no contact order and exchanged 20,000 text messages 
with the girl.

The messages included nude photographs and messages blaming her for telling her parents.

She
 was ordered to spend the rest of her time before her trial in jail, 
before ultimately accepting a plea deal in October. She was released in 
December and now wears a ankle monitor.

'I
 never was educated on dating laws and ages and stuff so I still was 
confused about everything,' Hunt claimed in an interview after pleading 
guilty.

'I didn't know why I was in trouble.'

In court: Hunt was initially freed on bond but went against a judge's no contact order and texted the girl thousands of times. She was ordered back to jail, where she remained until December

Speaking to News Channel 5, she expressed regret that she had never had the chance to speak to her ex-girlfriend's parents about their relationship before the arrest.

'I would have respected their wishes and I would have sat down with them and had a conversation with them and it would have been different,' she said.

However she said she did not think the girl's parents deserved an apology from her.
