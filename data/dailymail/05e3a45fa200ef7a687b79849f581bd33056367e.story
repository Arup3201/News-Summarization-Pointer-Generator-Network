Vermin: A pigeon of the kind fed by a Bolton woman, earning her a £75 fine from one of the council's plain-clothes 'education and enforcement' officers

Woman eats pasty. Woman unwraps pasty. Woman feeds tiny scrap of leftover pasty to a nearby pigeon. Woman puts packet in the bin.

So far, so ordinary. Well, at least it was – right up until the woman was issued with a £75 fine for littering.

She had the misfortune to catch the eye of a plain-clothes ‘education and enforcement’ worker from the local council, who promptly gave her a fixed penalty notice because she fed the bird.

The lunchtime encounter happened in Bolton city centre and was witnessed by Gavin Moynihan, an AA worker.

He said: ‘I was really annoyed by what happened. I could not believe it. She was putting rubbish in the bin and then just gave a bit of her pasty to the birds.

‘A man came over and told her what she was doing was against some Act and gave her a fine. I was really shocked.’

Bolton council said even though the woman had binned the wrapper correctly, her actions constituted littering because pigeons are ‘vermin’ and should not be fed.

But it has since decided that the woman’s pasty will not turn into a very expensive lunchtime treat after all.

The council received a complaint over the incident and has backed down over the fine.

‘It is not our intention to target individuals unnecessarily and issue fines where education is more appropriate,’ a spokesman said.

‘Feeding pigeons in the town centre is discouraged as the birds are vermin and seen as a nuisance to many.’

He added: ‘We will be writing to the individual with the intention of cancelling the fixed penalty notice, but would like to remind the public dropping litter is an offence and we would advise people not to encourage pigeons by feeding them.’

The council said the fine was issued by a member of its plain-clothed education and enforcement team, whose other roles include tackling fly-tipping. It stressed that feeding pigeons would still be deemed a littering offence in future.

Local shop worker Mark Schofield, 51, supported the council’s position. He said: ‘If people are fined for dropping a cigarette end they should be fined for dropping any sort of litter.’

It’s not the first time a few crumbs have proved potentially costly. In 2008, Sarah Davies was issued with a £75 fine for dropping a piece of sausage roll while feeding it to her four-year-old daughter Chloe, but a judge in Hull threw the case out.

The following year, Vanessa Kelly, 26, was fined £75 for allowing her 17-month-old son Harry to feed bread to ducks in Smethwick, West Midlands.
