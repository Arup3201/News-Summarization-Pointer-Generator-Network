A princess who made racist comments about 'killing Muslims' before stripping and assaulting staff at an exclusive party is related to senior German officer decorated by Hitler, we can reveal today.

Her Serene Highness Princess Theodora Sayn-Wittgenstein yesterday pleaded guilty to a series of crimes, including assault and disorderly conduct, at Dundee Sheriff Court.

The court heard how the princess made racist comments before assaulting first-aiders and lashing out at police when she was told to stop at a University of St Andrews Oktoberfest party.

Arriving at court in a brown wig, the princess was fined £1,000 for her actions -
 with her defence admitting her behavior had 
'brought shame on herself and her family'.

The Princess's grandfather Ludwig Ferdinand Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg joined the army aged 20 - and fought in some of the most notorious battles of the Second World War. He was awarded a Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and posthumously promoted to Oberst

Now, we can exclusively reveal the princess's aristocratic heritage - including a decorated military grandfather, a link to a Colonel who tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler, and a friendship with the British royals.

The princess's mother is Countess Yvonne Wachtmeister af Johannishus, who married Ludwig Ferdinand Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg in Barbo, Sweden, in 1975.

Her father is a huge investor in windpower - and is often seen at town hall meetings in local Bad Berleburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, trying to convince locals of the benefits of windmills upon farmland and other open spaces.

He was one of the five children of decorated soldier Ludwig Ferdinand Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg.

Born in 1910, after graduating he joined the Cavalry Regiment 18 - 'Cannstädter riding' aged 20.

The family, who reside at the estate pictured, are also friends of Princess Beatrice. The British Royal attended Princess Theodora's borther's wedding to Countess Camilla von Stauffenberg

As Commander of the reconnaissance 
detachment of the 35th Infantry Division, he won the coveted German 
Cross in Gold for bravery in the invasion of Poland in September 1939.

He fought in some of the largest Nazi
 battles of the Second World War, including the invasion of Poland, the 
Battle of Moscow and the Battle of Kursk - one of the most notorious tank battles of the conflict.

During the invasion of France, he personally destroyed a heavy French tank in close quarter combat.

He was blown to pieces by an artillery shell serving in the Ukraine in 1943 where he remains buried.

For his service, he was awarded a prestigious Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and posthumously promoted to Oberst.

According to her court papers, Princess Theodora calls this Chelsea townhouse home when she is in London. It is thought it belongs to businessman and Oxford graduate Claes Kockum

Princess Theodora has three brothers and sisters: Carl-Albrecht, Anna-Natascha and August-Frederik.

The
 youngest child's brother Carl- Albrecht married Countess Camilla von 
Stauffenberg at Amerdingen castle, near Nuremberg, Germany.

The countess is a 
relation of Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg - who famously attempted 
to assassinate Adolf Hilter in 1944.

The
 German officer and aristocrat was one of the main members of the failed
 20 July plot to remove the Nazi leader from power in a bid to crush the
 party.

For his involvement, Stauffenberg was executed by firing squad known as Operation Valkyrie.

The story was turned in to a film in 2008 - with Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise playing the Colonel.

Princess Theodora's father, pictured during the wedding of his other daughter Princess Anna in 2005, was one of five children of senior German military officer Ludwig Ferdinand Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg

The couple married in the Church of 
Amerdingen - and were joined by none other than Princess Beatrice and her partner Virgin Galactic businessman Dave Clark.

The countess works in the city - which could explain her link to Beatrice and Mr Clark.

Princess
 Theodora's sister Anna-Natascha is married to Prince Manuel of Bavaria.
 She is a German political journalist who works for Bild am Sonntag.

More generally, the Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg family can be traced back to the twelfth century.

For
 centuries the family has marked on forest land - with 13,000 ha area of
 operation is the largest private forest management in North 
Rhine-Westphalia.

The 
family seat is a castle, Schloss Berleburg - which is a stately home 
open to the public. It is thought they live in a property on the estate.

Is
 believed the family could be linked to the philosopher Wittgenstein -  
who worked primarily in logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the 
philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language.

Princess Theodora had a low profile in Germany.

She was educated at schools in Switzerland and the UK before going to St. Andrews where she studied International Relations before working in Jordan.

While she lives in Germany with her family, it is thought she stays with Chelsea businessman and Oxford graduate Claes Kockum while in the UK.

He is the CEO of Mobilize Systems - a telephonics company with bases in London, Sweden and Florida.

The businessman is thought to own a £1.2million townhouse in London's SW3.

The Princess appeared in court yesterday after a night out with University friends took a debauched turn.

Princess Theodora attended the exclusive Oktoberfest party held at Kinkell Byre every March with friends and at the end of the night she tried to climb a fence before stripping off some of her outfit.

She was taken to the first aid room - making the racist remarks before attacking a security guard and a first aider.The princess then had to be restrained by numerous security guards - before police turned up and handcuffed her.

Officers were even forced to put her in leg restraints to get her into a police car. She then lashed out at police - later telling them she did so because she 'thought she was being kidnapped'.

Fining her for her actions, Sheriff Mark Stewart QC said: 'The overwhelming impression one gets is of disorderly and violent conduct occasioned by far too much drink for someone who was unble to properly deal with that level of intake.

'I deal with you in the same way as I would deal with anyone who behaves in this way. These comments you made are unacceptable - they would cause nothing but division, concern and unhappiness.'
