Chelsea youngster Thorgan Hazard has completed a season-long loan move to German side Borussia Monchengladbach.

The 21-year-old, who is the brother of established Chelsea star Eden Hazard, has spent the last two seasons on loan at Belgium side Zulte Waregem.

He won the Belgium Player of the Year award last season and was close to breaking into the national team ahead of the World Cup.

Borussia Monchengladbach beat Schalke and Wolfsburg in the race to sign the 21-year-old.

Monchengladbach sporting director Max Eberl told Rheinischen Post last week: ‘We were always going to make an attacking signing, no matter what the situation is with Luuk de Jong and Peniel Mlapa, and this will be Thorgan Hazard.

‘We have exchanged contracts with Chelsea and we have agreed with Thorgan, we have all agreed and now just need to sign the contracts.’

Is he just there because of who his brother is?

Not quite – it looked
 like a vanity move at first but the second of four footballing Hazard 
brothers has impressed during a loan spell last season, leading him to 
this point.

What has he done to show his potential?

He won the
 Belgian player of the year award last season and narrowly missed out on
 a World Cup squad spot behind Adnan Januzaj.

During his time with loan 
club Zulte Waregem he was subject of a poaching attempt by Anderlecht 
and even briefly was named club captain in a bizarre turn of events.

Will he ever make it at Chelsea?

It’s
 proven difficult for anyone to break through at Stamford Bridge after 
loan spells. Thorgan is still a long way from being a Blues star but 
Chelsea will hope this loan can act as a platform.
