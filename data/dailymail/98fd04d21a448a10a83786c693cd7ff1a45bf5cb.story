Rob Evans was with his friend checking on crab pots

A salt water crocodile who didn't like the look of two men lurking around his muddy creek bed obviously wasn't up for negotiating his territory when he set out after them in Australia's top end.

The two fisherman who'd set out on a trip to check the status of their crab pots were minding their own business when a disgruntled visitor slipped beneath the surface of Mitchell Creek, near Darwin, before making a beeline for their boat.

Capturing the moment the croc slipped under the muddy surface was Rob Evans - a fisherman who uploaded the footage to Facebook.

He commented during the 35 second clip that the inquisitive creature was 'coming out to see us' before he flicked the engine switch on his boat and idled away in the opposite direction.

'Ah, s*** he's coming straight for us,' Mr Evan's co fisherman said when he spotted the croc.

'He's after us.'

Mr Evans wrote the trip was all 'fun and games' until their unexpected crocodile encounter in a part of the country teeming with the salt water reptiles.

The  crocodile Mr Evans estimated to be about four metres which came after he and a fisherman in Australia's top end

He said the 'little bugger' who he estimated to be about four metres long was sitting right near the float of their crab trap that they'd initially set out to check on.

'The little bugger was sitting right next to the float,' he said.

When Mr Evans quickly noticed the  speed and direction with which the crocodile was taking he quickly began motoring off in the opposite direction.

'F*** that, I'm getting out of here,' he said, before signing off  'see ya later buddy.'

The four metre crocodile was in the Mitchell Creek which runs into Darwin Harbour

A man was earlier attacked by a crocodile near Peppimenarti this month 

This latest croc encounter comes just days after a Northern Territory man told how he was taken on a 'death roll' as he hunted near a creek but managed to escape when he poked the beast in the eye.

Stephen Moreen, 20, was hunting pigs, geese and emu in Peppimenarti, 320 kilometres south-west of Darwin, in the Northern Territory, when he waded into the water to collect a water fowl a member of the group he was with had shot.

He was in a two metres of water when the crocodile struck, latching its giant jaws on to his arm. 

Mr Moreen told the ABC that at he drank some beer to numb the pain as he waited to be airlifted to the Royal Darwin Hospital.

'I wasn't too worried until I saw the scars,' he said.

'It made me cry. I'm fine, I'm alive. It could have been bad. It could have got my leg. I was about waist deep.

'I have a scratch on my back, the rest on my arm. He ripped out a bit of skin and left me with two to three holes.'
