A flagship government policy to improve care for the elderly at home so they don’t end up in hospital has been branded a ‘shambles’ by MPs.

They claim it will only save the NHS a third of the cash intended – and even that is ‘ambitious.’

The Better Care Fund is a series of locally-run schemes to boost services for the elderly at home to prevent them becoming seriously ill in A&E. 

These include making nurses and physios available at weekends, providing more home-help and installing disabled-access toilets and showers.

The policy was first announced by the Government last June but the money – £5.3 billion – will not be made available until next April.

In the meantime, local organisations called Health and Wellbeing Boards have been drawing up detailed plans setting out how they will spent their share of the pot.

Ministers hope that the scheme will ultimately save the NHS money as there will be fewer, expensive admissions to hospital.

They calculate that in its first year of running, 2015/16, it will save the health service £1billion as care at home will be so much improved.

But MPs on the Committee of Public Accounts who have been scrutinising the local plans estimate it will save just £314million.

And even that amount is ‘ambitious’, they say, as it is based on an assumption that the numbers of elderly ending up in A&E will fall by 3 per cent.

This cannot be guaranteed – regardless of how care as improved at home – as a particularly cold winter or severe flu season good lead to many more admissions.

Margaret Hodge, chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, said the planning of the Better Care Fund was a 'shambles'

MPs also claim that NHS bosses did not tell the 151 boards from the start how much money they needed to try and save.

This meant that most of their initial plans had to be torn up and started from scratch as they hadn’t taken this into account.

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chair of the Committee of Public Accounts said: ‘I am dismayed that planning for the Better Care Fund has been such a shambles.

‘The Fund will not now deliver the £1 billion savings originally expected – savings which local areas were not initially told they should collectively deliver.

‘Now local area plans forecast £314 million of savings for the NHS, which is less than two-thirds of that originally expected.

‘Furthermore the assumption that local areas can achieve a reduction in emergency admissions of 3.1 per cent is a triumph of hope over reality.

She also warned that the scheme had lost ‘credibility’ due to the delays and the fact the plans had to be re-drawn.

‘Such incompetence from Departments is unacceptable at a time when the number of people most likely to need care is rising, and overall funding is falling.’ She added.

The Mail has long called for improved care for older people at hospital and at home as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign.

Last month the Government announced further details of the Fund and promised it would prevent 160,000 needing to be admitted to hospital a year.

They also estimated that a further 2,000 patients would not need to go into care homes as services would be so good they could live independently.
