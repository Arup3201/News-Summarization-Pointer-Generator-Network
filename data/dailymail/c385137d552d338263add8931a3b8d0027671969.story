The mother of the girl abducted by Jeremy Forrest said she was grieving  because the daughter she knew ‘had died’.

She sat in the public gallery yesterday as her harrowing victim impact statement describing the breakdown of their relationship was read to the court sentencing the teacher.

In it, she said her relationship with the girl would ‘never be the same again’.

She added: ‘I feel like the daughter I know has died and I’m grieving for her and it upsets me beyond words. I feel completely useless most of the time.

15-year-old he had a sexual relationship with before abducting her

‘I feel I have failed as a parent. I can’t understand how someone could do this to my child and I had no idea.

‘I feel like the worst mother in the world, whatever anyone else says it doesn’t matter. That is how I feel.

‘Someone got to my child. I never saw it coming or saw it once it was happening.

‘I feel like part of my daughter’s childhood has been stolen from me.

‘She has aimed all her anger at me that she has to give evidence and attend court.

‘Somehow that is all my fault and she feels she cannot trust me and she has gone to live elsewhere.’

The schoolgirl and her mother sat apart and completely ignored each other on the day the sobbing teenager gave evidence.

Now 16, the girl has used Twitter to say she will wait for Forrest’s release from prison.

In January she said ‘I’ll always be 
waiting for you’ and shortly before the trial she posted: ‘After all 
this time, I’m still into you’. 

I feel completely useless most of the time. I feel I have failed as a parent. Can’t understand how someone could do this to my child and I had no idea.

I feel like the worst mother in the world, whatever anyone else says it doesn’t matter. That is how I feel.

Someone got to my child. I never saw it coming or saw it once it was happening.

I feel like part of [my daughter’s] childhood has been stolen from me. I missed her last day at school, dressing her in her party dress and seeing her off to the prom has all been taken from us.

My relationship with her will never be the same again. She has aimed all her anger at me that she has to give evidence and attend court. Somehow that is all my fault and she feels she cannot trust me and she has gone to live elsewhere.

I feel like the [daughter] I know has died and I’m grieving for her and it upsets me beyond words.

When a Twitter user asked her on 
Tuesday whether she wanted their relationship to resume, she replied: 
‘Can’t talk about that until after the trial, sorry.’

She also used the social networking 
service to criticise the prosecution at Forrest’s trial for saying her 
relationship with him was ‘not a case of Romeo and Juliet’.

She said: ‘Of course it’s not! That’s a tragedy and they both f***ing died. How moronic.’

She also disputed a court claim that 
she and Forrest had sex up to eight times a night: ‘That is  completely 
misconstrued. I’m not sure who’d have the stamina!’

She later added: ‘Honestly don’t know
whether to laugh or cry.’ The court also heard allegations of illicit 
communication between Forrest and the girl that may have allowed her to 
change her evidence.

In a police interview following her 
return to Britain, the girl suggested they had agreed to flee to France 
last September after detectives had seized her phone containing intimate
pictures of them.

But, giving evidence during the 
trial, she told the court she had effectively persuaded the teacher to 
accompany her, amid concerns she might kill herself if he did not.

Off to prison: Jeremy Forrest is led out of Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex after he was jailed for five and a half years. His victim's mother said today his crimes took her daughter away

Richard Barton, prosecuting, told the
court there was ‘material that indicates communication through a known 
third party and the police are aware of that’.

Judge Michael Lawson QC said: ‘It may be a matter that should be looked into.’

Passing sentence, the judge told 
Forrest: ‘You have contested the abduction charge raising a spurious 
defence, so that she had to give evidence, evidence very different in 
content from her original account and designed to support it.

‘She had clearly received assistance in relation to what she should say.’

A Sussex Police spokesman said: 
‘Before the judge made his comments in court today the matter had been 
raised with Sussex Police and this is being looked into. We will release
more information when it becomes available.’

Forrest’s sister sprang to his 
defence yesterday.

Carrie Hanspaul, who is a mother of three, said: ‘We 
always have been and will be behind him 100 per cent. His relationship 
with the girl has been totally misconstrued. He has been misunderstood.’

Change: Jeremy looked very serious as he was guided into a prison van this afternoon

Caught on camera: Forrest and the girl aboard a ferry from Dover to Calais last September, and she clearly still has feelings for him despite his abduction conviction

She described the case as a ‘sorry episode for all concerned’, saying Forrest was ‘very sorry for his actions’.

She also said the family hoped the failure to stop the relationship would be investigated.

‘Despite the verdict and today’s 
sentence, there are many factors in this case which need to be examined 
and addressed, including the failure to properly act on early warnings,’
she added. ‘We sincerely hope that these are sensibly looked into and 
not simply swept under the carpet.’

Mrs Hanspaul had wept in court as her character reference for her brother was read out.

She said: ‘He’s very good natured and extremely mild mannered,’ claiming depression may have contributed to his behaviour.

She added: ‘Jeremy had been in a very
difficult relationship for the last six years but didn’t want to worry 
anybody, especially our parents, with his problems. Instead he withdrew 
more and more and I believe he became more and more depressed.’

Mrs Hanspaul and Forrest’s parents, Jim and Julie, had attended every day of the trial.

His father had to be taken to 
hospital after collapsing outside the court before the verdict on 
Thursday and missed yesterday’s sentencing.
