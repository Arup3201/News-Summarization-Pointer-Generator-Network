Former Newark Mayor Cory Booker was sworn in as a Democratic senator from New Jersey on Thursday, taking the oath of office, exchanging hugs with Vice President Joe Biden and acknowledging the applause of friends and family members seated in the visitor's gallery.

Mr Booker became the second African American in the Senate, alongside Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina.

The 44-year-old was elected to fill out the term of the late Senator Frank Lautenberg, who died earlier this year.

His first day in office was a busy one. Before taking the oath of office, he and his mother met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

Minutes after being sworn in, he participated in his first roll call vote, supporting an attempt by Democrats to advance the nomination of Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C. to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Booker also was to meet later in the day with President Obama at the White House.

Booker placed his hand on his own Bible as Biden led him in reciting the oath of office.

He tweeted before the ceremony on Thursday that his Bible was one given to him by his family ahead of his 2006 swearing-in as mayor of Newark.

His oath-taking gave Democrats control of 55 Senate seats, counting two held by independents. Republicans hold 45.

Following his swearing-in ceremony, 
Senator Booker tweeted his followers: '''Its not titles that honor men 
but men that honor titles.'' Thank U NJ & all that put trust in me. 
I'll work everyday 2 honor this new office.'

Booker also made a commitment on Thursday to a newly-health conscious regime after admitting that he had 'literally eaten my way through New Jersey' on the campaign trail for the Senate.

He told the Huffington Post today that now he has taken office he would return to a more healthy regime of morning meditation, prayers and working out.
