Sunshine and blue skies warmed up large parts of Britain at the weekend, attracting picnickers, beachgoers – and even a minke whale.

The massive mammal was spotted splashing away off the coast of Cornwall, eight miles south of Falmouth harbour, by holidaymakers on a wildlife cruise.Minke whales are usually only seen near the English coast once the waters warm up, when they stay near the surface to breed.

A spokesman from AK Wildlife Cruises said: 'A magnificent minke whale appeared, and we were absolutely delighted to be able to record the first Cornish whale of 2014.
