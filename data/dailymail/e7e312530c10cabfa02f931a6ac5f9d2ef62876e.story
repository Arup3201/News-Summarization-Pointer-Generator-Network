A woman who installed a £120 covert camera to capture shocking footage of a nurse abusing her 92-year-old mother-in-law has today welcomed new health care guidance into surveillance in care homes.

The video below reveals the horrific treatment Bridie Rees suffered at the hands of the person employed to care for her.

The 92-year-old was poked, prodded, abused and taunted by staff nurse Faderera Bello.

She was subsequently jailed for four months after admitting a count of neglect at Snaresbrook Crown Court in June last year.

Mrs Rees's case makes a strong argument in favour of using surveillance cameras to keep a check on elderly relatives in care homes.

And today the health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, has published new guidance - a step in the right direction, Mrs Rees's family told MailOnline.

Bridie Rees was abused, taunted and poked by staff nurse Faderera Bello at her care home. After complaining to her family and suffering bruises, they installed a £120 covert camera in her room to check on her

Irene Rees, who is married to Bridie's son William, urged other family's to use CCTV to keep an eye on their relatives, adding the practice could also protect staff facing accusations.

'This is a step in the right direction,' Mrs Rees told MailOnline. 'But we need to see it taken a  step further.

'Care homes should be offering families the option of CCTV. I would urge all families to use CCTV.

'If we hadn't installed the camera in Bridie's room she would have continued to face that abuse. 

'There is no other way to ensure are kept safe.'

Today marks the first time the CQC has published guidance to families regarding the use of cameras in care homes and hospitals.

It comes following several high profile incidents where secret devices have been used.  

'Recording equipment can be used to monitor a place, a person, a group or an activity to gather information,' the 12-page document states.

'This can be done openly, or it can be done in secret, in which case the people being monitored are unlikely to know that they are being recorded.

'People may use video cameras to do this, but there are many other options available including hidden sound-recording equipment, or motion sensors.'

The CQC's chief inspector of adult social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, said: 'We know [the highest care] does not always happen and the anxiety and distress this causes people, either for themselves or a loved one, is simply awful.

What they discovered was shocking footage of Bello, who was jailed for four months last June after admitting a count of neglect, poking and slapping Mrs Rees, while also taunting and shouting at her

The family reported Bello and she was dismissed immediately. The video shows her telling Mrs Rees 'Shut up, shut up your mouth. Your children can't do nothing'

'For some, cameras or other forms of surveillance, whether openly used by services or hidden by families, are the answer.' 

Since staff nurse Bello, 54, from Romford, was jailed last June, Mrs Rees's family have spearheaded an 18,000-signature campaign calling for CCTV cameras in care homes.

They went to the Metropolitan Police with their covertly-filmed footage taken at the Mary Seacole Nursing Home in Hoxton, London, in the autumn of 2013. 

Recording equipment can be used to monitor a place, a person, a group or an activity to gather information,' the 12-page document states.

'This can be done openly, or it can be done in secret, in which case the people being monitored are unlikely to know that they are being recorded.

'People may use video cameras to do this, but there are many other options available including hidden sound-recording equipment, or motion sensors.'

The shocking footage showed Bello poking Mrs Rees in the face.

She also called her a 'silly woman' and said: 'I can't do anything for you'.

'Bridie was wonderful,' her daughter-in-law Irene Rees, 61, married to her son William, said. 'What happened was terrible.'

She told how Bridie, who she had known for 44 years, was 'a rascal' who loved her family, nights at the bingo and girly gossips.

'We got on so well. I felt more like a daughter than a daughter-in-law,' she said.

'She had six children, 30 grandchildren and 56 great-grandchildren.

'We called her "The Queen".'

The pair spent a lot of time at Mrs Rees's home in Hackney, London, and the family were devastated when the widow suffered a heart attack in May 2012.

Mrs Rees senior, died in May last year, at the age of 92. She had been moved to another care home in Stepney, Greater London following the discovery of what Bello was putting her through

Mrs Rees said she would like to all care homes offer families the option of using CCTV, as standard

'But it wasn't unexpected,' the younger Mrs Rees said. 'She'd been poorly for a while.

'A few months later she suffered another heart attack.'

She was treated at Homerton Hospital, Hackney, and the family - including her daughter Veronica Davies - decided upon her release to move her into a care home.

They carefully read the CQC reports for homes in the area, settling on the Mary Seacole Home and Bridie moved in around September 2013.

'None of us wanted to move Bridie but she was becoming increasingly ill,' Mrs Rees said. 'She had started to develop dementia, was forgetting things.'

The family visited her regularly and within days noticed she was upset and agitated.

She was bruised and told her daughter, 'the nurse did it'.

'Bridie told Veronica, "She punches me… the nurse punches me",' Mrs Rees said. 'She was really weak at this point and we didn't want to stress her out.

'But we knew she wouldn't lie about being punched.'

The family bought a camera off the internet, hid it in a clock and positioned it near her bed.

They viewed it a few days later and were horrified by what they say.

Mrs Rees said: 'A nurse poked her  in the face, slapped and shouted at Bridie as she cowered.

'I felt sick. "'You silly woman. I can't do anything for you", the nurse said.

'Prodding and shoving her, she manhandled poor, tiny Bridie while she screamed and sobbed.

'"Shut up, shut up your mouth', the nurse spat. "Your children can't do nothing".'

The family immediately took the footage to the care home manager and Bello was told to leave the home and subsequently dismissed.

Mrs Rees was moved to another care home in Stepney, Greater London, where she was happy.

But she died in May last year.

Mrs Rees said: 'She was always happy-go-lucky but after what happened, her hair fell out and she was stressed.'

She did not live to see Bello jailed.  

Detective Inspector Ian Fleming, from the Metropolitan Police, said: 'We are committed to safeguarding adults in our community.' 

Responding to today's guidance from the CQC, care minister Norman Lamb said: 'Cameras have helped to expose terrible cruelty and neglectful care.

'Decisions about using surveillance are extremely difficult - there is always a balance to be struck between protecting people and respecting their right to privacy - but this information will help families to the make the right choice for them.

'We are committed to preventing poor care from happening in the first place and have introduced tougher standards for inspecting care services as well as measures to shut down those that aren't up to scratch.'
