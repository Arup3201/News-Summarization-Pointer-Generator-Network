Luis Suarez has revealed he couldn't stop crying after Crystal Palace scored three goals in 11 minutes to thwart Liverpool's Premier League title bid.

Liverpool head into Sunday's final round of fixtures two points adrift of Manchester City after their 3-3 draw at Selhurst Park on Monday night.

Suarez, who was voted Footballer of the Year by the Football Writers' Association last week, was left on the Palace turf in tears after the match, and had to be consoled by captain Steven Gerrard.

'My team-mates were helping me, but I couldn't stop,' revealed Suarez, who has scored 31 goals this season.

'I play every single game from the heart and I was very sad. 'I was sad for my team-mates who have done so much. I was sad that I had missed chances.'

Liverpool finished seventh last season, but have launched an inspiring assault on the title, some 24 years after they last won England's top flight.

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, Suarez added: 'It is difficult. At the start of the season, our aim was to finish in the top four and qualify for the Champions League, so it has been good.

'But then we got into a position when we thought we could win the league, but lost against Chelsea and then that happened at Crystal Palace.'
