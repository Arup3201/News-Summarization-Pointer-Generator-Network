A tiny, timber holiday home with no running water, gas, electricity or toilet has become one of the country's most sought after properties after going up for auction for £75,000.

The Chalet - a secluded one-bedroom property which boasts an earth toilet in a neighbouring shed - is set in the idyllic North York Moors National Park.

The property offers a back-to-basics lifestyle sitting in its own 1.5-acre field and no nearby houses.

Back-to-basics: The Chalet has a small interior but no running water, electricity or gas

Estate agent Tom Watson, who has had hundreds of inquiries, said: 'The phone hasn't stopped ringing because this place is a one-off. The location is superb.

'It's close to the coast and also very private. It's the perfect rural hideaway. There are people who live in the area who don't know it is there.'

The isolated property, thought to date back to the 1930s, was bought by a couple in 1948 as a holiday home and is now owned by their grandchildren David and Philip Hopwood.

Estate agents have set the guide price range for the property in Staintondale, North Yorkshire, between £75,000 and £130,000.

Quaint: The property, which was bought as a holiday home, boasts two single bunk beds

Remote: The tiny property is set in a 1.5-acre field - and no nearby neighbours

David Hopwood said: 'My grandparents bought it 66 years ago for the family and my brother and sister and I spent every holiday there.

'Back then it was next to a working farm. We used to milk the cows and I can remember the horse-drawn plough and helping with haymaking.

'It's an idyllic place. It's a 20-minute walk through the woods to the cove at Hayburn Wyke, a couple of miles to Ravenscar Hall and you can walk or cycle on the old railway line to Scarborough, which is eight miles away.'

The family are selling the property with a guide price of £75,000 to £130,000

The shed has shuttered windows and houses a living area with a sofa bed and a kitchenette with a camping stove.

Another bedroom is furnished with bunk beds while the toilet is little more than a hole in the ground in an adjacent shed.

Living in The Chalet means homeowners will have to go without electricity and have bottled water brought specially to the site by driving through the neighbouring field.

Mr Hopwood said: 'There is no television here. It's just walking, reading and peace and quiet.

'Sometimes on an evening I'll just sit outside in the deckchair and watch the owls and look at the stars.

'The skies here have no light pollution so the stars are bright and incredibly beautiful.

'It's one of the reasons I am sad to be selling but we are getting older and it's time to let the chalet go to someone else.'

He added: 'It has been very well maintained. My dad was very practical and so is my brother, so they did most of the work, including putting a concrete floor in.

'It's very comfortable and completely dry.'

Mr Watson said: 'The idea of getting away from it all in every sense is very appealing.'

The Chalet goes for auction at The Hayburn Wyke in Staintondale on September 3 with Cundalls Estate Agent in Malton, North Yorkshire.
