A millionaire Manhattan investor who dumped his girlfriend of five years by slapping her with a restraining order says he had no choice: when he tried doing it face-to-face, they always had makeup sex.

'I attempted to break up several times and somehow was convinced not to,' hedge funder Brad Zipper said on the witness stand Tuesday as he glared at his brunette ex, 28-year-old Nicole Raef. 

Nicole Raef, 28, was handed an order of protection upon returning to her boyfriend's home in the Hamptons after a girls weekend in California. 

Happier times? Brad Zipper dumped his girlfriend of 5 years using a restraining order she said was totally unexpected

Zipper said Tuesday that he'd shared a bed with Raef just days before filing for the restraining order, reports the New York Post.

'I laid in the same bed with her at some point [on September 5],' he told the Manhattan family court.

He went on to claim he couldn't recall whether he and Raef had sex that day. Raef, however, said she remembered clearly.

'We did,' Raef said on the stand. 'We slept in until 12:30 p.m. We kind of just cuddled and laid in bed and had the TV on. I don’t think we were really watching anything, though.' 

And while she claims the restraining order took her completely by surprise, Zipper is telling a much different story.

'I was 100 percent shocked,' Raef told the New York Post. “

'I was like, "I don’t understand, who breaks up with someone this way?"'

What's worse, having been kicked out of Zipper's Hamptons home and his $4million NYC townhouse, which is located in the city's Little Italy neighborhood, Raef had nowhere to live and even had to resort to pawning her diamond earrings so she could afford a lawyer.

Raef also said that while the two had been arguing before she left, they had worked things out.

Zipper, in papers he filed, paints Raef in a much different light, and implies their relationship was incredibly tumultuous and at times even abusive.

He recalls one incident in which he returned home to find his oven on fire and Raef passed out in the guest room.

'When she woke up, she was delirious and didn’t even remember driving and getting into an accident with my car that night,' he says in the suit.

Her also claims Raef, who works in the fashion industry, threw wine bottles at his head during a party over the summer, and tossed thousands of dollars worth of his possessions into the pool at his South Hampton home. 

Raef’s attorney, Brett Kimmel, has denied all of Zipper's claims.

'This is a wealthy man breaking up with his girlfriend and doing it in a really untasteful way,' said Kimmel.

Prior to the break up, the two enjoyed a jet set life, traveling around the country and even being featured in the New York Times.

That story detailed one of the couple's nights out, having dinner with his parents in the city.
