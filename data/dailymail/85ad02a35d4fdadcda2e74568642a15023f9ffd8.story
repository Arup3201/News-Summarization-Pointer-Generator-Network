President Barack Obama says he unconditionally condemns the murder of two police officers shot in broad daylight on Saturday in New York.

Obama says there's no justification for the slayings, adding that police offers risk their own safety to serve and protect their communities and that they deserve the public's respect and gratitude.

Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were killed in broad daylight on Saturday afternoon while on duty by 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley, who crept up behind their patrol car and shot them both in the head.

Authorities say that before shooting the officers, Brinsley announced on Instagram that he planned to shoot two 'pigs' in retaliation for the police chokehold death of Eric Garner. 

Brinsley later killed himself after at a nearby subway station.

Obama is asking Americans to reject violence and harmful words at this time, encouraging people instead to embrace words that heal, and to seek out prayer and sympathy for the victims' relatives.

President Obama's comments come in a statement while he's vacationing with his family in Hawaii.

This as many are attacking him and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio as they believe the men have encouraged protesters and not shown support for police. 

Mayor de Blasio responded to these comments, saying in a statement; 'It's unfortunate that in a time of great tragedy, some would resort to the irresponsible, overheated rhetoric that angers and divides people.'
