On cold mornings, there’s nothing worse than getting out of a warm bed to turn the heating on.

But now, you don’t have to.

Honeywell’s latest smart thermostat is activated by saying ‘Hello thermostat’, and it can be controlled using commands such as ‘make it warmer’ and ‘make it much cooler.’

The thermostat will even reply and tell the homeowner what temperature its setting the room at.

The £229 Voice Controlled Thermostat (pictured) uses far field voice analysis, which means it can operate with background noise such as a TV or radio. The device is activated by saying ‘Hello Thermostat’, and commands include ‘make it warmer’ and ‘make it much cooler’

The £229 Voice Controlled Thermostat is the first thermostat of its kind in the UK, and was developed by heating experts at the Bracknell-based firm.

It uses far field voice analysis, which means it can operate with background noise such as a TV or radio.

As long as the device can hear a person's voice, it can respond.

After installation, the thermostat immediately recognises the homeowner’s voice and adjusts the temperature setting based on their request.

The device also features a touchscreen (pictured) and links to the Honeywell Total Connect Comfort app. The system is able to learn about its owner’s needs, and become smarter over time with the addition of more commands based on its interactions

When controlled using the iOS or Android app (pictured), the thermostat  can be controlled remotely. After installation, the thermostat automatically recognises the owner's voice

‘We want to explore new ways for people to interact with their home and this is a natural progression,’ said Jeremy Peterson, general manager of Honeywell’s Home Comfort and Energy Systems Division in Europe.

‘Most people know the feeling of coming through the front door with arms full of shopping bags, keys and small children only to find that their house is way too cold. 

'Or similarly, watching a film on the sofa on a chilly evening and not wanting to get up to turn on the thermostat.

‘Now people can simply speak to their thermostat and it responds by changing their heating relevant to how they feel.’

Honeywell also makes the ‘intelligent heating system’ Evohome, (pictured) which lets users control their heating, room by room. Evohome can even turn the heating on or off if a person forgets to do so in the morning
