The tables are set and the champagne is on ice - this is where the stars will be celebrating (or commiserating) after Sunday's Bafta Awards.

Following the ceremony at London's Royal Opera House, A listers including Keira Knightley, Eddie Redmayne and Benedict Cumberbatch will head to the afterparty at Grosvenor House.

Once there, they will sit down to dinner at elaborately decorated tables celebrating each of the films nominated for best picture.

Spectacular centrepieces have been created paying homage to The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Imitation Game, Boyhood, The Theory Of Everything and Birdman.

The award for the best centrepiece may go to The Grand Budapest Hotel creation. 

It shows a replica of the hotel atop boxes of Mendl's biscuits which play an integral part in the plot of the film starring Ralph Fiennes. 

The Birdman centrepiece looks like an imposing tower block surrounded by giant 'Birdman' wings with the mask of the superhero on top.

Buckets of Champagne are on ice ready for the stars to toast their success - or drown their sorrows

The place mats feature the faces of the nominated actors like Eddie Redmayne, pictured, up for best actor for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything

For The Theory Of Everything, which tells the story of Stephen Hawking, a replica of a Cambridge University building is filled with books celebrating how the professor studied there.

The famous gold mask awards have all been polished ready to be handed out on Sunday evening and these were included in today's photo call as the press were given a sneak peek of the afterparty. 

Meanwhile, it has been revealed the organisers at this year's awards dinner have arranged to serve a vegan menu to the stars who are meat-free eaters.

The 'plant-based' meal will feature a starter of quinoa salad with radishes, broad beans, asparagus, peas and a lemon and olive oil dressing.

Bafta's CEO said attention to detail at the party is paramount as 'if you are celebrating excellence, everything around it has to be excellent'. Pictured is a close-up of The Grand Budapest Hotel centrepiece

Next up will be a roasted butternut squash and sun-blushed tomato lasagne with wilted spinach, roasted pepper and sage as the main course.

The menu set by head chef at The Grosvenor House Hotel, Nigel Boschetti will also have bespoke gluten and dairy-free dishes for those on dietary restrictions. 

Those who can at meat will be served a trio of beef for their main course with green beans, baby carrots and Dauphinoise potatoes. 

Hotel Chocolat have been given the task of providing dessert to the hundreds of guests - to do so they will need 100kg of chocolate.

Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbach, pictured at yesterday's Pre Bafta party, have both been nominated for their roles in The Imitation Game

Earlier today, host Stephen Fry took to the stage at the Royal Opera House to practice his lines

The seating plan has been organised so nominated actors all have easy access to the stage

After dinner, the stars can then dance the night away on a 1920 square dancefloor with music provided by London-based six-piece band Molotov Jukebox, who describe their musical style as 'gypstep'.

Meanwhile at the Royal Opera House today, awards host Stephen Fry has been on stage rehearsing while the seating plan for the 2,000 guests has been organised.

The places will be set so nominated actors in the same category will not sit alongside one another and all will be placed so they can easily access the stage should their name be called as a winner. 

Bafta CEO Amanda Berry, who has organised the ceremony for the past 17 years, told Hello! magazine that attention to detail is paramount.

She said: 'If you are celebrating excellence, everything around it has to be excellent.'

She added that getting everything ready for the night is 'massive jigsaw'.  

Despite the teasers that have been revealed so far, she said they will be plenty more surprises on the night.

The EE British Academy Film Awards will be on the 8th February on BBC 1 at 9pm
