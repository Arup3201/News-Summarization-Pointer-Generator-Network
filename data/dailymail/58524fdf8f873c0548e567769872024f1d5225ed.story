A 100-year-old time capsule found in Baltimore might remain shut for fear the contents could be destroyed if it is opened.

The copper box was discovered during the renovation of the original Washington Monument in Baltimore.

Conservationists fear that as the time capsule's content has been exposed to dampness for nearly a century, it may not survive an opening. 

Blast from the past: This copper box was discovered in a niche during the renovation of the Washington Monument in Baltimore

The time capsule was discovered behind a plaque at the monument in Baltimore's Mount Vernon neighborhood.

The sealed box was put behind the plaque, placed in front of a niche to commemorate the monument's centennial, on Defender's Day, Sept. 12, 1915.

Monument officials say research has found that the time capsule contains commemorative programs and copies of The Baltimore Sun, among other items.

'We are restoring the interior plaster finishes in the Monument, most of which have been reworked many times over the years because of water damage,' said Lance Humphries, Chair of the Conservancy's restoration committee. 

The time capsule, placed behind a commemorative plaque from 1915, are said to contain commemorative programs from the centennial event and copies of the local newspaper, The Baltimore Sun

'We realized that the plaster behind this plaque might give us clues as to the appearance of the original plaster in the museum room. 

'Little did we realize that there was an actual time capsule stashed behind the plaque.' 

The box is now set to be moved to the nearby Walters Art Museum for safekeeping while restoration work on the Washington Monument continues. 

The box has not been opened, and no date has been set to open it.

Conservators from Walters will help in the eventual opening of the box because its contents may be in poor condition.

Restoration on the monument is expected to be finished in the spring.
