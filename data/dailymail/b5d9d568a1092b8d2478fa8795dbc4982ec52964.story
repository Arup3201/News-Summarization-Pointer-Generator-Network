There are plenty of women who would like much bigger boobs, plumper lips and tanned toned, some might even say 'doll-like' limbs.

But plastic obsessed Katella Dash has taken her fixation with her appearance to a whole new level.

She has spent Â£60,000, or $99,000, on cosmetic surgery in her quest to look like a blow up sex doll.

Katella was born male but now wants to look 'extremely feminine' and would love to look like a blow up doll

Katella Dash says she won't stop in her quest to look plastic despite doctors fearing fo her health. She is pictured at the age of 22, right

Blonde Katella, who has size 38H breasts, has had silicone implants and fillers to achieve a pronounced artificial look.

Katella loves to look plastic but can't find a surgeon who will boost her boobs to a huge size M

The 38-year-old was born male but underwent gender reassignment surgery at the age of 23.Since then she has had seven breast augmentations, as well as implants in her lips, cheeks and chin - but she longs for more.

Katella, from Minneapolis, USA, said: 'I love to look plastic - most people hate me for my extreme appearance but it fuels me to get more work done.

Strike a pose: Katella admits the look she is going for is 'as fake as you can get'

'I think I do have an obsession with plastic surgery, but being over the top and extreme feels normal to me.'The look I am going for is a walking blow up sex doll - it's about as fake a person as you can be.'

Each day Katella goes through a grueling three-hour beauty regime to get ready.

And she visits her local salon once a week to have her peroxide extensions cared for.

Since her last breast surgery, which took her to an enormous H cup, Katella has struggled to find a surgeon willing to take her bigger.

She said: 'Right now the only thing stopping me going to a size L or M is that no surgeons in the US are willing to operate on me.

'I have gone abroad for surgery before so I might have to do it again.'

However, her friends fear for her health and have begged her to stop her surgery obsession.

Katella's friend, Michel Voeller, said: 'Her obsession with surgery is scary, especially considering the risks involved.

'I've told her she should stop and that she doesn't need any more but she won't listen.'It's definitely getting out of control and could be dangerous.'

Growing up in the wrong body was a struggle for Katella and after saving money she travelled to Thailand for gender reassignment surgery in her twenties.

She said: 'When I was younger I felt too feminine for a boy - I was more feminine than most females.'The way I would talk, the way I would move my hands, the way I spoke.

Will Katella get her size M boobs? Doctors say there are huge risks associated with going so large

'I had the operation and I've never looked back. Now I want to achieve a hyper-feminine, extreme look.'

Over the years she has had a catalogue of procedures to modify her body including three collagen lip jobs, chin and butt implants and eye reshaping.

She said: 'The cost of all of my operations comes to about $100,000 dollars - but I have had boyfriends help pay for some procedures.'

Now single, Katella is hoping to find a surgeon willing to take her to a massive M cup.Dr Greg Mesna, of Mesna Plastic Surgery in Minneapolis, believes larger implants would not be a good idea.

Dr Mesna said: 'Extremely large implants can erode through the tissues and become exposed.'Also, with larger implants there can be neck, back and shoulder distress from the weight.'I would not recommend Katella get larger implants because of the limitations of her body.'

However, Katella remains undeterred.

She said: 'I don't worry about consequences or complications. Even if it puts my health as risk I just want to have bigger breasts.'
