Ashley Greene's Hollywood apartment blaze was caused by an unattended candle, according to fresh reports.

The Twilight star, her unnamed boyfriend and brother fled from the condo after being awoken by the fire, which killed one of her pet dogs and saw three unidentified residents suffer minor injuries.

A preliminary investigation determined the living room couch was set alight by a candle, according to law enforcement sources who spoke to TMZ.

Pictures from inside show the devastation caused after the fire tore through the entire apartment, with one eyewitness comparing the scene to a 'disaster movie'.

It is unclear if Greene’s unnamed boyfriend is Reese Witherspoon’s ex-husband Ryan Phillippe, 38. The pair became the subject of romance rumours this week after being photographed leaving Hollywood’s Vignette Lounge on Wednesday.

One of Greene's two fox terrier dogs perished in the 
blaze and was found dead under the bed, according to a resident who 
spoke to TMZ. A second dog was taken by Animal Control to be 
checked out.

The 26-year-old actress, who plays vampire Alice Cullen in the Twilight franchise, fled the apartment with her 
brother and boyfriend after being woken by the fire. The two men apparently tried to go back to save the dogs after realising they were still inside but
 were unable to re-enter.

Greene was later spotted at the scene covered in soot and pictures of the inconsolable actress cradling her dead pet, wrapped in a blanket, have since been published on TMZ.

Several residents tried to tackle the blaze with fire extinguishers before at least 
10 fire trucks screeched to the scene of the historic A-list complex, which was once lived
 in by Marilyn Monroe.

Friday's incident triggered a huge emergency response, with 55 firefighters working at the scene and 10 ambulances parked down the street.

Eyewitness Erin Boyle told MailOnline: 'It was completely burnt out, [Greene's] whole apartment was burnt to a crisp. All the 
windows were blown out with smoke billowing out of them.

'All of the building had been evacuated and all of the residence were outside. Some looked scared, some were angry.'

A second witness, Sam Nolan, said, described the drama as like a scene from a disaster movie.

'All of a sudden police rushed to close the street, blocking
 both ends. Then fire trucks started roaring down the street.

‘Three or four of the fire trucks had
 ladders going up the complex. One going into her apartment, one going onto the roof and one going around the rear.
‘All you could see was black smoke.'

Dismantling: Crews are now clearing debris and dismantling damaged parts of the structure

Mr Nola went on: 'Everyone was looking, the neighbours were taking pictures and then a TV crew turned up.

'It was like a disaster film, I thought I’d become part of a Day After Tomorrow.'

Los Angeles Fire Department Inspector Johnson confirmed crews were dispatched at 9:50 am.

'We made an aggressive fire attack. Our team saw smoke and fire coming from the third floor,' he told RadarOnline.

Inspector Johnson added: 'We have 
reports of two patrons that were burned, so they were treated by the 
paramedics and sent to the hospital.'

boyfriend is Reese Witherspoon’s ex-husband Ryan Phillippe. The pair
