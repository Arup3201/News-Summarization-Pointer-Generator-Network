Former French first lady Valerie Trierweiler today spoke for the first time about being officially dumped by Francois Hollande, insisting: ‘Don’t worry about me’.

The 48-year-old was asked during a press conference in Mumbai, India, what she intended to do without the president by her side.

Ms Trierweiler replied: ‘I don't know. I have time, there are some years ahead. I will see bit by bit. For now I am not predicting anything. In any case, don't worry about me.’

Earlier she visited sick children at the Sion children's hospital in Mumbai in a visit that echoed much of the humanitarian work that earned Princess Diana the nickname 'Queen of Hearts' following her divorce from Prince Charles in 1996.

Love rivals: Ms Trierweiler, left, has herself just spent eight days in a Paris hospital suffering from the stress of finding out Mr Hollande, 59, was having an affair with the actress Julie Gayet, 41, pictured, right, at the Dauphin jewellery launch in Paris - her first official engagement following revelations of the affair

Asked if she was particularly proud of
 anything during her relatively short time as first lady, Ms Trierweiler
 said: ‘I don't know if it's for me to judge, or for you.

‘I
 was there for 19 months. I was able to meet people I didn’t know 
before. I understood that you can be useful, and in being useful to 
others you can be useful to yourself.’

‘It
 is very touching to see these babies weighing less than a kilogramme 
and with very limited life chances,’ said Ms Trierweiler.

‘It’s an 
injustice because even if everything is done to make them better, they 
don’t have the same facilities as in our hospitals.’

Back to business: Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande met with Turkish President Abdullah Gul in Ankara, Turkey, on Monday during a two day visit

Timing: President Hollande visit coincided with a political crisis plaguing the Turkish government and turmoil in his own private life

Proud: Earlier in the day she refused to answer questions about her turbulent private life and, dressed in a navy blue jacket and skirt, looked distinctly calm and unemotional

Fired: Mr Hollande officially 'fired' Ms Trierweiler on Saturday – signalling the end of her 10 months as a first lady in a curt 18 word statement. When asked today what she would do now, she said she didn't know but told journalists: 'Don't worry about me'

Ms Trierweiler 
has herself just spent eight days in a Paris hospital suffering from the
 extreme stress of finding out that Mr Hollande, 59, was having an 
affair with the actress Julie Gayet, 41.

Now, determined to portray 
herself as a Gallic ‘Queen of Hearts’ in the tradition of the late 
Princess Diana, Ms Trierweiler posed for pictures with patients at the 
Sion children’s hospital.

Looking distinctly calm and unemotional, 
Mrs Trierweiler denied claims that her trip was an unnecessary strain on
 French tax payers’ money, saying: ‘You see, you can’t say I’m wasting 
public money, I’ve only got a bodyguard’.

In fact, Patrice Biancone,
 her ex chief of staff, is also on the trip, and she said of Ms 
Trierweiler: ‘She has not become an ordinary citizen, she is an ex first
 lady, which gives her a different status.’

Raising awareness: Ms Trierweiler is in India for a two-day trip to raise awareness about child malnutrition

The Paris Match magazine 
journalist’s charity trip to India will certainly be the last she enjoys
 with all the trappings of a VIP dignitary.

Mr Hollande has made it 
clear that he wants her to return to ordinary life, staying away from 
the Elysee Palace and living in the modest flat they once shared in 
Paris’s unfashionable 15th arrondissement.

Friends have indicated 
that she wants financial compensation from the President, who fears that
 she will turn into a loose cannon who could damage him.

Valerie Trierweiler may no longer be first lady but she still enjoyed first-class treatment when she visited Mumbai this weekend.

At the behest of the Elysee Palace, the now ex-girlfriend of the French president was furnished with a limousine and a police motorcycle cavalcade to secure her route out of Paris.

She boarded her plane without having to run the gauntlet of cameras and questions, being led onto the tarmac through a special route.

She then arrived at Mumbai's Taj Mahal Hotel at 1am on Sunday morning in a convoy of black limousines with two police jeeps for security.

And when she arrived she air-kissed staff at the charity she was visiting.

Patrice Biancone, her ex chief of staff, who is also on the trip told reporters: ‘She has not become an ordinary citizen, she is an ex first lady, which gives her a different status.’

Ms Trierweiler will certainly have her work cut out changing her image in a country where she is massively unpopular.

Le
 Monde today writes: ‘She became one of the most detested personalities 
of the French’, while a new book was set to portray her as a calculating
 mistress.

Written by the photographer Pascal Rostain, an old 
friend, it recalls how she borrowed a flat off him in 2007 to use as a 
love nest.

At the time, Mr Hollande was officially living with 
Segolone Royal, the mother of his four children who was running as the 
Socialist candidate to become president.

Mr Rostain said Ms Trierweiler and Mr Hollande left his flat ‘ransacked, turned upside down, completely messed up and dirty’.

The
 book – called ‘Voyeur, Indiscreet Memories of the King of the 
Paparazzi’ – also rubbishes claims that Ms Trierweiler was surprised and
 shocked by Mr Hollande’s affair with Ms Gayet, saying she knew about it
 long ago.

Instead, Ms Trierweiler is said to have checked into the Pitie Salpetriere hospital in a failed bid to win Mr Hollande back.

She has insisted to friends that she ‘still loves’ Mr Hollande and is hugely upset at losing her status as first lady.

Mr
 Hollande, who had never married, is now expected to remain a ‘bachelor 
president’ for a while, while continuing with his relationship with Ms 
Gayet outside the Elysee.

Ms Gayet has not spoken since the pictures 
were published of Mr Hollande leaving their Paris love nest on the back 
of a moped, while using a crash helmet as a poor disguise.

Meanwhile, 19 police officers were injured and some 250 people arrested after a protest against President Francois Hollande's leadership degenerated into violence, police in Paris said today.

The numbers of casualties and detentions is high compared with other protests in recent weeks expressing discontent with Mr Hollande, who is particularly unpopular for his handling of the economy.

Police say some 17,000 people took part in yesterday's largely peaceful protest, while organisers put the number several times higher.

Some 50 associations were involved, including conservative and far-right groups. Also present were supporters of provocateur-comic Dieudonne, who has been repeatedly convicted of anti-Semitism and racism.
