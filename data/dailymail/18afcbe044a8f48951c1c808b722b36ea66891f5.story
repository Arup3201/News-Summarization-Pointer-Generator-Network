He expressed his devastation on Twitter, with the simple statement 'No words' on Monday.

And on Wednesday Billy Crystal looked downcast as he arrived at the Los Angeles International airport, two days after the passing of his dear friend and colleague Robin Williams.

Crystal and Williams, along with Whoopi Goldberg, raised an estimated $80million for people in need with their Comic Relief standup comedy specials, which spanned over 20 years.

After he tweeted on Monday about being speechless in the face of losing Williams, Whoopi wrote on the microblogging site: 'Billy Crystal is right...There are no words.'

Billy and Robin also starred in 1997 film Father's Day, in addition to enjoying both a public and private friendship.

Adding to the long list of tributes for the late great comedian, Lisa Jakub, who played Williams' teenage daughter in Mrs Doubtfire, wrote a touching homage to the star on her blog.

The actress relates how when she was only 14-years-old she went on location to film Mrs Doubtfire for five months. But the actress' school was not pleased, kicking her out for missing classes.

'When I arrived at work the next day, Robin noticed that I was upset and asked me what was wrong. I explained what had happened, and the next day, he handed me a letter that he wrote to my school.

'He explained that I was just trying to continue my education while pursuing my career. He wrote embarrassingly kind things about my character and my work, and requested that they reconsider and allow me to return to my classes.'

Williams' assistant Rebecca Erwin Spencer discovered his body on Monday, in Tiburon, California.

And now her husband Dan Spencer has posted a tribute on Facebook, writing: 'Oh, if you could only have seen the war raging inside him. It would have stopped your heart. We fought the fight with him, but it left him defeated.'

Adding: 'Now our hero has laid down his arms. He has bid his soldiers farewell. The final fight is over.'

Meanwhile, the casts of Aladdin - both the 1992 
film and the current Broadway hit - are honouring Williams, who 
played the manic, fast-talking, unforgettable Genie in the Disney classic.

Scot 
Weinger, who played Aladdin in the animated film, said Wednesday that 
working with his hero was surreal and magical, adding the world has 'lost a bright light.'

Weinger described himself as a lifelong 
Willams fan who had a Mork doll as a kid and a poster of Dead Poets 
Society on his wall as an emerging actor. Working with his hero was 
surreal and magical, he said.

Linda Larkin, who voiced Princess 
Jasmine in the movie, called Williams a 'wild, soulful, boundless 
spirit,' characterizing his Genie character from the movie as 'the best 
gift ever.'

Their reaction came a day after the cast of 
Broadway's hit show Aladdin created their own tribute. James Monroe 
Iglehart, who won a Tony Award as the Genie, led the crowd at the New 
Amsterdam Theatre on Tuesday in a rousing version of Friend Like Me 
after the curtain went down. The show's Playbills had been stuffed with 
the song's lyrics and everyone was encouraged to sing along.

Williams will also be honoured during a special segment at the upcoming Emmy Awards.

Organisers of the 66th annual event, set to take place in Los Angeles on August 25, plan to include plenty of tributes to the 63-year-old actor, whose body was discovered by his personal assistant at his home in Tiburon, California on Monday after he committed suicide.

Executive producer of the star-studded ceremony Don Mischer told PEOPLE.com: 'Plans for the In Memoriam segment are in discussion. While we are all still coming to terms with this week's tragic news, we are working to give Robin Williams the proper and meaningful remembrance he so well deserves.'

The In Memoriam section of the ceremony usually pays tribute to Hollywood stars and respected members of the film industry who died over the previous year.

The star's family members and close friends have started planning the Oscar-winning actor's private funeral and a public memorial is also in the works.

A source recently said: 'Everyone is obviously just stunned that Robin committed suicide . . . his family is holed up together and beginning to make plans for a very private funeral.There will most likely be a public memorial to celebrate his life that his fans can be a part of.'
