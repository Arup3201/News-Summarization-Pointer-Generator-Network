Glasgow-based restauranteur
Domenico Crolla first started making Pizza Art by creating an image of Bruce Lee on one
 of his pies. After a touching 'thank you' message from the late film 
star's daughter Shannon, the artisan chef was inspired to carry on his 
celebrity dishes.

He has since put together incredibly detailed portraits of Anna Wintour, Tom Ford, Rihanna and Marylin Monroe - to name a few.

'Tom Ford was actually one of my easiest so far with his perfect skin and lack of wrinkles. Not even bags under his eyes,' says Crolla of his Couture Pizzas.

Crolla uses mainly just cheese and tomato 
sauce to make the realistic images and posts images of his work on his 
Facebook and Twitter accounts. Crolla has gained a cult following - with
 many of the impressed famous faces he recreates getting in touch to 
thank him.

'Rihanna, Beyonce, Cristiano Ronaldo have all answered back thanking me for my pizzas. Sophia Loren also got back to me...

'I even made Dita Von Teese go, "Wow!" Not a lot of men can make that claim.

'I’m now hoping that Tom Ford will get in contact. I’d love to ask him for a Tom Ford Couture Chef’s Jacket in return. That would be very cool indeed,' said Crolla, speaking to Fashionista.com.

Crolla considers his work couture as he wants to 'show that our pizzas are made fresh for each customer by skilled artisans with a large choice of gourmet toppings. It’s not fast food,' he says.

'Haute couture, by definition, refers to the creation of exclusive custom-fitted clothing. It is made to order for a specific customer, and it is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable seamstresses, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques.

'I felt the above description reflected what I wanted to do with food.'
