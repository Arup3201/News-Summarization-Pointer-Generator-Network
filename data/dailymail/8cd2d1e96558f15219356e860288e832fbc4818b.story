New signing: Jose Mourinho is joining BT Sport

Jose Mourinho is joining a new team - but don't worry Chelsea fans, he won't be leaving the Bridge.

The Chelsea manager has signed a three-year deal with BT Sport and will carry out various roles for the channel, including making football programmes, acting as an expert on the game and becoming an ambassador for the network.

Mourinho's first appearance on the channel will be in a new TV advert which airs on Saturday, before the Brazil-Holland World Cup third-placed play-off.

He said: 'I’m looking forward to working with BT Sport.  In their first year they have shown they are not afraid to challenge, are open to new ideas and want to do things differently. This is the kind of team and ambition that I want to work with.'

Grant Best, a senior channel executive producer at BT Sport, said: 'Jose Mourinho is one of the greatest managers of all time. He is a double UEFA Champions League winner, has won seven domestic league titles including the Barclays Premier League, which he has won twice, as well as numerous domestic cup competitions including the FA Cup. 

One of the greatest: BT Sport are delighted to have Mourinho on board

To add this winning mentality and 
wealth of experience to BT Sport’s football coverage, and with the UEFA 
Champions League coming to BT Sport next season, is simply fantastic.

'Jose
 is well known for his sense of humour, strong views and unique 
character and we will showcase this along with his expert insight into 
our coverage of the Barclays Premier League, European leagues and 
competitions.'

BT Sport has the rights to live top tier matches from the Barclays Premier League, the FA Cup, Scottish Professional Football League, UEFA Europa League and the German Bundesliga, Serie A in Italy, Ligue 1 in France, Brasileiro in Brazil and Major League Soccer in the USA.
