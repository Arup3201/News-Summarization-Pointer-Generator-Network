A 12-year-old girl who was seriously injured in a car crash that killed her mother as they drove to Thanksgiving celebrations has finally returned home after five months in hospital.

Lauren Nevil revealed her amazing recovery as she threw out the first pitch at her little brother's baseball game in Arlington, Texas on Sunday, three days after she left hospital.

Her progress is all the more amazing after doctors told her father that she might never walk again.

'She slept in her own bed for the first night in 161 days,' her proud father told The Tennessean after helping support Lauren, who was fitted with an orthopedic boot after losing four toes in the accident.

Heading home: Lauren Nevil, 12, left hospital last week, five months after she was injured in a car crash

On her first night home, she enjoyed a
sleepover with her cousins before spending the weekend with family - 
and even successfully climbing the stairs in her home.

'I was very impressed with the strength she showed,' her father wrote on Facebook.

Steve Nevil, his wife Katy and their 
two children, Lauren and Will, nine, were driving from their new home in Franklin, 
Tennessee to Arlington, Texas for Thanksgiving last year 
when they hit by a car.

Standing strong: Lauren is walking on her own - although doctors doubted she would again

The
impact sent their vehicle crashing into trees along the highway near 
the Texas state line, immediately killing 38-year-old Katy and gravely 
injuring Lauren.

She was airlifted to hospital, where doctors learned she had suffered a traumatic brain injury, a 
broken femur, three broken ribs, a collapsed lung and damage to her foot 
that cost her four toes.

But amid losing their beloved mother 
and wife, the Nevil family has pulled through to show amazing 
determination, buoyed by communities in Texas and Tennessee.

Throughout his daughter's inspiring recovery, Steve Nevil father has been documenting her progress on a Facebook group, Pray for the Nevils, which now has more than 300,000 followers.

He has reported on her numerous surgeries and physical therapy sessions at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, uploading videos and photos of her struggles and her milestones.

She
will now have outpatient therapy for more than six hours a day, four 
days a week, and will probably need it for several months, The 
Tennessean reported.

Doctors
are still working to find out how much brain damage she suffered; her 
spatial organization was damaged in the crash, leaving her unable to 
carry out functions such as tying her shoelaces.

For now, she will be taught by her 
father and tutors until she is tested in summer to see whether she can 
return to school or if she will need to attend a special program.

Over her recovery, Steve Nevil, 41, 
has shared videos of her sitting up unassisted for the first time, 
enjoying a few sips of a cherry-flavoured slushie and opening a 
Valentine's gift surrounded by her family and friends.

There
have also been updates of her medical condition, from operations to her
diet, to how she has slowly but surely regained normal sleeping 
patterns and her speech.

In one upbeat post, he describes her drinking from the slushie and how everyone in the room at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth anxiously waited for her to react.

'It was kind of an 
awkward 10-15 seconds,' he wrote on a video. 'The room was dead silent as we were hoping the 
drink would go down fine without incident.

'Then in a very soft, subtle 
& sweet voice we hear - "man, that is really good." We all cracked 
up laughing and exhaled a sigh of relief! I say YouHooo.'

Most recently, he has uploaded signs of her counting down the days until she can leave hospital.

Best care: She was transported to Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth in December

He has also written entries from 
his daughter's point of view, painting an emotional picture of her 
struggles and excitement at her progress.

'As
of last night, daddy was able to use a "real" toothbrush and "training"
toothpaste (that is okay to swallow),' he wrote on January 26 in his 
daughter's voice. 'It was so amazing how the smallest things makes the 
biggest difference & makes me feel so much better at that particular
time.'

In response to the entries, friends, relatives and strangers have posted their own comments of well-wishes and encouragement to the family.

Earlier
this year, they held a fundraiser inspired by Lauren's nickname - Lolo 
Palooza - and 550 people helped raise $24,000 at the Grease Monkey in 
Arlington.

Love: In total, she spent 161 days in hospital, where her younger brother and father visited daily

Upbeat: After losing her toes, she has been fitted with an orthopedic foot but also uses a wheelchair

Smiling: The Nevils had only just moved to the area but said the community has rallied around them

'I hope to keep this going for years 
to come because Lauren will need help for a long period of time to heal 
with her injuries,' said organizer and family friend MK Davis.

Friends have also helped organize fundraising walks in Dallas-Fort Worth and Franklin, where the family has become well known and well-liked.

'You instantly felt like you'd known them
your entire life,' Mark Moorman, a friend of the family, told 
ABC. 'They were very welcoming, warm, 
loving people.'

Katy Nevil's brother, Jimmy Brimson, said the family is encouraged and supported by the community.

'It's mind-blowing to see all of the 
cards and notes from people not just in the U.S. but from all over the 
world,' he said. 'It's easy to be cynical in today's world, but this 
outpouring of love, prayers and support makes you realise that there are
still a whole lot of good people in this world.'

Looking forward: Steve said he is now focused on his daughter's recovery and making sure his son does not grow up too quickly following their family's tragedy

Mr Nevil said he believes people have been so generous thanks to his wife's contagious positivity. 

'Katy always, always, always, without 
question, always helped whoever she could,' he said. 'I truly think that passion she had in her heart 
is being reciprocated.'

He added to the Star Telegram that he finds it ironic that he is doing so much writing on the Facebook group as his wife, a certified teacher, always handled business or correspondence.

He said that he is unsure about his daughter's long-term prognosis, but he's staying positive - as his wife would wish.

'When I'm alone, it's easy to ask, "Why me?"' he said. 'But I know that's not how Katy would see it.'
