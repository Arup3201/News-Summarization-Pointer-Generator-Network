The Facebook 'like' has now become the easiest way to show our approval of what our friend ate for lunch or the fluffiness of their pet cat.

Now, a new 'want' button will allow users to announce their desire for a new wardrobe or expensive lingerie at the click of a button.

The social networking firm is testing a feature that lets people create 'wishlists' of home furnishings, clothing and other items, as part of what could become a move into e-commerce.

Buy it now! Users will be shown images of products and encouraged to flag them with a 'want' or 'collect' button (file picture)

It is currently working with seven retailers, including Pottery Barn and Victoria's Secret, and will encourage users to buy products through the site or send them directly to the online stores.

The 'Collections' feature is also being trialled with Neiman Marcus, Michael Kors, Smith Optics, Wayfair and Fab.com.

Soon, all US users will begin seeing messages and images from retailers suggesting they flag products using either a 'want' or a 'collect' button.

Products you have clicked on will then appear in your Timeline - which is not how the current 'like' button works.

Facebook said in a statement: 'People will be able to engage with 
these collections and share things they are interested in with their 
friends. People can click through and buy these items off of Facebook.'

A spokeswoman said the company will not receive a fee when someone purchases a Facebook wishlist item from a retailer's site.

Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian 
said the new Collections feature could open up new sources of revenue 
for Facebook, whose stock has taken a drubbing as concerns about its 
long-term money-making prospects have mounted.

'E-commerce is one of the best ways to monetise the Internet,' he said.

'Thinking about how large they are as a 
platform and how engaged people are, there are lots of levers they 
haven't pulled yet in terms of monetisation.'

Retailers might also pay Facebook to 
promote products featured on users' wishlists, Mr Sebastian suggested, in a similar technique used in the current ads function.

Shares of Facebook, finished on 
Monday down 2.4 per cent at $20.40, and earlier the same day, BTIG 
analyst Richard Greenfield downgraded Facebook to a 'Sell' rating.

In a note to investors, he cited 
concerns about the company's advertising business, particularly 
Facebook's efforts to expand the business on to mobile devices.
