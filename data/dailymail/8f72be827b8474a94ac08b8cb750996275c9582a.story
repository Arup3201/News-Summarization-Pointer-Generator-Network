Two infamously flashy sons of arrested Sinaloa drug king pin El Chapo could see their flamboyant lifestyle slip away soon. 

Jorge Martín Torres was arrested last week and officials at his Thursday bond hearing said Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman's sons Alfredo and Ivan Guzmán--known for their social media accounts filled with photos of guns, cars, jets and women--got their flashy goods with the 37-year-old's help. 

Specifically, a DEA agent in San Antonia testified that Torres helped El Chapo's sons gain access to exotic cars and a twin-engine jet they used to transport cocaine and to avoid capture, reports Chron.com. 

And after their brother Ismael Zambada Imperial, AKA 'El Mayito Gordo,' became the third El Chapo son arrested in recent years last week, some are suggesting the net is closing in on not just their source of luxury goods but also the brothers themselves.

End of an era? Ivan Guzman, son of Sinaloa king pin El Chapo, has a history of showing off his luxury lifestyle on Twitter, but a man accused of enabling his big dollar purchases has been arrested

If kingpin's sons truly do lose access to the world's finer things with Torres' arrest, theirs will be a precipitous fall from the apex of indulgence.

Ivan Guzman's Twitter account looks like something out of a hip hop music video and reveals an impossibly lavish lifestyle allegedly built on the gruesome drug cartel wars raging south of the U.S. border and fueled by America's hunger for cocaine.

A pile of keys sporting the emblems of  sportscar makers are piled on a counter in one shot--a not-so-subtle nod toward the other photos that show Ivan and Alfredo's seemingly countless Maseratis, Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Mercedes and the like.

One photo shows Ivan giving a quick thumbs up before boarding a prop plane. Along with Alfredo's Instagram, the two men have a vivid history of showing off on social media--but how long will it continue? 

Just last week, another son of the alleged Sinaloa drug cartel boss Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada was captured in northwestern Mexico, a federal official said Thursday.

The Sinaloa cartel is considered to be Mexico's largest drug trafficking organization, with a global reach as far away as Australia

Ismael Zambada Imperial, alias 'El Mayito Gordo,' was arrested in Sinaloa state and transported to Mexico City, the official told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity because authorities expected to make an official announcement later in the day.

The official said Zambada Imperial assumed a more prominent role in the cartel this year after his father became the top leader following the capture of capo Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman in February.

He is the third of Zambada's sons to be detained in recent years.

Jesus Vicente Zambada Niebla was arrested in 2009 and extradited the following year to the United States, where in 2013 he pleaded guilty to a drug trafficking charge.

Serafin Zambada was arrested at the end of 2013 at an Arizona border crossing. He also pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges in September and faces a sentence of at least 10 years in prison.

The Sinaloa cartel is considered to be Mexico's largest drug trafficking organization, with a global reach as far away as Australia.

The U.S. and Mexican governments have offered multimillion-dollar rewards for information leading to the capture of 'El Mayo' Zambada. 

The U.S. and Mexican governments have offered multimillion-dollar rewards for information leading to the capture of 'El Mayo' Zambada, are Ivan and Alfredo next?

The good life? Many photos are a reminder that--while their fortune is alleged to be based on bloodshed and drugs--the Guzmans continue to have moments of tranquil indulgence
