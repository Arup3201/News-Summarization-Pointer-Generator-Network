A  man who claimed to have a bomb while boarding a flight from Slovakia to London Luton airport was allowed to get on the plane by staff who dismissed him as merely being drunk.

The 30-year-old was boarding a Whizz Air flight on December 7 when he told security officials that he had 'a bomb and grenades' in his luggage.

Incredibly, security allowed him to board the plane and it  was only when he repeated his claims to the cabin crew that he was removed from the flight because staff refused to fly with him.

The man told security staff at Propad airport in Slovakia that he had 'a bomb and grenades' in his luggage, but was allowed to board the Whizz Air flight to London Luton airport and dismissed as being drunk

The man, who has not been named, was detained at Poprad Airport in northern Slovakia, which has previously attracted controversy for security breaches.

In January 2010 officials at the airport caused a major security scare after putting a fake explosive device into a man's luggage during routine training for sniffer dogs.

The dogs found the device, but after the training had finished authorities forgot to take it out again, and allowed him to board a plane to Dublin, where he was arrested as a suspected terrorist. 

The man was only released after Slovakian police admitted what they had done to Irish authorities.

Police spokesman Daniel Dzobanik said : 'During the process of getting onto the plane flying from Poprad to London, the passenger told the stewardess that he carried a bomb. 

'These claims were later found to be untrue.'

Propad airport has previously been in trouble for security breaches after officials accidentally left a fake explosive device in a man's bag after using it for training, before allowing him on to a flight

The plane was allowed to continue on its way after the man's luggage was removed and he had been arrested.

Officers tested the man and found that he was four times over the legal drink drive limit. 

Poprad Airport spokesperson Ivana Herkelova denied they had done anything wrong in allowing the man to board the plane obviously drunk and after having claimed to have been carrying explosives.

The man now faces charges of interfering with public transport by making false threats.
