Jade Goody, who died in 2009 from cervical cancer, told of her fears that her phone was hacked

Jade Goody's mother has said her daughter feared her phone was being hacked.

Jackiey Budden also believes she was targeted weeks before Jade died.

Publicist Max Clifford told the Guardian: 'She will be going to the police. She believes her phone was hacked by the News of the World, and Jade’s.

'Jade told me, ‘I’m convinced my phone is being hacked’.”

Scotland Yard and News International declined to comment on the allegations.

Mr Clifford told Sky News: 'According to Jackiey, there were several stories which 
could only have been obtained through hacking.'

'If your daughter is dying, to know that confidential messages are being 
listened to - you can imagine how any mother would feel,' he added.

The reality TV star died aged 27 on Mother's Day 2009 after a very 
public battle with cervical cancer.

Jade
was diagnosed in August 2008 and was told the news while 
she was on Big Boss, India's version of Big Brother.

In February 2009, she was told the cancer had spread to her liver, bowel and 
groin and was now terminal.

In further revelations, it appears a former News of the World executive received thousands of pounds of secret payments from News International while working at Scotland Yard.

Neil Wallis picked up £25,000 during late 2009 and in 2010 for providing ‘crime exclusives’, detailing Metropolitan Police investigations.

Secret payments: Neil Wallis received money from News International while working for the Metropolitan Police

He was working as a consultant for Sir Paul Stephenson, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, and being paid £24,000 a year by the taxpayer.

The details of the payments from 
Rupert Murdoch’s media company have been found by detectives probing 
phone hacking at the News of the World.

The Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Wallis may have been selling stories to other newspapers while working at Scotland Yard.

He was deputy to News of the World editor Andy Coulson at the time phone hacking was taking place.

Known as the ‘Wolfman’, he was made executive editor after Mr Coulson resigned as editor. He then left News International in August 2009.

A month later he joined the Met on a two-day-a-month contract advising top officers.

Mr Wallis resigned from Scotland Yard last September following allegations of phone hacking at his former paper, and this July he was arrested on suspicion of intercepting phone messages.

Details of his employment led to the resignation from the Met of Sir Paul and another senior officer, John Yates.

Andy Coulson is suing News Group Newspapers, his former employer

It was reported last night that during his employment at Scotland Yard, he received payments totalling £25,000 from News International. This included a payment of £10,000 for a single crime story.

Police believe one of the stories he fed to the media company included details of a suspected assassination attempt on the Pope during last year’s visit.

It also emerged last night that Mr Coulson may have started the process of suing his bosses at the defunct newspaper.

Legal documents lodged in London yesterday show that News Group Ltd, which owned the News of the World, is being sued by a Mr A Coulson.

Mr Coulson became David Cameron’s director of communications after his stint as editor of the disgraced paper.

He resigned from Downing Street in January and was arrested by detectives and questioned over phone hacking in July.

Rupert Murdoch has apologised for the 'serious wrongdoing' of the News of the World phone hacking scandal which brought down the Sunday tabloid

Neither News International nor Mr Coulson would comment over whether the ‘Mr A Coulson’ is indeed the former editor.

If it is, it is likely the lawsuit is linked to News International’s decision to stop paying his legal bills.

Glenn
Mulcaire, the private investigator jailed in 2007 over phone hacking, 
sued the company last month after the company stopped paying his legal 
fees.

The case, A Coulson v News Group Newspapers Ltd, will be heard at the High Court of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division.

Last
month, it emerged that Mr Coulson continued to receive payments agreed 
as part of a severance package even after he was taken on by the 
Conservatives.
