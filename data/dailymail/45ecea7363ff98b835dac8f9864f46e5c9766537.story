Stylishly single: Joos chose not to wear a summer dress because it was 'freezing'

A casting agent for Vogue has opened up about how her date, a 49-year-old Goldman Sachs lawyer, told her that she wasn't showing enough skin. 

He said 'you should have worn a skirt,' she writes on her blog Tales of Endearment. 'This wasn't meant as a joke. He continued to complain about my lack of skin until we left the restaurant.'

According to her date, wearing a short skirt was 'the only way to tell the guy is a "James 
Bond"' because 'if he can keep his cool while you're sitting there 
flaunting your goods, he's a real man.'

Joos' story should be viewed as a cautionary tale about how differently men and women view first date attire. Like Joos, many women go into dates with a feeling of being 'helpless and desperate to please.' 

This is why we change outfits six times to 
unearth the ideal combination classy and sexy. But for most men, the only accessories that matter are cleavage and a smile. 

Working in fashion presents Joos with an additional set of challenges: 'I'm not used to dressing for straight 
men,' she explains.

'Everyone's either gay or a woman. And the rare 
straight man who does loiter around in the colorful corridors of the 
fashion industry chases models for sport. So I dress for myself and 
other girls.'

We have our go-to body armor - mine is a  Helmut Lang dress that is long enough for work but shows 
cleavage with my jacket off.

But as a freelance writer, my outfits often 
depend on my assignments. After writing an article on the super-short skirt trend, I showed up 
to my date straight from the photo shoot in a neon yellow Christopher Kane micro mini with five-inch 
heels - only to have my date joke that I looked 'like Big Bird'.

Another
guy told me me point-blank that he 'hated' the large bow on my blouse, 
and a third called my Christian Louboutin purple ankle boots 'an abortion'.

Stepping out: Casting agent and fashion blogger Natalie Joos says that she feels 'helpless and desperate to please' when deciding what to wear on a first date

Joos was wearing 'a tiny
Peter 
Pilotto shirt that bared my arms and shoulders quite generously' adding,
'really isn’t that the only thing you can see when you’re across from 
someone at a table?'

Unfairly judged: Catherine Townsend (pictured with her husband) wore a neon yellow mini skirt on a date - and the guy joked she looked 'like Big Bird'

She adds that she was 'freezing', so wearing a skirt wasn't very practical. Fashion magazines don't usually
cover 'stilettos that won't get stuck in subway escalators' or '
slits that won't fly up to expose your underwear to construction workers.'

Still she wondered if she made the 
right call. 'Was I wrong to wear pants? Was I wrong to assume I would 
come off as slutty or too eager if I wore a short skirt?' she asks.

Her date, who argued that '99per cent of men would say they prefer a skirt over pants' would say yes.

To investigate, Joos 'stopped a few 
guys around the West Village and asked them if it was suitable for a 
first date, or if they would have preferred to see a skirt instead.'

Among this (perhaps slightly biased) demographic, she says 'the answers were all in my favor.'

Sometimes, however, men are being 
self-conscious rather than sexist. A lot of guys, especaily those who 
work in competitive industries, are used to teasing their friends and 
may be cracking a joke to break the ice.

My husband asked me 'Have you ever considered getting breast implants?' on one of our very first dates.

The right to bare arms: For her date Joos chose a tiny Peter Pilotto shirt

Instead of taking it personally, I smiled and said 'have you ever considered getting a penis implant?'

He never brought it up again.
