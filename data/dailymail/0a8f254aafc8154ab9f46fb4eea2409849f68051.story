Syria's deputy oil minister has announced he is defecting from the regime and joining the opposition against President Bashar Assad.

In a video posted on YouTube, a man wearing a suit and tie identifies himself as Abdo Husameddine.

He says he is defecting because of Assad's brutal crackdown that has killed thousands of people in the past year.

Resignation: Syria's deputy oil minister Abdo Husameddine has announced via YouTube that he is defecting from the regime and joining the opposition against President Bashar Assad

If confirmed, this would be the highest ranking official in Assad's administration to defect since the uprising began a year ago.

There have been scores of army defections but civilian government officials have remained largely loyal to Assad's regime.

It was not clear when or where the video was filmed and there has been no comment from the Syrian government.

Meanwhile, the U.N. humanitarian chief has toured the shattered Syrian district of Baba Amr but found most residents had fled following the bloody military siege.

Activists have accused the government of trying to cover up evidence of atrocities there.

The month-long crackdown on the rebellious Homs neighborhood brought international condemnation, and the top U.S. military leader said yesterday that President Barack Obama has asked the Pentagon for a preliminary review of military options in Syria.

These include enforcement of a no-fly zone and humanitarian airlifts, Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate.

However, both he and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Mr Obama still believes that economic sanctions and international diplomatic isolation were the best ways to pressure Syrian President Bashar Assad into handing over power.

Yesterday's visit to Baba Amr by the U.N. humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos, was the first by an independent outside observer since the Syrian military began its assault of the rebellious neighborhood.

A key stronghold of the uprising against Assad, it was wrested from rebel control on March 1.

The Syrian regime has kept the neighborhood sealed off over the past six days, saying it was too dangerous for humanitarian workers to enter.

But activists accused the government of engaging in a 'mopping-up' operation to hide their atrocities.

'They haven't let anyone in for a week, and now they are going to let them in?' Homs activists Tarek Badrakhan told The Associated Press.

'Today it's simple: They finished their crimes and hid all the proof. Now they think they can show that everything is normal.'

A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said Baroness Amos entered Baba Amr with a team from the Syrian Red Crescent that had been waiting nearly a week to be allowed in and found the ravaged neighborhood deserted.

'The Syrian Arab Red Crescent stayed about 45 minutes inside the neighborhood,' Red Cross spokesman Hicham Hassan said in Geneva.

'Volunteers say that most inhabitants have fled Baba Amr.'

American Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also lashed out at the delays in letting aid workers in.

'The regime's refusal to allow humanitarian workers to help feed the hungry, tend to the injured, bury the dead, marks a new low,' she said.

'Tons of food and medicine are standing by while more civilians die and the regime launches new assaults.'

Baroness Amos said the aim of her 
two-day visit to Syria was 'to urge all sides to allow unhindered access
for humanitarian relief workers so they can evacuate the wounded and 
deliver essential supplies.'

She
met with Syria's foreign minister and is to meet other government 
officials today but it was unclear whether she would be allowed to 
return to Baba Amr or deliver any aid.

The U.N. says more than 7,500 people have been killed since Syria's uprising began. Activists put the death toll at more than 8,000.

Republican Senator John McCain has called on the Obama administration to launch U.S. airstrikes to end Assad's crackdown.

But Mr Panetta and Gen. Dempsey described a well-armed Syria that bears little resemblance to what the U.S. military and its allies faced in Libya.

Syria's air defenses are five times more sophisticated than Libya's, and its chemical and biological weapons stockpile is 100 times larger, they said.

Suppressing the air defences would require a sustained air campaign over an extended period of time with a significant number of aircraft, and the U.S. would have to lead the effort, Gen. Dempsey said.

Because the air defences are located in populous neighborhoods, airstrikes could also mean scores of unintended deaths.

After seizing Baba Amr from the rebels, regime forces now appear to be turning their attention to other rebellious areas.

A wave of new arrests was reported in Homs by the Local Coordinating Committees, an activist group, as well as assaults on the northern province of Idlib near Turkey.

The shift suggests the Syrian military is unable to launch large operations simultaneously, even though the security services remain largely strong and loyal.

According to witnesses, Syrian troops shelled the northern villages in Idlib yesterday. There also were reports of snipers in Homs province.

Russia and China, powerful Syrian allies that have blocked a Security Council resolution against Syria, have made clear they are still standing by the regime in Damascus.

Still, in a sign of China's growing alarm, Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said Beijing was pulling its workers out of Syria because of the violence.

In Moscow, Russian leader Vladimir Putin said the government wasn't considering granting political asylum to Assad, shooting down rumors that such an offer is on the table as a way to end the Syrian regime's deadly crackdown.
