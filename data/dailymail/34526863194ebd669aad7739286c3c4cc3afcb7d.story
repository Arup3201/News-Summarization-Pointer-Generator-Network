As Charles Dickens sat eating his picnic lunch among the gravestones of St James churchyard in the Kent village of Cooling, inspiration came to him for the opening scenes  of Great Expectations, in which the convict Magwitch meets orphan Pip.

Many of the graves in the churchyard – six miles from Dickens’s former home in Rochester – mark the resting places of members of the family of Eliza Clay, a landowner’s widow who built nearby Cooling Court in 1700 and whose family owned it until 1930.

Today, the beautiful three-storey, four-bedroom farmhouse sitting in grounds of one-and-a-half acres is owned by Stuart and Stephanie Hatton, who fell in love with it the moment they saw it.

Dickensian manor:  In the three years since Stuart and Stephanie Hatton bought Cooling Court in Cooling, Kent, its value has jumped by more than a third, to £825,000

‘It was the only house we looked at when we decided to move from Buckinghamshire to Kent,’ says Stephanie, 31. ‘We were driving away from the viewing and I told Stuart to turn the car round, go back and tell the owner to sell it to no one else.’ They agreed to pay the £600,000 asking price and moved in within weeks.

It proved a shrewd buy, and in the three years since they bought it, its value has jumped by more than a third, to £825,000, even though they have spent just £50,000 repointing the brickwork and improving the turning circle. They could have added more value  by turning the former servants’ quarters on the top floor into more bedrooms.

The reason for the increase in value is the growing popularity of this corner of North Kent and the improvement in road and rail links to London and Paris, which is just two hours away. Trains from Ebbsfleet station take just 19 minutes to travel to St Pancras; the Bluewater shopping centre is 20 minutes away and trains from Rochester or Strood take less than an hour to reach London.

‘We can be at our office in East London in  45 minutes,’ says Stephanie, who, with Stuart, runs an agency providing off-screen ‘talent’, such as camera crews, directors and runners, to the film and television industry.

Indoor space: The three-floor home has four bedrooms, but the old servants quarter could be refurbished into four more

She adds: ‘We’re only moving because we need to be nearer to my mother in Cambridgeshire, but a house like this there would cost well over £1 million.’

The house is quintessentially English. Its reflection is clear in the pond in the garden. The rooms are generously proportioned and plentiful, and the decor is tasteful. One of Cooling Court’s other attractions for the Hattons and their sons, Max, five, and three-year-old Zach, was its top floor – 1,400 square feet of space that used to contain servants’ bedrooms.

‘It hasn’t been lived  in for 100 years,’ says Stuart. ‘At the moment it’s stripped back to the plaster and has original oak floorboards and timbers. There’s room for four large bedrooms because it has the same footprint as the floor below.’

The next owners of the property might not need four new bedrooms as the existing accommodation offers plenty of space. The four first-floor bedrooms are all doubles, and on the ground floor is a large reception hall, two sitting rooms and a wide staircase. There is also a breakfast/dining room with an Aga – this room could be turned into a large kitchen to replace the smaller existing one.

Inspiration: The village of Cooling inspired Charles Dickens for the opening scenes of Great Expectations.

There is also an attached workshop, utility room and study. And it is no surprise to discover that the property has featured  on the TV househunting show Escape To  The Country. Outside, the gardens include  an orchard and enjoy views across the  Kent countryside.

A marble plaque on an exterior wall of Cooling Court records Eliza Clay as its builder, and the village of Cooling itself is steeped in history. Its castle was built in the 14th Century and, although most of it is now in ruins, a house within is owned by Jools Holland, the television presenter and musician.

In the opening chapter of Great Expectations, Dickens describes the churchyard where Pip’s parents are buried as a ‘bleak place, overgrown with nettles’. St James churchyard, however, epitomises the charm and tranquillity of the English countryside.

‘This part of Kent is becoming more and more desirable because you get a lot for your money,’ says Stuart, 34. ‘It’s a beautiful little village with a great traditional pub. We won’t get anything like this where we’re looking.’

Ironically, for some buyers, Cooling Court’s rural location may be a deterrent. ‘It is in a very quiet spot,’ says Martin Lawson, of the estate agency Fine and Country in West Malling, which is selling the house. ‘A lot of people either want to live in town or just outside. Cooling Court is a lot more remote.’

However, he adds: ‘We’ve had a lot of interest, even though it’s only just come on  the market.’
