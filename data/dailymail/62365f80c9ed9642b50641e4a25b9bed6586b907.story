Stripping down to a nude leotard and tutu, this is the moment a ballsy college student reenacts Sia's Chandelier music video around campus.

Henry Long, who is enrolled at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, prances, dances and twirls around for the duration of the track, much to the bemusement of his peers.

At one point he performs high leg kicks in the common room with his underpants on display and in another scene he writhes around on the floor of the cafeteria with his derriere in the air.
