Ten public schools have produced one in eight of the professional elite who effectively run the country, a report revealed yesterday.

Eton College alone boasts four per cent of the nation’s most prominent citizens  as old boys, including Prime Minister David Cameron, London Mayor Boris Johnson and Justin Welby, the next  Archbishop of Canterbury.

Almost a third of those holding senior positions in business, politics, law and the diplomatic service also have an Oxbridge education, the study found.

Acting royalty: Actor Daniel Craig is one of just 10 per cent of successful figures who went to a comprehensive while his actress wife Rachel Weisz attended a series of highly regarded private schools

The report by the Sutton Trust examined the educational backgrounds of 8,000 people who appeared in the birthday lists of national newspapers last year. It found that the 50 schools with the highest numbers of notable former pupils were all fee-paying.

 Overall, 44 per cent of those on the birthday lists were privately-educated, 27 per cent from state grammar schools, and 10 per cent from comprehensives. This is despite only 6.5 per cent of the nation’s children being educated at private schools.

Sixty-eight per cent of leading figures in ‘public service’ – which included royalty, lord-lieutenants, and others in national, public or local government organisations – were privately educated, followed by law (63 per cent), senior armed forces (60 per cent) and business (59 per cent).

The police had the fewest number of leading figures who went to fee-paying schools, with only 13 per cent of chief constables and other senior officers. Fifty-seven per cent of top officers attended grammars.

How to be famous: Who went to which school...

The ten private schools which produced 12 per cent of the professional elite were Eton, Winchester, Charterhouse, Rugby, Westminster, Marlborough, Dulwich, Harrow,  St Paul’s Boys’ School and Well-ington College.

The top comprehensives were Haverstock School in Chalk Farm, North London, which was attended by Ed and David Miliband, and Holland Park in Kensington, where Tony Benn sent his four children. The top grammar school, with 17 former pupils among the country’s leaders, was Watford Grammar, Hertfordshire, which is now a  comprehensive.

High achievers who attended grammar schools included actors Ray Winstone and Emma Thompson, Martin O’Neill, the  Sunderland Football Club manager, and Sir Paul McCartney and Sir  Mick Jagger.

The trend continues: Higher education institutions attended by the most senior people in the UK

Only 10 per cent of the elite attended comprehensives, including James Bond actor Daniel Craig and Foreign Secretary William Hague. Just 1 per cent went to secondary moderns, including actor Colin Firth and Olympic rower Sir Steve Redgrave.

Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust which aims to promote social mobility through education, said: ‘This analysis shows how dominant leading universities and schools remain across the professions in Britain.

‘That’s why it is so important  that access to our leading schools and universities is on the basis of ability alone.

‘We are working to improve social mobility in the early years, schools, universities and professions.

‘But studies like this show how  far we still need to go to improve social mobility and ensure that  every young person can achieve his or her potential, regardless of  their family background.'
