He inspired a generation in the 1980s as television's loveable wheeler-dealer Arthur Daley, who was always looking for a quick way to make easy money.

But Minder star George Cole is far from happy with his real-life next door neighbour, after he reveled plans to build his own sawmill next to his Oxfordshire property.

His wife Penny - famously referred to as 'er indoors' during the ITV drama - has also taken the news badly and has been prescribed valium to help her cope with the stress.

Mrs Cole said: 'This was our safe place and suddenly it isn't anymore.

'George has fallen and knocked himself and he is on hefty medication for other health problems.

'He has always been very quiet and needs peace and quiet, otherwise he wouldn’t have been here for 70 years.

'At our age we do not socialise except with our children and grandchildren. We never go away, we’re always here.'

Mrs Cole claimed her actor husband, now 88, was nothing like the over-the-top characters he once played on television and film, which included roles in St Trinians.

They fear that if their next-door neighbour, James 
Morris, gets the go-ahead for his 90ft-long barn, which stands 24ft high, and is on the boundary of their properties, their properties, their quality of life will inevitably be affected.

They claim they will be deprived of the 
peace and quiet they have enjoyed up to now and have called for the plan
to be scrapped due to the loss of trees, impact on the environment and 
the noise the development will create.

They are not the only people fighting the plans for the site in South Oxon.

Major General Leslie Busk owns a property with nearly 40 acres of woodland next to the site.

He
said: 'I very much doubt if I could justify setting up a sawmill to 
manage it even if I could get permission to cut the trees down.

'I
am therefore at a loss to understand where he will find the timber 
needed to operate a sawmill of some size, on just five acres of his own 
land, unless he intends to import it.'

Mr Morris explained he was having diseased trees cut down, which were too big for the local sawmill to process, and would have to be cut up on site and stored until they could be removed.

He denied he was setting up the mill as a commercial venture insisting he would only be processing wood from his estate.

He argued his proposal would 
result in less disruption than if lorries had to 
transport the trees from his land.

He added: 'I
am surprised by people’s attitude to woodland management, especially in
an area of such forestation that has many plantations and areas under 
the management of the Forestry Commission, which actively harvests 
trees.'
