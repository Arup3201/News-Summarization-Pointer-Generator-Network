Claims have been made by a prominent Iranian opposition blogger based in London which suggest Iran killed its own nuclear scientist.

Earlier this month Majid Jamali Fashi, 24, was hanged at Tehran's Evin Prison after being sentenced to death for killing the Iranian scientist Masoud Ali Mohammad. 

But blogger Potkin Azarmehr alleges that certain anomalies in his case contribute to a theory held by many activists, that Iranian intelligence agents may have been the cause of his death.

The recent emergence of a passport purported to belong to Mr Fahi has increased suspicions that he was a scapegoat for the killing, while many opposition activists, such as Mr Azarmehr believe that his execution was a staged hoax.

Some Iranian dissidents believe that the country has used the cover of its war with Israel to crack down on internal opponents, with some saying that Mr Mohammadi was killed because he was a supporter of reformist candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi.

Ali-Mohammadi died in January 2010 when a remote-controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle outside his home in Tehran went off.

When Mr Mohammadi died, Iran immediately blamed his murder on the U.S, Israel and their 'hired agents.'

Questions raised: The recent emergence of a passport purported to belong to Mr Fahi has increased suspicions that he was a scapegoat

State television swiftly blamed Israel for the attacks, although it has always denied any role in the scientist’s killing.

But there has always been doubt Mr Mohammadi's death.

A spokesman for Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation said at the time that Mr Mohammadi, a 50-year-old Tehran University professor, was not involved in its activities.

But Western intelligence agencies have had conflicting information about whether Mr Mohammadi was contributing to the nuclear program.

Iranian media broadcast a report which said Mr Fashi had confessed to travelling to Tel Aviv to receive training from Mossad before returning to Iran to plot the assassination.

Paraded on TV, the kickboxer also confessed to receiving forged travel documents in Azerbaijan to travel to Israel, Iran's Press TV reported.

But in a blog post, ABC News reported that Mr Azarmehr has raised questions of the authenticity of Mr Fashi's passport.

The passport was presented on Iranian state television at the weekend as hard evidence that Mr Fashi had been in the pay of Israel.

Claims: A remote-controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle outside the scientist's home in Tehran. Iran blamed it on Mossad

But Mr Azarmehr said that the Israeli passport was stamped 2003, when Mr Fashi would have been 15-year-old.

But the photo was of a man in his 20s, who is looking away from the camera.

The date of birth on the passport is concealed.

'No passport will be issued with such a picture, anywhere in the world,' wrote Mr Azarmehr.

'You need a headshot where you are open-eyed AND looking into the camera.'

Mr Azarmehr writes: 'This is yet another question in the whole series of doubts about what Jamali Fashi's role, if any, in the assassination of Iranian particle physicist, Massoud Ali-Mohammadi was.'

Mr Azarmehr claims that Mr Fashi was not a Mossad agent and may not even have been executed, reported the website.

Mr Azarmehr cites his reasons by noting in earlier posts that Mr Fashi did not appear to be fearful in a video allegedly recorded right before his execution.

He also says that the only official photo taken of him after his hanging shows him from far away so is not easy to make out.

'The only picture of Jamali Fashi's execution which is shown in the video above is blurred and from a distant and it can not be verified that its him.

Isreal is believed to be keeping a close eye on Iran's nuclear capacity. Here is the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran, which is believed to be part of its programme

'Given that the regime is not known for its regard for public sensitivity in seeing pictures of the dead and morbid images, why is it that in this instance they have chosen not to show his pictures?'

His claims have been cited by some news services - Dubai-based news channel al-Arabiya has said that the passport displayed on Iranian television has a misplaced passport number and design features that indicate it dates from the 1990s.

Tehran has accused Israel and the U.S. of assassinating four Iranian scientists since 2010 in order to sabotage its nuclear programme which the West suspects is hiding Iran's attempt to develop a nuclear weapons capability.

While Israel has declined to comment on the killings, it regards Iran's nuclear programme as an existential threat and has threatened military action against Tehran.

Washington has denied any U.S. role.

The most recent attack on an Iranian scientist occurred in January.

Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan - a deputy director of the Natanz uranium enrichment facility - was killed when a magnetic bomb planted on his vehicle detonated.
