Hull City are making a move for £10million-rated Watford striker Troy Deeney after losing Shane Long to Southampton.

Manager Steve Bruce wants pace and power in his attack and sees Deeney as the ideal target having enquired about him at Christmas. 

Target: Hull boss Steve Bruce has long-standing interest in Watford striker Troy Deeney

Leicester have had a £7.5m bid rejected for Deeney while Burnley and QPR have also failed with offers for the 26-year-old.

Long had only joined Hull last January from West Bromwich Albion in a £7million deal with Nikica Jelavic joining also from Everton and the Tigers had been reluctant to sell.

They have, however, turned their attention elsewhere.

On his way: Hull City have accepted a £12m bid from Southampton for forward Shane Long

Hull and Crystal Palace have expressed interest in free agent Nicklas Bendtner but face competition from Bundesliga side Wolfsburg. 

The 26-year-old Dane has an offer from Olympiacos also but the prospect of playing in the Premier League again or the Bundesliga is more appealing.
