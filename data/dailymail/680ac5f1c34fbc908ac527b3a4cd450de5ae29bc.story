Roy Hodgson has cited the 'offside law' that led to England's exit as the only thing that he would change about his side's World Cup campaign.

England arrived home from Brazil on Wednesday after an extremely disappointing tournament that saw them exit at the group stage of a World Cup for the first time since 1958 - taking just a single point in the process.

And upon being asked about any regrets he 
may be bringing back from Brazil, Hodgson referred Steven Gerrard's 
inadvertent assist in the build-up to Luis Suarez's winner for Uruguay 
as his biggest frustration of all.

'It would be changing the offside law so that when the ball skims off someone's head and goes to a player who is yards offside the goal doesn't stand because it's not what I consider to be a backpass,' he mused.

'But I won't be changing any laws of the game.

'That is how small the margins are.'

Hodgson also rounded on the critics who say he should be sacked by highlighting England's attacking performance against Italy.

'If you 
take your mind back after the first game, I seem to remember the general
 consensus and opinion was that the team had done very well and that 
things were looking very bright.

'So
 then we lose 2-1 to Uruguay to a freak goal after a period of 
domination and all of a sudden everything we have done as a team and a 
group in terms of preparation is wrong.'

'We accept we have failed and we will do our best to put it right before 2016.'

'The FA made it very clear after the second game that they wanted me to stay on and lead the team for the next two years.'

'The players and the staff want me to continue and I am very happy to continue.'

'We have seen a lot of good players coming through, the evolution has been very good so we think that the future is actually looking much brighter now than it was some months ago even and we have to hope and rely on the players to take us there.'
