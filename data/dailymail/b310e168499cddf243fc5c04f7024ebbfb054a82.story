Clinics are employing a ‘no questions asked’ approach to gender abortions, a Tory MP claimed yesterday.

Sarah Wollaston accused a leading provider – the British Pregnancy Advisory Service – of misogyny for refusing to condemn doctors who help parents seeking to get rid of a girl.

Dr Wollaston, who is also a GP, said: ‘This is about equality. It’s very harmful and we must be very clear that it’s illegal.’

‘We should not be colluding with an attitude which says that having a girl, or in some cases having a boy, could in any way force someone to become mentally ill.

'If I was seeing a patient who was in a distressed state because they felt they were under pressure from their family to abort a female foetus, I would be very concerned for them.

‘I certainly wouldn’t be colluding in a view that it was the right thing to do for them to go ahead with the termination.’

Ann Furedi, chief executive of BPAS, caused a storm last month by saying doctors are legally free to  terminate pregnancies when the parents are unhappy with the sex of their unborn child.

Writing on the website Spiked, Mrs Furedi said: ‘A doctor agreeing to an abortion on grounds of rape would be breaking the law no more and no less than a doctor who agrees an abortion on grounds of sex selection.

‘While it is true that the sex of the foetus is not a legal ground for abortion, nor is rape, or incest, or being 13 years old.'

Her comments followed the decision not to prosecute two doctors who agreed to arrange abortions – as part of a newspaper probe – for women who said they did not want girls.

The Director of Public Prosecutions said there were grounds for charges but it would not be in the public interest to proceed.

Mrs Furedi said that in ten years at BPAS, she had ‘never heard of a woman walking into clinic and  simply saying I want to have an abortion because I don’t want a girl or I don’t want a boy’.

‘Women who come into the clinics have a whole complex set of reasons why they may want to end the pregnancy and it may very well be that the circumstances of the pregnancy are very much a part of that, for whatever reason,’ she added.

Pressure: Dr Wollaston warns a 'no questions asked' policy ignores the nuances of a woman's feelings

‘The law at the moment works  reasonably well. So if a doctor believes that the woman’s request for an abortion for any reason is best for her, then the doctor can make that referral.

‘Now that to me makes sense, because the doctor believes that she is perhaps so distraught, so strung out, so completely distressed that it is better for her mental health for the doctor to refer her for an abortion.’

Speaking to the Mail, Dr Wollaston said: ‘No woman walks into a clinic and says I want to abort my child because of the sex. But there are times when you can get the sense that a woman is under pressure.

‘If you take a “no questions asked” view, then you are not going to understand that.’
