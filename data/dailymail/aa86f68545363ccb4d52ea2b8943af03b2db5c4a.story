A new reality show is aiming to turn one young man and one young woman into the next big things in the world of adult entertainment.

The Sex Factor puts eight men and eight women who have no prior experience in a Las Vegas home together as they compete for stardom and a $1million prize.

And among the contestants are Wall Street intern Paige Jennings, who goes by the name Veronica Vain, and recently made waves when she announces she was leaving the financial world to pursue her dreams of porn.

Duke University porn star Belle Knox had previously been named as the host, but has now been replaced by Asa Akira.

One of the contestants is Paige Jennings, who goes by the stage name Veronica Vain (above), and made waves when she announced she was leaving finance for porn 

The show is the creation of Buddy Ruben, a former Silicon Valley software developer with no television or porn experience.

'I would say I enjoy porn as much as the next guy, no more, no less,' he said in an interview with Nightline. 

After a casting call went out on social media, finalists came to audition for a panel of judges that include female stars Tori Black, Lexi Belle and Remy LaCroix and the lone male of the group, Keiran Lee.

Lee is a British star famous for having his penis insured for $1million by Lloyd's of London.

Those who made it through the casting process also now have some experience in the business.

'They’ve actually already had sex on camera to audition,' said Ruben.

'Part of the casting process.'

As for the contestants, some have always dreamed of working in the adult film industry, while others are after the money.

'I’m not here because I want to have sex with random people,' explained contestant Allie Knox, which is not her real name. 

'I’m here because I think this will elevate me to the next level. It will drive a lot of traffic for me. It will open a lot of doors.'

She also said; 'I’m sitting on this huge amount of student loan debt. That’s kind of why I just need to really step up on my game in this business.'

The industry has made millions for stars like Jenna Jameson, Tera Patrick and Sasha Grey, and female performers earn between $500 and $1500 for one scene. 

Then there is Buddy Hollywood, a self-proclaimed sex addict, who says of his decision to compete on the show; 'I like to have sex and I love women, everything about them.'

And while contestants won't be paid for being on the show, save the two winners who will also get a three-year porn contract, they are getting tips and guidance from a panel of experts explained Ruben.

As for the show's lack of a network, Ruben teased that he would 'have a big announcement in the near future.'
