Tourists in one of the country's most picturesque regions can now enjoy some of its most famous sites all in one go.

One hundred of the Lake District's top landmarks have been painstakingly recreated as a model village - entirely crafted out of locally sourced slate.

Retired builder Edward Robinson, 67, has spent thousands of hours over the past 25 years making perfectly scaled models of attractions including Beatrix Potter's Hill Top, Bridge House at Ambleside and Townend Farmhouse at Troutbeck.

The village is made using locally sourced slate, from areas including Hodge Close, Coniston and Elterwater

Mr Robinson said he started the project because he wanted to 'put something back' into the area he loved

Edward Robinson has spent a quarter of a century building his collection, he can now expect 6,000 visitors to come and see his handiwork every year

It has taken thousands of hours of work to put the village together but new pieces are still being added

Mr Robinson, 67, said he 'wanted to put something back' into the area he loves.

'I wanted to show how these buildings looked when I was a lad, rather than the plastic windows and everything you see nowadays.'

Rarely using any kind of scaled drawings, much of the designs are in 'his head'.

'I'm not trying to be clever but I just have a knack somehow,' he said.

'It's just in me, I enjoy doing it.'

The grandfather-of-two uses a diamond saw, a hammer, adhesive, sand, cement and a special chisel to faithfully recreate every detail of the buildings.

The retired builder uses photos for the more complex replicas but manages to put many together from memory

Mr Robinson has become too old to use his workshop, so now builds the models at home

He only uses Lake District slate from Hodge Close, Coniston and Elterwater but has to look as far afield as America to find the fake moss he attaches to his designs.

Every March, his wife Kathleen opens their gardens to the public as the Lakeland Miniature Village in Flookburgh.

Fourteen years since they first welcomed in the public, they now expect to pull in around 6,000 visitors annually.

New additions to the collection this year include Windermere's Baddeley Clock, the roadside monument halfway between Bowness and Windermere, and Yew Tree Farm, near Coniston.

The Baddeley Clock model took Mr Robinson three months to make - using old photographs as he went along.

He said: 'It's quite an icon, isn't it? I used to make them in my workshop but I'm too old for that now. In winter, my wife allows me to make them in the house, which is very kind of her.'

Mrs Robinson said: 'I think they're marvellous. It takes a lot of skill and patience. He's a qualified builder and you can see he knows what he's doing.'

As one recent visitor commented in the guest book: 'We have never seen anything like this before - it's absolutely beautiful. The level of craftsmanship is amazing.'

While the slate is all local, Mr Robinson has to ship in the fake moss from as far afield as America
