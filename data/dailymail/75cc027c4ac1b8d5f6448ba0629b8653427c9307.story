With a perfect blend of plump fruit and  spices they are the sophisticated treat of the British Easter - just as delicious as chocolate eggs, but  a little more grown up. 

And one bakery is set to make more than 40 million hot cross buns in the run up to the holiday - enough to stretch 372 miles from Sheffield to Nazareth in Israel if placed end-to-end.

Gunstones Bakery, which produces one third of the nation's hot cross buns, said the run-up to Easter is the busiest week of the year.

A staggering 30  tonnes of flour and 20 tonnes of fruit will be used by the Sheffield bakery to produce a quarter of a million buns every day - which are then sold by M&S.

It has been forced to open a new multi-million pound production line just to cope with the huge increase in demand for the seasonal treat

Gunstones has even been forced to open a new multi-million pound production line just to cope with the huge increase in demand. 

Bakery Production Manager, Richard Johnson, said: 'This year we're making the biggest range ever for M&S, new flavoured buns include berries and cherries, golden syrup and ginger, Bramley apple, a healthy option, and, for the chocoholics, we now make a chocolate hot cross bun - that's my personal favourite!

'If all of our Easter hot cross buns were laid end-to-end, they'd stretch from our bakery near Sheffield to Nazereth.

'This is the busiest week of the year at Gunstones, with buns making their way through giant ovens, proving machines and then making their way along a labyrinth of conveyor belts that crisscross the whole bakery.

M&S expects to sell around 40 million hot cross buns this Easter amid increasing demand

Traditionally eaten on Good Friday – with noon marking the end of Lent – the sweet buns mark the arrival of the long Easter weekend

'At one end of the new production area a giant device resembling a helter-skelter, brings hot cross buns from a conveyor belt near the ceiling, spiralling down sixteen tiers where they are cooled by giant fans before reaching the packaging area below.' 

Traditionally eaten on Good Friday – with noon marking the end of Lent – the sweet buns mark the arrival of the long Easter weekend.

They are said to date back to the 12th Century but were first mentioned in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1733. 

The cross on the bun symbolises the crucifixion of Jesus as the bread represents his body and the spices refer to the cloth saturated with spices that was wrapped around him after his death.
