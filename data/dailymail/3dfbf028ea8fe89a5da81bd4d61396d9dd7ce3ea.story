Gentrification is out as a new phenomenon sweeps the cities of north America.

Instead of neighborhoods gradually increasing in social status, some are now being 'youthified', according to new research.

The trend of youthification describes the growing influx of young adults, those aged between 25-34, into higher density cities.

The cities with the lowest proportion of residents aged 25-34 are clustered in the northeastern rustbelt. Apart from Washington DC those with the highest are all further west, as this map of north America shows

Millennials, those born between the early 1980s and early 2000s, are 'youthifying' cities across north America

The phrase has been coined by Markus Moos, a geographer and urban planner at the University of Waterloo in Canada.  

As reported by citylab.com, Moss describes youthification as different from gentrification - 'a series of stages involving ever slightly wealthier but more risk averse in-movers' - because 'the former is not explicitly a class-based process, although the two are not mutually exclusive.'

Moos explains youthification as a process that occurs in discrete stages.

It begins as younger people move into relatively inexpensive neighborhoods, such as those with spaces leftover from de-industrialized manufacturing districts. 

As youthification continues, newer rental housing and smaller one-bedroom apartments are built and amenities flood the neighborhood, drawing greater numbers of young people even as living costs rise.

Some of these areas remain 'forever young', with new cohorts of young people continuing to move in as families and children head towards the suburbs in search of more space. 

Moos' online project Generationed City charts the most youthified cities in the US and Canada, according to the proportion of 25-34 year-old residents living there.

Salt Lake City tops the list with 16.93 per cent of its population falling into that age category, ahead of Austin, Denver, Washington DC and Seattle. Houston and Las Vegas also rank highly.

Calgary and Edmonton, two rapidly growing cities in western Canada, rank third and fourth while Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto lag behind in 24th, 31st and 33rd place out of the 57 largest metropolitan areas in the US and Canada.

Unsurprisingly the rustbelt cities of Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Rochester, Cleveland and Detroit come at the bottom of the list.

To answer the question of what causes youthification, Moos conducted a detailed statistical analysis of factors that might be associated with the movements of young people - such as household income, household size, the share of potential gentrifiers and the share of immigrants - across Canada's three largest cities between 1981 and 2011.

While Moos finds several factors - including household income, household size and immigration - to be associated with higher density, he found the connection between density and age of residents has increased substantially over time. 

This is true in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. In the former the correlation  between young people (aged 25 to 34) and density - where -1 indicates a total negative correlation, 0 no correlation at all and +1 a total positive correlation - grew from .22 in 1981 to .66 by 2011.

In Toronto, it went from .36 to .62 and in Vancouver it increased from .49 to .68.

The associations between density and older age groups (44-54 and 55-64 years old) have generally moved in the other direction, indicating these individuals are moving toward the lower-density suburbs. 

In Toronto and Montreal, there is a negative correlation between people aged 65 and older and density. 

Salt Lake City in Utah has the highest proportion of young adults than any other north American city

This points to growing geographic segregation of age groups in the city. 

In the case of Vancouver Moos suggests this divide has become a 'generational bifurcation,' where older and young people live in the inner cities and those in middle age live in the less dense suburbs.

He suggests these changes grow out of a number of socio-economic shifts.

Young people in the US and Canada are experiencing less job security, more chinks in the social safety net, high housing prices, delayed childbearing and a growing enthusiasm for urban living. 

For these reasons, renting closer to the city centre, where increasing stocks of terraced housing and apartments are readily available, becomes a more attractive option.

It remains to be seen whether this pattern will last and whether those who move to city centres in their 20s and 30s remain there to raise their children or move out like their predecessors.  

As Moos notes, the generational divide he observes is not nearly as stark as that of ethnic or class segregation.  

But, he adds, 'there are clear signs of a process of youthification underway that is indeed creating generationed spaces in our cities that if intensified in the future could lead to further inter-generational conflict.'
