Athlete: Kirsty Wallace, pictured in 2011, narrowly missed out on a spot in the Olympic team in 2012

The Royal Navy ‘drunken sailor’ paid £1million after injuring her back during alcohol-fuelled antics is now a Paralympic sports star.

Lieutenant Kirsty Wallace, 32, is in Team GB’s wheelchair basketball side and is described as an elite athlete.

Despite fears she would be paralysed from the waist down after the accident seven years ago, she managed to stand with splints after just six weeks and did without her wheelchair to walk down the aisle at her wedding in 2011.

Determined to live life to the full, she is still in the Royal Navy and has even been able to go scuba diving and snowboarding with special equipment.

She narrowly missed out on representing her country at the London 2012 Paralympic Games and has become a poster girl for the navy which celebrates her sporting achievements on its website.

In 2007, Lt Wallace plunged from the top of a human pyramid built by alcohol-fuelled troops as they larked about in the mess.

Following a six-year legal battle she won a payout of £1million – nearly double the maximum £570,000 compensation given by the Ministry of Defence to soldiers with the most severe battlefield injuries such as paratrooper Ben Parkinson.

He lost his legs when he was blown up by a mine in Afghanistan in 2006.

Lt Wallace argued her accident happened at an Armed Forces function on her base on land where top brass had responsibility for her well-being.

But critics said it ‘seemed utter madness’ to pay so much taxpayers’ money when there was ‘at least some negligence on the part of the person concerned’.

Sources told the Daily Mail that 
during the evening Lt Wallace became involved in ‘drunken high jinks’ 
with high-spirited troops climbing on each others’ shoulders.

The human tower collapsed and she fell up to 30ft.

Tests at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth revealed she had broken her back.

Surgeons fused five of the vertebrae together but she was left unable to move her legs and was told she might never walk again.

However, following treatment at a spinal injuries centre, she was able to stand with splints after six weeks.

Then she was treated at Headley Court, the military’s specialist rehabilitation centre for injured servicemen and women, and a year after the accident was well enough to go snowboarding.

In 2010 she went scuba-diving in the Maldives with fellow serviceman Scott Wallace who proposed under water by holding up a board on which he had written: ‘Will you marry me?’

Although she uses a wheelchair, she was determined to leave it to one side when they married in May 2011. Her father Calum Archibald walked her down the aisle at Wedderburn Castle in Berwickshire.

News of her payout sparked controversy as it was nearly double that handed to severely injured paratrooper Ben Parkinson, who lost both his legs when he was blown up by a mine in Afghanistan in 2006

Lt Wallace, who is from Ardrishaig in western Scotland, took up wheelchair basketball in 2009 and made her debut representing Great Britain at the BT Paralympic World Cup in Manchester in May 2011.

In 2012, she was a reserve in the GB women’s basketball team for the London Paralympics.

Last year, she competed for Team GB in the European Wheelchair Basketball Championships in Frankfurt.

The official website of British Wheelchair Basketball says Lt Wallace ‘balances the requirements of being an elite athlete with working full time’.

Until recently she was based in the Communication Information System Training Unit at HMS Collingwood, a land base near Portsmouth.

She and her husband recently moved to the Bristol area, and could not be contacted for comment yesterday.

An MoD spokesman declined to comment.
