A dramatic high-speed chase in which police were forced to weave round bales of marijuana hurled out of a speeding SUV has been caught on camera.

Officers in Mesa, Arizona, were drawn into the 100mph pursuit after a Chevrolet Trailblazer they were trying to stop took off down the I-8 freeway.

Footage from the chase, which took place Wednesday, shows the Trailblazer hurtling along the road as large, green packages are dropped out of the window.

Abandoned cargo: Sheriff's deputies chasing down suspected drug smugglers had to dodge bales of marijuana they dumped out of their SUV

Arrested: Mario Perez-Paz (left) , 43, and Juan Aguilar-Zavala (right), 21, were booked into jail on drugs offenses and unlawful flight

Deputies from the Pinal County sheriff's department and Gila River police officers chased the SUV, which had two men inside, through a university campus before deflating its tires with spikes in the road.

The car then pulled over, and two men fled, but were caught and arrested.

Mario Perez-Paz, 43, Juan Aguilar-Zavala, 21, were then booked into jail on drugs possession, smuggling and dealing charges, as well as unlawful flight.

The sheriff's office said the men claimed they were offered $1,000 by a woman from Phoenix to make the drugs run.

Follow the trail: Deputies say the arrested men then led them to a stash house full of marijuana and illegal immigrants

They also gave officers information that led them to a stash house, where they say they found a huge stash of drugs and 20 illegal immigrants.

However, while officers were able to recover 374lbs of marijuana from the house, they admitted that they never got back the bales dumped on the road - which were instead grabbed by drivers passing by.

Pinal County sheriff Paul Babeu said: 'These foreign drug smugglers try to outrun our deputies and even throw bales of marijuana from their vehicle.

'We caught these criminals who put our deputies and our local citizens in harm’s way and now they will go to prison for their crimes.'
