Merry Christmas Walmart shoppers, your layways have been paid for.

Well, at least if you live in Hastings Michigan that is.

Act of kindness: An anonymous donor called the local Walmart store in Hastings, Michigan, and requested to pay for all layaways

Big donation: The 'Secret Santa' gave the store a $10,000 check and 43 customers had their layaways completely paid for

The donor gave the store a $10,000 check and 43 customers had their layaways completely paid for.

The full payment was about $7,800, local news station 24 Hour News 8 reported.

The Walmart store gave the remaining $2,200 to a local charity.

‘The fact that we have a customer willing to come to our store in Hastings and pay off layaways for other customers in the neighborhood, we're very grateful,’ one of the store’s assistant managers, Derek Waddle, told a reporter.

‘We had one lady who we thought fainted on the phone. When they told her her layaway had been paid off, there was no response for a few minutes,’ said assistant manager Carla Jiles.

‘I don't know what to say. I'm so elated that it was paid off.'

Paid off: The full payment was about $7,800. The Walmart store gave the remaining $2,200 to a local charity.

Touched: ¿God bless ¿em for thinking of others,¿ said one customer

Last year, another ‘Secret Santa’ donated money to pay off three layaway bills at a Kmart store in Michigan’s Plainfield Township, according to 24 Hour News.

The generous offer sparked similar gestures across West Michigan and other parts of the U.S., including a $5,000 gift to pay off layaways at a Kmart store in Hastings.

This year’s donation in Hastings was another recent ‘act of kindness’ following the tragic shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14.

Since then compassionate citizens around the world have been coming up with ways to help others, both within Newtown and outside.
