NAB's latest Residential Property Survey has released the following list of suburbs that are predicted to enjoy above average capital growth 

NSW: Eastwood, Glebe, Manly, Marrickville, Newtown, Oran Park, Penrith, Ryde, Surry Hills, Sydney

VIC: Essendon, Glen Iris, Ringwood

QLD: Brisbane, Gold Coast, Toowoomba, West End

WA: Baldivis, Belmont, Bentley, Kelmscott, Mandurah, Perth, Subiaco

SA: Mile End, Norwood, Parkside 

The inner Sydney city suburbs of Glebe, Newtown, Surry Hills, Sydney and Marrickville made the top 28 list for NSW along with Eastwood, Manly and Ryde in the city's north and Oran Park and Penrith in western Sydney.  

In Queensland, aside from Brisbane and the Gold Coast, the key areas of New Farm, Toowoomba and West End were forecast to see above average price growth.

Esendon, Glen Iris and Ringwood were listed among those in Victoria, while Norwood, Parkside and Mile End topped the list in South Australia. 

Western Australia's central suburbs were also the focus of price growth predictions, with the suburbs of Belmont, Perth, Bentley and Subiaco named as well as Mandurah, Baldivis and Kelmscott just south of the capital.

But it's Brisbane that is expected to take the limelight from Sydney in 2015, with a predicted 5.7 per cent capital growth in house prices compared to Sydney's 4.1 per cent, Melbourne's 2.7 per cent, Adelaide's 2.1 per cent and Perth's 1.8 per cent.

This property at New Farm in Queensland is on the market for $929,000. New Farm topped NAB's list of suburbs

In 2016, growth is expected to slow substantially as the 'housing market looses steam', according to NAB's report (pictured: Surry Hills)

The report predicts that house price growth (like this property in Sydney's Surry Hills) will continue to moderate because of rising unemployment, sluggish household income growth, affordability concerns, cost of living pressures and high levels of household debt

In 2016, growth is expected to slow substantially as the 'housing market looses steam', but Brisbane will still take the lead at 3.8 per cent, followed by Sydney and Melbourne at an equal 2.3 per cent.

'With more signs emerging that the residential housing market is loosing steam, NAB Economics expects average capital city house prices to cool to around four per cent over the year to end-2015 and two per cent over the year to end-2016,' the report stated.

'Our assessment of the market remains that house price growth will continue to moderate because of rising unemployment, sluggish household income growth, affordability concerns, cost of living pressures and high levels of household debt.

'We are also forecasting two further interest rates cuts of 25 bps in March and 25 bps in August 2015 (bringing the official cash rate down to two per cent) which should support house prices a little more than previously expected.'

The Gold Coast, which is the location of this stunning home worth $3.7 million, is one of the Queensland suburbs predicted to enjoy above average capital growth

Areas, like this home in Newtown, Sydney were selected by more than 300 panellists including real estate agents and property developers

The NAB report highlighted that housing affordability, construction costs and a lack of development sites were seen as the biggest constraints in new housing market, while employment security and price levels were the biggest weakness to buying an established property.

Foreign buyers in the new property market were less active in all states except for Victoria where they accounted for one in three of all sales, according to the report. 

About 53 percent of foreign purchases were for apartments, 31 percent for houses and 16 percent for re-development.
