It's only three days in, with some of the biggest acts still to come.

But for the models catwalking at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Fall 2015 in New York City, things are in full swing.

There's early starts, late finishes, mad rushes through Manhattan from show-to-show, and a never-ending stream of hair-and-make-up chairs.

However, a look at some of the clothes horse's social media snaps show the event to be predictably glamorous and, in some cases, surprisingly normal.

Saturday looked set to be a busy day for the models, with no hope of breaking for Valentine's Day.
