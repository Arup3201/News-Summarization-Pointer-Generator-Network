When: Saturday November 8, 2.30pm

Where: Twickenham Stadium, London

What: QBE Series opener

England have named Semesa Rokoduguni on the right wing for Saturday's QBE Series opener against New Zealand at Twickenham.

The uncapped Rokoduguni, a serving soldier in the British Army with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards who has seen action in Afghanistan's Helmand Province as a tank driver, has been rewarded for an outstanding start to the season at Bath.

Rokoduguni will become the first serving soldier to win an international cap for England since Tim Rodber 15 years ago. His Test debut will complete an epic journey from his Fijian village, Naselai, where he couldn’t break into the rugby team because his uncle was a better winger.

England: M Brown (Harlequins); S Rokoduguni (Bath), B Barritt (Saracens), K Eastmond (Bath), J May (Gloucester); O Farrell (Saracens) , D Care (Harlequins); J Marler (Harlequins), D Hartley (Northampton), D Wilson (Bath), D Attwood (Bath), C Lawes (Northampton), T Wood (Northampton), C Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), B Vunipola (Saracens).

Replacements: R Webber (Bath), M Mullan (Wasps), K Brookes (Newcastle), G Kruis (Saracens), B Morgan (Gloucester), B Youngs (Leicester), G Ford (Bath), A Watson (Bath).

'I'm delighted for Roko. Wing is an extremely competitive position, but he has pushed himself forward with his form this season and it's great to be able to give him this opportunity,' head coach Stuart Lancaster said.

Rokoduguni is one of three uncapped players in the 23 with Bath team-mate Anthony Watson offering back-three cover from the bench and George Kruis of Saracens the second-row replacement.

Dave Attwood, one of seven Bath players in the matchday squad, starts at lock after his fiancee gave birth to their first child on Tuesday.

'I'm sure Anthony and George will contribute should they come off the bench. Dave Attwood has had an eventful week with the birth of his first child. He's back with us now and will be ready to go for Saturday,' Lancaster said. 

England have selected a previously untried centre pairing of Kyle Eastmond - the Aviva Premiership's form player - and Brad Barritt.

Eastmond experienced mixed fortunes during the summer tour to New Zealand, excelling in the first Test only to be replaced at half-time of the third when his defensive frailties were exposed.

Barritt's inclusion at outside centre provides England with an insurance policy as Lancaster views the Saracens midfielder as best defensive back in the Premiership.

Jonny May of Gloucester fills the left wing slot despite a disappointing tour of New Zealand which placed his international future in doubt.

Danny Care and Owen Farrell form the half-backs with Farrell chosen despite being restricted to only two starts for Saracens this season because of a thigh strain.

England's pack, which has been decimated by injuries to the tight five, picked itself once the respective calf and thigh injuries carried by props David Wilson and Joe Marler cleared up.

Attwood was the next in line to partner Courtney Lawes in the second row after Joe Launchbury was ruled out of the entire autumn schedule with a neck problem.

Billy Vunipola has held off the number eight challenge from Ben Morgan to start in the back row with Chris Robshaw leading the team.

England host New Zealand on Saturday before facing further autumn appointments with South Africa, Samoa and Australia.

Dan Carter has missed out on a place in New Zealand's match-day 23 for the clash at Twickenham on Saturday.

The superstar fly-half made his return from serious injury with a 30-minute appearance during New Zealand's 74-6 victory over the United States in Chicago last weekend.

But All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen has decided to take no chances on Carter in a game of such magnitude, with Aaron Cruden wearing the No 10 shirt and Beauden Barrett providing bench cover.

Cruden, full-back Israel Dagg, centre Sonny Bill Williams and No 8 Kieran Read are the only players retained on starting duty from five days ago.

Hansen's team and replacements boast a combined total of more than 1,000 caps.

Among those who return to the starting XV are prolific try-scoring wing Julian Savea, centre Conrad Smith, lock Sam Whitelock and skipper Richie McCaw.

'This Test match is a great opportunity to once again experience the atmosphere of Twickenham and to lay down a marker of where we are currently at in relation to our opponents, England,' Hansen said.

'We are extremely excited about this challenge and looking forward to it immensely.

'Having played England already three times this year, at the beginning of our season, and again having the opportunity to play them at the end of season, will tell us a lot about how much our game has progressed.'

England suffered a 3-0 Test series defeat in New Zealand earlier this year, but they beat the All Blacks 38-21 at Twickenham two years ago after second-half tries from Brad Barritt, Chris Ashton and Manu Tuilagi secured a famous victory.
