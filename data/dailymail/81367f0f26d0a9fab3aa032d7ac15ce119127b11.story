A group of young elite rowers have stripped down to show off their cheeky sides in a bid to raise money to slingshot athletes towards the Olympics.

The male and female teammates from Mosman Rowing Club in Sydney's north have posed alongside each other for a charity calendar. 

Rowena Meredith, 19, spearheaded the campaign and roped in 15 of her squad members to pose naked and partially-clothed with her.

Teammates from Mosman Rowing Club in Sydney's north (Jessie Allen, Jen Horton, Serena Cox, Rowena Meredith, Georgie Gotch) have posed alongside each other for a charity calendar

The calendar - Mosman Rowers are Oarsome 2015 - was inspired by the annual famous charity calenders created by the British university rowing club, Warwick Rowers.

'The photos are really lively and happy - everyone enjoyed the moment. It was great fun,' Ms Meredith told Daily Mail Australia.

'I haven't heard any negative comments about it, it's gone down really well. I've never done anything like this before.' 

The three-time national medal winner asked her professional photographer dad Chris to get involved and shoot the calendar.

The charity calendar was created to raise money to send athletes overseas to compete

'We tried out a bunch of different things and got people's best angles,' she said. 'It was just a fun initiative to try and get some money back in the club.' 

'It was a fair bit easier to convince the boys, it was a little bit hard at first (with the girls). They warmed up to the idea when they realised the benefits will be going back towards us.

'We did the boys in one day so people didn't get uncomfortable and we went from there.

'My dad is a great photographer and is used to working with people and making them feel comfortable.'

The club printed off 100 calendars to start with and have already raised $2,000.

It costs more than $7,000 to send one rower overseas to compete so the athletes are trying to raise as much as possible

The boys were easier to convince to pose for the calendar than the girls, according to Rowena Meredith 

It costs more than $7,000 to send one rower overseas to compete so the athletes are trying to raise as much as possible, according to Ms Meredith.

'The club tries to endorse people so we're trying to put money back into the club,' she said.

'This is a fundraiser to slingshot people into the Olympics, if we could raise enough to send just one person that would be amazing.

The full-time rower, who is due to start university this year, hasn't ruled out posing for another calendar if the 2015 one is financially successful.
