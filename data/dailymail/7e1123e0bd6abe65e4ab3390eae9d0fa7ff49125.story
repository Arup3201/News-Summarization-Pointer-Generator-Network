They always say hemlines rise with the stock market, so the return of the short skirt on the High Street, the catwalk and celebrities everywhere must be a cracking good sign for the economy.

A good thing, too: they’re fun, fashionable and feminine.

The only thing is that dealing with a deficit of skirt fabric is no easy matter — especially when, like me, you’re over 40 and a mum of three. There’s the key ‘how short is too short?’ question (depends on height and leg shape) and the issues of cut, colour and fabric. Of course, the dangers are manifold. You definitely don’t want to go so short that you become a ‘1661’ (those who look 16 from the back, but 61 from the front) or become a walking advertisement for your mid-life crisis.

Here, we pick from the crop of High Street offerings to see which are short and sweet — and which should be given short shrift.

 LOVELY LEATHER

Leather skirt, £153, tedbaker.com

Shirt, £54.95, massimodutti.com

Black courts, £65, dunelondon.com

I thought leather and short would turn a mid-life crisis into a catastrophe. But as the colour is discreet and the cut is a subtle flare rather than fitted, it’s almost dignified. It would be even more flattering with my beloved black opaque tights...4/5

PUFFY AND DATED 

LK Bennett sweater, £165, johnlewis.com

Skirt, £45, oasis-stores.com 

Courts, £58, topshop.com

This ‘bell’ shape puffs out like an upside-down flower, which should make your legs look thinner. But it reminds me of the puffballs of the Eighties, which made me look like a blob. 2/5

RED DELIGHT

Red skirt, £35, marksandspencer.com

Top, £44.95, massimodutti.com

Necklace, £80, stelladot.co.uk

Boots, £495, russellandbromley.co.uk

This skirt is well-made, with a hidden zip, two pockets and proper lining. It’s a steal at the price and you could dress it up or down. It would be hard to be negative wearing this — but don’t stand too close to a post box! 3/5

TWEED TREAT 

Jigsaw skirt, £68, johnlewis.co.uk

Burgundy blouse, £35, marksandspencer.com

Shoes, £149, reiss.com

This jewel-toned A- line skirt is a lovely cut, lined with a concealed zip. The sparkly tweediness feels a little Chanel-like. You could wear it with cashmere, or a shirt and jacket. It would do you for the office, a party or parents’ evening. Pricier than some, but worth it. My favourite. 5/5

GOLD AWARD 

Metallic skirt, £35, and beaded top, £35, marksandspencer.com

Sandals, £175, russellandbromley.co.uk

An ‘event’ skirt: a party staple that looks as if you’ve made an effort. It felt beautifully expensive: I’d never have guessed it was M&S. Just don’t wear it with any more gold because you’ll look like an oligarch’s wife. 5/5

FLARED FUN

Grey skirt, £18, asos.com

Sweater, £95, and shoes, £159, reiss.com

This fine knit skater skirt is a flattering shape, but it has a very thin fabric with no waistband to speak of and no zip. You just pull it on like a sock. On the hanger, it looks as if it will be unforgiving, but it actually works well with a draped top, which suits me as I dislike tucking things in. The streamlined, fitted body of the skirt with a flared hem is more flattering than a full-on bell shape. 4/5
