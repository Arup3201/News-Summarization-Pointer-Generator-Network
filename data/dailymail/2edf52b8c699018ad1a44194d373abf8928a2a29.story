Universities are paying agencies millions to recruit overseas students who boost their coffers.

Home students suffer as lectures are dumbed down to help those with poor English, academics say.

And some institutions enrol lucrative non-EU students ‘regardless of their language skills’, it was claimed.

A study by Times Higher Education (THE) found 106 universities spent £86million recruiting abroad in 2013 to 2014, or £1,767 per student – a 16.5 per cent increase on two years before.

The Russell Group of top universities were some of the top spenders, with Sheffield, Glasgow and Cardiff each spending more than £6million from 2011 to 2014. Coventry spent the most, paying out £10.2million in commission and VAT to recruit 5,634 students, according to data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. However, a university spokesman said: ‘By error the figures . . . included substantial non-agent related costs, and therefore do not represent the university’s spend.’

The University of Bedfordshire spent £9.5million and Middlesex University spent £8.8million including VAT.

Giving money to recruitment agents is worthwhile for institutions because the average fee paid by a student from outside the EU last year was £11,289 – or £13,425 for laboratory-based courses. Fees for UK and EU students are capped at £9,000 a year.

Liz Reisberg, formerly of the Centre for International Higher Education, at Boston College in the US, and now an independent consultant, told THE the situation was ‘staggering’.

Of 158 universities that gave data, all but 19 used agents to enrol non-EU students. At the 124 institutions that gave a breakdown of admissions, there were 58,257 international students enrolled using agents in 2013-14.

This month, a separate THE survey found more than a third of academics thought foreign undergraduates did not speak or write good English.

One admitted to The Best University Workplace Survey that tutors ‘lower the level of classes so everyone can keep up – to the disadvantage of native speakers’. A Russell Group lecturer called the issue the sector’s ‘dirty little secret’.

A respondent at a university in the Midlands said it tried ‘to attract as many international students as possible regardless of their language skills.’

As the survey was anonymous, there is no suggestion the complaints came from institutions that pay agencies fees to recruit internationally.

Nicola Dandridge, of Universities UK, which represents the sector, said: ‘International students are subject to numerous tests to ensure they meet high English language requirements.’

The group said official guidance puts an onus on universities to ensure agents act ‘ethically and responsibly’.
