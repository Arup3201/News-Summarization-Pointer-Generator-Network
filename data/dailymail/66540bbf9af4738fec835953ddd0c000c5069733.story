Joe Hart is used to being in nets - but Manchester City's No 1 is not usually kitted out in pads, batting gloves and helmet.

The England keeper was pictured at Old Trafford (not that one) on Friday wearing cricket gear as he batted at a promotional event.

It may seem a bit risky just two days before the Manchester derby but Hart was an accomplished schoolboy cricketer and could have played at county level for Worcestershire.

Or maybe he was trying on the protective clothing in preparation for facing the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria on Sunday.  

Earlier this week Hart said City have nothing to worry about despite their three-match winless spell.

He said: 'This is one of those difficult patches we've gone through many a time and as he pointed out, last season we had less points and were in a worse position (at this stage) and we won the league. We've got to look to things like that but the main thing is to get it right on Sunday.' 

Jos Buttler also swapped sports as he trained with Hart at City's training base and then the two England keepers chatted in the indoor school at Old Trafford.

And Hart has clearly still got a good eye as Buttler signed a T-shirt for him with the message, 'wasted as a footballer'.
