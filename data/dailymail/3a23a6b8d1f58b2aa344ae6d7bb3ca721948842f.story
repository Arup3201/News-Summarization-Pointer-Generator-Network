Texas Republican Representative Ralph Hall, 90, spent more than $33,000 in campaign donations on high-end hams and chocolates.

According to Federal Election Commission records, Hall, the oldest serving member of Congress, spent more than $14,000 on HoneyBaked hams around the holiday season in 2012 and 2013, and a further $19,000 at Godiva in December 2013.

During the holiday season, many constituents receive gifts from their members of Congress such as cards, ornaments or trinkets from the House gift shop.

Hamming it up: Congressman Ralph Hall gives very tasty gifts to his supporters

Campaign money may be spent on gifts for constituents, though the House Ethics Committee states that the items should be 'of a nominal value.'

'Such gifts,' the Ethics Committee guidance states, 'may include the relatively inexpensive House or Capitol souvenir items sold by the House gift store or the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, and thus a Member may use campaign funds to purchase such nominal-value gifts for the Member’s supporters or contributors.'

It's unclear whether Belgian Godiva chocolates and seven-pound hams are considered nominal-value gifts.

No hard feelings: Hall even sent a ham to his rival John Ratcliffe

'These are gifts that the congressman has been giving out for years to constituents,' said Ed Valentine, one of Hall’s campaign advisers, reports BuzzFeed.

'They’re Christmas gifts. They’re birthday gifts. That’s how Ralph works. He likes Christmas.'

Hall even sent a ham to former U.S. Attorney John Ratcliffe, who is running against the nonagenarian.

A spokesman for Ratcliffe said Hall sent the Tea Party member a seven-pound baked ham after he announced he was running against the incumbent.

'After six votes to increase the debt ceiling, and support for bloated farm bills, cash for clunkers and billions in earmarks, this level of questionable spending from Ralph Hall is unfortunately not surprising,' Ratcliffe spokesperson Daniel Kroese told BuzzFeed.
