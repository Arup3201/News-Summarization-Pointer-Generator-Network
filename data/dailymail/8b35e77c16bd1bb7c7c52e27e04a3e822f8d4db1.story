Gordon Ramsay is being sued by a Manhattan accounting firm for unpaid bills totalling $75,000, it was reported today.

The celebrity chef, 46, and his businesses owe the firm the money for three unpaid invoices dating back to 2010 and 2011.

Marks, Paneth & Shron say the British personality and his companies have 'breached their contractual obligations by failing to make payment'.

Ramsay, who is temporarily based in Los Angeles, is said to owe them three payments of $14,000 for work in July 2010, $35,000 in May 2011, and $25,000 from October 2011.

The foul-mouthed chef, whose shows Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen have won him fame on both sides of the Atlantic, has not refuted the bills but has not paid them yet either, according to the New York Post.

A spokesman for his firm told the paper she was unaware of the lawsuit from the Third Avenue-based firm.

Father-of-four Ramsay was last year deemed the highest-earning chef in the world, with an estimated global income of $38m in the year to June 2012.

Next richest was Rachael Ray, who earned an estimated $25m in the same period, followed by Austrian-born Wolfgang Puck, who earned around $20m.
