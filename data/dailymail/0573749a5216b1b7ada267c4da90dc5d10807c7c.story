Police interviewed 150 suspects over the shooting death of police informer Terence Hodson and his wife in Melbourne, an inquest has heard.

In 2004, Mr Hodson was due to give evidence in a criminal trial against two drug squad members when he and his wife were shot in the head at their Kew home - in Melbourne's east.

A long-awaited coronial inquest into their deaths on Wednesday heard a file containing information Mr Hodson had provided to police was circulated among criminals.

The inquest is investigating the shooting death of Terence Hodson and Christine Hodson that happened in 2004

Counsel assisting the inquest Chris Winneke said the Hodsons were victims of cold-blooded murder.

'It is unarguable that they had been callously murdered,' he said.

The Hodsons' daughters Mandy Hodson and Nikki Komiazyk both wept as details of their parents' deaths were read to the court.

Outside the court, Mandy told The Age the siblings found the information 'very distressing' and did not know what to expect.

'Who knows at this stage? But we thought it was going to be adjourned today and it wasn’t. We’ll press on,' she said.

Mr Winneke said police had interviewed or investigated 150 persons of interest in relation to the murder.

Former drug squad detective Paul Dale and convicted killer Rodney Collins were charged with the Hodsons' murder in 2009, but the charges were dropped in 2010 after the bashing death of Carl Williams in jail.

Both men maintain their innocence.

Mr Winneke said the inquest would focus on the adequacy of security given to the Hodsons as well as the identity and motive of their killers.

He said thousands of hours of investigation had yet to yield a result.

Mr Winneke said Mr Hodson had refused to join the witness protection program, but had installed security doors and a video camera at his house, carried a gun and had two German shepherd guard dogs.

After the murder, one of the dogs was found to have suffered blunt trauma to its head, while tapes from the cameras had gone missing, Mr Winneke said.

Mr Winneke said the inquest would also examine what inducements were offered to gangland killer Carl Williams to give evidence against Mr Dale.

Before his death in 2010, Williams gave a statement in which he said Mr Dale had given him $150,000 at a home in Essendon to hire a hitman to murder Mr Hodson.

Lawyers for Collins and Mr Dale will apply on Thursday for both to be excused from giving evidence at the inquest.

Collins, 69, is serving two life sentences for the shooting murders of Ramon and Dorothy Abbey at their Melbourne home in July 1987.
