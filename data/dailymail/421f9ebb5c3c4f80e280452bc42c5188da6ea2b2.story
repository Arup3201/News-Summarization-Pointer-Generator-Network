Even Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos got in on the act. He tweeted: 'Dismayed at the death of Robbie Williams. I always liked his songs.' 

However, Harvinth Skin was not impressed with the errors. He tweeted: 'Hi. Please don't embarrass yourself. Robin Williams and Robbie Williams aren't the same people. Thanks.'
