Professor Stephen Hawking has helped to halt plans for a three-storey extension to a riverside hotel in Cambridge after protesting it would ruin views of the university.

The Doubletree by Hilton planned to build 31 extra bedrooms and a new leisure centre on Sheep's Green and Coe Fen by the river Cam in Cambridge.

But campaigners including the A Brief History of Time author and comedian Griff Rhys Jones argued that the new build would ruin the historic view of Cambridge University, where they both studied.

Cambridge City Council planners agreed with the famous alumni, as well as more than 800 petitioners, and rejected the appeal by hotel owners Ability Hotels last month.

Planning inspector Simon Berkeley, from Cambridge City Council, said the extension would detract 'from the pleasure to be had by lingering to appreciate the more panoramic views of the historic centre.'

He added: 'Protruding substantially into an area otherwise largely comprising green open space, it would stand out and appear intrusive.'

Jane Singleton, chairman of the Residents' Association of Old Newnham, said she was 'absolutely delighted' by the ruling.

She said: 'The hotel's extension would have blocked the view - effectively drawing a heavy curtain - between Coe Fen and Sheep's Green.

'These two ancient fenlands are an integral part of the fingers of green which penetrate the city.

'They are not parks but are uncultivated areas which bring the country - and the cows - right to the city's centre. Their openness must be preserved.'

Cllr Rod Cantrill, who represents Newnham on Cambridge City Council, said: 'This is great news, not just for Newnham but also for the city in general, as Coe Fen and Sheep's Green form a unique green space close to the heart of the city.'

Ability Hotels, which owns the Doubletree, applied for planning permission for a similar scheme in 2010 but it was rejected.

Planning officers said the expansion would have an adverse impact on nearby conservation areas.

The second project was designed to sit further back from the River Cam and be clad in brick and includes tree planting.

But the application was refused by Cambridge City Councillors last year and the appeal by Ability Hotels was rejected on March 22.

Ability Hotels argued in the appeal that the leisure centre currently on the plot had 'little architectural merit.'

It said the extension would 'respond positively to the historic surroundings' and would unlock 'significant economic investment.'

But campaigners said the group's plans for the hotel did not include adequate provision for increased traffic.

The no campaign described the design as 'fussy and lacking coherence' and said the extension was 'unacceptable by virtue of its height, scale, mass and bulk, the material of its construction and its position on the site'.

The Ability Group declined to comment.
