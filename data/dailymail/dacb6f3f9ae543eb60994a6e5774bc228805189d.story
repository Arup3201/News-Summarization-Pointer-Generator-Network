New York police commissioner William Bratton has urged officers not to turn their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio at this weekend's funeral.

On Sunday, the city's cops will gather to pay their respects to Wenjian Liu, who was fatally shot on December 20 along with his partner Rafael Ramos.

The double killing prompted a wave of anger from a faction of the NYPD who blamed De Blasio for failing to defend them during the recent anti-police protests.

And last weekend, at officer Ramos's funeral, thousands of officers turned their backs to demonstrate their frustration during De Blasio's eulogy.

Pre-empting a repeat, Bratton sent a message to his force branding the protest 'inappropriate' and saying it detracted from attention on Ramos.

The message read by the New York Post stated: 'A hero's funeral is about grieving, not grievance.

'I issue no mandates and I make no threats of discipline. But I remind you that when you don the uniform of this department, you are bound by the tradition, honor, and decency that go with it.

Protest: Thousands of officers turned their backs during De Blasio's eulogy at Rafael Ramos' funeral

'The country’s consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a fraction of those…officers,' he said.

'All officers were painted by it, and it stole the valor, honor, and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of detective Rafael Ramos’s life and service. 

'That was not the intent, I know. But it was the result.'

Last Saturday, the New York City Police Department buried a hero.

Tens of thousands of officers from our department and hundreds of other departments came to show respect for detective first grade Rafael Ramos.

His family witnessed the kind of love that only his second family in blue could display.

But for the last seven days, the city's and the country's consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a portion of those tens of thousands of officers.

It was not all the officers, and it was not disrespect directed at Detective Ramos.

But all the officers were painted by it, and it stole the valor, honor, and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of Detective Rafael Ramos's life and sacrifice.

That was not that intent, I know. But it was the result.

On Sunday, we will gather together again, with the rest of New York City and law-enforcement officials nationwide, to mourn for Detective First Grade Wenjian Liu.

We gather to support his parents, his widow, and everyone who is there to remember a life tragically cut short.

The assassination of Detectives Liu and Ramos was an attack on us all.

As a cop, one who lived and worked through the assassination threats of the 1970s, I understand that emotions are high.

I issue no mandates, and I make no threats of discipline.

But I remind you that when you don the uniform of this department, you are bound by the tradition, honor, and decency that go with it.
