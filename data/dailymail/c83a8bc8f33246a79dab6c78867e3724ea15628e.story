The daughter of murdered schoolteacher Ann Maguire will join leading musicians and ballet dancers to host a special gala night in her mother's honour.

Emma Maguire, 30, will be joined by world-renowned ballet dancer and Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell and dancer Jonathan Cope to host the first Ann Maguire Gala next month.

The evening will be in memory of Mrs Maguire, 61, who was stabbed to death as she taught a Spanish class at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April last year.

William Cornick, who was 15 at the time, pleaded guilty to the killing on the day he was due to stand trial and was handed a 20-year minimum prison sentence. 

Mrs Maguire, who was loved and respected by pupils, parents and colleagues, had taught at the school for 40 years and planned to retire just weeks after she was killed.

Following her death, her widow Don and daughters Emma and Kerry described her murder as a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil' and said they were 'looking to the future with fragile hope'.

Now, just 10 months on they are planning to host a special night in her honour.

The gala, which is to be held at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London on Sunday March 22, will feature music and dance and will raise money for the Ann Maguire Arts Education Fund.

Emma, a Royal Ballet soloist who has starred in a host of famous ballet productions including The Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty, said: 'My mother was an inspirational teacher for generations of young people in Leeds.

'As a family we felt that setting up a charity that continues her dedication to helping young people is what she would have wanted.

'We are eternally grateful to all the artists who agreed to come together to make the inaugural Ann Maguire Gala possible, an event which not only launches a new charity but will also honour our mother.'

The evening will feature performances from the classical ballet repertoire including works by Frederick Ashton and Kenneth MacMillan, Royal Ballet Artist in Residence Liam Scarlett and Director of the National Romanian Ballet Company Johan Kobborg.

It will also feature a touching performance by Emma herself, who will be joined by fellow members of The Royal Ballet Marcelino Sambé and Valentino Zucchetti as she dances to Johan Kobborg's Les Lutins.

Royal Ballet Principal Steven McRae will also dance the London premiere of his tap solo Czardas at the event.

All money raised from the event will be donated to the Ann Maguire Arts Education Fund, which was set up by the Maguire family and supports the development of young people through arts education.
