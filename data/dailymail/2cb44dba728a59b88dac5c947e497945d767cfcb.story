A pioneering scientist hailed as the 'godfather of ecstasy' for creating the dance drug in its modern form has died aged 88.

For more than 40 years Alexander Shulgin experimented at his home in Berkley, California, testing his chemical creations on himself, friends and family before they could be outlawed.

Last night his wife and research partner, Ann, said he had died peacefully while listening to Buddhist meditation music after being diagnosed with liver cancer.

Pioneer: Dr Alexander Shulgin refined the composition of MDMA, which had been created in 1912, and turned it into a form which much more closely resembled the ecstasy of today. In just a few years it flooded nightclubs

Venerated: Though a controversial figure for many, Dr Shulgin was revered by those in favour of legalisation

Thanking his fans for their support, she wrote: 'Sasha died today, at exactly 5 o'clock in the afternoon.

'He was surrounded by family and caretakers and Buddhist meditation music, and his going was graceful, with almost no struggle at all. Thanks to all of you, and Blessings.'

She previously wrote: 'Sasha knows that he's dying, but that doesn't bother him.

'He doesn't know he has cancer of the liver, and there's no need for him to know; that knowledge would give him nothing useful.

'After all, as he has said, "We all have to die of something!"'

Dr Alexander 'Sasha' Shulgin refined the composition of MDMA, which had been created in Germany in 1912, and turned it into a form which much more closely resembled the ecstasy of today.

In just a few years the drug had flooded the nightclubs of the world and was closely associated with the party island of Ibiza.

But the early life of Dr Shulgin, the son of a Russian immigrant, was more humble and mainstream.

After gaining a doctorate in biochemistry from the University of California, he began working for the giant Dow Chemical Company in the late 1950s.

While he developed industrial chemicals in his day job - including the world's first biodegradable pesticide - his time off became increasingly devoted to researching psychoactive compounds.

He synthesised and fine-tuned hundreds of drugs, most famously methyl-enedioxy-methylamphetamine (MDMA).

Although the drug was more than half a century old, he was the first person to extensively test its effects on the brain.

He was astounded by the results - and word of the formula quickly spread around the world.

He became celebrated among those campaigning for drugs to be legalised, and wrote several books.

The drug shot its way into national headlines after the death of Essex teenager Leah Betts, below, who took just one tablet at her 18th birthday party in 1995.

An inquest heard she died of swelling on the brain because she drank too much water to counter the effects of the drug.

Toxicologist Professor John Henry told the inquest: 'If Leah had taken the drug alone she might well have survived. If she had drunk the amount of water alone she would have survived.'

The verdict - used as ammunition by both sides of the drugs debate - was all too common.

Although ecstasy has been mentioned on dozens of death certificates, it is notoriously difficult to determine whether the drug alone is responsible because of other factors.

The debate has since shifted to more powerful drugs in the same family, which are often sold as ecstasy with devastating results.

In October an inquest heard how Bolton car welder Chris Goodwin, 30, and his friend Emma Johnson, 21, died within minutes of each other after taking up to five times a lethal dose of Para-Methoxyamphetamine (PMA) - almost certainly without realising what it was.

A spokesman for drug advice service Frank said: 'A big problem with ecstasy is that it’s rarely pure. Sometimes, there is no MDMA at all. Sometimes, it contains other drugs, like PMA, which can be fatal.

'Regardless of what it looks like and what it is called, you can’t be sure what’s in a pill or a powder and you can’t predict how you’ll react.'

But he 
became a controversial figure after the death of Leah Betts, an Essex 
schoolgirl who died after taking a single tablet of ecstasy at her 18th 
birthday party.

A
 2001 profile in the Mail on Sunday described him as a 
grandfather-of-five who walked with a fragile shuffle, drove a battered 
VW and had passion for Mozart which included playing the viola.

At the time - when fears over the drug in Britain were at their height - he said: 'If they keep it a Class A drug it is sad but I am heartened there has been a debate over lessening controls.

'It demonstrates a slow shifting of attitude. It may take time but Britain will eventually realise there's no danger from ecstasy.

He added: 'I think it's very healthy to explore the legalisation of cannabis, to see if it helps or hurts. The real trouble comes from the social damage done by enforcing these unfair laws which break up families when drug users are jailed.

'People are hurt far more by that than by the drugs.'

At one time he was venerated by the U.S. establishment, writing the classic reference book Controlled Substances, A Chemical And Legal Guide To Federal Drugs Laws.

But when Dr Shulgin pronounced his personal belief in psychedelics and advocated that all drugs should be legalised, officials changed their tune.

Federal drugs agents raided his lab, took away most of his equipment and revoked his permit.

In 1995, Dr Shulgin expressed regret that the drug - banned in the U.S. in 1986 - had attracted controversy.

'These rave scenes have added kindling to the fire of governmental disapproval,' he said. 'Its very excellent potential for being used as medicine has been badly jeopardised.'
