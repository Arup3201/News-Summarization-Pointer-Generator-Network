Happy to go: Benoit Paire, 25, said he 'hates' Wimbledon because the atmosphere 'displeases him greatly' and said he preferred playing on clay

After months of preparation, there will no doubt be sore losers aplenty at Wimbledon.

And one French player is surely already in the running to be named the sorest of them all – although he would deny it.

Benoit Paire yesterday insisted he was happy after crashing out in the first round of the men’s singles because he ‘hates’ Wimbledon.   

The world number 71 told French sports newspaper L'Equipe: ‘I’m not at all sad to leave this place where the atmosphere displeases me greatly.

‘Simply, I hate Wimbledon and I’m happy to leave as soon as possible.’

The 25-year-old sportsman added that he felt discomfort in his knee while playing on grass - and that clay is a better surface for him.

Paire has previously done well at the competition, reaching the third round on his last two visits.

He also reached the third round of the French Open last year, when he was ranked number 24, and the final of the Serbian Open in 2012.

Both tournaments are played on his favourite surface, clay. But this season he has lost all three of his grass-court singles matches.

Paire was beaten in four sets on Tuesday by Lukas Rosol, who will now play Rafael Nadal.

And
 the Frenchman was dealt another blow yesterday when he was beaten in 
the men’s doubles with partner Tomasz Bednarek against Aleksandr 
Nedovyesov and Dmitry Tursunov.
