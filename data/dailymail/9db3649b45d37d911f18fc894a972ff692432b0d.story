A woman who admitted impersonating singer Alison Krauss to swindle money from a 75-year-old man has been re-arrested after missing a court date for violating her probation.

Peggy Sue Evers, from New Mexico, married Don Fulton from Fayetteville, Arkansas in 2013 after convincing him that she was Grammy-winning bluegrass singer Krauss.

Police said Evers drained Fulton’s life savings and got him to sign his $245,000 home over to her.

She pleaded guilty to theft by deception in January and was sentenced to eight years of probation, ordered to pay $73,000 in restitution, return four cars to the man and sign the man’s home back over to him, reports 4029TV.

In March, she then violated the terms of her probation by not returning the victim’s vehicles within 60 days of her guilty plea, according to court document.

An arrest warrant was issued for Evers in September after she missed a court date in Fayetteville.

Police in Albuquerque said they arrested Evers at a motel in October, where she was registered under a false name, and returned her to Arkansas.

Don Fulton, 75, says Evers convinced him that she was Alison Krauss by singing some of her country artist's greatest hits

Arrested: On Wednesday Evers appeared visibly upset and crying in court as she pleaded not guilty to a failure to appear charge. Her trial date is set for February 15

On Wednesday Evers appeared visibly upset and crying in court as she pleaded not guilty to a failure to appear charge. Her trial date is set for February 15.

Police say Evers told Fulton that she was the famous country star but that she was going by a different name because she was in the witness protection program, reports KRQE. 

Fulton says she convinced him that she was Alison Krauss by singing some of her hits.

Krauss, 43, is credited with raising interest in bluegrass through her fourteen albums and performances on movie soundtracks including O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Cold Mountain.

She has won 27 Grammy Awards from 41 nominations making her the most awarded singer and the most awarded female artist in Grammy history.

Her publicist, Regina Joskow, declined to comment on the case.
