A self-styled street preacher accused in a deadly plot to lure men with Craigslist job offers and then rob them was found guilty of aggravated murder on Tuesday and could face the death penalty.

A jury in Akron returned the verdict in the case against Richard Beasley, who was charged with killing two men from Ohio and one from Norfolk, Virginia. A man from South Carolina was shot but survived and testified about running for his life and hiding in the woods, scared he would bleed to death.

Family members of the victims hugged and wiped away tears as the verdict was read. Beasley, who also was convicted of attempted murder in wounding the lone survivor, slumped in his wheelchair, which he uses because of back problems.

Mugshot: Prosecutors said Beasley lured his first victim, Ralph Geiger, with the offer of a non-existent caretaker job at a rural Ohio ranch

Prosecutors, who had asked jurors to 
use common sense and return a guilty verdict, labeled the 53-year-old 
Beasley the triggerman in the 2011 plot with a high school student he 
mentored.

The 16-year-old student, Brogan Rafferty, was convicted and sentenced last year to life in prison without the chance of parole.

Prosecutor Jonathan Baumoel told 
jurors there was no reasonable doubt that Beasley plotted the killings, 
and he presented three possible theories for aggravated murder - 
planning the crimes, done with a kidnapping or done with a robbery. He 
said there was 'prior calculation and design,' a component of the death 
penalty aggravated murder charge.

'He was the mastermind behind this plot,' Baumoel said.

Prosecutors said the victims, all 
down on their luck and with few family ties that might highlight their 
disappearances, were lured with offers of farmhand jobs.

One man was killed near Akron, and the others were shot at a southeast Ohio farm during bogus job interviews.

The slain men were Ralph Geiger, 56, 
of Akron; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Virginia; and Timothy Kern, 47, 
of Massillon. Kern's body was found in a shallow grave near an 
Akron-area shopping mall.

The survivor, Scott Davis, testified 
that he heard the click of a gun as he walked in front of Beasley at the
reputed job site. Davis, who was shot in an arm, knocked the weapon 
aside.

'I spun around,' testified Davis, who
told a harrowing story of running through the woods and hiding for 
seven hours. 'I was worried about bleeding to death.'

On trial: During a prosecutor's opening statement, Richard Beasley was branded a 'false prophet' who took advantage of his victims by giving them 'a message of hope and change and a new start in life'

Prosecutors said it was a miracle 
that Davis, who also was the star witness at Rafferty's trial, survived 
the encounter with Beasley in Noble County, 60 miles east of Columbus.

'Only by the grace of God did he escape with his life,' Baumoel told the jury.

It was Davis' escape on Nov. 6, 2011,
that led authorities to find Pauley's body in the same area where Davis
was shot. Geiger's body also was found in Noble County.

Beasley, who returned to Ohio from 
Texas in 2004 after serving several years in prison on a burglary 
conviction, testified that he met with Davis and that Davis was the one 
who pulled a gun.

Convicted:
Brogan Rafferty has already been sentenced to life in prison without parole for his role in the murders. He is expected to testify against Beasley in his trial

'It misfired three times about 2 feet from my face, and I ran into the woods, and he ran after me,' Beasley said.

He testified that the two wrestled on the muddy ground and Davis ended up firing six shots.

'I said, `That's your six,' so if he was going to kill me, he was going to have to do it with his hands,' Beasley testified.

Beasley's lawyers had said that 
investigators targeted him based only on a hunch and that the identity 
theft and robbery motives prosecutors offered were baseless.

Beasley's testimony came after the 
prosecution rested its case without calling Rafferty, who had been 
subpoenaed to testify for the prosecution. There was no explanation why 
he didn't testify, and attorneys were under a gag order.

Rafferty, from Stow, was tried as an 
adult but didn't face a possible death penalty because he was a juvenile
when the crimes occurred.

Rafferty, now 18, had said the crimes 
were horrible but he didn't see any chance to stop the killings. He said
he feared Beasley would kill him and his relatives if he tipped off 
police.
