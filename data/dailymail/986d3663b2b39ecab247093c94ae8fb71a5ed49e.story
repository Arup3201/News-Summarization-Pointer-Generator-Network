Paul McCartney made history in August when he performed the final gig at San Francisco’s Candlestick Park - the same stadium The Beatles played 48 years previously.

And now an app has launched that lets fans experience the event as if they were there using Jaunt’s ‘cinematic virtual reality’ app.

When used with Google’s Cardboard VR headset, viewers are given an immersive, 360-degree view from in front of, and behind, the stage.

The Jaunt camera system simultaneously records 3D stereoscopic video in all directions, which is then coupled with 3D sound-field microphones.

The team then use so-called computational photography algorithms to process the recorded video, adjust the angles and colours, and make it appear more immersive.

It uses the VR head tracking to let users see in any direction, and hear the audio as if they were there.

Mr McCartney’s Live and Let Die concert, which took place at San Francisco’s Candlestick Park in August, was historic because it was the final event at the venue before it was closed.

It was 48 years, almost to the day, after The Beatles performed their final gig at the venue and is the first piece of content to be widely released by the virtual reality firm.

The footage is available as a free app from Google Play and works with Google’s Cardboard.

The gig will be available for Samsung’s Gear VR and the Oculus Rift ‘soon’. 

Google's Cardboard headset is made from corrugated cardboard folded to form an enclosure, in which a phone is then slotted in to act as a display.

When the headset is put on, lenses in the viewer show images from the screen as a left and right eye image.

The footage will be available to Samsung’s Gear VR and the Oculus Rift ‘soon’.

‘The concert at Candlestick put Sir Paul McCartney in front of 70,000 live fans, and with our technology and the launch of our app, we’re opening up this access to many more,’ said Jens Christensen, boss of Jaunt.

‘We’re creating a completely new medium for entertainment.

‘This is just the first step of our broader mission to bring viewers immersive access to the latest concerts, movies, sporting events and more through virtual reality.’
