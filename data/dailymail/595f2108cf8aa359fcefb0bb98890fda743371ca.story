The sister of honeymoon murder victim Anni Dewani has told of her regret at not telling her to call the wedding off.

Three weeks before Anni married Shrien Dewani, 34, she and her fiancé had an angry row in which she threw her engagement ring back at him, her sister Ami Denborg said.

Afterwards she called Mrs Denborg, who lives in Sweden, and told her the relationship was in trouble.

'She called me, I talked a lot to her that evening,' Mrs Denborg told Sky News.  'She was saying a lot of things - "It's not working well", and things like that.

Dewani, 34, of Bristol, previously claimed the couple was kidnapped at gunpoint as they travelled in a taxi

'I thought she was just stressed out. Looking back, I should have told her "OK fine, forget it, I'll support you, break this off". 

'Maybe she would have been alive today.'

Mrs Dewani, 28, was murdered during her South African honeymoon in November 2010 and businessman Dewani, 34, from Bristol, is to be tried in Cape Town next week for her murder.

The millionaire is accused of ordering her killing during their honeymoon in November 2010. His new bride was shot in the neck as the couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of the city.

Mrs Dewani's father, Vinod Hindocha, 65, said: 'I really hope we get to know what really happened. That's all we are asking for, tell us the truth. 

'No father should ever go through what we are going through.'

Her mother, Nilam Hindocha, 62, said: 'I was feeling something strange, so I told Vinod "You must ring Anni today".

Mr Hindocha said: 'She told me in Swedish - so I get the feeling she didn't want him to know what she was talking about.

Mrs Denborg and her and Anni's father, Vinod Hindocha, say they hope to discover the truth at Dewani's trial

His wife explained: 'She said "I have a lot to tell you, and I'll tell you when I'm back in Bristol".' 

Mrs Dewani's father described the last four years since his daughter's death as 'torture', saying: 'Why this happened, we still cannot understand.  I cannot digest this.  I cannot accept this.'

'There are so many fingers pointing at Shrien and he needs to answer those questions an he must answer those questions.

'For ourselves, for himself, tell us what really happened and why.' 

Mrs Hindocha added: 'It will be very difficult to hear but we have to be strong, we have to know the truth.

'Every day we remember her, at night we talk about her, we spend hours talking about her.

'She was full of life.  The house lit up when she came.' 

Shrien Dewani with Anni - he will go on trial on Monday accused of ordering the murder of his bride

Dewani faces charges of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, murder, kidnapping, and defeating the ends of justice.

He has previously claimed that the couple were kidnapped at gunpoint as they drove through Gugulethu township, and he was released unharmed but his wife's body was found in the abandoned car the next day.

Following a protracted legal battle over the severity of his mental health problems, Dewani, who was detained in a hospital in Britain for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, was extradited from Britain in April this year to face trial.

Three men have been convicted and jailed over Mrs Dewani's death, including taxi driver Zola Tongo, who was given 18 years after admitting his role in the killing.

Xolile Mngeni, whom prosecutors claim was the hitman, was convicted of premeditated murder over the shooting, and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, pleaded guilty to murder and was handed a 25-year prison sentence.
