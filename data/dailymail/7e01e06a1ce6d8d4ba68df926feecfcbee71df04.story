Nosebleeds are fairly common and caused when the tiny blood vessels inside the nose are disturbed. However, Mr Ford died hours after suffering one (posed by model)

It was only a simple nosebleed – but within hours, it had killed gardener Robert Ford.

Mr Ford, 47, was walking round the shops when his nose started to bleed, and promptly walked into a medical centre for help.

The bleeding soon stopped, and doctors just told him to go home and put ice on his nose.

Hours later, however, Mr Ford was found by his father, dead in his house. Spots of blood dotted his home – and more had blocked his airways. A pathologist said it was the only fatal nosebleed he had seen in 4,000 post mortems.

Mr Ford’s grieving father Michael said after an inquest into his death: ‘We’re not looking to blame anyone, we’re just mystified at our son’s death.

‘He was a much loved son, brother and uncle.’

The tragedy developed as Mr Ford was walking through the town centre of Gravesend in Kent with his friend John Churchill.

When his sudden nosebleed failed to 
stop, he went to the Gravesend Medical Centre, where doctors were 
clearly satisfied it was a routine problem which was likely to sort 
itself out.

But after he went home, the bleeding clearly started again – and he suddenly realised blood was beginning to clog his throat.

Mr Ford senior told an inquest in 
Gravesend, held on Wednesday, that he had phoned his son in June last 
year, only to be told by Richard to dial 999 because he was unable to 
breathe.

Mystery: Mr Ford visited the Gravesend Medical Centre, who told him to put ice on his nose

Mr Ford said: ‘We found him dead on 
the floor with a small pool of blood around his mouth. There were also 
10p-sized spots of blood around the house.

‘We rang the ambulance and paramedics
who tried to revive him. He was a very well-known character in 
Gravesend and it’s a big loss for his family and friends.’

Pathologist Olaf Biedrzycki told the 
inquest he had never seen a case like it in the 4,000 post-mortem 
examinations he had carried out.

Blood had entered Mr Ford’s airways, causing him to die, but Mr Biedrzycki could not explain where the blood came from.

He said: ‘This was certainly an odd 
case. We don’t really know how to explain it. I’ve looked very hard for a
source of the blood and could not find it.’

Mr Biedrzycki apologised to Mr Ford’s parents and brother who attended the hearing, a local paper reports.

He said: ‘It’s something of a mystery. I’m really sorry but I’m not entirely sure where this blood was coming from.’

Coroner Roger Hatch recorded a verdict of death by natural causes.

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Ford senior said: ‘We’re not looking to blame anyone, we’re just mystified at our son’s death.

‘He was a much loved son, brother and uncle.’
