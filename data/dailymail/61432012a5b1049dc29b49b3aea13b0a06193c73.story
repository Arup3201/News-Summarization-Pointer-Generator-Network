When Jennifer Lopez, 45, performed at the recent American Music Awards it was her performance - and not those of her younger contemporaries - that got everyone talking.

Despite the fact that Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez and Jessie J all took to the Nokia Theatre stage it was mother-of-two J-Lo whosent Twitter into a frenzy thanks to those abs, that bum and her super sexy dancing.

Even 24-year-old Iggy Azalea, who joined J-Lo on stage to perform their hit duet Booty, couldn't help but tweet her appreciation of Jennifer's famous figure.

'And of course [J-Lo] made me look like a pile of dog poo standing next to he because she's so perfect. seriously tho, i love her. babeville,' she said.

Is 2014 Jennifer Lopez's sexiest year yet? Performing at the American Music Awards over the weekend Jennifer Lopez wasn't shy about showing off her toned and tanned body

A quick costume change! J-Lo wore two outfits to perform at the event including this red sequinned jumpsuit and jacket combo

On the red carpet: Jen rocked a pink wrapped Reem Acra dress on the red carpet showing off her toned abs

And this isn't the first time Jen has caused a stir this year. 

From her controversial video for Booty which had saw both Jen and Iggy rolling around in vats of oil shaking their bottoms, to the silver Charbel Zoe gown she wore to the Video Music Awards in August which featured more cut out than actual dress, Jen's certainly been turning up the heat over the last 12 months. 

Because, lest we not forget, whilst she did set hearts racing in THAT split-to-the-waist green Versace dress in 2000, J-Lo's noughties wardrobe was actually more demure than daring. 

In fact there was a time when you were more likely to find her rocking a roll-neck on the red carpet than rolling around in her underwear.

Summer style: In July J-LO rocked the stage at the iHeartRadio Ultimate Pool Party in Miami Beach in a revealing costume

Forget your skirt? Jennifer showed off her famous 'ass-et' at the Fashion Rocks show in New York in September

There's even a song about it: Jen released Booty with fellow singer Iggy Azalea, all about women with big bums 

When she attended the premiere of An Unfinished Life in 2002 it was in a high-necked jumper and a fish tail skirt that left only her hands exposed. 

Two years later she showed up to a Marc Jacobs show in a simple shift dress that would be more at home in your mother's work wear wardrobe than on one of the the most famous bodies in the world. 

And whilst out with the former loves of her life, one-time fiance Ben Affleck and ex-husband and father of her children Mark Anthony, Jen always made sure to stay covered up. 

So what inspired Jen's super sexy make over? It seems her current urge to show off her incredibly body comes down to the fact that she's been working pretty hard to get it in shape.    

Remember this? In 2000 Jennifer caused a huge stir when she wore this daring Versace gown 

Back in the day: During the noughties Jen rocked a very different look, pictured here in 2002 (left) at a film premiere and 2004 at a Marc Jacobs fashion show she was then a fan of the high neckline

Jen liked to dress down for her men: At the Vanity Fair Oscar's party in 2003 with Ben Affleck she covered up (left) doing the same to watch American football with ex-husband Marc Anthony in 2009 (right)

Jen revealed in an interview earlier this year: ‘I've got an athletic body, I've worked out my whole life and I've been incredibly disciplined when I needed to be.’

‘I'm not one to overindulge. It doesn't make me feel good. Some people find it comforting to sit down and eat a whole pint of Häagen-Dazs, but honestly that would make me throw up. I don't think I've ever eaten that much.’

Although she does like to relax some times: ‘Mentally, I'm always thinking about it. I'm ok looking this way, but at the same time that ambitious, determined girl inside me is like, 'Come on, let's be in the best shape ever and really show everybody.' Then the other side of me thinks, 'Let's just relax on the beach chair.'   

Don't be fooled by the rocks that she's got! In 2007 Jen rocked a hippy chic look as she attended the launch of the Just Cavalli flagship store in New York 

Maternity style: Although as a mother Jennifer has been critisised for her racy performances and costumes when she was pregnant with her twins, Emme and Max, she was anything but

And although the mother faced criticism for her latest performance she has previously revealed that she doesn't feel her on stage outfits are any worse than others in the music industry.

'I don’t think I’m any racier than any other female pop artist, she said, 'Ok, I’ll wear a sexy outfit, but I think it’s more because my body shape’s a little different to other body shapes, so that’s not very fair.'

When she’s not on tour J-Lo trains with LA based fitness instructor Tracy Anderson. A favourite to the stars, Tracy is well known for having transformed the bodies of Gwyneth Paltrow, Madonna and Kim Kardashian.

Well that's one way to get everyone going: Jen set hearts racing in this sexy green beaded jumpsuit as she performed at the opening ceremony of the world cup in Brazil earlier this year

More cut out than dress: Jen rocked an amazing Charbel Zoe cut out gown to the Video Music Awards in Los Angeles in August

Tracy says that when she works with Jennifer their main focus is: ‘Keeping her sexy butt toned.’

Adding that they regularly switch up their work outs: ‘We change the workout every 10 workouts. That’s the secret. We can only stay on a movement every 10 days.

And Jen's no stranger to putting the hours in.  

‘She needs to get her exercise in one hour each day,’ she said, ‘30 minutes of cardio and 30 minutes of muscular structure.’ Tracy has also admitted that Jen never goes more than two days without working out such is her dedication to keeping her body in shape.

Anyone would think she'd like you to look at her bum: Jen wasn't afraid of showing off her bottom during her AMA's performance
