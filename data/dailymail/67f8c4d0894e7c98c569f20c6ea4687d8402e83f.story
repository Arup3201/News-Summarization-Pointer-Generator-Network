They might be fresh-faced and bright-eyed but when it comes to achieving their dancing dreams, girls will stop at nothing. And neither, it seems, will their mothers.

Now their antics are to appear on the small screen with the launch of a new reality series that follows a group of Liverpool mothers and their dancing daughters as they battle it out for West End glory.

But while the girls' rivalries are (generally) limited to the dancefloor, their mothers are a different story entirely.

From catfights ('It's like World War Three out there,' exclaims dance teacher Jennifer Ellison at one stage) to putting the kibosh on the competition, three 'dance mums' reveal why they'll stop at nothing in their battle to see their child succeed.

Ambitious: Dance mothers Kelly, Helen, Maxine, Serena, Danielle and Charlotte appear in a new reality show

SERENA MCCONVILLE, 37

Daughter: Chloe, eight

Ambition: West End stardom for her daughter 

Fight potential: Four - this is one laid back dance mum 

She works night shifts to pay for her daughter's dance lessons but that's just the start for Serena McConville.

'I will do whatever it takes to help Chloe achieve her dreams,' she says, steely determination glinting in her eyes. 'She puts so much in and gives up so much.'

McConville, who also has a son, Lewis, got her daughter's career off to an early start, when she enrolled her in a baby ballet class when she was just three years old.

'She loved putting her little tutu on and ballet shoes,' remembers her mother, fondly. 'She was always so excited every Saturday morning.

'Chloe loves to dance,' she adds. 'She never stops -  she dances at home, in school... She doesn't walk down the street, she dances down it.'

But while McConville has big ambitions for her daughter, she says the competitive world of dance mothers can sometimes be a bit too much.

'There is real competitiveness in the dance world,' she reveals. 'I do think competition is healthy and  it makes Chloe work harder to achieve her goals and get results but there are some mums out there that can take it to the extreme.

Not, she hastens to add, that she ever has. 'I would say the most outrageous thing I have ever done to boost Chloe's chances is to be a part of Dance Mums,' she chuckles.

'I've never done anything like this before. Being on television frightens the life out of me and it wasn't for Chloe's determination, I don't think I could have done it.'

Big plans: Serena McConville and daughter Chloe, eight, (left) and Danielle Simpson with daughter Aleah, nine

DANIELLE SIMPSON, 31

Daughter: Aleah, nine

Ambition: For Aleah to be 'the next Jennifer Ellison'

Fight potential: Nine - in part due to her friendship with the fiery Charlotte 

Tall, blonde and pretty, Danielle Simpson looks every inch the glamorous yummy mummy. But this mother-of-five has more on her mind than making cupcakes.

A former dance wannabe herself, Simpson admits that she lives vicariously through daughter Aleah, nine, and says her little star-in-the-making has the talent to make it to the top.

'I want to see Aleah be on stage and win trophies in the dance competitions,' she says. 'A career in the West End one day... that’s my biggest hope for my daughter.'

Like McConville, she readily admits to finding the dance world a competitive place and also says that there's little she wouldn't do for her daughter - even if that means getting involved in an argument with Aleah's dance teacher, former Brookside actress, Jennifer Ellison.

'We do go against Jennifer’s rules at times,' she confesses, before adding: 'Actually, it’s not the other mums that go against Jen’s rules, it’s me.

'It’s never the mums, they’re very good, lovely mums – it’s me. I don’t always agree with what Jennifer Ellison has to say to the kids. 

'Don’t get me wrong, she’s a brilliant teacher. I do love her too, she’s done everything for my daughter but there are times we don’t agree and there are times when we do agree.

'It’s definitely a love/hate relationship between us.'

Unsurprisingly, the antics of Simpson and best friend Charlotte Traynor make for excellent TV, with Ellison, in one scene, left squawking indignantly at what she sees as the pair's lack of respect.

'The disrespect that that they have is just unbelievable,' she fumes. 'Sam [Charlotte's daughter] is hysterically crying, while Charlotte is screaming at me like a docker.

'To be honest, I don't care if I see her ever again!'

Despite her best efforts to wind up Ellison, Simpson says everything she does is designed to give her daughter's career a boost. 

'I want her to become one of the best dancers in the world and go on the West End or to TV,' she says.

'I’m hoping that people will recognise her and that she will become well known. I don’t want to be on this show and then see it just slip away and no one knows who Aleah Simpson is.' 

Star pupil: Maxine Kelly is mother to Jennifer Ellison's star pupil, Tayluer Amos

MAXINE KELLY, 44

Daughter: Tayluer Amos,13

Ambition: For Tayluer to be happy

Fight potential: Six -as the mother of the show's best dancer, Maxine attracts a lot of jealous comments

Of all the mothers to appear on Dance Mums, Maxine Kelly is the gentlest and least controversial.

But when you're the mother of the star dancer, taking a more laissez faire approach to dancing is easy - as Kelly is all too well aware.

'My hopes for Tayleur is for her to lead a happy, healthy life and enjoy what she does best which is dancing,' she beams.

'Tayleur has done a lot of television work in the past: she’s been on Got To Dance, danced in front of the royal family, has been a special guest at the Royal Albert Hall and she’s star billed at the Empire.'

Tayleur, it seems, is one child who doesn't need any extra help from her mother, although that hasn't stopped Kelly from pulling off the odd stunt in a bid to boost her career.

'She represented England in Portugal this year and I jumped out of a plane to raise money to get her out there,' says Kelly.

'I’d do anything for Tayleur. Tayleur’s talents are definitely what she needs to get to the top and not her mum being a lunatic.

'I would do anything to help her out, but I don't want to embarrass her so that's where I'd draw the line.'

But while Kelly has no plans to embarrass her daughter, the other mothers are a different story and she admits to being worried about the hostile reception she and her talented daughter occasionally get.

'I get along with the other mums but them getting along with me... That's a different story. I wouldn’t connive against anybody,' she adds, 'and I would hate it if someone did it to me or Tayleur. 

She pauses and adds, 'I really hope no one will be nasty to Tayleur or myself.'
