She was 33 when she gave birth to her first child, and she assumed she would go on to have more.

But her successful career meant it never happened – and now actress Sherrie Hewson has admitted she is ‘haunted’ by the fact she never gave her daughter a sibling.

The former Coronation Street star even urged her only child Keeley, now 30, not to make the same mistake and to focus on starting a family earlier.

Miss Hewson, now 64 and a panellist on ITV’s Loose Women, confessed she is filled with regret by her decision to become a mother so late, knowing she has deprived her daughter of brothers and sisters to turn to. She said: ‘I just think it was selfish of me not to have thought about it. I should have planned my life better.

‘I do regret not having children earlier, but my biggest regret is not giving Keeley a sibling.

‘It will always haunt me because I think it was very unfair of me to not think about doing it.

‘She now doesn’t have a brother or sister. I just wish I could have given her that opportunity – to have someone she could ring – to turn to when she needed to.

‘To have that special relationship with a brother or sister – it’s a great sadness in my life.’

Born into a showbusiness family, Miss Hewson rose to fame in the 1970s, starring in Z Cars and episodes of the Carry On TV series, but it was her roles in soaps Emmerdale and Coronation Street – where she played Maureen Holdsworth – that turned her into a household name.

However, her demanding career meant the opportunity to settle down did not present itself until 1983, when she married businessman Ken Boyd.

Sadly, it was a toxic relationship, which saw Boyd humiliate Miss Hewson with his womanising and squander her hard-earned fortune, leaving her bankrupt. They finally divorced in 2010, nine years after she separated from him.

But her advice to her daughter stuck – with Keeley giving birth to a little boy aged just 22.

Miss Hewson, who has an elder brother, said: ‘I always said to her when she was young, ‘have your babies early – very early – have a boy and a girl and then stop.

‘If you want children, have them early so that you then grow up with them.’

And the actress believes that Keeley has done herself a great favour by having her children early, adding: ‘My daughter is only just 30, and she has an eight-year-old boy [Oliver] and a three-year old-girl [Molly] – she doesn’t need any more, and now she can start her career, without having to put a brake on it to have children.

‘She can get on with it and have a whole career of her own.

‘I made the mistake of waiting until I was 33 to have Keeley – but I hadn’t met anybody before then and I had a career that I didn’t know how to stop.'
