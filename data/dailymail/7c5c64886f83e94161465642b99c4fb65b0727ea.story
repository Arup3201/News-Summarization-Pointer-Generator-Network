Fox News is again under fire from because of their handling of Bradley Manning’s announcement that he’d prefer to be a she named Chelsea—this time for mocking Manning with a song.

With a photo of Chelsea beside one of Manning as Bradley, Fox and Friends played ‘Dude (Looks Like a Lady)’ by Aerosmith as they went to commercial Tuesday morning.

The jab at the convicted intelligence leaker comes just a few days after transgender allies bemoaned the network’s steadfast refusal last week to refer to Manning as ‘she.’

Low blow: Fox News is being criticized for playing the Aerosmith song Dude (Looks Like a Lady) specifically to mock Chelsea Manning

‘I don't do what Bradley Manning wants me to do,’ said host of Fox News’ American Newsroom host Gregg Jarrett on Friday.

Fox is not, however, the only major network to refuse to use the gender pronouns Manning prefers.

CNN reasons that they should continue referring to Manning as ‘he’ because the former soldier, who is now is at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas serving 35 years for leaking mountains of classified material to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, has not begun hormone therapy or changed ‘his’ gender through surgical means.

Manning has announced her intention to do so, however, which is what spurred the debate to begin with.

Refusal: Fox anchor Gregg Jarrett said he will not follow Manning's wishes to be referred to as a 'she'

‘As I transition into this next phase of my life,’ the 25-year-old said in a statement Thursday, ‘I want everyone to know the real me. I am Chelsea Manning. I am a female. Given the way that I feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible.’

Her attorney David Coombs told The Associated Press on Monday that Manning hoped the prison 'will simply do the right thing' over their request for hormone treatment so she won't have to sue.

Coombs said that the soldier had known for a long time she would make a statement about her identity, but 'she wanted, essentially, for the media surrounding the trial to dissipate.'

A media frenzy ensued, nonetheless, and much of the ado surrounded Manning’s choice of pronouns.

Two of the highest profile news organization’s in America—the Associated Press and the New York Times—quickly issued statements concerning the issue.

‘The Associated Press will henceforth use Pvt. Chelsea E. Manning and female pronouns for the soldier formerly known as Bradley Manning, in accordance with her wishes to live as a woman,’ came the AP’s official statement.

The AP’s stance, which applies to all transgender individuals, is the exact opposite of Fox News’.

‘People out there, don't send me angry emails that I refered to him as Bradley and not Chelsea and him instead of her,’ Jarrett said. ‘So thanks very much.’
