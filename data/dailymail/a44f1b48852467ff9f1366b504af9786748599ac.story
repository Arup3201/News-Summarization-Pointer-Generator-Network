A father has posted a photo on Gumtree of the remains of his 17-year-old son's smashed car to shame him into driving more carefully.

Steve Clark, from Monikie, Angus, advertised the wrecked 14-year-old Honda Civic 1.4 for sale for one penny - adding a picture of the vehicle on its roof.

He said he wanted to 'embarrass' his son and to make other parents aware of their children's driving habits.

Nathanial Clark, 17, rolled the 1.4 litre motor on a bend near his home. Luckily he walked away from the wreck with no physical injuries

He wrote on the ad: 'Due to son thinking he's Colin McRae, I now have a 2000 Honda Civic 1.4 breaking for spares.

'It seems a 1.4 was to much for him to handle. He talked the talk, but certainly didn't walk the walk - he will be walking now, for a long time.

'If only all roads were straight, we as parents wouldn't have to worry about our over-enthusiastic sons.

'It seems his ambition outweighed his talent on this occasion. I can't think why! he's been driving for over a week now...

'One FOC (free of charge) 17-year-old boy, complete with black eye - not from accident, administered by myself!'

Mr Clark,  55, a former administration manager of a skip hire company, said today that he feared that if his son, Nathaniel, continued to drive so badly, 'he won't see 18'.

Nathaniel, an apprentice with commercial vehicle dealers AM Phillip in Forfar, was driving home from work only nine days after passing his driving test   when he lost control taking a corner too fast.

Mr Clark said he had hoped that his son would be more careful on the road after previously warning him of the dangers of driving, and also due to his   experience with off-road motorcycles.

He said: 'His mother took the initial phone call when we found out he had been in a car accident.

'She was devastated. She handed the telephone to me shaking and crying, saying that he was on his roof.

The father has received floods of messages of support from other parents of young drivers for his actions.

'I knew straight away who and what she was talking about.'

He added: He wasn't hurt, which is a Godsend. Obviously our first concern was for his health as the car can be replaced, probably at a later date.'

Mr Clark said he liked 'to do things outside of the box' and felt that posting the advert online was the best way to shame his son.

He said he and his wife Lorraine have received floods of messages of support from other parents of young drivers for his actions.

'The support I have had from other parents and drivers has been overwhelming,' he said.

'It was mainly just to shock people and let people know what happens out there when their kids go for a drive; how hard it is for us parents to sit at   home waiting on a dreaded phone call or wondering if they're going to come home in one piece.'

Nathanial's brother, Nicholas, 27, showed Nathanial the advert five hours after it was posted. Mr Clark described his son as 'shocked' and 'mortified'.

He added: 'I can't believe that a daft wee advert has attracted so much attention.'  Nathanial passed his test on the 1st of May 2014 and his mother and father paid for the car.

The crash took place on the Bonnyton Road between Forfar and Monikie on Satuday May 10 at 12.30pm.

Mr Clark said that since the advert was posted on Monday, he had received many informal   offers including someone offering a packet of biscuits for the remains of the vehicle.

He has also had two formal offers, one of £250 and another of £370 for the remains.
