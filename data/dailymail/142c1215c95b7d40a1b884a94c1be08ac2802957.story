Team news

QPR

QPR midfielder Joey Barton could return for Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Crystal Palace at Loftus Road.

Barton missed the 2-1 defeat at Arsenal with a hamstring problem but may feature, while midfielder Leroy Fer will start after QPR opted to rest him against the Gunners due to being on four yellow cards.

Long-term injury casualties Sandro and Alejandro Faurlin (both knee) are definitely out.

Provisional squad: Green, McCarthy, Murphy, Traore, Onuoha, Ferdinand, Dunne, Caulker, Hill, Henry, Barton, Fer, Mutch, Phillips, Kranjcar, Hoilett, Austin, Zamora.

Crystal Palace

Crystal Palace could be without Yannick Bolasie for the trip to QPR as the winger's wife is due to give birth.

The 25-year-old's partner is overdue and Neil Warnock, who was sacked as manager on Saturday, explained he was brought off against Southampton to save his legs for the Loftus Road encounter as he was already tired.
