Those who claim Britain's Got Talent and The X Factor humiliate their contestants will be foaming at the mouth when they hear about ITV's latest prime-time Saturday night extravaganza. 

When international illusionist Keith Barry introduces an extraordinary new Generation Game-type TV show tonight, viewers will see what happens when the contestants who are competing to win pots of money are given bizarre instructions under hypnosis. 

They end up doing the most mind-bogglingly embarrassing things – to the extent that while your toes do curl for them, you have to remind yourself that they have willingly volunteered to make fools of themselves.

Hypnotist Keith Barry with five contestants on ITV's new show You're Back In The Room

Hosted by Phillip Schofield, ITV's You're Back In The Room pits five hypnotised strangers against each other as they take on apparently simple game-show challenges straight out of Bruce Forsyth's 70s heyday, such as making balloon animals and doing impersonations of pop stars. 

The twist that brings it into the 21st century Hunger Games-style arena is when Keith – who's already hypnotised them – then sabotages their chances of winning by telling them to do the weirdest things.

So for example, when a clutch of five contestants is asked to make sculptures out of clay, one is made to believe that the clay is a miracle face cream, while another is certain it smells of dog dirt. 

A third is convinced she really is a mad French sculptor, a fourth that everyone else's sculptures are obscene and the final one, when triggered by hearing that famous Unchained Melody song, believes he's Patrick Swayze in the amorous pottery scene from the film Ghost.

Of course the question of how safe it is to play with the volunteering contestants' minds like this, and just how humiliating the results are once all inhibitions are removed, is going to make this one of the most controversial shows ever.

Keith, an Irish hypnotist and magician who has appeared on stage and TV all over the world and also uses his technique to help people overcome phobias and shyness, admits even he wasn't quite sure what would happen.

'They were like greyhounds coming out onto the track, ready to accept any suggestion I gave them,' he says. 'But I was a bit worried they might run amok because while Phillip is on stage at all times, I'm not. So even though the contestants couldn't see me I still felt I had a duty of responsibility to keep control over their behaviour.

'Hypnosis is about shutting down the conscious mind and re-igniting the unconscious and the imagination, so while I give instructions to them under hypnosis the contestants might interpret those instructions in all kinds of ways. For example, 60-year-old contestant Carolyn was a polite and gentle soul off-camera, but after hypnosis I could get her to do anything. When she was told to be a frustrated French sculptor, she got very, very angry. Phillip was shocked!

'Another contestant was asked to throw a pizza off stage. Her imagination went wild and she threw it over a member of the audience who happened to be beautifully dressed for her birthday celebrations. That proves just how spontaneous the show is.'

Every week members of the studio audience who've come to see the show being filmed are invited to take part in a few tests before the show begins to see which of them are more susceptible to hypnosis – and so who is likely to make a fool of themselves and get the biggest laughs. Then five are picked to compete in the challenges onstage. 

'Anyone can be put into a trance but everyone has different levels of susceptibility,' explains Keith. 'One studio audience test I did where I got people to imagine their hands are glued together was classic. Many of them, even the cynical ones, found they couldn't pull their hands apart.

'Once we've picked our five candidates I take them backstage and put them into a deep trance, which takes about 20 minutes. First I make sure they shut down their physical bodies by getting them to sit comfortably, focus on their breathing and relax. Then I get them to imagine they're at the top of the stairs and to count down, imagining their own choice of colour for the stairs and how many there are as they're walking down, so that by the time they reach the bottom they've drifted into a calm hypnotic state. From there I'm able to implant suggestions into their minds.'

Keith then brings the contestants round before they emerge onto the stage. But they're still in a waking trance, and although they're speaking and acting normally in this state, Keith only has to say the word 'sleep' and they instantly nod off. At this point he can implant instructions into their minds which will get them to behave totally out of character – and hinder their progress during each round of games. 'Once you've hypnotised someone once, you can pretty much put them under instantly any time you meet them afterwards,' says Keith.

The instructions he gives them can have astonishing effects. One episode involves the contestants serving a champagne dinner to four popular TV chefs – Ed Baines, Aldo Zilli, Paul Rankin and Lesley Waters – in a supposedly 'posh' restaurant. But once Keith suggests ideas into their minds, it quickly turns into more of a dog's dinner. One woman is told she's lost her expensive ring in the mashed potato, while another participant is convinced the guests are toddlers who need encouragement to eat their food and the girl serving the gravy thinks she's aboard a ship in rough seas.

Because detailed portrayal of the way Keith manages to put the contestants into a state of deep trance is banned under stage hypnosis laws, it naturally begs the question of whether the participants are acting, or at least playing to the gallery. 

Keith insists it's all bona fide. 'Phillip was sceptical at the outset but he soon realised how real hypnosis is and how it allows people to do things they wouldn't normally do. After each show he tells the studio audience that he would never have become involved unless he was 100 per cent convinced that everything I do is real. But putting someone into a deep trance can't be shown on TV for legal reasons in case someone does it at home and they don't have me there to wake them up afterwards.'

David Behan, a Harley Street hypnotherapist who treats a range of issues from weight loss to giving up smoking, says, 'People have been using hypnosis to cure themselves and others since ancient Egyptian times. Paul McKenna brought the positive aspects of hypnosis to the forefront with his TV shows in the 1990s. He showed people how they could utilise hypnosis to help themselves become more confident and conquer anxiety, bed-wetting, losing weight and giving up smoking. 

But the onus is on the therapist to use this technique in accordance with a moral code. Does this show do that? That's not for me to say, it will be up to the viewer to decide. Lots of people have never seen hypnosis being carried out and may want to investigate more. I know of Keith Barry but have never met him, but he's morally bound to make sure no harm comes to anyone taking part.

'Hypnosis should be used to help people and not used to encourage others to laugh at them. No one can be forced in their behaviour, under hypnosis they are simply following a suggestion. It's a heightened state of awareness. Perception at its most open.' Whether the show will put off people who might have considered hypnotherapy to help themselves we can never know.

Keith says at the end of each show his final task is to 'de-fry', as he calls it, the five contestants and bring them back to normal consciousness. 'I remove all the game show suggestions I've implanted in their minds and replace them with confident thoughts so they can look to their futures in a positive way,' he insists.

Then he shows them the footage of what they got up to – and if you want proof of the authenticity of what goes on, married mother Kate Cook offers it. 'I'm a bubbly person but there's no way I would normally have been able to do what I did under hypnosis,' says Kate, 30. 'I was told to fall in love with Phillip Schofield. I believed I was utterly in love with him and I believed he loved me too. I was waiting for him to propose to me any moment. It was surreal. Meanwhile my husband Chris was in the audience and a man next to him, said, 'Good grief, can you imagine what her boyfriend will say?' Chris said, 'That's my wife!'

We know we live in an age when people crave to be famous – or even infamous. Kate, like all the other contestants I spoke to afterwards, said how much she enjoyed the whole experience. 

Ross Calder, a 33-year-old musician who'd been told he was naked on stage, told me, 'I truly believed I was naked even though I could see I was actually wearing clothes. But after the show I felt energised – as if I could accomplish anything.'

Those who believe in self-control will watch with their hands over their eyes but Phillip Schofield, who is no doubt hoping it will get similar sort of ratings to BGT, is convinced it will be a hit. 'It's absolutely hysterical. I had no idea what to expect, but the contestants completely lose their inhibitions under hypnosis. I think one of the highlights was Kate professing her love for me – you really have to see it to believe it.'
