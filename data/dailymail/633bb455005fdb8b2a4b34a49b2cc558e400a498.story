Lee Ellis, 39, stole roof tiles and lead flashing from the home of his former partner and two children

A father-of-two who literally stole the roof over his children's heads by stealing tiles and lead from their house has walked free from court.

Unemployed Lee Ellis, 39, climbed up on to the roof of former partner Jill Slater's house in Castleford, West Yorkshire, in the early hours of the morning and removed the tiles and lead flashing.

Ms Slater was was asleep at the property with their three-year-old twins and her 15-year-old daughter from a previous relationship when she awoke to footsteps on the roof. 

She rang police and then looked out the window - coming face to face with her former partner as he climbed down from the roof.

Ellis fled the scene on foot but was caught by police officers after a brief chase following the theft on June 18.

Wakefield Magistrates Court heard the tiles had been stacked up on the roof and a large quantity of lead flashing was found on the ground outside the house.

Lisa Evans, prosecuting, told the court Miss Slater had to claim £3,500 from her insurance company for the damage Ellis caused to her home.

She said: 'It sounded like rubble falling down and then footsteps. She was afraid and went in to her older daughter's room, who was also afraid.'

Mitigating at the hearing yesterday, Craig Sutcliffe said his client had taken sleeping tablets and had little recollection of the incident.

He said: 'He had no intention to cause upset to his own children or the mother of his children. The break up with Miss Slater was difficult for Mr Ellis.

'It wasn't a situation where there was a clean break between them, that's inevitable when there are children in the family.

'Also, despite the fact that they split up some time ago, they have periodically got back together which has perhaps led to a state of confusion about whether the relationship was truly over.

'This was the final realisation that it was over. Whilst this was unpleasant for Miss Slater, at least it was someone who was familiar to her.

'There is no suggestion of the defendant using or threatening any violence towards her that night.

'He accepts that having removed them the most likely thing he would have done is sold them. He can only put it down to the sleeping tablets.'

Ellis, of Castleford, admitted theft when he appeared at a previous hearing earlier this month.

Bench chairman James Rollings-Spink sentenced Ellis to a 12-month community order with a 30-day activity requirement plus supervision for 12 months.

Mr Rollings-Spink told Ellis that he must pay Miss Slater £150 compensation plus £85 towards prosecution costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

He was also handed a 12 month restraining order, which bans him from contacting Miss Slater directly or indirectly. Ellis was told that he can only contact Miss Slater via a third party regarding their children.
