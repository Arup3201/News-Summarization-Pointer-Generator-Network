The shocking mugshots of the Mississippi parents who fled to Georgia with their young daughter after their infant was found dead shed light on the couple's shocking decline.

Police captured Donald Boyd Harris, 34, and Allison Studdard, 31, early Thursday in Sylvester, Ga., about 170 miles south of Atlanta. The couple's two-year-old daughter was unharmed during their time on the lam.

Harris and Studdard are being held on felony drug warrants, and deputies are heading Friday to Georgia to bring them back to Mississippi. It is not clear if they will face additional charges.

The newly-released pictures show the transformation from what was a clean-cut, all-American couple to a strung-out, frazzled life on the run from police.

'It's too early in the investigation to say,' a police spokesperson told WXIA. 'That will be part of the investigation process.'

A search of the home found crystal meth, the spokesperson added.

Mississippi authorities say it could be 
weeks before they know what caused the death of 7-month-old Alyssa 
Harris.

Lowndes County (Mississippi) Coroner Greg Merchant said an autopsy was completed Wednesday but it did not reveal a cause of death, and also that it would be weeks before toxicology results would be available. Her body is being held in the morgue until her parents are able to discuss funeral plans.

Authorities have yet to file charges in the bay's death.

The apparently drug addicted couple was living with their children at the home of Studdard's father about a mile from the Alabama state line, authorities said.

Roger Studdard told police he was woken by noises made while the couple frantically tried to revive their unresponsive baby.

They fled when he called 911, cops said.

It is not clear what caused the baby's death, but violence is not suspected.

'It doesn't look like there are apparent injuries,' another official told the station.

Deputies arrived to find the lifeless infant in it's bassinet, and also found the drugs in the home.

Authorities do not believe the home was a meth lab, but do suspect the illicit substances were being consumed on the property.

'It was a fairly clean home,' a police spokesperson said. 'It is a nice single-family dwelling.'

The pair was mostly unemployed, with Harris finding some work repairing cell phones inside the home, said police. Studdard is said to have assisted him.

The spokesperson said he was not aware of any prior incidents requiring a police presence at the home.

Previous pictures of the couple found on Facebook showed no indication of their current state of affairs.

'We're still working on trying to pull records,' he added. 'We never really had any contact with them, up until yesterday.'

Mississippi issued an Amber Alert on Wednesday for the couple's 2-year-old daughter, Maliah Harris, after Donald Harris and Studdard fled with her.

She was with them and unharmed when they were captured. A police officer told WALB he sang to the confused, distraught young girl to try to calm her down.

'The only thing I could think of was to sing songs I sing to my little girl and try to calm her down,' said Sylvester Police Department officer Paul Klein.

Police said they also found more drugs in the couple's car.

'The female suspect, she really didn't say too much. She broke down and started crying. The male suspect, Donald, he knew what it was in reference to,' Klein added.

Authorities released Maliah to the Georgia Department of Family and Children Services.

The couple reportedly has ties to the state in the form of expired driver's licenses and a Georgia plates on the car they were driving.

They were spotted by locals who notified local officials.

It is not clear if more charges will be filed in the case.
