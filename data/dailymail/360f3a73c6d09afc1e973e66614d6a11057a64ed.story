More than £25billion has been wiped off the FTSE 100 today as Spain moved closer to asking for a £238billion bailout.

The index of the UK's most capitalised companies shed nearly 2 per cent of its value, and as the market drew to a close, it was trading down 107.4 points at 5,752.29.

The market sell-off was triggered in the main by uncertainty over Spain's economic future and whether it will accept the terms of a £238billion eurozone bailout.

Markets across Europe reacted following anti-austerity protests
in both Athens and Madrid.

The violent demonstrations in Spain and growing talk of secession in Catalonia have piled the pressure on Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as he moves 
closer to asking Europe for rescue money.

In public, Mr Rajoy has been resisting calls from bankers at home and the 
leaders of France and Italy to move quickly to request assistance, but 
behind the scenes he is working hard to meet stringent conditions for aid.

Tomorrow Rajoy 
will present tough economic reforms and a money-saving 2013 budget aimed at persuading euro zone partners and investors that Spain is doing 
its deficit-cutting homework despite a recession and 25 per cent 
unemployment.

Figures released yesterday suggested Spain will miss its public deficit
target of 6.3 percent of gross domestic product this year, and today the central bank said the economy continued to contract 
sharply in the third quarter.

On Friday, Moody's will publish its latest review of Spain's credit 
rating, possibly downgrading the country's debt to junk status.

On the same day, an independent audit of Spain's banks will reveal how 
much money Madrid will need from a £79billion  aid 
package that Europe has already approved for the banks.

There are also media reports that the IMF is reluctant to lend more to Athens without a new debt restructuring plan, and that Russia is getting cold feet about offering Cyprus a much-needed loan.

Suki Mann, head of credit strategy at Societe Generale, said political rhetoric from all sides - Germans, IMF, Spanish politicians and the Catalans - was being ramped up ahead of the Spanish budget tomorrow and banking sector recapitalisation report on Friday.

He said: 'But it's not all over unless the eurozone/currency falls apart. It's pulling hard against the seams right now.

'The bumbling political response at the eurozone level is something we have become accustomed to, but domestic political risk and escalating internal strife is another ball game.'

Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: 'Reality has bitten back hard today as markets have once again woken up to the political and economic realities of the policies being pursued in Europe.

'Austerity protests in Spain last 
night have been followed by further protests and a general strike in 
Greece as populations tire of bearing the burden of spending cuts and 
tax rises against a backdrop of record unemployment and stagnant 
economies.

'Images of tear 
gas and rioting protesters on TV screens don't generally engender 
confidence in investors that EU leaders have control of the situation in
Europe.'

Prime Minister Rajoy today suggested in an interview that he would make 
the move to ask for the bailout if debt financing costs remained too high for too long.

'I can assure you 100 percent that I would ask for this bailout,' he 
told the Wall Street Journal, calling the situation he faces right now 
'fascinating'.

He also said he had not made his mind up on whether to maintain 
inflation indexation of pensions, which could cost the state an extra 6 
billion euros this year.

'We need to be sufficiently flexible in order not to create any further problems,' he said when asked about pensions.

The interview, the central bank's warning on the third quarter and other
factors drove up Spain's borrowing costs, with the yield on the 
benchmark ten-year bond jumping to 6 percent a level seen 
as unsustainable in the medium term.

Markets also reacted to a letter from Germany, Finland and the 
Netherlands on Tuesday that implied that rescue funds Spain receives for
its banks will remain on its public debt. The three said any future 
direct recapitalisation of banks by the euro zone's bailout fund should 
not cover 'legacy' problems.

The drop in the FTSE index was a two-week low, with banks and mines hit hardest.

HSBC Securities equity strategist Robert Parkes said: 'There is a lot of uncertainty at the moment on the macro(economic) side and a lack of visibility regarding growth in Europe, the U.S. fiscal cliff and a slowdown in China.

'It is dangerous to have an extreme position in either direction. But we still like sectors such as banks, energy and utilities.

'The energy sector offers good value, has a fair degree of earnings visibility and it is not as much exposed to the global business cycle as some other sectors. Utilities have been an unloved sector for some time, but offer a lot of value.'

Some defensive shares performed better, with British American Tobacco up 0.4 percent and Imperial Tobacco down just 0.3 percent.
