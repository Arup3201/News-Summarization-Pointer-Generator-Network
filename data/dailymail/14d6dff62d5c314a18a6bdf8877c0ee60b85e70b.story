Paul Johnson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says Labour's plans to soften spending cuts would add £170billion to the national debt by 2030

Labour's pledge to soften spending cuts in power would mean borrowing up to £50billion a year more by 2020 than the Tories, a respected think-tank said last night.

Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, claimed Ed Miliband's plans would add £170billion to the national debt by 2030.

This would mean greater risks for the economy and make it much harder for the UK to withstand economic shocks in future years, he wrote in The Times.

The IFS also said families with children have been among the biggest losers since the Coalition came to power. 

It found while pensioners have been protected by tax and benefit changes since 2010, families with children 'have lost more on average than other household types'.

The report questions David Cameron's promise to lead the most family-friendly government ever – and will cause alarm among Tory MPs ahead of May's poll.

'The overall effect of tax and benefit changes implemented since January 2010 has been to hit the richest hardest, to take benefits away from the poorer half of the income distribution, and largely protect those on middle and upper middle incomes,' said Mr Johnson.

'Pensioners have also largely been protected while families with children have lost out.

'Lest there be any doubt, there is a big difference between £7 billion of cuts and £33 billion of cuts.

'If you take the plans set out in the autumn statement at face value, spending cuts of more than £50 billion could be required after 2015/16.'

He added: 'The problem is that another recession will strike one day. Going into a new recession with debt still high - and it is higher now than at any time since the late 1960s - could leave less room for manoeuvre.

'The sort of additional borrowing that we are able to support as we made our way through the recent period might not be as easily financed.'

Conservative plans will prove tough to deliver, Mr Johnson suggested.

He wrote: 'Under the autumn statement plans, Conservatives could be cutting unprotected budgets by 26% after 2015/16 or an extraordinary 41% over the period from 2010.

Mr Johnson said Ed Miliband's, left, plan to soften spending cuts would mean borrowing up to £50billion a year more by 2020 than the Tories. He also questioned David Cameron's, right, promise to lead the most family-friendly government ever

'Even just to meet their more modest fiscal target, these budgets would need to be cut by more than 15% after 2015/16.

'Labour would need to implement cuts of just 3%.'

He pointed out that Conservatives would want to achieve a surplus on the overall budget and do not want to borrow to invest.

'That means they would need to find spending cuts of around £33 billion after 2015/16,' he added.

Changes made by the Coalition mean families where one parent is earning more than £50,000 a year are no longer able to claim the £20.50 a week for an eldest or only child and £13.55 a week for subsequent children.

Mr Johnson said understanding the economic facts 'should be crucial to the choices people make' on polling day.

Downing Street won some backing for its claim that the deficit had halved under the Coalition – but it was told it was still far bigger than planned.

The IFS said annual borrowing is on course to fall from 10.2 per cent of national income in 2009-10 to 5 per cent this year – £90billion against a planned £45billion.
