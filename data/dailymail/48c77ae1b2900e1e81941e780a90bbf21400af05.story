The shocking moment a driver was forced off the road when he was cut off by a lorry has been captured in a terrifying dash-cam video.

Jim McLaughlin was driving his van to work when a huge articulated truck pulled into the road ahead of him, apparently without checking for oncoming traffic.

He immediately took evasive action and swerved his vehicle onto the grassy verge, coming to a stop as the lorry continued down the road without stopping to check Mr McLaughlin was unhurt.

Danger: Jim McLaughlin captured video of himself being forced to take evasive action when a lorry, pictured here approaching from the right, pulled out in front of him

Sudden: The lorry pulled out onto the road in the Scottish Highlights and cut Mr McLaughlin off

Video captured by a camera mounted on the van's dashboard shows that the lorry driver would have had a clear view of the road before pulling out.

Mr McLaughlin, who was travelling from his home in Inverness to his fruit and veg business in the Highland town of Tain, has now posted the video on YouTube in a bid to shame the driver.

'I was just driving along listening to music on my way to work and I saw the guy coming from the right side, but I assumed he would come to a stop,' the 52-year-old said.

'But then I just saw the truck come right across and nearly crash into me. I thought I was dust. Everything seemed to happen very fast and incidents like this have happened at this junction in the past.

Shock: The lorry was going at a high speed and did not appear to see Mr McLaughlin's van

Emergency: The van driver swerved out of the way of the lorry, dislodging snow from the roof of his vehicle

'After the incident I drove after him and he stopped in a lay-by three or four miles on where I explained to him that he nearly killed me and after that he apologised.

'I ride a motorbike too and people do it all the time because they're harder to see, but I don't know how you can miss a van.

'The whole point of putting the video online is because people have been trying to get something done about that junction.

'I have seen so many close shaves there myself and you draw your teeth in, but I think this one was the closest. It is happening every week and someone will eventually get killed.'

Visibility: Mr McLaughlin's windscreen was hard to see through as he swerved onto a grassy verge

Blind; The lorry ignored the near-miss accident and simply carried on down the road

Local councillor Maxine Smith said: 'I have seen the video and it is just terrible. The thing is, there are near misses at this junction all the time.

'I get emails weekly about this and fortunately this driver saw it coming and took evasive action, which was lucky because there was a lorry coming up behind as well.

'I think with evidence like this it is crucial that people send in their accounts of things like this happening.'

A spokesman for Police Scotland confirmed they were aware of the incident.

G A McKenzie, the company which owns the lorry, refused to comment on the video.
