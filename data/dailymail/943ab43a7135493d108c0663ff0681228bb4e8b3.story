Representative sample? Reporter Jordan Jarrett-Bryan contacted staff from his former workplace to talk about how police are perceived in Brixton

Channel 4 yesterday admitted misleading viewers with a report on policing in which the interviewees worked for the same company.

In the wake of last week’s allegations of corruption and cover-up in the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry, the broadcaster commissioned a ‘vox pop’ to gauge views on the police in London.

However, instead of finding a representative sample of opinion, the reporter contacted staff from the office he had worked in before joining Channel 4.

The report has provoked fury from residents in Brixton, south London, who said it suggested everyone in the area distrusted the police.

Tory MP Rob Wilson condemned the broadcaster, saying: ‘This is very disappointing from Channel 4 News. A distorted report could have been very unhelpful, indeed inflammatory, and I hope the people concerned have learnt an important lesson.’

The feature was screened last Thursday with the strap line: ‘Our reporter, Jordan Jarrett-Bryan, spent the day in Brixton, south London, to test out what residents there felt about the police.’

Mr Jarrett-Bryan interviewed controversial race equalities adviser Lee Jasper and five staff at the marketing agency Livity, which describes its work as youth engagement and lists Channel 4 among its clients.

Only one of them, youth development mentor Naomi Brown, was credited on screen as an employee, leaving viewers to assume the others were a representative sample of residents. Their reflections on the police were overwhelmingly negative.

Mr Jarrett-Bryan concluded: ‘I found little hope of change here but a community still fighting for parity.’

A resident established that the interviewees were all linked and posted his findings on a popular local website, Brixton Buzz, which broke the story.

The storm forced the broadcaster to remove the report from its website. A spokesman said: ‘This was a quick turnaround project, the journalist interviewed people who live, work or were born in Brixton – who also worked for Livity.

They all expressed their own individual views. We accept we should have been clear that they all worked at the same place, we should have made further enquiries and we regret this oversight.’

Writing on online message boards, viewers condemned Channel 4 for broadcasting the misleading report.

One said: ‘I’m a journalist but would never dream of pulling such a stunt. It’s mind-blowingly unethical. Channel 4 should at least acknowledge that something went badly wrong. Pulling the video and stuff is not a good look for any news organisation.’

Another added: ‘It’s difficult enough to find any accurate and non-superficial reporting on Brixton, and this sort of nonsense doesn’t help.’

Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom said it had received one complaint yesterday and is considering whether to launch an investigation.
