Bolton are considering offering Eidur Gudjohnsen a contract. The 36-year-old has trained at the club since leaving Club Brugge.

Gudjohnsen took part in a first team training session with his former side last Monday and may have done enough to have earned a contract.

The Icelandic striker signed for Chelsea from the Lancashire side 14 years ago after playing at the Reebok Stadium between 1998 and 2000.

Gudjohnsen, who  is now a free agent, has been training with the Championship side to maintain fitness but it now seems the frontman may have done enough to earn a permanent switch.

The 36-year-old scored 26 goals in his two seasons at Bolton, before six fruitful years at Stamford Bridge.

He then went to Barcelona, winning the Champions League in 2009, before going on a journey via Monaco, Tottenham, Stoke, Fulham, AEK Athens and Cercle Brugge.

Neil Lennon's Bolton are currently on a mini-revival in 21st place having won four of their last six games.
