More than three dozen people who were brought into a Washington state jail on misdemeanor charges have come forward claiming inappropriate conduct and invasion of privacy after they were allegedly forced to strip naked on camera.

The total number of complaints have tripled since 11 women and one man filed a lawsuit against Puyallup city jail in August, claiming cameras in their holding cells recorded their most intimate moments as they changed into jail uniforms or used the bathroom.

'You're basically treated like an animal, like a piece of meat,' one victim told King5.

'And these people are supposed to be upholding the law.'

Almost all complainants were being held on suspected DUI offenses, for which they are typically released in a matter of hours.

'Sick': More than three dozen people being held in Puyallup city jail in Washington State on DUI charges have complained about their treatment at the facility after discovering intimate moments, such as going to the bathroom, were being recorded by CCTV cameras

Vulnerable: One woman claims that, after changing into a jail uniform, she was ordered back into her cell and told to take off her underwear, which was being filmed on camera

Indecent: Some of the videos, which were obtained by public record requests, show the women undressing

One female complainant said that, after changing into a jail uniform, a jailer asked her to go back into her cell and remove her underwear.

'What possible security reason could they have ... she's going to hand herself with her panties?' said Seattle attorney James Egan, whose law firm is handling the case.

'She's about to be released and out the door.'

Egan has obtained several surveillance tapes from Puyallup city jail through public record requests, which were released to King5.

He said the women were unaware their actions were being recorded on a monitor that was watched by mostly mail jailers.

Scene: The jail at the center of the action is inside this Puyallup Police building in Washington state

Leading the case: Seattle attorney James Egan first filed a lawsuit on behalf of 11 women and one man in August. He has since been contacted by more than two dozen other people with similar stories

Attorney's acting on behalf of Puyallup city jail say the camera operations inside the facility are standard practive

One woman from Kings County, who chose not to be identified, was arrested for suspected drunk driving in April and said she refused to change her clothes until a female officer was present because she was comfortable with the four male guards nearby.

'Basically I was harassed for not doing it and put back in the holding cell and made to stay there for about 12 hours,' the woman said.

Another woman said there was no reason for her to strip naked.

'I thought maybe it was for seeing if we have contraband of something, but we are already patted down,' she said.

'So then why would there be a camera still?'

'I just didn't feel comfortable with the situation so I wasn't going to do it': This woman, who asked not to be identified, refused to undress on camera after being arrested on suspected drunk driving

Jail experts say such levels surveillance were extremely unusual.

Kenneth Burns, an architect who has designed 40 jails, said he was 'stunned' by the recently released videos.

'We do have lots of cameras but (usually) you cannot watch anywhere where someone is using the shower, toilet facilities or a changing area,' Burns told King5.

However Puyallup City attorney Kevin Yamamota, speaking on behalf of the jail, said placing cameras in common areas and cells was standard practice and that there are no plans to change such methods.

'The jail videos we've watched so far don't show any inappropriate activity,' Yamamota said.

Payallup City attorney Kevin Yamamota maintained jail officers had acted 'very professionally'

'In fact the corrections officers are acting very professionally.'

A female victim was quick to disagree after seeing herself in the videos.

'It's so sick,' she said.

'Oh my god, I (didn't) believe my own eye.

'I feel sick to my stomach.'

The case continues.
