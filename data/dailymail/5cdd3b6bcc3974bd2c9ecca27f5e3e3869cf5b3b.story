Fears that Ebola is spreading in Europe increased today as two nurses with possible exposure to the deadly virus were rushed to hospital with suspicious symptoms in two countries.

A patient in Denmark was admitted to hospital with symptoms of Ebola, in what officials feared could be the country's first case of the deadly disease.

But hours later an official from the Hvidovre Hospital near Copenhagen where the nurse was taken told Reuters test results had come back negative for Ebola. 

The unnamed patient was believed to be an aid worker with Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)who recently arrived in Denmark from West Africa with a fever - one of the first symptoms of the potentially fatal disease.

Earlier, the Danish branch of MSF said in a statement the test was being carried out on one of its employees who had returned from West Africa and felt a 'slight rise' in temperature.

In France, a woman who recently helped treat an Ebola patient in France was rushed to the infectious diseases unit of Begin hospital in Paris with a high fever, Le Parisien reported. 

She reportedly helped tend to a MSF nurse who contracted Ebola in Liberia and was released from a Paris hospital earlier this month after successful treatment.

If Ebola was confirmed, it would be the first case of Ebola transmission within France.

Meanwhile, Spanish nurse Teresa Romero, the first person to contract Ebola in Europe, his well enough to spend time out of bed in her isolated ward in Madrid.

She has been able to speak to her husband Javier by telephone - but he has not yet revealed that her beloved pet dog Excalibur has been put down.

Teresa, 44, yesterday spent ten minutes chatting to Javier, who is also  in isolation after being placed in quarantine as a precautionary measure.

A cousin of the nurse told Madrid media: 'She is already getting up and sitting down, drinking liquids and showing energy. Just getting here is quite a triumph and the most critical days are behind us.'

But she stressed that Teresa was still seriously ill and could suffer a relapse. 

The nurse's dog Excalibur was seized and euthanized by Madrid authorities after Teresa was admitted to hospital suffering from the deadly virus.

This was despite protests across the city, and 30 to 40 animal rights activists taking up positions outside the Romeros' apartment complex, determined to prevent officials from entering

'I'm in the hospital and I'm making a call to all people to help me save my dog Excalibur because they want to kill him just like that, without following any procedure,' Javier said in a video appeal from his hospital room where he was being quarantined. Within hours, the cause went viral.

On Twitter, the hashtag SalvemosaExcalibur - 'Let's Save Excalibur' - was tweeted nearly 400,000 times in 24 hours.

Excalibur was 'sedated beforehand to avoid suffering,' Madrid's regional health agency said in a statement.

The corpse was then 'put into a sealed biosecurity device and transferred for incineration at an authorized disposal facility,' the statement said.

The health agency said that the dog was killed because it posed a risk of transmitting the disease to humans.

There is no documented case of Ebola spreading to people from dogs. But at least one major study suggests dogs can get the disease without showing symptoms. Experts say they are uncertain of what risk that poses to humans.
