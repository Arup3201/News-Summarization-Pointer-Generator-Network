The price of olive oil  is set to soar after a widespread failure of the annual harvest in large parts of Italy.

A wet summer in combination with a fruit fly blight has led to some producers not harvesting at all this year.

The price is expected to rise by £2 a bottle after production fell by up to 80 per cent in some areas of Italy, a farmers' cooperative said.

Silvio Bandinelli of the Tuscan Olive Growers Coop said: ‘The new oil will cost 2-3 euro more per litre compared to last year, or an average of 10 euro a litre.

Some producers have decided not produce extra virgin because the flavour of the oil will be too acidic. 

Others have cut their losses by not harvesting at all, according to the Confederation of Agricultural producers in Italy (CIA).

Renzo Modesti of CIA in Florence said that the hot spring followed by a wet summer had led to a poor start to the year.

He explained: ‘Because of this we were already expecting a harvest of less than 20 per cent. But the arrival of the fruit fly has blown everything up in smoke.

Liquid gold: The price is set to rise by £2 per bottle

'There are so many small and medium producers who this year will not harvest because the fly has eaten all their olives leaving only the skin and the stone.'

The olive fruit fly or Bactrocera oleae, lays its egg in a hollow in the olive and when hatched the larvae tunnels its way out gnawing at the flesh destroying the fruit.

Only those larger farms with technical prowess to treat their trees with pesticides managed to reduce their losses by around a third.

Filippo Chiocchini, who owns an organic farm Poggio al Sole near Florence, said he had suffered losses of 30,000 euros.

He wrote on Facebook:’The organic farms have been hit worse than the others by this fatal year. It’s a shame to give up the harvest but this is real farming which depends on natural methods.'

Paolo Calosi owner of a farm in in Sesto Fiorentino, Tuscany, where 1000 trees were hit by the fly, said: ‘Unfortunately this year we will not produce extra virgin oil because the fly has damaged all the trees. 

'This will produce a very acidic oil which cannot be sold as extra virgin.

'It will in any case have a nasty aftertaste with a marked woody flavour.'

Roberto Nocentini of Coldiretti Tuscany said: ‘It’s difficult to quantify the loss in production because the situation changes not only from area to area but from grove to grove. Italy may have to import olive oil this year.'
