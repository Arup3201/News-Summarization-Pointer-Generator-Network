A gun-totting thug who blasted a cat nearly two dozen times with a BB gun is being hunted by animal protection groups.

The Animal Alliance is offering a $500 reward after the blood soaked animal, named Callie, was found sprawled in the front yard of her home in Liverpool, New York.

Elderly cat, Callie, had to have more than 20 pellets from a BB gun removed from her body after she was shot in Liverpool, New York

The feline survived the ordeal after being rushed to a vet's clinic where more than 20 BB pellets were removed from her body, Myfoxny,com reported.

The elderly cat also suffered a broken leg in the shooting last month and required surgery for her injuries.

Owner Amy Jenkins is now facing a $2,400 bill to cover the cost of her elderly cat's care.

The young mother contacted the Sheriff's Department after she discovered her badly injured pet sprawled in yard of her home. 

She also said to have spoken with an investigator at the CNYSPCA.

Ms Jenkins is said to be concerned for the safety of children and other pets in the area while the shooter is still at large, according to Myfoxny.

The Animal Alliance has offered a reward of $500  for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the injury to Callie.

They have put posters up around the neighbourhood alerting pet owners and parents to the incident. 

On the reward poster they said: 'Mistreating animals is no longer seen as an isolated incident that can be ignored: it is often a predictor crime and a 'red flag' warning sign that others in the household - or the neighbourhood - may not be safe.' 

The Animal Alliance is offering a $500 dollar reward to catch the thugs who repeatedly shot Callie in Liverpool, New York
