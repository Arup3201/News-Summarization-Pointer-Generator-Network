Buckingham Palace was investigating today after giant images of the Queen were used on the front of a new kebab shop.

Large pictures of HM appeared on the front windows of a takeaway selling burgers, pizzas and doners in Chingford, London.

It recently underwent a complete refurbishment and has been renamed ‘The Queen’ complete with a purple facade and two giant images of Elizabeth II.

The Queen, formerly the Petra Restaurant, offers ‘charcoal grill, peri peri and sisha’ and sells a range of takeway foods.

But the restaurant has caught the attention of The Royal Family and Buckingham Palace say they are looking into the matter.

Pictures of the Queen cannot be used for marketing purposes and can only be used legally by businesses issued with a Royal warrant of appointment.

A Royal Communications Spokesperson said: 'Images of members of the Royal Family should not be used for commercial endorsement.'

But takeaway owner Hussein Ibrahim, 42, thinks his purple kebab shop is the perfect way to show his love for the Queen.

He said: 'I love the Queen and what she’s done for every single person in this country. This is her land and she deserves to have everybody to come here to salute her.

Businesses cannot use pictures of Her Majesty for promotional purposes, and can only legally use her image if they apply for a Royal warrant of appointment

Owner Hussein Ibrahim, 42, has defended his shop, saying that he simply wanted to express his love for the Royal Family

'The Queen makes everybody happy. I believe in this community they are missing this kind of thing, something that brings the community together.'

Britain’s biggest Royal Family fan also slammed the Mr Ibrahim’s decision to ‘cash in on our heritage.’

Margaret Tyler, 70, is thought to have the world’s largest collection of Royal memorabilia, after spending more than 50 years filling her home in Wembley, north London, with more than 10,000 collectables.

She said: 'It’s disgraceful. How dare someone cash in on our heritage. It’s not an homage, it’s an abomination.

'I very much doubt The Queen has ever eaten a kebab, and I very much doubt she ever would. You’re simply not allowed to use Her Majesty as a marketing tool.'
