Police investigating the murder of Michigan teen April Millsap have searched the home of a 66-year-old sex offender and say they are 'zeroing in' on the girl's killer.

Detectives arrested two men on Wednesday for having an illegal marijuana growing operation at the home in Goodells, Michigan - 15 miles from the walking trail where 14-year-old April was found dead last Thursday.

The owner of the home is James VanCallis, a registered sex offender who was convicted in 1995 of sexually abusing a child younger than 13, WJBK-TV reports. Authorities would not say whether VanCallis is a suspect in April's murder.

The FBI and local police spent eight hours searching the home in Goodells, Michigan, on Wednesday. The house is about 15 miles from where April was found murdered

A man who appeared to be VanCallis was seen being taken away from the home in handcuffs, but authorities wouldn't confirm whether he was arrested.

Neighbors told the Macolm Daily newspaper that he shouted that police were arresting him 'on only 15 marijuana plants.'

Neighbors also told the newspaper that they often see a blue-and-white motorcycle parked at the house, which matches the description of a vehicle seen in the area shortly before April was found dead last week.

April was found dead in a ditch near Macomb Orchard Trail by joggers. Her faithful dog Penny, whom she walked on the trail every night, was guarding her body.

Detectives say that before her murder, she sent a frantic text message to her boyfriend saying, 'OMG... I think I'm being kidnapped.'

Neighbors say VanCallis has lived at the home for at least nine years - and it frequently seen riding on his blue-and-white motorcycle.
