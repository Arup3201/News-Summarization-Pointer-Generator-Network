Rosie Huntington-Whiteley modelling her first ever lingerie collection called 'Rosie for Autograph' designed in partnership with Marks & Spencer

She is earned her fortune thanks to her phenomenal figure and her passion for lingerie.

But Devon-born model, actress and now designer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 25, has revealed she didn't always have the assets she does today.

In fact, she earned the nickname Tit-lips at school, because she had more padding on her mouth than she did on her chest.

Discussing the new line of lingerie she has designed for Marks & Spencer, the Victoria's Secret Angel said she was given the moniker during her younger years because she had big lips and no cleavage.

Happily for her career, those days passed, and Rosie - who has modelled underwear for brands including Chantal Paris, Agent Provocateur and Monsoon - is these days very well-known for her fine feminine form.

'It wasn't a plan. It's just naturally my look, I guess,' she explained to Stylist. 'I felt really empowered doing lingerie shoots.

'Lingerie is the ultimate feminine buy and I love the feeling it gives women, the empowerment. I love that it's for women only and then men afterwards.'

Rosie had been approached by other brands to design a line of underwear, but none of them felt right for her to put her name to.

Then along came Marks & Spencer, to whom the model felt a very personal connection since it was the shop where she had, despite her Tit-lips nickname, bought her very first bra.

'I love Marks & Spencer: it's so iconically British. Everybody shops there, it doesn't matter whether you've got a massive income or not. It just told a nice story for me. I brought my first bra there.'

Rosie said she bought her first ever bra at Marks & Spencer, which motivated her to design a range for the company

Rosie's range of 1920s-inspired underwear for M&S, comprising a 33-piece collection, went on sale last month and the pieces have proved to be extremely popular.

She said: 'To find inspiration for the collection I trawled my favourite vintage shops and flea markets in London, LA and Paris.

'I found a treasure trove of gorgeous clothes and ornate pieces of jewellery, as well as pictures and patterns in old design books and fashion magazines.

'I was particularly drawn to the opulent elegance of the Twenties.'

Rosie, who is dating British actor Jason Statham, 45, delighted her 117,612 Twitter followers recently by posting pictures of herself modelling her various newly released designs.

Speaking about her lacy, vintage-inspired line, Rosie said: 'Beautiful lingerie makes me special from the inside out. This Rosie for Autograph collection is made with luxurious silk and exquisite French-designed lace. These ultra-feminine fabrics are so elegant and soft next to your skin. I hope you love wearing them as much as I do, enjoy.'
