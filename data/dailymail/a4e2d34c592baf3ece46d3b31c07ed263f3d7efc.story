She already has a stellar music career, her own fragrance and a beauty line with MAC - all to the tune of a reported £170m - but Rihanna clearly wants world domination.

The Bajan singer, who took home the best-dressed gong at the prestigious CFDA awards this year, may well be launching her own fashion range.

The 26-year-old, who has already designed collections for Armani and River Island, has filed trademark documents in her surname, Fenty, for apparel, lingerie, hats, sleepwear, cosmetics and swimwear.

Will she, won't she? Rihanna, who took home best dressed at the prestigious CFDA awards this year, may well be launching her own fashion range

According to Vogue.co.uk, the documents have been filed with the USPTO under her Roraj Trade LLC.

The style icon certainly has design experience, launching her debut range for Armani back in November 2011.

She also 
lent her fashion expertise to Styled to Rock, where she assisted 
up-and-coming British designers with their clothing lines.

In February 2013, the singer presented her first women's collection at 
London Fashion Week for River Island. The sporty urban range was such a 
hit that she released two more collections for the high street giant.

Let's hope she's venturing into fashion! The documents have been filed with the USPTO under her Roraj Trade LLC, and has assigned the 'Fenty' mark

Well, it makes sense! The global style icon has sat front row at countless fashion shows and modelled for numerous high fashion brands like Balmain

A regular 
on the Fashion Week front rows, she has also lent her good looks to 
countless high fashion campaigns and topped best dressed lists around 
the world.

Sharon Daboul, trademark attorney at EIP in London, said: 'It’s natural for global celebrities like Rihanna to want to 
trademark all the insignia for which they are known, and the best time 
to register a trademark is prior to launch, as is the case for the FENTY
 brand. 

'Trademarks
 can include names, nicknames, signatures, slogans and poses and it’s 
important for celebrities to have their legal protection in order at the
 outset.

'Celebrities
 are global brands, now more than ever before. A successful trademark 
registration will ensure Rihanna has the monopoly over her brand. If 
celebrities do not capitalise on their trademarks, no doubt there will 
be someone else who is waiting in line to do it for them. 

'Whilst
 Rihanna made her name as a performer, her name and image can be used to
 sell a huge array of merchandise from clothing to cosmetics. This can 
generate an income that outlives her years as an entertainer, and has 
the potential to become her most important asset, and her lasting 
legacy. An example is the tennis champion Fred Perry, whose name is 
associated with sportswear and fashion, over and above his tennis 
career.'

Fashionable friends: Rihanna (right) is close with model Cara Delevingne (centre) and Joan Smalls (back), would they model her range?

'The best way for celebrities to protect their name for product ranges like fashion is to get a trade mark registration. This effectively guarantees that no-one else can use their name without permission. It's becoming an increasing trend for celebrity artists to cash in on their name by diversifying into fashion lines, added Jason Rawkins, head of fashion at law firm Taylor Wessing. 

And if that wasn't enough, it seems that her trip to Brazil for the tail-end of the World Cup may have been equal parts business and pleasure.

According
 to reports, the Diamonds singer has her eyes firmly fixed on buying a 
UK football club, after she's set up a soccer academy in her native 
Barbados.

Practice makes perfect: In February 2013, the singer presented her first women's collection at London Fashion Week for River Island

A
 source said: 'At first we thought Rihanna's desire to be involved with 
soccer on a business level would soon blow over. We figured she was 
still on a high from the World Cup.

'But
 now it's becoming clear she really is serious. She's talking about 
setting up a football academy in her native Barbados. Then her big dream
 is to be involved with a UK club.'

While 
Rihanna has designs on getting her hands on a British team, the 
26-year-old beauty has also reportedly been considering options closer 
to her Tinsel Town home.

A
 source told the Daily Star: 'Britain is like a second home to her, 
although she's also hinted she may do something with an LA team.'
