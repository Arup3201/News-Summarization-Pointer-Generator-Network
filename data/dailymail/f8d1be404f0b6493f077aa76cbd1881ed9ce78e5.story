New Year's Eve revellers could be at risk because thousands of police civilian staff - including 999 call handlers - will strike today to coincide with a fresh walkout by firefighters.

About 7,500 civilian police workers in London will take action for 24 hours in a row over pay while Fire Brigades Union (FBU) members in England and Wales will stop work for six hours from 6.30pm.

Police officers won't be striking because they are banned from taking strike action by law.

The industrial action will hit public services during one of the busiest nights of the year for the emergency services, while forecasted stormy weather could also have dire consequences for those celebrating the arrival of 2014.

New Year strike: Police civilian workers, including PCSOs and 999 call handlers, will join firefighters 
in a strike tonight. Police staff will strike for 24 hours while firefighters will strike for six hours from 6.30pm

Heavy rain and gale-force winds are expected to sweep across the UK today and this evening causing misery and travel chaos for New Year revellers.

It will be the eighth strike by the FBU since September in a bitter dispute over pensions and the retirement age.

The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union called the London strike in protest at a below-inflation 1 per cent rise.

Police community support officers, 999 call handlers, detention officers in custody suites and a range of administration and professional support staff are among those who will take action.

Striking police civilian staff have set up pickets in protest. Speaking at the picket outside New Scotland Yard in central London, PCS president Richard Rooney, 44, described the issue as a 'crisis'.

'What we’re saying is a fair deal for all, we need a living wage. This is a living wage crisis,' he said.

'We’ve run out of negotiations at the moment. They say there’s no more money and we believe there is, and we also believe a pay freeze is totally unfair.

'Our members are the ones who are suffering and unfortunately once again those who are lowest paid pay the highest price.

“Our message is not just to our employer, who we’ve had good relations with over the years, it’s actually to Government.'

His colleague, Val Paris, 46, was also part of the group of around 20 protesters and said morale at the Metropolitan Police was 'very low'.

'People are just at the stage where we really are doing the job that we’ve done for years, we’re committed to Londoners, we’re committed to working for London, and we’re really just not getting any reward, no recognition of what we do. Management just seem to see police staff as nothing,' she said.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 
'The PCS has now informed the MPS that they intend to take strike action
 on New Year's Eve - one of the days when demand for our services is 
highest.

'We have tried-and-tested business continuity plans for all eventualities, including industrial action.

'These
 ensure that critical functions performed by police staff are performed 
by police officers who are fully trained in those roles.

'To ensure we are able to implement these plans, we stopped granting any further requests for annual leave or days off for officers and staff in a number of key areas for New Year's Eve in mid-December.

'In some cases we've also had to take the very difficult decision to cancel planned days off for officers with certain critical skills or in critical operational areas.

'These are clearly all steps we'd rather not take but we have to be prepared to maintain critical operational areas in the event of a strike action by police staff, and we are confident that we have appropriate plans in place.'

FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: 'Firefighters on duty over the festive period don't have much to celebrate this year and tomorrow's strike will remind the government of the service we provide 24 hour a day, 365 days a year, every year of our careers.

'Nobody wants these strikes but firefighters remain extremely angry over the prospect of being priced out of their pensions and facing the sack owing to the Government's ludicrous pretence that men and women of 60 can meet the same fitness standards as 20-year-olds.

'The Government at Westminster has acknowledged our concerns but not done anything to seriously address them.'

The union said the current storms and floods had highlighted the valuable and wide-ranging job firefighters do. A further strike is being held for two hours from 6.30am on Friday.

The Government said firefighters will still receive generous pensions and has criticised the strikes.

The Met Office said further heavy rain and gales are expected to herald the start of 2014.

Thousands of people across the UK are still recovering after storms last week caused widespread misery, with power cuts and flooding ruining Christmas for scores of families.

Forecasters say there is more bad weather to come, with the Met Office issuing a severe weather warning for rain on New Year’s Day, affecting southern England and western Scotland.
