An estate agent to the rich and famous is celebrating after selling £3billion worth of property - on the same London street.

Trevor Abrahmsohn has cornered the market on one of the world’s wealthiest roads, The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead Garden Suburb, north London - known as ‘Billionaires’ Row’.

Over the last 35 years he has handled 150 house sales on the street at an average value of £20million at today’s prices.

'Whenever there has been an explosion 
of wealth from natural resources or if there is a political uprising 
people look to buy in The Bishops Avenue.

'This has happened with the oil and gas booms in Nigeria and Eastern Europe and when there was the Islamic uprising in Iran.

'The
 road is perfectly located, has two golf courses, you can land a 
helicopter in the garden and you’re only 20 minutes from the centre of 
London.

'Over the years I 
have dealt with royal families, politicians, leading industrialists. 
I’ve sold 95 per cent of the houses on the street and 98 per cent of 
sales come through us.

'In the 1980s, I sold one home to a 
blind Sheikh who would walk around the property while his nurse carried a
 glass of whisky for him.

'It is the sort of sale you pray for. I just had to convince his entourage it was the right property and he bought it.

'When
 I sold Toprak Mansion in 2008 for £50million, we threw a party and 
former Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev flew in for it. That was one 
of the best properties I have ever sold.'

Despite his success, Mr Abrahmsohn  doesn’t arrive at properties in a Rolls-Royce or Mercedes, instead zipping to viewings in his trusty little Smart car.
