A vaginal whitening wash that promises to make your private area 'safely fairer within four weeks' has hit the beauty market in Thailand.

The latest product, called Lactacyd White Intimate, comes after huge controversy was sparked when 18 Again- an Indian pharmaceutical 'vaginal 
tightening and rejuvenating cream' came onto the market earlier this year.

The latest product's advert, which is online, on TV and on radio, shows an attractive, fair-skinned young woman complaining about how tight shorts can leave skin looking darker.

The latest product has been released despite controversy over India's 18 Again vagina tightener

She then waltzes off in a tiny pair of white shorts as a voice-over states that the product can help skin become 'bright and translucent'.

In a country where fair skin is synonymous with success, skin and body hair whitening products are readily available - and the industry is expected to reap $2bn this year alone- but this is the first vaginal whitening wash to hit the shelves.

When 18 Again hit the shelves in India, not only did women voice the opinion 
on Twitter that 18 Again was created by Ultratech purely to cash in on 
female insecurities, but many criticised the accompanying TV 
advert.

The awkward commercial, set in an 
extended family household, involves a woman dancing around the internal 
courtyard with her husband.

She repeatedly sings lines borrowed and from Madonna's Like A Virgin (but given a Bollywood makeover),Â  including 'ooh, I feel 
like a virgin' and 'it feels like the first time'.

At the end of the advert an elderly couple are seen using a computer, inferring that they are ordering some cream top spice up their own sex lives

Her husband grabs her waist and warbles 'oh, yes it's true' while an elderly couple of parents look on, seemingly aghast.

The
 film ends with a shot of the product, then a clip of the intrigued 
elderly couple apparently using the internet to order some of the cream 
for themselves.

Rishi Bhatia, chairman and managing director of Ultratech India, said: '18 Again is a first-of-its-kind product for women in India.

'This 
product is being launched in India post clinical trials conducted 
among women of all age groups under dermatological control.

'18 Again 
has the power and the potential to break the shackles and redefine the 
meaning of women empowerment altogether.'
