A second British jihadi has been killed fighting for the Islamic State in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane, it has been claimed.

ISIS supporters on social media were yesterday mourning the death of 20-year-old Muslim convert Abu Abdullah al-Habashi, also known by a second nom de guerre of Abu Abdullah al-Britani.

They now claim Abu Dharda, 20, also known as Abu Dhar Somali, was killed fighting alongside militants in the city.

Dead: Abu Abdullah al-Habashi (pictured right, next to a militant named Abu Musa as-Somali ) has been killed fighting in Kobane. The 20-year-old former Christian of Eritrean origin converted to Islam as a teenager

Al-Habashi, from north London, was of Eritrean origin and converted from Christianity to Islam during his teenage years. He is understood to have travelled from the UK to join the Islamic State in Syria in December 2013. 

Abu Dharda, from west London, came from a British-Somali background and travelled to Syria via Turkey in the same month as al-Habashi.

Neither death has been independently verified. Their families could not be contacted and police said they could not comment. 

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said they were aware of the reports but that it was extremely difficult to get confirmation of deaths of injuries, due to UK consular services being suspended.  

Al-Habashi was a well known and popular figure in Islamic State due to his media appearances. 

In August, he was interviewed on BBC Newsnight, where he admitted that his family had been trying to persuade him to return home but he had insisted there was 'no going back.'

He confidently says in the interview: 'They say what all parents would say, 'come back you're crazy etc.' But I'm here for the sake of Allah.' 

Threat: In his video appearance last month, al-Habashi gesticulated wildly as he said 'We will chop off the heads of the Americans, chop off the heads of the French, chop off the heads of whoever you may bring'

The United States and its allies have staged 30 air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq since Wednesday, the U.S. Central Command said on Friday.

The 23 strikes in Iraq included six near Baiji that hit Islamic State buildings, vehicles and tactical units while buildings, vehicles, a guard post and two tactical units were destroyed near Sinjar in four air strikes, Central Command said. 

Similar targets were destroyed or damaged west of Kirkuk, near Mosul and Ramadi and in Tal Afar.

In Syria, six strikes near Kobani destroyed staging areas, buildings and two tactical units, while another near Ar Raqqah damaged an Islamic State barrack, Central Command said.

The British fighter also told Newsnight that he had been fighting with Islamic State in Ramadi, Iraq. He described it as 'the best fighting and the hardest fighting' and that 'US-made weapons was the war booty.'

Last month, the British fighter appeared alongside a German and a French ISIS fighter in the IS video, 'Wait. We are also waiting.'

In the video, Abu Abdullah describes the West as being full of 'puppets and apostates'. 

He declares: 'We are waiting for you in Dabiq. We are waiting for you in Iraq so bring your coalition of unbelievers because unbelievers will not help you. We will take their weaponry as booty and these people will die.'

The British jihadist vows that all Islamic State fighters 'are willing to lay down our blood on this soil. So try. Try to come and we will kill every single soldier.'

'We will chop off the heads of the Americans. We will chop off the heads of the French, chop of the heads of whoever you may bring.'

He even promised that the black flag of the Islamic State will 'eventually be on the White House.' 

Al-Habashi also appeared in another IS video, entitled 'Eid Greetings from the Land of the Khilafah.' 

The video, released in August, featured the British fighter alongside fighters from Finland and America.

In the video, the Londoner glorifies life under the Islamic State: 'I don't think there is anything better than living in land of the Khilafah.'

'You know the rights and you are not living under oppression. You are not living under rule. You are not living under the kufr [non-believer]. You are living by the Koran and by the Su'rah.

'As Muslims, that's what we want and that's what we need. We don't need any democracy, we don't need any communism, we don't need anything like that. All we need is Sharia.

Abu Abdullah al-Habashi also made headlines for a photo showing him posing next to a decapitated Syrian soldier. 

The photo shows al-Habashi proudly smiling next to the victim, who was tied up and beheaded.

Meanwhile, a tweet on November 7 believed to be from the account belonging to Abu Dharda warned there would be 'more bloodshed' in Kobane.

The tweet said: 'There are hundreds of pkk dead from Kobane battles so far but inshallah soon those hundreds will turn to thousands.. expect more bloodshed.'

According to the BBC, Dharda was believed to have been questioned by counter-terrorism police at a British airport as he travelled towards Syria.

But he was allowed to continue his journey because officers were satisfied with the explanation he gave for the purpose of his trip.
