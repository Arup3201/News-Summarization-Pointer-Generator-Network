A young woman left paralysed after an accident at work  said a boob job gave her the confidence and motivation to learn to walk again.

Nicola Woodman, 26, from Stafford in the West Midlands was distraught when she was left partially paralysed after a lifting injury at work.

The lack of feeling in her lower body meant she was forced to wear a colostomy bag, which ruined her confidence.

She decided to undergo a breast enhancement operation to improve her self-esteem. 

Nicola Woodman, 26, from Stafford, was left partially paralysed (left) and fitted with a colostomy bag after an accident at work. To improve her self-esteem and encourage her recovery she underwent breast enlargement surgery which gave her the confidence learn to walk again, and even go on holiday (right)

Her breasts went up five cup sizes, from 32A to 32E and she credits the operation in helping her recover.

She said: 'I feel amazing now I've got big boobs, I love them.

'They look fantastic and have helped my recovery as I'm full of confidence.

'I was going through rehab before my boob job, and was slowly taking a few steps, but my boob job has really helped me to walk properly again.

'I feel like a different person.'

She added: 'My boob job has given me the lift I needed in order to continue with my recovery.'

Miss Woodman, a healthcare support worker, became paralysed in March 2012 after lifting a patient at work damaged some of the discs in her spine. 

Doctors are still unsure how this led to paralysis, but it was later found that she had degenerative discs in her spine, meaning she might have had a weaker back than usual.

It is thought the fluid between discs in her spine had become thinner than usual in a woman of her age, causing pain and paralysis.

The condition caused her to lose all feeling from the waist to the knee caps, and she has no sensation in her toes.

As the nerves that control the bowel and bladder are located at the base of the spine, Miss Woodman lost the ability to go to the toilet.

She needed a colostomy, an operation where a section of the bowel is diverted and attached to an opening in the wall of the abdomen, where waste can be collected into a drainage bag.

She said: 'It was a really difficult time, but my confidence really hit rock bottom when I had to be fitted with a colostomy bag.

Before Miss Woodman's accident (right) she was  healthy, but after hurting her back at work doctors discovered she might have degenerative discs in her spine (left)

'I knew the colostomy bag was the best decision as I just couldn't feel anything, but it really affected my self-esteem.'

Miss Woodman had been going to rehab in order to learn to walk again. But due to her slow progress she decided she needed something to lift her mood.

So in July this year she decided a breast enlargement surgery would give her the motivation to keep working at her recovery.

She said: 'I knew having a boob job would help boost my confidence, so I decided to go ahead.

'I'd always hated my 32A boobs anyway.

'I didn't want small boobs for any longer and after a friend recommended a great surgery clinic to me, I booked in for a free consultation.

'My new 32E boobs felt amazing, they've changed my life.'

Before Miss Woodman's accident, she was an active and healthy woman who had never had any back problems.

She said: 'Before my accident at work I had been a completely normal and healthy.

'I had no idea I had a weak back until lifting a patient damaged a few of my discs.'

She added that her partner and family have supported her throughout her ordeal and she knows she couldn't have got through the past year without them.

She said: 'They fully supported my decision to undergo a boob job and they can see how it's changed my life already.

'For seven months I relied on carers to help me at home but finally after regaining my strength I'm leading an independent life.'

Miss Woodman underwent a breast enlargement operation increasing the size of her breasts from 32A to 32E

At first doctors feared Miss Woodman may have meningitis or multiple sclerosis but tests failed to reach any diagnosis.

With no clear conclusion, and after months of being bed-bound, she didn't know if she would ever walk again.

But her breast enlargement gave her the motivation to work hard during physiotherapy, and eventually she was able to take her first few steps.

She has since gone on holiday to show off her new body.

Miss Woodman said: 'I had a few people staring and pointing at my colostomy bag when I was in my bikini but I am proud of it.

'I no longer needed padding in my bikini tops and that filled me with such excitement.'

She hopes one day the feeling in her lower body will return, but at the moment is focused on going to university.

She said: 'I might need an operation in the future but I'm not focusing on that yet.

'I'm started university this week and I'm excited to get on with my life.

'I can finally start looking forward to the future.'
