It is perhaps the most gruesome vehicle ever seen on the roads.

This sinister Ford pickup was spotted in America's Deep South with about  50 dead carcasses hanging from its bodywork.

Barely any part of the surface of the red vehicle is visible, instead covered by the fur of dead animals.

Grim: This sinister Ford pickup was spotted in America's deep south with about 50 dead carcasses hanging from its bodywork

Packed: The truck is made up of raccoons, frogs, alligators and other dead carcass and was spotted in Georgia

Unique: Barely any surface of the red vehicle is visible, instead covered by the fur of dead animals

A stuffed bob-cat looking creature can be seen riding on the roof along with a racoon and a ground hog.

There is even a frog swilling Jack Daniels whiskey next to an alligator.

The Confederate-flag decorated machine and its mystery driver were spotted by photographer Diane Dodd, 43, as she pulled into her local store in Savannah, Georgia.

'When I first saw this as I pulled into the parking space I was in awe,' she said.

Amazed: The photographer who saw the vehicle said she had never seen anything like this vehicle could not stop staring

Interested: The photographer said most people were fascinated by the vehicle

'I had never seen anything like this vehicle and I could not stop staring.

'I had to get pictures because I didn't think anyone would believe me if I just told them about this machine.'

While the identity of the driver and his reasons for covering his pickup in dead animals remain a mystery, Diane explained that he could he a local trapper, hunter or taxidermy enthusiast taking the local hunting-culture to the limit.

Dead: The fur of some of the animals can be seen on the surface of the van

Odd: A frog can be seen swilling Jack Daniels whiskey

The photographer said the driver looked like a rugged- Southern huntsman

She described how surprised 
on-lookers reacted to being confronted with such a grimly decorated 
vehicle while they were out doing their grocery shopping.

'Most people are fascinated,' she said.

'Some people are freaked out I guess but no-one could stop staring in disbelief.

'The driver was a rugged typical Southern huntsman, truck-driving kind of guy.

'Hunting is a huge past-time in the USA, especially in the Southern areas like Georgia.Â 

'It is a very popular sport from deer to birds to alligators.

'Many people around Georgia would say that the Pelt-mobile is the Deep South at its finest.

"Maybe the truck is his form of expression - a kind of modern Southern art.

'I wish I could find the driver and do a proper interview and photo shoot - I think it would be very interesting.'
