Ludogorets defender Cosmin Moti was forced to go in goal for the Bulgarian champions and made two penalty saves to send his side through to Champions League group stage back in August.

Former Southampton and Stoke defender Wayne Thomas kept a remarkable clean sheet for Conference North side Worcester on Saturday.

The 35-year-old, who has played over 500 professional games, started the 2-0 victory over Harrogate on the bench.

However Worcester were left without a recognised goalkeeper after Jose Veiga picked up a knee injury just 30 seconds into the match, prompting Thomas to take the gloves.

Nathan Vaughan, their first-choice keeper this season, was sidelined with a groin injury, leaving Worcester without a replacement on the bench on Saturday.

'We've got two good keepers,' Worcester manager Carl Heeley told BBC Hereford & Worcester. 'And 99 times out of 100, when you have a spare keeper on the bench, he's not used but that's the way it goes.'

'So I got the boys together and asked 'How many of you have ever played in goal?' - that was the selection process. Tommo put his hand up and off he went,' added Heeley.

Thomas' career, spanning over 18 years, has taken the defender from Luton over to Greece, with spells at Stoke, Southampton and Burnley.
