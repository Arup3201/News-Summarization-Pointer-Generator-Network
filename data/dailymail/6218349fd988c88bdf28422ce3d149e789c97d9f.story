Can you give Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Ralph Fiennes or Keira Knightley a new home this new year?

The four  puppies, named after the Golden Globe nominees, need new families after being dumped at Dogs Trust Manchester over the festive period.

It is hoped these pictures of the adorable 11-week-old dark-haired lurchers will be irresistible to dog lovers looking for a new companion in their life.

The puppies were given their names ahead of the awards ceremony on Sunday.

Cumberbatch, for his role in The Imitation Game, and Eddie Redmayne, for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, are both vying for the Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama award.

Knightley, who co-stared in The Imitation Game with Cumberbatch, is up for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture.

Ralph Fiennes is up for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical, for his role in The Grand Budapest Hotel.

People are reminded that a dog is not just for Christmas, and the charity expects to care for about 100 abandoned puppies in the first few weeks of the new year.
