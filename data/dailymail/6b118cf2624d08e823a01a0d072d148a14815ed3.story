Inspirational Christian minister born with no limbs Nick Vujicic was pictured hitting the beach in Maui on Tuesday as he took a much needed vacation ahead of the release of his newest book, in which the Aussie native explains how to overcome bullying.

Vujicic's life is a testament to how one can overcome adversity, but in Stand Strong: You Can Overcome Bullying, the 31-year-old reveals that even he's had to struggle against bullies.

But like his astonishing ability to get around blissfully on a sunny Hawaii beach proves, he's learned what it takes to overcome most any obstacle.

Inspiring: Christian evangelist Nick Vujicic was born limbless, but has turned his life into a source of inspiration for millions worldwide as he's spread his message of hope through public speaking and motivational books

Bullied: Vujicic manages to get around swimmingly now, as evidenced by these April 1 photos of him vacationing in Maui, but he says there was a time when self doubt left him feeling helpless in the face of bullies

Rose above: The 31-year-old says he turned to God and inward to his own strength in order to beat his bullies and he's written a book that's released April 15 in which he shares his bully-beating wisdom,

'I felt alone in my fear of bullies,' he writes in the intro to his new book, available April 15. 'And neither are you.'

The minister, who's shared his inspirational message in 44 countries, describes how to turn bullies into motivators.

'Bullies want to abuse you. Instead of allowing that, you can use them as your personal motivators,' he writes. 'Power up and let the bully eat your dust.'

Happily married: Vujicic and his wife Kanae Miyahara met in 2008. In this photo Kanae shows off the ring that Nick placed on her finger with his mouth

Vujicic's personal story is enough to motivate most anyone into bettering themselves.

The bestselling author who was married to his beautiful wife Kanae Miyahara two years ago was born to Serbian immigrants in Melbourne, Australia.

For medical reasons that remain largely mysterious even to Vujicic, he had no limbs. He does have a small foot on his left hip which helps him balance and enables him to kick.

As a teen he mastered life’s daily tasks and went on to show that he can do everything that able bodied people can do-including writing, typing, play drums, brush his teeth.

Aged 17 he began giving talks at a church group and went on to found a non-profit to use his experience to help others.

Nick's father was a computer programmer and accountant and he taught his little son how to type with his toe at just 6 years old.

His mum invented a special plastic device that meant he could hold a pen and pencil.

Despite the risk of bullying, his parents insisted Nick attended mainstream school.

Nick, who was teased and bullied, had an electric wheelchair for mobility, and a team of carers to help him.

'I was deeply depressed when I was eight years old,' he said. 'I went to my mum crying and told her I wanted to kill myself.'

At age ten Nick, tried to drown himself in the bath but luckily the attempt was unsuccessful.

But with the help of his religion, friends and family, Nick managed to pull through to become an international symbol of triumph over adversity.
