Thug: Christopher Towers, 25, outside prison enjoying his freedom at the weekend barely a year after he was jailed for three and a half years

A young mother left paralysed by a drunken thug only discovered her attacker had been let out of prison early when she saw gloating photos on Facebook.

Claire Hilton was sickened to find pictures of Christopher Towers having fun after serving only a third of his sentence for breaking her neck.

The snaps are thought to have been posted by his girlfriend, who wrote underneath, ‘finally with my boy’.

The case made headlines in November 2011 when Towers was granted bail ahead of sentencing which allowed him to spend Christmas with his family.

Miss Hilton yelled at him during the hearing: ‘Look what you’ve done. You’ve ruined  my life.’

Towers, 25, was jailed for three and a half years in January last year for punching Miss Hilton, in the face after a row over a spilt drink.

Just 15 months after he was put behind bars, he is out on weekend licence, allowing him to spend time with girlfriend Kelly McKone.

After Miss Hilton, 30, came across the picture of him earlier this month, she contacted the police who told her he was due to be released imminently and that as part of his preparation he would be spending a weekend on the outside every 28 days.

Miss Hilton said: ‘When I saw the picture I felt sick to my stomach.

'I couldn’t believe that no-one from the police or probation had warned me.’

Miss Hilton, from Sunderland, had been on a night out with friends at the Wheatsheaf pub in Boldon when trouble flared over a drink that had been knocked over on Towers’s mother, Lynn Flaherty, 47.

The friends offered to buy her another drink but she and her son flew into a rage.

They were ordered out of the pub but waited outside until Miss Hilton and her friends left.

Victim: Claire Hilton, 30, who was left paralysed after Christopher Towers broke her neck with a single punch in the attack

McKone, 31, who was with Towers, hit Miss Hilton and Flaherty slapped one of her friends.

Towers then ran over and punched Miss Hilton.

After spending 12 days in a coma, she was told she had broken three bones in her neck and severely damaged her spinal cord.

Two years after the attack, Miss 
Hilton is still paralysed and said that if it wasn’t for her son Callum,
13, she would not want to live.

‘Doctors have told me I will never 
walk again,’ she added. ‘I thought Christopher Towers’s sentence was a 
joke to begin with, but him being let out this early beggars belief.’

A spokesman for the Ministry of  
Justice said a ‘victim contact  scheme’ was in place to inform  victims 
of developments in offenders’ sentences.

A Prison Service spokesman  said: 
‘Suitable offenders, who  are thoroughly risk-assessed, may  be released
on temporary licence  to assist with their resettlement  into the 
community and their  development of a purposeful, law–abiding life.’
