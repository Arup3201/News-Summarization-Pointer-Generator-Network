A former international ice dancer has returned to the rink - three years after going completely blind.Tracy Compton, 45, says she used her sense of hearing to avoid other skaters.

In her early 20s, she travelled the world, competing for Great Britain in international synchronised skating competitions. 

At 13, Miss Compton, of Morden, south west London, lost the sight in her left eye through a detached retina.

Back in the game: Former international ice dancer Tracy Compton has returned to the rink three years after glaucoma left her completely blind

Nearly 30 years later, glaucoma claimed the sight in her right eye, leaving her completely blind. 

Skating since she was five years old, Ms Compton 'took to it like a duck to water' going on to spend six hours a day skating in her teens. 

Ms Compton stopped skating when she had her first three children. After returning to it briefly in her early thirties, she stopped again when her mum died in 2007.

'My mum used to work in the ice rink shop. When I lost her it was quite hard to go back,' said Ms Compton. 

Supported to get back on the ice by a friend and fellow skater, Ms Compton said: 'I was transported back in time. It was like I'd never been off the ice.'

Heightened senses: Tracy, who suffered detached retinas in her left eye at the age of 13, says she manages to avoid other skaters using her sense of hearing

Ms Compton uses her hearing to avoid collisions with other skaters. She said: 'You can hear somebody's movements. I can hear the skates on the ice. 

'Different moves sound different, like going forward or backwards sound different. I never really thought about it before.' 

'I'm an ice dancer at heart,' said Ms Compton, who is now working towards her level nine ice dance medal. 

The adventurous mother of four and grandmother of three also competes in tandem cycling time trials. 

With a current personal best of 25 miles in 1 hour, 4 minutes, Ms Compton said: 'It's thrilling. I think I've got a thing for speed.
