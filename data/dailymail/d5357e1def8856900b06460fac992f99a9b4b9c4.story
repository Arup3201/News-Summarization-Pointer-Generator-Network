A developer who mistakenly built a $1.8 million waterfront house on parkland in Rhode Island has been ordered to remove it.

The Rhode Island Supreme Court found that the Narragansett home was built entirely on land owned by the Rose Nulman Park Foundation, and therefore must be removed.

The developer, Robert C Lamoureux and his company Four Twenty Corp., began building the home in 2009, but it didn't discover the error until 2011. It argued it should not be penalized for an innocent surveying mistake.

Parkland: This Rhode Island house was built on lands dedicated to recreation and contemplation

Secluded: The house sits in a prime ocean-front position surrounded by uninhabited land on one side and the sea on the other

The court said the park's property rights outweighed that.

The three-storey house on Point Judith has water views from Newport to Watch Hill and a rooftop cabana with a Jacuzzi and a wet bar and was completed in January 2011.

The luxurious three-bedroom home looks to be the ideal seaside idyll, but has remained uninhabited after a potential buyer conducted a survery and found that the home sits squarely on public parkland.

James E. Kelleher, Lamoureaux's lawyer, asked the court to allow his client to pay for the land or trade it for other waterfront property instead of removing the home, reports the Providence Journal.

He told the court, 'The harm to my client is $1.7 million.'

Luxurious: The home has a wet bar, wraparound balcony and rooftop Jacuzzi - but it's never been inhabited, after a potential buyer found that it had been built on a site dedicated to parklands

Demolish or remove: A court has ruled that the house must go - it's unclear whether it will be demolished or moved to another site

The judge asked why the Rose Nulman Park should give up six per cent of its land to Lamoureux when it had done nothing wrong.

Kelleher argued that Lamoureux hadn't done anything wrong either, and was a victim of a surveying mistake.

He said Lamoureux had paid an engineering firm thousands of dollars to survey the land and was 'utterly shocked' to discover that the actual site of the house had never been surveyed.

Saul Nulman, a New York City businessman, bought land at Point Judith in 1993 and trasferred the land to the foundation in 2006 before he died. The land is dedicated to his mother, Rose Nulman, to be a place of recreation and contemplation.

Foundation lawyer Mark Freel says it's not known whether the unoccupied house can be moved or will have to be torn down.

He says the house has been there for a long time already, and it's time for it to go.
