Liverpool's win over Manchester City on Sunday lifted them to within two points of the Champions League places and Brendan Rodgers' side are one of the hottest teams in Europe right now.

Since the turn of the year, Liverpool - led by the form of Philippe Coutinho - have picked up 20 points from eight games at a remarkable two and a half points per game.

Arsenal, with 18 points from eight games, and Chelsea, who have 14 from seven, have been the next best in the Premier League this calendar year, but Liverpool's quest for Champions League football has outstripped all their rivals.

Arsenal have also begun 2015 well in the league, with 18 points from eight games since New Year's Day

In the top five leagues in Europe only Wolfsburg, who have won five and drawn one of their six games this year, have picked up points at a better rate.

The German side have narrowed the gap to Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich since the beginning of January, but still trail the champions by eight points.

With striker Bas Dost in remarkable form - with 13 goals in his eight games since January 1 - and former Chelsea midfielder Kevin De Bruyne pulling the strings behind him, Wolfsburg now look nailed on for a Champions League spot.

In fact, qualification for Europe's biggest competition links all of the top form teams, with few of 2015's best performers actually challenging for the title in the top leagues around the continent.

In Spain, Valencia's excellent run of just one defeat and one draw in nine games this year has lifted them to within a point of Atletico Madrid in third place, though they are still eight points short of Real Madrid at the top of the table.

The most remarkable upsurge in form comes from Caen, who have picked up 19 points from eight games, having only earned 15 from their  19 matches in the first half of the season. 

The run has seen them earn a 2-2 draw against PSG and beat Marseille 3-2 having trailed 2-0 in both games.

On-loan Argentine foward Emiliano Sala, signed from Bordeaux at the end of January, has scored four times in the last three games as Caen have climbed from bottom of the league on New Year's Day to a comfortable mid-table spot, five points above the drop zone.

Only in Italy have the team top of the league started 2015 with the best form. Juventus have earned 19 points from nine games - the same number as city-rivals Torino - to stretch their lead over Roma at the top of Serie A to nine points.

The top two sides in Italy met on Monday night when they played out a 1-1 draw that keeps Juve on course for a fourth straight Scudetto.
