High street banks gave their customers a helpline number that went through to a card insurance firm which has been fined for £10.5m for mis-selling card protection, according to a Dispatches investigation.

As a consequence millions of customers were duped into buying worthless insurance meant to protect against fraudulent transactions on their credit or debit cards.

In the Dispatches investigation, which is to be aired tonight, the programme claims that in 2006  banks such as Barclays and Natwest made lucrative commercial arrangements with a card insurance firm called CPP.

The Channel 4 programme alleges that a number of banks introduced customers to CPP via a sticker on new credit or debit cards, prompting them to call the company’s number to activate them or confirm receipt of them.

But instead of going through to a helpline operated by the banks, the phone numbers were actually for a call centre run by CPP, reports The Telegraph.

The salesman at the end of the line would then try to foist the insurance policies on callers - they were sold 'unnecessary' card protection insurance, which cost around £35 a year, or identity protection insurance, which cost around £84 a year.

The banks pocketed commission payments every time CPP sold or renewed a policy to one of their customers.

A former CPP manager told Dispatches that the banks even signed off the scripts used by CPP call operatives.

For every policy they sold they made £5.

In November, CPP,  was fined a record £10.5million by the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog.

It faces a total bill of £33.4million, including estimated compensation of £14.5million and costs associated with the investigation, for tactics first revealed by the Mail in February 2011.

A total of 4.4million policies were sold between January 2005 and March 2011, and 18.7million were renewed over this period.

CPP will not contact affected customers until an agreement has been reached with the FSA about how banks will pay for their part in the scandal.

MPs described it as another ‘shocker’ for the financial industry in the wake of the Payment Protection Insurance scandal.

The watchdog said both policies were often worthless as banks are already obliged to refund fraudulent transactions in the vast majority of cases.

It said pushy CPP salesmen also ‘overstated’ the risks of criminals stealing personal details and making fraudulent transactions.
