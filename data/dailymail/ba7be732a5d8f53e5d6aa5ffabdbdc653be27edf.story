 

Billy Joe Saunders has revealed Chris Eubank Jnr has agreed to face him in a mouthwatering domestic grudge match next month. 

The two middleweights have long been bitter rivals but their proposed fight looked to be dead in the water when Saunders said last week that his opponent had not signed a contract.

But the 25-year-old has now confirmed the clash is set for the undercard of Dereck Chisora vs Tyson Fury at the Excel Arena in London on November 29.

'I've been told by Frank [Warren] that he has eventually signed the fight and now I'm looking forward to it and getting in there and smashing him up,' Saunders told the Welwyn Hatfield Times.

'It's what all the fans wanted, and financially it makes perfect sense.

Saunders believes once he's finished 'smashing' Eubank up he will be ready for a world-title shot

'It means once I get this out of the way, I will be 100 per cent ready for a world title shot, which is already sorted.'

That shot looks set to be against the winner of Matt Korobov against Andy Lee, a fight that could take place for the vacant WBO title in Dublin in December.
