A former mayor has cut ties with his own daughter after she stood against him in the local elections and took his seat.

Malcolm Pritchard  launched an astonishing outburst against only daughter Clare after she 'dishonoured' him by putting politics before family.

Speaking after the shock result, Mr Pritchard, who was the mayor of Hyndburn in Lancashire from 2010-2011, said Clare 'no longer exists' to him.

'I wasn't disappointed with the result, I was disappointed with Clare and what she has done,' he said.

'She has broken one of the 10 commandments by dishonouring her mother and father.

'She has put politics before family.'

The pair had been contesting the Accrington North seat in the Lancashire County Council elections last week.

Mr Pritchard was the Independent county councillor 
for Accrington North, until his daughter, standing for Labour, took his seat.

Malcolm Pritchard, pictured during his time as mayor of Hyndburn Council, said his daughter 'doesn't exist anymore' to him after the political battle

'She could have stood anywhere else with our 100 per cent support,' he added

'She was used as a pawn against me.

'At least I have got my wife, my son and my mates.

'Clare has lost her mum and dad for what she's done.

'As far as I'm concerned she doesn't exist anymore and that takes a lot of saying.'

New county councillor Clare Pritchard took the seat by more than 200 votes on a day of gains for the Labour group.

Cllr Clare Pritchard, who is also deputy leader of Hyndburn Council, was first elected as Milnshaw ward councillor at the 2006 borough council elections and retained the seat in 2010.

She said: I'm very pleased that I have won my county council seat.'

Father-of-two Mr Pritchard lost his Milnshaw seat on Hyndburn council in 2011 to Labour rival Paul Cox, just after completing his year of office as Mayor.

He represented the Milnshaw ward in Accrington from 2002 as a Labour councillor before quitting the party to become an Independent in 2007.

At the time he cited differences with the former group leader Graham Jones as the main reason for his decision.

He said: 'Two years ago I was absolutely devastated to lose my borough seat but this time I'm not bothered.'
