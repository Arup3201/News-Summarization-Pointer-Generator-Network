Madonna had confessed that her eldest child, daughter Lourdes, is 'horrified' by the sexually explicit content of some of her mother's new music. 

During the second half of an interview with the Today show's Carson Daly, the 56-year-old singer, explained that all four of her children - nine-year-olds David and Mercy, Rocco, 14, and Lourdes, 18 - react to her music in different ways, adding that her daughter Lourdes finds it the most difficult to deal with.

'At this point, Rocco doesn't care,' she said. 'It just goes over his head. He's like, "Oh, mom. Mom's being mom." The other little kids don't really — they're not tuned into that frequency yet. And Lo [Lourdes] is horrified by all of it. She just wants me to be her mom.'

Parental advisory: During the second half of her Today show interview, Madonna admitted that she has found it tough at times keeping the more explicit aspects of her music from her children 

Worry: The 56-year-old chart-topper told Carson Daly that she sometimes struggles to balance her work commitments with her role as a mother

Close call: Madonna joked that 'every time my kids would visit me in the studio, it would just so happen that I'd be working on a song like Holy Water or S.E.X.'

She added: 'Every time my kids would visit me in the studio, it would just so happen that I'd be working on a song like Holy Water or S.E.X.' she said, referring to two of the tracks from her new album Rebel Heart, which is released today. 

'And I'd be like, "OK, just could - I’ll be - stay outside. I'll be right out."'

But, while her role as a chart-topping icon is clearly of great importance to her, Madonna insists that her number one priority remains her children and her family. 

And, looking at her social media accounts, it's clear to see how well she balances the two aspects of her life; in among all of the promotional pictures from her album and the star-studded snaps taken at glamorous events or behind the scenes on-set are dozens of heart-warming pictures of the singer's beloved children.

Madonna doesn't deny that her work life balance can be tricky at times however - and she admits that keeping track of all of her commitments can be difficult, even at the best of times. 

'The more kids you have, the more responsibilities you have, the more you have to really be aware of time, time management, and juggling lots of balls in the air, and thinking, "Oh, my God, this is how am I gonna do this? How am I gonna promote my record and show up at my daughter's show?"' she said. 

'You know what I mean? It's a tug of war.'

Horrified: Madonna and Lourdes, pictured here in 2010, are incredibly close, however the singer admits that her daughter is embarrassed by some of the sexual content of her songs

Family ties: Madonna and her four children (from left to right) - David, nine, Lourdes, Mercy, nine, and Rocco, 14 - often go away on family vacations together

But no matter what pressures she is facing in her working life, the music veteran is still determined to create as many memories with her children as possible; in January the family enjoyed a fun-filled skiing trip together, while last November, Madonna took her kids to visit Malawi, where her youngest children, Mercy and David, were adopted from.

'I love taking all of my kids there,' she said. 'They walk into hospitals, and tell jokes and stories, and embrace children who are in some pretty extreme states health-wise. 

'And they're not afraid. And I love that. And I love to see them behaving in a generous way towards human beings, you know, outside of their world.” 

Yesterday Madonna, who dropped out of the University of Michigan in 1978, revealed that she offered daughter Lourdes three key pieces of advice, before she enrolled at her mom's alma mater at the start of this school year.

'Try to do everything in moderation,' she said of the wisdom she imparted to her daughter. 'Try not to kill all your brain cells. And try to go to class.'  

And while to many, Madonna is a globally-successful super star, she added that - when it comes to her daughter - she worried and frets just like any other mother. 

'I'm very, you know, worried,' she told father-of-three Carson. '[I always ask her]: "Are you OK? Are you getting enough sleep? Are you eating right?" 

Social media fun: Madonna often shares images of her children on her Instagram account, such as these pictures of Mercy (L) and David (R) 

Chart-topper: Madonna's newest album Rebel Heart (pictured) has just been released 

'You know, I set up a humidifier in her room with eucalyptus oil. I was worried about the fact that she didn't have enough towels, Q-tips, you know.' 

But, despite her constant worries about her teenage daughter, who is following in her mother's footsteps by studying performing arts, it doesn't look like Madonna will be allowed anywhere near the campus in the near future - at least if Lourdes has anything to do with it. 

'I'm not allowed at [football] games,' she admitted. 'You think my daughter wants me at a game?'

Luckily, the chart-topper isn't short of activities to help her take her mind off her daughter's college activities. 

The mother-of-four will release her 13th studio album, Rebel Heart, tomorrow, three months after someone leaked early versions of more than a dozen of the songs online.

And although she is looking forward to the release - explaining that she is both 'excited' and 'nervous' - Madonna admitted that she is still 'frustrated' by the whole incident.  

'I mean, it's a process,' she said. 'Music is really personal to me. A lot of the stuff is out there that I had no intention of ever finishing. 

'They're, like, scribbles on a pad. You know what I mean? It's unspeakably embarrassing.'
