George Zimmerman is hiding in a secret safe house in Seminole County, Florida, protected 24 hours a day by a private security team.

The former neighborhood watch volunteer has stepped up his security after being released from jail on $1 million bail because he is forced to stay in the same community where he killed Trayvon Martin.

Zimmerman's supporters say he has received thousands of death threats since the shooting in February in Sanford, Florida, which he claims was self-defense.

Freed: George Zimmerman, centre, leaves Seminole County Jail after posting a million dollar bond

Out: The bond had been set less than 24 hours earlier. His previous bond of $150,000 was revoked for misleading the courts about his finances

Zimmerman's 
lawyers were able to post the bond with help from an influx of $20,000 
in donations to their client's defense fund after a desperate plea on 
its website, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

The $20,000 added 
to the balance of $211,000 in the defense fund, which was more than 
enough to cover the 10 per cent non-refundable portion charged by 
bonding companies.

'He is very happy 
to be out. It's been a very sobering experience spending the last month 
in jail,' Zimmerman's attorney Don West told reporters on Friday 
afternoon.

Another attorney for Zimmerman, Mark O'Mara, said that the team had secured a temporary safe house for his client.

He
 is required to stay in the county and must be electronically monitored,
 can't open a bank account, obtain a passport or set foot on the grounds
 of the local airport. He has a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.

He will be required to pay $9.50 a day to the sheriff’s office for the cost of the monitoring.

The terms of Zimmerman’s release include tighter restrictions than before, including a requirement that he remain within Seminole County, though his attorney said they were going to petition the judge to be more flexible on where he can stay due to safety aspects.

West told Dave D'Marko of Central Florida News 13 that the defense team had taken steps to protect Zimmerman but that off-duty officers are not being paid to shield him. 

A
 judge set Zimmerman's bond at $1 million on Thursday. His previous 
$150,000 bond was revoked after prosecutors presented evidence to that 
he had misled the court about his finances.

The
 statement pleading for funds on Zimmerman's legal defense fund website 
had contained some of the most urgent language yet from the legal team.

Accused: Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer, is accused of murdering Trayvon Martin

'We
 steadfastly maintain that George Zimmerman acted in self-defense and 
that he is not guilty of second degree murder,' the statement read.

'For those that 
think Mr. Zimmerman has been treated unfairly by the media, for those 
who feel Mr. Zimmerman has been falsely accused as a racist, for those 
who feel this case is an affront to their constitutional rights – now is
 the time to show your support.'

The
 statement added Zimmerman had to pay a bail bond company $100,000 
dollars – 10 per cent of the $1 million dollar bail – and be able to show he
 had collateral worth $1 million.

The bond was 
raised to $1 million dollars after it emerged Zimmerman 
had allowed his wife Shellie to mislead the court about how much money they 
had during an April 20 bond hearing.

The couple failed to disclose at least $130,000 in donations, made through a PayPal account.

Reenactment: In a video taken a day after the attack, Zimmerman claimed Martin had pushed him to the ground and went for his gun. Zimmerman said he fired the weapon in self defense

Prosecutors argued 
Zimmerman and his wife talked in code during recorded jailhouse 
conversations about how to transfer the donations to different bank 
accounts.

Zimmerman at one point asked how much 
money they had. She replied '$155' but prosecutors allege that was code for
 $155,000.

Shellie Zimmerman faces arraignment at the end of the month on a perjury charge; she was freed on bond.

During Zimmerman's second bond hearing, his 
attorney, Mark O'Mara, said that his client was confused, fearful and 
experienced a moment of weakness when he and his wife misled the court.

But the judge didn't buy it and accused 
Zimmerman of making plans to flee to avoid prosecution, misleading 
O'Mara by not disclosing his money and trying to manipulate the judicial
 system.

'The evidence is 
clear that the Defendant and his wife acted in concert, but primarily at
 the Defendant’s direction, to conceal their cash holdings,' Judge Kenneth Lester wrote in his statement on Thursday.

Second chance: On Thursday, Judge Kenneth Lester gave Zimmerman a second opportunity to be released while he await trial by setting the bond. The judge had revoked his bond last month

Zimmerman is charged with 
second-degree murder in Martin's death.

He shot the unarmed youth dead on February 
26 in a gated community but has claimed he acted in self-defense when 
Martin knocked him over and began smashing his head against the ground.

Zimmerman's release comes after Martin's mother said she was disappointed by the judge's
 decision to give Zimmerman another chance at posting bond and 
leaving prison before trial.

Martin's
 mother, Sybrina Fulton, spoke at a news conference on Friday with the Rev.
 Al Sharpton.

She said that knowing her son's killer 'may walk free 
sometime, one day, it really hurts'.

Martin's 
family is in New Orleans to attend the Essence Music Festival, an annual
 musical extravaganza that also tackles themes of importance to 
African-Americans, such as education and the criminal justice system.
