In disgrace: Commander Sarah West, 41, was dramatically removed from the frigate HMS Portland amid claims she was having an affair

Royal Navy top brass were last night accused by women MPs of ‘disgraceful’ sexual prejudice over their treatment of a female warship captain stripped of her command after allegations of an affair with a male officer.

Commander Sarah West, 41, was dramatically removed from the frigate HMS Portland and flown back to Britain in disgrace after reports emerged that she was having a relationship with a male subordinate officer. 

West – the first woman to captain a frontline warship in the Navy’s 500-year history – was hauled off her ship amid claims she breached the military’s strict codes of social conduct.

She was also accused of letting down women in the services for allegedly getting involved with a married colleague, Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray, 37, while on operations.

While the MoD has confirmed that Cmdr West has been removed from her command, they have refused to say what action, if any, Lieut Cmdr Gray will face.

Two female Labour MPs questioned if a man would have been subjected to such swift military justice or similar public humiliation.

Gisela Stuart, a member of the Commons Defence Select Committee, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I am wondering that if she had been a man and it had been the other way around whether the [military] machinery would have managed to move with such speed. 

'It is all rather sad. I think she has probably been judged more harshly than a man in a similar position would have been. There is a lack of clarity over what has been proved and what the consequences are for those involved.’

Madeleine Moon, another committee member, said West’s treatment by the Navy had been ‘disgraceful’.

She added: ‘The treatment of Sarah West gives out a message that women who achieve her rank and seniority will be punished in a way that is more rigorous and more public than if it were a man.’

However the longest-serving woman in Royal Navy history came to the service’s defence. 

Warrant Officer First Class Susan Morgan, who retired from active service in 2012 after a 34-year career, said: ‘The public need not worry about the outcome of this situation. It will be treated with the same sense of equality as with a male commander.’

'Sexism': MPs question whether the same punishment would have been levelled at a man

Sarah West was considered a rising star among her generation of officers. She is now set to be given a lower-profile position in the Navy.

A new, and as yet unnamed, captain has been appointed to HMS Portland, which returned to Britain last weekend after a seven-month deployment around the coastlines of Africa, the Falkland Islands, South America and the Caribbean.

She docked at Plymouth with her second-in-command, Lieut Cmdr Rob Brann, at the helm. Also on board was Lieut Cmdr Gray, who married his second wife in December 2013, just a month before the ship set sail.
