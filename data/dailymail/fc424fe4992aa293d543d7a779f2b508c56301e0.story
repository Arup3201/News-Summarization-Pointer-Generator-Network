A cathedral has formed an all-female choir for the first time in its 1,437 year history.

The 14 girls - aged from seven to 17 - are the first female singers to lead services at Bangor Cathedral in North Wales since it was established in the 6th Century.

Many cathedrals have traditionally always had all-male choirs but  Archdeacon of Bangor, Paul Davies, said the institutions are now waking up to the fact 'girls can sing as well as boys'.

He said: 'There was a perception that
the purest form of treble voice is that of a young boy. But slowly all 
cathedrals are realising that, actually, girls can sing as well as 
boys.'

Bangor Cathedral has broken its own 
ancient tradition going back to 575 AD of only allowing boys and men to 
sing this Christmas with their all-girl group.

The dean of Bangor, the Very Rev Dr Sue Jones, said the all-girls choir was her idea and she's delighted it has now come into fruition.

She said: 'I saw it as my mission to try and encourage and bring girls into the worshiping life of the cathedral.

'There is a problem getting boys to join the cathedral choir. I think it's not cool in society for boys to be part of a choral tradition.

'After 1,437 years, this marks the beginning of a new part of our choral tradition here. It is a natural development that will help to ensure that both boys and girls will be in the choirs, which sing praises for many years to come.'

Choirs of men and boys have been 
singing in the cathedrals and chapels of Britain, almost without 
interruption, for more than a thousand years.

New chapter: As choir numbers were dwlndling because it wasn't seen as 'cool' for boys, allowing girls to take part could help prevent the tradition dying out

In Britain more than 70 still sing regularly for worship - and that number could rise with the introduction of female choirs.

But director of the new all-girls choir Paul Booth said it would take a few years before the group rivalled the men's choir.

He said: 'This choir is in its infancy. It will take us a year or two to establish a repertoire and to make sure we know what we are doing.

'But I think they will be absolutely brilliant and on an equal footing with any choir in the land.'

Fiona Coutts, 15, said the first all-girls choir was a big step in securing the cathedral's choral tradition.

She
said: 'There has been quite a bit of pressure but things are moving 
with the times now. I think if we don't have a girls choir the choral 
tradition might die out.'

The all-girls choir will sing at evensong in Bangor Cathedral every Monday during term time.
