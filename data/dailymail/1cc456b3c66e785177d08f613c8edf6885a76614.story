It could be the most sumptuous meal  you have ever been served – but polish it off in front of the TV and you probably won’t notice. 

Even the finest dish can taste bland  when the telly is switched on, because it causes distractions that ruin our taste perception, say scientists.

And it’s bad news for slimmers as well as gastronomes.

Ditching the dining table for the sofa can also lead us to eat more by removing the sense of how much we are scoffing, the researchers found.

Six out of ten meals in British homes are now eaten while watching TV, but simply switching it off could help reduce calorie intake and improve the enjoyment of a meal, according to the report. 

In a series of experiments, Dutch researchers made diners carry out complicated memory tests while eating food that was either salty, sweet, or sour.

The study, published in the journal Psychological Science, found that those who were distracted by the mental task were more likely to perceive the food as bland. 

Another experiment found they consumed more food in order to obtain  the same taste level and were less aware of how much they ate.

Distracted individuals were more likely to eat crackers that were saltier or add extra sugar to their lemonade.

The report, by Dr Lotte van Dillen of  Leiden University and Reine van der Wal of Raboud University, concluded: ‘These results are highly relevant  in today’s society, in which multi-tasking  is common.

‘When cognitively engaged, such as while watching TV or driving a car, people’s taste perception is likely attenuated, which may contribute to unhealthy eating behaviours, such as increasing the intake of certain foods or adding more of certain flavourings.’

Previous British research has found that eating while distracted can boost consumption by 10 per cent – and at later meals by more than 25 per cent. 

The average Briton now eats 13 meals at home each week – eight of them while watching television, a study earlier this year found.

More than a third of adults told the poll it was normal to eat a meal on the sofa, to not appreciate the food on their plate or notice the flavour.
