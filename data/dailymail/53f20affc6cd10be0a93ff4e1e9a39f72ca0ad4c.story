All three - two males and one female - are 'conscious and breathing', Fox12 reported. 

More than one suspect is believed to have fled the premises in what local media suggests was a gang-related drive-by shooting. 

The school in north Portland is an alternative high school for dropouts and other at-risk or homeless students.

Parents have been summoned to the school.

A nearby high school and community college were put on lockdown.

It is the second school shooting in Portland this year after a Reynolds High School freshman was shot and killed by a classmate in June.

The attack comes just two days before the two-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, when gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults in Newton, Connecticut.
