Lewis Hamilton will head into tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix holding a giant psychological edge over Nico Rosberg after sending his team-mate, and biggest rival for the title, into a spin on Saturday - quite literally. 

Hamilton was in electric form throughout Saturday's qualifying session topping the timesheets in Q1, Q2, and crucially when it mattered, in Q3.

And his dominance in the damp conditions seemingly got under the skin of Rosberg who was ragged throughout.

In a spin: Nico Rosberg will start from the second row after a number of mistakes during qualifying in Shanghai

Difficult day at the office: Rosberg will start only on the second row after rival Lewis Hamilton secured pole

The German, who still leads Hamilton in the championship by 11 points, ran wide on his very first out-lap which set the tone for the remainder of qualifying.

After seeing Hamilton go one second clear following their respective first runs in Q3, Rosberg made a complete hash of his next attempt at pole, running deep at turn 14 – he had been fastest in the first two sectors – before spinning on the exit of the final corner on the following lap.

Rosberg later claimed he took a 'big risk' on his final timed lap after his steering wheel informed him he was two tenths down on his personal best when he was actually half-a-second quicker.

As a result he will start from the second row and behind both Red Bulls tomorrow, and faces an uphill challenge to prevent Hamilton winning once more.  Advantage, Lewis.

On track: Hamilton excelled in the tricky conditions to secure his third pole of the campaign so far

Hamilton can now lay claim to being the greatest qualifier ever to emerge from these shores.

The 29-year-old surpassed Jim Clark's record with his 34th career pole in China, with now only Sebastian Vettel (45), Ayrton Senna (65) and Michael Schumacher (68) ahead of him on the all-time list.

The impressive achievement was somewhat lost on the Briton afterwards, however.  When informed of his new record, Hamilton claimed: 'Oh, really? I didn't know that.'

A dose of short-term memory loss from Hamilton perhaps, considering he talked in such glowing terms of matching Clark's record in Malaysia three weeks ago.

'When they mentioned it, I couldn't believe it,' said Hamilton after securing pole-position in Sepang. 'I'd never have dreamed I would have the amount of poles I have.'

Centre of attention: Lewis Hamilton will start on pole ahead of Daniel Ricciardo (left) and Sebastian Vettel

Daniel Ricciardo maintained his impressive start to his Red Bull career after out-qualifying team-mate Sebastian Vettel for the third time in just four races.

Incredibly, it means the young Australian has now got the better of Vettel more times this season than Mark Webber managed throughout the entirety of 2013.  

We perhaps shouldn't be surprised by Ricciardo's one-lap pace – he often impressed at Toro Rosso, too, only to flatter to deceive on race day – while we must acknowledge too that Vettel suffered with car issues in both Australia and in Bahrain.

Nevertheless, this remains a strong season for the Aussie, Indeed he would have been third in the championship without his disqualification from the campaign opener in Melbourne.

Life in the fast lane: Ricciardo has been hugely impressive in his debut season for Red Bull

The hugely anticipated Fernando Alonso vs Kimi Raikkonen duel at Ferrari has been somewhat of a damp squib so far.

Raikkonen has only seven points to his name – compared to the 26 scored by Alonso – while the Finn failed to progress from Q3; he will start only 11th on Sunday with Alonso six places further up the grid.

Alonso is now 3-1 up on his team-mate in qualifying, and has finished each of opening three races ahead of Raikkonen, too. Indeed, the surly Finn has spent just eight racing laps in front of Alonso this term.

The Ferrari team is built around Alonso, and it's evident that Raikkonen is finding it difficult to muscle his way in.  It appeared an odd decision to re-hire Raikkonen after effectively sacking him in 2009, and while it is the early days of his second career at Maranello, foreseeing an equally disappointing end isn't such a far-fetched theory.

Getting the job done: Fernando Alonso, who will start fifth, is winning the intra-team battle against Kimi Raikkonen

Spinning while taking his eyes off the road, crashing in the pit-lane, and failing to get out of the garage for qualifying; it's about as close to a nightmare weekend as you can get for Pastor Maldonado.

The Venezuelan will start plum last in tomorrow's race after suffering an oil leak on his Lotus.

There was some joy for Maldonado however, whose five-place grid penalty for sending Esteban Gutierrez into a jaw-dropping 360 degree flip in Bahrain effectively becoming irrelevant.

Bad day at the office: Pastor Maldonado has endured a nightmare weekend - he crashed in the pits on Friday
