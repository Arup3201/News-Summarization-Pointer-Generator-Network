She's made history in becoming Venezuela's first ever female minister, but Alejandra Benitez's promise to transform sport in the South American nation is not what's got her countrymen all excited.

Instead, she's the talk of the town after a series of saucy snaps she posed for before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing were re-published online.

The 32-year-old - who fenced for Venezuela during the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Olympics - was revealed as new President Nicolas Maduro's sports minister last week.

On Twitter, she wrote: 'Today starts a 
new challenge and I will assume that challenge with the same commitment 
as an athlete who defends his homeland at all costs.'

Already dubbed by Venezuelan media as 
'Maduro's sexy minister,' she looks set to be a focal point in the 
government formed by Hugo Chavez's successor.

The
 erotic photographs, published by Sunday magazine Dominical some five 
years ago, see her posing with nothing but her fencing equipment.

She joined other famous Venezuelans in getting naked for a series called: 'The Country Strips Down.'

'Clothes can hide anything,' she is quoted as saying in the magazine. 'But when you are naked, you are yourself.'

She released a portfolio of modelling shots in 2010.

'I want to inspire girls of the 
neighborhood, that the physical stereotype not only be seen as a sex 
symbol,' said Ben√≠tez in an interview.

'Beyond the physical beauty or sexual, I wanted 
to show an image of purity, feminine tenderness.'

Her official Facebook page is also awash with hundreds of suggestive pictures.

Benitez, a fully-trained dentist 
married to physical trainer Ricky Diez, will be in charge of providing 
financial support to sports projects across the country.

Maduro himself explained the 
appointment on state television by saying: 'In these processes of 
refreshment, renewal and re-invigoration, we considered it necessary to 
designate Alejandra Benitez, world medallist, Olympic competitor, as our
 new Minister of Sport.'

Born in Antimano, south of the capital
 Caracas, her ascent to the post of minister has been meteoric with her 
formal entry to politics only announced two years ago.

It has led older politicians to say, in 
private, that Maduro is 'doing a Berlusconi' by flanking himself with 
beautiful women in his cabinet.

The slur is in reference to former 
Italian Prime Minister Silvio who was often accused of hiring glamorous 
ministers solely because of their good looks.

Opposition politician Miguel Pizarro 
also believes Benitez is too inexperienced for the job, labelling her 'a
 very radical young woman who arrives at a very delicate time.'

But her followers suggest it is this 
radicalism, as a fervent vocal supporter of former President Chavez, 
that will ensure she makes a success of the role.

When competing she was labelled as 
'Chavez's champion' and he would reportedly call her with words of 
encouragement before major tournaments.

It led her to be one of a handful of 
elite sports stars performing a guard of honour for his coffin during 
his funeral. Others included Formula 1 driver Pastor Maldonado.

'Chavez believed in sport and was a 
sportsman,' she said in the days following his death. 'He was a special 
person that broke boundaries for us. He was the salvation of national 
sport.'.
