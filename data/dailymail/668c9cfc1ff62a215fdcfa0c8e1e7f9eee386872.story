Lucky escape: Finally after 20 minutes the boy is cut free, he reportedly only sustained a slight scratch to his tongue  

According to NewsFlare, which obtained the nerve-racking clip, the youngster stretched his tongue into the hole of a can while drinking and got it stuck inside.

The incident took place on New Year's Day.

His father apparently took him to a local hospital where doctors called firefighters for further assistance.

Firemen managed to clip the can into pieces with specialized equipment.

However, a dentist was required to perform more intricate cutting close to skin.

Indeed, footage shows a female technician using small clippers and files on the boy's mouth area.

Throughout the procedure the youngster appears awake, with bystanders holding him down in a bid to keep him calm and still.

Thanks to the team effort, the boy was freed after around 20 minutes.

He reportedly escaped with just a slight scratch to the tongue. It is not known what drink caused him to lap it up so enthusiastically.
