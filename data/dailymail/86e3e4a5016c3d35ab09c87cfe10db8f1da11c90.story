With more than a week until 50 Shades of Grey is released in cinemas, an astonishing 2.75 million tickets have already been sold worldwide.

But it isn't just cinemas who are hoping to make a killing from the film, which stars British talent Jamie Dornan, 32, as Christian Grey and up-and-coming star Dakota Johnson, 25, as the naive Anastasia Steele.

Companies selling everything from cakes to babygros are also hoping to cash in, as are firms flogging lingerie, sex toys and even cook books.

Terrifying: Among the many saleable tributes to Christian Grey is this edible 'homage' to Jamie Dornan

Coming soon: Ticket sales have already topped 2.75 million - with more than a week to go before the release

But while some errs on the side of tasteful, other products are less likely to have fans reaching for their wallets.

Among the strangest is a cake modelled on Dornan, which comes complete with a sugar towel and a brooding frown.

Part of a special 50 Shades of Cake collection at the Sugarcraft Cake Decorating Show in Manchester, liquorice whips, edible masks and sugar knickers are also available.

Just as bizarre is 50 Shades of Chicken, a cook book created by the brains behind parody Twitter account, 50 Sheds of Grey.

The book, which promises 'memorable tips' and 'revealing photographs', is purportedly written by F.L Fowler and includes such tempting recipes as 'Dripping Thighs' and 'Mustard Spanked Chicken'.

And it's by no means the only one. Other authors hoping to cash in include E.L James herself, who has given her seal of approval to a range of racy brown leather whips.

Spot the difference! The Jamie Dornan inspired cake bears a striking resemblance to ET

Homage: Dornan, pictured at the 50 Shades of Grey Fan First screening, is the inspiration for many a product

Racy: His cake incarnation boasts a towel, an impressive six-pack and an oddly sculpted face

Money spinner: The film, which stars Dornan and Dakota Johnson, is being jumped on by companies

The high-end range, made by upmarket lingerie brand Coco de Mer, includes whips, handcuffs, a flogger and even a mask, although with prices starting at £40, they don't come cheap.

James, who has made millions from her novels, has also endorsed another sex toy range, albeit a significantly cheaper version, made by erotic retailer LoveHoney.

She has also backed several lingerie collections, including a Christmas-themed 50 Shades of Grey range produced by supermarket Tesco.

But Tesco is not the only underwear seller to cash in on the phenomenon. Swedish label Kappa and kinky knicker shop Ann Summers have also produced collections, as has plus-size retailer J.D Williams.

The latter's efforts, which come bearing the slogan 'We're Over 50 Shades of Grey' is aimed at the 'mature' woman and features a mixture of lace pants and shape-wear.

Bizarre: One of the more unusual tributes is this cook book, entitled: 50 Shades of Chicken

Racy: Author E.L James has put her name to this expensive collection of brown leather sex toys

Expensive: Launched last week by Coco de Mer, it starts at £40 and includes leather handcuffs

Cheap and cheerful: James has also put her name to this low-cost LoveHoney range of sex toys

But while the deluge of underwear and sex toys will come as no surprise, other products aimed at 50 Shades of Grey fans just might.

Particularly toe-curling is the 50 Shades of Grey teddy bear which comes dressed in a Christian Grey inspired suit and carries a set of handcuffs.

According to makers The Vermont Teddy Bear Company, the $89.99 (£59) soft toy boasts 'smouldering' grey eyes and sports a 'satin' tie similar to that worn by Jamie Dornan in the film.

And the bear isn't the only child-friendly product to be given a 50 Shades makeover. Perhaps the most excruciating of all is the set of erotic novel inspired baby wear appearing on US website, Etsy.

Bearing such slogans as 'I'm a product of 50 Shades of Grey' and 'My Mommy Pretends Christian Grey is My Daddy', the ensembles are designed to cater for children aged between three months and a year.

Over 50 Shades: This lingerie collection is aimed at women over the age of 50 and includes lace pants

Risque: Naughty knicker shop Ann Summers has also leapt on the bandwagon with this racy collection

Tasteful: One of the more tasteful tributes is Bluebella's 'Black Label' collection, also inspired by the film

Strange: The Vermont Teddy Bear Company has created a £59 bear, once again inspired by Dornan

Men too can buy into the 50 Shades of Grey look, courtesy of a £24.99 silk tie sold as part of the 'official pleasure collection', which is sold through LoveHoney and also includes a £15 roll of bright red 'bondage tape'.

The film is also making its mark on women's wardrobes, with companies rushing out all-grey capsule collections, among them Spottedonceleb and Quilit.

It has even made inroads into travel and restaurants, with a 15 Shades of Bacon burger briefly offered by The Custom House in Barnstaple for £15.

Still available is the Fifty Shades of Gin cocktail currently served at the Rib Room in London's Knightsbridge, which combines 41 gins, including damson and sloe varieties, with seven types of fruit and Fever Tree Tonic Water.

Dressing the part: Spottedonceleb and Quilit are among the brands to pay tribute to 50 Shades of Grey

Tasty: The Rib Room in Knightsbridge has launched an 'alluring' £16 cocktail called 50 Shades of Gin

'I’m thrilled to introduce such an alluring cocktail,' quipped creator Michele Caggianese at the launch of the £16 drink:

'Created from British ingredients, [it is] served for pleasure. A labour of love, Fifty Shades of Gin is a unique cocktail to be savoured.'

But while £16 is affordable to most, fans with the cash to splash can travel to Seattle where the apartment used by Christian Grey in the film is available to rent.

The luxury apartment costs £171 per night to rent but was the setting from one of the film's most famous scenes, in which Anastasia wakes up in bed with Christian for the very first time. 

Also on offer for travelling fans is the 'No Grey Area' package offered by the Edgewater Hotel, also in Seattle, which costs £9,346 and includes use of an Audi R8 Spyder, a helicopter tour and a discreetly located copy of the Kama Sutra.

Expensive: One Seattle hotel is offering a £9,000 50 Shades package that includes a helicopter ride

No Grey: The Edgewater Hotel's deal also includes a discreet copy of the Kama Sutra and the use of an Audi
