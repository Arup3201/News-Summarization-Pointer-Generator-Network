The Special Forces marksman who is said to have told his wife that members of the SAS ‘arranged’ the death of Princess Diana faces a Ministry of Defence investigation amid claims he sent emails to his wife revealing sensitive details.

The marksman, known as Soldier N, is also said to have stored secret SAS tactical documents and videos of operations in Afghanistan.

In one email sent to his wife, Soldier N writes about an SAS mission in which a child was shot and an elderly woman hit by shrapnel.

In other emails written during  a tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2009 he describes – sometimes gleefully – how insurgents  are killed.

Elsewhere he mentions the names of colleagues and locations where the SAS and Special Boat Service are based.

One email discloses that the SAS were killing insurgents with missiles that had been fired from drones.

Crucially, Soldier N also reveals the dates when he and the rest of his unit were returning to  Britain on leave. In one message written in August 2009, Soldier N tells his wife: ‘We have arrived in Kandahar, the next  part is to get to Camp Bastion  but our plane broke so we’re staying here tonight with the  guys from Poole [the Special  Boat Service].

‘Don’t you worry about me.  You know that I shoot first, ask questions later.’

In another, written in the same month, he says: ‘We had a good morning today.

In emails written during  a tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2009 he describes - sometimes gleefully - how insurgents  are killed

‘1st we tracked a bad bomber but couldn’t get him but an hour later 2 more bastards took over from him and were up to badness so we keeeeelled them with a missile. They made like jam and spread themselves all over the place! tee hee. We are watching you and we have missiles!! A good start to  the day.’

Three months later, he writes: ‘The place I’m in now is quite alright, a bit like a massive villa in the mountains, no greenery though, it’s better than anywhere else I’ve been so far, the lads are all cool, the boss is well switched on but chilled, not like A Squadron boss who’s a total ******. I was glad the job went well last night, especially as I was Squadron Sergeant Major for it and we got a big player and a financier,  so all is well.’

Later that month Soldier N writes: ‘We were out last night,  so that’s probably why you  couldn’t sleep.‘It was a good job. We got  the bad man we were after and  a few others.

‘One kid got shot though and an old chick got fragged [injured  by shrapnel] but the bad guy and his oppo [colleague] were both sorted. Two less bastards.

‘I’m off to Kandahar tonight  for a planning meeting, then  the guys will follow in a  few days.

‘I should be able to keep in comms [communication] there.’
