Three men have been charged with slavery offences following an investigation at a travellers’ site.

Thomas Doran, Daniel Doran and David Daniel Doran are accused of false imprisonment, conspiracy to hold a person in servitude and conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.

The charges come after a third alleged victim was recovered from one of the sites being searched by detectives in South Wales.

Hunt: Police officers are pictured here on Monday as part of the operation

Large-scale: The investigation - called Operation Imperial - involves more than 150 officers

The CPS said Thomas Doran will also face an additional charge of kidnapping by fraud.

Catrin
 Evans, head of complex casework unit, CPS Wales, said: 'The Crown 
Prosecution Service has been working alongside Gwent Police as their 
investigations under Operation Imperial, an anti-slavery operation set 
up to investigate allegations of mistreatment, have progressed. In 
particular, we have been offering advice and guidance to the police 
since four suspects were arrested on Monday.

'I have now carried out a review of the evidence gathered by Gwent Police in relation to three of these suspects.

'My
 conclusion is that there is sufficient evidence to charge Thomas Doran,
 Daniel Doran and David Daniel Doran with false imprisonment, conspiracy
 to hold a person in servitude and conspiracy to require a person to 
perform forced or compulsory labour.

'In
 addition, there is sufficient evidence to charge Thomas Doran with 
kidnapping by fraud. In respect of each of these offences, I have also 
concluded that charges are in the public interest.

'Accordingly,
 I have authorised Gwent Police to charge the three defendants and they 
will appear before magistrates on Thursday.'

Officers earlier confirmed they went to an address in St Brides, Newport, and found a 60-year-old British man.

A Polish man was taken from a farm in nearby Peterstone, Newport, earlier this week.

Specialists: The hunt was launched after new intelligence on activities linked to slavery was found

Police presence: Four people were arrested on Monday in a dawn raid. Three more people have now been arrested.

Comprehensive: The hunt is part of a long-running investigation into the suspected slave gang

Earlier
 this year, a Kidderminster man was found at the same site in Peterstone
 after going missing 13 years ago while on holiday in the South Wales 
resort of Porthcawl.

Four other people have also been arrested as part of Operation Imperial.

Officers
 began their inquiries earlier in the year after a 'vulnerable' missing 
man was found living in poor conditions on Cariad Farm in Peterstone, 
which has been described in a Newport Council document as gypsy and 
traveller family-owned accommodation.

Darrell Simester, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, disappeared while on a holiday in Porthcawl 13 years ago.

The three men will appear at Cwmbran Magistrates’ Court tomorrow.
