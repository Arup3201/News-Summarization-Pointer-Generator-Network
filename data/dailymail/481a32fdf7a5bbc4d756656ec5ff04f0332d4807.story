Snopp Dogg said he blames President Ronald Reagan for the culture of gang violence that existed in parts of Los Angeles, California during the 1980s and beyond. 

Snoop, aka Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, brought the issue up after he took the stage in Austin, Texas, on Friday as South by Southwest Music's 2015 keynote speaker.

The 43-year-old said Reaganomics prompted a shift away from football and fun to guns and drugs.

Snoop was talking about an HBO show he is developing that will be about life on the West Coast during the 1980s.

The plot will center 'on a family whose seemingly idyllic life is turned upside down by the collision of their community and American politics', Deadline reported. 

The hip-hop legend said Reaganomics was 'designed' to make things tough in the inner-city, the Daily Beast reported. 

Snoop said: 'When Reaganomics kicked in, certain things were taken away, after-school programs and things of that nature. 

'Guns and drugs were shipped into the neighborhood. 

'So it was a shift of having fun and playing football to selling drugs and shooting at each other. 

'To me it was a system that was designed, because when the Reaganomics era began, that's when this began.'

He began his remarks by speaking about what life was like before the Reaganomics era began.

Snoop said: 'Early in the '70s and toward the latter part of the '70s everything was beautiful because we had ways to have fun and communicate, and those who were underprivileged, the low economic side of life, the government would provide for us, which helped us get by.

'It was a society and we all needed it and we all had it and we all helped each other.' 

Later on Friday, Snoop posted a Yakit video that was created of himself speaking to Reagan about the allegation on Instagram.
