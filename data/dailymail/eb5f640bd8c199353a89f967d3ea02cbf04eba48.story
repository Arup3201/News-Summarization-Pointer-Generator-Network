The housekeeper at the center of the Indian diplomat scandal today revealed her devastation on learning that her former boss has fled the U.S. and may escape prosecution.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Sangeeta Richard said: 'I stood up for my rights as a worker and I only wish that Defendant Khobragade would stand up in court and address the charges against her.'

She continued: 'I am so disappointed to learn that Defendant Khobragade has left the United States.'

Khobragade was charged by a federal grand jury in Manhattan with visa fraud and making false statements in a case that has triggered outcry both in the States and in India.

Exploited: Sangeeta Richard wants to see her former boss prosecuted in the U.S. and is bitterly disappointed that Devyani Khobragade was granted diplomatic immunity allowing her to leave the country last week

Devyani Khobragade was charged with visa fraud and making false statements. She faces prosecution if she returns to the States and has expressed her fear that she may never live with her husband and two daughters - who remain in New York - as family again.

The Indian consulate official left the country on Friday as she was granted full diplomatic immunity just hours after the charges were filed in court. 

On Sunday she spoke to the Indian press and revealed the 'immense stress' she had experienced on leaving her husband, a university academic, and daughters age seven and four in New York. They are all U.S. citizens.

Faced with prosecution should she return to the States, Khobragade said: 'I wonder if I will ever be able to reunite with my family, my husband, my little kids. I miss them.

'What if my children choose to study and work in the U.S.? What if I can never return to the U.S? Does it mean we will never be able to live together as a family again?'

Judge Shira Scheindlin granted Khobragade permission to leave the country at a hearing in Manhattan federal court last Thursday.

Speaking at the time her lawyer Daniel Arshack said, 'She is pleased to be returning to her 
country. Her head is held high. She knows 
she has done no wrong.'

But in her own impassioned statement to MailOnline her former housekeeper Richard revealed her bitter disappointment at the turn of events.

She told of her desire to serve as as inspiration to others and revealed how her own desire to return to India had been denied.

Devyani Khobragade was arrested last 
month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her 
housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour

She said: ‘I would like to tell other domestic 
workers who are suffering as I did – you have rights and do not let 
anyone exploit you.'

She also told of the hopes with which she had arrived in the country in the first place.

‘When I decided to come to the United States my hope was to work 
for a few years to support my family and then return to India,' said Richard.

‘I 
never thought that things would get so bad here, that I would work so 
much that I did not have time to sleep or eat or have time to myself.

‘Because of this treatment, I requested that I return to India but that request was denied.’

She went on: ‘I would like to express my appreciation to everyone who has supported me through this process.’

Richard
 has been supported by Safe Horizon, a victim support agency that 
promotes justice for victims of crime and abuse in many forms including 
human trafficking.

Avaloy Lanning, Senior 
Director of the Anti-Trafficking Program at Safe Horizon applauded the 
steps taken by the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New 
York for indicting Khobragade on charges of visa fraud and making 
false statements in connection with Richard.

She welcomed the move as a demonstration of how seriously the U.S. government treats labor exploitation.

She
 said: ‘I hope this case sends a clear message to diplomats and consular
 officials that the U.S. will not tolerate the exploitation of workers and
 marks the beginning of an increase in prosecution of these cases.’

According to Safe Horizon, Richard's is not an isolated case but one that is ‘tragically common.’

Devyani Khobragade was accused of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her New York City housekeeper.

The
grand jury indictment said Khobragade had made multiple false representations 
to U.S. authorities, or caused them to be made, to obtain a visa for a 
personal domestic worker.

She planned to bring the worker to the 
United States in September 2012 when she worked at the Consulate General
 of India in New York, according to the indictment.

But in a letter to the judge, prosecutors said there was no need for an 
arraignment because Khobragade had 'very recently' been given diplomatic
 immunity status and left the United States on Thursday.

The
 letter said the charges will remain pending until she can be brought to
 court to face them, either through a waiver of immunity or her return 
to the U.S. without immunity status.

'We
 will alert the court promptly if we learn that the defendant returns to
 the United States in a non-immune capacity, at which time the 
government will proceed to prosecute this case and prove the charges in 
the indictment,' the letter from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet 
Bharara said.

Khobragade has maintained her 
innocence to the accusations that she claimed to pay her Indian maid $4,500 
per month but actually gave her far less than the U.S. minimum wage.

Her
 arrest last month sparked outrage in India after revelations that she 
was strip-searched and thrown in a cell with other criminal defendants 
before being released on $250,000 bail.

In an 
unusual statement last month, U.S. Attorney Bharara responded to 
what he described as misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the case 
by saying Khobragade was accused of creating false documents and lying 
to the U.S. government about what she was doing, including hiring a 
housekeeper who was working far more than the 40 hours per week she was 
contracted to work.

He also 
questioned why there was ‘precious little outrage’ about the treatment 
of the Indian housekeeper and her husband while there was so much about 
the alleged treatment of Khobragade.

He
 said his office's sole motivation was to uphold the law, protect 
victims and hold lawbreakers accountable, ‘no matter what their societal
 status and no matter how powerful, rich or connected they are'.

These
 developments came as it was revealed that a lawsuit filed months ago on 
behalf of the housekeeper alleged poor working conditions.

Philip Richard, Ms Richard's husband, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in 
July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. 

Mr Richard also said the consular 
official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family 
saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug 
charges.

In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com,
 a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani 
Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions 
or keeping a person in bondage.'

The
 petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family 
several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire 
consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get 
them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.'

Mr
 Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in 
front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of 
what the woman took.

Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also 
wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and 
wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go.

Mr Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, 
because the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on 
foreign soil'.
