Berlin wants to send German inspectors to Greece to ensure all taxes that are due are collected.

The controversial move will see a 'foreign legion' of 160 or so taxmen head south to try and root out corruption and make sure national coffers are filled in a country where revenue evasion is an art form.

Finance department secretary of state Hans Bernhard Beus announced his plan to the WirtschaftsWoche business magazine.

It comes just weeks after Europe rejected a German move for a financial 'gauleiter' to oversee all of Greece's books in a bid to avert financial meltdown.

But in order to receive billions in bailout funds, Greece has had to agree to fire dozens of underperforming tax inspectors in the coming months.

Germany believes its beancounters will be able to drive out in excess of £50billion, either hidden under mattresses or in secret accounts, into the clear light of day and then into state coffers.

Last week, European leaders finally agreed a fresh bailout for Greece, worth £108billion.

Call: George Osborne says IMF should not fund another eurozone bailout

But concern remains throughout Europe that Athens will not be able to meet strict conditions attached.

Greece views such an offer as 'humiliating' and believes it to be one more attempt by Germany to take control of the nation piece by piece.

Beus' description of his tax squad as 'volunteers' is meant to reduce the tensions between the two countries.

Another finance official, Thomas Schaefer of the state of Hesse, said he was looking at calling up a 'dad's army' of retired tax officials to move into Greece to help find the estimated £15 to 20bn in annual undeclared income.

'It would be possible to mobilise such people with large practical experience quite easily,' he said.

The German demand comes as Britain and the world's other leading economies in the IMF said they should not be forced to fund another eurozone bailout.

Speaking
as finance ministers gather in Mexico for the G20 summit, the 
Chancellor said extra funds would not be handed over until countries who
use the struggling single currency commit resources themselves.

In
an interview with Sky News, Mr Osborne said: 'We are prepared to 
consider IMF resources but only once we see colour of eurozone money and
we have not seen this.

'While at this G20 conference there 
are a lot of things to discuss, I don’t think you’re going to see any 
extra resources committed here because eurozone countries have not 
committed additional resources themselves, and I think that quid pro quo
will be clearly established here in Mexico City.'
