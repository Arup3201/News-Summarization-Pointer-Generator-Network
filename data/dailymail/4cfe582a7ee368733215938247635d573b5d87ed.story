Art lover: Actor Federico Castelluccio, best known for his role as a hitman on The Sopranos, has come upon a long-lost Italian masterpiece

Actor Federico Castelluccio, best known for his role as a hitman on The Sopranos, has come upon a long-lost Italian masterpiece while looking to expand his art collection.

Few people know that besides being a thespian, Castelluccio, 50, is also a connoisseur of Baroque European art and a gifted realist painter in his own right.

A few years ago, The Sopranos star discovered a canvass at an art dealer in Frankfurt, Germany, mistakenly labelled as an 18th century religious painting of Saint Sebastian by an unknown Italian artist.

Castelluccio, a native of Naples, bought the painting at an auction and hired art experts who attributed the work to the Baroque master Guercino, painted sometime between 1632 and 1634.

The painting, rendered in somber hues and featuring striking chiaroscuro - an effect of contrasted light and shadow - depicts a traditional image of early Christian martyr Saint Sebastian tied to a tree and pierced with arrows.

The complex process of authentication involved infrared reflectology, chemical testing of the pigment used by the famed Bolognese artist and X-rays, reported the New York Post.

Castelluccio spent several years - and an estimated $140,000 - meticulously restoring the artwork, which could be worth millions of dollars at an auction.

The Guercino will now go on display for the first time in more than three centuries as part of an exhibit hosted by the Cosso Foundation and the Miradolo Castle in Turin, Italy, beginning October 4.

The actor is also planning to write a book about his priceless acquisition that had been languishing in Frankfurt until he came along.

The book, which is currently at proposal stage, will also tell the story of how Castelluccio, who emigrated from Italy in 1968 with his family, developed a passion for art growing up in Paterson, New Jersey.

Catelluccio graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York City with a bachelor's degree in painting and visual arts.

He began his career as an actor in the 1980s, but his big break came in 1991 when he appeared in Diary of a Hitman.

His other credits include Made starring Jon Favreau and the more recent A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints opposite Robert Downy Jr.

Hidden talents: Few people know that the actor is also a painter and a serious art collector. The 50-year-old spent several years and an estimated $140,000 restoring the 350-year-old Baroque artwork

From 2000-2002, Castelluccio appeared on the highly acclaimed HBO series The Sopranos playing Furio Giunta, a Sicilian gun-for-hire working for Tony Soprano, portrayed by James Gandolfini. 

Since then he has appeared in several of shorts, and he is currently attached to four new projects in pre- and post-production.

Frederico Castelluccio also has made a name for himself as a serious artist who has exhibited his works, influenced by Renaissance and Baroque masters, in galleries from New York City to New Mexico.
