With two children, a devoted best friend, a loving boyfriend and a comfortable home, life for Steph Cocker, 24, from Sheffield, is good.

But all is not quite as it seems for Steph's idyllic lifestyle is funded by benefits of £330 a week, while boyfriend Nathan, recently released from prison, lives next door so Steph can go on claiming an extra allowance for being a single parent.

Yet far from being ashamed of her taxpayer-funded lifestyle, the 24-year-old describes her life as 'blessed' and says she won't stop claiming until she finds a job that pays her £5,000 a month.

Enjoying life: Mother-of-two Steph Cocker, 24, says she is as 'happy as Larry' with her taxpayer-funded life

'I've had my life cushty,' she boasts. 'I have had 
everything provided for me. If I wanted it, I got it. Still now. If I 
want it, I'll get it.

'From being young, I've had everything I ever 
wanted. If I wanted a Barbie, I'd f***ing get it. I'm not f***ing 
getting off of benefits. That is just as simple as that.'

And while Steph, who appears on Channel 5 documentary Benefits Britain: Life on the Dole, says she'd do any job, it would have to pay at least £5,000 a month.

'I'd do anything for a job - even if its 
making cups of tea,' she insists. 'If I were earning enough, I'd go to that job.

'But to
 put my kids in childcare from 9 to 5, it's £400 a week. I'd need to be 
on at least £5,000 a month to pay my rent, to pay my council tax, 
everything like that.'

Paid for: Steph, seen here getting a new tattoo, is paid £330 a week  and says she has no plans to find a job

Her hometown, Sheffield, is one of the most deprived parts of the UK, with 80,000 people currently out of work and dependent on the dole, which last year cost taxpayers £117bn, to survive.

But while Steph is adamant about staying on benefits, her best friend Zara Suki, 20, couldn't be more different.

'I hate being on benefits, I hate going 
to the job centre, I hate not working,' she says. 'That's the main thing I hate - 
not working. I want to do something, get out there, get a good routine 
in my life.'

Unfortunately for Zara, a criminal record and a stint in prison aged 17 have made getting work difficult to say the least.

'It's like, I went for an interview for a job at McDonalds. I did 
well in my interview and I've got previous experience in similar jobs like 
that.

'The only thing that let me down is my criminal record. When I 
was younger, I used to take part in a lot of robberies just for a way to
 make money.

Different world: Steph's friend Zara, right, is desperate to get a job so she can win her son back

'I haven't lived with my mum and dad since I was young, so I 
was independent from a young age. I used to go out fighting a lot, 
carrying knives with you... Just stupid things.'

For now, she and her Staffordshire bull terrier, Giro, spend their lives helping Steph take care of her two sons, Corbin Jay, three, and Cohen Kenzie, one.

She even cares for the two boys while Steph indulges in one of her favourite pastimes - getting new tattoos, which she does whenever she has cash to spare.

'It's my money what I got for my 
birthday and I can do what I want with it,' says a mulish Steph as she contemplates the 'flowers and fairies' that she wants to add to her already large sleeve artwork.

'Obviously, if I didn't get
 benefits, I'd be spending it on food and stuff like that but 
since it's my money, I can do what I want with it. If I want to go and 
piss it up the wall, I will.'

Tough times: 80,000 people in Steph's hometown Sheffield are currently out of work and on benefits

No job: Unlike Zara, Steph doesn't have to find a job because her children are under five

Zara, who lives on £70 a week, also has a son but he was taken away by social services aged three months - much to her continuing dismay.

'I was 17 when I went to prison,' she explains. 'About 
four weeks before, I found out I was pregnant.

'It's not nice having 
scans when you're in f***ing handcuffs. I'm not really an emotional 
person but when it comes to my son, I am.

'If I had a job, it would make it much 
easier to see my son and take steps towards getting him back. It
 breaks my heart when I have to leave him.

'I took him bowling the other 
day but I don't get to see him very often. People think, "Oh, she's a 
criminal, don't give her a job", but if people knew me how I am now from 
how I used to be, they'd see I've grown up a lot and changed a lot. I'm 
just a totally different person.'

Steph, however, has no such worries. 'I'm happy as Larry,' she boasts. 'As long as I've got 
my kids and my family, people can come and go as they like and I'm not 
bothered.

'There's worse things in the world than my situation. Life's 
blessed for me right now.'
