She might have been spending the day in the mountains but that certainly didn't mean letting her sartorial standards slip.

Spain's Queen Letizia was with her husband King Felipe and two adorable daughters and managed to look every inch the yummy mummy in a pair of casual chinos and a pretty printed T-shirt.

The royal couple and their daughters are currently on their annual holiday to the Balearic party isle, and have been spending much of their time relaxing in the Marivent Palace just outside capital Palma.

While the infamous resort of Magaluf is less than 12 miles away, royal holidays on the Spanish party island of Mallorca tend to be more sedate.

Instead of lines of jager bombs and drunken fumbles on balconies, the Spanish royals spend most of the time on their yacht, Fortuna, and the rest enjoying private dinners interspersed with the occasional official visit.

But there's more to Mallorca than relaxing on yachts and avoiding Magaluf as the royal couple and their daughters discovered this morning.

The striking Serra de Tramuntana were recently declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in recognition of the extraordinary agricultural techniques used on its precipitously steep slopes, and the royals began their day with a visit to the newly opened visitor centre in Bunyola.

Afterwards, the quartet were taken to see something of the mountains themselves before enjoying a lunch at a pretty country house in Raixa.

Afterwards, the family returned to the Marvient Palace to continue their holiday, which is expected to continue for another week.

Like the Queen, whose annual trip to Balmoral combines family time with official visits, the Spanish royals spend part of their holiday meeting well-wishers and conducting engagements.

Unlike the British monarch, however, the Spanish royals rarely host visiting heads of state at the Marvient, although some well-heeled visitors do get to see inside.

One
 group of visitors who did were the Prince 
of Wales and the late Princess Diana, who joined the Spanish royals for a
 holiday in Mallorca in 1988.Â 

Like Queen Letizia and King Felipe who posed for photos on the steps of the palace on the day they arrived, the British royal couple joined former King Juan-Carlos and his wife Queen Sophia for pictures along with their children - a three-year-old Prince Harry and a five-year-old William.

The British royals also spent time on Fortuna, with Prince Charles photographed teaching Harry how to swim under the watchful gaze of fellow guest, King Constantine of Greece.
