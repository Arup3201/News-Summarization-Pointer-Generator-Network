The White House said the U.S. was not considering arming rebels in Syria but that no option would be completely ruled out as the Obama administration struggled to find a way to quell violence and end the bloodshed.

Eighteen premature babies were reportedly among dozens of civilians who died yesterday in one of the bloodiest days 
of the Syrian uprising centered on the rebel-held city of Homs. 

At the State Department, spokesman 
Victoria Nuland said that while the U.S. never takes any option off the 
table, 'we don't think more arms into Syria is the answer'.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said 
current deliberations inside the administration were focused on how the 
U.S. could provide humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, though he 
wouldn't say what form such assistance might take.

High price: The number of civilian casualties is rising in Syria as the violence escalates prompting calls for a stronger military response from the U.S.

However a preliminary review of U.S. military readiness was reportedly in hand. A senior U.S. official told CNN: 'The Pentagon is closely monitoring developments in Syria... but absolutely no decisions have been made on military support for Syria.'

More than 5,400 people have been killed 
in the country since the uprising against President Bashar 
Assad's regime began in March, 
according to a United Nations toll last month. Hundreds more
are believed to have been killed since then, but the UN says the 
chaos in the country has made it impossible to cross-check the figures.

Earlier on Tuesday, some congressional 
lawmakers, including Republican Senator John McCain, called for the 
country to explore the prospect of arming opposition forces in Syria.

Senator McCain said: 'We should start considering options, arming the opposition. The bloodletting has got to stop.'

McCain was a staunch advocate last year 
for the U.S. to arm rebels in Libya in their fight against Muammar Gaddafi
and forces loyal to his regime. The U.S. and NATO did ultimately provide 
military help under the cover of a UN mandate.

Western powers have met repeatedly with 
members of Syria's emerging political opposition, but they are wary of 
engaging closely with would-be rebel forces without the legal protection
of a similar UN resolution.

But in the wake of last weekend's defeat
of a Security Council resolution calling for Assad to step down, western nations have little appetite for another run
at the UN.

While the double-veto by Russia and 
China at the Security Council Saturday put diplomatic efforts at an 
impasse, the White House says it is still loath to consider a military 
option.

President Barack Obama responded at the weekend on questions as to why the U.S. engaged militarily in Libya, but not in Syria.

The President said: 'Not every situation is going to allow for the kind of military solution we saw with Libya. I think it is very possible for us to try to resolve this without recourse to outside military intervention.'

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called for 'friends of democratic Syria' to unite and rally against Assad's regime, previewing the possible formation of a group of like-minded nations to coordinate assistance to the Syrian opposition.

Speaking in Bulgaria on Sunday, she said the world had a duty to halt the violence and see Assad out of power.

Despite
the continued violence, the White House insists that sanctions and 
diplomatic pressure are taking a toll on Assad's regime.

'Ultimately
it needs to result in Assad ceasing the violence, stopping the 
brutality and allowing for a transition supported by the Syrian people,'
White House spokesman Carney added.

The
bloodshed came as reports emerged that 18 premature babies perished 
yesterday after their incubators failed during power cuts in the 
rebel-held city of Homs.

Government militiamen also killed 19 people from three families in the besieged city after storming homes.

Although there was no official 
confirmation of the babies’ deaths in Homs, activist Mohammad Hassan 
confirmed that power had gone down during the terrifying onslaught by 
government forces.

‘We counted 47 killed since midnight,’ he said.

Russian Minister Sergey Lavrov (left) said he had received assurances from Bashar al-Assad that he was 'completely committed to the task of stopping violence' wherever it may come from

A top commander of the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force has arrived in Syria to help 
Assad manage the uprising, a member of the National Syrian Council has 
claimed.

Kassam Salimani has reportedly taken
up a spot in the Syrian war room, allegedly including Assad himself, 
which manages army manoeuvres against opposition forces.

The Quds Force specialises in 
unconventional warfare on foreign soil - indicating what kind of battle 
Assad wants to bring to his tormentors, haaretz.com said.

The 15,000 elite soldiers that make up the force are in charge of training and funding Hezbollah.

Bombardment intensified in the early 
morning, he added, targeting Sunni Muslim districts all hostile to 
Assad, whose minority Alawite sect has dominated Syria for five decades.

A group known as the Syrian Revolution
General Commission put the day’s death toll even higher, at 100. Syrian
state television blamed explosions on Homs militants.

It accused 
‘terrorists’ of targeting a refinery in the city with mortars, while 
activists blamed the army for a fire filmed by residents.   

Another activist said security forces 
had captured a hospital, jailing the injured.

The last field hospital in
Baba Amr was bombed on Monday, he said, adding: ‘We lost ten people 
when we tried to evacuate it.

‘We are using kitchen knives for 
surgery. We don’t have any blood for donations, or oxygen. We are 
calling on help from the whole world.’

The U.S. has closed its embassy while five European countries and six Arab 
Gulf nations have pulled their ambassadors out of Damascus.

The UN estimates the government crackdown has killed more than 5,400 people since March.

Last night Syrian army tanks were said to be entering Homs to wipe out any last resistance.
