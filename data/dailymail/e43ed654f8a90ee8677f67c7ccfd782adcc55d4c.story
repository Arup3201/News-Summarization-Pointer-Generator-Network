Kevin Nolan insists that he didn't hear any boos from West Ham supporters when he came on during their 2-0 win at home to QPR before the international break.

The midfielder, who is captain at the club, was brought on with just over 15 minutes to go in the game, and sections of the Hammers support appeared to voice their displeasure at his introduction.

But, despite being informed of the booing by his brother and father who were in the stands, Nolan told the Evening Standard it was just a minority of supporters and also defended his career record - which includes 17 goals in 56 Premier League games for West Ham. 

Kevin Nolan insists he didn't hear boos after coming on for West Ham against QPR

The midfielder and club captain has an impressive goalscoring record for the Hammers

‘When I went on I had instructions from the gaffer and I needed to organise things. My dad and brother heard it, though, and they told me afterwards,’ he said.

‘At the end of the day, if people want to boo men, that’s up to them. I don’t look at websites so I don’t read any of it but people have told me that many fans were not happy with the negative reaction and I do appreciate that.

‘I’ve had a great playing career and, I know, if you ask most Bolton fans now who they would like to come back and lead them, I would be up there near the top. The same for Newcastle fans.

‘I’m part of a fantastic squad, I’m trying to do my best, I always will. I will know when it’s time for me to go, or the gaffer or the chairman will. Until then, I will continue to give 100 per cent.

‘They [the boo boys] won’t get a reaction out of me — they might do out of my dad, though, because he wasn’t happy. To me, though, it was nothing because I know it wasn’t deserved.

‘I know the negative supporter always shouts louder than the masses who are there to support their team.’

West Ham currently sit seventh in the Premier League, after collecting 10 points in the first seven games of the season. They travel to face winless Burnley on Saturday.
