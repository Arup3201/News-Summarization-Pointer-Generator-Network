Race days across the world are renowned for being glamorous occasions that offer a chance to dress up to the nines... but there are always a few people who don't get the memo.

And so it was at this year's Melbourne Cup, where one or two racegoers were perhaps a bit too keen to let their hair down and flash the flesh.

Around 110,000 people were dressed to impress - and up for a drink.

Big day out: Racegoers rest on the steps at the end of Melbourne Cup Day at Flemington Racecourse

Occassion: This merrymaker sings as she clutches a bottle in one pink-and-green-nailed hand, heels in the other

Fashion parade: One lady bares all in a skin-tight gold dress; another shows off her tattoos in a backless dress

Conked out: A racegoer relaxes on the floor amidst the celebrations by two men standing with champagne

In time-honoured fashion, the racegoers at Flemington became gradually more dishelleved, skulling champagne as they cheered their horses through the two-mile contest.

British racing events have long had a reputation for getting a bit messy as the day develops, but the hedonistic Melbourne crowds showed the UK that they can party just as hard.

Both winners and losers made the most of the hospitality on offer and caused havoc around the racecourse.

Embrace: A couple clutch each other and their drinks towards the end of the event

Happiness: One of the 110,000-strong crowd lies back and beams at the sun amidst plastic cups on the lawn

Pride: A poem was broadcast about the race that says 'We Aussies are a funny lot, the things we hold so dear - like Rosewell, Hoad, The Opera House... A glass of Fosters beer'

Funky chicken: In fascinators and formal dresses, these women display their party moves for the thousands

Debauched: Two friends covered in cake jump on top of each other in time-honoured tradition

Before long, women were kicking their elegant heels off and donning silly hats, can of Fosters in hand.

Others were seen being carried half-conscious.

While some dance the limbo, one
lady can be seen crawling onto the floor, while another wraps herself 
around her date passionately in the middle of the worn and torn field.

And in a bid to win one of the fashion prizes awarded to men and women, the attendees doll themselves up in glitter, bright colours, low-cut dresses, and elaborate high heels.

Fashion has long been a central focus of the event - the mini skirt has one of its first major platforms at the cup's Derby Day in 1965 when Jean Shrimpton attended and debuted her invention.

Party: These pictures wouldn't be out of place in a festival album - save the formalwear

Holding on: This group hold onto each other as they decide on their route out of the rubbish-strewn arena

Going...: One reveller crawls over to the ground with her sunglasses falling off her face

Going...: She topples but offers a grin in the spirit of the occassion, the highlight of Melbourne's spring carnival

Gone...: She drops her face to the ground kicking her bare feet in the air with glee at the end of a long day

Flying high: She's back up again to celebrate (left), while one bet winner (right) leaps into his friends arms

Time out: One man gathers the strength to go on partying in a mid-race time out

It is a far cry from the scenes in 
West Berkshire, where even a hint of dresses creeping over the knee has 
you barred from the event entirely.

This year the Damien Oliver took the title racing Australian-trained Fiorente.

It meant two British-trained horses - Red Cadeaux and Mount Athos - were pushed into second and third place.

Glitz and glamour: Hems graze bottoms in the racecourse fashion trend worlds away from England's

Far cry from Ascot: People in Berkshire have a strict dress code but in Australia they embrace fancy dress

Dramatic: Women come clad in elaborate gold, spiky high heels in a bid to win the fashion prize

Pink ladies: These women themed their day as they arrive in matching wigs and glasses for the event

Ecstatic: Two people throw bottles, jump and scream as they enjoy the party atmosphere

Mess: At the end, the public lawn is strewn with litter, people and birds looking for leftover food and drink

The Melbourne Cup is one of the richest flat races in the world with a total prize money pot of around £4 million.

Branded as the race that stops a nation, it has attracted riders, owners and horses from across the globe for decades.

It started in 1861, won by a horse named Archer. 

In 1877, the day was made a public holiday for Australia and New Zealand.

Carnival: The attendees limbo during the annual event, branded as 'the race that stops a nation'

Time of their lives: This woman grins as she inches towards the limbo pole with a champagne glass in her hand

Queens carriage: One stiletto-clad lady gets some help making her way across the grass from two men

Playing around: One girl squeals as a group of lads lift her up in a thigh-grazing, skin-tight dress

In 1986, an Australian radio programme broadcast a poem, The Race That Stops A Nation, which celebrated the debauched affair.

It says: 'We Aussies are a funny lot, the things we hold so dear - like Rosewall, Hoad, the Opera House, a glass of Fosters beer.'

Last year, the trophy was presented by the Duchess of Cornwall, who said it was a 'treat' for her and the Prince of Wales to sit in the stands and watch some of the world’s best jockeys compete.

The race: Photographers gather from around the world for the race, which is an annual highlight for the sport

Camilla clearly enjoyed her day at the races during her first visit to Australia and even had a flutter on one of the favourites, Mount Athos, according to Ms Elliott.

She met the horse’s British rider Ryan Moore, a three-times champion jockey, in the weighing room and also in the field was Frankie Dettori who rode Cavalryman.
