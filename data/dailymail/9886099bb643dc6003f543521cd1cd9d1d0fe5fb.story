While silence isn't usually associated with a football match, a junior club has become the first in Australia to enforce a silent sidelines policy.

That means no cheering, no talking and absolutely no abusive comments.

The Gap Football Club, in Brisbane, is the first to introduce the rule in a bid to improve sideline behaviour by spectators, mainly parents.

The Greater Brisbane Junior Rugby League also warned that misbehaving parents on the sidelines will be shamed by having their children eliminated from the game.

But GBJRL president Shane McNally told the Courier Mail they have not yet suspended any players.

'When it comes to kids' sport, it tends to get a bit emotional,' said Mr McNally.

'Being a parent, you want the best for your kids and if you think your kids are getting a raw deal or they're not getting a fair go, well, sometimes emotions get the better of people.'

While the GBJRL issued a timely reminder about their 'be positive or be quiet' policy, The Gap Football Club - which was established nearly 60 years ago - have opted for a tougher preventative measure.

Gerry McAvoy, the club's technical director, said majority have shown support for the new rule while others thought their freedom of speech was being withheld.

'I've had two people who didnâ€™t agree with it, who said "We feel that you're gagging us",' Mr McAvoy told Courier Mail.

This follows a series of sideline brawls and fist-throwing parents aiming their anger at match officials during junior sports games.
