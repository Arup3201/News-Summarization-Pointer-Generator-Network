Hyundai is recalling every ix35 made in the past three years due to safety concerns.

The vehicle is the most sold small SUV in Australia and the South Korean car manufacturer issued the recall for 32,525 vehicles built between Januaray 2011 and December 2013 because the airbag in the steering wheel may not be secured properly and also because the horn may not work.

This is the second recall for the ix35 this year and part of a global recall totaling more than 137,500 Hyundai vehicles, as announced last week, reported The Advertiser.

Hyundai is recalling every ix35 made in the past three years due to safety concerns relating to the airbag in the steering wheel and the horn

'An incorrectly tightened bolt could result in the misalignment of the airbag module, possibly affecting its deployment, and could also affect the operation of the horn,' a Hyundai Australia statement about the safety issue reads.

'It will not cause the airbag to deploy unintentionally,' it continues. '(But) the effectiveness of the airbag could be reduced if the bolt is not tightened properly.'

Despite this, the car marker said there have been no reported incidents in Australia but customers may notice a rattle in the steering wheel.

Hyundai said during preliminary inspections only four vehicles have needed to have their airbag bolts tightened.

A safety bulletin published on recalls.gov.au states Hyundai customers will be sent to letters requesting they return the vehicle to the nearest Hyundai dealership to have the driverâ€™s airbag module bolts inspected and tensioned to specification free of charge.

Hyundai has concerns the airbag in the steering wheel may not be secured properly

In April 2013, Hyundai recalled 227,000 cars so a faulty brake light switch that affected eight models could be fixed by dealers.

The Hyundai ix35 recall is the 33rd this year, including ones from makers car makers Aston Martin.

Hyundai recalled 6,193 ix35 SUVs in January because of a potentially faulty seatbelt pre-tensioner.

In the car manufacturer's foundation years, Hyundai refused to recall vehicles despite the front suspension assembly of 46 Hyundai Excel cars collapsing while in use in 1998.

This year's biggest recall was by Toyota in April, which saw close to 300,000 vehicles affected.

Of these were 179,000 HiLux utes were recalled due to a potential airbag failure and 118,600 Yarsis model cars because the seats could slide forwards.
