These filthy lodgings are rooms in the 'Homeless Hotel' - an initiative started in Sweden to raise funds for people without a home to go to.

Visitors can 'book a room' in one of ten places where homeless sleep in Gothenburg.

New concept: These filthy lodgings are rooms in the 'Homeless Hotel' - an initiative started in Sweden to raise funds for people without a home to go

Hotel with a difference: Visitors can 'book a room' in one of ten places where homeless sleep in Gothenburg

Choice: Options include a soiled sleeping bag in a park, a pile of dirty newspapers under a tramline, a frigid park bench or a dirty blanket underneath a football stadium

The conditions are deplorable so unsurprisingly most people opt not to stay in the allotted places - and all the money goes to help the homeless and disadvantaged.

The program was formed by Faktum, a magazine sold by homeless people in Sweden, in collaboration with the ad agency Forsman & Bodenfors.

'We don't think politicians do enough to help. This is a reminder of poverty and an easy way to get involved,' said Faktum editor-in-chief, Aaron Israelson.

Gothenburg, Sweden's second largest city, has about 3,400 homeless people, who are either sleeping rough or in temporary shelters.

'We chose ten of the places homeless people spend the night - and made it possible for you to book them. Just like any hotel,' said Faktum Hotel Designer Christoffer Persson.

Descriptions of the unpleasant sleeping locations are laid out on the site - such as this one for a soggy mattress on the concrete floor of an abandoned paper mill.

'The wheels of the mill may no longer turn but the lullaby of the Mölnda River may still be heard. Representing a chapter of Swedish industrial history Mölndal Mill is a unique residence. No more than a stone's throw from the city's communications hub.'
