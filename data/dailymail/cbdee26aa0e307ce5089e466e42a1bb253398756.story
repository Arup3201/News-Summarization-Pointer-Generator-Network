In the end,
 after 120 minutes, there were broken hearts and sweat-stained shirts 
hiding the heads of Algeria’s players. They were awesome.

Algeria
 didn’t deserve to go out of the World Cup in the second round after 
this staggering performance at the Estadio Beira-Rio.

If
 this is how Germany want to win a fourth World Cup then they can only 
hope to stumble across the finish line in Rio de Janeiro on July 13.

Joachim Low has a lucky, lucky team.

The world’s second-best side were taken to extra-time, stretched to their limits by their powerful,  muscular, resourceful African opponents. Eventually Algeria were undone by Andre Schurrle’s  92nd-minute strike, picked off by the experience and know-how of some of Germany’s finest players. That was the difference between them.

Sure, Mesut Ozil scored  Germany’s second and there was a late rally when substitute Abdelmoumene Djabou crashed a left-foot volley beyond Manuel Neuer. The real story was elsewhere.

Without the security provided by Neuer, Germany would be out of the World Cup. Surely now he is the best goalkeeper of them all.

At times he played sweeper, racing off his line to deny the  exuberant Islam Slimani when he scooted past Germany’s defence. France are next up for Germany in the Maracana and yet we could so easily have been speaking of Algeria.

They ran them so, so close.

Germany’s Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker hit back at criticism of his team’s performance.

‘Would you rather we played beautiful football but got knocked out?’ he snapped, visibly upset at the harsh tone of questioning by the German media after the match.

‘I don’t know what you want from me — do
 you think that just Mickey Mouse teams are involved in the last 16? All
 that matters is we’re in the quarter-finals.’

Schurrle echoed his 
view, saying: ‘Algeria did a really good job. But it doesn’t matter how 
we’ve done it, the main thing is we’re in the quarter-finals. There was a
 bit of luck involved in my goal and we’ve got to play better against 
France.’

There is a nagging suspicion that Germany are playing 
tournament football, with Low’s team keeping their opponents at arm’s 
length as they prepare for the latter stages. 

Algeria, by contrast 
were focused at the back and electrifying on the break. Their fans made 
quite a racket, pulling on green and white head gear and waving national
 flags as they created enough of a din to drown out Germany’s 
supporters.

Blast: Germany coach Joachim Low dismissed criticism of his tactics

After escaping a group including Belgium, Russia and 
South Korea, Vahid Halilhodzic’s team had every right to play with 
aggression. It was compelling viewing.

They ran like men possessed, 
spiriting the ball away from Toni Kroos, Philipp Lahm and Ozil in the 
centre of Germany’s midfield during a commanding first-half spell.

They
 had threats going forward, with Faouzi Ghoulam cutting his way through 
Germany’s defence with his raking passes up the line. Every time Algeria
 threatened, that man Ghoulam was providing the impetus from left back.

Germany
 possess some of the  finest ball players in the world and yet there 
were times when they were lazy and casual in the centre of the pitch.

Kroos,
 outstanding for Germany in their 1-0 win over England at Wembley last 
November, looked sluggish alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger. Eventually, 
Schweinsteiger succumbed to exhaustion.

Where were the cute little 
balls from Kroos around the corner to Ozil or Schweinsteiger that we  
usually drool over? Germany are in need of a re-think, particularly with
 Real Madrid’s Sami Khedira, Julian Draxler and Schurrle itching to 
start.

Schweinsteiger was forced off in extra-time, substituted 
because his tired legs could take no more. It has been a difficult 
season for him. The call for Schurrle came at the break when Mario 
Gotze was replaced by the Chelsea forward. Ozil switched to the left and
 suddenly it all made sense. Kroos provided cross for Shkodran Mustafi 
to tower above the Algeria defence and yet the outstanding Rais M’Bolhi 
refused to be beaten. He was immense.

The Algeria keeper saved again
 from Lahm, pushing the ball over the bar just when Kroos was starting 
to influence this game in a way that we have become accustomed to. In 
the end they settled for extra-time and Schurrle was sharp enough to 
react to Muller’s teasing ball across the six-yard box with a somewhat 
fortuitous flick.

Ozil added another in the final minute of 
extra-time and then there was some glory for Algeria as Djabou scored an
 absolute pearl in the dying seconds.

There was no time for a fightback, but Algeria can be proud after quite a night here. For Germany, it was quite a fright.
