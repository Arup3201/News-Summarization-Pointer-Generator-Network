A woman driver crashed and killed her boyfriend when she lost control of her car while trying to turn down the radio during an argument.

Laura Hauerslev, 22, and Alec Pearn, 24, had been up late the night before and were not on good terms when they set off on a trip to visit her family.

Hauerslev had a headache and the couple argued over what radio station to listen to. Mr Pearn turned the volume up twice, and she turned it down.

It was while doing so that Hauerslev took her eyes off road and hit a kerb before losing control of her Citroen Saxo.

Mr Pearn, who was not wearing his seat belt, tried to grab the steering wheel but ‘it was too late’, a court heard yesterday.

The car, which was travelling at 70mph on a 60mph road and had three tyres with insufficient tread, rolled and hit a tree on the A30 near Bridestowe, Devon, last September. Mr Pearn died of multiple injuries in the collision.

Hauerslev escaped prison yesterday when Exeter Crown Court heard Mr Pearn’s family did not want to see her put behind bars.

She admitted causing death by careless driving and was given a 12-month community order and told to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work. She was also banned from driving for two years.

Judge Francis Gilbert QC told her: ‘I treat it as a tragic accident caused by a momentary loss of concentration.’

The court heard the couple were happy but communicated with ‘jokey arguments’. Prosecutor Peter Coombe said they had been arguing about ‘a most silly thing’ when the accident happened.

The judge praised the actions of Michael Cazaly, 50, a passing motorist who risked his life by getting soaked in petrol crawling under wreckage to pull Hauerslev out and try to help Mr Pearn.

Judge Gilbert commended Mr Cazaly’s courage in ‘putting himself at considerable risk’, saying: ‘He did very well.’

The court was told Mr Cazaly, who could see immediately that Mr Pearn was dead, heard Hauerslev shout: ‘Help, get me out.’

After he helped free her, she asked him how her boyfriend was. Mr Cazaly tried to comfort her by saying he was fine. Later, on learning that Mr Pearn was dead, Hauerslev said: ‘I have killed him.’

Lee Bremridge, defending, said it ‘will live with her for the rest of her life and she is deeply sorry to Alec’s family for what happened and the loss of their son’.

After the hearing Mr Pearn’s father Andy and brother Colin hugged Hauerslev.

The family said he had been ‘dearly loved, well liked and respected by all who knew him’.
