A Welsh grandmother who was fed up with making scarves and jumpers has turned her talents to knitting celebrities and super-heroes. 

Denise Salway, 51, began by creating a model of ITV comedian Alan Carr out of wool for her daughter, who was 'over the moon' with the gift. Friends and family flooded Ms Salway, a retired factory worker from Bridgend, South Wales, with requests.

Before long she was making models of 
the Queen, Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, Freddie Mercury, Abraham Lincoln, 
Audrey Hepburn, Superman, Darth Vader, Minnie Mouse and characters from 
The Lord of The Rings.

'It
 took me a few goes to master Alan's open-mouthed smile and to get his 
glasses right,' she said. 'I take some time to really stare at a 
celebrity before I start - you have to capture all their little quirks 
to get it just right. Like Marilyn Monroe's mole and Abraham Lincoln's 
sideburns.' 

Ms Salway, started knitting as a young teenager and uses no patterns. 'The ideas all come from my imagination.'

'People
 think knitting is for boring grannies in their rocking chairs but I 
knit to crime dramas and loud rock music on my juke box,' she said.

'It's a great hobby for young and old.'

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? It's Superman in wool, the creation of Denise Salway, 51, from Bridgend. The grandmother of one said she knits while watching crime dramas or listening to loud rock music

Felt presents: after the success of knitting Alan Carr, friends and family asked Ms Salway to make models of their favourite characters and celebrities. It was only a matter of time before someone selected Star Wars' Chewbacca and Darth Vader

Fame: the Star Wars' characters are instantly recognisable and translated into wool - even down to the detail of Chewbacca's strap

Detail: Alan Carr's open-mouthed smile and his glasses proved a challenge, but Ms Salway said she enjoys paying attention to the detail of each figure

Marilyn moment: Ms Salway's woollen version of the ever-iconic Marilyn Monroe is adorned with its own necklace, earrings and bangles

Homer: no jewellery required here, only that familiar Simpsons yellow, white for the bulging round eyes and brown for around the mouth

Breakfast at Tiffany's: Audrey Hepburn's black dress and elegant long gloves, along with the top-knot hairdo give this wool model its character

Creative: Denise Salway says she doesn't use knitting patterns, only her imagination
