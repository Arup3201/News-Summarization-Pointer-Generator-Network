Tesla’s Model S is becoming the ‘it’ car among the U.S. jet set.

The Elon Musk-designed electric car is now the most-registered car in eight of the States’ 25 wealthiest zip codes, beating out a host of luxury car makers long associated with the lifestyle of the rich and famous.

Though the battery-powered roadster has surpassed all other cars in many neighborhoods, but all are in California, according to Edmunds.

Atherton, CA (1st overall)  - 15.4 per cent

Los Altos Hills, CA (2nd overall) - 11.9 per cent

Portola Valley, CA (9th overall) - 11.2 per cent

Los Altos Hills, CA (14th overall) - 9.3 per cent

Montecito, CA (17th overall) - 3.4 per cent

Newport Coast, CA (18th overall) - 2.8 per cent

Monte Sereno, CA (22nd overall) - 6.5 per cent

Woodside, CA (23rd overall) - 5.7 per cent

The futuristic car enjoys shocking double-digit market share in some California communities, according to a detailed breakdown on the site.

More than 15 per cent of all cars registered in Atherton, by far the country’s wealthiest zip code with median home prices well north of $6million, are Teslas.

Los Altos Hills, comes in second with 11.9 per cent of registered cars bearing the Tesla name, and is followed by Portola Valley’s 11.2 per cent.

Most California towns racing to buy the Model S are in and around Tesla’s Palo Alto headquarters, Edmunds noted.

The only non-Golden State zip codes reflecting at least a 1 per cent market share for Tesla are Hamptons hot spot Water Mill, at 1.5 per cent, and Manhattan’s West Village with exactly 1 per cent.

Mercedes Benz came in second on the list, but required it’s entire fleet of models to do so.The Jeep Grand Cherokee rounded out the top three, Forbes noted.

Mr Musk, Tesla’s CEO, has previously announced aggressive plans to expand the car’s market share by building more affordable cars in the coming years. The Model S currently retails for about $70,000 in the U.S. and accounts for about 0.1 per cent of the country's auto sales.

More details about the company’s sales should be available during a Tuesday earnings call.
