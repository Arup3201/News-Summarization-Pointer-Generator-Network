More than 500,000 elderly patients are needlessly being taken to A&E every year because they are not being properly looked after at home, according to the care watchdog.

Many are becoming desperately malnourished, succumbing to infections or falling and breaking bones due to failings by GPs and care home staff.

The Care Quality Commission has calculated that the number of avoidable admissions amongst the elderly has soared by 40 per cent in five years which is partly why A&E units are under such pressure.

Concerns: Inspectors found that records were not being kept of whether elderly people in homes needed help with meals, if they had lost weight or if they needed to be rolled over to prevent bedsores (file picture)

Its inspectors found that records were not being kept of whether elderly people in homes needed help with meals, if they had lost weight or if they needed to be rolled over to prevent bedsores.

In one home, they came across five bedbound patients left alone in their rooms with no drinking water.

The watchdog calculates that 1 in 10 of the over 75s and 1 in 5 of those over 90 are being admitted to A&E needlessly - some of whom will never return home.

Many elderly patients quickly deteriorate once in hospital and become confused, reluctant to eat or develop chest or urinary infections.

The CQC is particularly concerned about dementia sufferers who are 37 per cent more likely to die in hospital than all other patients.

David Behan, Chief Executive of the watchdog said: ‘GPs, care homes, home care agencies, community health services and hospitals, with local commissioners, must plan effectively to make sure our older and more vulnerable people are cared for in the way they deserve.

‘Where care can be provided for people outside of hospitals, it is better for them and eases pressures on hospital services.’

Caroline Abrahams charity director at Age UK said: ‘The numbers of older people being admitted to hospital when with the right care they could stay at home is distressing and a sad consequence of a social care system that so often fails to help the people who need it.

‘Older people must be able to receive the treatment and care they need when they need it.

‘However cuts to social care budgets has forced local authorities to increasingly restrict access to social care support leaving many older people to struggle on until they reach breaking point and have a serious health crisis or an accident and end up in hospital. This is not only morally wrong but makes no financial sense.’

There is growing concern that this winter could be the worst ever for A&E units which are struggling to cope with the soaring numbers of patients and severe shortages of senior doctors.

Last week the NHS’s medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh announced plans to ease the crisis which included beefing up the NHS 111 helpline and increasing GP appointments.

The CQC analysed hospital admission figures for conditions which could have been prevented through better care such as pneumonia, falls, urinary infections and the worsening of long-term illnesses like diabetes.

Working together: Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said the elderly were not supported enough

There were 535,000 such admissions for the over-65s last year, up from 374,000 in 2007/8.

Its inspectors found one care home in Romford, Essex, where residents were visited by a GP once a week who failed to record their weight or details about their needs.

Two patients had developed pressure sores because care home staff were not aware they needed to be moved.

At another nursing home nearby bedbound patients were not given any water while at another centre nurses had no idea how often they changed wound dressings.

Norman Lamb, care and support minister said: ‘We know too many older people don’t get the right support in the community, leaving them at high risk of repeated admissions to A&E.

‘We want to make the whole health system work together around the patient, so that more people get the help they need before emergency treatment is required.’
