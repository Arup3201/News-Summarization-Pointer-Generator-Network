Following visits to the FRANK website during a Government campaign to warn teenagers of the dangers of 'new psychoactive substances' (NPS), 22 per cent of 15-to-18-year-olds said they were more likely to use legal highs in the future.

Just over a third (34 per cent) claimed they were less likely.

The results of the survey emerged in an answer to a written parliamentary question from shadow home affairs minister Diana Johnson.
