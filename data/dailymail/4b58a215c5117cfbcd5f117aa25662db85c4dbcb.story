American Apparel is never shy when it comes to pushing boundaries with previous campaigns, including one featuring models dressed up as schoolgirls, causing huge debate. 

Happily, its latest collection is a little more feel-good.

For its newest collection of t-shirts the brand has enlisted previous RuPaul Drag Race contestants, Alaska, Courtney Act and Willam Belli as brand ambassadors, models and muses.

We three Queens: Drag artists Alaska, Courtney Act and Willam are the new American Apparel ad girls

The three famous drag Queens appear on a trio of exclusive concert-inspired t-shirts, which are available online for a limited time only, with just 500 of each t-shirt produced.

The exclusive t-shirts come as a follow-up to the brand's partnership with artist Petra Collins for the 'Support Artists, Support Ethical Manufacturing' campaign, for which Collins' artwork was printed on a series of T-shirts.

The Toronto-based artist's T-shirts featured a drawing of a menstruating vagina, which she claimed intended to open three taboo topics for discussion: 'pubic hair, masturbation, and menstruation.'

The partnership with the three drag artists is tamer, with each drag artist appearing, fully-clothed, as a silk-screen print.

The collaboration came about after one of American Apparel's previous designers, Jonny Makeup worked with Courtney and Willam on the makeover programme Transfashionable.

Jonny told Out magazine that the three  were an obvious choice for the brand.

'It was only natural to get them involved with American Apparel' said the 31-year-old designer.

Willam Belli, 32, is best known for her appearance on the reality TV series RuPaul's Drag Race as well as her Youtube channel where she broadcasts a series of video reviews called Willam's Beatdown.

The drag artist told the Huffington Post that her role as a campaign girl for American Apparel was a dream come true.

'Every little boy dreams of being on a baseball card' adding that he was proud to work with a company so keen to support drag.

'American Apparel has continually supported artists and I love that we can bring attention from our campaign to some of our favorite causes ourselves AND the ethical manufacturing of these super cool t shirts.'

As well as the campaign imagery, Willam, Alaska and Courtney appear in a music video alongside several half naked men.

The song, 'American Apparel Ad Girls,' is a parody of Capital Cities' 'Farrah Fawcett Hair' and is available to download at iTunes.
