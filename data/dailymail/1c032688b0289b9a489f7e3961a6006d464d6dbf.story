Courageous: Ann Carrizales, 40, chased the suspects who shot her in the face during a traffic stop

Dashcam video showing the shocking moment a female police officer dubbed 'Robocop' chased the gunman who shot her twice has been released, as police hunt two men who escaped on foot.

Ann Carrizales, 40, was shot in the face and chest at point-blank range during a routine traffic stop in Stafford, Texas, about 3.40am on Saturday.

The Nissan Altima sped off and she fired, smashing the back window.

But refusing to give up, the former Marine and boxer got back into her patrol car and pursued the gunman.

'It wasn't an option for me to give up,' she explained to the Today show.

'I am a mom and they shot 
me and they were absolutely not going to get away with that, because I 
will do everything I can to come home to my children every day.'

Footage from her vehicle's dashcam shows the moment the wounded cop jumped back into her patrol car, called for backup and bravely pursued her attackers for about 20 miles.

'Shots fired, shots fired, I'm hit,' Carrizales can be heard telling the police dispatcher. 'I'm still conscious. It looks like he's south-bound.'

Officer Carrizales bravely pursued her assailants into Houston, Texas, including after they opened fire on a busy highway.

The pursuit ended in the area of Greenfork Drive and Concourse Drive. The shooter's car disappeared, and the three occupants fled on foot.

'I've lost him, I'm not going to pursue down that street,' Carrizalestold the dispatcher. 'Let's get out this area. I don't feel safe here.'

Officers who arrived on scene embraced Carrizales, who was injured but composed.

Carrizales, who was named top cop by her
colleagues last year, went to hospital but was released that night. She
will wear a bandage on her cheek and will be working in-house until she 
recovers.

Officers
from a neighboring police department helped apprehend the alleged 
gunman, Sergio Francisco Rodriguez, 21, after he was cornered in an 
apartment complex.

Rodriguez is charged with aggravated assault on an officer.

An
active warrant for aggravated assault on a peace officer has been 
issued for the driver, 28-year-old Freddy Henriquez. Police said he 
should be considered armed and dangerous.

He
is also reportedly a Honduras native wanted by Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement for illegally re-entering the United States as a violent 
felon. Â 

Manhunt: Police have posted a $10,000 reward for the capture of fugitives Freddy Henriquez, 28, (left) and Daniel Cruz (aka Jose Luis Cruz) (right)

Hit: After she was shot, she returned fire, smashing the suspects' rear window. She then followed in her car

Arrest: Sergio Rodriquez allegedly shot the officer after she stopped him and two others on Saturday

Police are also looking for Daniel 
Cruz, aka Jose Luis Cruz. He is wanted for questioning and has not been 
charged at this time.

Police said he had the word 'Houstone'
tattooed on his neck, a tattoo of a city skyline on his left arm, a 
tattoo of a star on his right forearm and a tattoo of a cross under his 
left eye.

There are 
pronounced gang ties with all three men, including MS-13 connections, 
according to Stafford Police spokesman James Leedom.

Houston 
Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information 
leading to the filing of felony charges or the arrest of the suspects.

Carrizales has been hailed a hero for not giving up, and leading police to her attackers.

'I think it speaks highly of her character, her fortitude,' police spokesman Dustin Claborn said.

Members of the Stafford Police Department, where she has worked since August 2010, have called her 'Robocop' in reference to the film character.

'I knew that it was what I needed to do, to catch these guys,' Carrizales said. 'You can't shoot me and drive away: It's not allowed.'

Tough: 40-year-old Carrizales (pictured left), a mother of two, is also a former Marine and a former boxer

Impressive: Carrizales, right with her husband, was named 'Officer of the Year' in her department last year
