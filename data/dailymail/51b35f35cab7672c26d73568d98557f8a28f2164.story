Britain is in the grip of a buy-to-let boom with a record number of ‘landlords loans’ worth an all-time high of more than £160billion, official figures revealed yesterday.

The figures, from the Council of Mortgage Lenders, showed there are 1.42 million buy-to-let mortgages, compared to just 89,000 a decade ago.

Experts said landlords are cashing in on the fact that a generation of young people are frozen off the housing ladder by the crippling cost of buying a home.

With millions of young people unable 
to buy their own home, they have no choice but to rent at an age when 
they would much prefer to be in their own property.

The average rent has jumped by 4.3 per cent in the last year to £718 per calendar month.

This is just £2 below an all-time record, according to the lettings giant LSL Property Services.

In London – where it has hit a record – the average monthly rent is £1,047.

A
report, which will be published today [fri], highlights how rents are 
rising in Britain because ‘many would-be buyers continue to find 
themselves locked out of the sales market.’

Over
the last year, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said rents 
have jumped by 4.3 per cent, a much bigger jump than most people’s pay 
rises.

Many public sector workers are subject to a two-year pay freeze, and the average pay rise in the private sector is three per cent, according to the pay experts Incomes Data Services.

Peter Bolton King, global residential director of RICS, said: ‘Rents have grown steadily right across the UK for some time.

‘This is partly down to the problem of the scarcity of mortgage finance and the large deposits required by lenders.

‘These barriers to homeownership need to be addressed.’

Today, a typical first-time buyer puts down a 20 per cent deposit. Before the credit crunch, which marked its fifth anniversary yesterday, it was only 10 per cent.

RICS predicts rents will continue to rise over the next year, with many of its members, who are lettings agents, describing the market as ‘very busy’, ‘buoyant’ with ‘strong demand.’

Ed Stansfield, chief UK property economist at the consultancy, Capital Economics, said: ‘Landlords are having few problems letting property to frustrated would-be buyers.’

A third of recent first-time buyers were over the age of 34 by the time they managed to get onto the property ladder, according to the Government’s English Housing Survey.

It showed the number of households who are privately renting, such as parents with young children, has ballooned to its highest level since the 1970s.

There are 3.6million households who are privately renting from a landlord in 2010/11, the latest available figures, compared to just two million a decade ago.

In England, there are 14.45million homeowners, but the figure peaked at 14.8million in 2006.

Mark Harris, chief executive of the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ‘It is no surprise that the buy-to-let sector continues with its strong performance.

‘As would-be first-time buyers continue to struggle to get on the housing ladder, more people are turning to renting.

‘This is pushing up rents, making the sector increasingly attractive to investors.’

Between April and June, a total of 33,200 buy-to-let loans were handed out, up 14 per cent over the last year, according to the CML.
