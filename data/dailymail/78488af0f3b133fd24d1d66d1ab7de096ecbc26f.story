Liverpool's understudy keeper Brad Jones has hit back at Gary Neville's criticism of his team-mate Simon Mignolet as speculation continues to linger about Victor Valdes signing for the club.

Neville gave a damning analysis of the Belgian's performance in Liverpool's 1-1 draw with rivals Everton on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show last month.

But 32-year-old Jones, who is yet to feature for Brendan Rodgers' side this season, found criticism from the former Manchester United right-back and Sky Sports pundit excessive, especially considering he has no experience of playing between the sticks.

He told the Liverpool Echo: 'I've never seen Gary Neville play in goal but he seemed to have a good opinion of it.

'Everyone has an opinion. What we work on in training is very match-specific and match-related. It's just one of those things and there are too many opinions knocking about nowadays. 

'There are not too many people who speak highly of goalkeepers. They tend to want to put them down.'

Mignolet, 26, has been unable to replicate the kind of form he showed last season, managing only one clean sheet in 10 league and cup games for the club so far this campaign.

However, Jones has backed the Belgian to return to his best as Liverpool look to get back on track after a frustrating start to the season.

He added: 'He is strong minded enough to get on with his job and understand what happens. It is a shame that it happens because last season he produced some massive saves that helped us win games and people tend to forget them.

'Then the press jump on it and want to criticise him and say someone else is coming into the club and this and that. 

'It is important to let him get on with his job and to continue doing the things he was doing last season.'
