More than 4,000 U.S. soldiers are heading to Kuwait, opening up the possibility of an intervention in Iraq after President Barack Obama asked Congress to authorize military action against terrorists in the Middle East. 

The Commander-in-chief has ruled out large-scale U.S. ground combat operations similar to those in Iraq and Afghanistan, but he asked for the option to use military force against Islamic State fighters for three years. 

The fight could be extended to any 'closely related successor entity' to the Islamic State organization that has overrun parts of Iraq and Syria, imposed an extreme form of Sharia law and killed several hostages it has taken.

The U.S. Army has kept a brigade in Kuwait since the end of the Iraq war in 2011. 

Those soldiers, including two units from Fort Carson, have worked to train local troops from throughout the Middle East. 

In its most recent deployment to Kuwait, a combat team from Fort Carson conducted training missions with allies including Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, which have joined the coalition against Islamic State fighters.

The unit headed to Kuwait is Fort Carson's heaviest force, armed with tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. Many of its soldiers are veterans of one or more of the brigade's previous combat tours in Iraq.

'We're no strangers to deployment,' said the brigade's commander, Col. Greg Sierra.

The brigade has trained more than a year for the Kuwait mission. The soldiers practiced combat skills last used in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Colorado Springs Gazette reported.

The brigade's training regimen readied soldiers for a range of missions from humanitarian relief to nonstop combat, Sierra said.

Sierra told soldiers and their families that if his brigade tangles with Islamic State fighters, the outcome won't be in doubt. 'In the end, if we do get into fights, we win decisively,' he said. 

The deployment comes as Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi confirmed plans to retake Iraq's third city, Mosul, from the jihadists by the end of the year. 

He insisted he did not want 'boots on the ground' from the international coalition but asked for ammunition, aid cover and training. 

'I was a bit frustrated in my first three months of being prime minister because of the slowness of this support, but I have seen in the last four weeks, five weeks, an acceleration of this support,' he told the BBC.

Obama is currently in Southern California with his wife and daughters. On Sunday he played golf at a course privately owned by the billionaire co-founder of Oracle software, Larry Ellison.

The White House says Obama's golfing group includes three childhood friends from Hawaii who are regular golf companions when the president is on the West Coast. 

He is expected to return to Washington on Monday evening. 

On Sunday, Libya's internationally recognised prime minister called for the West to launch air strikes to defeat Islamist militants who control Tripoli and have driven his government out of the capital.

Speaking hours before Egypt bombed Islamic State targets in Libya in retaliation after militants said they had beheaded 21 Egyptian Christians, Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni made a plea for Western military intervention in a country rapidly slipping into chaos.

'We have absolutely confirmed information that al Qaeda and IS are in Tripoli and....near Ben Jawad,' he said, referring to a central town controlled by a faction that supports a rival government.

'I ask world powers stand by Libya and launch military strikes against these groups,' he said. 'This threat will move to European countries, especially Italy.'
