A businessman died after being ambushed by raiders when he stepped outside his house for a cigarette to avoid watching Celebrity Big Brother, a court heard yesterday.

Edward Syrad, 64, left while his wife Anne watched the reality show when he was allegedly pounced on by Gezim Delijah, 41, and an accomplice who tied him up and demanded access to his safe.

Mr Syrad died from coronary heart disease brought on as a result of the attack, the Old Bailey in central London heard. Mrs Syrad, now 62, told the court how she was also tied up by the raiders.

Death: Edward Syrad (left), 64, of Barnehurst, Kent, went outside while his wife watched the show, when he was allegedly pounced on by Gezim Delijah (right), 41, and an accomplice in January 2012

She said two masked men had stormed her bedroom in Barnehurst, Kent, as she watched glamour model Nicola McLean be evicted from Celebrity Big Brother on Channel 5 in January last year.

'I wanted to watch Big Brother because it was the final and I really like it,' Mrs Syrad added. 'Ted [Edward] didn't like it that much so I said I would go and watch in bed and he'd join me later.

On TV: Anne Syrad said two men had stormed her room as she watched glamour model Nicola McLean (pictured) be evicted from Celebrity Big Brother

'I was just watching Big Brother and 
the door opened a little bit and there was a man standing there. I 
immediately thought it was Ted, I don't know why. I said: "What are you 
doing?".

â€˜It looked like he
had something on his head. The next thing I know the man just jumped on
me. I said: "Ted, what are you doing?". It was silly, but I just 
thought it was him.'

In fact, the last time she saw her husband alive was around five minutes earlier when he came into the bedroom to ask her for some crisps.

Mrs Syrad said she had broken her nails and glasses in a struggle with one of the attackers, whom she described as having an Irish accent.

She told the court: 'I said to him: "Just take anything and go. I've got a telly, video, iPad." He said to me he just wanted money.'

Mrs Syrad said a second man with an Eastern European accent had tied her up as the Irish man told her to cross her hands.

Although she resisted, she said: 'In the end I thought to myself if I don't, what's going to happen to me, so I did it. Then the second man was putting the tape stuff round me.'

The Eastern European man then left the room and returned several minutes later. Mrs Syrad said: 'He showed me a key and said, "This key doesn't fit the safe."

'He said: "If you give me another key and it doesn't fit I'll kill you. Then he got out what I thought was a gun and he just showed it to me.'

Delijah, of Walthamstow, north-east London, denies manslaughter, robbery and possessing an imitation firearm. The trial continues.
