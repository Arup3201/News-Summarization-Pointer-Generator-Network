Pepperoni lovers are extroverts, diners who like pizzas topped with an egg are supportive and veggie fans are flirtatious.  

According to a study, pizza fans who pick particular toppings reveal more than their favourite flavours when they create their perfect pie.

The research also revealed the compatibility of the different pizza personalities, proving that the way to a person's heart is through their stomach. 

Dr Alan Hirsch's study reveals that pizza toppings can say a lot about person's character

Dr Hirsch used a bespoke form of Pizza Rorschach testing to analyse the results

Smell and taste expert Dr Alan Hirsch's research showed personality traits can be summed up according to preferred pizza toppings. 

This sort of information is advantageous when it comes to a first date, as Dr Hirsch explains: 'You can tell a lot about someone by what they like on their pizza, which is useful when you're on a date. 

'You don't just need to ask questions to get to know them; look at what they order to find out if they really are your perfect match or not.' 

Carbonara Roma: Fans of this egg-based pizza are said to be good with money, cynical and cautious 

Mare Rossa Romana: According to the results, seafood lovers are principled, intelligent and critical

Among the other discoveries were that people who love a debate or might be described as cautious or good with money would usually opt for a creamy béchamel-based pizza. 

Having goat's cheese on your doughy dish means you are most likely to be sensitive and easy-going.

And pepperoni lovers tend to display extrovert characteristics, while diners who like pizzas topped with an egg are supportive and trustworthy but don't naturally seek out the limelight. 

Meat eaters are classified as supportive homebodies whilst those who like chicken toppings are driven, competitive and assertive.

The way to the heart is through the stomach:  If the hypothesis is right, this could lead to interesting coupling

According to Dr Hirsch lovers of spicy food tend to be a risk-takers

Dr Hirsch used a bespoke form of Pizza Rorschach testing – similar to the inkblot tests used to decipher underlying character traits – to analyse what toppings say about a person.

'It's long been known, thanks to Freud, that your personality will dictate what you look for in your food,' Dr Hirsch said.

'For example, if you like spicy foods then you tend to be a risk-taker and like the adrenaline rush that comes with it, whereas people who prefer a lot of protein in their meal are often more sociable or outgoing. 

'Food can be such an emotive thing – the taste, texture, smell – and we often prefer certain foods because of an underlying personality trait.'  

The pizza personalities were generated using a pool of 500 British adults who took part in a comprehensive range of psychiatric and personality tests

Head of Menu at Pizza Express, Holly Davies, says: 'Our work with Dr Hirsch has given us real insight into why we tend to order the same thing when we go back to our favourite restaurants. 

'We're calling for people to try something different this month. You might just discover your new favourite suits your personality better – or find a new person to be compatible with.'
