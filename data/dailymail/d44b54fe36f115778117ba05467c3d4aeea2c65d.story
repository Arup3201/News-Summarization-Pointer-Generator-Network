The Bayern Munich players laced up their boots one final time ahead of making their way to Lviv to face Ukrainian opponents Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League last 16.

With the game relocated from Shakhtar's usual surroundings in the conflict-torn eastern city of Donetsk, Pep Guardiola's men were looking sharp ahead of their 1500 mile round-trip.

Franck Ribery looked to be in a particularly intense frame of mind as the Bundesliga leaders took to the chilly training pitches in Munich.

Competition favourites Bayern go into the game full of confidence after their 8-0 annihilation of Hamburg on Saturday, as they look to help book themselves a place in the semi-finals for the fourth consecutive season.

With Ribery netting the last of the eight goals at the Allianz Arena, and the stellar Arjen Robben curling in his 13th league goal of the season in a near-perfect performance from the home side, the odds look to be stacked in Bayern's favour.

Added to this, Shakhtar will also be travelling some 800 miles themselves to take part in the face off and will be without duo Bernard and Taras Stepanenko. 

'For us, [not playing in Donetsk] is a big problem, because we are not playing at home, we are playing away, a new arena,' Shakhtar captain Darijo Srna told Associated Press.

'You don't have the power like you have at the Donbass Arena. The Donbass Arena is something special - it's our stadium, it's our fans, it's our city.'
