A murderer has been told in prison that he is to become Britain’s youngest grandfather at the age of 27.

The man stabbed a Good Samaritan to death shortly after fathering his daughter when he was just 14.

Now the girl – who is 13 – has announced to friends on Facebook that she is pregnant by a boy of her own age.

Young mother: A 13-year-old girl has become pregnant, which will make her 27-year-old father, in jail for murder, Britain's youngest grandfather (file picture)

Last night, the family told of their 
despair at the situation. ‘She has only ever seen her dad in prison,’ 
one aunt told the Mail.

‘She
 had no chance. Her dad was furious when he heard she is pregnant but he
 did the same so what could he say?’ The murderer’s mother, who will 
become a great-grandmother at 47, is being consoled by friends at her 
home in the South West.

The
 girl’s 28-year-old mother has promised to take responsibility for the 
baby. The jailed murderer cannot be named because to do so would 
identify his daughter, who is a minor.

He
 was imprisoned for 11 years for murdering a man who tried to intervene 
in a robbery. He was due for release last year but his sentence has been
 extended until next year because he tried to escape from jail.

He
 apparently begged his daughter not to go through with the pregnancy, 
but she has since posted messages online about the baby. She uploaded a 
hospital scan to Facebook, saying she was five months’ pregnant.

Social media message: The 13-year-old girl posted pictures of her scans on Facebook when she was five months' pregnant, it was reported

Friends
 said they were ‘proud’ of her for keeping the child, with one adding: 
‘Hurry up and push that baby out. You and ******* are going to be the 
best mum and dad.’

The girl
 has been taken out of school and is now being taught at a special unit 
for pregnant teens. She still lives with her mother, who has a new 
partner and two young boys.

Last night, the girl’s mother and maternal grandmother declined to comment.

However,
 another family member said of the murderer and his daughter: ‘His 
cousins would take her to prison to see him. He would ask if she was 
doing her homework.

‘He’d say: “You better had been.” But he’s a kid himself, he does not know what parenting is about.’

The
 title of Britain’s youngest grandfather is currently held by Shem 
Davies, of Bridgend, South Wales, whose 14-year-old daughter gave birth 
to a girl when he was 29.

Mr
 Davies said at the time: ‘She’ll be a brilliant mum. At first I wasn’t 
overly pleased that she was pregnant but I soon got over that. Now it’s 
all about being positive.’

The number of teenage mothers in the UK is five times higher than in the Netherlands and twice that of France and Spain.
