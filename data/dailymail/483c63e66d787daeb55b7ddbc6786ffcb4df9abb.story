It sounds like a scene from an episode of the popular and long-running cartoon The Simpsons.

A defendant called Bart Simpson, appearing in court in front of a judge called Mr Burns.

However, this isn't a fictional case but a real-life trial which took place at Warwick Crown Court this week.

Bizarre: A defendant called Bart Simpson, appearing in court in front of a judge called Mr Burns at Warwick Crown Court

Company Director Barton Simpson, 56,  stood trial in front of Mr Recorder Burns at Warwick Crown Court on Monday.

He was spared jail after admitting that he carried a .38 Smith and Wesson revolver in his luggage while catching a flight at Birmingham airport in May last year.

Mr Burns sentenced Simpson to a 12-month community order with 140 hours of unpaid work and ordered him to pay Â£800 costs.

The defendant was flying to Croatia when he put his bag through an X-ray machine which detected the weapon.

He told police the gun, which he inherited from his father, was a 'curio' and that he had forgotten it was in his holdall.

Stars: Bart Simpson and Mr Burns are long-running characters in The Simpsons

Andrew Wilkins, prosecuting, said 
Simpson normally kept the revolver at his home in Eccleshall, 
Staffordshire and realised his mistake almost immediately.

'He put his hands to his face and hesitated before he then went through the personal metal detector,' the lawyer said.

'The reason he said he had it with 
him, and there is no reason to disagree, was that he was having work 
done on his flat while he was travelling and did not want it to come 
into the hands of the decorator.'

Mr Wilkins said Simpson had intended 
to leave the gun locked in his car, but he was distracted because of 
circumstances including the deaths of a friend and of his son, a serving
soldier.

Mr Burns told Simpson: 'It was a very stupid thing you did. You must be punished for it, but I think you can be dealt with by way of a community order.'

A court worker said: 'It's a bizarre 
coincidence that Bart Simpson is actually on trial in front of Mr Burns 
but it'll proceed as any other criminal case would.

'There were some eyebrows raised when the court list was published.'

The fictional Bart Simpson is the main character in the popular, long-running animated television series The Simpsons.

He is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge.

Charles Montgomery 'Monty' Burns, often referred to as Mr Burns, is the evil owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He is the boss of Bart's father Homer.
