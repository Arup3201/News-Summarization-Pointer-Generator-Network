California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn is still furious about his horse missing out on the Triple Crown and waded into controversy on Sunday by making clumsy comments about disabled people.

Even after a night's sleep to think over calling Belmont Stakes winner Tonalist a 'coward' for not running in the Kentucky Derby, Coburn labored his point that California Chrome was at a disadvantage having raced three times in five weeks,

'That would be like me at 6'2" playing basketball against a kid in a wheelchair,' said the 61-year-old horse owner during an interview on Sunday with Good Morning America.

Critical: California Chrome owner Steve Coburn, pictured, said his horse 'had a target on his back' and complained that other horses in the Belmont Stakes - like winner Tonalist - did not compete in the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness Stakes

The irate co-owner repeated this awkward analogy three times during his round of morning interviews, despite its quesionable tone.

'Triple Crown, that means three — not one, not two — triple means three,' he said.

'If you don’t realize that maybe you need to go back to school and figure this out. Triple means three.

'If something isn’t done I will never see a Triple Crown winner again. I’m 61 years old.'

Coburn is furious that his horse was denied the Crown by Tonalist, who was allowed to enter the Belmont Stakes despite not competing in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes.

'We won the Kentucky Derby and we won the Preakness,”' Coburn said.

'We earned the points to run in the Kentucky Derby. We did not have to race in the Preakness or the Belmont but we nominated to the Triple Crown.'

He was asked during the Good Morning America interview if thought his wheelchair comparison offensive.

'No, I'm just trying to compare the two,' he said. 'Is it fair for me to play with this child in a wheelchair? Is it fair for them to hold their horses back?'

Coburn said he has no problems if people label him a 'sore loser' and even proceeded to give out his phone number so people can call him with their complaints.

Big finish: Tonalist (11) with Joel Rosario up edges out Commissioner with Javier Castellano up to win the 146th running of the Belmont Stakes horse race on Saturday

Yesterday, California Chrome owner Steve Coburn complained that other horses were entered just to knock out California Chrome as his horse's bid to win the Triple Crown was ruined on Saturday.

Tonalist, the Belmont Stakes winner, did not run the Kentucky 
Derby or the Preakness Stakes.

California Chrome tied for fourth place in a dead heat with horse Wicked Strong. 
Commissioner came in second place, while Medal Count came in third.

California
 Chrome and jockey Victor Espinoza lost the 1 1/2-mile race on a hot day
 at Belmont Park, where tens of thousands of fans were packed in hoping 
to see history. It was not to be, leaving Affirmed as the most recent 
Triple Crown winner in 1978.

'It's all or nothing. This is not fair to these horses and to the people that believe in them. This is the coward's way out,' he told NBC.

'Our horse had a target on his back,' Coburn said.

'I thought
 he was gaining ground, but he didn't have it in him, apparently,' Coburn said of California Chrome's performance. 'These other horses, they always set him out. They set him up and try to upset the apple cart.'

He also said, 'I'm 61 years old and I'll never see another Triple Crown winner in my lifetime because of the way they do this, it's not fair to these horses that have been in the game since day one.'

California Chrome broke quickly but was pressed immediately by Commissioner and General a Rod. Espinoza eased California Chrome back into third along the rail.

Approaching the final turn, California Chrome was maneuvered to the outside. He angled four-wide turning for home, just to the outside of Tonalist, who was close to the pace the entire race. Espinoza started whipping left handed in the lane but California Chrome had no response.

Tonalist kicked strongly in the final strides, edging Commissioner by a head to finish in 2:28:52.

The defeat
 snapped California Chrome's six-race winning streak. His rise from a 
humble pedigree and his working-stiff owners resonated with sports fans 
who rarely take an interest in horse racing.

California
 Chrome's owners spent $8,000 on a mare they bred to a stallion for 
$2,500, and were called 'dumb asses' by a trainer for buying a mare who 
gave no indication that she could produce a standout offspring who could
 run fast.

Belmont
 Park race track was earlier buzzing on Saturday as crowds gathered to 
watch California Chrome try and win the Triple Crown.

The
 Long Island track - said to the the toughest of the three - had to add 
extra facilities after a surge in interest over the possibility that the horse could become the first racehorse in 36 years to pull 
off the feat.

Crowds
 began arriving early at the track, with an array of brightly colored 
and creative headgear - from wide-brimmed sunhats with ruffles and 
delicate fascinators to more imaginative offerings.

One racegoer had styled his Stetson-style hat around California Chrome. Tiny trophies adorned each side, a cutout photo of the racehorse raced across the brim, and a large Belmont Stakes sign poked above the wearer's head.

Another fan clearly rooting for the chestnut colt was spotted wearing a silver construction worker's helmet that had a crown and the number 3 attached. The creation was being worn on top of the person's baseball hat.

Many of the women attending the event opted for more elegant headwear, with large-brimmed sunhats in fuchsia pinks and mint greens a popular choice.

Feathers, flowers, ruffles and other adornments helped the hats stand out in the crowd, as an estimated 100,000 race fans gathered ahead of the big race at 6.52pm.

California Chrome was on a six-race winning streak, which included being first past the post for the Kentucky Derby on May 3, and Preakness Stakes in Maryland on May 17.

With odds set at 4/5 Chrome had been the favorite to win the Belmont title - 
and become the first horse since 1978 to become a Triple Crown winner.

Only
 11 horses have managed the feat, with Affirmed being the last. Since 
then, 12 horses have captured the first two legs without completing the 
equine hat trick.

The California Chrome camp earlier possessed a quiet confidence that they had the long-awaited Triple Crown champion.

'The
 horse is doing great, I couldn't ask anything more from him,' Alan 
Sherman, assistant trainer to his father Art Sherman, said. 'I'm looking
 forward to the race. I think if he runs his race, he's going to be 
pretty solid.'

On Friday the horse was given the opportunity to shake off any race day nerves, with a visit to the paddock and track areas, before being taken for gallop.

'He's training outstanding. Nothing seems to bother him too much. He's pretty cool,' Sherman said.

California Chrome had to navigate the testing ground at Belmont, which includes a lap around 'Big Sandy' - its deep and exhausting track.

However, his veteran trainer Art Sherman, felt positive before the race. The 77-year-old said: 'I feel more confident coming into this race than I did any race. I'm getting pumped up.'
