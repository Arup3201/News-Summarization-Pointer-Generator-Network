A Pakistani teenage actress is in a critical condition in hospital after a man threw acid in her face while she was asleep at her family home.

Bushra Waiz, 18, was attacked in the early hours of Saturday morning, her brother said.

Her family said a man had proposed to Ms Waiz and hurled acid at her when she turned him down.
