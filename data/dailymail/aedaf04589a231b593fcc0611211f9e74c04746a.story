Australia's rising tennis star Nick Kyrgios has advanced into the fourth round of the Australian Open after defeating Tunisian Malek Jaziri in three eventful sets.

It was a bumpy ride for the 19-year-old who conquered through several nose bleeds and an arching back to claim a 6-3 7-6 (8-6) 6-1 victory over the world No.75 on Friday night.

'It's a great feeling. I haven't played too many matches so it feels great to get some wins, especially the home slam in front of such a great crowd,' Kyrgios said after the match.

'To everyone whose come and supported me. My family, my friends - you know, everyone whose helped, its been awesome coming back.'

Donning a fluorescent yellow and pink sporting gear on Margaret Court Arena, the Canberra teen was not the only one causing delays with Jaziri calling for an injury time out for courtside treatment.

Kyrgios was treated several times early on for nose bleeds and at one point, he needed stuffing to play on while Jaziri suffered a sore serving shoulder and a tightening groin.

'The back started tightening up a little bit but there's no problem with it,' Kyrgios said before joking with the crowd: 'I didn't want to scare everyone away when I took my shirt off.'

Powering through the third round at Melbourne Park, Kyrgios dashed off court for a back rub in a medical timeout at 4-1 in the third set but returned and plundered his 25th ace and closing the match after one hour and 58 minutes.

Kyrgios will take on Italian Andreas Seppi who defeated Swiss superstar Roger Federer in an upset four-set win  earlier on Friday.

'It was a massive upset for Seppi - he's obviously playing some really good tennis but you know it happens and it's a sport where upsets can happen. I watched the match and it was really really high-level,' Kyrgios said.

The match on Sunday would be a walk down memory lane for the pair, after Kyrgios took care of Seppi in straight sets in the second round in New York last year.

'He's an amazing character, an amazing guy. I respect him so much. I'm sure everybody respects Lleyton a lot.

'For me, if I hit with him tomorrow there's a big chance, a big opportunity.'

Hewitt was the last home-grown talent to advanced through to the finals a decade ago but was defeated by Russia's Marat Safin.

The 33-year-old was the first Australian to reach the final since Pat Cash in 1988.
