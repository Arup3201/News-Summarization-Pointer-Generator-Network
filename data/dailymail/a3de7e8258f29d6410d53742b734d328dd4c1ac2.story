A giant explosive cloud hanging over a North Sea rig could take six months to clear and may expand towards the Scottish coast, it was warned today.

The huge underwater reservoir tapped by oil giant Total's Elgin platform, which sits 150 miles from Aberdeen, is known as the 'well from hell' because it is so difficult to plug.

An exclusion zone stretching up to four miles has been set up around the platform because it could explode. 

The exact source of the leak is still a mystery but it is escaping out of the platform, which has pumped gas and oil to Britain for the past decade.

Total say they are 
considering a drilling relief well to divert the gas, which would be a safe way to end the crisis, but it could 
take up to six months.

The faster and riskier alternative of 
sending engineers onto the rig to 'kill' the leak is also on the table, but it would mean having workers at the centre of a potential disaster zone.

Total boss David Hainsworth said: 'The well itself could die on its own. This is the dream option.

'There are two options for intervening. One is drilling a relief well which could take about six months. The other is a platform intervention to kill the well.'

In the last two days hundreds of 
workers have also been evacuated off or away from the Elgin Total 
platform, which stands 150 miles from the Aberdeen coast.

Coastguards
have today demanded shipping stays at least two miles away, planes must
keep a distance of three miles, while rigs up to four miles away are 
being emptied in case they get caught up in any explosion.

'This is the well from hell,' said Frederic Hauge, head of Bellona, a leading Norwegian group that
closely monitors the oil industry.

'This problem is out of control and is only going to get bigger and bigger,' he added, saying the high pressure of the undersea reservoirs in the North Sea field made it especially hard to shut off.

It is also being reported the team of
Texan 'Hellfighters' who battled the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 
April 2010, which killed 11 and injured 16, is being brought to Scotland
by Total to prevent or tackle a blast.

The
incident in the Gulf of Mexico 
shocked the world and cost oil giant BP almost £5 billion in 
reparations, and anything on that scale would be unprecedented in 
Britain.

Fears have risen because the Total rig is now 
surrounded by a giant gas cloud, with a sheen of liquid gas on the water
- a tell-tale sign there is a large leak.

Total's shares dived about five percent today as it scrambled to present a strategy to deal with the leak.

David Hainsworth, health, safety and environment manager for the company, told the Good Morning Scotland programme that there are risks around the situation.

He said: 'The gas is flammable but the platform power was turned off to minimise risk of ignition, but clearly there is a risk.

'We have taken away a series of risks but there is always a possibility, it's low but you never say never.

'The best-case scenario is that the gas in this area is not very productive and it dies off in the coming days and weeks.

'At the moment there is no real evolution of the sheen on the sea but if that was to change - and it's monitored on a daily basis - then the exclusion zone may be increased, but at the moment it will probably stay the same.'

British officials said the gas, containing poisonous hydrogen sulphide - familiar from the smell of rotten eggs - should disperse in the atmosphere. But it poses a risk to anyone close to the source, making capping the well complex.

Poison in the gas could also threaten fish and other marine life nearby, although the rate at which it dissipates in air and water meant it was not a significant threat to people on land.

On Sunday all 238 staff were evacuated from the Elgin platform.

Shell has now removed 85 workers from its Shearwater platform and the nearby Noble Hans Deul drilling rig while the nearby leak is found and stopped, taking the total evacuated from the area to 323.

Drilling operations on its Noble Hans Deul rig have been suspended and the wells have been left in a safe state, Shell said.

'While the move is purely precautionary and primarily driven by the prevailing weather conditions, and both facilities remain operational, it has been decided to reduce numbers to a more manageable level until the full situation surrounding the Elgin leak has been established,' a Shell spokesman added.

They are removing 52 workers from Shearwater, leaving 38 on board, while 33 are being taken off the Hans Deul, leaving 79.

Evidence of the leak is believed to have emerged a few hours after staff had completed the closure of a well on Sunday.

But pressure began building up in the outer layers of the well, which led to bubbling on the surface of the sea.

Disaster: The Deepwater Horizon explosion killed and injured dozens, which is why hundreds have been evacuated from the Elgin platform and an exclusion zone set up

Total says it still does not know the cause of the leak and is taking 'all possible measures' to bring it under control.

But oil insiders say the gas leak on the Elgin platform is a ‘major, 
major problem’ and it is feared it could be coming directly from 
the reservoir and would be difficult to stop.

Investigators from Oil Spill Response (OSRL) yesterday carried out two 
aerial surveillance flights to assess the situation and two further 
flights are planned today.

There have been no reports of any injuries.

Total said it yesterday met the Secretary of State’s representative, the Health and Safety Executive, the Department of Energy and Climate change, Marine Scotland and the coastguard to discuss the problem.

The company said it has also mobilised experts from elsewhere in the Total Group to offer additional assistance and help deal with the incident.

'Total E&P UK confirms that the gas leak at the Elgin Well Head Platform remains ongoing, although the situation is currently stable,' a spokesman said.

'We continue to take all possible measures to try to identify the source and cause of the leak and to bring it under control.'

The leak on the Total platform comes after Chancellor George Osborne expressed his support for gas as a cheap and relatively clean fuel that would remain important for UK supplies, with measures to support new gas power stations.

He also announced £3 billion in tax breaks for deep water oil and gas exploration to the west of Shetland.

Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Paul Steedman said: 'Leaks like this make Osborne's dash for gas even more absurd - it could be months before it's sorted, posing a huge safety risk to workers and releasing a greenhouse gas 20 times more climate-wrecking than carbon dioxide.

'Gas is already pushing our fuel bills through the roof - now people will be wondering whether they'll be asked to cover the cost of the leak.

'It's time we shifted to clean and safe British energy from the wind, sun and sea - this, and slashing energy waste, is our best hope for affordable power.'
