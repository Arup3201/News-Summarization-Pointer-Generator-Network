Michelle Obama has made a passionate video appeal claiming the 2014 mid-term elections are more serious than both her husband's presidential wins.

With a beleaguered Barack Obama suffering from some of his lowest ever approval ratings, the First Lady is increasingly being seen as the Democrats' secret weapon in their desperate fight for Congress.

In the new video recorded to launch the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's 1millionvotesfor2014.com website, Mrs Obama tells party activists the mid-terms will be even closer than both the 2008 and 2012 campaigns.

Appeal: In a campaign video released today, Mrs Obama warns the upcoming mid-terms will be even tougher than her husband's two presidential wins

She says: 'When it comes to the midterm elections this November, we need you to be as passionate and as hungry as you were in 2008 and 2012.

'In fact, you need to be even more passionate and more hungry to get Democrats elected to Congress because these elections will be even hard and even closer than those presidential elections.

'we're talking about races that are won and lost by just a few thousand votes or even a few hundred votes.'

Concerns: The First Lady insists her husband has been working 'so hard' on issues such as equal pay for women, immigration reform and raising the minimum wage

The two-minute video, which was part of a
 fundraising email sent to donors on Sunday morning, is the First Lady's
 first major foray into campaigning on behalf of the Democrats.

Mrs Obama raises several key issues 
including equal pay for women, immigration reform, raising the minimum 
wage and 'ensuring that women can make their own decisions about their 
bodies and their health care'.

President Obama is said to have played 81 rounds of golf since the 2012 election

She adds: 'My husband is working so hard on all these issues but he needs leaders in Congress who will work with him, leaders who care about what's going on in your lives and who will fight for you every single day.'

Barack Obama, has faced widespread criticism in the press after it was alleged that he has played 81 rounds of golf since re-election – as many as he played in his entire first term.

He is said to have holed himself up in Washington where he attends fundraisers and dinners with celebrities rather than tackling the day-to-day business of congressional politics.

It has also been reported he has been spending a significant amount of time house hunting and has looked at buying a luxury £2.5 million mansion in a California compound dubbed the ‘Playground of the Presidents’.

The President is already seen as a lame duck due to the current deadlock on Capitol Hill and he could lose power entirely if the Republicans take control of the Senate as is widely expected.

He has long faced criticism that he has not dirtied his hands with the day-to-day business of Congressional politics and that this has contributed to the rancour which nearly brought about a government shutdown last year.

If the Republicans did take the Senate they would redouble their attempts to repeal his health care reform, the President’s signature piece of domestic legislation.
