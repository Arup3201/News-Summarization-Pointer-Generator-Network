Police have arrested Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf at his home where he had holed up following a dramatic escape from court to avoid detention, it emerged today.

Musharraf fled Islamabad High Court in a speeding vehicle yesterday after a judge rejected his bail and ordered his arrest in connection with a case involving his decision to fire senior judges while in power.

It was a new low in Musharraf's troubled return from self-imposed exile last month to make a political comeback in the upcoming parliamentary election.

Police say they arrested Musharraf overnight and presented him before a judge at Islamabad District Court this morning.

Drama: Pakistan's former President Pervez Musharraf fled an Islamabad courthouse yesterday to avoid arrest, but has now been held by police at his home

The former President fled at such a speed yesterday, one of his security detail was left clinging to the outside off the car as it sped off

Local TV footage showed Musharraf entering district court in Islamabad amid a heavy security detachment of police and paramilitary soldiers.

The district court judge instructed police to keep Musharraf in their custody for two days and then present him before an anti-terrorism court, said one of his lawyers, Malik Qamar Afzal.

Officials have declared Musharraf's home on the outskirts of Islamabad a jail, which is allowed under the country's law, and he will be held there under house arrest.

Musharraf's legal team has said they will challenge the arrest order in the Supreme Court later.

Yesterday Musharraf was on the run after fleeing a court in the country's capital to avoid arrest after his bail was revoked, police said.

Officers were deployed at the court building in Islamabad but Musharraf's security team rushed him out and put him in a black pick-up truck before they could detain him.

The court rejected his bail in a case related to his decision to suspend the constitution and declare a state of emergency in 2007, police spokesman Ali Asghar said.

A spokeswoman for Musharraf, Saima Ali Dada, said his legal team is trying to decide the next move.

Formerly one of Pakistan's most powerful politicians after seizing power in a 1999 coup, Pervez Musharraf went from Pakistan President to self-imposed exile.

During his tenure in charge of the country, which ended in 2008, he survived numerous attempts on his life.

The turning point of his time in charge came after the 9/11 terror attack in 2001. He supported America's 'War on Terror', which proved hugely unpopular in Pakistan.

In a bid to crush militants who supported Al Qaeda, he ordered his security forces to lay siege to the Red Mosque and its Islamic school in Islamabad, which was said to be campaigning to enforce Sharia law. More than 100 people were killed.

In the aftermath, Islamist militants began a campaign of suicide bombings and Musharraf fled the country in 2008, returning last month to participate in elections.

His time in power was also marked by 
struggles with the judiciary, including an attempt to remove the chief 
justice in 2007 - for which he faces treason charges - and clashes over his bid to remain 
head of the army while still president.

He attempted to appease the West by aiding the 'War on Terror' but managed to further anger militants within Pakistan... while the West criticised his dedication to fighting Al Qaeda.

Musharraf was also accused of not doing enough to protect 
former PM Benazir Bhutto from being assassinated in 2007, despite 
allegedly being aware of Taliban plans to kill her.

It followed accusations that he was indirectly responsible for the death of Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, a Baloch nationalist leader killed in an army operation the year before.

Local television broadcast footage of Musharraf jumping into a black SUV and escaping as a member of his security team clung to the outside of the vehicle.  Meanwhile lawyers shouted 'Look who is running, Musharraf is running!'

He sped away to his large compound on the outskirts of Islamabad that is protected by high walls, razor wire and guard towers.

This week has gone from bad to worse for Musharraf, who seized power in a coup in 1999 when he was serving as army chief and spent nearly a decade in power before being forced to step down in 2008.

He returned last month after four years in self-imposed exile in Britain to make a political comeback despite legal challenges and Taliban death threats, but has since faced paltry public support.

A court in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Tuesday disqualified Musharraf from running in the parliamentary election scheduled for May 11, likely squashing his hopes for political comeback.

The case before the Islamabad High 
Court  today involved Musharraf's decision in 2007 to detain senior 
judges, including the chief justice of the Supreme Court, when he 
declared a state of emergency and suspended the constitution.

The
decision outraged many Pakistanis, and further fueled a nationwide 
protest movement by lawyers that eventually resulted in Musharraf 
stepping down under the threat of impeachment.

Before he returned to the country, 
Musharraf obtained pre-arrest bail for the judges' case and two others, 
meaning he could not be arrested when he landed - a feature of 
Pakistan's legal system.

The Islamabad High Court refused to extend that bail today and ordered his arrest, said police officer Ali Asghar.

The court previously agreed to extend 
his bail in the case for six days on April 12.

It's unclear why they 
chose to reject it this time.

Despite crowds of people, including police officers with the power to arrest him, Musharraf managed to escape to his compound

Musharraf's lawyer, Ahmad Raza Kasuri, 
complained that the court didn't listen to their arguments, saying: 'It 
is a one-sided decision' that he would challenge.

Musharraf's decision to flee the court could put the Pakistani army in an awkward situation.

The former general is protected by paramilitary soldiers who officially report to the Interior Ministry, but are headed by senior army officers.

Ali Dayan Hasan, the director of Human Rights Watch in Pakistan, called on the military authorities protecting Musharraf to comply with the court's order and ensure that he presents himself for arrest.

'General Musharraf's act today underscores his disregard for due legal process and indicates his assumption that as a former army chief and military dictator he can evade accountability for abuses,' said Hasan in a statement sent to reporters.

'Continued military protection for General Musharraf will make a mockery of claims that Pakistan's armed forces support the rule of law and bring the military further disrepute that it can ill afford,' Hasan said.

Pakistan has a long history of the army seizing power in military coups, and the service is considered the most powerful institution in the country.

If convicted of treason, Musharraf could face the death penalty or life in prison. But the federal government would have to file charges against the former military ruler, which it has not yet done.

The petitions in Islamabad High Court accusing Musharraf of treason were all filed by individuals.

Musharraf faces similar accusations from petitions filed before the Supreme Court. He also faces legal charges in two other cases.
