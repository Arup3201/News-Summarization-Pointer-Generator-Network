A polar bear received a frosty reception after it wandered into the territory of a hot headed rival.

The two bears came to blows in Hudson Bay, Canada, in an early more land-grab. 

The brawling bears were captured jabbing and clawing at each other's bodies in an attempt to exert their dominance on each other.

Russia wildlife photographer Alexey Tishchenko couldn't believe his eyes when the fight erupted in front of him. 

He then spent the next ten minutes watching the two half-a-ton beasts crash into one another as the sun's rays reflected off their fur.

Mr Tishchenko said: 'I couldn't believe my eyes because it was such a strange sight as the sun light on the bear's fur made it look like they were red with anger towards each other.

'A lot of the time capturing shots like this is a matter of being in the right place at the right time and luckily for me I was there with my camera ready to shoot.

'It's quite surreal to see the pictures now because the reddish lighting makes them look particularly arty.

'They are incredibly strong animals, I don't think the rival had it in him to finish the fight and eventually wandered off.'
