The number of places where mobile phone users receive a patchy signal is to be halved after the Government struck a deal with networks.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said the legally binding agreement would require all four main mobile operators to increase places with full signals from 69 per cent to 85 per cent of geographic areas by 2017.

It will mean the firms are required to make a £5billion investment to improve infrastructure – with more masts and sharing between operators.  

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said the deal 'will give the UK the world-class mobile phone coverage it needs'

Mr Javid said the agreement, which will be policed by regulator Ofcom, will mean Britain having some of the best coverage of any major European country.

He had threatened to change the law to introduce a system of ‘national roaming’ that would allow phone users to hop between different networks unless the companies agreed to end the scandal of signal blackspots.

Currently, poor coverage leaves millions unable to make calls or receive data. Campaigners complain that in parts of the country, reception is worse than in India and Malawi.

So-called ‘not-spots’, where there is no signal at all, are mostly in remote, rural communities. Partial not-spots, where one provider might provide a signal, but others do not, are much more widespread – affecting more than a fifth of the country in terms of geography.

Prime Minister David Cameron is understood to have become increasingly frustrated by dropped calls in his Witney constituency – and also in Downing Street, which is a notorious mobile phone blackspot even though it is in the heart of the capital.

The agreement struck last night by Mr Javid will mean cutting total not-spots, where there is currently no mobile coverage, by two-thirds. The number of partial not-spots will come down by a half, the Government says.

No cash payments will be made by Government to the mobile networks as part of the agreement, but officials concede that Ofcom may decide to cut the annual licence fees paid by mobile networks as a result of their new obligations.

Ministers have also announced a £150 million programme to help take mobile coverage to the areas of the UK that have no coverage at all.

Government buildings will also be offered as sites for new mobile phone masts – potentially opening up hundreds of locations to in areas where is has been previously difficult to roll out network coverage.

Mr Javid said: ‘I am pleased to have secured a legally binding deal with the four mobile networks. Too many parts of the UK regularly suffer from poor mobile coverage leaving them unable to make calls or send texts.

‘Government and businesses have been clear about the importance of mobile connectivity, and improved coverage, so this legally binding agreement will give the UK the world-class mobile phone coverage it needs and deserves. The £5bn investment from the mobile networks in the UK’s infrastructure will help drive this Government’s long-term economic plan.’

EE CEO Olaf Swantee said: ‘EE is focused on bringing the best voice and data service to its customers across the UK, and only last week announced 1,500 unconnected villages will soon benefit from EE coverage. This agreement ensures that our customers are able to stay connected in even more places up and down the country.’

Derek McManus, chief operating officer of O2, said: ‘A partnership between government and the mobile operators is required to maximise coverage across the UK, so this agreement is a good outcome for our customers. It will support investment in our network, while ensuring that strong competition remains between the different networks.’

The Federation of Small Businesses found 71 per cent of firms rated mobile phones as crucial or very important to their business. Some 51 per cent said their staff had a problem with mobile coverage very or quite often.
