It is said that there’s no such thing as a free lunch, but even if you manage to bag a bargain meal, it will not taste as good as a more expensive option, according to scientists.

A new study has found that restaurant goers who pay more for their meals think the food is tastier than if it is offered for a smaller price.

The experts think that people tend to associate cost with quality and this changes their perception of how food tastes.

People who paid $8 instead of $4 for a buffet enjoyed their meal 11 per cent more than those who ate the cheaper food.

Those that paid for the $4 (£2.40) buffet said felt guiltier about loading up their plates and felt that they over ate.

However, the scientists said that both groups ate around the same quantity of food in total.

In another experiment, scientists found that people who eat in dim lighting consume 175 less calories than people who eat in brightly lit areas.

Scientists at Cornell University in New York studied the eating habits of 139 people enjoying an Italian buffet in an upstate restaurant.

The price of the food was set by the researchers at either $4 (£2.40) or $8 (£4.70) for the all-you-can-eat meal.

Customers were asked to rate how good the food tasted, the quality of the restaurant and to leave their names.

The experiment revealed that the people who paid $8 (£4.70) for the food enjoyed their meal 11 per cent more than those who ate the ‘cheaper’ buffet.

Interestingly those that paid for the $4 (£2.40) buffet said they felt guiltier about loading up their plates and felt that they over ate.

However, the scientists said that both groups ate around the same quantity of food in total, according to the study presented at the Experimental Biology 2014 meeting this week.

Brian Wansink, a professor of consumer behaviour at the university, said: ‘We were fascinated to find that pricing has little impact on how much one eats, but a huge impact on how you interpret the experience.’

He thinks that people enjoyed their food more as they associated cost with quality and that small alterations to a restaurant can change how tasty people find their meals.

In a previous study, researchers from the university showed that people who eat in dim lighting consume 175 less calories than people who eat in brightly lit areas.
