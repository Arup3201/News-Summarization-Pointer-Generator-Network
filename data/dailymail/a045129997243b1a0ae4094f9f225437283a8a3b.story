When the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889 it became the tallest man-made structure in the world as well as a global cultural icon.

It also became a source of jealousy in London, where architects immediately started drawing up plans to rival and outdo the Parisian landmark.

Newly uncovered documents reveal an intense competition was held to find a design for what was to be called the Great Tower of London.

Landmark: The winning design, by Stewart, Maclaren 
and Dunn, right, looks similar to the Eiffel Tower. The winners received a prize of 500 guineas and according to documents was
 215 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower

The winning entry was to be built in Wembley Park, North West London and was intended to be a centerpiece of a new funfair.

However the building of the ambitious 
octagonal structure hit a stumbling block as the project ran out of 
money after only completing the first floor.

These pictures show the amazing designs that were submitted by 68 talented architects that were published in a catalogue.

Rivalry: The runner up in the competition, left, won 250 Guineas. There was intense competition for the design of what was to be called 
the Great Tower of London and 68 architects entered designs

Original? One design, left, looks like a helter skelter. The winning entry was to be built in Wembley Park, London

Some look like carbon copies of the Eiffel Tower itself, while others resemble bizarre structures of the future.

One drawing is even similar to a helter skelter and another mirrors the shape of a drill.

The winning design, by Stewart, Maclaren and Dunn, received a prize of 500 guineas and according to documents was 215 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower.

Unusual: This design on the right looks like the eye-catching Shard that's just been built at London Bridge

Copying? These designs still resemble the Eiffel Tower. The winning design was 180ft taller than the Shard

It would also have been 180 feet taller than the Shard, which is the tallest building in Europe.

Just like the second placed tower, it bears a strong similarity to the Eiffel Tower.

The Eiffel Tower was subsidised by the French government, whereas the bill for the Great Tower of London was footed completely by the British firm, Tower Company, which held the design competition.

Forty seven metres of the winning design was built before it was demolished and Wembley Stadium built

The fun fair was opened to the public in 1896 before the ill-fated attraction, still only 47 metres high, was demolished in 1907 after problems with shifting foundations.

It became known as the Watkins Folly or The London Stump and Wembley Stadium was built over the top of it for the 1923  British Empire Exhibition.

When the stadium was rebuilt 12 years ago the concrete foundations of the tower were rediscovered.

Problems: Money ran out to build the winning design. The entry on the right looks much like a drill

Paris's Eiffel Tower was built in 
1889 by Gustave Eiffel, and was originally the entrance arch to that 
year’s Universal Exposition– a world fair celebrating Gallic 
engineering.

At first it was criticised as a blot 
on the landscape, with writers Alexandre Dumas and Guy de Maupassant 
among those complaining about the ‘odious column built up of riveted 
iron plates.’

But it was soon revered as a striking
 piece of modern structural art, and is now the most popular tourist 
attraction in the world with an entrance fee.

It is by far the most prominent 
symbol of Paris, and indeed of French culture, featuring in countless 
films, documentaries, photographs and paintings.

Eiffel originally had a permit to 
allow his tower to stand for 20 years, but it avoided being demolished 
after becoming a valuable communication beacon during the First World 
War
