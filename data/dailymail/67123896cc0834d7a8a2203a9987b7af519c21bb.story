A Florida man won his unusual slip-and-fall case against retail giant Walmart on Wednesday and was awarded nearly $1.3 million.

Tom Papakalodoukas, 41, fell on a sign that was lying on the floor while shopping at a store in Port St. Lucie on May 15, 2011.

He slipped violently, ripping his right biceps tendon. The man was left facing huge medical bills, a string of operations and lifelong problem known as a 'Popeye deformity' - an abnormally bulging arm.

Papakalodoukas was carrying bottles of water when he walked over a Gatorade sign that had fallen from a display. The sign moved under him and sent him crashing to the floor.

He endured three surgeries in two years in attempts repair the damage. This included the transplantation of an Achilles tendon from a cadaver.

Papakalodoukas racked up more than $200,000 in medical bills.

But he has been left with a malformed, bulging biceps tendon for the rest of his life. He has also been unable to return to his job as a distribution manager at a drinks company.

According to WPTV.com, his attorney, Gloria Seidule, also claims that Papakalodoukas has suffered from depression since the incident.

Surveillance footage recorded the Gatorade sign falling and Papakalodoukas slipping on it minutes later. Store employees then discarded the display.

At the circuit court in St. Lucie County, Walmart claimed that the sign had properly assembled and maintained.

The company contended that Gatorade was to blame for providing easily breakable plastic screws that held the sign to the the display.

WPTV.com reported that Walmart denied negligence, claiming that its employees did not have time to remove the fallen sign before Papakalodoukas fell.

Seidule argued against Walmart using 
evidence from Gatorade. This claimed that if the display had been put 
together in accordance with Gatorade's instructions the sign could not 
have fallen.

Gatorade added that if the screws did snap, the maintenance of the sign was Walmart's responsibility.

Tom Papakalodoukas was shopping at this Walmart in Port St. Lucie, Florida, when he slipped on the fallen sign. This week he was awarded $1.3 million in damages

The all-female jury deliberated for four hours before concluding that Walmart was 90 per cent at fault and awarding Papakalodoukas $1,287,144.

According to WPBF.com, Seidule only claimed for $600,000 in damages.

Responding to the size of the award, the attorney stated: 'The jury assessed the existing and future medical expenses and lost wages when determining the monetary value of the case.'

As reported by WPBF, Seidule added: 'We are very grateful for a jury system in this country that will allow a small local lawfirm like mine and an individual to be able to level the playing field and come in and have a fair trial against a large corporation like Walmart.'

Papakalodoukas said: 'It's tough. I just try to take it day by day. Hopefully, I'll heal this time and get my life back together.'
