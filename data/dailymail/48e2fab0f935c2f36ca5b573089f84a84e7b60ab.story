A man became so angry during a game of basketball that he was captured on camera body slamming a teacher. 

The game in the Florida's Holly Hill school gym started out as a friendly competition between special education teacher Katherine Martin, two students, and campus adviser Travis Mims. 

But Mims, 27, was so enraged by a foul that when Martin tried to push away from him to get open for a pass he lifted her off the floor and slammed her back down to the court.

Travis Mims has been arrested on aggravated battery charges after the assault was caught on camera

Mims was arrested and charged with aggravated battery the next day.

'That's above and beyond,' Holly Hill Police Chief Stephen Aldrich said, according to Fox News. 'He pics her up, and he just turns her over and drops her on the floor from probably 5 (or) 6 feet in the air. So she hit real hard.'

Martin had substantial injuries from the assault forcing her to look for medical treatment.

Other adults had to intervene and force Mims off. 

'In our view, it was intentional,' Aldrich said. 'There's certain things you don't do even when you're playing ball.'

Mims is no longer employed by the school.
