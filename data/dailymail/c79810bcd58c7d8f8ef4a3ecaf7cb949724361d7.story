A horrifying video shows the moment a woman police officer beats a suspect repeatedly with a baton.

The man, who had allegedly threatened a Sacramento shop assistant, later died in police custody.

Officers had been called to the city's Metro PCS store in Folsom Boulevard on Friday, after reports that a shop assistant was in danger.

As they tried to handcuff the suspect, who had tried to barricade himself inside the store, the man resisted and a violent struggle followed.

A shopper, who sent her footage to CBS13 under the condition of anonymity, filmed the moment the man was 
held to the ground as a police officer struck him 
repeatedly with her baton.

Officer Doug Morse called for more witnesses who may have filmed the incident to send in the footage to help the investigation.

By the time the suspect, a white man in his 40s, had been restrained and taken into custody, he had stopped breathing. He was rushed to hospital, but later died.

One of the police officers and off-duty district attorney investigator who had stopped to help, were also taken to hospital needing treatment, according to a police report.

The coroner has not listed the official cause of death for the suspect, who has not been identified.

Witnesses say that shoppers had tried
 to come to the aid of the police, who had called for back up as they 
struggled to subdue the man.

The arrest took place after a shop 
assistant called police at about 5.45pm, fearing that her life was in 
danger. She reported that a man had come into the shop and started 
talking incoherently.

He was outside when police arrived, but quickly went back in the store and tried to block the door.

In a tweet sent at 11.57pm it said: 'SPD investigating an in custody death after officers physically struggle with a violent suspect.'
