It was about 6pm Thursday and Krystine Rivera was out running near her home in Ashburn, Virginia, following a bad day at work.

A keen marathon runner, the 27-year-old administrative analyst figured some exercise would help make her feel better but, little did she know, about five miles into her seven mile run, she would be involved in an accident she was lucky to survive.

A deer that had walked out in front of an SUV being driven by a 71-year-old woman was flung in the air and came crashing down on an unsuspecting Rivera, who was knocked out on impact.

Krystine Rivera, a keen marathon runner, sustained injuries to her head and right knee following the accident on Thursday

According to the Washington Post, Rivera came to in the ambulance as a paramedic told her they were cutting away her favorite running shirt because it was covered in deer blood.

'That's when I knew a deer was part of this,' she said.

The buck died at the scene.

The driver was treated at Inova Loudoun Hospital and released a short time later, according to the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office.

Rivera, who was taken to the same hospital and also released Thursday evening, suffered a concussion, a cut to her scalp and a bruise to her right knee.

'My whole right side hurts,' she told The Post.

At barely five feet tall, Rivera is lucky to be alive.

'I was running, then I was on the ground and then was listening to the paramedic,' she said.

'I’m surprised I made it out alive.'

Rivera has been running for about five years.

'I’d thought that the run would make me feel better after work,' she said.

A female passerby called 911 and used Rivera’s phone to dial numbers that reached Rivera’s boyfriend and her family.

The 71-year-old female driver of the Toyota SUV - similar to this one - involved in the accident was also hospitalized, but released a short time after

'I want to really thank her, whoever she was. And I am glad the driver is all right.'

Surprisingly, Rivera remains unperturbed by the accident and said she will run the same path again.

Her sister, Shannon Rivera, posted on Facebook that her sibling was 'hardcore'.

'My sister, the survivor of flying deer. Most hardcore sister to have,' she wrote. 

Barely five feet tall, Rivera already had been jokingly nicknamed 'The Hulk' by her friends.

'I guess now they can really call me that,' she said.

Andrew Disilvestre, whose home backs up to the path where Rivera was running, noticed what he thought looked like a single car accident on his way home Thursday night.

Then, on Friday morning, something else caught his eye out his back window.

'I noticed some big vultures flying around and noticed a dead deer,' said Disilvestre.

News4 told him that the deer had hit a jogger before it fell to the ground.

'It's certainly an anomaly... that's a surprise,' said Disilvestre.

'I might look out for deer next time I'm jogging.'

Virginia is a major deer-hunting state.

In the 2010 hunting season, more than 5,700 deer were recorded as being killed.

While residents say they are well-versed in vehicle accidents involving the animal, the story of a flying deer hitting a passer-by was a first.

'That' pretty amazing,' said Michael Valmont, who works out at a gym near the accident scene.

'I don't know what the statistics are for that but it's pretty low.'
