Police texted a bike thief demanding he hand himself in before calling his mobile phone, only to be told by the teenager: ‘Come and find me - peace out’.

Drug user Axl Parker, 19, had been raiding his downstairs neighbours’ sheds in Ramsgate, Kent, before one of them told officers she thought he was the culprit, a court heard.

The neighbour, Claire Bain, told police about a Facebook picture of Parker with an optic - used for serving measures of spirits - hanging up behind him, which had gone missing from her shed.

Police officers went to arrest Parker at his home but he was not there, Canterbury Crown Court was told.

However Parker then posted a text message, sent to him by police, on Facebook - and it read: ‘Axl its (sic) Heidi from the police stn, im working today and can deal with u if u r ready 2 come in’.

He wrote on Facebook in response: ‘Margate police no they can’t catch me lol’, before police called him to say they needed to talk - but he replied: ‘Come and find me - peace out’, then hung up.

Parker was arrested soon after at his home - just upstairs from two of the six sheds he had raided for bikes, a leaf blower, tools and the optic, the court heard.

When police raided Parker’s home they found the stolen items. This was after neighbours had been discussing who the culprit could be and came up with Parker’s name, Jim Harvey, prosecuting, said.

He told the court: ‘She (Claire Bain) went onto Facebook to his page and on his profile picture, in the background she saw an optic which had been stolen from her shed.’

Contact: Parker posted a text message, sent to him by police, on Facebook - and it read as above

The case began when neighbour Tracy Adams alerted cops that her shed had been broken into and her 11-year-old son’s bicycle had been stolen in March this year.

She told officers that Parker’s bedroom overlooked her garden and that she was sure he was the culprit. Miss Bain also realised her shed had been broken into and spoke to other neighbours.

Miss Bain - upon checking Parker’s Facebook page - found him posing in a picture with the stolen optic hanging up behind him, although the photo has now been deleted.

She alerted police that she had ‘found evidence’ and officers set about arresting Parker. Police initially turned up at his house to arrest him but found that he wasn’t home in March this year.

A statement from Ms Adams, read in court, said: ‘How can you tell your 11-year-old son that his bike is stolen? He has been greatly affected.

Reply: He wrote on Facebook in response: 'Margate police no they can't catch me lol', before police called him to say they needed to talk - but he replied: 'Come and find me - peace out', then hung up

‘His bedroom overlooks the garden and he no longer wants to sleep there in case this man comes back.’

'I wonder if you ever stop and think about that 11-year-old boy or wondered how it feels to have your bike stolen. Or think about the widow whose late husband’s tools you took? How low does it get?'

Judge James O’Mahony

Judge James O’Mahony, who heard how Parker was addicted to drugs, said that cocaine turned people into ‘low, nasty thieves who steal children’s bikes’.

He told Parker: ‘I wonder if you ever stop and think about that 11-year-old boy or wondered how it feels to have your bike stolen. Or think about the widow whose late husband’s tools you took? How low does it get?’

Parker, who admitted theft, was handed a three-month jail sentence - suspended for two years - and ordered to take a six-month programme to deal with his drugs habit.
