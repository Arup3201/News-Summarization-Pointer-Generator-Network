He apparently had surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle, so perhaps Kim Jong-un was searching for more comfortable footwear.

Or maybe he was picking out a colourful pair of heels for his good lady.

Whatever the reason for his latest 'field guidance' visit, the North Korean leader was paying very close attention at a shoe factory this week.

Accompanied by his usual phalanx of staff who were furiously taking notes, Kim surveyed a vast array of footwear from baby wellington boots to bright-yellow sandals.

Pictures released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency today show him scouring rows of shoes, stopping at times to discuss different styles.

He is later seen waving to a crowd of workers outside the Ryuwon Shoes Factory in the capital Pyongyang. 

A foot condition was last year mooted as a possible reason for his mystery six-week public absence.

A South Korean spy agency claimed the North Korean leader was having a cyst removed from his ankle.

Kim disappeared on September 3, leading to a frenzy of wild speculation - including suggestions he had been overthrown, had died of a heart attack, was suffering a mental breakdown or was having a gastric band fitted to help him overcome a crippling addiction to Emmental cheese.

He reappeared in public on October 14 looking slightly slimmer and walking with the aid of a cane. 

Kim's visit to the shoe factory came as Russia said it had received a positive initial signal from North Korea after President Vladimir Putin invited its leader Kim Jong Un to attend anniversary celebrations of the Soviet victory over Germany in World War Two.

The trip would be Kim's first foreign visit since taking the helm of the reclusive east Asian state in 2011.

Moscow and Pyongyang are looking to boost ties and North Korea is seeking support from Russia against international criticism over accusations of human rights abuses.

Asked at a news conference on Wednesday about Pyongyang's response to the Russian invitation, Lavrov replied: 'The first signal was positive'. He did not elaborate.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last month that Kim had been invited to the World War Two victory anniversary which Russia marks every year on May 9.

The U.N. General Assembly committee dealing with human rights passed a resolution last month calling for the Security Council to consider referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity.

Russia, as a permanent veto-wielding member of the Security Council, has the power to strike down any such move.

Moscow also needs Pyongyang co-operation in boosting natural gas exports to South Korea as Gazprom wants to build a gas pipeline through North Korea to reach its southern neighbour.

Lavrov has previously said North Korea is ready to resume stalled international talks on its nuclear programme.

North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia and the United States began talks in 2003 to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons, but they were suspended after Pyongyang tested nuclear devices in 2006 and 2009.
