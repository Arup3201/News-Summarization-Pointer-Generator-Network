Didier Drogba is not concerned if Chelsea lose 10 Premier League games this season - provided they win the title when it is all over.

The Blues' storming start to the campaign led many to believe they could replicate Arsenal's 'Invincibles' who went the entire 2003-04 season unbeaten. However, Drogba is not bothered after those hopes were ended by defeat at Newcastle in their last away game.

He told the Evening Standard: 'We just want to be top of the League, to win the League. Even if we lose five or 10 games and win the League, for me it's a very good season.

Drogba, who won three titles during his first spell at the club, was brought back to Stamford Bridge on a free transfer by Jose Mourinho - and the Ivorian insists the relationship between the pair is as strong as ever.

He said: 'To be in Chelsea with him (Mourinho) is really special. He trusts me and I try to give things back when I am on the pitch. Even outside in the dressing room with everyone, we have a good spirit.'

Chelsea travel to Stoke on Monday night having seen their eight-point lead over Manchester City reduced to three points - and could begin the match on level terms if the reigning champions defeat Crystal Palace on Saturday.

Drogba is set to return from an ankle injury but new £32million signing Diego Costa is expected to lead the line, with the 36-year-old admitting  the  Spain international's form could be crucial in deciding the title race while defending criticism over the striker's physical approach.

'He had a very good start and we are here to help him improve, to continue to keep his record because we need him to score goals. He is an important man in our team.' 

'A bit like with me, people forget that technically he's gifted,' he said. 'He can play good football.

'I think it's a bit unfair to say he is a physical player. I think his technique is great and he can score fantastic goals. He is a complete striker.'
