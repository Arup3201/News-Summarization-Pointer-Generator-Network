Working couple: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and wife Miriam who have three sons

Parental leave rules are to be torn up to smash the ‘old-fashioned assumption’ that women rather than men should stay at home to look after young children.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will today unveil plans to allow new mothers and fathers to share leave – meaning men will be able to take almost a year off work.

Mr Clegg, who took an extended period of paternity leave when his first son was born,  said the current system, which means a father can only take a fortnight off after the birth of a child, was ‘Edwardian’.

His wife Miriam returned to work first, but admitted she relied on an army of helpers ‘making my life possible’.

The proposals have been the subject of a fierce Coalition argument and have split the business community.

The
Institute of Directors condemned them as a ‘nightmare for small 
businesses’ but the Confederation of British Industry said it was 
pleased the Government had listened to concerns about the system. 

Mr
Clegg’s plans will anger some Conservatives, who argue firms cannot be 
expected to cope with more rights for employees as the economy comes out
of recession.

From April 
2015, parents will be able to share 52 weeks of leave. New mothers will 
have to use the first two weeks, deemed important for recovery and 
bonding with their baby.

But they will be able to transfer the rest of the time off to their partner – meaning he can tell his employer he wants as many as 50 weeks off.

Alternatively, parents could each take 25 weeks concurrently – or opt for one to take a period of time off and then the other.

But Tories have insisted that businesses have the right to make parents take leave in a continuous stretch if they deem coming and going over the year is too disruptive.

The right to shared leave will only apply to couples who both work.

The first 39 weeks of shared leave will be paid at the statutory minimum, with the last 13 weeks unpaid. Fathers will be guaranteed the right to return to the same job after up to 26 weeks off, but could be offered a different, equivalent post if they are away for longer.

An employee will be required to give their employer eight weeks’ notice of their intention to take leave. There will be a cap on requesting separate blocks of time off – at three per employee.

Ministers say the measures will offer flexibility to modern families where women are as likely as men to be the main breadwinner.

Mr Clegg argued that the new system will drive a ‘real cultural shift’, reducing the impact of pregnancy on women’s careers and helping working fathers play a greater role in childcare. 

When his eldest son Antonio, 11, was born in 2002, the Lib Dem leader took an extended period of paternity leave so wife Miriam could return to work first.

He took two weeks’ paternity leave after the birth of son Miguel, in 2009 and also when Alberto, eight, was born. 

But his wife has previously revealed that she has an army of helpers to enable the family to juggle work and childcare.

Mrs Clegg said she was able to rely on ‘a lot of shadows behind me making my life possible’, including a nanny ‘who is almost like my aunt and gives me orders’.

The Deputy Prime Minister said:  ‘Women deserve the right to pursue their goals and not feel they have to choose between having a successful career or having a baby.

'They should be supported by their employers, rather than being made to feel less employable or under pressure to take unchallenging jobs.’ 

He added: ‘We need to challenge the old-fashioned assumption that women will always be the parent that stays at home – many fathers want that option too.’ 

Mr Clegg condemned existing ‘outdated Edwardian parental leave laws’, adding that ‘the whole economy is suffering because we’re not giving women more opportunities to combine family and work’.

Alexander Ehmann, of the Institute of Directors, said the proposals heaped ‘yet more burdens on struggling employers at a time when government should be freeing them to create jobs and wealth’.

‘The proposed system is considerably more complex and unwieldy … and employers will, once again, have to absorb the cost of adapting and implementing this new system,’ he added. 

The TUC’s Frances O’Grady warned that unless leave is backed up with better pay ‘couples simply won’t be able to afford to take it’.
