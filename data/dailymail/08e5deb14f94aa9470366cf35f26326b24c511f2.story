Pigs which are shot at and blown up for training into battlefield injuries are treated ‘humanely’, a defence minister has claimed.

Philip Dunne refused to ban the tests which have seen scores of animals blown up in the last three three years.

Animal rights groups have condemned the exercises and insisted modern alternatives could be found, but Mr Dunne insisted nothing was as realistic as using the ‘live pig models’.

Training: The Ministry of Defence has defended its involvement in the 'cruel' practice of blowing up pigs

Last month it was revealed that more than 100 pigs have been blown up in Britain over a three-year period for research into battlefield injuries

Figures released last month showed 115 pigs have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts.

In one test a group of farm animals were put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in Porton Down, Wiltshire.

Green MP Caroline Lucas called on the Ministry of Defence to ‘abandon the use of live pigs in military battlefield exercises’.

She urged the government to hold talks with Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland ‘to learn from their use of mannequins as a replacement’.

Defence minister Philip Dunne said there was no alternative to the experience surgeons get from treating live pigs

But ministers insist the exercise are the only way to replicate the injuries soldiers sustain on the frontline, in order to give military medics training in how to treat horrific wounds.

Responding to a parliamentary question, Mr Dunne said: ‘As a key element in their training for operational deployment, members of the UK Defence Medical Services attend military Exercise Surgical Training courses in Denmark.

‘These exercises are essential to ensure our medical personnel are capable of carrying out potentially life-saving surgery on casualties with serious bullet and blast wounds.

‘Injuries of such severity are not routinely encountered during their clinical practice in NHS hospitals, but they are regularly required to treat them when on operational deployment. Participating in Danish training minimises the number of animals involved.

‘The pigs are treated humanely with full use of anaesthetics. There are a number of sophisticated simulation models on the market that provide effective training in certain surgical techniques, and the Ministry of Defence already uses these where clinically appropriate.

‘However, none of those currently available provide a viable alternative to the serious bullet and blast wound training that our surgeons receive from live pig models.’

According to latest figures, some
 21 pigs were blown up in 2010, 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012.

Animal 
welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has 
urged the military to stop the practice.

The
 group said that more than 80 per cent of Britain’s allies in the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) - including 20 EU member states - no
 longer train military medical personnel using animals.

A
 spokesman said: ‘To shoot, stab or blow up live pigs in 
order to train our military medics makes as much sense as conducting 
modern warfare with muskets.

‘Vastly
 superior non-animal trauma training methods, including life-like 
human-patient simulators, are available and used by the militaries of 23
 of the UK's 27 Nato allies.

‘It's
 time for the military to end its participation in these inhumane and 
ill-conceived exercises for the sake of both our fighting forces and 
animals.’

The MoD has killed 28,000 animals in 
various tests over the last three years, and the use of animals in 
military experiments in Britain is legal.
