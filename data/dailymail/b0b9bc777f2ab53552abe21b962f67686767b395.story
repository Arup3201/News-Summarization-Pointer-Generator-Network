Bobbi Kristina Brown's organs are shutting down and it doesn't matter if Bobby Brown takes her off life support at this point, it has been reported.

Family sources told TMZ that the family has come to accept that Bobby Kristina is dying but her distraught relatives are still trying to figure out what to do.

Bobbi Kristina has been in a medically induced coma since she was taken into the hospital two weeks ago and her brain activity has been minimal.

The daughter of the late Whitney Houston and singer Bobby Brown showed a glimmer of hope a few days later as her brain function improved, but her condition has since deteriorated.

Yet, despite her troubling outlook Bobby Brown is allegedly holding on to his strong religious views and is saying he will do what it takes to keep his daughter alive.

Brown appears ready to keep Krissy, as she is known to her family and friends, on life support, even if she has no hope of ever making a full recovery.

And while some members of the family think that Krissy should be taken off life support, they reportedly respect Brown's decision to help her fight for her life, sources told the gossip site.

It's been a difficult time for the Brown family and everyone connected to Bobbi Kristina.

Earlier this week, the messy row between her boyfriend Nick Gordon and her family continued, amid claims Nick Gordon has not made any attempt to visit his 21-year-old girlfriend in hospital. 

According to TMZ, Gordon, 25 claims he has been barred from seeing Bobbi Kristina and has hired a lawyer.

But the family said that he has avoided Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where the daughter of Whitney Houston has been on life support since January 31.

Gordon was in their Roswell home when a friend, Maxwell Lomas, 24, found Bobbi Kristina face-down in the bathtub unresponsive.

Gordon allegedly staged an appearance 'for the cameras' outside the hospital after Bobbi Kristina was admitted, but never actually went inside, the website reported. 

Sole sighting: Nick Gordon was only seen visiting Bobbi Houston's hospital once, on the day after she was found drowned. New claims say he staged the visit 'for the cameras' and did not actually go inside

Messy: It was also revealed that one of Nick and Bobbi’s neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found

Gordon has been in hiding since the photos were taken.

And on Friday, he released a statement requesting that the media 'cease speaking with unauthorized members of the family.' 

In addition, detectives have launched an investigation into how Bobbi Kristina was found with injuries on her chest, as well as additional bruises on her mouth and face.

Gordon has insisted it was wrong to blame him for the heiress's condition and that he desperately wanted to be allowed to see her.

He told a friend: 'I didn't do anything to my baby.'

'I just hope she wakes up and tells 'em what they all need to know.

'People are just jumping on my back cos she loves me. There's a load of nonsense being said about us. I love her, but I can't get anywhere near her.'

Gordon claims to have opened up discussions with Bobbi's family to try to persuade them to allow him to see his girlfriend, who has previously described him as her husband, although any marriage has been denied by her family.

There has only been one public visit to her bedside by Gordon, one the day after she was found drowned at the home they shared.

Since then he has not been seen at the hospital where she is being treated, although her father Bobby Brown, grandmother Cissy Houston and other relatives, such as her aunt and uncle Gary and Pat Houston, have been seen arriving or leaving the hospital virtually every day.  

The source said: 'He is frustrated, missing her and has had to sit back and feels helpless about everything. He just wants to be with her.'

Bobbi's cousin Jered Brown claimed Gordon was taking legal action to force the hands of her family to allow him to visit the young woman who has been in a medically induced coma since being found unresponsive at her Atlanta home.

But Gordon denied any legal moves last night and was said to be in 'constant prayer' for her recovery.

His attorneys Randy Kessler and Joe Habachy released a statement which said: 'In response to reports that Nick Gordon is taking legal action, he would like it to be clear, he is not.Disco

Treatment: Bobbi Kristina Brown, 21, has been in a coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta since January 31, when she was found face down in a bathtub

'Mr Gordon's only concern is the recovery of Bobbi Kristina

'He remains in constant prayer for his companion and he hopes to be reunited with her soon. Despite the incredible public interest, we ask and hope that this request can be resolved privately by Mr. Gordon and the family.'

Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives.

Last year, Bobbi Kristina's maternal aunt Marion Houston sought an order of protection against Gordon, accusing him of stalking her and sending her threatening messages, which reportedly included photos of guns. The restraining order expires in April.

Jered Brown said he had been helping Gordon, who was one of two people who found her in the bathtub, by acting as a liason between him and Bobbi's family.

'We sit down and talk about things he wants my family to know and what we would love for Krissy to know, and that is that he loves her and is just waiting for her to wake up,' he told the station 11Alive .

'To be honest with you, Nick is feeling very emotional right now behind all of this. He's pretty torn about about what's going on.'

He said Bobbi still needed ' a miracle' to survive and urged people to continue praying for her.

She had been troubled in the days before she was taken to hospital. Four days befoe she was driving and lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty, crashing into a gray Ford Taurus.

The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and transported to a hospital, according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia.

Police had also been called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there, but officers found no evidence of an altercation, said Roswell police spokeswoman Lisa Holland.

Whitney Houston was was found in a bathtub at a hotel near Los Angeles on February 11, 2012, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party.

The inquest ruled Houston's death was an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors.

Bobbi was her only child, although Gordon had been 'adopted' by the singer at the age of 12.

It is claimed Bobbi stands to inherit her mother's fortune of around $12 million when she reaches the age of 30.
