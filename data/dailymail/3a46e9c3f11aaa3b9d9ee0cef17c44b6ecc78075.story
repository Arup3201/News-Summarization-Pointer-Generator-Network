The man used a giant wave to take care of a serious eye condition known as pterygium, in which fibrous tissue grows over the outer layer of the eye. The ailment, popularly known as 'surfer's eye,' is is common in people who spend a lot of time outdoors in sunny climates.

Normally, pterygium requires surgery to treat. However, the 61-year-old surfer took a more radical route.

The surfer's eye three days after he stuck his head in the water to remove excess tissue from his eye though he did suffer mild inflammation as a result

He dipped his head in cascading water while riding a huge 30-foot wave in Waimea Bay, a popular surfing spot known for big waves off the coast of Oahu, according to research published recently in the journal BMJ Case Reports.

'He momentarily dipped his face into the water while travelling at top speed, but was able to recover his balance and continue surfing the wave,' Dr. Thomas Campbell, a medical officer at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Queensland, Australia wrote in the journal article late last month.

'This impressive maneuver resulted in the pterygium being ripped off his eye surface,' he added.

Although the surfer's eye was inflamed following his nontraditional medical treatment, his vision did return to normal..

The pterygium is not easy to remove, even with scalpels and scissors, Dr. Mark Fromer, an opthamologist at New York City's Lenox Hill hospital told LiveScience. Fromer said it's likely the force of the water from the wave ripped his conjunctiva, a membrane on the eye's surface, that would have provided a blood supply to the pterygium.

Although big wave surfers can reach speeds of 30 or 40 miles per hour, it's not easy for the blunt force of water to rip off a pterygium. This vascular tissue is even difficult to remove with scalpels and scissors,said Dr. Mark Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

'But it would take a heck of shot of water to do that,' he added. 'Pretty unlikely this is going to happen to anyone else.'
