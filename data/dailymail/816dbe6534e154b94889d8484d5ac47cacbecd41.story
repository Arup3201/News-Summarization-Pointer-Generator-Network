The parents of a 16-year-old girl carried out an elaborate Facebook sting to prove their daughter's new sex offender boyfriend was bad news - by ensnaring him with a fake account.

Jesper and Julie Myrfors pretended to be a 15-year-old girl and, within hours, 19-year-old Liam Elms was sending the fake account sexually explicit photos and messages, police said.

Horrified, they immediately showed their daughter the sickening messages and alerted police in their hometown of Sedro-Wooley, Washington.

Concern: Jesper and Julie Myrfors thought their daughter's sex offender boyfriend was bad news so created a fake Facebook account of a teenage girl to show his true colours

The parents had thought Elms charming when they met him, but on discovering he was a registered sex offender, they tried to dissuade their unidentified daughter from continuing the relationship.

When she refused, they set up a fake Facebook profile - without any involvement from police - and pretended to be a girl named 'Ashley', complete with photos and friends on the site.

'When we did this, we had rules,' Mr Myrfors told King5. 'We were not trying to entrap him. We were setting him up a situation where, if he was a bad guy, he could act on it.'

To start communication between Ashley and Elms, they made up a fight between their daughter and the fake girl and confided in Elms about the
situation, the Skagit Valley Herald reported.

Communication: The parents made up a fight between their daughter and the fake girl and pretended to confide in Elms, who began sending the account sexually-explicit photographs and messages

Bad news: He also encouraged the fake girl to sneak out of her house and leave on a camping trip with him

A day after accepted Elms' Facebook friend request, the conversation between he and Mrs Myrfors turned 'dirty, violent and nasty', police records show.

Elms then sent sexually explicit photos of himself to Ashley's email address from the mobile phone number that police have as his main contact, according to the police affidavit.

He allegedly tried to persuade the fake teen to leave her house to join him on a camping trip, and discussed his planned sexual activity. He added she should claim to be 16 if anyone asks.

'My daughter didn't know we had done this,' Mrs Myrfors said. 'I invited her on to begin watching live.  She started watching conversations. The hardest part as a parent was watching her heart break.'

Protective: The parents carried out the sting without any involvement from law enforcement officals

Scheme: They said they were not trying to catch Elms out, just find out his true character (file picture)

They alerted police and Elms was arrested on August 18 after being 
released from the Snohomish County Jail in Everett, where he was serving
time for a probation violation.

'When there's a question, follow it. Find the answer for your kids,' Julie Myrfors said.

The Skagit Valley Herald reported Elms is scheduled to be arraigned on Thursday morning in Skagit County Superior Court on two counts of immoral communication with a minor.

He is being held on $25,000 bail.

He remains under state supervision for his prior third-degree child molestation conviction and is a registered level 1 sex offender, which indicates low risk of a repeated offense.
