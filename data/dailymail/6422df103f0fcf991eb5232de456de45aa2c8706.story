Liverpool will look to sell Mario Balotelli but the chances of him leaving in January are small.

The Italy forward has failed to deliver on the pitch and Liverpool can ill afford any passengers at the moment having scored just seven league goals at Anfield this season.

However, the injury to Daniel Sturridge and the likelihood that Divock Origi will stay at Lille, at this stage, means Balotelli will likely see out the season.

Liverpool will look to sell Mario Balotelli but the chances of the misfit striker leaving in January are small

Liverpool do not wish to buy their way out of trouble but will continue to evaluate potential new strikers.

Porto's Jackson Martinez has been offered to them, while West Ham's prolific Diafra Sakho and West Bromwich Albion's Saido Berahino have been watched.

The goalkeeper situation is still pressing for manager Brendan Rodgers and they have watched Cologne's Timo Horn, a 21-year-old 6ft 4in Germany Under 21 keeper, a couple of times but ideally need an experienced man to replace current No 1 Simon Mignolet.

West Ham are monitoring Marseille defender Nicolas N'Koulou as they prepare to lose Winston Reid.

While Sam Allardyce was ensuring his team were riding high in third position in the Premier League on Sunday, clubs scouts were dispatched to watch versatile Cameroon man N'Koulou.

West Ham are bracing themselves for offers for Reid who has attracted interest from Arsenal and Everton. He is out of contract in the summer and the chances of him agreeing a new deal look slim.

The Hammers are reluctant to sell but will do should someone offer £6million or more in the January window.

The 24-year-old N'Koulou played in the middle of a three man defence as Marseille beat Metz 3-1 on Sunday.

A former target for Arsenal and Atletico Madrid, N'Koulou is well regarded around Europe. He is a product of the Kadji Sports Academy in Douala which also helped develop Samuel Eto'o and previously played for Monaco.

Napoli, Liverpool and Newcastle have also watched him in recent seasons.

Cardiff City are showing an interest in Celtic striker Anthony Stokes.

The 26-year-old Republic of Ireland forward has scored seven goals this season, including the winner against Motherwell on Saturday.

He has averaged just under a goal every two games during his time at Celtic and that has alerted English league clubs looking for strikers in January.

The Dubliner began his career with Shelbourne before moving to Arsenal. He had subsequent spells at Sunderland, Sheffield United and Crystal Palace but failed to make an impact. 

There is a sense he still wants to prove himself south of the border and Cardiff are willing to give him a chance. Celtic may listen to bids around £2m.

Everton are following Legia Warsaw midfielder Ondrej Duda.

The Slovakia star caught the eye of Toffees scouts when he starred for Legia in their Champions League demolition of Celtic early in the season. The Polish club were thrown out because they fielded an ineligible player but Duda has continued to impress.

Everton have been present at Legia's last four games and Roberto Martinez's trusted chief scout Kevin Reeves has also been along to watch the 20-year-old.

Duda, who has scored five goals this season, plays as an attacking midfielder and sometimes as a secondary striker but he can also play deeper and has an eye for a pass.

Legia only signed him last summer on a free after he allowed his contract to run down at previous club Kosice.

The Poles value Duda in the £7m bracket but Everton would be looking to pay around £3.5m if they press ahead.

Everton do not wish to sell their players but are wary of increased interest in James McCarthy - on whom Arsenal and Tottenham are keen - and Ross Barkley.

Crystal Palace want a centre forward in January and have evaluated the merits of Bafetimbi Gomis at Swansea, Connor Wickham of Sunderland and Watford's Troy Deeney.

Gomis has a £7m release clause but would prefer a move to a bigger club should he leave Swansea while Wickham is leaning towards signing a new deal at Sunderland.

Deeney is a player several Premier League sides are considering but he won't come cheap with Watford holding out for at least the same £11m fee Leeds gained from Fulham for Ross McCormack. That is likely to deter Palace.

Newcastle are continuing to watch Anderlecht's Aleksandar Mitrovic ahead of a proposed January bid. 

Club scouts watched the 20-year-old against Galatasaray in the Champions League. Although he failed to score in a 2-0 win, the Serbia striker still had a decent game.

Mitrovic is valued at £15m and scored the equaliser for Anderlecht in their 3-3 draw with Arsenal last month. He has nine goals this season.

Alan Pardew wants someone to share the burden with Papiss Cisse and 6ft 3in Mitrovic is seen as a player who can also develop with good sell-on value.

Sunderland and Swansea are among clubs chasing Palermo defender Ezequiel Munoz but there is a wrangle developing over who represents him. 

The 24-year-old Argentine is available for around £4m and has several European clubs on his trail with several agents also proposing a deal.

However, it is understood Italian agent Claudio Mossio is the man with the valid paperwork. Munoz, whose nickname is El Chiquito, was formerly with Boca Juniors has dual Spanish nationality and can play centre back and right back.
