The Republican race for a vacant Nevada Senate seat has turned into an all out war after a website appeared online portraying one candidate as a hard-drinking party girl.

The site shows pictures of Mari St. Martin drinking, dancing and playing beer pong and dismisses her as immature, inexperienced and unqualified.

Married mother of one Mrs St. Martin is furious, claiming the photos are five years old and have been taken out of context.

She told local news station Fox 5: 'I know that they were Photoshopped. I know that they were altered and I know that they were cropped.

'These days you can portray anyone they way you want them to look.'

Her rival for the June 12 primary, local businessman Brent Jones, is praised throughout the site.

A list of his attributes suggests he's a 'mature, responsible and successful business owner,' while Mrs St. Martin is attacked for having 'zero business experience' and accused of following the old politicians plot of "say anything to win".'

Addressing the photos of her partying and playing drinking games, it adds: 'Mari St. Martin claims to have experience for the job. The only experience she has demonstrated thus far is her propensity to "party hearty".'

The site also compares Mrs St. Martin to former Nevada senator Elizabeth Halseth, who resigned from the District 9 seat in February, after it emerged she had cheated on her husband.

Mrs Halseth, who held the seat for two years, was also criticised for posing in a bikini in Maxim magazine.

Featuring a censored version of Mrs Halseth's Maxim picture, the website adds: 'We all remember the shameful saga of Elizabeth Halseth... who abandoned us after just two years.

'Halseth simply lacked the maturity and experience.

'We now have another candidate in the Republican Primary who has demonstrated a lack of maturity and experience - meet Mari St. Martin.'

Mr Jones insists he has no link to 
the group behind the site, Republicans United, but he's backing the 
claims it makes about his rival.

He said: 'I think the pictures are pretty self-explanatory and someone can form 
the opinion if they think she's a partier, per se.'

'If anything on this website is improper, or illegal, or not true, if 
(St. Martin) lets us know, I will be the first one to defend Mari.'

There's a history of bad blood between the two republican - Mr Jones has filed a slander lawsuit against Mrs St. Martin after she claimed online that he convinced  a mentally disabled man to pay $30,000 for an ostrich egg business.
