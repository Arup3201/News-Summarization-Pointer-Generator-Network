Australian Marathon swimmer Chloe McCardel has successfully broken the world record for the longest ever unassisted open-water swim, despite suffering excruciating box jellyfish stings and hypothermia.

After 43 hours of swimming the treacherous Bamahian waters unassisted, it was incredibly emotional for Chloe McCardel, as she collapsed into her husband Paul McQueeny's arms on the shore.

Her husband was at her side as she swam, looking on from a boat as she battled through the water, but the rules stated no one could touch or physically assist the swimmer throughout the duration of her record attempt. 

The strong currents forced the 29-year-old to head to land early, shortening her swimming distance by two kilometres, but the well-deserved record was still hers.

The Melbourne swimmer could barely stand as she staggered out of the ocean and has been taken to hospital to treat her injuries. 

It's understood McCardel was stung by 10 to 12 box jellyfish just 13 hours into her swim, which caused painful welts on her arms, legs, shoulders and armpits.

The non-stop open-water swim, from the southern tip of the island of Eleuthera to Nassau, was expected to take up to 48 hours to complete.

The marathon swimmer swam ahead of her target and, despite her injuries, completed the record-breaking swim in just 43 hours.

The Melbournite's previous attempt for the record ended due to extensive jellyfish stings. 

McCardel was pulled from the water 11 hours into a swim from Cuba to the US after suffering venomous jellyfish stings to her throat and body.

'I felt like I was engulfed with flames but from the inside,' she recalled.

'It was so intense that I didn't care about the swim anymore.' 

Before beginning the swim, McCardel said she expected to be stung by less jellyfish in the Bahamas.

The 29-year-old, who has already swum across the English Channel seven times, admitted her planned record swim is a very tall order.

'It is insane,' McCardel told AAP before she departed.

'That's why no one's done it.'

McCardel has now surpassed a similar record set by Australian-British swimmer Penny Palfrey in 2011.

Palfrey swam 112km in the Cayman Islands whilst wearing a bodysuit while McCardel wore only bathers, goggles and a cap.

She travelled without a shark net but had spotters and shark repellent 'bombs' on hands, which release the odour of rotting shark into the water.

McCardel, who has previously set records for swimming 60 laps across Bondi Beach and completing two non-stop double crossings of the English Channel, says she feels a special connection during a long swim.

'There is so much time out there,' she said.

'It can be a bit spiritual.'

'You feel like you're a part of that environment, you're an extension of it.'

Her record-breaking swim took a year of research and planning

Chloe McCardel departs on Friday and her swim start date will depend on suitable weather conditions
