The acting head of the Metropolitan Police has clashed with the Prime Minister over a suggestion that the Army could be deployed to quell rioting in London.

Tim Godwin told David Cameron he would agree to troops on the streets of London only after ‘every one of my officers and borough commanders are standing on the police front line’.

The row happened last Tuesday morning in a meeting in Downing Street between the two men and Home Secretary Theresa May.

It took place shortly before a meeting of Cobra, the Government’s national security committee.

News of Mr Godwin’s intervention comes after a series of disagreements between the Government and the police over the handling of the riots.

Last week Mr Godwin implicitly attacked the Prime Minister when he criticised politicians ‘who weren’t there’ for making judgments about Scotland Yard’s response to the violence.

It is understood that Mr Cameron was keen to explore a number of options and contingency plans as the riots spread across the capital.

One of these was bringing in the Army. But later at the Cobra meeting, Mr Godwin repeated his objections to using soldiers.

Last week the Prime Minister told MPs
that ‘far too few’ officers had been deployed when the trouble started 
and that the police had initially treated the violence ‘too much as a 
public order issue’ rather than as one of criminality.

His
comments have antagonised senior police officers. Sir Hugh Orde, the 
president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, dismissed 
politicians’ claims that Ministers had ordered the tougher approach that
ended the violence.

Hitting back: The acting Metropolitan Police Commissioner has repeated his objections to using soldiers

Last week the Prime Minister said that 'far too few' officers had been deployed when the trouble started and that the police had initially treated the violence 'too much as a public order issue' rather than as one of criminality

He said that the police had deployed reinforcements to trouble-hit districts, adding that the return of politicians to Westminster was ‘an irrelevance’.

He later expressed his concerns with the appointment of Bill Bratton, the Independent on Sunday reported: 'I am not sure I want to learn about gangs from an area of America that has 400 of them. It seems to me, if you've got 400 gangs, then you're not being very effective. If you look at the style of policing in the States, and their levels of violence, they are fundamentally different from here.

'What i suggested to the Home Secretary is a more sensible approach, maybe to look across far wider styles of policing; and, more usefully, at European styles - they, like us, are bound by the European Convention. My sense is, when we've done that, we will find the British model is probably the top.'

By Friday, the Prime Minister was trying to mend relations with the police and said that police commanders, not politicians, were in charge of the response to the riots.

‘Clearly there was a need for more [police] on the streets,’ said Mr Cameron.

‘There was a need to change tactics and I think it is right that police took those decisions.’

Downing Street said last night that it would not comment on a private meeting between the Prime Minister and the head of the Metropolitan Police.
