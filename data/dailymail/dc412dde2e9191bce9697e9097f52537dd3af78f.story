Thierry Henry believes Chelsea will win the Barclays Premier League because Jose Mourinho knows how to avoid losing when his team aren't playing at their best.

The Arsenal legend was acting as a Sky Sports pundit for Chelsea's showdown with champions Manchester City at Stamford Bridge, though Mourinho may count himself lucky to escape with a point.

Chelsea took the lead through Loic Remy but were under pressure after David Silva's equaliser, and Henry feels the London club showed signs of true Premier League champions.

'Let’s give them (Manchester City) credit. Who took a point at the Bridge this year? No-one,' Henry told Sky Sports after the match. 

'They came back into the game. They had possession, more opportunities. They didn’t win. But you’re still playing against Chelsea. 

'They took a point. Could they have done a bit more? Maybe. 

'That’s what Chelsea does. They might not play well sometimes, but they win 1-0. They suffered today, they didn’t lose. That’s why they are the team that I think will end up champions.

'I do believe that. For me they are very strong. They can win when they’re not playing well. That’s the sign usually of champions.'
