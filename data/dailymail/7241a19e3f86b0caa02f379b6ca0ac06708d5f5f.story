Glennis Brierley, 64, was found stabbed to death at her home in Littleborough, near Rochdale

Detectives investigating the killing of a respected marriage guidance counsellor were quizzing her son on suspicion of murder today.

Psychotherapist Glennis Brierley, 64, was found with stab wounds inside her terraced cottage after police received a call from a phone box saying she had been killed.

Officers later arrested her 45-year-old son over the death and he is being questioned on suspicion of murder.

A police spokesman said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with Mrs Brierley's death.

Mrs Brierley, who is said to have lived alone in Littleborough, near Rochdale, was a qualified and experienced psychotherapist with a masters degree in Gestalt psychotherapy, a branch of therapy which focuses on personal responsibility.

She was also an artist specialising in watercolours and sketches of plants and flowers.

Mrs Brierley's body was discovered at midnight on December 13, after police received a 999 call saying that a woman had been killed. Her unnamed son was arrested eight hours later.

Greater
Manchester Police said a post mortem was being carried out to establish
the cause of death but said she was discovered with visible stab 
injuries.

Superintendent Chris Hankinson said: 
'This woman has been murdered in her own home and our focus is on 
ensuring justice is done and the perpetrator is brought to justice.'

He added: 'I also want to reassure them and the wider public of Greater Manchester that we are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with this woman’s murder.'

Regulars at the King William IV pub near Mrs Brierley's home said she was often there for the Tuesday night quiz.

One local said: 'She was a lovely, lovely woman and she will be deeply missed. Although she had a job which meant her engaging with many members of the public and exploring their private lives, she kept her own private life very much to herself.

'It's such a shock - this is a really tight-knit community.'

From her consulting room on the top 
floor of her home Mrs Brierley charged couples £50 an hour to advise 
them on difficulties in their relationship and issues such as anxiety, 
depression, loss, guilt and shame.

On
her website she wrote: 'I provide a safe non judgemental space in which
to explore your concerns. As well as being non judgemental and 
supportive, sometimes you might need me to be more challenging. I can do
this too - we can talk about all of this.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
