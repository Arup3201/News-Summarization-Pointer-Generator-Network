Thousands of children are starting secondary school unable to run, jump, throw a ball or catch, the head of UK Sport has said.

Susan Campbell has claimed 'physically illiterate' children 'hardly move' by the time they are ready to make the transition from primary school.

And she said the legacy of the Olympics in the summer could be lost if teachers in primary schools did not receive specialist PE training.

She warned some 11-year-olds aren't able to take part in the most basic of sports by the time they go to secondary school.

Baroness Campbell, chairwoman of UK Sport and the Youth Sport Trust, said sport should be taken as seriously as literacy and numeracy in primary schools.

And she has called for primary school teachers to receive extra training in PE.

She told the London Evening Standard while there was enthusiasm among youngsters to get involved in sport after the Olympics, they may miss out because of a lack of training among primary school teachers.

Baroness Campbell said about 20 per cent of pupils aged five are overweight when they start school, and the statistics only get worse as they make their way through school.

She said: 'Some secondary school teachers have 11-year-old pupils who hardly move, let alone catch or run.

'If a teacher has ten children out of 30 like that in the class, it is a job to give them the focus they need.

'They can’t catch, throw, jump or run — the fundamental basic movements of every sport.'

Speaking before the North of England Education Conference, in Sheffield, Baroness Campbell said primary school teachers receive minimal training in PE, with most saying they do not feel confident in giving lessons in the subject.

The Department for Education has said competitive sport is being placed at the centre of its reforms of schools, according to The Telegraph.

It said it was looking to raise the status of sport in primary schools and was staging an Olympic-style school games.
