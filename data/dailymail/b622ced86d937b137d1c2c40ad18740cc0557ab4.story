It might sound like it has come straight out of a Star Wars film, but the International Space Station (ISS) is set to get a huge ‘laser cannon’ by the end of this year.

This laser, however, may leave Darth Vader a little underwhelmed, as instead of destroying the planet it will be used to study it in more detail.

Named the Cloud Aerosol Transport System, dubbed Cats, it will look at the distribution of aerosols in space to map pollution and changes in the climate.

The size of a refrigerator, Cats will provide detailed information about the particles in Earth's atmosphere

Aerosols are the tiny particles that make up haze, dust, air pollutants, and smoke and could have far-reaching on the planet’s environment,

When Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted nearly four years ago, for instance, officials grounded flights in Europe.

They believed particles contained within its massive plume could damage aircraft engines, resulting in potentially deadly consequences for passengers.

Nasa couldn’t dispatch aircraft-borne instruments for the very same reasons European officials had grounded commercial aircraft.

The laser is scheduled to launch to the space station later this year as a demonstration project and will fire around 5,000 laser pulses per second

The Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (Cats) will provide measurements of the particulate contents within the atmosphere including clouds and aerosols.

A powerful laser will provide data on the location, composition and distribution of atmospheric elements which impact the climate on a global scale.

This refrigerator-sized sensor laser is 
scheduled to launch to the space station in late this year as a demonstration
 project and will fire around 5,000 laser pulses per second.

Long-term data from the laser may reveal  shifts in global climate over time and location.

But using Cats, when the next volcano erupts, Nasa will be able to monitor the spread of particles in Earth’s atmosphere from its space-based perch.

This refrigerator-sized sensor laser is scheduled to launch to the space station in late 2014 as a demonstration project and will fire around 5,000 laser pulses per second.

Its sensors will help researchers determine for the first time exactly what laser technology can do from space to measure tiny airborne particles - also known as aerosols - in Earth’s atmosphere.

Developed by scientist Matt McGill, and his team, Cats will be able to see the character as well as vertical and horizontal distribution of aerosols in a whole new light.

The laser may leave Darth Vader a little underwhelmed, as instead of destroying the planet, like the Death Star (pictured), it will be used to study the Earth in more detail

This will deliver more detailed information and could help scientists differentiate between the types of particles in the atmosphere.

‘You get better data quality because you make fewer assumptions, and you get, presumably, a more accurate determination of what kind of particles you’re seeing in the atmosphere,’ said Dr McGill.

Knowing where aerosols are located in the atmosphere - such as smoke from forest fires, dust blowing off vast deserts, and plumes from erupting volcanoes - is often critically important.

The station travels in a precessing orbit, which means that instead of passing over the same spot at the same time, its orbit moves.

By reflecting sunlight into space, clouds help regulate the Earth's climate. This image was taken from aboard the International Space Station, which is where Cats will measure cloud aerosols

The station’s ground track moves westward along each of 16 daily tracks as it travels, with ground track repeats every three days. As a result, CATS will provide good coverage of what’s happening over primary population centres.

In addition, the station passes over and along many of the primary aerosol-transport paths within Earth’s atmosphere.

One of Earth’s primary transport routes for airborne pollutants is from Asia. Particles are transported by circulation cells in Earth’s atmosphere over Japan, northward up just under Alaska, and then down towards the West Coast of the United States, making a big, inverted ‘U’ shape.

Long-term data from the laser may also reveal the shifts in global climate over time and location.

In 2010, Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted, creating an expansive ash cloud that disrupted air traffic throughout Europe and across the Atlantic. The Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (Cats) could improve the ability to measure volcanic particles and other aerosols from space

It will study distribution of aerosols that make up haze, dust and pollutants

For instance, it could look at plumes of ash clouds, which are currently difficult to model from space and can ground aircraft
