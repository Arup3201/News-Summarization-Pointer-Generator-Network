The vigilante dressed as Batman who frogmarched a wanted man into a police station was today unmasked as a Chinese takeaway delivery driver.

Stan Worby, 39, claims he was the caped crusader who stunned officers and passers-by when he swept into the station in a costume from the 1960s TV series before vanishing into the night.

CCTV footage shows the slightly 
overweight superhero taking the fraud suspect to the front desk, where he calmly 
waited for the duty officer and then told him: ‘Here you 
are, it’s over to you now.’

The footage had earlier caused a frenzy
 on the internet as viewers speculated who the superhero might be. Last night, Mr Worby claimed it was him.

The man Mr Worby delivered to the station was actually his friend, Daniel Frayne, who explained who he was to the officer.

After being escorted into Trafalgar 
House police station at 1.35am last Monday, Frayne was arrested on 
suspicion of burglary, fraud and breach of a court order.

He was later 
charged with handling stolen goods and fraud-related offences and is due
 to appear before the city’s magistrates on Friday.

Telling all: Mr Worby, 39, said the incident was a practical joke and was keen to emphasise that he isn't carrying as much weight as people have assumed as he was wearing a tracksuit underneath the outfit

A police spokesman said: ‘The person 
who brought the wanted man into the station was dressed in a full Batman
 outfit.

His identity, however, remains unknown. The Batman outfit was a
 normal fancy dress costume and whoever had decided to put it on knew 
the suspect was wanted by police.’

Residents on the street where Frayne 
lives with his girlfriend said police had been looking for him for 
several weeks.

‘They drove up and down here every day to check on the 
house and we’ve not seen him around here for quite a while,’ said 
neighbour Kaley Wilkinson, 27.

‘He’s a very serious-looking  guy and not the sort of person  you would think would be involved in a prank.’

Wherever the superhero came from, he 
certainly caused a stir. Bishop of Bradford, the Rt Rev Nick Baines, 
said: ‘I think it’s dead funny.

'The only thing that concerns me – 
judging from the waistline and tights – is that he doesn’t look that 
fit.’

City council leader David Green added: ‘Clearly, whoever this 
individual is has a good sense of humour and a sense of the surreal.’

A police source said: ‘We think it’s a friend who obviously thought this would be a funny thing to do.’
