International plot: Al-Saadi Gaddafi and his family were going to be smuggled into Mexico, it is claimed

An international plot to smuggle one of Colonel Gaddafi’s sons into Mexico for a life of luxury with his family has been foiled, officials said yesterday.

The plan, which involved Mexican and Danish conspirators and was led by a Canadian woman, was to spirit Saadi Gaddafi into the country after he fled Libya in September.

The plotters flew to Mexico, opened bank accounts with forged ID papers, and bought safe houses around the country.

The main home was a villa in an exclusive area of the Pacific resort of Puerto Vallarta, which is popular with both British and U.S. tourists. His neighbours would have included the likes of Lady Gaga and Charlie Sheen.

Gary Peters, boss of a Canadian private security company, said he was involved in the operation and visited the villa twice.

Playboy businessman Saadi, his wife 
and children would have been flown over on private planes and protected 
by security men hired by Mr Peters for £650 a day.

The plot was foiled when ringleader, 
Canadian Cynthia Vanier,  and other conspirators were arrested. Vanier 
was said to be ‘the direct contact with the Gaddafi family’.

Saadi, 38, Gaddafi’s third son, is 
living in the West African nation of Niger. The UN has frozen his assets
and banned him from crossing international borders. Interpol is seeking
his extradition while Libya’s new leaders accuse him of theft and 
‘armed intimidation’ while running the Libyan football federation.

Niger has said he would remain in the West African nation until a United Nations travel ban is lifted.

The plotters themselves used a 
network of flights between Mexico, the United States, Canada, Kosovo and
the Middle East to plan the route and organize the logistics for Saadi 
Gaddafi's arrival, Mr Poire said.

'The
large economic resources which this criminal organization has, or had, 
allowed them to contract private flights,' Poire told a news conference.

But the suspects were arrested after a tip-off.

'The (authorities) succeeded in avoiding this risk, they dismantled the international criminal network which was attempting this and they arrested those presumed responsible,' Poire said.

Mr Poire said Ms Vanier ‘was the direct contact with the Gaddafi family and
the leader of the group, and presumably was the person in charge of the
finances of the operation.’

An employee of Canada's foreign ministry said the office would look into the report of the arrest but had no immediate comment.

The plot also allegedly involved a Mexican woman, Gabriela Davila Huerta, also known as de Cueto.

She lived in the United States and served as the liaison to obtain the falsified Mexican identity documents.

She was arrested alongside fellow Mexican Jose Luis Kennedy Prieto.

Pierre Christian Flensborg, from Denmark, was ‘the logistic liaison’ for the plan.

Mr Poire said: ‘The activities of the
criminal organisation in our country included the falsification of 
official documents, the opening of bank accounts with false documents, 
the purchase of real estate that were intended, among other things, to 
serve as a residence for the Gaddafi family.’

Saadi Gaddafi's lawyer Nick Kaufman said his client was still in Niger, where he fled as his father's 42-year rule crumbled in August.

‘He is fully respecting the restraints placed on him presently by the international community,’ Kaufman told Reuters.

Like many senior members of the Gaddafi regime, Saadi, a businessman and former professional soccer player, was banned from traveling and had his assets frozen by a U.N. Security Council resolution when violence erupted earlier this year.

Interpol has issued a ‘red notice’ requesting member states to arrest Saadi with a view to extradition if they find him in their territory.
