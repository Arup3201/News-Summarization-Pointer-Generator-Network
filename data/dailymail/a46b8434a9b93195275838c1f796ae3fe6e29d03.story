A woman who has shed 14 stone said her incentive was to be an 'active aunty' and set a good example on healthy living to her niece and nephew.

And Abi Wright from Rugby has certainly achieved that. Not only is she now able to run around after Freya, 6, Finn, 4, and Faron, 1, she's also planning to take part in her first half marathon.

The territorial manager for a medical company, who is in her thirties, used to weight 25-and-a-half-stone and was a dress size 32-34.

Abi Wright lost 14 stone after becoming a aunty

She told the MailOnline she had always struggled with her weight and overindulged daily on crisps, chocolate and takeaways.

She explains: 'I kept gaining weight because I couldn't take control of what I was eating. Some people may have a pair of jeans and they know they've put on a few pounds if they become too tight so they cut back on junk foods. But I would just get the next size up in jeans.

'I tried diets but I couldn't get to grips with them, I didn't have the will power.'

Abi said it was becoming an aunty that gave her the incentive she needed to lose weight.

She said: 'I could barely walk and I couldn't take them swimming or run after them at the playground because of my size. I wanted to be an active aunty so I knew I had to do something to get my life back.'

After taking up running and ditching the junk food Abi now weighs 11 and a half stone and is preparing to run in the Royal Parks Half Marathon this Sunday

She swapped her unhealthy diet for one rich in fruit and vegetables and cut back on carbs. Multiple slices of toast at breakfast were swapped for muesli and she replaced the fizzy drinks she used to have regularly with water.

She also plucked up the courage to try running.

She said: 'Running was such a big challenge for me. I was too embarrassed to be seen running on public roads so I went to a local reservoir and ran there instead. Just taking those first running steps was an accomplishment, it was such an unknown feeling, like someone trying skiing for the first time.

'At first I struggled to run a mile but I kept pushing myself.'

Dinner: Takeway

Abi's efforts paid off, she became fitter and the weight started to come off. Two and half years later, she's now 11-and-a-half-stone and a dress size 12-14.

Abi said she has never felt more 
confident and now loves being active by exercising six days a week. She tries to support and inspire other people to follow in her weightloss footsteps via her Twitter handle @abiwrightonit. 

As well as now being able to run long distances, she said her new body shape has made a difference to the simple things 
in life.

'Now I can put my socks on more easily and tie my shoes laces and I can find clothes that fit,' she said.

She's now the fittest she has ever been and has progressed from completing a 5k race to a 5 miler to a 10k. Now she's planning to take part in the Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon in London on Sunday to raise money for the charity Scope.

She said: 'If someone had told me three years ago that I would be running a half marathon, I wouldn't have believed them. I'm not proud of how big I was but I am proud of what I have achieved now. 

'My parents, my sister, my brother and my amazing friends have given me the most incredible support.

'I hope I can inspire other people by showing that with will power and a positive attitude, you can achieve things you never felt possible.
