Kingpin: Juan David Ochoa ran the most powerful cocaine cartel in Columbia during the 1970s and 1980s, earning more than $60m a day

The eldest of the three Ochoa brothers who founded one of Colombia's most notorious cocaine cartels has died of a heart attack at age 65.

Juan David Ochoa died on Thursday at a private clinic in Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, Hospital officials and a cousin said.

Ochoa and brothers Jorge Luis and Fabio founded the infamous cartel with feared Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. But they all surrendered when the manhunt  for Escobar intensified.

Ochoa turned himself in 10 months 
before Escobar was killed and served five years and five months. 
Then-Justice Minister Carlos Medellin called his 1996 release 'a 
national disgrace'.

He returned to the family business of raising gait horses.

While Juan David avoided extradition 
to the United States, his youngest brother Fabio would not. Arrested in 
1999, Fabio was later sentenced to 30 years for drug trafficking.

At the height of their success in the
1970s and 1980s, The Medellin cartel smuggled cocaine throughout 
Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Honduras, the US, Canada and even Europe.

During that time, the cartel brought in more than $60 million per day

But the gang's downfall finally came 
when the Colombian government, aided by the Cali cartel, right-wing 
paramilitary groups and the US government, launched a massive crackdown.
If they couldn't capture and imprison its members, it sent hitmen out 
to assassinate them.

Escobar, who rose to head of the infamous Medellin Cartel, was shot dead in December 1993 as he tried to escape police.

At the height of his power in 1989, he was ranked the seventh richest man in the world by Forbes magazine with an estimated £18billion fortune.

The group's leaders became so rich that Escobar is reputed to have once burnt more than £1million to keep his 
daughter warm during a single night on the run.

While an enemy of the U.S. and Colombian governments, he was a hero to many in Medellin where he distributed money to the poor.

Some claim U.S. military snipers took part in the final hunt for Escobar, mounted after he escaped in 1992 from a private prison in Colombia.

He had the prison built under an agreement he would remain there for five years and avoid extradition to the States.
