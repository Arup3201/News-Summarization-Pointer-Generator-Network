Rampage: Geddy Kramer, pictured in his yearbook photo, has been identified as the shooter

The teenage worker who wounded at least six people at a FedEx package-sorting center outside Atlanta on Tuesday morning before killing himself has been identified as 19-year-old Geddy Kramer of Acworth, Georgia.

Armed with an assault rifle, knife and bullets strapped across his chest 'like Rambo', Kramer drove up to a guard shack and shot the security guard inside, then went in and shot five more people. Police arrived to find Kramer dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Three of the victims were critically 
wounded, though only one remained in critical condition by Tuesday 
afternoon. Police say three were in stable condition, and two others 
were treated and released.

Dr. Michael Nitzken told reporters at a
 news conference the victims suffered multiple gunshot wounds that were 
consistent with shotgun blasts.

Police
 said the 19-year-old gunman, described as 'looking like he was heading 
to war' was also armed with Molotov cocktails and worked for FedEx as a 
package handler.

Kramer was a FedEx employee who worked as a 
package handler at the facility, Pierce said. 'As far as I know, he worked at this 
location,' the officer said. 

FedEx clerk Liza Aiken said she was working inside when she heard something drop, looked to her left and saw the gunman.

'I looked to my left. I saw him 
standing there and the knife was on the ground. He dropped his knife. He
 had an assault rifle. He had bullets strapped to his chest like Rambo. I
 mean he looked like he was heading into war.

'As soon as I saw him, I ran the other way. I ran and made sure that people upstairs were gone. He was in all black.

'I think he had a camo vest. He had an
 assault rifle and bullets strapped to his chest.' Aiken said in a 
parking lot where employees were 
gathering near the station.

Before she could continue, a woman wearing a
 FedEx jacket told Aiken to stop talking and led her away.

Law enforcement officers works the scene after an early morning shooting at the Airport Road FedEx facility Tuesday on April 29, 2014, in Kennesaw, Georgia

'It was chaos,' Titus said. 'Everyone was running, ducking and hiding, trying to get out of there.'

A bomb team from the FBI was on the scene assisting in the investigation.

During
 a search near the FedEx facility after the shooting, police found and 
disabled 'incendiary devices,' a Cobb County police spokesman told The 
LA Times.

Six people
 wounded at the FedEx station were taken to nearby Wellstar Kennestone 
hospital. While three were considered critical, others had less serious 
injuries.

Two
 of the injured, a 28-year-old man and a 52-year-old woman had surgery 
and their injuries were called life threatening, by a hospital 
spokesman. The man was on a ventilator, the hospital said.

A third person, a 22-year-old man, was also listed as critical condition.

The
 other victims included a man, 38, who was in stable condition, a woman,
 42, who was treated and released, and a man, 19, who about to be 
released.

Two
 of the patients - the 28-year-old man and the 52-year-old woman - 
suffered life-threatening injuries and the man was placed on mechanical 
ventilation.

A doctor from the facility said the wounds 'appear to be (the result of) shotgun blast projectiles.'

'A lot of them were able to walk off the ambulance,' said hospital spokesman Tyler Pearson.

FedEx said
 the facility about 25 miles north of Atlanta is a hub where packages 
are sorted and loaded onto vehicles for delivery. It's located next to 
the general aviation airport for suburban Cobb County.

 Hogland, a ground driver at the FedEx facility at McCollum Field, told 
the Atlanta Journal Constitution, 'My boss called me about 6 o’clock
