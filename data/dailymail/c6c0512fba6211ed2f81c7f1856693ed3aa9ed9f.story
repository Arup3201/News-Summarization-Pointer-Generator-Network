Alleged fraudster: Mark Malik, 33, managed to steal nearly $1 million from investors claims the SEC

A former traffic cop is accused of impersonating a hedge fund tycoon worth $100m and tricking Wall Street financiers into giving him $850,000. 

Mark Malik, 33, has been charged with fraud after he was allegedly caught out when investors started asking for their money back, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

He is also accused of spending the money on trips to the Statue of Liberty, online dating and sending investors threatening emails in which he pretended to be a werewolf after his scam was discovered. 

Malik stole $850,000 from 16 foreign and domestic investors starting in 2011, says a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint released on Friday and is being held on $1m bail.

He has pleaded not guilty to securities fraud. He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

When investors reported Malik to the SEC for fraud he reportedly wrote an email from a non-existent employee saying that he died of a heart attack.

‘Mr. Malik has been (sic) passed away with the heart attack after accident. We will dissolve the fund shortly,’ the e-mail said.

When faking his death didn't work, Malik allegedly sent a clip from a werewolf movie to the investor who he thought had reported him along with the words, 'that's what I think I am.'

Malik allegedly told investors that he ran his own hedge fund that boasted assets of $100million, yet by the time he was caught the account for his Seven Sages fund was overdrawn by $310.

This December, an industry publication reported on his successful launch of a second $100 million fund, called Wolf Hedge Global Strategy.

He claimed that there was a $1billion deal to set his company public and that he was opening offices across the globe.

However, the SEC says that Malik, whose full name is Moazzam Ifzal Malik, was once employed as a waiter, a traffic cop, and a security guard and doesn't have a college degree.

When investors asked for their money back, Malik allegedly wrote them bizarre emails in reply.

'I AM CRYING, I AM A HUMAN BEING…NOT A MONEY MAKING MACHINE, I HAVE FEELINGS AND DREAMS,' he emailed one investor in February of last year.

'YEAH PUT ME IN JAIL GOOD JOB!' the email continued.

He sometimes responded more affectionately with emails saying, 'you know that I love you.'

'I am going deer hunting,' was another bizarre response to an investor’s request from their money back.

Other emails were defensive and angry and supposedly said things like, 'Go f**ck yourself,’ and ‘stop your nonsense.’

It may seem hard to believe, but companies like Bloomberg believed Malik was telling the truth and even reported his supposed earnings and gave him recognition.

In March 2011 a Bloomberg report identified Malik as a rising fund manager, based on data provided by Malik, the SEC said.

Bloomberg reported that Malik's Seven Sages fund had a 92.73% return on investment for 2012, the SEC said.

A Company called Barclay Hedge awarded Malik a 'gold star,' for his fund that reported high earnings.

USA Today reports that instead of investing his money he spent it on travel, jewelry, a Muslim dating site, and tuition for classes at Harvard's extension program.

Malik spent $30,116 on vacation travel, $36,124, for drinking and dining out, $25.53 at the Statue of Liberty Gift Shop, and a $49.99 subscription to a Muslim dating site.

Malik's Wolf Hedge bank account had a balance of negative $310 as of November of last year 2014, the SEC said.

According to Malik's Linked In profile he was employed at companies such as JPMorgan Chase  and Merrill Lynch.

Love's people: Not only does Mark Malik claim to love people, he supposedly told investors whose money he stole that he 'loved them' in emails 

The Wall Street Journal reports that his only experience was a two-year job in Jersey City as a trainee at a brokerage firm called E1 Asset Management Inc., which fired him in 2009.

Six months after being fired, Malik started his own fund Wall Street Creative Partners LP which had the same address as his home in Queens at the time.

It took Malik a year to attract his first investor and he eventually changed his firm's name to Seven Sages Capital LP.

As the years went on, the SEC says Malik kept building on his lies.

Back in October Malik took to his Twitter to announce that he was writing three books. He said one would be on start-ups, one would be on hedging strategies, and the third would be on human nature.

If he's convicted he'll have up to 20 years of free time to work on his opus.
