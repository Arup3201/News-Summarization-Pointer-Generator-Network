Faced with the explosive talent of Nick Kyrgios and his wall of Australian support, Andy Murray was so calm and clinical.

Whatever was thrown at him he soaked it up, like a seasoned football team executing its plan away from home and carving out the result, in this case a 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 quarter-final win over the local hero.

Having slain the Australian teenager to make his fifth semi-final at Melbourne Park, Murray was gracious in his on-court interview, impressing the crowd with warm words about Kyrgios’s future.

It was only later, when facing questions about his next opponent Tomas Berdych and his new coach Dani Vallverdu — Murray’s long-time friend and former chief lieutenant — that he became slightly prickly.

Vallverdu’s presence on the Czech’s team, just two months after he finished five years with the 27-year-old Scot’s team, provides a fascinating subtext to Thursday’s match. Privileged inside information will be traded.

But Murray is trying not to see it that way and disingenuously claimed that in other sports people do not talk about opposition coaches and managers.

‘My goal isn’t to beat Dani, my goal is to beat Berdych, so I don’t think about that,’ he said. ‘We’ll see how the match plays out and what the tactics are. But I also know what Dani thinks of Berdych’s game because he’s told me, so it works both ways. I’m happy to talk about Berdych and what his strengths and weaknesses are, but I don’t want to discuss what Dani does well and doesn’t do well, because I’m not playing him.’

Thereafter he reeled off the world No 7’s attributes, such as his height, strength and flat ballstriking ability, and how he must be playing well. That is true, for the newly-engaged Berdych has made it through without dropping a set and dismissed Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-0, 7-6, although the Spaniard — short of matches and possibly injured — was woefully out of touch in the first two sets.

Murray showed admirable fortitude against the youthful zest of Kyrgios but, whatever the circumstances, will feel more vulnerable against Berdych. The 29-year-old holds a 4-2 career record against him, and there have been matches in which he has found his easy power difficult to handle.

Now there is the emotional dimension of having his one-time ally plotting against him, the Venezuelan boy who befriended him as an adolescent at their tennis academy in Barcelona and who knows him, warts and all.

In his exclusive interview with Sportsmail last week, Vallverdu went out of his way to stay classy, declaring that he would ‘always be in Andy’s corner, except if I am coaching against him’.

He also endorsed the hiring of Amelie Mauresmo as head coach last summer, even though he was hurt at not being kept informed about the hiring. The one thing he has taken exception to is Murray’s suggestion that not everyone in the team was pulling in the same direction towards the end of last year.

What you know is that the gloves will be off as he sits at opposite ends of the stadium to his former colleagues on Thursday (at about 8.30am in the UK), and Murray will need to show the same resolve as he did against Kyrgios. 

It could be argued that, for all its breathtaking skill and athleticism, the rivalries in the men’s game can be a little too cordial at times. The untamed demeanour of the 19-year-old Australian has been a welcome blast of refreshment here.

He had no option but to come out blasting against Murray and try to feed off the crowd, though they are fundamentally well-disposed towards Murray here. Instead he found his game brilliantly neutered by the master tactician on an evening when at least the chill temperatures will have made the Scot feel at home.

Murray slowed down his opponent’s quick tempo between points, and prevented him from teeing off with a subtle mix of pace, angles and slices, including some feathered drop-shots.

Not only that but the Scot’s serve was outstanding, and his 13 aces outscored by four the man who came into the match having hit the most in the tournament.

To add to his deflation, at 2-5 Kyrgios was given an audible obscenity violation, having cursed his way through his previous match without punishment. There was inconsistency in that, and the way he escaped censure when smashing his racket in the tiebreak.

Memorably, Murray had played an exquisite running lob to stop his momentum in that, and then he performed another on set point to clinch it 7-5. It was a glorious example of touch and technique, and clarity of thought, under enormous pressure. 

Kyrgios, whose brief charge in the third set was undone by some extraordinary flicks from Murray off the baseline, will come again. Asked where he would like to be when he returns here next year he responded drily: ‘Melbourne.’

Nadal, who denied he was injured, needs more matches, and he will get them next month when he heads to clay-court events in South America. But his defeat will still have served as a boost to the sometimes brittle Berdych, who had lost to him 17 consecutive times.

For all sorts of reasons Murray will have masses of motivation when they meet, and so will he.
