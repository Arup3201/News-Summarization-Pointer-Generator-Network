Working class Britons are twice as likely to resort to diet pills as those in richer areas.

The Sheffield University research showed that while the middle-classes sign up for Weight Watchers, Slimming World and other slimming clubs, those in more deprived areas put their faith in pills and potions.

These include prescription drugs, herbal remedies and meal replacement drinks.

The class divide surprised the researchers who speculated that those who are less well off may be more tempted by the promise of a quick fix.

Popping a pill may also work out cheaper than paying for week after week of classes.

Researcher Dr Clare Relton said: ‘I think one obvious possible reason is that it is sometimes cheaper and quicker to take a pill, or supplement, to help in weight management.

‘Slimming clubs could be more expensive and people would have to follow weight management strategy over a period of time, rather than just say taking a pill.

‘You have to get to a slimming class, spend some time there, pay your £4 or £5, go back home and try to adjust every meal you eat.

‘Whereas, buying something over the counter is something you do perhaps once a month and is quicker in the long-term.

‘Also, we are a very much a pill taking society. It is staggering the amount of pills we take, with the average person taking two a day, for some reason or another.’

More than half of the 26,000 people from South Yorkshire surveyed by Dr Relton were overweight and almost one in five was obese.

Rates of obesity were highest in deprived areas and among the elderly.

The most common techniques used to lose weight were eating healthily, cutting back on portions and exercising more.

Those living least well off areas shunned these methods were particularly likely to take weight loss pills, supplements and shakes.

Some four per cent used these ‘quick fixes’, compared to just two per cent of the more affluent slimmers.

The study also showed that men were more likely to be overweight – 44 per cent compared with just 31 per cent of the women questioned.

Despite this, the men were less worried about their weight.

Dr Relton added that our loved of pre-prepared, plastic-wrapped snacks has led to us losing our natural connection with food and eating without thinking.

'Obesity is very much a problem within society in the UK. We have a cultural difference in our country, where one set of people has a lot of money to spend, and other people don’t have very much at all, and this changes the way people approach dieting, or weight management.

‘So it is very much a societal problem. A lot of people are now referred to the NHS for weight related problems.

'But the NHS is supposed to be there to treat illness and sickness, so people have been asking is it really the NHS’s problem?

‘I don’t think obesity is a sickness or a disease, say like diabetes, but it is a different kind, it is a societal sickness.’
