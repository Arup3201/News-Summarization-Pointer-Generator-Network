Liverpool were the beneficiaries of a decision that Gary Lineker described as the 'worst penalty decision ever' in their clash at home against Leicester City.

The hosts took the lead through a Steven Gerrard penalty in the 17th minute but their visitors were left furious after referee Mike Jones deemed that Wes Morgan handled the ball in the penalty area when it seemed to hit him in the face.

An excellent sliding pass from Liverpool forward Coutinho released Raheem Sterling in the 16th minute and as the frontman checked back, Leicester defender Morgan slid in and was adjudged to have handled.

Replays, however, indicate that the ball struck Morgan's head and Jones, the referee, appears to have made a very poor decision.

That was certainly the view of Leicester legend  Lineker on New Year's Day.

The Match of the Day presenter tweeted: 'Worst penalty decision ever as Mike Jones gives handball against Leicester's Morgan at Anfield when it him in the face.'

After the official awarded Liverpool another penalty, which Gerrard scored to make it 2-0, Lineker added: 'Mike Jones strikes again! Two ludicrous penalty decisions! Wait until you see some of the refereeing decisions on MOTD.

'I reckon some of them may have been celebrating too hard last night.' 

Leicester players surround the official after Liverpool were given a penalty in the first half

Leicester manager Nigel Pearson believes video technology would have prevented his side conceding two penalties in their 2-2 draw at Liverpool. 

'I see what everyone sees, things happen very quickly,' said Pearson after the match

'It is going to fuel the debate again about use of technology because we (the Leicester dugout) have the benefit of being able to see it in a few seconds and know what has happened and it is unfortunate to have to deal with two occasions like that in the first half.

'I am not going to go down the route of being ultra-critical because at the end of the day the game could be a lot easier by utilising what is available to us, but we don't.'

On Simpson's penalty he added: 'It hit his hand but it is how the rules are interpreted and whether there is a level of consistency.

Referee Jones awarded the controversial penalty

Hapless referee Mike Jones started the new year as he refereed throughout the old one by awarding Liverpool a penalty when the ball appeared to hit Leicester's Wes Morgan on the head as he slid to block Raheem Sterling's cross. 

Jones clearly thought that the ball had hit the arm of Morgan but replays showed that was not the case. 

Referees are told that it can be understandable if they miss incidents but it is not acceptable to give something that has not happened. 

'You can see from the player's reaction it is unintentional but I fully accept it hits his hand.

'There were other occasions at both ends where you could say if that one is given why aren't the others.

'This is the problem the game has. It exposes human beings to making errors - that is not a criticism of the officials but we could make it much easier for everyone concerned if technology was utilised.

'It takes a couple of seconds. Even when the whistle has gone and players are remonstrating with the officials it could be reviewed instantaneously.

'It (introduction of technology) is not inevitable but do I think it should be there, yes.'
