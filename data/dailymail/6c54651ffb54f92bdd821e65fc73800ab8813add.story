A major victory was scored over the wind farm lobby yesterday when plans to build giant turbines near one of the nation’s finest Elizabethan gardens were halted.

A High Court judge ruled that preserving historic settings was of greater importance than meeting renewable energy targets.

Mrs Justice Lang said the bid to build four 430ft high turbines at Barnwell Manor on farmland owned by the Queen’s cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, was legally flawed.

The future: The National Trust criticised plans to build a wind farm next to Lyveden New Bield in Northamptonshire

Protests: Peter Stephens, chairman of Stop Barnwell Wind Farm Committee - which opposed the development - at Lyveden New Bield

The structures would have 
overshadowed Lyveden New Bield in Northamptonshire, which has one of 
England’s oldest garden landscapes and features an unfinished  
17th-century Tudor garden lodge.

The battle to save it was led by the 
National Trust and English Heritage, who hailed the ruling as a 
significant victory. Conservationists had warned approval would 
undermine the protection of other important sites.

Peter Nixon, National Trust director 
of conservation, said: ‘It is a huge judgement in favour of conserving 
our historic landscapes.’

The charity is opposing or monitoring
around 25 applications for wind farms amid concern over their impact on
the countryside or heritage sites. Mr Nixon said yesterday’s ruling 
would strengthen its hand in future battles.

‘It sends an important signal that 
areas of outstanding beauty or national significance need protecting and
are unsuitable for these developments,’ he said. ‘Although it is not a 
legal precedent, this can only help.’

English Heritage chief executive 
Simon Thurley said: ‘We are very pleased. The effect of the turbines on 
one of the most important,  beautiful and unspoilt Elizabethan 
landscapes in England would be appalling.’

This week, Trust chairman Sir Simon 
Jenkins said communities were complaining almost daily of a wind farm or
housing  proposal in a sensitive landscape.

Mrs Justice Lang ruled that a 
planning inspector had failed to ‘accord special weight’ or importance 
to ‘the desirability of preserving the setting’. She said the case must 
now be reconsidered.

The Barnwell Manor wind farm was 
rejected by the district council in 2010 after strong local opposition. 
But after the developers appealed, public inquiry inspector Paul  
Griffiths approved it in March last year,  saying green targets must 
come first.

Maf Smith, deputy chief executive of 
RenewableUK, which represents the wind farm industry, denied a precedent
has been set as proposals are dealt with case by case.
