As she prepares to scale back her duties, it appears the Queen is preparing to apply the same dedication to her leisure pursuits as she has a lifetime of public service.

She braved grey skies and drizzle today to make a third appearance at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in Berkshire today.

As one of Britain's most high-profile equestrian enthusiasts, it is perhaps no surprise that the damp weather failed to deter the Queen from attending the Marathon Competition on day four of the event at Windsor Castle.

On Wednesday the 87-year-old monarch delivered a speech at the State Opening of Parliament watched by her son Prince Charles, who attended the ceremony for the first time in 17 years.

His presence has been widely interpreted as an indication that the Queen is set to hand over more of her duties to her son.

Tellingly, the Queen travelled straight from the ceremony at Westminster to Windsor for day one of the horse show, swapping her State finery for a raincoat and an Hermes scarf to cover her hair.

She stuck to similarly sensible outdoor attire today, wearing the same navy raincoat, by Royal warranted label Musto (for whom Zara has designed a collection) and another colourful printed scarf.
