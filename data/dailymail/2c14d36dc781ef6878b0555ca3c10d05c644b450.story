The player who two years ago declared his desire to stay at Arsenal forever is set to become only the seventh to leave the club for Manchester United. Thomas Vermaelen is expected to put pen to paper on a transfer that is almost as curious as it is rare.

It is understood that the Belgian defender has agreed verbally to terms worth £100,000-a-week to join Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford, with a fee of less than £10million mooted for the 28-year-old.

The passage for such a move – not as contentious as Robin van Persie’s a couple of years back but surprising nonetheless – has been partially cleared by Vermaelen sharing an agent with Van Persie and, with only one year remaining on his deal, Vermaelen is believed to want a change.

After five rather up and down years at Arsenal, he has found himself down the pecking order. Per Mertesacker has emerged into a quality centre-half after initial, significant doubts that he could adapt to the pace of England’s top division.

Arsene Wenger has tended to use Laurent Koscielny alongside him, meaning Arsenal’s captain has been in the strange position of commanding respect but not holding a place in the team.

Wenger is believed to want to keep him, but the trends for Vermaelen have largely convinced him to make a move.

He made 33 Premier League appearances in his first season after joining from Ajax, but missed large chunks of 2010 and 2011 with an Achilles problem. He recovered to reclaim his place in the side, and resumed his threat as a goal-scoring centre-half, but last season played only 14 top-flight games, seven of which were starts, and was often used on the left.

All of which might make him seem a curious choice for United, as they look to rebuild the centre of their defence following the fantastic pairing of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand.

Ferdinand is currently without a club having apparently come to the end of a long line at the top of the top level, while Vidic has been handed a lucrative deal at Inter Milan. At the time the move was agreed, David Moyes said it was a move that suited both parties, though there are plenty who disagree.

Now it looks as though Vermaelen will step into the breach. Van Gaal doesn’t tend to get much wrong, by all accounts, so it will be fascinating to see what kind of impact Vermaelen makes if and when a fee is agreed.
