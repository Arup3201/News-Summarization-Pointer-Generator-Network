Australia's resolution condemning the downing of flight MH17 and demanding full access to the site from investigators has been unanimously adopted by the UN Security Council.

Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop told the UN Security Council that the MH17 crash was an 'outrage', she also condemned the 'grotesque violations' at the crash site, reported the ABC.

The UN Security Council unanimouslyÂ  supported the resolution at 5am (AEST) today in New York.

It was thought Russia might veto the resolution after they took umbrage with the phrase 'shooting down', but they supported the resolution after changing part of the wording.

Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop speaks during a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. The UN Security Council voted this morning to condemn the downing of the plane and demanded full and unfettered access to the crash site

Ms Bishop said the vote was 'an unambiguous response from the international community on an utterly deplorable act,' reported the ABC.

'The victims must be treated with dignity. It is despicable that this access is not being provided. It is an affront to the victims and their families,' she said.

The bodies of the MH17 victims, including the 37 Australians killed in the disaster, will be transferred to Amsterdam as soon as possible, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk says.

Some 250 bodies are currently being kept in refrigerated train cars in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine, but Mr Yatsenyuk said 'bloody guerrillas don't allow the train to leave' the station at Torez.

Tony Abbott revealed he has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin who had 'said all the right things' and would be held to his word

But when they do, the Ukrainian government plans to send the bodies to the Netherlands.

'We are ready to transfer all the bodies directly to Amsterdam as one of the best well-equipped forensic laboratories is located in Amsterdam,' Mr Yatsenyuk told reporters in Kiev.

The Netherlands will lead the investigation working with the international community and Ukrainian authorities to identify the victims.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said former Defence Chief Angus Houston would lead Australia's efforts on the ground to recover, identify and repatriate the dead.

The Australian Government has deployed 45 officials to assist, including 20 from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 20 Australian Federal Police Officers, two Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigators and three Defence officials.

International investigators were starting to get more access to the crash site, but still not enough, according to Mr Abbott

Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 is believed to have been blown out of the sky last Thursday by a surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 passengers and crew.

International investigators were starting to get more access to the crash site, but still not enough, according to Mr Abbott.

'This is still an absolutely shambolic situation,' Mr Abbott said.

Mr Abbott revealed he has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin who had 'said all the right things' and would be held to his word.

The Prime Minister has also started contacting the families of the 37 Australians killed in the MH17 disaster, adding that the families may never come to terms with their loss.

'These are families in very difficult circumstances, numb with grief and only beginning to come to terms with their loss,' he said.

'I don't want to cause anyone any individual grief but I want them to know the Prime Minister is available to them at any time.'

Mr Abbott has been the most vocal of any world leader in repeatedly accusing Russia of trying to wash its hands of the disaster, and failing to properly secure the crash site.

His priority is to do 'the right thing' by the Australian victims and their families by ensuring bodies are treated with respect, the crash site is secured and a thorough investigation undertaken.

'Then of course, we have to punish the guilty,' he said.

'We have to do our best to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice.'

Mr Abbott said he had a productive conversation with his Russian counterpart, who assured the Australian Prime Minister he would do the right things by the victims' families

Mr Abbott said while there had been some signs of improvement, including Ukrainian government officials gaining some access to the site, the situation was still completely unacceptable.

'The site is being treated more like a garden clean-up than a forensic investigation,' he said.

'The wreckage has been picked over, it's been trashed, it's been trampled.'

Mr Abbott said an Australian military aircraft was on standby to 'play our part to ensure that we get justice for the dead and closure for the living'.

Ms Bishop said the government was committed to returning the bodies of the victims to their families.

'They have been murdered and the Australian government will not rest until we're able to bring the bodies home to the Australian families who are waiting for them,' she said.

Memorial services have been held across Australia in the days following the crash and tributes have flowed in honour of the 37 victims.

Among them on Monday were students at a NSW primary school who silently shed tears as they left flowers and messages in front of a memorial to former deputy principal Michael Clancy and his wife Carol.

Mr Clancy only retired last year after 22 years as a teacher and deputy principal at Albion Park Public School, south of Wollongong.

'To Mr Clancy, Mrs Clancy. We will all miss you. I wish R.I.P. meant "Return in peace". You will always be in my heart. Love from Ella,' a student wrote on heart-shaped paper.

Tributes also flowed from colleagues of Sydney kindergarten teacher Gabriele Lauschet.

Ms Lauschet, known as Gaby to her friends and colleagues, was due to start the school term on Monday at the German International School in Sydney's north where she had taught for 14 years.

'Everyone's reminded of Gaby... it's not easy to come back to work, this environment and know that she's gone,' Principal Erhad Seifert said.

To add to the heartbreak, the 47-year-old German national had only months earlier become engaged to another staff member, the school's business manager Andreas Schaaf.
