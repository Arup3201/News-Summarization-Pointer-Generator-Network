If you packed a cardigan for a day out yesterday, you might be able to leave it behind today.

Temperatures are forecast to peak at a rather warm 20C (68F), right on cue for Bank Holiday Monday.

Yesterday glorious sunshine sent the average UK temperature creeping up from a cool 12C (54F) earlier in the week to 18C (64F) in many parts of the country, including Aberdeen, while Bristol enjoyed highs of 16C (61F).

Families flocked to the coast in Brighton and Dorset, while roads were gridlocked in Llandudno, North Wales, as day trippers made their way home from the seaside resort.

Figures from Asda suggested the 
sunshine inspired a wave of impromptu barbecues, with sales of sausages 
and equipment expected to triple those of April.

The fine weather was not evenly spread, however, according to a forecaster from the Met Office.

'Large
 swathes of England, Wales and southern parts of Scotland had good 
spells of sunshine but further north and west there was thicker cloud 
producing outbreaks of rain,' he said.

'Today
 there is likely to be  an east/west split with the best  sunshine in 
the south-eastern parts  of England from London up to  Lincoln, and 
temperatures will reach 20 or 21C (68-70F).'

Outbreaks of rain from the west to the east are expected to arrive in the evening and could carry on into Tuesday.

Yesterday,
 with no work till Tuesday and clear blue skies and temperatures nudging
 the mid teens in the South and East, children and adults were out 
playing in the parks and flocking to the coasts.

Dozens of boats lined the waterways, bearing bright bunting as passers-by stopped to enjoy the spectacle

But
 it wasn't quite yet warm enough for serious sunbathing and, although 
there were ice creams aplenty, many were still taking precautions with 
hats and jackets.

In 
Bournemouth, East Sussex, children were out playing by the sea, building
 sandcastles and dipping their toes into the still chilly waters despite
 a stiff breeze.

Bursts of 
colour blanketed Kent, meanwhile, as powdery blue carpets of bluebells 
shone in almost celestial light of the glorious early morning sun.

 John Turp snapped the plants, which have been voted Britain's 
favourite, in two locations near his home in the county.

'I
 was fortunate to stumble across some bluebells outside of Woodchurch by
 accident,' he said. 'They inspired me to find more and I visited the 
Hucking Estate a week late and found this beautiful carpet of flowers.

'I love how the almost unnatural blue stands out against the woodland green.'

But the change in weather, while almost universally welcome, has come with warnings. Nature lovers have begged holidaymakers not to get too close to huge but harmless basking sharks which are moving close to beaches on the West Country coastline.

The docile monsters of the deep, which can reach 30ft in length and weigh up to eight tonnes, drift round just below the surface with their vast 4ft wide jaws wide open as a net to catch millions of microscopic plankton, their staple food.

Shark fins have been spotted cleaving the water, with this spring's first sightings close to the shore at Porthcurno and near Mount's Bay in Penzance, Cornwall.

Today wildlife tour operator Marine Discovery, based in Penzance, urged excited and curious holidaymakers to take great care when they spot basking shark cruising lazily in shallow water.

'We're now getting into the time of year when basking sharks can be found feeding off the Cornish coast and it's fantastic to see them,' said a spokesman.

'But it's important to remember that they need to be approached carefully so as not to disturb their natural behaviour.

'If a shark thrashes its tail and dives or stops feeding and dives, then it is likely you have disturbed it. If this happens learn from the mistake and try not to repeat it.'

In Bristol people enjoyed an interactive temporary art installation, the Park and Slide project in the city centre

Meanwhile, in Cambridge, university officials have urged students to boycott a notorious annual booze-up today in the city's Jesus Green park.

'Caesarian Sunday' attracts thousands of students every year who dress up and play drinking games. But locals and visitors have been upset as the historic riverside park has been left littered with rubbish, empty bottles and vomit.

After years of complaints university officials are calling on students to shun today's event. A University spokesman said: 'The Colleges will be asking students preferably not to attend but if they do to be considerate of others and avoid any behaviour which may cause offence.' 

The three-day forecast: Temperatures will increase tomorrow, but a band of rain moving in from the west will gradually cover the country and sit there for the rest of the week

But with a fine afternoon and evening expected, it may be difficult to dissuade Britons from making the most of the springtime sun.

Calum McColl, a forecaster with the Met Office, told MailOnline that for much of England and Wales 'there's some good weather to be had.'

Although cloud is still overshadowing central and northern parts of the country, many inland areas will enjoy temperatures of up to 15C even as far north as Sheffield.

The best of the sun will be in the South and the East, particularly around coastal areas, which will nevertheless be slighter cooler under the influence of the sea breeze.

Overnight the clear skies over these areas will lead to a frost and a chilly morning, but May Day bank holiday temperatures tomorrow will then increase up to 18C in London and surrounding areas, with much of the rest of the country also enjoying a 'pretty good day'.

However, rain will start moving into western parts over the course of the day, bringing with it colder temperatures and heavier cloud cover.

'There's a little bit of a change coming into western areas,' said Mr McColl. 'There is a band of rain coming through.'

By Tuesday, rain will advance across much of the country, with summery weather holding out only in the far west, in an outlook that looks likely to persist for the rest of the week.
