A convicted killer who was out on bail broke into his girlfriend's house, killed her and made a macabre meal out of her heart, lungs and brains, police said.

Joseph Oberhansley, 33, allegedly forced his way into the home of his partner Tammy Jo Blanton, 46, in Jeffersonville, Indiana, on Thursday.

Officers found Blanton dead under a tarpaulin in the bathroom of her home, with fatal injuries to her head, neck and torso, according to a police affidavit.

The statement added that they found a plate covered in blood and bone, as well as bloodied cooking implements, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported.

An arrest report seen by Wave 3 News said that Oberhansley admitted to police that he had cooked and eaten parts of his lover's brains.

Officers had been called to the house early that morning after it was reported  

Oberhansley appeared in court today but claimed to be somebody else and told the Clark County Court 'you've got the wrong guy'.

He was charged with with murder, abuse of a corpse and breaking and entering, but denied all of them.

Over the weekend it emerged that Oberhansley had already been bailed for choking a man and leading police on a chase into the next state.

Prosecutors had asked for a $25,000 bail to be set before he could be released again, but this was lowered to $5,000, allowing him to be released for $500.

Oberhansley has served time for killing before. He was convicted of the manslaughter of his teenage girlfriend in 1998. She had just given birth to his son.

He was released from prison for that felony in 2012.
