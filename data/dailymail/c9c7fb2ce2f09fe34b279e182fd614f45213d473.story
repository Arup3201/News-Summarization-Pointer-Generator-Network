With energy costs continuing to rise, a New York firm has created a way of powering small household appliances using sports equipment.

Each time a player kicks the Soccket football, a built-in mechanism converts the kinetic energy into an electrical charge.

This charge can then be used to power specially-designed lights, as well as other small appliances, via a built-in USB port.

Soccket, pictured, is a foam football covered in leather. Each time the ball is kicked, a pendulum inside moves and as this pendulum swings, it turns a generator connected to a rechargeable battery. Specially-designed lights, pictured, can then be connected to the ball via USB port. Soccket costs $99 (£60)

Each time the ball is kicked, a pendulum (pictured) inside the ball moves.

As
 this pendulum swings, it turns a generator connected to a rechargeable 
battery.

This stored energy can be used to power a small light, 
plugged into the ball using a USB port.

This USB port can also be used to connect other items, including phones, to the device. 

Half an hour of play provides three hours of light, for example.

The Soccket project was originally a Kickstarter campaign set up by New York-based firm Uncharted Play. 

The company set a target of $75,000 (£45,600) and achieved a total of $92,296 (£56,100) by the time the campaign closed in March.

Soccket uses the firm’s patented G-Kick technology.

Each time the ball is kicked, a pendulum inside it swings, and these swings turn a generator connected to a rechargeable battery. 

This stored energy can be used to power a small light, plugged into the ball using a USB port.

This USB port can also be used to connect
 other small household items, including phone chargers, to the device.

According to Uncharted Play, half an hour of kicking the ball 
provides three hours of power.

The ball is made of foam and leather and never needs to be inflated. It is also sturdy and can be kicked without damaging the inside. Uncharted Play has already tested the ball in communities across South Africa and Mexico, and said the technology is ideal for areas with poor electricity networks

The
 ball is made of foam and leather and never needs to be inflated. It is 
also sturdy and can be kicked without damaging the inside, claims the company. 

Uncharted Play has already tested the ball in poor communities across South Africa, Mexico and Brazil and said the technology is ideal for areas with basic electrical networks. 

Soccket balls are available from the Uncharted Play website for $99 (£60) each.

The company have also created the Pulse skipping rope, which harnesses kinetic energy in a similar way to the Soccket, but can instead be used to power small applications and charge mobile phones.
