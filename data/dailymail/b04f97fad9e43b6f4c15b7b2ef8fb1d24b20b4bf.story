Defensively against Swansea, Manchester United were all over the place. But forget three at the back or four at the back. They could play any system they want but it would make no difference — the players are just not good enough.

So much has been said about Louis van Gaal and how he is going to take the 3-5-2 that worked so well with Holland at the World Cup and use it with United. 

But I’m already sick of talking about systems. It doesn’t matter what formation United play, it’s about the quality of the players and at United that quality is sorely lacking at the moment.

Problems: Louis van Gaal has brought a new system to Manchester United, but they need new players

It sounds simplistic, but how many of the United team who started on Sunday would get into the Man City or Chelsea teams? Maybe Wayne Rooney at a push, but that’s about it.

In a way having a decent pre-season was the worst thing that could have happened to Van Gaal as all it did was raise expectations. The good news for him, though, is that he still has time to bring in some new faces, but who is going to want to come in?

The way United are at the minute you could get Van Gaal, Bob Paisley and Jose Mourinho to manage them together and even they would have a job getting them back into the top four.

Ramsey can become Arsenal's Lampard

Before he broke his leg in 2010, Aaron Ramsey was talked about as one of the best young players in Britain. He is truly living up to that billing.

Arsenal did not play that well against Crystal Palace but Ramsey is starting to become like their own Frank Lampard. Frank was so good at scoring vital goals for Chelsea, particularly late on. Now Ramsey is doing the same. He’s full of confidence and he is like a magnet to the ball in the area.

He is a phenomenal athlete, as his running stats below show. He covered more ground than any other player in the game and that energy and athleticism is why he is finding himself in the right place at the right time so often.

City have to keep their spine solid

Of all the top sides to play this weekend, Man City looked the most accomplished. They had the trickiest fixture away at Newcastle but still had more than enough quality to put them away.

Lots of people have tipped Chelsea to win it this season but City will make a much better fist of retaining the title than they did the last time they won it.

The key for City is keeping the spine of their team fit. Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, David Silva and Sergio Aguero only started five Premier League games together last season, but City still won the trophy.

If they can keep those boys playing, there is no reason why they can’t go on to defend it this time around.

Saints to survive

After the firesale on the south coast this summer, plenty of people expect Southampton to be battling relegation. They will be fine.

Victor Wanyama is a beast in midfield, Morgan Schneiderlin is an asset if he stays and James Ward-Prowse is an excellent young player. Nobody expects them to do as well as last season but they proved at Anfield they are still a good side and they were unlucky to lose.

Credit to Villa

There were some impressive results over the weekend and Aston Villa’s win at Stoke was the second best of the lot, only behind Swansea's victory at Old Trafford.

Everybody would have had them down to get beaten three or four-nil but they were set up perfectly, so credit to Paul Lambert and Roy Keane.

At Villa Park last year the pressure suffocated them but on the road they are free to sit back and counter.

Vital start: Villa took a surprising three points away from Stoke, with many tipping them to go down

Penalty problems

It was not a good weekend for penalty takers. Mark Noble missed his first penalty in years for West Ham and Charlie Austin missed the chance to get a vital point on the board for QPR.

I missed one or two in my career, but I’ve never understood why players try to place the ball. It’s OK if you send the keeper the wrong way, but if he guesses right you give him a chance with a weaker shot.

Sometimes it’s just better to put your foot through it!

Bring on Burnley

We all know what to expect from Chelsea on Monday night, but I think a lot of people are going to enjoy watching Burnley this year.

Sean Dyche has done brilliantly to get them back in the Premier League and I like the way they play their football.

Keep an eye out for Kieran Trippier and Danny Ings, two youngsters set to impress.

At 23, Trippier could go on to be an England right back. He is a good crosser of the ball, is good at set-pieces at both ends of the pitch and he takes a good free-kick. As for Ings, he is a real livewire and after 26 goals last season he means business.

Excitement: Sean Dyche faces his first test as a Premier League manager... against Chelsea

2 - Crystal Palace might have wished Tony Pulis had stuck around a little longer after their opening-day defeat by Arsenal. Both goals they conceded at the Emirates came from set-pieces, but in 26 Premier League games under Pulis last season, Palace let in only one from set-plays.

3 - Formerly known for their steely defence, Stoke have become a bit leaky of late. Mark Hughes’s side have managed to keep only three clean sheets in their last 23 Premier League matches.

Rooney is edging closer to Henry's number

174 - Wayne Rooney scored his 174th Premier League goal. He is now just one short of Thierry Henry in the all-time list. 

7 - Some players are clearly more comfortable playing away from home and Gylfi Sigurdsson is one of them. Seven of his eight Premier League goals for Swansea have come on the road.

6 - Steven Naismith has become a useful player for Everton. The Scot has been involved in six goals in his past nine games, scoring four and setting up two.

22 - Luis Suarez was the main man at Liverpool last season but Daniel Sturridge’s goals were more valuable. Including last season and Sunday’s strike against Southampton, Sturridge’s goals have been worth 22 points to Liverpool. 

84 - It was not the debut Tyler Blackett would have had in mind, but the young Man United defender completed more passes than any other player in the 2-1 defeat by Swansea.
