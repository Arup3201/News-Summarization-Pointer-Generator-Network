The widow of a fusilier shot dead on a training exercise has told of her disgust after it emerged the soldiers who killed her husband will be released from prison today and be allowed to rejoin the army.

Newlywed James Wilkinson, 21, was killed by machine gun fire during a mock battle in training with the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in Kenya in 2011.

Last summer Corporal Colin Bell, 30, and Staff Sergeant Patrick Price, 43, were given sentences of 14 months and 21 months respectively at a court martial for negligently performing a duty.

Distraught: Sarah Wilkinson has blasted the appeals granted for the servicemen that shot her husband James in mock battle in Kenya in 2011

They had been married for four months when Private Wilkinson was killed. Sarah was pregnant with their daughter Annabelle, now aged two. James helped her bring up her first son Connor (all pictured together)

Private Wilkinson’s widow, Sarah, spoke of her horror that the two men were yesterday granted appeals against their sentences.

Their orders barring them from the army were quashed and the judge reduced them both to the rank of private.

Mrs
 Wilkinson, 23, said: ‘I’m absolutely shocked and disgusted that the men
 responsible for taking my husband’s life are being let back into the 
army like they have done no wrong.

‘Their
 original sentence was not harsh and if they had any respect for James 
or any compassion for my children and I they would have just kept their 
heads down and got on with it.’

The couple had been married for four 
months when Private Wilkinson was killed and Mrs Wilkinson was pregnant 
with their daughter Annabelle, now aged two, at the time.

He had helped raise her son Connor, now aged four, from a previous relationship, whom he treated as a son of his own.

Private Wilkinson was killed by a machine gun, which went off in the hands of Colin Bell, 30

Widow Sarah claims Bell and Patrick Price, who was supervising, wouldn't rejoin if they had compassion for her

‘They didn’t just take one life that day, they took several,’ she said.

‘I will always love James with all my heart and I will never forgive anyone involved for letting him die in vain.

'I hope people question who some of the heroes of our country are. I know I would die before I let my son serve with these irresponsible men.’

Private Wilkinson died when a malfunctioning machine gun accidentally fired.

Price supervised the exercise and Bell was holding the weapon when it went off.

Mrs Wilkinson criticised the decision to release Bell and Price from prison and to allow them to rejoin the army.

She said: 'I will never get over losing my husband. I will never accept that there is no justice'

‘I will never get over losing my husband. I will never accept that there is no justice. I just wish they could accept the consequences of their actions.

‘I want to be honest with my children as they grow up.

'Before at least I could tell them that the men who killed their dad were punished for what they did, but now they have the anguish of knowing the men can continue to represent our country with pride.’

Appeal judge, Lord Justice Pitchford, said reducing their ranks was sufficient but dismissed Price’s appeal against his conviction.

‘While we accept that the consequence of the appellants’ negligence was both extremely serious and tragic, we do not concur in the view that these offences could be regarded as at or near the most serious of their kind,’ he said.

‘In our judgment, theirs was not a reckless disregard for safety but a failure under pressure of circumstances to recognise a danger which, in other circumstances, would have been clear to them.’
