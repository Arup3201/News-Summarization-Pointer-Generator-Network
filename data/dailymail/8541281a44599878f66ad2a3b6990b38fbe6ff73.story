Gut-busting: Dave Cossar (left) and Justin Meaney put the bun on Britains biggest burger

With enough beef to make 100 quarter pounders and containing a gut-busting 25,000 calories, whoever ends up with this for their tea will definitely be starting their diet another day.

Nestled between two 20-inch buns and drizzled with 4lb of melted cheese, the mega meal weighs 25lb and took two men to lift it.

But no-one can accuse the creative chefs behind the meat-feast of failing to provide a balanced diet - it also contains 20 sliced tomatoes and a pound of salad leaves.

The vegetarians' worst nightmare was rustled up by chefs at Plymouth restaurant JD's Grill, and has 'flame-grilled' its way into the record books as Britain's biggest burger, beating the previous holder's 24lb effort.

It took more than two hours to cook and had to be roasted in an oven because it was too big to fit in a conventional frying pan.

Owner Dave Cossar plans to chop it into sections to share it with customers rather than sell it as a whole burger.

He said: 'It is a monster. It is not bulked up with anything - it is absolutely 100 per cent pure beef, with herbs and seasoning.'

Chef Justin Meaney and staff at the American-themed restaurant did a trial run a couple of weeks ago to see if they had what it took to take the record.

But they have some way to go before they are able to compete with the mighty meateaters of Minnesota.

Last year an eatery in the US state made a burger that weighed one ton.Â
