Cheap eats: Customers who buy the cheapest food at the supermarket are most at danger from contaminated meat, says Waitrose boss Mark Price

Customers who buy the cheapest food at the supermarket are most at danger from contaminated meat, says Waitrose boss Mark Price.

The chief executive of the supermarket chain said that meat should be more thoroughly checked and its origins verified to keep consumers confident in the food they are eating.

His comments come as the Food Standards Agency’s test results were due in for some of Britain’s suppliers, brewers and restaurant chains.

The watchdog said 2,501 tests were 
conducted on beef products, with 29 results were positive for undeclared 
horsemeat at or above 1 per cent.

Mr
Price maintains that Waitrose has done proper testing and origin checks
of its products and so has not been affected by the horsemeat scandal.

He
wrote in The Sunday Telegraph: ‘If meat is being purchased blind from 
outside the UK, and sometimes even via the internet in bulk, it is less 
easy to find those guarantees that full knowledge and traceability 
give. 

‘If, at the same 
time, there is a requirement to hit a price point for consumers under 
financial pressure then there will be an inevitable strain in the supply
chain.’

Mr Price said the 
cost of rearing animals and the often long supply route could also put 
pressure to keep companies afloat or allow officials to give in to personal greed.

He hoped the scandal would open up debate on food economics and lead to a shakeup of meat testing procedures to ensure consumer confidence in the product.

Birmingham-based supplier 2 Sisters Food Group is among those waiting on test results. Their customers include major chains such as Harrods, Marks & Spencer, Asda and Pret A Manger.

FSA chief executive Catherine Brown said that testing was the right way to address the issue, and said the focus would be on areas of higher risk.

But she admitted that the number of people who had unknowingly eaten horsemeat was likely to be impossible to ascertain.

‘I don't think that we ever will (know how many), because these tests are a snapshot, so even where we find things it is very hard to work out how long, what number of batches, so I think it is unlikely that we will ever know that. It is shocking,' she told the BBC.

Her comments came as the head of a major UK supermarket chain insisted that the horse meat scandal was not 'the tip of an iceberg'.

Justin King, chief executive of Sainsbury's told BBC's Newsnight programme that supermarkets had not been slow to react to the scandal, but conceded there was a long way to go before the food industry could fully explain how the crisis has come about.

The horsemeat scandal has swept across Europe and criminal investigations are being carried out in at least three countries.

In Britain, three men were arrested last week on suspicion of fraud as authorities investigated the possible mislabelling of meat.

One of the men, 63-year-old Peter Boddy,
owns an abattoir in West Yorkshire now under investigation. He also had
a contract with Aintree Racecourse for destroying the carcasses of 
injured horses.

Mr Boddy and the other men were released on bail yesterday pending further police inquiries.

Warnings about horsemeat fraud were sent to the FSA but no action was taken, the Sunday Telegraph claims.

Tip-off: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has admitted that the Irish received a tip-off of possible contamination of beef

The FSA received three warnings that in Europe beef products were contaminated with horsemeat but the agency decided not to take action because the produce was not intended for Britain.

But the free movement of food within Europe meant that contaminated meat could find its way into the British food chain. Meat imported into Europe from America could have entered the food chain in Britain – contaminated with horse painkiller ‘bute’ which can be dangerous to humans.

Warnings that there was a fraud suspicion regarding horse carcasses and horsemeat from Hungary and Denmark and it was reported that much of the meat had been distributed probably to Belgium, Denmark and France, the Sunday Telegraph claimed.

The watchdog did not act on the warnings because there was no indication that the meat was to be distributed in Britain.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that Irish food safety chiefs kept British consumers in the dark for ten weeks after being tipped off about horsemeat in beefburgers.

Officials have repeatedly insisted that horsemeat was only detected in the food chain after random inspection of products at Irish plants in early November. It was claimed that the results came to light in trials of new DNA testing techniques.

But Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has now admitted the Irish received a tip-off of possible contamination of beef with horsemeat before last year’s tests and started investigating on that basis.
