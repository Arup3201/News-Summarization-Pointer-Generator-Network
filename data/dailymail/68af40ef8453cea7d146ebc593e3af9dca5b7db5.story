A dog was saved by a kind-hearted passersby after it became stuck in a swollen river in flood-hit Bosnia.

The pet was spotted splashing about in the debris strewn waters of the river in Zenica on Thursday.

Two men quickly attempted to usher the dog towards the side of a bank as the dog struggled over mounds of rubbish.

The desperate dog slowly swam to the side where a man grabbed the animal by the scruff of his neck and hoisted him, with the help of another passerby, out of the water.

In the past week, Bosnia and Serbia have been hit by the heaviest rain and floods in the past 120 years with the governments declaring a state of emergency in many towns and cities.

Overflowing rivers have burst into towns and villages, cutting off whole communities, while landslides have buried houses.

At least three people have drowned.

'We had to abort the mission because of the rainfall and winds. The weather is horrible and the helicopter has its limits,' said rescue pilot Fahrudin Memic.

'This is the most difficult mission I have ever participated in.'
