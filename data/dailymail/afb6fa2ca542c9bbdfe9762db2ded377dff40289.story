One of the convicted Bali Nine drug smugglers facing life in an Indonesian prison has spoken of his terror for fellow traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran in an emotional online plea for help. 

Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen was arrested with Chan and Sukumaran in 2005 for his role in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali and into Australia.

In an online campaign to raise funds for a fifth appeal against his life sentence, the 31-year-old describes his anguish for the first time. 

'Today as sit in my jail cell and watch the way the Indonesian government is handling the execution of my fellow Australians I am terrified,' says Nguyen. 

'Terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next.'

Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen has spoken for the first time about his life in prison

'Agonisingly certain I will be next': Tan Duc Thanh Nguyan has launched an emotional plea for help with a MyCause campaign to raise funds  for his legal costs, and those of fellow Bali Nine prisoners in Indonesia

Nguyen was arrested in Bali as a 22-year-old and sentenced to life in prison. 

He's now desperately hoping to raise money through his My Cause campaign to pay the legal costs of his latest appeal, which will be heard with fellow inmates Si Yi Chen and Mathew Norman. 

'By the time you read this there may only be seven of us left,' he writes. 

'With recent events surrounding my friends Andrew Chan and Myuren Sukumaran on death row I fear that the rest of us will never be able to have a fair trial.'

While they are still alive, he says, 'we have hope.' 

Funds raised will be used to cover costs for of all three men, and any remaining money will be donated to support legal costs of the remaining Bali Nine group, also fighting for their lives. 

Nguyen says his family, who run a bakery in Brisbane, have spent all their life savings on his legal costs over the last ten years and are swamped with those debts. 

He said one of his biggest regrets is the shame he has brought to his family and the heartbreak his situation has put them through.

'I live with that regret every single morning when I wake and every night in my noisy bare jail cell as I try to sleep,' he says.

'I now know my decision to take part in this crime meant that not only myself suffers but those around me and those who love me. I am a brother, a son, an uncle and someone’s nephew.' 

The 31-year-old was convicted in 2005 for his involvement in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali

Nguyen has been trying to repair his relationship with his family since being convicted almost 10 years ago, and said he is haunted by the memory of his mother coming to visit him for the first time in prison.

His parents were given asylum in Australia after fleeing Vietnam and taking refuge in the Philippines, where Nguyen was born.

Describing his parents as hard-working and courageous, Nguyen said that he threw away what they fought so hard for and that he will never be able to make it up to them. 

'I tell you now, there isn’t any code of honour among drug dealers and in the end it will destroy you and everyone around you.' 

The Indonesian Supreme Court increased Nguyen's sentence to the death penalty in 2006

Nguyen and his family know well that another appeal could be risky. Following a previous attempt in 2006, the Indonesian Supreme Court increased his sentence to the death penalty, before reducing it again to life in prison in 2008.

'For five years I appealed and never had a chance. During one appeal my sentence changed from life to death,' Nguyen writes. 'But desperation has driven me to try again. A roll of the dice – for my life.'

'Am I guilty? Yes. Am I sorry? More than anyone will ever know.' 

Nguyen, who is currently being held in a jail in Malang, says he was moved from Kerobokan prison because he needed help.  

'I had spiralled into the deepest depression. I hated myself and pushed everyone away. I woke up every day feeling angry that I had woken. Disgusted that I was still alive.' he says. 

Now, he says he is trying his best not to lose hope, waking early each day to train and box at the gym and read. He is also teaching English to other prisoners and encouraging them 'to work through their problems at the gym.'

The hard line stance of Indonesian President Joko Widodo has frightened Nguyen to the point where he believes he may not receive a fair trial, but he says an appeal is his only chance.

The 31-year-old has been through a legal rollercoaster since being sentenced in 2005 (here with fellow Bali Nine members)

Despite international pressure and official protests from the governments of Brazil, Holland, France, the Philippines and Nigeria, Mr Joko has remained unwavering on the executions. 

'No one prefers death. Death is an easy way out. I deserve the suffering I’m going through. But an appeal means hope. Without that hope there isn’t any future,' Nguyen has told the Daily Telegraph. 

His sentiment has been echoed by supporters of Chan and Sukumaran as they await the outcome of their last-ditch appeal. 

The appeals were adjourned until next week, and Australian authorities have continued to negotiate with the Indonesian government for clemency and life imprisonment for the pair.

High profile Indonesian authorities have reportedly urged President Joko to reconsider the executions, amid concerns that if the executions go ahead the nation's reputation will be tarnished.

'Cracks are showing. They know that after these executions, there are many more to come,' one source, who asked to remain anonymous, told Fairfax. 

'I’m terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next,' Nguyen said of Chan and Sukumaran

Nguyen has  been watching the fate of the condemned Bali Nine ringleaders very closely as he prepares to launch another appeal

Nguyen is currently  sharing a cell in Malang with fellow Bali Nine drug mule Martin Stephens, and has been in close contact with his friend Scott Rush, whom he enlisted as part of the smuggling plot.

Rush was found with 1.3 kilograms of heroin strapped to his body when he was just 19, and has struggled with drugs since his conviction.

Nguyen said that it has been terrible to see his friend 'destroy himself'.  

The 31-year-old is preparing to launch his fifth appeal as Chan and Sukumaran wait for the outcome of their latest appeal, and said that he hopes desperately their lives don't end by execution.
