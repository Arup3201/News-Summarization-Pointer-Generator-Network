Campaigners against the £34billion HS2 rail project  yesterday won their fight for higher compensation.

The High Court ruled that a consultation on payouts for thousands of blighted homes was ‘so unfair as to be unlawful’.

Objections from protesters were not ‘conscientiously considered’ by ministers, according to a judge.

The Government will now have to hold the £3.6million consultation again and bills picked up by the taxpayer could soar.

The decision was hailed as a stunning 
victory for ‘Middle England’ and for the High Speed 2 Action Alliance, 
which comprises more than 70 action and residents’ associations.

The court heard that around 172,000 
homes within 0.6 miles of the first phase of the line from London to  
Birmingham are affected by ‘HS2 blight’. However some campaigners put 
the figure as high as 350,000 with a compensation bill of around 
£2.5billion.

The Government won nine other cases 
yesterday relating to the plan to run 225mph trains from London to the 
Midlands and beyond in a  Y-shaped route to Leeds and Manchester.

Under the compensation scheme, those 
living in a ‘safeguarded zone’ within 60 metres of the line will receive
 a package involving the unblighted value of their property plus 10 per 
cent and moving costs.

Outside this zone there are a number 
of less generous discretionary compensation schemes including for those 
living between 60 metres and 120 metres from the line.

The HS2 plan has proved unpopular with many and questions have been raised about the benefits it will bring

An ‘exceptional hardship’ scheme 
exists for those who can prove they are forced to move. The scheme has 
provoked a revolt in Tory heartlands because it runs through areas of 
outstanding natural beauty, including the Chilterns and parts of 
Warwickshire.

Allowing the challenge by HS2AA, Mr 
Justice Ouseley ruled: ‘All in all, the consultation on compensation was
 so unfair as to be unlawful.’

David Wolfe QC, appearing for HS2AA, 
argued successfully that tens of thousands of people who ‘just happen to
 live and own properties’ along the high-speed route faced loss of value
 on their homes and being unable to move or remortgage for 15 years or 
more.

The nine legal claims rejected by the 
judge included attacks on the manner in which the project had been 
steered through Parliament and alleged breaches of EU environmental and 
habitat directives.

Ministers say the 351-mile scheme – 
which won’t be completed until 2033 – is in the national interest, will 
regenerate the North, boost jobs and help Britain compete in the world. 
Journey times will be cut.

Rail minister Simon Burns said: ‘This is a major landmark victory for HS2 and the future of Britain.

‘The judge has categorically given the green light for the Government to press ahead without delay.’

Campaigners against the high speed rail link claimed today's judgement was a 'huge victory'.

Ministers
 had provoked fury when they described 
thousands of middle class homeowners alarmed that their properties were 
suddenly worthless as selfish ‘Nimbys’ – the acronym for ‘Not in My Back
 Yard’ .  It was claimed they were putting their own family interests ahead of the 
national interest.

Speaking following today's judgement, Richard
 Stein, who 
represented High Speed 2 Action Alliance, expressed delight at the victory.

Anger: The plans for the new high speed rail line has angered 'Middle England'. These posters are found in the village of Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire

Mr 
Stein said: 'This was never a Nimby argument. Many thousands of people 
living along the route will not be able to sell their homes for some 15 
years because their homes are blighted.

‘They should not have to bear the burden for this national project.

'We
 hope now that proper arrangements are put in place by the Government 
for compensation for those who live by the proposed HS2 route to make it
 possible for them to move if and when they wish, in the same way that 
the rest of us can.’

Councillor Martin Tett, leader of the
 51M Alliance of 18 local authorities which have joined forces to oppose the 
first stage of the route as far as Birmingham, said they were likely to lodge appeals on some of the points on 
which they had lost today.

‘People are angry,’ he said.

HS2AA spokesman Richard Houghton said it was estimated that more than 300,000 households faced blight from phases one and two of the high-speed project and would need compensation: ’We don't have a value for what the compensation bill will be’.
