Pen pal: Magnotta is writing to letters from 'fans' in his Montreal jail cell

Cannibal killer Luka Magnotta is being sent fan mail to his prison cell where he has been responding to supporters.

Magnotta, 31, is being held in the medical wing of the Riviere-des-Prairies Detention Centre in Montreal, Quebec as he awaits trial next September for the brutal murder and dismemberment of student Jun Lin in May 2012.

Following the slaying of his lover, Magnotta is accused of having sex with the dismembered corpse before mailing body parts to Canadian political parties.

Mail has been flooding in from around the world for the disturbed killer with a special fan site set up to instruct supporters on the correct way to contact him.

The former porn actor is reportedly being well-fed and gets time out of his cell which he spends sitting alone in a communal area.

He
 has been visited by his mother and called by his grandmother, reports revealed.

There is 
also the piles of mail Magnotta receives from strangers around the 
world, according to the Toronto Sun.

Magnotta 
takes the time to respond to fans, even offering advice to their 
problems as he has a 'compassionate side', his friend John McKeller told
 the Sun.

Delusional: A fan site dedicated to the crazed killer was set up to show 'fans' how to write letters to Magnotta

A blog entitled Luka Magnotta Dedication posted the murderer's prison address and tips on how to get letters passed by tight jail security.

'Fans' are told to use bright cards to catch Magnotta's eye and reminded that he has a particular preference for animal prints. 

Supporters are also told to avoid talking about his murder case and 'compliment his appearance -  The most important thing to him!'

Although fans are told by the site not to expect a reply, Magnotta is still likely to welcome the letters.

The last post by the blogger was in December 2012, as the individual no longer feels Magnotta deserving of sympathy, writing 'he is a liar and manipulator'.

Officials in the Canadian province 
have said that it is not against the law for inmates to receive mail but
 letters they receive are subject to a strict set of regulations.

Magnotta's legal team have refused to speak to the media about his case.

The trial of a former porn actor is set to begin in September 2014 and is expected to last six to eight weeks. Magnotta has pleaded not guilty to the slaying of Lin. 

He is accused of killing the university student and posting a video online that shows him stabbing and having sex with the dismembered corpse.

Magnotta was arrested in June 2012 in Berlin following an international manhunt to track him down.

Magnotta faces five charges in connection with the murder and dismemberment of Lin, a 33-year-old Chinese national studying engineering at Concordia University.

The case emerged when a package containing a severed foot was found at the headquarters of Canada's Conservative Party last May.

That same day, a hand was discovered at a postal facility, in a package addressed to the Liberal Party of Canada.

Other body parts were reportedly sent to two schools in Vancouver. Lin's head was found in a Montreal park a month later, around the time of Magnotta’s arrest.
