Matt Dyer is recovering in a Montreal hospital after being mauled by a polar bear

A man from Turner, Maine is recovering in a Montreal hospital after being attacked by a polar bear while camping in a Newfoundland national park.

Matt Dyer was part of a seven-man group on a guided tour of Torngat National Park on the northern tip of Newfoundland when the attack happened.

The area is well known for polar bears and visitors sleeping in the park are equipped with an electric fence which is supposed to shock the animals if they touch it.

Dyer’s group was sleeping behind 
their protective fence when the single polar bear attacked them at about
 1:30am on Wednesday morning.

The bear dragged Dyer from his tent and was mauling him when his friends fired flares to scare the bear which dropped him and ran off.

It then took several hours for the group to could contact the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

A
 helicopter stationed at Saglek Fjord, about an hour flight away, was 
sent to the area and then took Dyer to a trauma clinic in Quebec.

He was later transferred to Montreal 
General Hospital, where he is recovering from bite wounds and broken 
bones. He condition is described as stable.

Torngat National Park is a 3,700-square-mile Canadian National Park in Newfoundland and is home to seal-hunting polar bears, caribou and remnant glaciers

Dyer's wife Jeanne Wells was informed of the attack on Wednesday afternoon and flew to Montreal.

‘The Canadians did an amazing job of getting him transported. There was a doctor in the group who took care of him right from the start,' she told the Bangor Daily News.

'He is in very stable condition. He will make a full recovery and that is a testament to his strength.'

Authorities are investigating how the attack happened and if there was an issue with the group's protective fence.

A spokesperson for the park said this is the first time an attack like this has happened since it opened in 2005.

'There are high densities of bears in the park and you are at very high risk of encountering a bear. That said, this is the only incident we have had of this seriousness since the park was established,' said Peter Deering, manager of resource conservation for Parks Canada in Western Newfoundland and Labrador.

Torngat National Park is a 3,700-square-mile Canadian National Park located on the Northern Labrador Mountains in Newfoundland and is home to seal-hunting polar bears, caribou and remnant glaciers.
