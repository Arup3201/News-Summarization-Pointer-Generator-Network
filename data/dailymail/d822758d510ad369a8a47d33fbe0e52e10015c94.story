One summer signing is flying, but Swansea City will perhaps be more focused on the one who was crying. What a loss Jefferson Montero will be to this side if the hamstring injury that wrecked his afternoon proves to be serious.

It was the rapid winger who made the only goal of the game for Gylfi Sigurdsson and the same little man who gave Jores Okore the kind of twisting, turning runaround that leads to a sleepless night.

Not bad for 22 minutes of work. But then his hamstring went and turned a game that was looking one-sided into something far more even.

He left the pitch in tears and with a salute from Sigurdsson, who represents the best of Garry Monk’s summer spending but is being pursued in that particular contest by the Ecuadorian with the fast feet.

On that score, Lukasz Fabianski is none too shabby either and his late saves meant Paul Lambert’s side suffered only their second league defeat in eight games. Lambert could barely believe it; Monk bristled at the subsequent suggestion his side got away with it.

‘I don’t feel fortunate at all,’ he said. ‘We were the better team.'

Perhaps his answer was coloured by thoughts of Montero.

‘It wasn’t good when he was holding his leg we will scan him and hopefully it is not serious,’ Monk said.

‘We will find out in the next 24 hours if it is serious, but I really hope not because he has been fantastic for us.’

How Lambert could use a bit of that creative spark. Here, it was the obvious omission from a side that had the best of the possession and a number of reasonable chances, but left with nothing tangible.

Lambert, the architect of numerous recent changes to this side’s style, drew the comparison to Swansea’s passing game, but it will not be lost on him that Villa struggled with a problem that has often in past seasons affected the team they were playing – how to turn passes into goals.

‘I am proud of them for the way they played,’ Lambert said.

‘We did to Swansea what they do to most teams here. We out-passed them.

‘We have changed the way we play and the lads are enjoying their football. Sometimes you lose and say we deserved nothing. But I go away from here disappointed to lose but delighted by the football.’

Words echoed by many Swansea managers in previous seasons, though not so much in this increasingly promising campaign.

So much of that is down to cutting edges like Montero and Sigurdsson.

On a soaked, slow pitch, Montero was somehow producing one of his finest performances of the season. The left winger was repeatedly picked out by team-mates with the sole intention of setting him free against Okore.

Villa hardly helped themselves by deploying Alan Hutton so far up the field as a wing-back and in the extra space Montero tormented Okore.

Within minutes of the start he had beaten him on the inside and out. For good measure, the 5ft 7in winger also beat Hutton to a cross and headed over, before winning the free-kick that Sigurdsson used to put Swansea ahead on 13 minutes.

Montero had collected the ball on the left and beaten Hutton and Fabian Delph before Okore brought him down outside the area. Sigurdsson’s free-kick for his third goal of the season was brilliant.

Sadly for Swansea, Montero’s game was soon up. He had just slalomed through a crowd of Aston Villa defenders and pulled back a cross for Wilfried Bony when his hamstring pinged.

That incident took hefty pressure off Villa and they improved. Christian Benteke went close with a free-kick and Aly Cissokho could not improvise enough to turn in a bouncing cross from Tom Cleverley.

Their cause was helped by Ashley Williams missing an easy header and Jonjo Shelvey having one of those days when his mind seemed elsewhere.

The 22-year-old’s talent is not in dispute, though for how long can that - and his age - be a robust defence against his inconsistency and errors of thought? The unnecessary decision to pull down Agbonlahor in the first half illustrated the point. He was booked and then substituted for Tom Carroll early in the second half.

Villa brought on Andreas Weimann at half-time and the extra attacking threat caused yet more pressure. Gabriel Agbonlahor had a reasonable shout for a penalty ignored and Weimann also scuffed a decent opening before a Fabianski save from Benteke at the death rescued Swansea.

Lambert suggested Villa deserved better and left as a defeated manager with a beaming smile; Monk pointed out that Ki Sung Yueng had an equally good chance to get a second for Swansea. He left as a victorious manager with a head full of concerns about a winger with a damaged hamstring.
