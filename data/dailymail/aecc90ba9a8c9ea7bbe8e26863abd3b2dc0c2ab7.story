 

It has a long and hallowed history within American political tradition, but is anyone better at having their photograph taken with children and babies than Barack Obama?

Indeed, a fresh batch of pictures taken over the summer and released by the White House this week leave no doubt that when it comes to that all important clinch with the kids, no one comes close to the current commander in chief.

Mainly taken in and around the White House, the photographs with the children reveal the president at arguably his most natural and comfortable, hardly surprising given the stresses and strains as the leader of the free world.

From a little boy who has face-planted himself into one of the Oval Office sofa's while his Secret Service agent father departs the president's security detail, to golfer Hunter Mahan's smiling daughter, Zoe, the joyous pictures lay bare Obama's softer side.

So sure is his touch in front of the camera with youngsters that it cuts a stark contrast with Sunday's claim from the president that the theater of the presidency does not come naturally to him.

But each of the children seem to be enamoured with the president and he equally seems to relish the time with them, away from the critical daily decision making at the White House.
