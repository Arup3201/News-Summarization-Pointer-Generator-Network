While a space shuttle requires more than 30,000 people to launch, the Delta Clipper Experimental Advanced, also known as the DCXA, only required 15 people to take off.

The pictures and video below show the amazing single-stage rocket launching thousands of feet without a pilot, moving through the air and landing back in its original position -- on its tail.

That was one of several successful launches, others of which saw the rocket reach as high as 10,000 feet, according to The Learning Channel video’s narrator.

The DCXA could lift off on its power without the need for separate throw-away boosters.

The unmanned reusable prototype was built by American aerospace manufacturer McDonnell Douglas in conjunction with the U.S. Defense Department’s Strategic Defense Initiative Organization from 1991 to 1993.

It was originally called the DC-X.

On August 18, 1993, a small group of spectators at the U.S. Army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico witnessed the rocket’s first launch, according to a report from the Ada Information Clearinghouse.

The original DC-X flew three times at the White Sands Missile Range before the Defense Department terminated the program in late 1993.

The rocket was then given to NASA scientists, who upgraded the vehicle’s design for improved performance and renamed the upgraded prototype the DCXA.

Reusable: The DCXA could be ready to fly again 24 hours after take-off

The prototype’s oxygen fuel tanks were 
built in Russia using lithium, the lightest of metals, while its 
hydrogen tanks were made of epoxy, the same material used in 
bullet-proof vests.

The DXCA would reportedly burn 90% of its take-off weight in its first three minutes of flight.

The redesigned rocket could be ready to fly again 24 hours after take-off.

The DCXA underwent its last test flight in 1996.

On July 2 that same year, NASA granted a contract for another single-stage reusable launch vehicle, known as the X-33, to Lockheed Martin for its VentureStar orbital spaceplane.

Remote control: Ground crew controlled the rocket by computer from a nearby trailer
