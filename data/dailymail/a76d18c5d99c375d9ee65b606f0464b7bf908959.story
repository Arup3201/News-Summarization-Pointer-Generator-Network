While many Grammy recipients enjoy the high life away from the recording studio, getting back to the day job is not so glamorous for one winner.

Kevin Mackie, of Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, won a Grammy for children’s album of the year at the awards in Los Angeles, California, this month.

But when the married 46-year-old is not attending glamorous ceremonies, you can find him working as a Shop Rite supermarket dairy manager.

Mr Mackie worked on All About Bullies, Big and Small with four other producers and all profits are being donated to an anti-bullying charity.

He told CBS Philly that he was ‘having an anxiety attack’ before the awards on February 13, but once it was announced ‘all that panic went away’.

‘The first minute we found out he won the Grammy, everybody was on Facebook, YouTube, texting him,’ Mr Mackie’s store manager Ali said.

His co-worker Rodney told CBS Philly that he texted ‘congratulations’ as soon as he heard Mr Mackie had won and soon got a call from the winner.

The group was also nominated at the Grammys last year for Healthy Food for Thought: Good Enough to Eat, but that was not victorious, reported Philly Burbs.

The latest album is a huge collaboration effort of 37 anti-bullying songs, poems and stories written by U.S. artists.

‘I have worked on some excellent CDs,’ Mr Pullara told Philly Burbs. ‘But this one here is the zenith. Not bragging, it just flows so well.’

The album features characters such as cyber bullies and children describing their lives through bicycles, according to its website.
