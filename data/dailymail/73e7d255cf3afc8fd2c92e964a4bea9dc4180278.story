Daniel Sturridge has revealed he will be fit to face Crystal Palace later this month. 

The Liverpool striker has been sidelined since September with a thigh injury suffered on England duty before sustaining a calf problem.

But speaking ahead of Liverpool’s Premier League clash against Chelsea, Sturridge said he hopes to be available for selection for his side's first match after the international break.

'I'll be ready for that one, God willing,' Sturridge told BT Sport. Regarding his spell on the sidelines he added: 'It's the worst feeling to be honest but that's football. Everyone picks injuries up.'

Sturridge has played only three times for Liverpool this term with his last outing in their 3-0 victory at Tottenham in August.

The 25-year-old was not included in England's squad for next week's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and Roy Hodgson said he did not speak to Brendan Rodgers about the striker's fitness. 

Sturridge has been out of action since sustaining a thigh injury while he was on international duty 

When asked if he had spoken to the Liverpool boss, Hodgson told Sky Sports News: 'No not at the moment but I have it in mind to do so of course.

'I was waiting to see what the situation would be with him (Sturridge). It's very good news to hear that he's travelled but of course before I select him again I would check with the player and the club that we were doing the right thing.'
