Peter Sutcliffe, who was jailed for murdering 13 women, was recently baptised in a pool in a private room at the high security hospital Broadmoor

The Yorkshire Ripper has enjoyed a specially-arranged baptism service in Broadmoor after becoming a Jehovah's witness.

Peter Sutcliffe, 68, who was jailed for murdering 13 women, was recently baptised in a pool in a private room at the high security hospital

The serial killer has been a practicing Jehovah's Witness for several years and holds bi-weekly bible study classes.

Earlier this month the Daily Mail reported on Sutcliffe's cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor, where he eats chocolate, watches television and listens to music.

Despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers he is allowed visitors four days a week - each of whom who can stay for up to four hours.

He is said to have money to spend in the psychiatric hospital’s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions. 

In 2010 MailOnline reported Sutcliffe had been befriended over the last 15 years by Jehovah’s Witnesses, who are emphatic that he now shows remorse for his crimes. 

The former trucker claimed he was on a divine mission to rid the streets of prostitutes. 

The Sun on Sunday has now reported that two fellow Jehovah's Witness brothers from a local Kingdom Hall carried out the baptism.

They quoted an unnamed source who claimed: 'Peter was really happy about being baptised and said afterwards he was now a Jehovah's Witness 'brother'.

'It is really odd that someone who did what he did is so religious now - they have even told him he will go to paradise because he has accepted God.'

The source added that people who know Sutcliffe think Broadmoor is 'doing too much' to let him practice the religion. 

Sutcliffe has already tried to convert fellow patients at the Berkshire psychiatric hospital.

He was jailed for life in 1981 after admitting killing 13 women and attempting to murder seven more between 1975 and 1981 in Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. 

Mr Justice Mitting likened Sutcliffe to a ‘terrorist’, saying the ‘brutality and gravity’ of his crimes meant he should never be released.

Sutcliffe has spent most of his life sentence in Broadmoor after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984.

He refused treatment until 1993, when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti-psychotic medication forcibly. 

He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left.

It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell.

Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected.

In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released.

His health has deteriorated in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and later suffered from a debilitating cough. Medication has made him put on weight and has increased his blood pressure. 

Sutcliffe used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England.
