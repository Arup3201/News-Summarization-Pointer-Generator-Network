Shortly after the match Cole had tweeted: 'Strange feeling playing back in England and against Lamps!! Always tough to play City but great to get an away point.' 

Lampard is currently on loan at Manchester City having joined New York City FC  while Cole signed a two-year deal with Roma in July after both players were allowed to leave Chelsea at the end of last season.

The former Chelsea left back became the 11th Englishman to play for a foreign club in the Champions League after starting at the Etihad.

Cole and Lampard earned legendary status during their time at Chelsea after helping the Blues win the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup.

Lampard spent 13 years in west London having arrived from West Ham in 2001 while Cole represented the club for eight seasons after joining from Arsenal in 2006.

They were also part of England's 'Golden Generation', which reached the quarter-finals of the 2006 World Cup but was expected to do so much more.
