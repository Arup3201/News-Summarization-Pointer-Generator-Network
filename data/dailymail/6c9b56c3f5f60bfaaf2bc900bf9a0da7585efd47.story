The top ten U.S. search terms included four variations on Facebook - Facebook.com, Facebook, Facebook login and www.facebook.com - the second year the social networking giant has had four top ten slots.

Overall, searches for Facebook accounted for 4.42 per cent of searches - a 24 per cent increase in a year, according to web-monitoring firm Experian Hitwise.

Other web giants such as YouTube made up the rest of the top ten. Most people prefer to search rather than type in an address, said Hitwise.

In the UK, 'Daily
 Mail' is 14th from the top in search terms - and the Daily Mail charts far higher than 
all other British newspapers.

Facebook - and variants on the term made up four out of the top ten slots in the most searched-for terms of 2011, revealed data released by web monitoring firm Experian Hitwise

The habit of typing in favourite websites, rather than entering them in the address bar, is partly driven by 'predictive search', where Google or other search engines 'fill in' search terms as you type. It's just easier to search rather than type in a web address that might not work.

Most of us simply can't be bothered to move the cursor up the screen to type in a fiddly address when Google or other search engines will fill it in for us.

It's also much easier on mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, where typing and navigating can be difficult.

In the UK in particular, people are keen on brevity - unlike the US, the abbreviation 'FB' - no prizes for guessing what it's short for' - made the top ten for the first time this year.

New terms that entered the top 50 U.S. search terms for 2011 included amazon.com, hotmail, and twitter.

Analysis of the search terms revealed that social networking-related terms dominated the U.S. results, accounting for 4.18 percent of the top 50 searches.

'Navigational searches dominated the top search results as users typed in terms versus typing in the URL in the browser bar,' said Simon Bradstock, general manager of Experian Hitwise. 'It's a result of predictive search functions across major search engines.'

Celebrities don't even begin to enter the U.S. chart - compiled across all search engines - till 92nd place, where Justin Bieber scored the top slot.

The results are hugely different from charts such as Google's Zeitgeist, because Google structures their reports to cut out searches for websites.
