Malaysia's acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein has said underwater search for missing flight MH370 may have to be revised in 48 hours, revealing dwindling optimism of finding Boeing 777

The next 48 hours in the search for missing flight MH370 will be crucial, Malaysia's Defence Minister said today - a warning that new plans would then have to be made.

Mr Hishammuddin Hussein, who is also the country's Acting Transport Minister, said it was his understanding 'that the search effort is entering a critical stage in the next 48 hours.

'Whatever happens in that period, we will then regroup and discuss our next move.'

Mr Hisammuddin was speaking in Kuala Lumpur as the underwater drone Bluefin-21 was sent on its seventh mission 1500 miles north west of Perth, Western Australia, to search for any sign of the wreckage of the Boeing 777 aircraft.

The Minister's reference to just 48 hours revealed less optimism than comments by Australia's Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, who had forecast that the search would continue at least until the end of next week.

In addition, officials co-ordinating the search also said today that the underwater search would continue for another five to seven days.

Despite the differences in the comments by Mr Hishamuddin and those of Australian officials, it became clear today that hopes of finding the wreckage of the aircraft at the bottom of the Indian Ocean were now fading fast.

The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre which is overseeing the search from Perth said in a statement today that after almost two months without a sign of wreckage the current underwater search has been narrowed to a circular area with a radius of 6.2 miles.

The area is located where one of four pings believed to have come from the plane's black box recorders was detected on April 8.

'Provided the weather is favourable for 
launch and recovery of the AUV (austomonmous underwater vessel) and we 
have a good run with the serviceability of the AUV, we should complete 
the search of the focused underwater area in five to seven days,' 
officials told Reuters in an email.Â 

Underwater drone Bluefin-21 sent on seventh mission into water 1,500 miles north of Perth to look for missing jet. The search area has been limited to just 6.2 nautical miles but hopes of finding the craft are fading

Australian PM Tony Abbott previously said the search could continue until next week, but new comments today show less optimism for operation which has now been going on for two months

But there was no indication whether searchers were confident that the search area would produce any clues about the flight - and there was no suggestion what they might try if nothing is found in coming days.

Meanwhile Mr Hishummuddin, pointing out that the search operation had entered day 43, said today that searchers had 'pursued every possible lead presented to us at this stage and with every passing day, the search has become more difficult.'

He revealed for the first time that Bluefin-21 had captured clear and sharp images of the seabed, but nothing of interest had been found.

And while he stressed that operations would not stop, consideration would have to be given soon to 'other approaches' which might include widening the scope of the search and utilising other assets that could be relevant in the operation.

'The search will always continue,' he said. 'It is just a matter of approach.'
