Preparing for a new exhibition can be stressful at the best of times but these staff members have their work cut out for them - hanging a priceless 16th Century tapestry.

Staff are pictured carefully suspending an eight by four metre tapestry entitled Peace and Mercy Win the Promise of Redemption, made in 1517, from a wall in Buckingham Palace.

The rare piece is part of The Northern Renaissance: Dürer to Holbein exhibition in The Queen's Gallery that brings together over 100 works by the greatest northern European artists of the period.

The exhibition celebrates the art of the Northern Renaissance, bringing together 120 paintings, drawings, prints and manuscripts and miniatures by the greatest Northern European artists of the 15th and 16th centuries. 

Among the highlights are prints and drawings by Albrecht Dürer, mythological paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder, and preparatory drawings by Hans Holbein the Younger displayed alongside the finished oil portraits.

The 15th and 16th centuries were a time of dramatic change in northern Europe.

Monarchs vied for territorial power, religious reformers questioned the central tenets of the church and scholars sought greater understanding of their world.

Against this backdrop, artists produced works of extraordinarily diverse subject matter and superb technical skill.

The exhibition runs from November 2nd to April 14 at The Queen's Gallery in Buckingham Palace.
