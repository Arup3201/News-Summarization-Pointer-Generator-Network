Thierry Henry has vowed to draw on the experience of working under Arsene Wenger and Pep Guardiola to ensure his coaching career will be a rip-roaring success.

The French legend, 37, has quit the New York Red Bulls after four-and-a-half years in the MLS and although he is yet to officially hang up his boots, a role on the sidelines beckons.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger would love to have the striker he made into one of the best in the world as part of his coaching team at the Emirates.

France: 1998 World Cup, Euro 2000, Confederations Cup 2003

And Henry, who will take some time out before making his next move, would love the chance to pass on his vast knowledge and experience to the next crop of stars.

Playing for managers like Wenger and Guardiola has geared him up for the next phase of his career.

'Everyone that you work with throughout you career, whether it be the right thing or the wrong thing, you learn,' said an emotional Henry.

'If you are not stupid with it, open your eyes and take from it what you need and what you don't then you will make your own recipe for success.

'You are always learning and I always learn more in the difficult moments – that is when you find out about yourself.'

Henry plans to keep his Manhattan apartment and will take a few weeks out to consider his next move.

He added: 'It is all a bit blurry right now. We will see what will happen soon. Going back to Arsenal? That is the wish. They say Christmas is coming soon, it is a wish but it is not something which will happen straight away.

'Everyone knows how much I love the club, my feelings about them. It is a wish right now, I only announced I was leaving New York on Monday so I am not trying to get out of it but it has only been a day.

'In the tough moments you learn a lot. You can see from my performances this season that I am still able to play.

'There is nothing better than trying to help a team-mate mentally and make them a better player and it those moments which I will cherish. That is the mentality that I had when I came here - to try and make people better.'

Henry has been seen as a real success story in the MLS - scoring 51 goals in 122 matches following his move from Barcelona in 2010.

He was, though, unable to make it a fairy-tale ending as the Red Bulls' hopes of being crowned MLS champions were crushed by New England last weekend who will meet Robbie Keane's LA Galaxy in Sunday's final.

With French newspaper L'Equipe launching a campaign to get national manager Didier Deschamps to hand the 37 year-old a final farewell for Les Blues against Brazil in March, it promises to be a very long, drawn out goodbye.

Henry has steadfastly refused to talk about his future despite making it clear he would not be signing a new deal to replace the one which ran out at the end of the MLS season.

But he admitted: 'I didn't want to be the focus to be on me. I had a blast. It was tough personally for me but I embraced the MLS and New York. It's not easy, if players come here at a late stage in their career and they are not ready to perform, it is not like that.

'The decision was pretty easy for me. People were asking me about retirement and I don't know about that yet but I knew it was time to leave New York.

'It is emotional. I can't scream at these guys anymore – I am sure they won't miss that. When get upset it is for the good of the team. I always try my best.

'I will miss being in the dressing room. People see my competitive side but I like to joke too. I will keep my place here, watch some games, provided they will let me come back!'

I am taking this opportunity to announce that unfortunately Saturday was my last game for the New York Red Bulls. 

The decision has always been that I would leave after the duration of my contract and although that was never going to change, I didn't want it to distract from the progress of the team.

I have immensely enjoyed my four-and-a-half years here and would like to thank everyone involved with this club who has made my time here so enjoyable.

Thanks must go particularly to Erik Soler, Hans Backe, Gerard Houllier, Andy Roxburgh, Mike Petke, all my team-mates, the technical staff, medical staff, all the personnel who work for the Red Bull organisation, the MLS and of course the owner Mr Mateschitz whose vision and passion brought me to this wonderful city.

A special mention must go to the Red Bull fans who have supported this team through the good, the bad and the ugly times in the sun, rain and snow. 

You guys have really meant a lot to me and thank you for all your wonderful support.

I will now take the next few weeks to reflect and decide on the next chapter of my career.

Thank you all

Thierry Henry
