The U.S. is hopeful that years of standoffs over Iran's nuclear programme are coming to an end after UN talks yesterday.

Secretary of State John Kerry met one-on-one with the Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at the end of the summit, shaking his hand and sitting beside him in the highest-level contact between the two nations for six years.

However officials want the Islamic nation to draw up a detailed plan of action to reassure the world it is not secretly trying to develop an atom bomb.

After the UN summit Kerry leaned over and asked the Iranian foreign minister to talk one-on-one in the highest-level contact between the nations in six years

Kerry said: 'Needless to say, one meeting and a change in tone, that was welcome, does not answer those questions.

'All of us were pleased that the foreign minister came today and that he did put some possibilities on the table.'

Fresh talks will now be held on October 15-16 after the UN council's five permanent members, plus Germany, agree to fast-track negotiations.

Iran is keen to win a reprieve to tough sanctions which have slashed oil exports by more than half, restricted its international bank transfers, devalued its currency and sent inflation surging.

Zarif said the end result would have to include 'a total lifting' of the international sanctions, adding: 'We hope ... to make sure (there is) no concern that Iran's program is anything but peaceful.'

'Now we have to see whether we can match our positive words with serious deeds so we can move forward.'

The upbeat tone comes a day after Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, called on 
Israel to join an international treaty banning the spread of nuclear 
weapons, chiding the Jewish state for being the only Middle East nation 
that has failed to do so.

Rouhani faces a backlash in his country after seeming to concede that the holocaust happened in a TV interview, after eight years of denials from former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad

'Almost
four decades of international efforts to establish a nuclear 
weapon-free zone in the Middle East have regrettably failed,' Mr Rouhani
told a United Nations meeting on nuclear disarmament on the sidelines 
of the General Assembly.

Israel is the only Middle East nation that has not signed the landmark 1979 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and Mr Rouhani said that has prevented the region from establishing a nuclear-free zone.

It has never commented on suggestions it possesses a nuclear arsenal.

Mr Rouhani also said all nations should be subject to International Atomic Energy Agency inspections and other nuclear safeguards.

Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only, and says it needs to enrich uranium to produce reactor fuel and for medical purposes.

But world powers fear Iran is trying enriching uranium to higher levels which would enable it build warheads.

Amir Hekmati, a joint U.S. Iranian citizen, has been in prison in Iran since 2011 after being convicted of spying

Earlier in the week Mr Rouhani said a deal over Iran's nuclear weapons should be struck with the US within three months.

Mr Rouhani told the Washington Post: 'The only way forward is for a timeline to be inserted into the negotiations that's short–and wrap it up.

'That is a decision of my government, that short is necessary to settle the nuclear file.

'The shorter it is the more beneficial it is to everyone. If it's three months that would be Iran's choice, if it's six months that's still good. It's a question of months not years.'

The apparent thawing of relations between America and Iran in recent weeks has seen Rouhani apparently admit that the holocaust happened in an interview broadcast on CNN.

Rouhani's predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spent years denying the holocaust as part of his rhetoric against the Jewish state of Israel, one of America's strongest Middle Eastern allies.

While the new President would not be drawn on the scale or numbers invovled, he is now facing a backlash at home after a conservative news agency accused CNN of wrongly translating the remark.

The improvement in relations between Iran and the West has also prompted the father of an imprisoned former U.S. Marine to beg for his son's release.

Ali Hekmati is asking Rouhani to order the release of his son, Amir, as Ali is now suffering with a brain tumour and may not have long to live.

In a letter, the ailing father says: 'I long more than ever to see Amir's face. I am now very sick.

'I ask that you let me see him again, one more time, and so that he may lead our family when I am gone.

'Amir is a good man. An honorable man. He is not a spy, I can assure you of that.'

Amir Hekmati, who has dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, was arrested in Iran in 2011. The family claim he was visiting his grandmother but the Islamic state accused him of being a CIA spy and convicted him.

A short while later a video was released showing Amir 'confessing' to his crimes.

Amir's father has reason to be hopeful after Iran freed dozens of political prisoners last week, just as Rouhani was headed to New York for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.

Earlier this month, Amir wrote a letter to US Secretary of Sate John Kerry describing his 'miserable prison conditions' and his belief that Tehran wanted to use him in a possible prisoner exchange.

Hekmati's letter was smuggled out of prison and his sister authenticated the handwriting.

The State Department said it was trying to determine Hekmati's condition through Swiss diplomats in Tehran.

The Swiss represent U.S. interests in Iran because no U.S. officials are based there. The two countries severed diplomatic relations in 1979.

Two other American citizens are believed to be detained in Iran: Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini.

The release of prisoners and the softening on nuclear talks are part of a fresh charm offensive by Iran following years of icy relations under the former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

As a condition of any deal Iran has said it will agree to international inspections along the lines of those between 2003 and 2005 and has not ruled out a meeting with Barack Obama.

Rouhani added: 'If Mr Obama and I were to get together, we would both be looking at the 
future, and the prospects ahead and our hopes for that future.

'The notes and 
letters and exchanges between us are in that direction, and they will 
continue. We need a beginning point. I think that is the nuclear issue.'
