When U.S. House of
Representatives Speaker John Boehner, a  Republican, jolted
Washington this week by inviting Israeli prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to address Congress, his office said it had been done
'on behalf of the bipartisan leadership.'

In reality, it was among the most partisan moves so far by
America's newly Republican-controlled Congress.

Officials told Israeli newspaper Haaretz the Israeli leader had 'spat' in President Barack Obama's face. 

'We thought we've seen everything,' the newspaper quoted an unnamed senior US official as saying. 'But Bibi managed to surprise even us.

Furious: The White House is said to be outraged over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to speak before Congress in March — a move he failed to coordinate with the administration

'There are things you simply don't do. He spat in our face publicly and that's no way to behave. Netanyahu ought to remember that President Obama has a year and a half left to his presidency, and that there will be a price,' he said. 

Fuming
Democratic leaders in Congress have said they were not
consulted, raising questions over whether Boehner had accurately
characterized the nature of his invitation.

The invitation was worded that way, a Boehner spokesman said
on Friday, because 'Boehner is the Speaker of the whole House,
elected by the whole House.' Boehner was re-elected as the
chamber's leader on Jan. 6 with 216 votes, all from Republicans,
out of the 435 voting members of the House of Representatives.

Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, and Nancy
Pelosi, his counterpart in the House, said they had not been
told in advance of Boehner's plan to invite Netanyahu. 

Unwavering: In his address the Israeli leader is expected to speak about stalled US-led nuclear negotiations with Iran, and to urge lawmakers to slap Tehran with a new round of tougher sanctions

The White
House also said that President Barack Obama, a Democrat, had not
been told ahead of time and were said to be 'completely blindsided'.

'The Speaker of the House has awesome power. I know that.
I've been there,' Pelosi told her weekly news conference on
Thursday. 'The fact, though, is that power is not to be
squandered.'

In announcing the invitation on Wednesday, Boehner called 
Netanyahu 'a great friend of our country.'

'In this time of challenge, I am asking the Prime Minister
to address Congress on the grave threats radical Islam and Iran
pose to our security and way of life,' he said.

Democratic congressional staffers called Boehner's action a
blatant political ploy. 

Netanyahu is expected to back Republican moves to pressure
Obama to take a tougher line in talks on a nuclear deal with
Iran.

The prime minister is due to address Congress two weeks
before Israel's general election on March 17 in which he is
vying for a fourth term.

Obama and other world leaders negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program have firmly argued against a sanctions bill from Congress, which they say would unravel a delicate international coalition and tank negotiations.

'We asked the Israelis in private and public to sit tight and the President made clear if a deal wasn't reached he would be the first in line advocating for more sanctions,' the official said.

That's what makes Netanyahu's decision to address Congress a 'pretty big deal,' the official added.

The flap added to a growing perception that Netanyahu's
government has become a partisan Republican player in U.S.
politics, despite historically close ties to lawmakers in both
parties.

Republicans were unapologetic.

Own agenda? House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu to speak to Congress without consulting the Obama administration

Netanyahu's continued expansion of Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem has angered U.S. officials, prompting one senior White House official to call Netanyhau a 'chicken****' 

Arizona Republican John McCain said the party was giving
Obama a taste of his own medicine. 

In a hallway interview at the
Capitol, he termed the invitation 'a great idea' after Obama's
announcement that he would push ahead on policy without waiting
to compromise with Congress.

'He basically said, 'I'm going to do my thing, you do your
thing.' We got it, we got the message,' McCain said. 

The White House announced that Obama won't meet with Netanyahu during his visit because of the proximity to Israeli elections.

The visit could play well for Netanyahu at home as he presents himself as the best protector of Israel's security.

'The last thing we want to do is hurt Israel, but if he is able to stiff the U.S. President like that and we still offer him a meeting -- that invites him and anyone else to do that over and over,' a senior administration official told CNN.
