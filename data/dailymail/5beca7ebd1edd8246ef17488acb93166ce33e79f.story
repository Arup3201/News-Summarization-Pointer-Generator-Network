Russia prepared its astronauts for every eventuality - so much so that its survival kits for space included fishing equipment.

The kits also had handguns to ‘scare off wolves, bears and tigers’ and to fight off ‘hostile foreign nationals’ in the event of a crash landing.

The NAZ-3 survival kit was designed in 1968 for the Soviet Soyuz spacecraft, which is still in use today.

A report by The Appendix blog reveals the contents of a Soviet cosmonaut survival kit which includes matches, a radio, gloves, a compass and a medical kit.

Back in 1960s, cosmonauts reported rough 
landings and apparently needed these kits to fend of attacks in 
unfamiliar environments.

Later Soviet survival kits expanded to include fishing tackle, improved cold suits and fur-lined boots.

The kit included the Soviet TP-82, a special combination gun with a detachable machete created for use in hunting, firing distress beacons, and defencegun used in cosmonaut's survival kit

The kit included the Soviet TP-82, a special combination gun with a detachable machete created for  hunting, firing distress beacons and self-defence.

American astronauts who trained as part of the Soyuz spacecraft crews for the International Space Station in the 90s also had to learn how to use the firearm.

Appendix recalls how astronaut Jim Voss learned to use the gun in a mock-up spacecraft in the Black Sea using wine, beer and vodka bottles as target practice.

Russian cosmonauts still carry 
semiautomatic firearms in space.

At any one time, there are usually 
one or two handguns on board the International Space Station.

Much of the equipment in these kits is now up for auction. The machete attachment, for instance, is being sold for $240 (£150).
