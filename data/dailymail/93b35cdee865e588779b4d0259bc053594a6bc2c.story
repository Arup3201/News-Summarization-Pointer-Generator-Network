Ronny Deila's first taste of European football ought to serve as a blow to the solar plexus of anyone who doubts his capacity to make the quantum leap from tiny Stromgodset to Celtic Park.

The autumn of 2011 paired the Norwegian minnows with no less a side than Atletico Madrid in the third qualifying round of the Europa League. For those observers unaware of the near miracle he was overseeing in the small city of Drammen, the tie had the whiff of a turkey shoot about it.

A squad boasting the likes of Ramadel Falcao and Diego Forlan would surely get the job done with something to spare. So went the theory anyway.

The Spaniards got there in the end. A 2-1 win the first step, it transpired, on a road that would see them lift the trophy the following spring.

Stromgodset succumbed in the end by the same score on home soil a week later but both they and their young manager had more than made their mark.

So much for the Vincente Calderon eating them up and spitting them out. Deila’s men played on the front foot from the off in Spain, leaving the Primera Liga giants wondering exactly what had his them.

For their young manager, it was a night when an appetite for such jousts became insatiable.

‘That was my biggest moment in football ever,’ Deila recalled on Monday.

‘We played a fantastic game. I have played in Cup Finals, but for me that international stage against a good team when we played well gave me a very good feeling.

‘It was 59 per cent to 41 per cent (possession for Atletico). It was possible because we did it. We played well and had a big chance to make it 2-2. At home we had them under pressure – but the difference is how effective you are.

‘They had Diego Forlan in their side and although he didn’t want to play after the South American Championships, they needed him because they did not want to miss out.

‘You see the skills they have when taking chances – that’s the difference between teams at that level.

‘I hope that I will get many feelings like that at Celtic – that’s why I came here.

‘I looked at the Barcelona game and, although Celtic didn’t win, the atmosphere was unbelievable. That’s why you are in football.

‘You want to win trophies, but the moments at matches when you experience good things with fans and players is also special.’

Deila’s raison d’etre is currently to give himself and his new club as much chance of tasting such occasions this season as is humanly possible.

Commendably, the Norwegian didn’t try to paint KR Reykjavic as something they weren’t yesterday.Celtic’s inaugural opponents in this year’s quest for the group stage will be more than competent.

Deila would expect nothing less from a side sitting fourth in their league after nine matches.

The reigning Icelandic champions will be match fit, too, and given their country’s progression to the World Cup play-offs last year, unlikely to be gripped by an inferiority complex, either.

Nonetheless, while not a gentle trip to the Welsh valleys, it’s hardly a tie to have the Scottish champions hiding under the bed.

‘That’s true – Celtic is expected to win,’ Deila added.

‘Icelandic football has improved a lot in the last few years. It is unbelievable what Iceland has achieved in football – and handball, as well.

‘That’s the two sports they are good at. Almost everyone gets involved at an early age.

‘I think in many ways Icelandic football is ahead of many other countries.

‘But I think their league is much lower quality than the national team because so many players go abroad.

The most successful club in Icelandic football. They won the last of their 13 titles last year. They’ve been managed by former Iceland international Runar Kristinsson since 2010.

WHERE DO THEY PLAY?

The KR-vollur. With a capacity of 2,781, it’s not one of Europe’s more intimidating arenas. It also boasts a grass park, which is one less thing for Celtic to worry about.

WHAT CAN CELTIC EXPECT?

An uncompromising and athletic outfit. Given that Icelandic football adheres to a summer season, they’ll also be match fit. After nine games, they sit fourth in the table — three points off the pace.

ANYONE WE WOULD KNOW?

Kjartan Finnbogason was on Celtic’s books between 2005 and 2008, although he didn’t play a game. Former Middlesbrough man Gary Martin plays up front for them.

WHAT’S THEIR RECENT EUROPEAN HISTORY?

This will be their sixth successive campaign. Last year, in the Europa League they saw off Northern Ireland’s Glentoran 3-0, before losing 6-2 on aggregate to Standard Liege.

A DECENT DRAW THEN?

Could be better, could be worse. The dream trip to Wales or Northern Ireland to face TNS or Cliftonville didn’t materialise. but neither did the horrific prospect of facing Malmo.

‘They are hard-working players with a good team spirit. They will be well organised, too. But we are Celtic. We should be a better team than them over two matches. Now it’s all about doing everything right in pre-season to get the squad as best physically and mentally prepared for these games.

‘We will try to do everything right in Austria to build up the physical shape of the players as quickly as possible and in the best way, without getting injuries. Then we will be very focused on this game.’

Celtic fly to Austria for a two-week training camp this Sunday but, if his schedule allows, Deila intends to watch the Icelandic side in action.

While familiarising himself with the KR players is top of his agenda, their coach Runar Kristinsson needs no introduction from his time playing in Norway. 

‘I played against him many times, he was a very good player,’ Deila added. ‘I don’t remember much about the games against him but he was a good player. He was a central midfielder and went on to Belgium afterwards. I know he was a big star with Lillestrom.’

Deila has spent the past week growing accustomed to his new surroundings but the relative peace he’s enjoyed will this morning be shattered by the return of the bulk of his squad for pre-season training.

He intends it to be a convivial and informative affair.

‘It’s important to get settled and tell players how things are going to be,’ he said. ‘That’s what we will do first and then we can start working.

‘Then the exercises will not be high intensity because we have been away a long time. We will get to know each other and take it from there.

‘I don’t think we will change much – but some things will be different. Maybe we will meet up a little bit earlier so we can plan things before training.

Settling in: Deila has been getting used to his new surroundings in Glasgow since being named Celtic boss

‘We will talk about what the training will consist of so we all have an idea of what we will focus on on the pitch.

‘Everything is about training. You train as you play. If you have good preparations then the players will develop. The staff will work hard to make it as short and simple as possible so players can use energy on the pitch.

‘The players have to feel that I can trust them and they must also have fun. If they do that then things will happen – I know it.’
