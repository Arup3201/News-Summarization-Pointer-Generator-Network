A waitress has claimed that she contracted herpes from a MAC lipstick endorsed by Rihanna at one of the singer's concerts.

Starkeema Greenidge, 28, developed mouth sores after a MAC Cosmetics representative applied the 'RiRi Woo' lipstick on her as she attended a show in Brooklyn, New York, she claims in a lawsuit.

She is now suing MAC, which launched Rihanna's lipstick in May, after she suffered emotional distress from the ordeal. She was unable to work for two weeks, causing a loss of earnings, she says.

Greenidge was
 at the Rihanna concert at the Barclay's Center on May 7 when she stopped at a MAC 
Cosmetics pop-up counter, according to the lawsuit, the New York Daily News reported.

A representative used a tube of the 
lipstick on her, and when Greenidge asked if it was clean, the woman 
replied, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah', Greenidge claims.

The employee applied the RiRi Woo red lipstick to her upper lip and instructed her to 'press her lips together and spread the lipstick around', according to the suit.

The representative 'didnâ€™t use a fresh or new lipstick tube, but rather one that had been used for other patrons,' the suit alleges.

Two days later, Greenidge developed a cold sore on her lip and her doctor diagnosed it as herpes. It caused her mental anguish and emotional distress, she says in her lawsuit.

'I wasn't able to work for two weeks,' Greenidge told the Daily News. 'It cost me a lot of money.'

She is now suing MAC - not Rihanna - for
 an unspecified amount and said she brought the case because she wants 
the company to be more hygienic in the future.

Her lawsuit said the company 'should have known... it was unsanitary and exposing patrons to possible spread of disease'.

She added that staff should be trained to use disposable tubes or swabs to apply the lipstick.

'This is going to happen over and over again if nothing is done,' Greenidge said.

Rihanna signed a deal with MAC Cosmetics in February for her own line, including the RiRi Woo lipstick, which sold out within minutes of being released on May 2.

MAC officials did not respond to a request for comment.
