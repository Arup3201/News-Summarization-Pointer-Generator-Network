'A great team with young players': Balotelli, who left Manchester City in 2013, said Liverpool are one of the best teams in England

Balotelli told the Liverpool club website: 'I'm very happy. We've been talking about coming here and now I'm happy to be here. Liverpool are one of the best teams here in England and the football is very good here.

'It's a great team with young players, and that's why I came here.'

He has won the Premier League with Manchester City in 2012, the Champions League with Inter Milan in 2010, three Serie A championships and the FA Cup, plus 33 caps for Italy during which he has scored 13 goals including the strike that accounted for England in the World Cup. He has also had a colourful career and has often fallen out with his managers.

Balotelli, who has the option of a fourth year when his new contract runs out in 2017, also admitted he was surprised by the reaction he got from Liverpool fans upon his arrival. 

He added: 'I didn't expect [the incredible reception from fans] because I've always been playing against Liverpool. Whenever I played against Liverpool, the fans weren't nice with me but that's normal - it's football!

Controversial past: Balotelli has had some issues with his behaviour but Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is confident he can get the best out of him

'Now that I play for Liverpool, I can see the expectation in people. They're very happy and that makes me very happy at the same time.

'When I play with this team [at Anfield], it's going to be nice for sure. To play here for Liverpool excites me, but if you're an opponent it's difficult.

'I maybe have a little bit more experience than other players - if I can help them, I'm happy to help them.

'When I meet the team, start training with them and start my first game, I will realise. For now, I have just seen the city.' 

Having moved to AC Milan in January 2013, Balotelli now admits it was a mistake to leave the Premier League.

He said: 'I'm happy to be back because I left England and it was a mistake. I wanted to go to Italy but I realised it was a mistake.

'English football is generally better. English football is beautiful.'

Balotelli should be in the Liverpool dressing room ahead of the clash with former club Manchester City on Monday night, as well as on the team coach after the game at the Etihad Stadium.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers also told the club website: 'This transfer represents outstanding value for the club and I think we have done a really smart piece of business here.

'There is no doubting Mario's ability; he is a world-class talent and someone who, for such a young age, has vast experience of playing at the very highest level.

'He has scored goals in the Barclays Premier League, in Italy, in the Champions League and for his country at international level.'
