A Utah man  was hospitalized for chugging a quart of eggnog so quickly that he inhaled some of creamy holiday beverage into his lungs.

Ryan Roche from Utah County participated in an alcohol-free eggnog chugging contest at a holiday office party earlier this month.

He downed a quart of eggnog in 12 seconds without taking a breath but soon began coughing and gasping.

'Everyone knows I'm pretty competitive,' Roche told ABC News.

'I just decided I was going to win. So I pretty much just opened it up and poured it down my throat.' 

Hours later, a friend drove him to the hospital as Roche was shaking and struggling to breathe.

'I was laying on the couch, shaking uncontrollably, nauseous, having fevers and panting,' Roche, a salesman, told ABC News.

Doctors told him he had eggnog in his lungs. He was put on oxygen and antibiotics and released from the hospital after three days.

'It was not fun,' Roche told ABC News. 'It took me a full week of recovery to be 100 percent.'

Roche recovered his strength after a week.

Now that it's safe to joke, his co-workers can't stop taunting him.

'People are emailing me pictures of eggnog — it never gets old,' he told ABC News. 'I'm pretty competitive but, unfortunately, in this situation it got the best of me.

'But it's become quite the story.'
