TOTTENHAM 

Hugo Lloris: Doesn’t deserve to be playing behind this defence. Should have done better on Bojan goal. 5

Kyle Naughton: Sent off when team had a token chance of getting back into the game. 3.

Kyle Naughton (right) caps a miserable afternoon by getting sent off in the final 10 minutes of the match

Younes Kaboul: Lost his cool, looked like he wanted to be sent off. 4

Federico Fazio: Terrified of the ball, you would think it is on fire. 4.5

Danny Rose: Left the field with an oxygen mask a few minutes after final whistle. Poor defensively. 4

Etienne Capoue: Non-existent. Time for a spell out of the team. 4.

Ryan Mason: Fans’ favourite, willing worker, but well short of snaffling Sidwell in the centre. 5.

Andros Townsend: In the England squad. Won’t be going there with any confidence. Hooked at half-time. 3.5

Nacer Chadli: Nice finish gets him out of jail, but otherwise made no impression. 6 

Christian Eriksen: What happened to the guy who destroyed Manchester City in the Champions League for Ajax? Bring him back. Hooked at half-time. 2

Christian Eriksen (right) did not look interested and was taken off at half-time by Mauricio Pochettino

Harry Kane: Shawcross kept him quiet. Worked hard, never had a sniff. No repeat of Villa heroics with 89th-minute free-kick. 4.

SUBS: Erik Lamela (Townsend 46): Couple of nice touches. 5

Mousa Dembele (Eriksen 46): Barely made a difference. 4

Emmanuel Adebayor (Capoue 64): Delayed sub because he decided to change boots at last minute. Says it all. 5

Unused: Vertonghen, Vorm, Soldado, Dier. 

Manager - Mauricio Pochettino: Time to get to work, Mauricio. 3.

STOKE 

Asmir Begovic: Flying save from Lamela stab. Solid. 7

Phil Bardsley: Injured after just six minutes. 6 

Marc Wilson: Injured after just 26 minutes. Unlucky for him 6.

Ryan Shawcross: ‘Shawcross for England’ sing Stoke fans. Not far off now. 7

Erik Pieters: Nice job down the left, rarely troubled 7.

Steven Nzonzi: Neat and tidy alongside Sidwell. Looked up for the challenge in the centre. 7.

Steve Sidwell: Thrived in the atmosphere and bossed the middle of midfield. Impressive stuff. 7.5

Jon Walters: Read the pass for his goal, easiest finish of his career. 7.5

Bojan Krkic: Was given the run of the place. Absolutely loves it when the ball is at his feet. 7.5

Victor Moses: Dragged back by Naughton for sending off. Played well. 7

Mame Biram Diouf: Hard-working performance, possibly deserved a goal. 7.

SUBS: Geoff Cameron (Bardsley 9): Settled in straight away, booked though. 6

Marc Muniesa (Wilson 26): Another one who looked comfortable. Rarely troubled. 6.5

Stephen Ireland (Bojan 83): Came on to help see the game out. He needn’t have worried. 6

Unused: Arnautovivc, Sorensen, Crouch, Adam.

Manager - Mark Hughes: Did Spurs up like a kipper. 7.5

Referee: Mike Jones. Outstanding, every decision spot on. 9.

Referee Mike Jones, here sending off Naughton, was excellent and got every decision spot on
