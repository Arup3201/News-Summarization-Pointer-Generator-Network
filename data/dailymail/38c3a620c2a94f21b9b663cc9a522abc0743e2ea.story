Jose Mourinho believes that next season's Premier League title race will be even more open - and admits his Chelsea side could finish anywhere from being champions to finishing sixth.

And having already signed Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona - with Spain striker Diego Costa expected to be next to head to Stamford Bridge - Mourinho has admitted he still needs to 'rebuild' Chelsea, hinting that more changes could be on the way.

Speaking to Chelsea's website, the Portuguese coach reflected on his first season back in London that saw Chelsea finish third behind Manchester City and Liverpool - and said that Chelsea will be 'better' next season, before admitting that their title rivals may also improve.

Close season: Mourinho has been talking through his expectations for next season's title race

Mourinho repeatedly stated throughout last season's campaign that Chelsea - his 'little horse' had no chance of winning the Premier League.

But he says that in the 2014/15 campaign, the Blues want to finish top of the pile.

'Next season will be very, very difficult, even more so,' he said.Â

'I know Chelsea will be better, but maybe the other teams will be better too, so it will again be the kind of league where you don't know if you're going to finish first or finish sixth. In this moment I have to think and feel and say we want to finish first.

'I enjoy this club, I like the club, and I like the league. I love the way people live football in this country. I was a little part of the process that made Chelsea a force in the last decade, and I come back with the dream to try to be a little part again of the next decade.'

But the self-proclaimed 'Special One' also conceded that his Chelsea side are still in transition.

'After 10 years of titles and great moments, this is a moment to rebuild again, because teams don't last for ever. Clubs yes, but not the teams. In the same club you have to build another team.'

And Mourinho reserved some special praise for Eden Hazard from last campaign, recognising the Belgian playmaker's contribution after criticising his work rate after Chelsea's Champions League semi final exit against Atletico Madrid.

'I understand this beauty and these magic moments he brings to the game are what the fans enjoy the most,' he assessed.

'People like Eden bring the magic and win matches in one action. They have the flair and the artist's touch of the football.

'He had a big evolution and he scored more goals than before. His work-rate for the team improved a lot too. [He will have] more appetite for the next season to be even better.'

Final puzzle piece: Mourinho has longed for a striker of Diego Costa's calibre and looks to have secured him
