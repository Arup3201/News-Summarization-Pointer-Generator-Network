At first glance these pictures of student life more than a century ago look like they would not be out of place in Downton Abbey.

But on closer inspection, the tell-tale signs of university fun can be seen among the porcelain crockery and pleated curtains.

Because like most American frats of today, Leila Bascom is desperate to show support to her university sports teams. 

This room belonged to Leila Bascom in 1898, and still features tell-tale signs of university life

Leila and her roommate are engrossed in books in this picture where family photos are hung on the wall

The room features an array of pleasant, wooden furnishings and many decorative trinkets

These fraternity members pose with a prize shield in front of Wisconsin memorabilia in this photo, from 1909

The photographs, unearthed from the archives at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, U.S.,show her room proudly adorned with flags and cushions bearing the letter W.

And the similarities do not end there.

While the rooms of today's students are inevitably messier, their counterparts of yesteryear seem just as obsessed with sports, partying and beer.

The house, shown in 1909, features the 
Wisconsin banners shown with even more prominence and the proud students
pose in front with a sporting shield and tankards.

Others from later decades show students smoking and hanging out with friends.

A sports team flag can be seen prominently on this young student's wall

Another version of the flag hangs above the student as he sleeps alongside cut outs of beautiful women

'Masculine' accommodation: An advert for Wisconsin-Madison rooms from 1927

A fixation on sports seems to be a reliable staple in the fraternity house, even as far back as 1912.

Another pair of photograph show with a team insignia taking pride of place in the room.

The pictures are a unique insight into the differences and similarities of student life over the decades.

Smoking in the bedroom would be frowned upon now but was acceptable in the 1920s and 30s

Married students were given special accommodation and this family have space for a high-chair in theirs

By the 1920s the university was keen to use its rooms as a major selling-point for new students.

Hopeful young men were tempted with 'comfortable, masculine' surroundings. Another postcard-style advert boasts of inner-spring mattresses, running water, a full-length mirror, a phone and, crucially, an ironing board.

Pictures from the 1930s show more sparse shared rooms.

Proving just how much times have changed, one student lights a cigarette inside, which would be banned or at least frowned upon today.

These students are a picture of 1950s America and are clean-cut and well-dressed as they pose

Instead of the beer parties of today's undergraduates, these students are happy with slices of melon

Women students also enjoyed themselves and are pictured here having a record party

These pictures show students relaxing and studying inside Wisconsin's dorm rooms 

The university also had special accommodation for married couples and families.

Like a true picture of a 1950s American family, two parents and their daughter were photographed readings and studying in their room.

There were less sedate images from the decade as well.

A group of men - many shirtless - grin for a picture. But, rather than holding bottles of beer like many students, this group are happy with slices of melon.

In another, five women are pictured wearing bobby socks and pearls that were fashionable at the time at a 'record party'.

By the 1960s the rooms begin to look more relaxed and the changing fashions show the new styles

This married couples room is as big as most people's flats and comes with an impressive bookcase and leather chair

It is not only the flares that show this picture was taken in the 1970s but also the prominence beer is given

The uniform style of the 1950s is gone and replaced by a more eclectic style such as this ceiling netting

Images taken in the 1960s and 70s again reflect the era as women are shown as more independent and rooms become more personal and eclectic.

The university was known for its radicalism in the 1970s when undergraduates staged a series of often-violent protests against the Vietnam war.

Pictures show rooms adorned with posters and interesting art.

However, it was not all political. In other images, students play table football next to a giant advertisement for Budweiser. 

For the first time personal televisions are shown in dorms, which are of course common now

The boom times of the 1980s is portrayed in this picture where the students recline next to a fire place. The room is fitted with plush carpets and one student appears to have a personal computer

These enterprising undergrads have set up a student bar inside their room - unthinkable in the earlier pictures

Students of today may be envious of the facilities given to their 1980s counterparts.

In one image, two students recline in their room fitted with a plush carpets and even a fire place.

Every student room these days will have a lap top or PC, but they make their first appearance in dorms in this decade.

By the 1990s, the rooms seem more familiar. Three women laugh as they study on the floor and the scene is replicated a decade later as a group of friends play a boardgame in their room.

These three women in 1996 are hard at work studying on their dorm room floor

These students relax and enjoy a boardgame in their more disheveled room in 2005

The difference between this relaxed 2008 picture of students and those at the end of the 19th century is striking
