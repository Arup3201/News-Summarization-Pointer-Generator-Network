The booing of Gideon Osborne, where we saw that time lapse between the noise and his desperate arranging of his features into insouciance, was 'a moment' that went on for a long time.

I felt sorry for Theresa May - and that is a new emotion - when she got much the same treatment. Feelgood Olympics turns on Feelbad Ministers. Send them to murderball.

But feelings are raw. As the kids go back to school, many parents of children with special needs have just been told they will not be getting help. Access courses are fast disappearing.

The Conservatives may love a conservatory, but allowing even bigger home extensions is a joke as a policy.

The Tories are regrouping to the Right rather than reaching out to those they need to win an Election.

Only Boris, who has used the Olympics as a rally, is doing OK.

The back-to-school feel of politics - a reshuffle and Prime Minister's Questions - seem small fry compared with what is happening out there.

Spain is on fire. There are massive demos. The government is stocking up on tear gas. There are places where miners are using rocket launchers against the police in order to keep their jobs.

Austerity means massive youth unemployment. Work is no answer if there are no jobs.

Depressing: 'The Tories decided to let a generation go to waste'

Still, here it's all runways and loft conversions. The obsession with Heathrow is beyond me and I live in London, so how it plays in other parts of the country is hard to say.

But it's not hard to say that the Tories decided to let large parts of the country and a generation go to waste. The political calculation is that these people were never going to vote Tory anyway.

This is politics devoid of ideas - or even a sense of how this all-white Cabinet appears.

The announcement that Hunt, or 'the back channel' as he was referred to during Leveson, is to be in charge of the NHS is gob-smacking. Most people don't think he should be in charge of a doll's house.

David Laws, who swizzed £40,000 from taxpayers, is back too. In what other job would this be OK?

The moral compass is spinning off the table and yet the man with visibility issues - Ed Miliband - has only just surfaced. Sure, he can have a holiday, and at least his friend has reassured us Ed is now in a 'deep and reflective space'. Coolio. The bottom of a lake?

He has been thinking deep things, though it's hard to know much of anything from the teddy bear-baiting of Prime Minister's Questions.

Cameron cornered is nasty. And this week just plain weird. It was a peculiar carry-on.

Ed Balls sat nodding like some mafioso capo. Clegg, as always, looked as though he was imagining himself elsewhere to get through it, when Cameron lost his rag and blurted to Miliband: 'Apparently, you still have to bring him [Balls] coffee every morning - that's just how assertive and butch the leader of the Opposition really is.'

Morning coffee: 'Is butchness now a measure of growth?'

What is that to do with the price of runways? Is Cameron calling the Labour leader gay? Is it something to do with public-school fagging? Is butchness now a measure of growth, for, if so, Cameron is Queen Bitch.

It's depressing, though, as halfway through the Coalition Government, we don't know what Cameron is for - except cuts, centralisation (education) and privatisation (health).

Labour has to now punch home what it is for, not simply oppose cuts. And who really cares any more what the Lib Dems are for?

After the display of values this country truly treasures at the Olympics, we come back to this?

Booing is mild compared with the political comedown we are facing. Those born to rule have no idea how to actually do so.

This reshuffle is a retreat - forget modernisation and cuddly Tories.

However many glass houses are built, stones will be thrown.

Michelle Obama is an incredible figure. Literally - arms, legs, the works. She has it all. She hugs meaningfully, laughs sexily and is a fine orator.

The speech she gave at the Democrats' convention was a reminder that she and Barack embody the American dream. They knew poverty and they had been young, in love and in debt.

But why do wives have to make these speeches at all? It is political infantilisation of the highest order.

American dream: 'Michelle Obama is an incredible figure - she has it all'

I always thought it was dreadful when they made Sarah Brown tell us she loved her husband at the Labour Party Conference. Is this what women are for? To humanise men?

Last week, though, it was of course Bill Clinton's speech that was more powerful, as the old goat reminded Americans of better economic times.

I was in the South for the last election, where folk would tell you they couldn't vote for Obama ''cos he is different'.

The chat-show hosts focused their out-and-out racism on Michelle in particular.

Yes, this 'uppity woman' does represent what America can be - but her sweet talk cannot remove the fact America is still a very divided nation.

I do try with The Great British Bake Off, but it's another world to me. This is not helped by my youngest chanting 'No one cares' all the way through.

Like her mother, she tends to the view that cake is to be eaten, not filmed.

But I do see one must have reached a kind of state of Zen enlightenment when the biggest worry you have is 'wet fruit' or 'poor marbling' in a tart/pie/cake situation.

Huge whoops in my house when Jonnie Peacock powered to victory. He lost his leg at five to meningococcal septicaemia. One of my children had that and we were told to expect the worst.

The worst didn't happen. Paediatric intensive care is the NHS at it finest.

But ever since then, I have heard from people, like Peacock, who have lost limbs or hearing and gone on to all kinds of great things.

Doctors are closer than ever to a vaccine for this terrible illness. I will be celebrating his medal with a donation to the Meningitis Research Foundation (meningitis.org). Do join me.

Prince Harry is more popular than ever since those naked pictures. Let’s hope no other Royals embrace this strategy.

We now see why he was partying, as he is going back to Afghanistan.

I wish no soldiers harm but this is mission impossible. Why is he going? Why are any of our young men and women still going? Why?
