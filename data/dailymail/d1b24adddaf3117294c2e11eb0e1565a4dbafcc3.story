With the European champions coming to town and giving Liverpool a lesson in a 3-0 defeat, fans at Anfield will have found it hard to take any positives home with them.

Here's five things we've learnt about Liverpool from their Champions League struggles: 

It might be time to give Rickie Lambert a go... 

Many thought a mouth-watering tie against the Champions League holders might be the sort of occasion that would get Mario Balotelli performing to his potential.

Instead, the enigmatic Italian attempted just 17 passes and had zero shots on target before being hooked at half-time after swapping shirts with Pepe.

It was always going to be a tough evening for the 24-year-old as a lone striker, but he wasted any promising moves started by his team-mates and his hold-up play was non-existent.

Maybe it’s time to give Rickie Lambert a run in the side. He would at least look interested if nothing else.

Liverpool's centre back pairing just isn't working

The Anfield club’s first-choice centre backs Dejan Lovren and Martin Skrtel are undeniably strong in the air, but the pair look too similar to form an effective partnership on the deck.

Both are aggressive and their tendency to dive into tackles leaves huge holes in and behind Liverpool’s back line.

In the Premier League Liverpool play a high defensive line, which often allows opposition attackers a clear run on goal when the centre backs have committed themselves.

They tried to compensate for this against Real Madrid’s myriad of attacking talent by playing deeper, but neither Skrtel nor Lovren looked comfortable in a more passive, covering role and Ronaldo and Co ran rings around them.

Three points from three games leave hopes hanging by a thread

The atmosphere at Anfield before kick-off may have been as electric as ever, but at the moment it’s the only thing that remains from Liverpool’s European glory days – besides Steven Gerrard, of course.

Granted, they were playing the Champions League holders on Wednesday night but the Galacticos had never so much as scored against the Merseyside club before, let alone beaten them.

This time it was emphatic - Liverpool's first ever home European defeat by three goals.

Then there was the 1-0 defeat at Basel earlier in the month, as well as the laboured victory over Ludogorets in September.

They’re halfway through the group stage and Liverpool’s Champions League status is already hanging by a thread – probably not the return to the big stage Gerrard had in mind.

The Kop were in fine voice to begin with but were silenced by Real Madrid's first-half show of strength

The opening 22 minutes looked strong, but they tired 

Liverpool were long odds to beat Madrid before the match, and understandably so, but their performance in the first 22 minutes may have had the bookies squirming in their seats.

The Reds made an excellent start and surged into Real’s penalty box on numerous occasions, but Cristiano Ronaldo’s opener knocked them for six and they looked too exhausted to claw their way back into the game.

Clearly, Sunday’s hard-fought win over QPR took a lot out of them – eight of the starting XI at Loftus Road began the match with Carlo Ancelotti’s side.

Liverpool set about re-investing the money from Luis Suarez’s transfer in numerous players after it was adjudged that the size of their squad would not allow them to compete effectively in four competitions this season.

However, the foreign signings are struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality of the English game, and it’s now clear how invaluable a player with the work-rate and engine of  Suarez really is.

A return to Europe's top table might have come too soon 

Has the Champions League come too soon for Liverpool? It’s what the club and the fans were desperate for during their three-year absence from the competition, but their demolition by Real Madrid showed just how far off the pace they are.

In order to bridge the gap between them and the current European big guns, they will need to re-establish themselves as a Champions League club and put together a long run in the competition, giving them the opportunity to build the level of squad required.

However, with a decent run in this year’s tournament looking unlikely and their Premier League form shaky, Liverpool’s return to the Champions League might be their last appearance in the competition for some time.

Liverpool have won five European Cups but perhaps their return to this competition came too soon?
