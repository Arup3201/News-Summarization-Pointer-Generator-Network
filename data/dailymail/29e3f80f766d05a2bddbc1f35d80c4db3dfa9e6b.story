A woman who lost her brother in the 2002 Bali bombings has called for calm amid a climate of rising racial tension in Australia and urged Prime Minister Tony Abbott not pursue a policy of 'fear-mongering'.

Georgia Lysaght, 30, lost her brother Scott, then 33, in the terrorist attack in Indonesia 13 years ago which claimed the lives of 202 people, including 88 Australians.

But rather than let the tragedy fill the rest of her life with hatred, Ms Lysaght has dedicated her time to encouraging peace and understanding.

After the terrors raids and the shooting of a terror suspect in Melbourne - prompting the Australian government to increase the country's alert level - she penned an open letter to Mr Abbott.

In her open letter to the Australian Prime Minister, she urges him to help the voices of moderate and tolerant Australians be heard over those who would pursue initiatives which would divide the nation.

The 'Bali bombings' on October 12, 2002, killed 202 people, including 81 Australians, and injured hundreds more.

At the time of the blast, Georgia Lysaght's brother Scott was with teammates from the Jakarta ISCI Dragons rugby club, where they were playing in a local tournament. 

The team had just pulled up in three taxis out the front of the Sari Club, where the bombing occurred, when the blast went off.

Scott was killed immediately by the car bomb, and none at the head of the convoy survived. 

He left behind his wife of nine years, Melissa, and their newborn daughter Madeleine. 

Now his sister, a research fellow with the Centre for Transnational Crime Prevention at Woollongong University, is urging Tony Abbott to help the voices of moderate and tolerant Australians be heard, over those who would pursue initiatives which would divide the nation.

'Mr Abbott, during this time of international uncertainty and Australian involvement in what is a terribly violent conflict, I am appealing to you not to run a campaign of fear,' she wrote on Mamamia. 

'For every cross-cultural friendship, for every conversation started rather than an accusation launched, for every social media site promoting unity against violence, we can hope to dampen radicalism in our own way. This is the ultimate non-violent protest.' 

This is the very point which she is calling the Australian Prime Minister to remember, stating that 'the government’s efforts to prevent a terror attack in Australia must include strategies that promote cross-cultural knowledge, respect, and tolerance,' she wrote.

'I felt sick when Australia’s terror alert was raised, and media coverage increased on the possibility of a terror attack in Australia,'

'I felt sick not because of the steps the government had undertaken, but because once again I witnessed a surge of racism and bigotry across social media and on the comments section of news sites.' 

Reflecting on the responses of everyday Australians to the Bali bombings, Ms Lysaght said that whilst she was overwhelmed by the support and kindness she and her family received, she witnessed a large proportion of others respond with racism, persecution and hatred.

Ms Lysaght said that her brother's death motivated her to undertake a PhD which focused on the case study of Indonesia, in order that she could understand more fully that the terrorists did not represent the nation

Ms Lysaght recalled one incident where a caller on talkback radio suggested the government round 'them' (the terrorists) up in the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the families of the victims to beat up, sickening her.

'I did not want any act of violence, racism, or bigotry to be justified in my brother’s name, my family’s name, or my name,' she wrote. 

More recently, Ms Lysaght said she was horrified by the public's reaction to Australian Muslims, including a rise in attacks which have included  the 'vandalism of mosques, a baby’s pram being kicked, a mother being spat on, and a pig’s head being impaled on a cross.'

Ms Lysaght said that her brother's death motivated her to undertake a PhD which focused on the case study of Indonesia, in order that she could understand more fully that the terrorists did not represent the nation.

'After Scott died, I made the deliberate decision to act as a proponent of peace in my own small way, by actively engaging with people from cross-cultural backgrounds, exercising respect and tolerance, standing up to racism, and expanding my knowledge about the world around me.' 

In her final words to the Prime Minister, she urges him not to divide the nation in fear, and risk alienating minorities further. 

'Please help the voices of moderate, tolerant Australians be heard so that we may be unflinching in our support of one another to strengthen our resolve and resilience against the darker forces in this world,' she wrote.
