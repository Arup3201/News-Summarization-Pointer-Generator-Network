Future: Footballer Ched Evans, pictured with girlfriend Natasha Massey, is set to be offered a £5,000-a-week deal with former club Sheffield United

Rapist footballer Ched Evans is set to be offered a two-year contract by his former club worth more than £500,000, it has been claimed.

Evans, an international striker for Wales, was released from Wymott prison yesterday having served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl in his home town of Rhyl.

But it seems the 25-year-old might now get his career on track - just one day after his pre-dawn release from jail. 

A source told The Sun that the 25-year-old had been offered a deal, worth £5,000-a-week, and was expected to sign it.

The source said: 'Sheffield United are the only club to have made him an offer and have been waiting for him to be released before announcing it.

'He's going to be loyal to them because the club's stuck by him.'

It is understood that as a condition of the contract, Evans - who continued to maintain his claims of 'absolute innocence' of rape yesterday - must make a public apology.

The source added that, despite considering himself an innocent man, the footballer will apologise as 'he knows saying sorry will help his public image'. 

If it goes through, the deal would mark a significant paycut for the footballer, whose last contract with the League One club, which expired in June, was worth £20,000-a-week.

And it could see the player return to training at the Yorkshire club as early as next week, according to The Sun. 

Sheffield United today issued a statement that said the club had not offered Evans a formal contract.

The revelation came as it emerged that fans who are caught chanting songs during matches that 'celebrate' Evans' crime or ridicule his victim will face serious punishment. 

If reference is made to his crime, in particular the name of his victim, then police would act against any person involved. Revealing the name of a rape victim is a criminal offence.  

The Football Association told the Daily Mirror: 'If supporters chant songs that praise the offender or ridicule, or possibly identify the victim, the FA will contact the club to discuss what measures they can take to prevent this. 

'These include messaging supporters through local media or directly through the club's communication channels.'

Fans can be banned for life from football clubs if they use foul, abusive or racist language at matches. 

Earlier this week, Sheffield United claimed publicly that they were still wrestling with the moral dilemma of having a convicted rapist in their team.

Their co-chairman, Jim Phipps, said that they were 'puzzling' through the problem and said that they would not necessarily reach a decision any time soon. 

While their manager Nigel Clough said this week that he would leave the decision to his employers.

New deal: The striker, who scored 48 goals in 113 games for Sheffield United before he was jailed, could begin training with the Yorkshire club as early as next week, according to a report in The Sun

Today, Sheffield United's co-Chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps released a brief, joint statement. 

It said: 'Sheffield United has become aware of speculative media coverage concerning the immediate future of its former player Ched Evans.

'An article in The Sun today that Sheffield United has offered a contract to former player Ched Evans is false and damaging to the Club. 

'We have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long term decision about Ched Evans.' 

Secrecy: Earlier this week a club spokesman refused to comment on the fact they continued to pay Evans's £20,000-a-week wages for more than three months after he was jailed. Above, Evans with girlfriend Natasha

The Club offered no further comment.  

Earlier this week a club spokesman refused to comment on the fact they continued to pay Evans's £20,000-a-week wages for more than three months after he was jailed.

The club released him at the end of a contract that expired on June 30, but they chose not to sack him.

Judy Finnigan sparked fury during her debut as a panellist on Loose Women this week when she suggested Evans should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was 'drunk' and the rape was 'unpleasant' but 'not violent'.

Today, the veteran broadcaster said that she has horrified by the online backlash suffered by her husband, daughter and herself.

Writing in the Daily Express, Ms Finnigan said that 'the stuff the debased and degenerate human beings unleashed' against her 27-year-old daughter Chloe 'astonished and frightened her'.

She said that rape threats were made against her and her daughter.

Ms Finnigan added that she hoped 'there is a special place in hell reserved for trolls'.

The striker had a successful career with Sheffield United before he was jailed, scoring 48 goals in 113 games.

Evans, who has been capped 13 times by Wales, cost £3million when Sheffield United bought him from Manchester City in July 2009.

The club's manager and co-owner Kevin McCabe visited Evans in jail in April, reportedly to invite him back to training on his release.

And there has been a suggestion dialogue continued throughout his imprisonment between Evans's family and his representatives and the club.

Wales boss Chris Coleman has said he would have to look at Evans' selection 'in great detail' with Football Association of Wales (FAW) officials 'because of the magnitude of the situation'. 

Earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, a Sheffield MP, warned the football club against re-employing a convicted rapist and Richard Caborn added his voice to the debate. 

Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg warned club bosses they cannot 'wish away' the rape conviction and must remember that the players are not just a footballers but role models to millions of fans. 

On the official Ched Evans website, his supporters insist he is a role model who will 'make a personal and profound statement by video' next week.  

Evans was jailed for five years in 2012 after being convicted of raping a drunken 19-year-old after a former team-mate invited her back to a hotel room in his home town of Rhyl, North Wales.

He admitted having sex with her, but the woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident.  

Last night, an online petition against Evans return to Sheffield United had attracted more than 150,000 signatures. 

The petition, set up by feminist campaigner Jean Hatchet, calls on Kevin McCabe, chairman of Sheffield United, where Evans played until he was jailed, to 'refuse to reinstate Ched Evans as a player'. 

Yesterday, a steady stream of well-wishers called at his family home ahead of an expected celebration, with relatives having flown in from all over the world for the reunion. 

His girlfriend Natasha Masssey, who has been the victim of Twitter trolls for choosing to stay with the football player, was also expected to attend.   

An appeal against Evans' conviction was rejected in 2012. Yesterday his family said they were confident an application to the Criminal Cases Review Committee for a second appeal would succeed.
