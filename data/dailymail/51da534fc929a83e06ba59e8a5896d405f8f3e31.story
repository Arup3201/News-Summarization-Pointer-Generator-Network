Costing £215 for 100g at Fortnum & Masons and taking up to 35 years to mature, Beluga caviar is among the most exclusive of foods.

So when discount supermarket Aldi said they would be selling 20g portions of the luxurious delicacy for £9.99, more than a few eyebrows in the fine foods industry were raised.

And now the store has admitted that their product is not Beluga caviar at all, after an expert revealed that the supermarket's product is from the wrong type of sturgeon.

Fishy: Aldi's 'Beluga' caviar is not made from roe from the Husa husa sturgeon, the supermarket has admitted

Beluga caviar can only consist of roe from the Huso huso sturgeon, according to World Health Organisation food standards.

The critically endangered species is found in the Caspian, Adriatic and Black seas and takes between 18 and 35 years to mature, driving up overhead costs for producers.

None of the caviar sold by Aldi from December 21 are from the Huso huso sturgeon, the Independent on Sunday reported.

It will instead use caviar produced by river and Amur sturgeon in China, which have no relation to the Huso huso species.

Kenneth Benning, from London Fine Foods and the UK's only caviar farm, Exmoor Caviar, said Aldi's addition of the word 'Beluga' would confuse shoppers.

He said: 'As a trader in caviar, there is not a farm on the planet that can sell Beluga caviar for Aldi's claimed price. 

Aldi instead used Amur sturgeon and river sturgeon (file picture) for its caviar, which could explain why it costs four-times less than Beluga caviar from Fortnum & Mason

A caviar expert has claimed that Aldi's use of the word 'Beluga' will confuse shoppers when the product goes on sale on December 21

'Given how long it takes to mature the species, many farms have now started to mix sturgeons to try and create a 'Beluga-ish' product they can try to sell as ‘Beluga’, whereby the male Huso huso is crossed with another faster-growing species such as sterlet or baeri. 

'This is known as a hybrid cross. However a hybrid cross such as ‘Huso Sterlet’ is not such a headline grabbing name as the well-known ‘Beluga’ caviar.

'The adding of the word ‘Beluga’ in Aldi’s product implies something that is actually not its origin or value. Hence this caviar has no correlation whatsoever to ‘Beluga’ caviar or the Huso huso sturgeon. Aldi should rectify this.'

Aldi, which has gradually made gains on the UK's four big supermarkets by tempting shoppers with cheap deals, admitted the Christmas caviar is not from the Huso huso sturgeon.

A spokesman for the supermarket said: We can offer shoppers Amur Beluga caviar at an exceptional price by making savings across the business, which we pass onto our customers rather than boost our margins.

'This Christmas customers will be able to enjoy Amur Beluga caviar which comes from Amur Beluga sturgeon, a hybrid of the Amur sturgeon and the river Beluga sturgeon. 

'All of our information on the packaging explains to customers the origin of the caviar and we are confident that people will enjoy this special treat on Christmas Day.'
