While she’s been a mainstay at the Kennedy’s estate in Cape Cod this summer, apparently country music darling Taylor Swift wasn’t so welcome at a Kennedy wedding.

Mother of the bride Victoria Gifford Kennedy told the Boston Herald yesterday that the 22-year-old singer was twice asked to leave the ceremony at a Boston hotel, but did not.

Victoria told the paper that Swift and her new boyfriend Conor Kennedy, the eldest son of RFk Jr., texted an hour before the wedding asking to come, to which she responded with a polite but firm ‘no.’

She told the Herald: ‘They came anyway…I personally went up to Ms Swift, whose entrance distracted the entire event…and asked her as nicely as I could to leave.’

Swift’s spokesperson, Paula Erikson, did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for comment, but told the Herald quite the contrary – that the waifish blonde was indeed invited, and moreover was graciously welcomed by the bride, Kyle Kennedy.

Kyle is the daughter of Michael LeMoyne Kennedy and the granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 in a Los Angeles Hotel.

Her father Michael tragically died in a skiing accident in Aspen, Colorado in 1997.

Conor is Kyle’s first cousin, and according to Victoria, was invited to the nuptials with Liam Kerr, a director for education reform.

However, Conor never bothered to RSVP.

According to the Herald, Swift and Conor showed up in the lobby of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel, where fans eagerly asked the star for her autograph.

The luxurious hotel, located in Boston's historic Back Bay neighbourhood, was built in 1912, and has been host to countless society events.

The mother of the bride said that the young couple left the hotel during the dinner at the reception, but returned to dance.

She added that she didn’t want Swift to attend because it would take the focus off of her daughter and new son-in-law.

The day after Saturday's wedding, the 22-year-old Grammy winner accompanied her boyfriend, along with his other siblings, on a sombre visit to his mother’s grave in St. Francis Xavier Cemetery.

The New York Daily News, which obtained exclusive pictures of the visit, reported that Swift and Kennedy walked hand-in-hand to the Hyannis, Massachusetts cemetery.

Exclusive video by ET shows that the couple rarely let go of each others' hands.

Connor was wearing a grey T-shirt and shorts, with Swift looking summery in a red floral print A-line dress, Ray Ban sunglasses, and leather shoes.

The couple, who was seen caressing at the ceremony just a day before, appeared solemn at his mother’s grave, and at one point appeared to bow their heads in prayer, as did Kennedy’s siblings.

According to the Daily News, Kennedy also reached down to clear some brambles and overgrown grass from his mother’s yet-unmarked grave.

Mary Kennedy, 52, hanged herself on May 16 in a barn behind the couple’s home in Bedford, New York, amid bitter divorce proceedings and a battle with depression and addiction.

Swift, who is said to be worth as much as $80million, reportedly purchased a $5million Cape Cod mansion next to the Kennedy’s sprawling estate. 

Before the sombre visit, the young couple attended mass together.

The two have been sighted around Cape Cod and Nantucket throughout the summer, walking hand-in-hand on the Cape’s pristine beaches, and even stealing a kiss or two on the docks.
