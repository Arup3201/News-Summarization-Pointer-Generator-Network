A troubled schoolgirl who threw herself in front of a train had been mourning a former classmate who killed herself in the same way, an inquest heard yesterday.

Mary Stroman, 16, had talked about Tallulah Wilson’s suicide and her mother said the death had ‘played on Mary’s mind’.

She died while an inquest was being held into the death of gifted ballerina Tallulah, 15.

Mary Stroman, left, died after being hit by a train in January this year during the inquest of Tallulah Wilson, right. Tallulah, 15, killed herself at London's St Pancras station in October 2012

The girls were classmates at St Marylebone School in Central London but Mary was taken out of the school after one term when her family discovered she was self-harming.

Her mother Sue said Mary had been upset about Tallulah’s suicide, and that when the inquest started, she had told staff who were caring for her – at a residential home for girls with emotional difficulties – to keep an eye on her.

Two days after she heard about the inquest, Mary left suicide notes in her bedroom at the care unit and died after she was hit by a train on a nearby railway line. 

A coroner investigating her death heard she had a long history of self-harm and suicide attempts and had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Mrs Stroman, 58, from Finsbury Park, North London, said her daughter had been a popular, straight-A student but became withdrawn and secretive after she turned 13. 

Mary refused to reveal what had happened to change her behaviour but did tell friends she had been raped, and suffered nightmares and flashbacks.

Mrs Stroman said she had tried to ask Mary – the youngest of five children – what had happened but she had refused to discuss it, and had refused counselling, but had once referred to herself as ‘a whore’.

Mary, 16, was troubled by Tallulah's death. Her mother Sue told the inquest: 'Tallulah played on Mary's mind and if we were going through Kings Cross Mary would say 'This is where Tallulah died''

In 2013, Mary was admitted to Tumblewood Community, a care home for girls near Westbury in Wiltshire. 

While there, her mother said she told her about the inquest into Tallulah’s death at London’s St Pancras station. 

She added: ‘Tallulah played on Mary’s mind. We would go through King’s Cross and she would say, “That’s where Tallulah died”.

'My concerns where that she would pick it up (news of the hearing) from the papers.'

The court heard Mary was a 'shy' as a child but 'popular at school'.

In a statement read in court, Mrs Stroman said: 'She was a shy child and was wise. She was a small and delicate child.

'She was a popular child at school and was invited to parties.'

But the inquest also heard Mary had a history of self harm – and at her parent's wedding anniversary in August 2010, she had gotten 'very drunk'.

The teenager, who was the youngest of five children, started to scratch her face and bite her hand and was 'hearing voices in her head'.  

She spent several months in The Priory clinic in London in three spells and also stayed at Simmons House adolescent unit in London.

Mary was then diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder in 2011.

Her mother added her Mary's decline in health had begun after she started feeling 'unsafe' in her local community and was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

The two girls were laboratory partners in science classes at St Marylebone and played in the school orchestra together.

Sue and Scott Stroman arrive at the inquest into their daughter Mary's death in Salisbury, Wiltshire, today

Tallulah had killed herself in October 2012 after becoming obsessed with websites glamourising self-harm and suicide. 

When she died, Mary was receiving treatment at The Priory clinic and was 'sad' at hearing the news of her friend's death.

'I think I wanted to safeguard her for a bit when Tallulah took her own life because Mary was in the Priory.

The inquest also heard Mrs Stroman had spoken to Mary about Tallulah 's inquest in a cafe nearher Wiltshire school.

Coroner David Ridley asked Mrs Stroman whether Mary appeared upset when she heard about the inquest.

Mrs Stroman, who is a nurse, said she then rang the school to tell them to keep an eye on Mary as she might be upset.

She said her daughter was ‘matter of fact’ about the inquest and had seemed ‘chirpy’ during a phone call the next day.

'She was quite chirpy, slightly uncharacteristically chirpy. She said she had been up to school and she was just starting her programme with the horses and she was looking forward to it.

'I had just started my new job and she asked me about that and she asked if everybody was fine.'

'After she had already died, I texted her 'goodnight'.'

The inquest also heard of another incident where Mary went to railway tracks and contemplated suicide – but stopped because it was her brother's birthday.

And later Mary apologised for being a 'suicidal daughter'. 

Mr Ridley, reading Mrs Stroman's statement, said: 'She apologised to me and said she was 'sorry that you had a suicidal daughter'.

Mr Ridley told the court: 'When you were celebrating your 30th wedding anniversary in August 2010, Mary was very drunk and other people were trying to get her away from the other adults.

The inquest heard Mary, pictured left and right, had a history of self-harming. At the time of her death, the teenager was living at a residential school for girls with emotional and behavioural difficulties

'She was sick as a result of the alcohol.

'You took Mary to hospital and nurses noticed Mary had been self harming on her arms and she told the nurse she had done this before.

'She was then reported to the local community mental health team.

'You said 'she handed a knife to me and said she had been sleeping with this - we then realised we needed help and this was more serious'.

'In 2011 her doctor said Mary had been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. In September 2011 she was hearing voices in her head.

'Mary would get into a rage and she said to you 'you fucked us all up'.'

The inquest also heard that Mary would often claim to have been assaulted and also wrote a letter to a friend stating she had been assaulted and raped and also had been hearing voices in her head. 

The teenager, who as a keen musician playing the viola and piano, was very private and did not share her worries because she was concerned about confidentiality.

The coroner heard that Mary was described as a 'perfectionist' who had been a straight A student, despite her inner turmoil.

Mrs Stroman said she was speaking to her daughter daily when she was living at Tumblewood Community School.

'I knew she was struggling and I know Tumblewood were trying to reach her. She didn't like the therapy but was comfortable with Dr Eastgate,' she said.

'Mary said to me there was no point in her being there as she was not being monitored and she must tell them what was wrong. I told her to talk to them but she just couldn't do it.

'I don't think in my opinion Tumblewood did anything wrong, Mary just wouldn't let anyone in to talk to her about what had happened to her.

'I spoke to Mary for about 20 minutes on the day she died. On the previous Monday I did tell her about the inquest into Tallulah had begun. Mary didn't say much about it and she sounded okay to me.' 

The St Marylebone School, in London, which schoolgirls Tallulah Wilson and Mary Stroman both attended

After several incidents of self-harming, she was admitted on three separate occasions to The Priory, as well as the Simmons House psychiatric unit in London.

'Mary was quite secretive. I could never stop her from self-harming completely. Her self-harming was a release for her from her anxiety - it was a coping mechanism,' Mrs Stroman said.

'She knew she needed help but throughout this was not able to disclose what happened to her.

'She couldn't take the final step to trust people with what happened. One time she said 'I am a whore, that's what I am mamma'.'

Karen Briddon, a project care worker at Tumblewood Community School, went into Mary's room the day she died and found two suicide notes – one for her family and another to a friend.

There was no answer and she opened the door to find a note saying 'I've gone out'.

She told the inquest it was 'unusual' for Mary to leave a note because she would normally just leave.

Mrs Briddon said 'alarm bells' were ringing so she carried out an internal search of her room and found the notes.

One of the notes was for her family and the other was addressed to a friend.

Mrs Briddon told the court she went straight to the train station.

'When I got there a message over the tannoy said trains are delayed because someone has been hit by a train,' she said.

Tallulah Wilson's inquest had heard claims that she had been bullied at St Marylebone School, which she attended until the summer of 2012 before moving to St Margaret's School in Hampstead, north London, weeks before her death.

Mary’s father, Scott, a musician and jazz professor, also attended the inquest at Salisbury Coroner’s Court but did not give evidence. 

The inquest into Mary's death continues.
