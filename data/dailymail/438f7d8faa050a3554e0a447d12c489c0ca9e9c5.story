Under fire: Jamie Oliver has faced stinging criticism since he suggested British workers are lazier than Europeans

Jamie Oliver has received a barrage of criticism after his attack on young British workers branding them lazy compared with his 'tougher' immigrant staff.

The 38-year-old celebrity chef sparked outrage yesterday after he claimed that his restaurant empire would be forced to close if he had to rely only on Britons.

Chefs, political groups and the general public lined up to defend British workers saying they are hard-working and reliable.

Migration Watch vice-chairman Alp 
Mehmet said it was unfair to compare immigrants desperate for a job with
 young Britons trying to establish a career.

'Jamie Oliver is simply wrong,' he told MailOnline. 'It wasn't that long ago that he was a young British worker.

'This
 generalisation is wrong and it's damaging.

'Hundreds of thousands of 
young British people are very hard-working and bright and desperate for a
 job.'

A spokesman for UKIP
 echoed his comments: 'To simply say that British workers aren't as good
 as European or foreign workers is insulting and inaccurate. There might
 be some workers that give British workers a bad name but it's not the 
vast majority.'

Fellow celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson insisted Brits were often better.

Criticism: Alp Mehmet, from MigrationWatch, said Jamie Oliver is 'simply wrong' about British workers

He told the Mirror: 'A lot of European staff are good workers, but they don't have that passion for food.

'When
 I find a young Brit I find them incredibly creative and enthusiastic. 
The country needs young people to train as there aren't enough young 
British chefs. We need to encourage them, rather than knock them.'

Essex-born Oliver,
 who worked his way up from the kitchen in his father’s Essex pub, said 
working an 80 to 100-hour week was 'really normal' when he started his 
career.

But he said young British workers nowadays don't have the same work ethic.

'The EU 
regulation now is 48 hours, which is half a week’s work for me. And they
 still whinge about it!' he said.

‘British
 kids particularly, I have never seen anything so wet behind the ears. I
 have mummies phoning up for 23-year-olds saying to me, “My son is too 
tired.” On a 48-hour-week! Are you having a laugh?

‘I
 think our European immigrant friends are much stronger, much tougher. 
If we didn’t have any, all of my restaurants would close tomorrow. There
 wouldn’t be any Brits to replace them.’

Jamie Oliver’s food range products cost up to seven times more than supermarket own-brand equivalents - while he lectures the poor about eating healthily and cheaply.

The celebrity chef's new television show and accompanying cookery book sees him steering families away from spending money on expensive ready meals and convenience foods.

But the 38-year-old has put his name to ready-to-eat dishes that are much pricier than supermarkets' own brands.

A foodbank charity has now questioned why people would pay more for products just because it had a celebrity's picture on the packet.

But several British chefs voiced their disagreement.

Chef Sam Carlton, who works at a brasserie in Halifax, wrote on Twitter: 'I'm a British female chef who works over 48hrs and doesn't whinge. Don't tarnish us all.'

Chef Mike Counsel said: 'So Jamie Oliver employs immigrants 
because British workers are soft? Is he for 
real? ‏The guy has forgotten his roots and should be ashamed'

Many took to Twitter to pour scorn on Oliver, arguing that he should have more faith in the country's youth.

One wrote: 'Jamie no points for loyalty; will remember when next dining out.'

Another said: 'I won't be wasting my 
cash in his restaurants'

'What Jamie Oliver said about young British workers is disgusting,' wrote one.

'Hard-working': Sam Carlton, 25, said British chefs work long hours and don't complain

Sam Carlton, 25, said she felt 'insulted' by Jamie's attack on young British chefs.

The female sous chef has been working in kitchens since she left school at the age of 16 and says she has had to graft tirelessly to make her way in the industry.

After stints in hotels, restaurants and even a period of working in the U.S with the Marriott Hotel chain, she gained the experience which helped her gain her current job at gastro-pub the Brasserie At The Bull in Halifax.

'Everywhere I've worked, I've always worked long hours - it just comes as standard,' she told MailOnline. 'All the other chefs I've worked with have been the same. We don't complain - it's just what the job entails.

'I've had to sacrifice to be a chef. I can't remember the last time I had a weekend off and I've had one Christmas at home in the past nine years. We slog our guts off but Jamie's comments have tarnished us all.

'These celebrity chefs are missing the point.'

In fact, Sam said in some cases it was European, rather than British, staff who had found the long hours of the catering industry a problem.

'In my experience, it's been 
foreign workers who have complained about the working hours,' she said. 'They 
weren't used to it compared to their country.

'When I worked in America the hours we're actually shorter because that's just how it is over there.

'And when I worked in North Yorkshire we had some Spanish waiting staff and they were shocked at how many hours we work.

'Chefs in this country know what the job entails and just get on with it because it's not about that - it's about the passion.'
