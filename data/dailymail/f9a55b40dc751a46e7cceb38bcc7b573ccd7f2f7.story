The artist whose iconic work adorned Airfix model aeroplane boxes has put the final batch of his orginal sketches and drawings up for sale for £20,000.

Roy Cross, 90, of Kent, was the principal artist for Airfix during the Sixties and Seventies at the peak of the model kits' popularity, and created hundreds of images of the world’s most famous aircraft.

His paintings then adorned the boxes of the popular plastic scale models - which were loved worldwide by children and adults.

Some 50 years since his first Airfix painting, Mr Cross, has decided to put the last of his original works up for auction to clear space in his studio.

The collection of 49 drawings, watercolours and box lids, is tipped to fetch £20,000 when it goes under the hammer on July 24 at auction house Vectis in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham.

Among the highlights are Mr Cross’s original watercolour paintings of a Boeing Sea Knight helicopter and a German Blohm and Voss BV141, and charcoal sketches of a Lancaster bomber and a De Havilland Mosquito.

Some of the sketches were rejected by Airfix and never made it into production, making them all the more rare.

Simon Clarke, an expert at Vectis, said: ‘Roy Cross was the foremost illustrator for Airfix in the company’s heyday in the Sixties and Seventies.

'He did the iconic artwork for all the classic Airfix kits that captured the hearts and minds of a generation.

‘His work is instantly recognisable and was loved so much because it captured the beauty power of these magnificent planes.

'Roy would initially sketch a scene then present it to Airfix for their approval. Most of his ideas were given the thumbs up but others were rejected.

'Some of the items in the sale actually have the word "no" written on them. They never made it into production and are therefore unseen.

‘Roy is now 90 and was recently having a clear-out of his studio and has now consigned to us the last major tranche of his work. The collection is in virtually mint condition.’
