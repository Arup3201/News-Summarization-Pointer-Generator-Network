A seaside resort’s prized Banksy has been boarded over by hotel owners, who fear vandals will strike and ruin the 8ft high artwork. 

The picture of a little boy drawing a giant robot was painted on the side of  The Grosvenor in Torquay, Devon, three years ago by the famous guerrilla artist.

Residents had feared the hotel’s facade had been completely repainted - including the artwork - which is believed to be worth around £500,000.

But hotel owners had actually placed a board over the work which was then painted - to stop vandals striking again.

General manager Rebecca Snowball said: 'The decorating team has preserved the Banksy.

'It has been boarded over and they have painted over the cover. It has been kept safely behind.

'It had already been damaged when somebody threw acid over it a while ago. But we are redecorating the whole building and they were unsure about the best thing to do about the Banksy.'

The Grosvenor was made famous by TV’s The Hotel series but its ex-owner Mark Jenkins sold it to Keith Richardson.

The former owner had placed a perspex covering over the Banksy to protect it but vandals were still able to obliterate half the image last year.

Vandals broke through perspex protecting the painting and doused the wall with paint stripper, and 'obliterated' the little boy.

At the time Mark Jenkins, the hotel owner, said he was appalled that someone had gone out of their way to damage something which made Torquay 'a little bit special'.

Two additions of a small CCTV camera and a toy soldier were made to the original image in 2010 but it is not known whether they were the work of the celebrated graffiti artist.

Mr Jenkins said the mural had become a tourist attraction in itself with many visitors to the bay stopping to take a picture.
