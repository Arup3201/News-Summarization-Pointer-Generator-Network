Booker prize-winner Julian Barnes has opened his heart over the despair he felt at the loss of his  wife and how her death from cancer five-years ago left him on the brink of suicide.

Literary agent Pat Kavanagh died just 37 days after being diagnosed with a brain tumour, leaving the 67-year-old novelist utterly devastated.

As he struggled to come to terms his loss, Barnes lashed out at well-meaning friends and began to harbour deep resentment towards the world.

In his latest book, Levels of Life, 
Barnes tells how he spiralled into deep depression and regularly 
contemplated suicide even describing the method he had decided to use.

'I knew soon enough my preferred 
method', he writes. 'A hot bath, a glass of wine next to the taps, and 
an exceptionally sharp Japanese carving knife. I thought of that 
solution fairly often, and still do.'

In another passage Barnes rationalises his
desire to end his own life, setting a macabre timescale: 'I will give 
it x months, or x years (up to a maximum of two), and then, if I cannot 
live without her, if my life is reduced to mere passive continuance, I 
shall become active.'

Barnes, 67, won the Man Booker prize 
for his 2011 novel The Sense of an Ending about a man's investigation 
into the mysterious suicide of a friend.

Levels of Life 
is dedicated to Kavanagh, who represented the literary greats Robert 
Harris, John Mortimer, Ruth Rendell, John Irving and Tom Wolfe, and 
features a picture of her on the back cover.

In one moving passage he tells how he now rubs oil into the 
'drying oak of her grave-marker', When before he used to rub oil into 
the dry skin on her back and how her old keyring now carries just two 
keys -  one for his house and one for the cemetery gate.

Contacted by the Times newspaper to discuss the book he declined an interview.

Angry at a world which 'couldn't, 
wouldn't save her', and the failure of religion to offer any sort of 
comfort he managed to pull back from the brink realising that ending his
own life, would end memories of her.

'I could not kill myself because then I would also be killing her. She would die a second time,' he writes.
