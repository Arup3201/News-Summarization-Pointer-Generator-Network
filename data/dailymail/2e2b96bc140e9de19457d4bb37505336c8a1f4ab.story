He may be out of the Wimbledon championships – but the reasons for Andy Murray’s four-letter outbursts during his humiliating defeat by Grigor Dimitrov were still being feverishly discussed yesterday.

Did a row with his girlfriend Kim Sears a few minutes before play prompt him to turn towards the players’ box and shout incredulously: ‘Five minutes before the f***ing match?’

Had there been a disagreement with his new coach Amelie Mauresmo? And who was the target of his ‘Shut the f*** up!’ attack, which he screamed in the direction of Miss Sears, Miss Mauresmo and his mother Judy Murray?

Contrite? Murray arrives at coach Amelie Mauresmo's house yesterday with a card... and leaves in good spirits

Here – as Murray prepares to return to training in Miami – the Daily Mail examines speculation surrounding his flare-up and names the main suspects.

KIM SEARS:

Face of the defeated: Murray's loss was chronicled by the change in expressions of girlfriend Kim Sears

The story of Murray’s defeat was chronicled blow by blow in the facial expressions of his loyal girlfriend Kim Sears.

Occasionally she appeared to offer advice beyond the standard ‘Come on Andy!’, preferred by much of the Centre Court crowd.

Fact: They didn’t leave together after the match – Andy jumped in an All England Club courtesy car immediately after his post-match press conference and had not changed out of his kit.

Their separate departures would not normally be cause for speculation but Miss Sears did accompany him after his 2012 defeat by Roger Federer – and on Wednesday was said to have been ‘looking upset’ when she left without him.

Wicked internet speculation that she had chosen five minutes before the big match to dump him/tell him she was pregnant/say she had always liked Roger cannot be substantiated. But the breaking news last night was that Miss Sears had accidentally let slip the ending of a box-set TV series they had been watching.

Yesterday his grandfather Roy Erskine, 82, said of the ‘five-minutes’ mystery: ‘Normally he’ll be alone in his dressing room so I have no idea what could possibly have gone wrong.’

AMELIE MAURESMO:

Coach: Miss Mauresmo was seen sprinting up the stairs to the competitors’ box just moments before Murray came on to court

The French former world number one started coaching Murray after he lost in the semi-finals of the French Open last month.

Recently when asked about their professional partnership, she volunteered that things were getting ‘smoother and smoother’ perhaps implying there was a time when they were less so.

Fact: Miss Mauresmo was seen sprinting up the stairs to the competitors’ box just moments before Murray came on to court to face Dimitrov. Did she tell him to change his strategy? Might she have clashed with him over tactics? Was something she said playing on Murray’s brooding mind?

Yesterday a track-suited Murray arrived at her flat near the ground for a pre-arranged meeting. He was carrying what appeared to be a card in an envelope with a single name written on it. Cards declaring ‘Sorry I Told You to Shut The F*** Up’ are not widely available – but in any case, it is Amelie’s 35th birthday tomorrow.

The pair spent more than two hours inside before Andy left alone. But conspiracy theories which suggested coach and player were about to separate amid some unspecified acrimony fell flat when he failed to stomp out in a strop. 

'Off his game': Andy Murray's play was 'not quite right' during their warm-up according to his friend Dimitrov

Enraged: The defending champion also yelled 'shut the f*** up!' at his team according to photographers

Speculation: The 23-year-old Bulgarian (pictured with Murray after his win) said 'it is just a feeling' when he told reporters Andy was not playing to his best ability. The pair are close friends and play together regularly

JUDY MURRAY:

Andy’s mother and long-time former coach remains a constant presence. Except, that is, for some possibly critical minutes on Wednesday at the start of the match.

Fact: Mrs Murray was at court 18 to cheer her other son, Jamie, to victory in his mixed doubles opener with Australian Casey Dellacqua. Little brother Andy had already lost the first set by the time she arrived.

Last week Andy joked he was ‘the number two son’, and that his family seemed to spend a great deal of time watching the number one.

Support: Andy’s mother Judy and long-time former coach remains a constant presence. Except, that is, for some possibly critical minutes on Wednesday at the start of the match

Another theory: Was Mrs Murray shouting advice that contradicted Murray’s coach? Perhaps. But even for a grumpy Scot in a foul mood, it is surely beyond the realms of possibility that he would tell his own mother to ‘shut the f*** up’. Afterwards she stressed she knew of nothing that might have upset him.

MAGGIE MAY:

Roger Federer has entered the debate over Wimbledon’s all-white dress code, saying it is ‘too strict’.

The seven-time champion urged the All England Club to ‘loosen its grip’.

He said: ‘We’re all white. White, white, full-on white … My personal opinion, I think it’s too strict. ‘

Tighter rules were brought in this year amid concerns that sponsors were weaving more colour into players’ kit.

The couple’s beloved border terrier, named after the Rod Stewart hit, has previously used Twitter throughout her master’s Wimbledon appearances. This year she has not tweeted even a bark. Has she been unwell?

Fact: Four years ago Mrs Murray revealed Andy was ‘worried sick’ throughout the tournament after Maggie fell ill.

THE BANANA:

Murray has previously relied on bananas for their energy-giving qualities. Fact: On the advice of a nutritionist, he cut back on bananas last year – and won Wimbledon. This year he admitted he was back on them – and lost.

FATE:

Play began on Centre Court at noon rather than the usual time of 1pm. Murray’s early start led to suggestions afterwards that he he was not mentally prepared for his game. Was he given only five minutes’ notice of the change? Murray dismissed the speculation in his BBC blog yesterday, declaring: ‘There was nothing different in the build-up, and no reason to expect that kind of performance.’

ANDY MURRAY:

Perhaps the player himself is the only real suspect. Could it simply be that he lost? It is the only theory he publicly supports. ‘Yeah,’ said Murray. I certainly lost the match, yeah.’ 

Shock: Dimitrov, who ranks at No13 in the world, was astounded when he secured his place in the semi-finals

The fashions may have changed since their hit duet 45 years ago.

But Cilla Black and Sir Cliff Richard’s devotion to each other clearly has not. The singers have been firm friends since their pop heyday and released the duet Walk On By in 1969.

Yesterday, they arrived at the Royal Box arm-in-arm, laughing and joking as they enjoyed the women’s semi-finals.

They also chatted to Love Actually actor Colin Firth and Inbetweeners star Laura Haddock in the Royal Box. Sir Cliff, of course, is a Wimbledon regular and in 1996 gave an impromptu performance of Singing in the Rain on Centre Court during a long delay in play caused by rain.
