A blind man was twice banned from buying goods in a sports store because his disability meant he was unable to use the chip and pin pad.

Peter Cotterill, who has been blind since he was 10, has vowed to take action against retailer Sports Direct after he was prevented from using his debit card to shop there.

On two occasions the 44-year-old factory worker asked to make his payment by giving his signature, as allowed by his bank.

But he was refused and told he must enter his pin because of 'company policy'.

Refused: Peter Cotterill, who is registered blind and cannot use chip and pin was not allowed to sign for purchases in Sports Direct in the Merseyway shopping centre, Stockport

Mr Cotterill, from New Mills, Derbyshire, initially went to a branch in Stockport to buy a T-shirt for £7.

Despite never experiencing any problems signing for his card before, staff refused to accept it and he was told to pay with cash instead.

Mr Cotterill complained to the company and got a letter of apology which assured him they would re-train their staff accordingly.

But when he went back to buy a T-shirt and a vest for £12, staff again refused to accept his signature - with the manager telling him they 'couldn't accept' his form of payment.

Mr Cotterill who is seeking damages from the company said: 'What they are doing is pure disability discrimination against the blind,

'I have an arrangement with my bank to give my signature on a debit card payment and I never have a problem anywhere else.

'But these people said it was company policy that signatures were not allowed and they needed me to put in my pin number.

'Their attitude made me feel really stupid because there were loads of people behind me in the queue at the shop and they probably thought I don't have any money in the bank.

Mr Cotterill who suffers from a genetic 
condition, said that he has never encountered problems with signing
against a card payment before.

He said: 'In my whole adult life this has never happened in any other shop, but it's happened twice in Sports Direct,

'The
first time they wouldn't accept my card payment, this was in May of 
last year. It was the same thing, they said they couldn't accept my 
signature.

'Sports Direct said they were going to address the matter and give the staff more training, and that it wouldn't happen again.'

No change: Despite receiving a letter of apology from Sports Direct which said staff would receive extra training the incident happened again

In a letter from Sports Direct in September 2010, a manager said: 'Like all other UK retailers we stopped generally accepting sign for cards over two years ago with the introduction of chip and pin.

'We do understand however that there are always going to be some exceptions.

'Following your letter we have instigated further training in the store in respect to till procedures and I'm sure when you return to the store they will be happy to assist.'

However earlier this month Mr Cotterill was again shopping for sports equipment in the Sports Direct and was again refused his standard method of payment.

When he asked to speak to a manager he was told it was company policy and was handed a customer complaints form

Glynis Howard rehabilitation services manager at blind persons charity Henshaws said: 'The issue with a keypad is they are all slightly different because of that it means learning a hundred different keypads.

'I would say Sports Direct is definitely being discriminator. Under the Disability Discrimination Act it should look at ways of making things more accessible.'

A spokesman for RNIB said: 'RNIB believes it is a reasonable adjustment under the Equality Act that stores allow their blind and partially sighted customers the option of using chip and signature.'

Sports Direct, who made a profit of £89.2m last year, were unavailable for comment.
