Atletico Madrid striker Mario Mandzukic has announced his recovery from a broken nose by posting a Twitter image of himself wearing a protective face mask, accompanied by the caption 'I'm back!!!'.

The Croatia centre forward had his nose bent out of shape during Atletico's surprise 3-2 Champions League defeat by Olympiacos on Tuesday, after catching a stray elbow from former Fulham star Pajtim Kasami.

There were fears the 28-year-old could be ruled out for a lengthy spell after requiring surgery, but he has now returned to training - albeit dressed like some futuristic Zoro.

The former Bayern Munich striker's customised mask, which even features his No 9 on the side, means he will be able to return to action sooner than expected. 

'Normally he would be available to play in 15 days but with a mask he could do so in 10,' Atletico doctor Pedro Luis Llopis said. 

Mandzukic has scored two goals in four competitive games since signing for the La Liga champions  for an undisclosed fee in July.

He is expected to miss Saturday's league game at home to Celta Vigo as well as Wednesday's trip to Almeria - but could be back for the Champions League group match against Italian champions Juventus on October 1.
