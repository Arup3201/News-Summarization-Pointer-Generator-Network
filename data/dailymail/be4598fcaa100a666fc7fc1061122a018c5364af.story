They may have escaped a war-torn country to the safety of a refugee camp, but with no money, food or change of clothes, the families of Syria are now fighting a new battle.

Widowed mother-of-eight Samira is one of the hundreds of thousands of 
citizens that has fled to Lebanon, but admits that she now feels she
has swapped one cruel reality for another.

'I am losing hope. I want my final days to come,' she explains as she rocks her young son Mohammed in a fruitless attempt to keep him warm.

Squalid: Samira's children Ahmed, 19, Mohammed, five, and Sami, seven, sit in the small room in which they live, with their mother and five more relatives

'Living
here is worse than in Syria, here we have to keep worrying about every 
detail,' she explains.

With more refugees arriving everyday, the earmarked land is now becoming an overstretched camp of misery with howling winds tearing down tents, snow turning into muddy water and temperatures plummeting into the minuses.

Oxfam and its partner agencies distribute blankets and mattresses, as well as heaters and 
gas oil to help the new arrivals stay warm during the harsh winter, but they are now desperately appealing for more help as there is not enough funds to reach everyone.

Samira has spent eight months in the squalid camp with her five sons - two of her daughters are in Jordan and one daughter stayed in Syria with her husband.

The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said on Monday that the number of Syrian refugees and individuals awaiting registration is 714,118. This includes 5,417 Syrian refugees registered in North Africa.JORDAN: UNHCR has registered 174,831 individuals but as of Wednesday another 49,224 Syrians had been in contact to be registered, raising the total number to 224,055.TURKEY: 163,161 registered in some 15 camps in Turkey.LEBANON: There are 161,067 registered. As of January 29, an additional 71,358 Syrians had asked UNHCR to be registered, bringing the total number to 232,425.

Last week Lebanese President Michel Suleiman urged Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to backs calls for a global conference on helping Beirut cope with refugees fleeing from Syria.IRAQ: 79,469 as of January 28.EGYPT: 14,375 as of January 28.

The 45-year-old's husband died 13 years ago, but she says his loss has never felt more marked than in the recent months.

'If he had been alive he could have 
helped me a lot but since he is not with us all the pressure is on me to
look after everyone. I wish I had died before my husband so that I 
didn’t end up living like this.'

She has made an appointment to 
register with UN High Commissioner for Refugees, but may have to wait up to three months to register
and start receiving any aid.  

Her home is made from one wall of breezeblocks and finished with plastic sheeting and cardboard boxes -  she shares with 12 other people.

The floor is wet and icy cold, outside snow melts into the ground creating icy mud. 

As Samira talks she coughs and unconsciously clutches at her chest which is causing her pain.  

In the last two months, some 
hospitals and clinics in Lebanon's Beqaa valley have reported that the 
number of refugees being treated for respiratory infections and 
pneumonia account for up to 50 per cent of their caseloads; with the 
figure 35 per cent in Tripoli, north Lebanon.

She says that lack of food is the biggest problem which keeps her awake at night, but dignity prevents her from begging.

'We need bread for the children; we 
don’t have any food at all. I plan to try to sell some items to get some
money.

Devastating: Many of the refugees have no food, barely any blankets and is living in squalid conditions

Struggle: With the arrival of winter, plummeting temperatures, and in some places deep snow, thousands of families living in self-made shelters in Lebanon are facing an extremely tough few months without heating, blankets or food

Overstretched: Jalil refugee camp is one of the oldest Palestinian camps in Lebanon, from 1948. There were 3.000 people living there before the refugees started to arrive but they estimate a further 3,500 have arrived since last summer

'My son sold his mobile phone for $14 (£8) so that we could get some 
food but that has finished now and now we have no more food.'

Worn down by the daily grind, at the moment Samira can only see a bleak future for her and her children.

'I
plan to stay in Lebanon for now, I can’t go back to Syria with my 
children whilst there is a war and I don’t have any other solution. I am
losing hope.'

Another mother who longs to return to Syria is 29-year-old Aysha Ahmed.

'It’s very difficult living here. I 
think it’s about dignity. I would prefer to die than to lose my dignity.
This is not a way to live; I would prefer to die in Syria than continue
living in this situation,' she says.

She explains the family are struggling in the bitter temperatures because they are short on clothes after fleeing so unexpectedly.

'I only managed to bring a couple of 
pieces of clothes for each child, just one small nylon bag with 
everything in. Because it was winter and the clothes were heavy it is 
all I could manage to carry,' she explains.

Aysha longs for the happy and 
comfortable life the family enjoyed before the uprising against 
President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011.

She and her husband saved for 12 
years to build their own house after living with his parents, but the last time they saw their home it
had been reduced to rubble.

'In Syria we didn’t have to deprive 
ourselves of anything that we needed. If we wanted something we could 
buy it without a second thought. What we spend here in one day used to 
last us 3 weeks in Syria. The difference in the economy is too high.' 

But she says that when darkness comes that is most difficult time for her young family.

'We
don’t have enough blankets or covers for all of us as there are so many
of us here. It is really a difficult situation because we aren’t able 
to sleep properly.

'You see many things that you don’t 
want to see and you hear many things you don’t want to hear. You are 
forced to accept this situation because there is no other choice,' she says.

The United Nations estimates that 
four million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Syria, 
with over 700,000 refugees now sheltering in neighbouring countries.

In December, it estimated that the 
numbers of Syrian refugees would reach more than 1.1 million by June, 
but it now predicting this figure will be reached much earlier because 
of the rapidly deteriorating security situation.

But there is finally hope for Syria's displaced citizens - donor countries pledged more than $1.5 billion (£949.5 million) of aid U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said today after warning that the conflict had wrought a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.

In a pointed message for Syria's leader, Mr Ban told a fund-raising conference that President Bashar al-Assad bore primary responsibility to stop his country's suffering after nearly two years of conflict that have cost an estimated 60,000 lives.

Mr Ban said the one-day conference had exceeded the target of $1.5 billion in pledges.

About $1 billion (£632 million) is earmarked for Syria's neighbours hosting refugees and $500 million for humanitarian aid to Syrians displaced inside the country.

The $500 million (£315 million) would be channelled through U.N. partner agencies in Syria. and the entire aid pledge would cover the next six months, Mr Ban said.
