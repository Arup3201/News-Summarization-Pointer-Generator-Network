Convicted: James Carroll Butler (pictured) spent time in jail for pouring his urine into a co-worker's personal coffee pot in 2009

A former waste plant employee who poured his own urine into a co-worker's coffee pot has been ordered to pay him $5,001 in damages.

James Carroll Butler, 53, admitted to urinating into a toilet, scooping out the liquid with a soda can and pouring it into Michael Utz's personal coffee pot in March 2009 because of 'personal ill will and spite toward him'.

Following a brief stint in jail, Butler was Monday ordered to pay Utz $1 in compensatory damages and $5,000 in punitive damages for the bizarre crime.

According to The Daily Progress, the men had worked together at the Town of Culpeper waste water plant in Virginia when Butler tainted Utz's drink.

On March 16, 2009, Utz went to make a cup of coffee and 'was hit
 with a strong smell of urine, observing fluid already inside his coffee
 pot that he had not put in there'.

He told his supervisor Eugene Ronnie Brown, who suggested testing the liquid, according to court documents.

Lab
 results revealed that the coffee pot contained urine and fecal 
material.

At a mandatory staff meeting that day, no-one admitted to contaminating the coffee.

But the next day, 
Butler told Brown he spiked the coffee. He also confessed to Daniel Boring, the interim director of 
the town’s environmental services.

'I
 done something I am very much ashamed of to a co-worker for [reasons, 
which are] stress-related [and] things going on in my life on and off 
the job,' Butler wrote in a brief letter dated March 20, 2009.

'I am very much ashamed of my stupid and childlike behavior.'

Butler, who had worked at the plant for 17 years before the incident, deliberately targeted Utz.

Utz had worked as a plant mechanic for the town’s environmental services department since
 2002.

Court records show Butler admitted to Culpeper Town Police Lt. Andrew Terrill that 'he was 
hoping Utz was the person who would get the urine-tainted coffee'.

In May 2009, a general district court 
judge found Butler guilty of criminal misdemeanor assault and sentenced him to a year in jail, before suspending 11 months.

Butler was also ordered to serve one year of unsupervised probation and 
pay $96 in court costs.

Utz also sued Butler, claiming the urine-laced coffee pot caused him severe 
emotional distress. He asked the court to award him $728,000 in civil damages.

On Monday, he was awarded just $5,001, with a jury determining that Butler 'committed battery upon Michael Utz or put him in reasonable fear of receiving bodily harm'.

Utz's attorney Michael Sharman told The Daily Progress his client was 'really, really happy about the victory and he’s glad it’s done'.
