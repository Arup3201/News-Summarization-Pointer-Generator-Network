The mother of a child with Down's syndrome has created a range of baskets filled with gifts and information designed to be given to new parents when their baby is diagnosed with the condition.

Carissa Carroll, a mother of two from Shoreview, Minnesota, came up with the idea as a way to help other parents come to terms with the often intimidating idea of bringing up a child with the disorder.

Mrs Carroll named the packages 'Jack's Baskets' as she thought of the idea around the time of her son's first birthday. Each one comes with a selection of presents for the baby, as well as a welcome letter that congratulates the new parents and gives them practical information on the condition.

Mrs Carroll's baby baskets are intended to bring joy and relief to families at a moment in their lives where they may be experiencing anxiety over the prospect of raising a child with Down's syndrome.

Although each basket costs the Carroll family $60 to make, they have proved so popular that donations have started pouring in. So far there is enough money in the pot to make a further 130 baskets to bring comfort and happiness to families across America.

The letter Mrs Carroll writes to new families reads: 'Hello, my name is Carissa and I would love to be one of the first people to congratulate you on your newest addition to your family. Congratulations! I also want you to know I have also experienced receiving unexpected news.

'My husband and I welcomed our son, Jack, and were told at birth that he was born with an extra chromosome and has Down syndrome. There were moments of confusion, grief of what we thought our lives would be like, and fear. Please know that you are not alone in your feelings,' she adds.

The letter - a version of which appears on Mrs Caroll's blog - Strength for the Climb - goes on to describe the ways in which her son has brought joy into the lives of his family members.

Celebration: Carissa Carroll said her son Jack has made her see life in a 'much more beautiful way'

Speaking of her decision to create Jack's Baskets, Mrs Carroll told ABC News: 'One of the things that helped me so much in those early days were the words of encouragement from parents of kids with Down syndrome that are thriving and wouldn't change their children for the world.'

'I've not met a family that has not been positively affected by their loved one with Down syndrome. But nine out of 10 people have a terrible experience in the hospital' she added. 

'We need to bridge the gap between medical professionals and families,' she went on to say.

As well as her letter of congratulations and information about the U.S. Down Syndrome Diagnosis Network, Mrs Carroll also includes a number of her son's favourite toys in the baskets.

Each one is delivered to the parents without warning, giving them a positive surprise to match the often scary and sudden news that their newborn child has Down's.

Heather Ellis, who received one of Jack's Baskets for her newborn son Dylan earlier this week said: 'It was such a nice surprise to be given this wonderful gift from a family who is raising a son with Down syndrome and could share their story with us.

'With not having any close friends or family members that have kids with Down syndrome, we didn't know what to expect or who we could talk to,' added Ms Ellis, who had no idea that Dylan had the condition until after he was born. 

Down's syndrome occurs when an individual has a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21.

One in every 691 babies is born with Down's syndrome in the United States, where there are more than 400,000 people living with the condition.

Life expectancy for people with Down's syndrome has dramatically increased in recent decades - from 25 in 1983 to 60 today.
