A 27-year-old Minnesota State University student and war veteran shot and killed himself in the campus library Monday afternoon.

Mankato police responded to the Memorial Library at around 4.10pm after getting a report about a suicidal man.

After searching the premises of the library, they found Timothy Lee Anderson on the second floor. He was armed with a gun.

Police say at that point, the 27-year-old junior philosophy major turned the firearm on himself and committed suicide.

A portion of the campus was evacuated and a text message went out at 5.15pm via MSU's emergency alert system informing the community of the deadly incident.

No one else was injured, and police say there was no danger to the public, reported Manktao Times.

Off limits: The library reopened early Monday evening, but the second floor remained blocked off

MSU Student Titi Kawonise, who was working on the second floor of the library Monday afternoon, described to the local paper the moment Anderson was tackled by police, followed by the sound of a gunshot.

'It is so weird to have that happen here in a place that I work,' she said. 'I am kind of freaked out.' 

The library reopened early Monday evening, but the second floor remained blocked off.

MSU officials have made grief counselors available to faculty and students in the aftermath of the tragic incident.

Anderson's friends and family took to Facebook to express their heartache and shock after news of his suicide spread.

'Please pray for my family as we go through the loss of my precious nephew,' aunt Kimbery Anderson wrote. 'God grant us serenity and strength as we all struggle to understand and hold one another up through this.'

Veteran: Anderson (pictured in uniform), 27, served as a gunner in Camp Taji, Iraq, in 2007 

Troubled life: The 27-year-old philosophy major was arrested twice just a month apart on charges of marijuana sale and violation of a protection order 

According to his Facebook page, Anderson was a US Army veteran who served at least one tour of duty in Iraq as a gunner in 2007.

He retired from military service in 2010 and briefly worked for Conservation Corps Minnesota and Iowa.

Online records indicate that Anderson had a criminal record. 

In late December 2013, he was arrested for allegedly selling marijuana.

Less than a month later, the college student was again picked up by police, this time for violating an order of protection in a domestic abuse case.
