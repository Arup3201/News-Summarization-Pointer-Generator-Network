A mother of three today claimed she was told to put on her school uniform and sexually abused as a child by a top British actor.

The woman - who is now aged 39, but was 15 at the time in 1989 - said the TV star even recited the nursery rhyme Ride a Cock Horse to Banbury Cross while they were lying on the floor.

She told police last year and prosecutors said although there was enough evidence to proceed, a legal loophole meant the alleged attacker could only be charged up to a year after the incident.

Abuse claim: The woman is now aged 39 but was 15 at the time of the incident in 1989 (posed by model)

The woman, who lives in the South West and cannot be named for legal reasons, said she met the man in a theatre and he told her how ‘sexy’ she was, shortly before she started at a boarding school.

The man said the school was near his parents’ house and he would take her out. She then called him in October 1989 after starting at the school, and he said it would be ‘nice’ if she wore her uniform.

They met in the local town centre and he allegedly drove her to his home where he gave her wine, before they had sex. He later dropped her back and said ‘see you soon’, she claimed.

The woman, who is a civil servant, told the Sunday Mirror: ‘I can’t remember what we spoke about as we sat in the living room but it was there, on the floor, that we had sex.

Report: The twice-divorced woman told Surrey Police (file picture of one of the force's police stations) about the incident 24 years later, before they handed over the case to the Crown Prosecution Service

‘It happened fairly quickly and I was compliant and just let him get on with it. It was clear he knew what he was after. As we had sex he recited the nursery rhyme.’

'I can’t remember what we spoke about as we sat in the living room but it was there, on the floor, that we had sex'

The twice-divorced woman - who first married aged 18 and has attempted suicide twice - eventually told Surrey Police about the incident 24 years later, before they handed over the case to the Crown Prosecution Service.

The actor denied the allegations when questioned by officers, but the CPS told the woman in a letter that it was ‘entirely satisfied the sexual assault took place as you described’.

However, it added that the charge would have been under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 - and could only have been made against the man if proceedings had started within a year of the allegation.

Decision: She eventually made a complaint when Jimmy Savile was exposed as a predatory paedophile in 2012

The CPS said this law was only relevant to incidents alleged to have taken place before 2004. But if there was sufficient evidence that there was no consent to the act, rape could be prosecuted.

'It happened fairly quickly and I was compliant and just let him get on with it'

The woman met her current partner in 2010 and only revealed the abuse to him two years ago after having to leave the room while they were watching a DVD featuring the actor.

He told her to tell police, but she did not want to at the time. However she eventually made a complaint when the late BBC DJ Jimmy Savile was exposed as a predatory paedophile last year.

She told the Sunday Mirror: ‘What he (the actor) did set the tone around my expectations of men and being used by them. He knew what he was doing and doesn’t care about anybody else.’
