Pablo Hernandez's audacious first-half goal helped Celta Vigo claim a 2-2 draw from a hugely entertaining clash against champions Atletico Madrid at the Vicente Calderon.

Hernandez opened the scoring in the 19th minute when he somehow managed to volley a high hanging ball past Miguel Moya with his heel, but Atletico battled back and were ahead by half-time thanks to goals from centre-back pairing Joao Miranda and Diego Godin.

Celta would not roll over, though, and drew level in the 53rd minute through Nolito's penalty after Carles Planas had been bundled over in the box by Miranda.

Both teams pushed for the win after that but rival goalkeepers Moya and Sergio Alvarez stood firm to ensure their sides remained unbeaten in La Liga.

Elsewhere, former Athletic Bilbao coach Joaquin Caparros enjoyed a happy return to San Mames as he saw his Granada side come away with a 1-0 win thanks to a first-half goal by Jhon Cordoba.

The Colombian forward struck six minutes before half-time, and he and his team-mates then withstood a late wave of pressure to move on to eight points while also remaining unbeaten.
