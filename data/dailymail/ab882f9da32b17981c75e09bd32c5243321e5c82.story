Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

It's just one day until the World Cup, but in Spain and Mundo Deportivo, the attention centres on Victor Valdes.

The former Barcelona keeper's proposed move to Monaco has collapsed due to the player's knee injury suffered in April proving more serious than first thought.

Elsewhere in Spain, Marca are reporting that Sergio Ramos is set for a new bumper contract which would take him behind only Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo as the biggest earners at the European champions - a show of gratitude perhaps for his injury time equaliser in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid.

In Italy, Tuttosport lead with Juventus boss Antonio Conte having made contact with Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez while also claiming Manchester United have made a £56m offer for PSG's Edinson Cavani.

Corriere go with Mario Balotelli's engagement Fanny Neguesha but also report that Tottenham forward Erik Lamela is the subject of a three-way-fight between Juventus, Inter Milan and Napoli to secure his services.

Over in France, domestic issues are set aside as L'Equipe lead with celebratory pictures of the France national team and a headline that roughly translates as permission to dream of winning the World Cup.
