Louis van Gaal prepared for the Barclays Premier League run-in by admitting that he does not have a reliable centre forward.

Manchester United face Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday at the start of a 12-game run that will decide whether they make the Champions League places and whether Van Gaal’s first season at the club can be considered a success.

With United’s defence one of the tightest in the Premier League, Van Gaal knows that goals at the other end could decide his team’s fate and agreed that his centre-forward trio of Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have not reached the required levels this season.

The United manager said: ‘It is true because I cannot deny it, Robin van Persie cannot deny it, Falcao cannot deny it and Rooney is not playing there much any more, but we cannot deny that at this moment we don’t have a striker who scores 20 goals in the season.

‘They could be having an unlucky year and I have to take that into account and I have to decide, with my staff, if it’s these aspects or other aspects that is causing this.’

Despite the injury problems that have caused United so many problems defensively this season, it is the attacking play of Van Gaal’s team that is causing supporters to be concerned.

Currently, they see little of the fluency and excitement traditionally associated with United despite the investment in attacking players made last summer. Falcao is likely to get a chance with Rooney on Saturday, as Van Persie is out for a few weeks with an ankle problem and young James Wilson has a dead leg.

Van Gaal also admitted that he needs to see more from record signing Angel di Maria and conceded that the former Real Madrid player is struggling to adapt to what his manager wants.

‘He needs to go through the process and at the end he shall be much better,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I know that he is a very creative player and you can see this from the statistics.

‘He needs that space and I give him that space, but he needs to do things with his brain and that is a learning process, not only with Di Maria but with all the players. 

'Every team has its philosophy, which is why some players are better with one club but not another. When you buy players you need to give them time to adapt to the culture of England, to the rhythm of the Premier League, because that is a big difference to somewhere like Spain.’

Asked if trying to change the way a player like Di Maria thinks risks damaging him, Van Gaal was unwavering.

‘You have to ask the player that,’ he said. ‘I give a lot of space to all the players because in an attacking way they create more when they are free. 

'But when you want to win as a team you have to defend also and he has to do that. It is not always the fault of the manager when a player is not performing well, I can tell you!’
