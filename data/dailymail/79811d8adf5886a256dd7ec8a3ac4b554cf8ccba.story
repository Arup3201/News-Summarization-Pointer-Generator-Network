A-listers not withstanding, most of us arrive looking dishevelled after a long haul flight. But one group of non-celebrities always look glamorous - the air hostesses.

So how do they do it? This week, Your-hols.com put the question to a group of stewardesses working for Emirates and were told that blusher and a seriously dedicated skincare routine were behind their indestructible make-up looks.

Now the British beauties at BA have revealed some tricks of their own - as well as a few brilliant tips for passengers who want to make it to the end of the flight in style.

Looking good: BA air hostess Rachelle Carter (pictured) relies on Estee Lauder foundation and Carmex

Among the pearls of beauty wisdom offered by crew member Rachelle Carter, 23, are investing in a good primer and wearing an eye mask while you sleep in order to keep your eyeshadow in place,

'Invest in a good foundation,' adds the Hampshire stewardess, who has worked at the airline for five years.

'Estee 
Lauder Double Wear is the perfect foundation and lasts for the full flight, while giving you a clear complexion and boosting your confidence 
without feeling too heavy.'

Other useful tips include staying hydrated during the flight and using hand sanitisers to keep your hands fresh - a trick, she says, that will leave you feeling more alert and invigorated.

Carter also has plenty of purse-friendly beauty suggestions that will appeal to passengers too and recommends using cheap and cheerful Carmex to keep lips in good shape during a long flight.

For passengers looking for ways to stave off boredom and stay gorgeous at the same time, she suggests a mini pedicure courtesy of lashings of bargain foot cream.

'Smother your feet in a layer of moisturiser (I would recommend Aveeno, itâ€™s perfume free and comes in a travel size), then put on a pair of old thick socks (or BA ones),' she advises.

'If you suffer from greasy hair, dry shampoo is an absolute saviour,' she adds. 'You can buy travel size versions now, which will fit perfectly in your handbag and are easy to use just before landing. Batiste is a favourite with cabin crew.'

And if all else fails? Carter admits that even cabin crew can have off days so suggests carrying a good pair of sunglasses to hide the damage.

'If all else fails, make sure you always carry a good lipstick, some sunglasses and a pashmina,' she reveals. 'They will hide all manner of sins as you make your way through the arrivals hall!'

From finding the perfect foundation to banishing bronzer to the back of the bathroom cabinet, here are the tips UAE airline Emirates hands out to its cabin crew:
