After 12 days of carrying a winning lottery ticket worth a staggering $2.7 million in her handbag, a NSW woman has stepped forward to claim her prize.

NSW Lotteries had been searching for the lucky owner of the winning ticket, which was purchased in Wagga Wagga, since the January 3rd draw.

The woman, who wants to remain anonymous, was on holidays when she and her husband bought the ticket at Hunters Newsagency, 68 Fitzmaurice Street.

After 12 days of carrying a winning lottery ticket worth a staggering $2.7 million in her handbag, a NSW woman has stepped forward to claim her prize

'My husband and I had been visiting Wagga Wagga', she said, when she asked her husband to buy a Lotto ticket when he bought a newspaper. 

The woman and her husband will now be able to top up their bank account with $2.72 million, their share of the $30 Million Megadraw.

Belinda McDougall, spokesperson for NSW Lotteries, said that it is not unusual for winners to take a few days to come forward to claim their prize.

'It does happen from time to time that people take several days, or in this case twelve days, to come forward,' Ms McDougall said.

'We always encourage our customers to register their tickets to their players cards, so rather than having to discover that they're a winner, we get to break the news that they've won,' she said.

'It's pretty nice to break the news to people, and it's wonderful for people to come forward like this and start 2015 as a multimillionaire.'

The couple have plans to pay off their mortgage, and the woman said she would consider moving to part time work because of the windfall. 

Apart from paying off their mortgage, the woman said she'll probably now only work part time rather than full time.

In November a Canberra family took a week to claim their  $30 million jackpot after buying the ticket in Woden.

'I was finishing off my Christmas shopping today and saw a sign at the outlet urging customers to check their entries because they'd sold the $30 million winning Oz Lotto ticket,' she told The ABC.

'I thought I'd better check my entry but I never considered that I actually had the winning ticket,' she said.

'I never win anything.'

The family also said they would pay off their mortgage, donate some of their winnings to charity, and were entertaining ideas of flying first-class on their next family holiday.
