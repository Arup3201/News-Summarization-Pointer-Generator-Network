From shopping and driving to enjoying a pint in the local pub, these images show the everyday adventures of a 'family' of Henry vacuum cleaners.

Danny Walker, 28, was bored of vacuuming his home in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, so decided to capture his hoovers engaging in a range of activities.

In the photos, Henry, Hettie, George and two 'baby' hoovers can be seen visiting a park, playing in a ball pool, having a haircut and gazing into a mirror.

In one image, the cleaners are pictured relaxing on the roof of a boat as it cruises down a canal, while another sees Henry lying in bed after a night out.

And one image even depicts Henry and one of the baby vacuum cleaners posing in the aisle of a supermarket, with the younger of the pair taking a particular fancy to a tube of Smarties.

Mr Walker, who later uploaded the photos online, said: 'Cleaning up is boring and I just felt like having a little fun, and a Henry Hoover is a lovable character which lots of people have in their homes. 

'While being bored while vacuuming, I thought "everyone loves Henry Hoover!", so I decided to take him on little adventures and get people wanting to see what he'll end up doing next.'

At the hairdressers: Mr Walker said: 'While being bored while vacuuming, I thought "everyone loves Henry Hoover!", so I decided to take him on little adventures'

Creative father: Mr Walker, who works at a brewery, is pictured posing with Henry, Hetty and the 'baby' vacuum cleaners on the roof of a boat on the canal in Abingdon 

Over the past two years, Mr Walker has spent hours setting up the perfect scenes for the hoovers to pose in, while regularly posting online updates.

And the reaction to the images has been so great that he has even set up a dedicated 'baby Henry' Facebook page, which now has 1,600 likes.  

'I used my own account to post the pictures first of all and the response was mad - I was getting 100 plus likes on each pictures and suddenly everyone in my area was sharing and talking about Baby Henry,' said Mr Walker.

'So I just knew I had to dedicate a whole Facebook page to Baby Henry.'

Mr Walker, who works in a brewery, said that as his photos gained widespread publicity, even local businesses got on board with his idea.

In protective gear: 'I used my own account to post the pictures first of all and the response was mad,' said Mr Walker. Above, Henry in a fluorescent jacket and helmet

Cleaning up: The father of two admitted he often gets strange looks from passersby. Above, Henry and a 'baby' vacuum cleaner remove litter from the side of the canal

Celebration: 'I'm not a massive fan of going around taking pictures of a hoover - people say "here comes hoover boy,' said Mr Walker. Above, Henry on St Patrick's Day

This enabled him to take pictures of the family of hoovers visiting a hair salon, having a massage and going to 'work'.  

But he admitted that he often gets strange looks from passersby while lugging the family of hoovers around the market town.

'I'm not a massive fan of going around taking pictures of a hoover - people would say "here comes hoover boy" and some of the looks I have had in the past were priceless,' he said. 'But the Baby Hoover fans need their daily dose so it's always worth it.'

Mr Walker said his inspiration for for the pictures came from his 'silly sense of humour' and he tries to recreate scenes which everyone can relate to. 

Another occasion: Mr Walker added: 'But the Baby Hoover fans need their daily dose so it's always worth it.' Above, Henry is pictured in a Santa hat at Christmas

Oh no! Mr Walker said: 'It's a fun way to brighten up people's days and I love getting out and about. Above, Henry accidentally puts a 'baby' hoover in the washing machine

'My favourite picture to take was the one in the pub,' he said. 'The pub was full of people drinking, who couldn't believe their eyes when they saw me put the hoovers on the bar stools.

'Every one was having quite a laugh about it- I think some thought the beer had made them see things. People of all ages follow the Baby Hoover adventures but especially children, including my own who love the Baby Henry and Henry Hoover pictures.

'It's a fun way to brighten up people's days and I love getting out and about in my home town, and by the sounds of things people love Baby Henry and his family too.'
