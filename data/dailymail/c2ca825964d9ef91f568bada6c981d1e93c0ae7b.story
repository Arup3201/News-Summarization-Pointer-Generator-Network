Winning an Olympic gold medal is surely one of the happiest moments in any athlete's career.

But when members of Team USA return home from their triumphs in London, they could face an unwelcome surprise - a large tax bill on the value of their winnings.

Now members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have launched a bid to exempt the nation's medallists from having to hand over some of the spoils of their success to the government.

As well as the precious metals which Olympic medals are composed with, each victor receives a cash prize for his or her performance.

Gold medallists are awarded $25,000 by the U.S. Olympic Committee, while silver winners receive $15,000 and bronze $10,000.

This means that athletes could be liable for up to $9,000 in income tax for each gold medal they win.

They could also theoretically pay $200 for the value of the metal in the medal itself - though it is unlikely that the IRS would make that demand.

Several congressmen have now launched attempts to prevent Olympic athletes paying any tax at all on their Games-related earnings.

One of the first proposed bills came from Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican rising star, who argued: 'Our tax code is a complicated and burdensome mess that too often punishes success, and the tax imposed on Olympic medal winners is a classic example of this madness.

'Athletes representing our nation overseas in the Olympics shouldn't have to worry about an extra tax bill waiting for them back home.'

Mr Rubio's measure would exempt 'the value of any prize or award won by the taxpayer in athletic competition in the Olympic Games' from income tax calculations.

On Friday Dave Camp, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, announced that he too would back efforts to allow the athletes to keep their earnings.

'These athletes deserve every bit of our support and appreciation for representing the United States on the world stage,' the Michigan congressman said.

'Allowing our Olympians to receive and enjoy their medals and awards without having to worry about whether they can pay the taxes on their accomplishment is just one small way we can show that support.'

Other members of the House seeking to eliminate tax on Olympic earnings include Republicans Aaron Schock and Mary Bono Mack, and Democrat G.K. Butterfield.

No thanks: Beach volleyball star Todd Rogers says the gesture is unnecessary

Many Team USA champions will doubtless be grateful for Congress' attempts to give them a financial helping hand.

But one athlete, beach volleyball star Todd Rogers, has rejected the offer, saying he thinks well-off sportsmen should have to pay their fare share.

'For me, I make enough that I would say I should get taxed,' said Mr Rogers, a gold medallist in 2008. 'I'm not going to say I wouldn't take it, but I'm just looking at it from a realistic perspective.'
