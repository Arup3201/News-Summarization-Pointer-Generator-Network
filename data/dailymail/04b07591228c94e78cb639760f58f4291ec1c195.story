A group of Premier League footballers have put club rivalries aside to invest their vast wealth  in a new property development business, it has been claimed.

Liverpool players Luis Suarez, Lucas Leiva and Jose Enrique have reportedly partnered with Arsenal midfielders Mikel Arteta and Santi Cazorla to put money into Capital and Centric Investments LLP.

All the footballers are believed to have been appointed directors in the company, which was set up by the Manchester-based Capital and Centric with the aim of purchasing old buildings in the area and developing them into privately rented homes.

The company, which is believed to have a number of other investors alongside the footballers, has already raised £50million, according to The Times.

The money will be now be used predominately to purchase and develop property in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Bristol, with the hope of generating returns of between 8 and 10 per cent a year while creating a £250million property portfolio.

The footballers have each invested different amounts in the scheme and been locked in to the investment for a period thought to be longer than five years, the newspaper reported.

Projects: Capital and Centric is currently developing the former Littlewoods building in Liverpool. In a £4million project, the derelict warehouse will be converted into 18 small office suites

Other than Lucas Leiva, all the 
footballers involved in the scheme speak Spanish as a first language, and
 are thought to have personal relationships with Capital and Centric 
founders Tim Heatley and Adam Higgins.

Capital
 and Centric say they have completed £30 million in speculative 
developments over the last two years, with a further £20million invested 
in properties currently under construction.

One Capital and Centric property currently being developed is the former Littlewoods building in Liverpool.

In a £4million project, the derelict warehouse - which is known locally as 'The Bunker' - will be converted into 18 small office suites for small and medium sized business.

Capital and Centric acquired the building in April 2013 from the Homes & Communities Agency, with work beginning last October.

The footballers' investment in the property business comes after former Manchester United defender Gary Neville started building a property portfolio in in 2011. 

Neville, who became assistant manager of England after his retirement from football, is also believed to have been named as a director for Zerum Consult - a new development, planning and sustainable design consultancy - earlier this year.

Another former footballer, Robbie Fowler, has had such success with property development after retiring from the sport that he started a training centre for new entrepreneurs.

The Robbie Fowler Property Academy claims to help new investors 'build a property portfolio without the need of a footballer's salary'.
