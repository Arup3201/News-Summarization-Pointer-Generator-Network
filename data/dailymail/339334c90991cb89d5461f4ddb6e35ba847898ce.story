It was a fleeting moment of friendship across the battlelines which now stands as testament to the unwavering spirit of human kinship that not even savage warfare could extinguish.

But newly discovered letters sent from the trenches of the Western Front have cast new light on the famous Christmas Day truce of 1914, when the guns of First World War fell silent and sworn enemies put hostilities aside to play a game of football.

The previously unpublished letters sent by Major John Hawksley, of the Royal Field Artillery, to his sister Muriel at her home in Coatham Mundeville, near Darlington, show that not everyone on the frontline agreed with the unofficial ceasefire.

Major Hawksley's letters will be auctioned by Bonhams in London on June 19, where they are expected to sell for Â£4,000.

The
 Christmas Day truce saw more than 100,000 British and German soldiers 
lower their guns and leave the trenches to exchange gifts and play 
football in the mud of No Man's Land.

But, according to Major Hawksley, then 37, at least one regiment refused to take part.

Writing
 from the frontline, the soldier told his sister: 'The Seaforths...would
 have none of it and when the Germans in front of them tried to 
fraternise and leave their trenches, the Seaforths warned them that they
 would shoot.'

He also spoke of his own discomfort 
about the truce and added: 'This is an extraordinary state of things and
 I don't altogether approve of it', although he admitted: 'Still it 
gives me and my observation post a quiet time.'

The first letter sent to Muriel, written on December 27, details the festive camaraderie between the opposing forces.

He
 wrote: 'Christmas day in our immediate front was quite extraordinary. 
After dark our men and the Germans whose trenches were only one to two 
hundred yards apart sang in English Home Sweet Home together.

Soldiers on the Western Front were seen eating a meal to celebrate Christmas Day in a shell hole partly occupied by the grave of a comrade

'Then God Save the King was sung by both. I don't know what words the Germans sang to this tune.

'Then late on a German shouted to the Warwicks - 'We won't fire tomorrow if you don't'. Our men shouted back "All right".

'When it was light on Xmas day, each side showed itself above the trenches.

'First
 head and shoulders then seeing they were not shot at - showed a little 
more - until a German got out of his trench and then an Englishman did.

'Finally about 100 Germans and 60 Englishmen including officers on both sides stepped out and fraternised with each other!'

He wrote that a football match was also arranged for Boxing Day but he discovered that 'our big guns' were due to fire.

'The
 OC [officer commanding] Warwicks warned the German officer that they 
were going to be shelled and that he hoped they would not be hit and all
 went back to their trenches.

'When the shelling began and they saw that they themselves were not to be the targets, they got out again.

'Then a German officer said to one of ours: "Look here we don't want to shoot you and you don't want to shoot us".

'So
 the arrangement between us...is that neither of them shoot and that if 
they have to begin they will fire three volleys over their heads as a 
warning.'

In the second 
letter, written two days later on December 29, he noted that the 
proposed football match in their quadrant was stopped by "our 
authorities", adding: 'I don't think an official armistice has been 
carried out quite so long as in front of me. (Gunfire continues all the 
same).

Rest: Exhausted troops try to recover and catch some sleep in the trenches during a break in the battle in World War I

'Yesterday the Hampshires received [from the Germans] the following message: "Gentlemen. Our automatic pistol has been ordered from the Colonel to begin to fire again at midnight, we take it an honour to award you of this fact". Funny isn't it?'

Hawksley, whose parents lived in Pembrokeshire, was a veteran of Ladysmith and Khartoum and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for services on the retreat from Mons.

He was killed by a sniper in France in 1916 and is buried at Becourt Military Cemetery.

Last year, previously-unseen letter was discovered which described the legendary football match of the Christmas Day truce during the First World War.

The letter was sent by staff sergeant Clement Barker four days after Christmas 1914, when the British and German troops famously emerged from their trenches in peace.

Sgt Barker, from Ipswich, Suffolk, describes how the truce began after a German messenger walked across no man's land on Christmas Eve to broker the temporary ceasefire.

British soldiers then went out and recovered 69 dead comrades and buried them.

Sgt Barker said the impromptu football match soon broke out between the two sides when a ball was kicked out from the British lines into no man's land.

His nephew Rodney Barker, 66, found the letter when he was going through some old documents following his mother's death.Sgt Barker wrote to his brother Montague: '...a messenger come over from the German lines and said that if they did not fire Xmas day, they (the Germans) wouldn't so in the morning (Xmas day).

'A German looked over the trench - no shots - our men did the same, and then a few of our men went out and brought the dead in (69) and buried them and the next thing happened a football kicked out of our Trenches and Germans and English played football.

Family: Rodney Barker, left, found the poignant 
letter, which describes the truce in detail, from his uncle while going 
through documents following the death of his mother

Date: Sgt Barker wrote the letter on December 29, 1914, after the British and German troops had conversed during the truce

'Night came and still no shots. Boxing day the same, and has remained so up to now...'We have conversed with the Germans and they all seem to be very much fed up and heaps of them are deserting.

'Some have given themselves up as prisoners, so things are looking quite rosy.'

His optimistic outlook proved quite wrong, as the truce was the last act of chivalry between the two sides and the war went on for four more years, with the loss of ten million lives.
