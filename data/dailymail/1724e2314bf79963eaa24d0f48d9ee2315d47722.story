A woman who flew from San Jose to Los Angeles without a boarding pass and has made repeated attempts to sneak aboard flights was arrested again Thursday at Los Angeles International Airport after wandering through terminals without an airline ticket, authorities said.

Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, was taken into custody a day after a judge had ordered her to stay away from LAX unless she had a paid ticket, airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said.

Hartman took a morning Flyaway shuttle bus from downtown's Union Station to the airport.

Gannon said he had a feeling Hartman was going to come back to LAX without a valid ticket, so police had passed out fliers with pictures of her to airport police officers and staff.

Busted:
 Hartman has been repeatedly picked up at San Francisco Airport for 
trespassing. She made it onto a plane one time - but was discovered 
before it took off

'She was seen wandering through several terminals today in what appeared to be a scouting mission,' he said.

Hartman was arrested for violating terms of her 24-month probation, which was issued Wednesday after she pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering the city as a stowaway on an aircraft.

When she left court, Hartman said she would never try to sneak onto a plane again.

'It was stupid, and it is something I don't want to repeat,' she said.

It was unclear what charges Hartman could face following Thursday's arrest.

Los Angeles city attorney spokesman Frank Mateljan said officials plan to review the police report while she is in custody.

A call to her attorney, Elsie Wanton, was not immediately returned.

Hartman had recently left mental health treatment that she had been ordered to attend and said homelessness drove her to take 'desperate measures.'

She said she feels safer being in airports than in the streets.

Still smiling: Marilyn Hartman, 62, claimed she would never try to hop a plane again without a ticket - despite at least a half-dozen arrests for it this year alone

On Monday, 
Hartman had tried at least three times to get to a plane before she 
finally went past a security screener who was busy checking a family's 
documents at Mineta San Jose International Airport, according to law 
enforcement officials.

They would speak only on condition of anonymity because the security breach is being investigated.

Hartman then went through the electronic screening process before entering an airport terminal.

Her boarding status was discovered once Southwest Airlines Flight 3785 landed in Los Angeles, the officials said.

Her
 breach of security caused federal officials and the airline to launch 
investigations. It also prompted criticism of San Jose's airport in 
light of the trespassing of a teenage boy who stowed away in the wheel 
well of a Hawaiian Airlines flight and survived the arduous journey to 
Maui.

In
 February, Hartman was sentenced to 18 months' probation in San Mateo 
County after being arrested for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound 
flights at the San Francisco International Airport on three separate 
days.

In
 November 2010, Hartman made it as far as the airport baggage claim on 
the Hawaiian island of Kauai before being arrested, the San Francisco 
Chronicle reported.

Hartman
 told authorities in the past that she wanted to fly somewhere warm 
because she had cancer, said Steve Wagstaffe, district attorney for San 
Mateo County.

Prosecutors in San Francisco has declined to press charges against her after a half-dozen arrests. Authorities say she is mentally ill

Hartman had cancer but has been in remission for several years, the Chronicle reported.

Authorities placed Hartman in treatment for mental disorders in May but said she stopped attending last month.

Wagstaffe said he had no plans to take any additional measures against her.

'She declined all of our efforts to offer her assistance,' Wagstaffe said.

'And we tried all of the alternatives we had because we weren't interested in locking her up on our end.'

After her arrest Monday night, the 62-year-old claimed her plane-hopping days were over - despite seven previous arrests.

After
 pleading no-contest to trespassing charges on Wednesday, Marilyn 
Hartman told reporters that she's sorry she sneaked through a 
Transportation Security Administration checkpoint and that it was a 
'very stupid' thing to do. 

Hartman,
 who authorities say has a history of mental illness, has now been 
arrested nine times for trespassing at airports this year.

Outside the Los Angeles Airport Court on Wednesday, she was cherry, talkative and engaging - despite her dire circumstances.

She was released from jail with the $4.25 in change that she had been carrying and directed to a nearby homeless shelter. 

A
 judge told her to stay away from airports. Court officials told her she
 could take a bus back to San Francisco. She's hopeful she can easily 
panhandle enough cash for a ticket.

'I think I've been on enough programs where people can recognize me. They might give me a dollar or two,' she told KNBC-TV. 

She
 said Wednesday that homelessness drove her to take 'desperate 
measures,' and that she feels safer being in airports than in the 
streets. 

Wagstaffe said Wednesday that 
Hartman has no family and was never married.

According to her blog, 
found by the San Francisco Chronicle, she has lived in sketchy motels and squalid apartments from Seattle to San Diego in the last few years.

She claims she was fired from her job as a legal secretary after she reported her boss for corruption. 

Records
 indicate Hartman was arrested November 6, 2010, at the Lihue Airport in
 Kauai after trespassing into the baggage claim area, the Chronicle 
reported. She was charged with simple trespass, but failed to show up 
for court hearings - and remains the subject of a bench warrant.

According
 to the newspaper, Hartman said in her blog that she had successfully 
hopped a plane once before. She was found out and detained - but later 
released without charge.  

In
 May - after being arrested seven times at San Francisco International 
Airport - Hartman was placed in a mental treatment program but she 
stopped attending last month.

Then
 she went back to the San Francisco airport, but Wagstaffe's office 
declined to file charges after her seventh arrest in July for another 
failed attempt. 

On
 Monday, Hartman was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles 
International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained 
on board for the final destination to Phoenix. 

She was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department.

Hartman's
 antics - which previously targeted San Francisco International Airport -
 have made her something of a folk hero in the Bay Area.

On her first attempt, on February 15, she sneaked through TSA security and boarded a plane bound for Hawaii. She managed to take a seat on the flight - but was caught when the passenger who paid for a ticket in the seat showed up. 

She told police at the time that she had cancer - a claim that has not been substantiated - and that she wanted to go someplace warm.

A Go Fund Me page set up by sympathetic San Franciscans has raised nearly $1,300 toward sending her legally on a Hawaiian vacation.

The San Jose Mercury News reports that Hartman sneaked past the TSA agents check boarding passes while a family was being screened on Monday night. She had tried three times to get past the checkpoint unsuccessfully before she made it through.

She then got into the security line and was screened for weapons like all other passengers.

Once in the terminal, she tried unsuccessfully to board several planes before she was able to get aboard the Southwest Flight to Los Angeles.

Southwest, unlike many other major airlines, does not have assigned seats - which could explain how she wasn't discovered until the plane landed at LAX. 

This is the second high-profile security breach at Mineta San Jose International Airport this year. In April, a 15-year-old boy scaled a fence and sneaked into the wheel-well of a Maui-bound plane. Incredibly, he survived the freezing temperatures for five-and-a-half hours and landed safely in Hawaii.
