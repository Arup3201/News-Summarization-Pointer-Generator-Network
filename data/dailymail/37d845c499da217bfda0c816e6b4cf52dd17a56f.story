A district attorney resigned on Tuesday from prosecuting a racketeering case involving the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas just days after a fellow Texas lawmaker and his wife were assassinated.

Mike 
McLelland, Kaufman County District Attorney, and his wife Cynthia were shot dead at their home close to Forney, Texas last Saturday.

Assistant DA Jay Hileman sent a short email to the defense team today saying that he was stepping down for security reasons.

Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow on Saturday

He is being replaced by another
Department of Justice prosecutor from Washington D.C. who will 
travel to Houston to join the high-profile case.

That individual will join attorney 
David Karpel from the DOJ's gang unit in prosecuting 
the large racketeering case, according to Dallasnews.com.

The Aryan Brotherhood, a violent white supremacist prison gang, is suspected of 
being behind the assassinations. However no evidence has tied the 
gang to the slayings and no one has been arrested.

Mr and Mrs McLelland were murdered less than two weeks after Colorado's prison 
chief was shot to death on his doorstep, allegedly by an ex-convict.

And on January 31, Kaufman
County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse was shot dead in a 
courthouse parking lot in Houston. No arrests have been made for his
killing.

The killings have sent ripples of fear through the Texas legal community with many prosecutors increasing their security details.

Harris County District Attorney Mike Anderson now has round-the-clock protection for him and his family after the assassinations. His district includes Houston.

His spokeswoman toldÂ The Houston Chronicle:
'This danger is present every day. They put bad people behind bars 
everyday, and prosecutors and investigators carry this with them every 
day.

'It's sad, it's 
tragic. It weighs heavy on Mike, but it's not going to let it stop him, 
or anyone in this office, from doing their job.'

Law enforcement agencies throughout Texas have been on high alert, and steps were being taken to better protect other DAs and their staffs.

Anderson said he also would take precautions at his office, the largest of its kind in Texas, with more than 270 prosecutors.

'I think district attorneys across Texas are still in a state of shock,' Anderson said on Sunday.

Mr McLelland, 63, was the 13th prosecutor
killed in the U.S. since the 1960s.

Kaufman
County Sheriff David Byrnes would not give details on Sunday of how the 
killings unfolded and said there was nothing to indicate for certain 
whether the murders were connected to Mr Hasse's shooting.

In Colorado, sheriff's spokesman Sergeant Joe Roybal said 
investigators had so far found no evidence connecting the Texas killings
to the Colorado case, but added: 'We're examining all possibilities.'

Colorado's
corrections director Tom Clements was killed on March 19 when he 
answered the doorbell at his home outside Colorado Springs.

Evan
Spencer Ebel, a white supremacist and former Colorado inmate suspected 
of shooting Clements, died in a shootout with Texas deputies two days 
later about 100 miles from Kaufman.

In an interview shortly after the Colorado slaying, Mr McLelland raised the possibility that Mr Hasse was gunned down by a white supremacist gang.

McLelland, elected in 2010, said his office had prosecuted several cases against such gangs, particularly one known as the Aryan Brotherhood.

The groups have a strong presence around Kaufman County, a mostly rural area dotted with subdivisions, with a population of about 104,000.

After Hasse's slaying, Mr McLelland said that he carried a gun everywhere around town even when walking his dog.

He figured assassins were more likely to try to attack him outside. He said he had warned all his employees to be constantly on the alert.

'The people in my line of work are going to have to get better at it,' he said of dealing with the danger, 'because they're going to need it more in the future.'

The number of attacks on prosecutors, judges and senior law enforcement officers in the U.S. has spiked in the past three years, according to Glenn McGovern, an investigator with the Santa Clara County, California district attorney's office who tracks such cases.

For about a month after Mr Hasse's slaying, sheriff's deputies were parked in the district attorney's driveway, said Sam Rosander, a neighbor of the McLellands.

The FBI and the Texas Rangers joined the investigation into the McLellands' deaths.
