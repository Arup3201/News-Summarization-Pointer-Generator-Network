High-stakes slot machines where gamblers can place bets of up to £100 are a form of 'onanism' compared to the 'full sexual intercourse' of betting on horses, a Labour peer has claimed.

Lord Lipsey mocked users of so-called Fixed Odds Betting Terminals as 'sad-eyed blokes' who sit in front of 'porn-like' machines while 'shoving in pounds for momentary pleasure'.

The extraordinary remarks came in a House of Lords debate on banning the machines, and sparked claims from a minister that he was turning the subject into 'Fifty Shades of Betting Shops'.

The spread of the machines has sparked alarm among campaigners who warn they are fuelling problem gambling and anti-social behaviour. There are thought to be more than 30,000 FOBT machines in the UK.

The machines, which feature games such as roulette, blackjack and poker, have a maximum payout of up to £500.

Users can bet up to £100 every 20 seconds and in 2013, some £1.6 billion was lost by gamblers on FOBTs in Britain.

In a debate in the Lords, several peers called for a crackdown on their use including capping the amount users can bet.

But in his speech Lord Lipsey launched into what he described as a 'rather racy analogy' to describe how he is 'not very fond' of the gambling machines.

'If betting on a horse race is the full sexual intercourse of betting and gambling, with foreplay when you select your horse and mounting excitement as the race goes on - we know what happens after that, when the result comes - then FOBTs are a form of onanism.

'You see sad-eyed blokes - it is always blokes - in front of porn-like machines, made very glittery and unrealistic, shoving in pounds for momentary pleasure.'

He went on: 'If FOBTs evaporated into the air tomorrow, I for one should be delighted but that does not mean that I would ban them.

'There are a lot of pastimes that I do not much like: fox hunting, shooting and fishing.

'However, if others wish to practise them within the law - and of course on fox hunting there is a strict law - that is their affair.'

Tory frontbencher Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth later joked his 'contribution seemed to turn into 'Fifty Shades of Betting Shops'.

Councils are among those calling for tough new powers to tackle 'clustering' of betting shops and reduce the risks from FOBTs which have been dubbed the 'crack cocaine' of gambling.

They say the current £100-a-spin maximum stake should be brought in line with maximum stakes for other gambling machines, which is £2 in pubs and £5 in casinos.

Lord Lipsey insisted that everything must be done to 'stop the terrible affliction that genuine addictive problem gambling can do to people and their families'.

He added: 'As far as I am concerned, it is not those who shove every penny they can get hold of into these damned machines who are the only people with a gambling problem.

'Anyone who stuffs a hard-earned £100 into a slot has a gambling problem. You therefore have to tackle it across the board.'
