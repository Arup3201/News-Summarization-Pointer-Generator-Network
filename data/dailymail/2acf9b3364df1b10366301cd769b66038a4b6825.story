A couple died on Wednesday morning after their cars collided in a head-on crash near where they worked in Texas.

Cristina Muniz, 26, and Nicholas Cruz, 31, worked at an egg farm near the scene of the crash, but because of shift patterns they often took two cars.

The couple, who had three young children, were pronounced dead at the scene after Muniz drifted across the road and hit her husband's truck at the crest of a hill.

Loss: Cristina Muniz, who had three children with Cruz, also died in the crash near the farm where they worked

The force of the crash was so great that emergency services had to use specialist equipment to cut the couple from the wreckage. Neither had been wearing seat belts.

Police are still investigating what led to the crash, on a narrow road that had no markings.

'It appears speed and the layout of the road, including a hill crest, are going to be factors in the cause of the accident,' Trooper Jymie Ha told the Times Record News.

At the time of the crash, the couple had been driving between two separate buildings owned by their employer, Mahard Egg Farm.

Muniz, 26, and Cruz, 31, had two sons and a daughter, and were married in April last year.

They were both originally from Mexico, but had been raising their family in Chillicothe, Texas. Muniz had also attended Prosper High School.
