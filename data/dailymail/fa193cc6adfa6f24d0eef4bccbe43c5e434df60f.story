They belong to one of the most elite spy organisations in the world.

But it appears that members of America's U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) are just like the rest of us and like to complain about what is being served in their office cafeteria.

Thanks to a revealing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request in the U.S., the dodgy attitude of the Burger King employees and lack of a 'dollar menu' are laid bare at the CIA.

CIA headquarters: One of the world's most elite spy organisations has a serious problems with its staff cafeteria

Aerial view of the CIA: The top secret agency has world issues and a disastrous beef stroganaff to deal with

Attitude stinks: One CIA employee was fed up of dealing with rude staff just to get a burger at Burger King

Employees lay into the organisation for not providing individual sachets of Tomato Ketchup and mustard which is 'causing frustration to many employees.'

Other pressing requests for America's most feared agency, is a jazz salad that failed to deliver grapes - when grapes were clearly advertised as being a part of the lunch time snack.

And in another hilarious complaint, one employee laments the stale bread that he received in his Subway sandwich, which forced him to have to eat the inside of it only as the outside was 'crunchy.'

One more disgruntled member of staff throws a fit over the iced tea being replaced by 'processed tea which he quite rightly argues 'tastes terrible as does most processed tea.'

Bad tea: As America's most trusted organisation why was the iced tea replaced with terrible processed tea?

Cheated: One employee complained about the lack of a dollar menu at the CIA to save money on lunch

Condiments trouble: This operative wants his ketchup back in individual sachets as he cannot use a pump box

Great carrots: This patron was really happy about the carrots in the hot bar

The CIA, known for its rigorous training and top secret operations across the world, cannot, it appears deliver a decent Russian beef stroganaff - which one employee branded too American.

He wrote:Â 'Please realize that many of us have really traveled to these countries and when you provide food like you did today, it causes me to not support this kind of cuisine in the future. I feel that for example Beef Stroganoff is more American than Russian.'

And if you're looking for a decent regular Pepsi at the CIA, forget about it. One of its members revealed that a covert operation had clearly taken place to replace regular Pepsi with diet Pepsi.

Wrong Pepsi: A covert operation had clearly taken place to replace regular Pepsi with diet Pepsi

Complaints: Members of the CIA have lodged a series of complaints about their below par cafeteria

The illuminating e-mails were uncovered by investigative journalism group Muckrock.

It had the documents sitting undiscovered in its archive until Ben Emmel, an assistant at the University of Wisconsin's DesignLab, tweeted about them late last week.

The tweet prompted MuckRock to highlight the documents it received from the CIA in March 2011 and also a follow-up request for more cafeteria complaints that it received in 2013.

You can't fool the CIA: This man has spotted that the Russian beef stroganaff was far too American

Gluten: The CIA does not value labels on food but has slowly begun to put labels on its gluten free food, however, more needs to be done says this employee

Chicken issues: Don't ever try to pass off a quarter of chicken as anything else at the CIA

Jazz salad: This jazz salad failed to deliver grapes - when grapes were clearly advertised as being a part of the lunch time snack

However, it wasn't all bad, one agent 
praised the lovely carrots in the hot bar.

And another was appreciative of the salads and wrote: 'Hi - the pre-made salads in 
the cafeterias are very good, but this new one, Southwestern Chicken 
Caesar chop salad was EXCELLENT. thanks!.'

Praise: This agent was appreciative of the salads - especially the Southwestern chicken Caesar chop salad - which was excellent
