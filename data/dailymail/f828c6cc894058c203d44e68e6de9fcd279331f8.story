Just days ago Stephen Sutton bravely told the world he was on the brink of death, and thanked well-wishers for helping him raise more than £1million for charity.

But the teenage cancer patient’s achievement was only the beginning. He has sparked one of the most extraordinary fundraising drives the country has ever seen.

In the four days since he posted his heartbreaking message on Tuesday donations have poured in at an astonishing rate of more than £400,000 a day.

Stephen said last night: 'The tumours in my body are still rife, but I feel so lucky to just still be here'

Stephen Sutton, 19, has raised more than £2million since posting this 'thumbs up' from his hospital bed

On Wednesday Stephen’s plight had prompted donations of £1.4million – an amazing achievement considering the former school athlete had set out to raise a modest £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust charity.

Last night the total had soared to just under £2.5m with contributions from more than 96,000 supporters.

It prompted Stephen, 19, to gather the strength to write a Facebook message from his hospital bed to thank his supporters.

He said: ‘Hi guys, it’s Stephen here again, and it feels so good to be able to put that. Currently I am feeling well and would describe my current situation as stable.

‘Different people will put my recent physical improvement down to different reasons; I don’t want to over dramatise things too much, but I do just want to mention that everyone’s positive thoughts and support has been hugely appreciated, so thank you for that.

‘The tumours in my body are still rife and dangerous, but I feel so lucky to just still be here, and in fact I feel completely privileged to be in this position where I can help make such a difference to other people’s lives.

‘The main thing I’ve always felt passionately about is helping others... I’ve always been a firm believer that people are “good”, and to see people come together for the cause recently in the way they have is incredibly touching and heartwarming.

‘Thank you from me, and also thank you from every young cancer patient in the future who will benefit invaluably from the money raised!’

He added: ‘I always describe my cancer as a huge kick up the backside that taught me a lot of good: the importance of helping others, of making every second count, of making sure life is for LIVING, amongst other things.’

Stephen, of Burntwood, Staffordshire, was diagnosed with bowel cancer when he was 15.

After he realised he did not have long to live, he set himself a ‘bucket list’ of 46 challenges to tick off in his final days, including a charity skydive, quizzes, a football match and playing the drums in front of a huge crowd.

Stephen managed to tick off  33 goals, the first of which was raising £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

But his plight so captured the hearts of those who followed his Facebook, Twitter and other internet updates that he used the growing goodwill to continue fundraising.

Stephen’s ever-increasing fund is the single largest donation  the Teenage Cancer Trust has ever received.

Siobhan Dunn, the charity’s chief executive, said: ‘I’ve had the privilege of meeting him and his positivity is always remembered by all who meet him or hear him speak.

‘Stephen is making the biggest possible difference to Teenage Cancer Trust and the young people who need our help.’

In a post on Thursday Stephen revealed how he had bounced back after suffering a collapsed lung, adding with characteristic fearlessness: ‘In all honesty I was probably not too far from nearly leaving you all.’

He said: ‘One doctor while seeing me even said how my   medical notes and how I was actually doing didn’t quite seem to match up.

‘The progress since has continued to be good but steady. I am still in a very vulnerable position. I am very limited in what I can do and am still permanently hooked up to oxygen.’

Stephen was healthy and active before he was stricken with colorectal cancer, competing at county level in athletics and cross-country running, and playing for Walsall FC’s youth team. His burning ambition was to become a doctor.
