It was a dying request of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill that there should always be a marmalade cat called Jock living a 'comfortable' life at his former home.

But yesterday, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the war hero's death, it emerged that the latest incumbent is banned from large parts of Chartwell in Kent because of his claws.

Curators are concerned Jock IV could do 'untold damage to irreplaceable objects' in the dining room, study and bedroom  – where the original cat would have once had free rein.

'It is purely because of his claws,' said Katherine Barnett the curator of an exhibition at Chartwell, where Churchill lived for 40 years.

The original marmalade tom was given to Churchill on his 88th birthday by Sir John 'Jock' Colville, one of his private secretaries, and the wartime leader named him after his friend. 

He ensured the cat lived a life of luxury and it was so spoilt that family meals would not start until Jock had taken his place on the dining table.

Jock is even reported to have been on the wartime prime minister's bed when he died in London in January 1965.

His beloved animal passed away nine years later and is now buried in the pet cemetery at Chartwell.

Churchill and his family left instructions that the subsequent Jocks should be the same as the original - ginger, with a white bib and paws.

The National Trust, which was left the property by the Churchill family in 1966, has always honoured the request and welcomed Jock VI, a seven-month-old rescue kitten, in March this year.

Jock VI, or Malley as he was previously known, was rescued by Croydon Animal Samaritans before being adopted by Chartwell house.

He is said to enjoy eating tuna, taking afternoon naps and lounging on Persian rugs - but is not so keen on bright lights, being left alone or listening to opera. 

The primary role of a Chartwell cat is to interact with visitors and roam the estate's extensive grounds, according to the National Trust. 

Churchill's affection and patience for cats was clearly visible to those around him during his time at Chartwell, according to Fred Glueckstein, writing for The Churchill Centre.

Speaking at the 1987 International Churchill conference, his secretary Grace Hamblin said: 'He loved cats. He always had a cat, if not two.'

The primary role of a Chartwell cat is to interact with visitors and roam the estate's extensive grounds, according to the National Trust.

The trust says the 'job' involves:

And the role would suit cats that are:

Ms Hamblin recalled that the politician had once greeted one of the house's cats with 'Good morning' - before shooing the animal away with some papers when the cat remained silent and still.

He later asked her to put a card in the window saying 'if Cat cares to come home, all is forgiven'.

She added: 'Cat did come home several days later with a wire round his neck. Given cream and the best salmon and so on.'

Churchill adopted a number of cats during his leadership - two of which were a large tabby named Mickey and a marmalade tom called Tango.

During one amusing incident, the prime
 minister was reportedly speaking on the telephone to the Lord 
Chancellor when Mickey started playing with the telephone cord.

Churchill
 shouted 'Get off the line, you fool!' - before realizing his mistake 
and turning back to the Lord Chancellor, saying: 'Not you!' 

Britain marked the 50th anniversary of Churchill's death today. He was the prime minister through the war years of 1940 to 1945, and again in peacetime from 1951 to 1955.

Prime Minister David Cameron led tributes, describing Churchill as the country's 'greatest ever prime minister' in a video tribute in which he called on people to share their favourite Churchill quotations on social media.

'Churchill was our greatest ever prime minister and we owe him everything. In May 1940 that crucial decision to fight on against Hitler saved our country and arguably saved the world.'

'I think this year we should also all remember the many great things that he said.'

Cameron quoted from Churchill's 'we shall never surrender' speech.

'My favourite quotation from Churchill is the one he made shortly after that momentous decision in May 1940: 'We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.

'We shall fight them on the beaches, we shall fight them on the landing grounds, we shall fight them on the streets and in our fields, we shall fight them in the hills. We shall never surrender'.'
