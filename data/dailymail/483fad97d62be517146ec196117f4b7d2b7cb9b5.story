Mad Men star Kiernan Shipka has opened up about all things style and Sally Draper, revealing that she was incredibly sad to leave the iconic character behind after so many years.

Kiernan was speaking in the April issue of Marie Claire magazine, which was published just in time for her critically acclaimed AMC show's final season, due to premiere on Sunday, May 5.

The 15-year-old admitted that she is sad to see the series go - and to say goodbye to a character she'd like to know in real life, too.

It's been five months since the tragic passing of Oscar de la Renta, yet his legacy lives on. The famed designer's last collection before his death was a true testament to his talent and the understated ladylike glamour that became his signature style.

The range included laser cut lace, feathers, and florals as well as several buffalo checked pieces like the sweater Kiernan Shipka wears in the latest issue of Marie Claire magazine. The cashmere top was paired with an embellished Marc Jacobs dress and a Chanel brooch.

As the temperature rises, we'll be digging out our crop tops and sleeveless shirts, but knits will still be in full force this season. We'd team this number with an A-line skirt, strappy sandals, and a mini satchel for a look that aims to please.

Get the ODLR sweater at My Theresa at the link to the right. Top it with the cutout dress in the edit below to steal Kiernan's style. Or try one of the other printed pullovers that are a lot easier on the wallet starting at just $40.

'It was bittersweet - a really good time, but very sad,' she said of her last day on set. 'Lots of tears.'

While she will no doubt miss her co-stars Jon Hamm, who plays her dad Don Draper, and January Jones, who plays her mom Betty Francis, on set, Kiernan is especially sorry to leave her own on-screen alter-ego behind.

'Sally is very strong and independent. Very perceptive too.' she said. 'I don't think she'd want to be friends with me, but I'd love to be friends with her!' 

Family drama: The show has followed Sally Draper's personal story more as the character has gotten older, giving Kiernan increasing screen time over the course of the whole show

Growing up in the spotlight: Viewers have watched Kiernan grow from a little girl, seen here in 2009, into a teenager

She even takes getting mistaken for Sally in real life as a compliment; the actress says many fans will tell her they hate her parents or want to give  Kiernan - meaning Sally, her oft-emotionally-neglected character - a hug.

But while on-screen Kiernan is meticulously dressed in vintage-style clothing by Mad Men costume designer Janie Bryant - who the actress describes as 'so brilliant' - off-screen the star likes to experiment with clothes and accessories on her own.

She describes her personal style as 'fun and simple,' but will switch out her everyday overalls and sneakers for glamorous designer dresses and heels on the red carpet. 

Designer darling: The actress wore a Miu Miu dress, shoes and bag to a party celebrating the final seven episodes of Made Men on March 25

'I really, really love Miu Miu. It’s so fun and youthful,' Kiernan, who regularly attends A-list fashion industry events, said of one of her favorite designers.

Luckily, the actress will still have plenty of occasions to dress up for the red carpet even after the last seven episodes of Mad Men end this spring, with several more projects on the horizon.

Later this year, Kiernan will star in Fan Girl with Meg Ryan and February alongside Emma Roberts.
