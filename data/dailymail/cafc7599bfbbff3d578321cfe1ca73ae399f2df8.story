Southampton boss Ronald Koeman was frustrated with his side's defensive lapses after the Saints crashed to a 2-1 defeat by Manchester United on Monday night.

Robin van Persie's double meant Louis van Gaal's men took all three points from their trip to St Mary's.

But Koeman seemed to have recovered by Tuesday, wearing his Christmas jumper before the Saints' festive bash and tweeting: Ready for the Christmas party at @SouthamptonFC I believe in the way we played.'

Koeman's men dominated the match against United for large parts but some costly defensive lapses handed the visitors the game with the Saints crashing to their third defeat in just over a week.

'We did everything, we created chances. But we also made mistakes,' said the Dutchman.

'Maybe they [United] made more mistakes than we did but they have players who handle those kind of mistakes and that was the difference today.

'At this level detail makes the difference in football. You can talk about who deserved it, who played offensively, who pressed, but everything is s*** because we lost.

'I said to my players, we did not lose against Man United tonight; we lost by ourselves.'

Koeman remained upbeat despite his side's recent slump in form and insisted that his team would continue with their playing style that has yielded such positive results thus far.

Despite three consecutive losses to Manchester City, Arsenal and United, Southampton hold o nto fifth place in the Premier League table, and Koeman believes there is still grounds for optimism heading into the Christmas period.

'I like to see my team playing football in the way that we've started this season,' he added.

'If we lose or we win, that's our way of playing because I believe in that way of playing even now when we've lost the last three games.

'(Manchester) City were the much better team but we deserved more against Arsenal, we deserve much more tonight but we made mistakes.

'If you give players like Van Persie those kind of mistakes, he will punish you, for sure.'
