Do you feel friskier come summer? If so, you aren't alone according to new research which revealed that infidelity peaks during June, July and August.

The findings were part of a new study conducted by Bank of Italy research fellow Effrosyni Adamopoulou which investigated whether or not commonly held beliefs about infidelity were true.

Among those debunked was the perception that beautiful people are more likely to be cheats - a claim, according to Adamopoulou, that isn't borne out by the evidence.

Feeling frisky? According to new research, infidelity - among both sexes - peaks in the summer months

Adamopoulou came to her conclusions after combing through data sourced from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a rolling experiment following a sample group of young American adults.

Begun in 1994, researchers periodically contact the sample group to question them about their approach to health, relationships and sex.

Among the questions posed to the group is: 'During the time you and your current partner have had a sexual relationship, have you ever had any other sexual partners?', which forms the basis of Adamopoulou's findings.

According to the most recent data (from 2008), 21.5 per cent of participants admitted to cheating on their partner, although that dropped to 12.9 per cent among those who were married.

Risk factor: Travel provides more chances to cheat but couples with children are less likely to be unfaithful

Based on her studies, Adamopoulou concluded that while men and women were equally likely to cheat, the chance of infidelity was less among couples who had children or were religious.

More surprising was her discovery that ethnic origin appears to play a part, with black men more likely to be unfaithful than white.

By contrast, class, earning power and education were all found to have no impact on whether or not people cheat.

Instead, the summer months offer the greatest risk for couples, thanks to increased opportunities for travel - and consequently, increased opportunities to cheat.

'Cheating is less likely to be detected when an individual chooses partners in different places,' she explained in her report, which was first published in journal Economic Letters, before adding:

'There
 does not seem to be any relationship between socioeconomic status and 
infidelity. Earnings and education do not seem to have any
 statistically significant effect [on infidelity].'
