An 84-year-old baseball lover who holds the world record for 'Most Durable Batboy' has celebrated a staggering 55 years on the field for a university team.

Stan 'The Man' Bronson, Jr. first took to the field for the Tigers at the University of Memphis in 1958 and has been going strong ever since - earning campus renown and the moniker of 'living legend'.

Bronson, who has a learning difficulty and a speech impediment, took up the honorary, unpaid role after he was fired from a job at the athletic department at Rhodes College in Memphis.

His mother took him to the University of Memphis and they spoke with the football coach, Billy 'Spook' Murphy, NPR reported.

Living legend: Stan Bronson Jr. has been the batboy for the University of Memphis Tigers for 55 years

'Coach Murphy said, "Well, son, I'm 
sorry but I don't have money in my budget to pay for anybody else." And 
Stan said, "Don't need money. Need a job",' Bob Winn, associate athletic director, said.

His first job with the university involved picking up footballs as team members practiced on the sidelines, and he worked as an equipment manager for the football team until he was in his 60s.

Since 1958, he has also served as the team's batboy - the person who carries the bat to the team and lays out equipment for the game - and has become a stalwart on the field.

He was awarded the title of 'most durable batboy' by the Guinness World Records at a ceremony in May 2007 and featured in the 2008 record book. The game's announcer, Jeff Brightwell, calls him a 'living legend'.

Even when the Tigers are losing, many
spectators stick around to watch Bronson carry out a famed tradition of
tipping his hat at the end of the seventh inning in recognition of the 
fans who have come out to support the team that day.

'You
always want to see Stan come out and tip his cap,' Brightwell told NPR.
'He is probably one of the most recognizable figures... Everyone knows 
and loves Stan.'

Students 
have praised Bronson across the team's Facebook page, while other fans 
are known to give him rides or take him to dinner.

'He's
an icon of this institution,' Eddie Cantler, a former Memphis athletic 
trainer, said. 'Stan is everything that is innocent and pure.'

Record holder: Bronson won the Guinness World Record for 'most durable batboy' in May 2007

Going strong: The university now unofficially oversees care of Bronson, who has a learning difficulty

Staying: Even though he is now 84, Bronson has no plans to leave the role at the university, where he lives

And even though he's reached a staggering 55 years on the field, he's not giving up just yet.

Bronson is in fine health for his age and takes no medication. He now lives in an independent living community overlooking the campus, has a lifetime pass to the school cafeteria and the university unofficially oversees his care.

The school does have concerns about his medical needs in the future and has thrown fundraisers for costs that he may later need to pay off. But he has no need for the money just yet.

'We think, really, quite frankly, that athletics has kept Stan alive and going,' Winn said.

Loved: Every game he tips his hat and takes a bow at the end of the seventh inning to thank the fans
