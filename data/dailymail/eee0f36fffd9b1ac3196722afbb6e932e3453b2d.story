Cruel: Lynda Williams has testified how she was 'creeped out' after snipping a baby's spine

A woman who worked at a Philadelphia 
abortion clinic has testified how she was told snipping babies' spines after they were born was 'standard procedure' to bring about 'fetal demise'.

Lynda Williams, 44, said  her former boss Dr. Kermit Gosnell taught her how to turn a baby over and cut its neck with a pair of scissors - but she only did it once because it gave her 'the creeps'.

As she testified in the murder trial against Gosnell, she added that patients were often given pain medication that did not work during procedures, and that he would slap their legs if they squirmed.

Gosnell,
 72, is charged with murdering seven babies at Philadelphia Women's 
Medical Society and with the death of a woman, who suffered cardiac 
arrest after she was given too much anesthesia.

He performed illegal, late-term 
abortions and when the babies were born alive, he would sever their 
spinal cords to kill them, prosecutors have claimed over the four-week 
trial.

Williams herself has pleaded guilty to two counts of third-degree murder to escape a possible death penalty or life sentence. She admitted to cutting the spine of one baby and 
administering the anesthesia in November, 2009 when patient
 Karnamaya Mongar went into cardiac arrest.

On Tuesday, she testified that she 
Gosnell taught her to snip the babies' necks, a practice she carried out
 once when he was away from the clinic.

She
 said she took a baby that had been delivered in a toilet in the second 
trimester - between 12 and 24 weeks of pregnancy - and saw its arm move before she snipped its spine, The Delaware News Journal reported.

'I only do what I’m told to do,' she told the jury. 'What I was told to do was snip their neck.'

When
 Gosnell returned, she told him about how the newborn moved and he said 
it was simply an 'involuntary response', insisting the baby was already 
dead because of drugs the mother had taken.

She
 said it was the only time she snipped a spine because it gave her 'the 
creeps' and she insisted she did not know it was murder.

'Victim': Karnamaya Mongar, 41, died at Gosnell's clinic during an abortion procedure in November 2009

Murder? Some former employees at the Women's Medical Society, said many women came to the clinic for abortions but looked as if they were too far along in their pregnancies to be there

She added it was one of her duties to pick up babies that women would spontaneously give birth to in the waiting room after getting large doses of drugs, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

Like many of Gosnell's employees, Williams was desperate for work when he gave her a job.

She had a poor education and had not even finished eighth grade, although went on to work as an instrument sterilizer. During this job, she met Gosnell who performed abortions at the clinic.

But
 her life began spiralling out of control when her husband was murdered 
in 2008 and she was diagnosed with bipolar and depression. She asked 
Gosnell if he had any work for her.

He hired her to sterilize instrument and soon asked her to carry out ultrasounds, administering intravenous medication and anesthesia to patients.

She
 told the jury that Gosnell changed paperwork on patients
 that were too heavily pregnant to undergo an abortion so that they appeared to be less than 24 weeks - the legal time limit.

She
 added that pain medication was sometimes out of date or did not work - 
and she would see Gosnell 'smack' the legs of women who squirmed, 
leaving his hand print behind.

Her testimony comes a day after another worker, Sherry West, told the court how she was once handed an underdeveloped newborn with no eyes or mouth and told to deal with it.

Other employees have described how they saw about 100 babies born alive and then 'snipped'.

Some told the court of gruesome 
scenes at the clinic which was allegedly found dirty and rundown with 
rusting surgical instruments.

Rundown: An internal shot of the clinic, which was allegedly reeking of animal urine and feces

A Grand Jury report said the clinic was
 crawling with cats and reeking of animal urine and feces. Furniture and
 blankets were stained with blood and instruments were not properly 
sterilized.

Disturbingly, the report alleged that fetal remains were stuffed 
into: 'cabinets, in the basement, in a freezer, in jars and bags and 
plastic jugs'.

'It
 would rain fetuses. Fetuses and blood all over the place. It is 
literally a beheading. It is separating the brain from the body,' one former employee Stephen Massof told NBC.

But he said he believed the 
intentions of his boss were honest and that the doctor believed he was helping the 
women, often extremely poor, who came to him

The doctor: Kermit Gosnell

Charged: Pearl Gosnell

Employee: Elizabeth Hampton

Arrested: Tina Baldwin

Assistant: Sherry West

Worker: Adrine Moton

Accomplice: Eileen O'Neil

Locked up: Stephen Massof

Held: Maddline Joe

'I believe that Dr. Gosnell was honestly trying to help women and protect them from abuse and neglect,' Massof said.

The trial is in its fourth week and is expected to last another month. If Gosnell is found guilty he could be given the death penalty. 

Eight clinic employees have pleaded guilty to various charges, while a ninth is on trial with Gosnell. 

Gosnell's lawyer denies the murder charge and disputes that any 
babies were born alive. He also challenges the gestational age of the 
aborted fetuses, calling them inexact estimates.
