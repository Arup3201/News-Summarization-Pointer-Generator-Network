Plot: Kelvin Melton 'ordered the killing of the dad of the prosecutor who locked him up for life'

An imprisoned gangster used a smuggled cell phone to mastermind the terrifying kidnap of the father of a prosecutor who helped send him away for life, federal authorities said.

Frank Arthur Janssen, a North Carolina military contractor whose daughter prosecutes violent crimes, was rescued in a raid on an Atlanta apartment by the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team on Wednesday night.

Authorities arrested five people - aged between 19 and 21 - who allegedly have connections to the Bloods gang. They were acting on behalf of Kelvin Melton, who is serving a life sentence for 
ordering the shooting of a man in 2011, said John Strong, the FBI's 
agent in charge for North Carolina.

During the abduction, the kidnappers took a picture of Janssen tied up in a chair and sent it to his wife, threatening to torture and dismember him if she went to police, the FBI said in court documents.

They also allegedly exchanged at least 123 calls and text messages with Melton in the past week as they discussed how to kill and bury 63-year-old Janssen without a trace.

The suspects were found nearly five days after the kidnapping after authorities tracked their mobile phones and listened to their calls.

Authorities are now investigating how Melton, 49, got a mobile phone in his cell at Polk Correctional Institution in Butner. Smuggled phones usually come from relatives or other visitors, AP reported.

Plot: Frank Arthur Janssen, 63, right, was 
kidnapped earlier this month allegedly by five gang members who wanted 
to get back at his daughter, who prosecuted on a case that put their 
friend behind bars

Testimony from his 2012 trial shows 
Melton is a high-ranking member of the Bloods street gang from New York 
City who ordered a 21-year-old subordinate to travel to Raleigh and kill
 his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend.

Court
 records show Melton has a long record of felony convictions in New 
York, the first being a 1979 robbery committed when he was 14.

The
 admitted triggerman, Jamil Herring Gressett, testified that he followed
 Melton's orders for fear he or his loved ones would be killed if he 
didn't. The victim survived a gunshot wound.

The
 prosecutor in the case was Wake County Assistant District Attorney 
Colleen Janssen - kidnapping victim Frank Janssen's daughter.

In a handwritten 2012 letter in the court file, Melton protested that the prosecutor had not followed proper legal procedure, citing a specific state statute.

Authorities have revealed text messages sent by the alleged gang members to the kidnap victim's wife, as well as details of a call between the gang and their mastermind, Kelvin Melton.

Texts from the 'gang' to Christie Janssen

If you contact police, 'we will send (Mr. 
Janssen) back to you in 6 boxes and every chance we get we will take 
someone in your family to Italy and torture them and kill them... we 
will do drive by and gun down anybody.'

At 12.19am Wednesday, she 
received a text photograph of him tied up in a chair.

'Tomorrow we call you again an if you can not tell me where my 
things are at tomorrow i will start torchering.'

Call between 'gang' and 'mastermind'

At
 8.20pm on Wednesday, Melton called the kidnappers and they apparently spoke about where to bury Janssen's body:

'The first spot we are checking out is close to the house.'

'We want to make sure it's in a secluded area and the ground is soft so we can go 3 feet deep.'

'Get a bag, put it over his head, and stuff something in his mouth.'

'However you feel like doing it, just do it.'

'Make sure to clean the area up. Don't leave anything. Don't leave any DNA behind.'

'Prosecutor must file accuser affidavit with clerk of court 'prior' to seeking an indictment, this affidavit must be on file, mandatory!' Melton wrote. 'The accused indictment is not legal and is rendered in-valid.'

But it didn't work and Melton was 
convicted of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and being a
 habitual felon, resulting in a life sentence.

The
 case came back to haunt the Jenssen family when a woman knocked on 
Frank Janssen's door on Saturday at his Wake Forest home. Several people
 assaulted him and someone used a stun gun.

He
 was then driven 400 miles away to Atlanta and his wife, Christie, 
returned home from a shopping trip to find him gone from the home and 
drops of what appeared to be blood on the ground.

On Monday, Christie started receiving a series of text messages from a mobile phone in Georgia.

One
 of the texts said if law enforcement was contacted, 'we will send (Mr. 
Janssen) back to you in 6 boxes and every chance we get we will take 
someone in your family to Italy and torture them and kill them... we 
will do drive by and gun down anybody.'

At 12.19am Wednesday, Janssen's wife 
received a text photograph of him tied up in a chair along with a 
message: 'Tomorrow we call you again an if you can not tell me where my 
things are at tomorrow i will start torchering.'

The messages made specific demands 
for the benefit of Melton, according to the FBI. Those demands were not 
spelled out in the court filings and authorities would not provide 
further details.

A 
federal law enforcement source told the Associated Press that the 
kidnapping was an act of retaliation and that the communications of 
those involved suggested a link to the Bloods.

The next morning: The agents raided the apartment around midnight and five people were arrested

Cruel: The five kidnappers allegedly tied up Janssen and sent a photo to his wife to blackmail her

Probe: FBI agents can be seen gathering evidence from the scene following the successful rescue

At 8:20 p.m on Wednesday, the FBI says a call was placed by Melton from the prison to a phone associated with the kidnappers in Atlanta. The two male callers appear to be discussing how to dispose of a body:

'The first spot we are checking out is close to the house.'

'We want to make sure it's in a secluded area and the ground is soft so we can go 3 feet deep.'

'Get a bag, put it over his head, and stuff something in his mouth.'

'However you feel like doing it, just do it.'

'Make sure to clean the area up. Don't leave anything. Don't leave any DNA behind.'

Following
 the call, authorities tried to enter Melton's cell and he temporarily 
barred the door and smashed the phone. A few hours later, they located 
Janssen in Atlanta at the Forest Cove Apartments.

Charged with kidnapping were: Jenna Paulin Martin; Tiana Maynard; Jevante 'Flame' Price; Michael 'Hot' Montreal Gooden and Clifton James Roberts. Authorities also recovered a .45-caliber handgun, picks and a shovel, according to the FBI.

According to the complaint, the women and Roberts conspired to kidnap Janssen while Price and Gooden were the 'night watch' over him.

Those arrested appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Atlanta on Thursday. They are due back in court for a bond hearing Tuesday, when they will each have a lawyer appointed by the judge.

According to prison records, Melton is being held on 'maximum control' status after racking up several infractions over the past year, including being cited for possessing a weapon and twice for having a mobile phone.

In 2013, 747 mobile phones were confiscated from inmates in North Carolina's prisons. So far this year, 166 have been seized.

Authorities: John Strong, special agent in charge of the FBI in North Carolina, said the kidnapping was related to his daughter's prosecution work as he spoke at a press conference on Thursday

Officials at the state Department of Public Safety concede many are smuggled in by prison employees bribed by inmates or their relatives. They are now investigating how Melton got the phone he allegedly used to help orchestrate the kidnapping of his prosecutor's father.

'The department is deeply concerned about any corrupting influence by inmates against Adult Correction employees and will aggressively investigate and take action against offenders and staff involved in using cellphones to conduct criminal activity from inside prison walls,' Secretary Frank L. Perry said.

'It will continue its ongoing efforts with increased intensity toward stopping contraband from entering any of its facilities.'
