At just eight weeks old, tiny Willow Turner was fighting for her life with a rare liver condition.

And just six months later, her parents were given the heartbreaking news that she would die if she didn’t get a transplant.

But after battling from the brink of death several times, and thanks to her uncle Tarron Thomas who donated part of his liver, she is now thriving.

Willow Turner was fighting for her life with a rare liver condition until her uncle, Tarron Thomas, donated part of his liver to her

Willow and Mr Thomas will end up having full-sized livers due to the organ's remarkable ability to regenerate itself.

Both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor's liver are able to regrow into a normal-sized liver.

Willow's mother, Becky Leather, 24, said: 'Willow would not have survived without a new liver.

'Everything she does is down to Tarron, I can’t thank him enough. I don’t think she would be here now if it wasn’t for him.

'From being at the hospital all that time, it’s wonderful to be home as a family. It’s nice to see Willow playing - I never thought that would happen.'

Mr Thomas, who is Ms Leathers' 
brother, said: 'I didn’t think twice when I heard they were looking for 
family members as potential donors.

'I wasn’t nervous beforehand - I 
think my mum and Becky were more nervous than me, I was just thinking 
about Willow. I think I will hold it over her when she’s older and she’s
 being naughty, mind!'

Willow had biliary atresia - a rare liver disease which affects one in 16,000 newborns

The type of transplant Willow had is called a living donor liver transplant.

This is where a section of liver is removed from a living donor – because the liver can regenerate itself.

This means both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor's liver are able to regrow into a normal-sized liver.

Within six weeks of donating part of his liver, Mr Thomas's liver had grown back to its original size.

Willow was born after a normal pregnancy on June 22, 2012.

'When she came out she was perfect and everything was normal at first,' said Ms Leather, who lives with partner Marc Turner, 39, in Skelton, North Yorkshire.

'She was a bit jaundiced and her eyes were yellow, but we were told it was nothing to worry about.

'At eight weeks old she was weighed and they said she shouldn’t still be yellow, so we were told to take her to hospital.'

Medics at Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital ran a series of blood tests.

The family was then told the devastating
 news that Willow had biliary atresia - a rare liver disease which 
affects one in 16,000 newborns.

She was rushed to Leeds General 
Infirmary and underwent a nine-and-a-half hour operation as surgeons 
tried to reconstruct the tract by which bile is secreted by the liver.

Mother-of-six Ms Leather said: 'She went down at midday and I saw her again at 9.30pm.

Last summer MR Thomas underwent his operation at St James¿ University Hospital in Leeds - 20 minutes away from Leeds General Infirmary where Willow was operated on

'It was horrendous - my tiny eight-week-old baby had a massive scar across her belly and a big breathing tube.'

Willow stayed in hospital for two weeks before she was allowed home, but sadly the procedure did not work.

'At eight months old, she was only 12lbs, she was absolutely tiny,' says Ms Leather. 'She had a feeding tube but nothing worked.'

Doctors then decided she needed to go on the transplant list. Several members of her family put themselves forward to see if they were suitable donors and in May 2013, Mr Thomas was confirmed as a match.

He underwent his op at St James’ University Hospital in Leeds - 20 minutes away from Leeds General Infirmary where Willow was operated on.

The 23-year-old donated part of his liver and spent five days in hospital recovering.

Despite
 having to have eight weeks off work, Tarron has not had any 
long-lasting side-effects, as the liver re-grows within six weeks.

But although his operation went well, Willow - who underwent 11 and a half hours of surgery - was rushed back into theatre after a blood clot was detected.

After another two weeks in hospital, Willow was finally allowed home.

Willow, who is on five types of medication including anti-rejection drugs and steroids, now has to have regular check-ups.

And though she is small for her age and has some development delays, the 20-month-old is on the mend - although there is always chance she will reject her new liver.

Despite this worry, her mother said: 'She only weighs 16lbs and can’t walk yet, but she is so happy and smiley, she hardly ever cries.

She added: 'The medical team at Leeds were absolutely brilliant. I couldn’t fault them.'
