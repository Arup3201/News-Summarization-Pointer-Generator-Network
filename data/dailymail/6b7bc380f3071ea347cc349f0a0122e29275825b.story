The driver of an 18-wheel tractor-trailer that collided with a bus and killed four members of a Texas community college softball team told investigators he had been distracted by something in his cabin before the accident, authorities said Sunday.

The truck was northbound on Interstate 35 near Davis, Oklahoma Friday night when it veered across the median and smashed into the bus carrying 15 members of the North Central Texas College women's softball team and driven by their coach.

The truck, driven by Russell Staley, 53, of Saginaw, Texas, continued off the interstate. Staley was treated for injuries and released. There were no charges pending against him.

'He (Staley) said he was distracted by something in the cabin,' said Oklahoma Highway Patrol Captain Ronnie Hampton, who declined to say what the distraction was. 

He said that investigators do not necessarily agree with Staley's explanation. The Highway Patrol will eventually turn over the results of its investigation to the local district attorney, who will decide whether to pursue criminal charges.

Hampton also said investigators had obtained search warrants to collect evidence from both the truck and the bus. 

Teammates Jaiden Pelton, 20, Katelynn Woodlee, 18, Brooke Deckard, 20, and Meagan Richardson, 19, have been identified as the teammates killed in the devastating crash.

Captain Ronnie Hampton said: 'What we do know is that the semi [truck] was headed north on I-35 when he departed the roadway and entered the southbound lanes.

He told The Oklahoman. 'When it impacted the bus, it just kept going and went off the side of road. ... We knew we had a two-vehicle accident by what we saw at the scene. ... But it took about an hour before we found the semi.'

Hampton said: 'Right now, it's being investigated like a homicide.'
