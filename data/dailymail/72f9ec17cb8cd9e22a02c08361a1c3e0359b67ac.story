If you're an Alessandro, Lorenzo or Romeo, your name alone may just be enough to sweep someone off their feet.

And the same goes for Scarlett, Nicolette, Natalia, Anaïs and Paulina, who have all been voted as having the world's sexiest names in a five year study.

Bobs, Gertrudes, Berthas and Normans, however, have less luck when it comes to convincing people of their passionate side, according to the research. 

Actors Alessandro Nivola (left) and Scarlett Johansson (right) have the sexiest names, according to a recent study. The results were collated by Laura Wattenberg, founder of BabyNameWizard.com

The results were collated by Laura Wattenberg, founder of New York-based BabyNameWizard.com who asked tens of thousands of visitors to rate names for sexiness.

The top 10 contenders for boys' and girls' names shared a number of characteristics that inspired feelings of sensuality and passion, Wattenberg wrote in her blog.

Many of the male names end in 'O,' and many of the female names end in 'a.' Female names, such as Nicolette and Alessandra, also have double.

'Italian names make a strong showing on the girls' list, but French comes to the fore as well,' said Wattenberg.

'The French girls' choices add a saucy flavor, with the flouncy diminutive Nicolette and the literarily erotic Anaïs.'

Wattenberg said that exotic names also have an element of fantasy, which is why they are often chosen for perfumes or lingerie brands.

Literature also has an impact on how we view names with Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' inspiring the top 10 list for boys.

Rhett and Scarlett, meanwhile, can be found in the pages of Margaret Mitchell's 'Gone with the Wind.'

'One thing that leaps out at you is that we do have a mostly American and English-speaking user base, and Americans still have the image of the Latin lover,' Wattenberg told Live Science.

'These names are Italian and Spanish and French. You can even go Russian, with Dmitri.'

The name Bob is common compared to the names on the 'sexy' list and so many people many not consider it to be exciting or romantic, Wattenberg said.

The least sexy girls' names are largely old-fashioned, with double consonants in the middle, as in Gertrude and Mildred.

The site that conducted the study doesn't collect demographic data on the users, but includes users worldwide.

If you're a Mildred or a Howard, there is still hope.

'Sexiness isn't a universal positive in a name,' wrote Wattenburg. 'Every name style comes with trade-offs, and what sounds good on a lingerie label may not serve as well for a salesperson or aspiring politician.'

These results are based on ratings from Namipedia visitors, the majority of whom are female.

'It's certainly possible that an all-male panel would choose differently,' said Wattenburg.

'Yet the girls' style, including Italian and French names and double letters, does line up with a style heavily favoured by the adult entertainment industry for targeting male customers.

'As for male names designed to appeal to a gay male audience, one 2005 study found a proponderance of simple boy-next-door stage names like Tom and Mark.'
