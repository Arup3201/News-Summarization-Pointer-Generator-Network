When a fan decided to start an online conversation with JK Rowling about the weekend’s Scotland v Italy rugby match, he was stunned to get a reply.

Now the Italian is boxing up a jar of Nutella to send to the Harry Potter author following a wager over which country would win.

Andrea Brutto tweeted the writer on Saturday, ahead of the Six Nations clash at Murrayfield in Edinburgh, saying: ‘I’m Italian and I can’t wait for this match. Watch what we can do!’

Before the game, the Harry Potter author made a bet with an Italian rugby fan on Twitter saying she would send him a signed book if Scotland won. If Italy won he had to send her a jar of Nutella 

To his surprise, Miss Rowling, who lives in Edinburgh, replied: ‘Are you going to be at Murrayfield?’

Her overseas admirer was almost lost for words, saying: ‘I don’t know what to write you cause I don’t understand. Oh my God! Thank you Jo.’

The author then promised to send him a signed book if Scotland won ‘to ease the pain’ – but asked: ‘What will you give me if Italy win?’

He replied: ‘I cannot compare a signed book with one of my gift… But I think a simple but stronger hug or a kiss or a Nutella.’

Miss Rowling agreed, saying: ‘OK, Italy wins, you have to send me some Nutella. Scotland wins, you get a signed book.’

The Italian players celebrate after winning 22-19 in the game, meaning that the author lost the bet with Mr Brutto 

After the match, Miss Rowling tweeted the Italian rugby fan congratulating his side on victory and reminding him he still owed her a jar of Nutella 

Eventually Mr Brutto replied by posting a picture of the chocolate spread and asking for the author's address so he could send it to her 

After a penalty try in the 80th minute gave Italy a 22-19 win over Scotland, she tweeted: ‘At least I’ll have Nutella. Congrats Andrea, you can have the book anyway. I need a very large drink. X’

Mr Brutto posted a picture of the jar of the chocolate spread that will soon be heading to Scotland.

The 49-year-old writer also tweeted her support for Madonna, following the star’s fall at the Brits last week. 

Miss Rowling wrote: ‘Are you the sort of person who gloats when they see a woman fall, or the kind that celebrates a magnificent recovery? #TeamMadonna’

The delighted singer retweeted her famous fan’s support, before saying: ‘Thank you J.K Rowling! So nice to read your words of support! Women supporting Women! Hell to the Yeah!’
