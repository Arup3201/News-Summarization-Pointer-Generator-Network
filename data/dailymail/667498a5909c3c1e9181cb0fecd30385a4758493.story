Dangerous teeth-whitening products are being sold to unsuspecting customers on the internet.

The scale of the problem was laid bare last night when Trading Standards officers revealed they seized illegal whitening kits worth more than £500,000 from a house in London.

The medical-grade treatments are being sold with nearly 60 times the legal level of bleaching agent hydrogen peroxide.

The illegal gels, which promise to whiten teeth in just seven days, are being marketed as a cheap alternative to professional whitening services.

However, dentists say they can lead to mouth blisters and irritated, extremely sensitive gums.

Trading Standards officers in Hillingdon, west London have seized 12,000 teeth-whitening kits worth in excess of £500,000 amid fears the products could cause painful blisters to the mouth and gums because of high levels of hydrogen peroxide

Teeth-whitening has become increasingly popular as more Britons seek the Hollywood smile sported by celebrities.

But with professional whitening costing up to £700, some are tempted by cheaper kits offered online. As a result, fraudsters have moved in on the business – with some selling pirated kits turned out in overseas factories using substandard and even risky ingredients.

The latest batch of seized products, found in a house in Hillingdon, West London, contained 5.9 per cent hydrogen peroxide, meaning they could only be legally supplied to dental practitioners. 

Without the proper medical training, a higher dosage of hydrogen peroxide than is safe can easily end up being applied and lead to teeth and gum damage.

According to European law, teeth-whitening products are only safe to be sold directly to customers if they contain a maximum of 0.1 per cent hydrogen peroxide.

Uxbridge Magistrates' Court has now issued a court order for the 12,000 seized kits to be destroyed. Hillingdon Council said they belonged to a Polish national called Piotr Kaszubski, who has since fled the country.

A spokesman said: 'Trading Standards officers uncovered evidence that the goods were being supplied online to consumers with inadequate checks being made. Mr Kaszubski has returned to Poland and stated that he was merely an agent for an American company, so it was decided to seek forfeiture of the products worth in excess of £500,000.'

Checks by the Mail indicate that some of the products, which go by the branding Whitetime Dental Expert, were still being sold online last night.

According to one website: 'You do not have to spend hundreds for professional teeth whitening. Whitetime is the answer.' Hillingdon councillor Jonathan Bianco said: 'Products like this should only be used under the supervision of a qualified dental practitioner.

The kits were seized from a residential property in Sipson, near Heathrow. Experts warn the strong bleaching gels, which are 5.9 per cent hydrogen peroxide, should only be handled by a dental practitioner (file image)

'We always put our residents first and our trading standards team work hard to identify and seize dangerous products, and prosecute when possible.'

Last month the General Dental Council secured its first prosecution of someone illegally training others to carry out teeth-whitening. Martyn Collier, a beauty trainer from Monmouthshire, was fined £11,490 for illegally training beauticians in the service. Only dentists are permitted to carry out teeth-whitening in Britain.

Nicolas Martin, professor of restorative dentistry at the University of Sheffield, said that hydrogen peroxide is dangerous if not applied by a medical professional. 'If a dentist does not regulate their use, there is a risk of harm,' he said.

'There is a further risk that unregulated products used by individuals without professional supervision may be more caustic and/or toxic and potentially cause severe and dangerous injuries.'
