Phillip Clayton claims his 86-year-old mother Maureen, a retired teacher, died in agony, covered in pressure sores, after nurses failed to turn her in her hospital bed for 11 weeks

An 86-year-old woman died covered in 'horrendous' pressure sores after nurses failed to turn her in her hospital bed, her son claims.

Phillip Clayton said his mother died in 'pain and tears' and contracted MRSA as a result of the care she received.

He claims a delay in fitting a pacemaker also contributed to his mother's death after she was admitted to hospital with a dangerously low heart rate.

He has launched a complaint against Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent after his mother Maureen died in November. 

NICE guidelines advise adults at high risk should be turned at least once every four hours to prevent pressure ulcers.

The hospital is now carrying out a review into her care.

Mr Clayton, 56, a public sector worker, said: 'The fact that my mother died is unfortunate.

'The way she died in pain and tears from the pressure sores is a disgrace and in my view, totally unacceptable. 

'It is wrong to say my mother would not have died but I do think the care she received shortened her life.

'It was not the right way for her to die. The way she spent her last few weeks was shocking.

'The real problem is a total lack of leadership which permeates right down to ward level and results in an appalling level of service.

'I do not need apologies or a formal investigation, what I would like to see is change.'

Mrs Clayton, a retired teacher, was admitted to the hospital on September 13 after a fall at her home in Rainham, Kent.

Her heart rate was low and she spent three days on a cardiac unit before being diagnosed with liver problems and transferred to the Will Adams ward.

Mr Clayton claims while there staff failed to turn her during her entire 11 week stay - when it should have been done once every four hours.

He added that they only rearranged the pillows under her back which did not prevent her from contracting painful pressure sores.

Three weeks into her stay she was diagnosed with MRSA and died on November 27 from renal failure.

Mr Clayton added: 'They simply rearranged the pillows underneath her. Turning a patient in bed is not rocket science. It is a basic nursing skill.

'There was a long delay before she was fitted with a temporary pacemaker and then a permanent one. During this time she deteriorated.

'If she had been fitted with the pacemaker in the first week and been able to get up, maybe things would have been different.'

A spokesperson from Medway NHS Foundation Trust, who run the hospital where Mrs Clayton was treated said: 'The Trust takes concerns around care very seriously and is currently carrying out a review, as discussed with the family.

'The outcome of the review and the actions we are taking as a result of the findings, will be shared with the family.'
