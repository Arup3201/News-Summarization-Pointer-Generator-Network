Bill Cosby wasn't mocked by Eddie Murphy on Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary show because Murphy refused to play the role. Now the embattled star wants his fellow comic to know he's thankful for the support.

'I am very appreciative of Eddie and I applaud his actions,' Cosby said through his spokesman Thursday.

Eddie Murphy said he made his decision because 'he didn't want to kick a man when he's down'.

Murphy, making his return to SNL for the first time in 30 years, had been asked by writers to play Cosby, who is facing a string of allegations of sexually assaulting several women during the height of his fame.

Saturday Night Live writer Norm MacDonald told his 507,000 followers on Twitter that he wanted Murphy to play Cosby in a sketch on the anniversary show.

According to MacDonald: 'The iconic doors would open and on to home base would step Eddie Murphy. The audience would know what to do. 

'Why is Eddie wearing a multi-colored sweater? He steps behind the bar, begins mixing a drink. The audience covers the fact he has not spoken. 

'When he speaks, he is Cosby. Eddie Murphy doing a perfect Cosby impression. The audience does not let him finish. The sketch ends.' 

But Murphy said he was uncomfortable playing Cosby. 

According to MacDonald, he hoped Murphy would step in and play Cosby until the show was about to go live.

Already that night, the producers were fretting that Bill Murray was not going to take part in the show as he was playing golf. Murray subsequently appeared in a sketch singing the Jaws theme tune.

MacDonald said: 'We talk in his dressing room a good hour. When it's over, I'm convinced he'll do it. He doesn't. 

'He knew the laughs would bring the house down. Eddie Murphy knows what will work on SNL better than anyone. 

'He decides the laughs are not worth it. He will not kick a man when he is down. 

'Eddie Murphy, I realise, is not like the rest of us. Eddie does not need the laughs.'

Murphy appeared on stage for just one minute and 25 seconds after his refusal to perform the Cosby sketch, which appeared during a spoof edition of Celebrity Jeopardy.

Current SNL star Kenan Thompson played Cosby instead of Murphy and appeared during a spoof edition of Celebrity Jeopardy.

In the sketch, Thompson is seen wearing a bright sweater, similar to the type worn for many years by Cosby and holding a cocktail shaker.

Several of the women who claim they were abused by Cosby believe he may have drugged them.

Within seconds of appearing on screen, Will Ferrell, who played Jeopardy host Alex Trebek, apologises to the audience, claiming the Cosby insert had been 'filmed in June' - before the most recent allegations were made public.
