A mother has been arrested for running around her Arizona home naked and bleeding after her live-in boyfriend refused to have sex with her.

Ashley Prenovost allegedly ran around her Glendale, Arizona house just past midnight in the early hours of Monday morning screaming at her boyfriend when he denied her sex.

The 24-year-old mom was said to be extremely intoxicated when her boyfriend- whose name has not been released- arrived home and promptly demanded that they have sex.

Rampage: Ashley Prenovost, 24, has been charged with assault and endangering her child after attacking her live-in boyfriend, waking up their daughter and knocking her into a dresser during the rampage

Prenovost went on to wake up their 4-month-old daughter, who is identified as 'victim 2' in the police report, and run around and put the child in potential danger.

In the mood: The mother was apparently 'extremely intoxicated' when her boyfriend arrived home late Sunday night and wanted to have sex with him but he refused

'Suspect picked up victim 2 and began running around inside residence, yelling and screaming and during this time, causing victim 2 to hit her head on a dresser in the master bedroom,' according to the police report which was found by The Smoking Gun.

She proceeded to turn violent, punching walls and glass before her hands started to bleed.

'Suspect then punched 2 holes in the wall of victim 2's bedroom and then punched a picture hanging on the wall in the hallway, causing glass to break and causing injuries to both of suspect's hands,' the police report states.

'While suspect was running around inside residence, she bled all over the floor in the master bedroom, hallway, common airea by the front door and kitchen.

'Upon officer arrival, suspect could be heard yelling inside residence and was still naked.

'Suspect then attempted to flee residence through the garage and began yelling and screaming when detained.'

Prenovost refused to answer questions at the police station when she was taken there in the very early hours of Monday morning.

Scene: She left a trail of blood throughout their Glendale, Arizona house after punching two walls and a framed picture during the incident

Together: Her boyfriend has not been named but she posted two pictures of herself with the same man in June of last year, when she would have been in her second trimester while pregnant with the daughter she had with her boyfriend

She has been arrested on charges of suspicion of child and adult abuse, aggressive assault on a minor, endangerment, assault with intent to injure, criminal damage and disorderly conduct.

She was released from custody on Tuesday- the day after her arrest- and has a court date scheduled for February 24.

Her boyfriend's name has not been released, but her Facebook profile has two pictures of her- which were taken last summer when she would have been in her second trimester of her pregnancy- posing with a man that may be 'victim 1'.
