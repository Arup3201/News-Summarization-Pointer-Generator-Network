Billy Connolly has made his first public appearance since being diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease at a New York movie premiere - dressed up in a pair of tartan pants.

The Scottish comic was diagnosed with Parkinson’s during surgery for prostate cancer in the US, it emerged last week.

But after vowing to remain active and working, the 70-year-old star turned up to the Cinema Society screening of movie thriller A Single Shot in Manhattan on Thursday night.

The Big Yin looked slightly wan but happily chatted to friends at the screening.

Back to Tartan: Billy Connolly makes his first public appearance since revealing he has Parkinson's Disease at a screening of thriller A Single Shot in New York on Thursday night

Although his surgery for prostate cancer was a 'total success', doctors spotted signs of the shaking disorder in the star, who is currently staying at his multi-million dollar home in New York.

As many as one million Americans live with Parkinson's - and 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with the disease each year.

Parkinson’s is a 
chronic neurological disorder caused by a loss of brain cells that 
produce dopamine.

Symptoms include tremors while the victim 
rests, rigidity of muscles, slowness of movement, unsteady balance and 
memory loss.

Last month, Grammy-winning singer Linda Ronstadt revealed she was suffering from the disease. But it has not stopped high-profile sufferer and campaigner Michael J.Fox from debuting a new sitcom this month.

Back To The Future actor Fox, 
now 52, was diagnosed as a sufferer at the age of 30.

And Billy's spokeswoman has already revealed that, despite the setback, the star will continue with his work commitments.

She
said last week: ‘Billy has been assured by experts that the findings will in no 
way inhibit or affect his ability to work, and he will start filming a 
TV series in the near future, as well as undertaking an extensive 
theatrical tour of New Zealand in the new year.’

Fans were concerned earlier this year when Billy admitted he had started to forget his lines during performances.

A show at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in April was marred by forgetful moments where he asked the audience what he was talking about.

At the time, the father of five, who is married to Pamela Stephenson,, said: ‘This is terrifying. I feel like I’m going out of my mind.’

Actor Bob Hoskins, also 70,  announced his retirement after he was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease last year.

There is no cure and scientists have been unable to establish the cause.

Billy was the first superstar of 
stand-up, but also built a successful career as an actor, starring in a 
series of blockbuster films.

He has also presented some hugely successful travel programs often linked to his stand-up tours.

Billy was made a CBE in the 2003 Queen's Birthday Honours and awarded the freedom of his home city of Glasgow in 2010.

Billy joined stars including Sam Rockwell, who headlines A Single Shot, and his girlfriend, actress Leslie Bibb, Homeland actor Rupert Friend and Gossip Girl star Kelly Rutherford at the screening, which was then followed by a party at the new Bar Naná.
