After a raucous Davis Cup victory over the USA, Great Britain must now decide which surface will give them the best chance of upsetting the French in the quarter-finals.

As the home side, GB can choose the venue for the July 17 clash against last year's runner-up. It is tempting to stick with the indoor hard court in Glasgow where the local fans created a tremendous atmosphere last weekend, but, in this case, the grass is greener.

Andy Murray has a good record on hard courts against France's fearsome quartet of Richard Gasquet, Gael Monfils, Gilles Simon and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, winning 18 and losing five. But on grass, he has been totally dominant, unbeaten against all four in six matches.

Against Gasquet and Tsonga in particular, Murray can draw on the memories of some famous victories on the lawns. In 2011 the 27-year-old beat Tsonga in the final of the Aegon Championships at Queens. He also defeated the world No 13 in the Wimbledon semi-finals on the way to lifting the trophy in 2012.

And it was a 2008 last-16 win against Gasquet on centre court that made the nation realise that this wild-haired Scot had something very special. A 21-year-old Murray stormed back from two sets down to win 5-7, 3-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-4.

There is more good news for the doubles players. Julien Benneteau has reached 17 doubles finals but none have been on grass. Nicolas Mahut has won a tournament on the grass of Newport in 2013, but all of his other seven titles have come on an indoor hard court like Glasgow.

Britain's pair of Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot, meanwhile, have thrived on grass. The Scot has one title and two finals appearances on the green stuff, and the Englishman won at Eastbourne last year.

So GB should forgo the cauldron of the Emirates Arena in Glasgow for the more sedate lawns of Nottingham or Eastbourne, assuming the Wimbledon grass will not have had time to recover.
