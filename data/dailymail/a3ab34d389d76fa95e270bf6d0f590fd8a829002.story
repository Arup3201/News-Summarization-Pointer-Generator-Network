Almost two million working young adults are still living with their parents because they cannot afford to move out, a report reveals today.

A quarter of 20 to 34-year-olds who have a job are part of the 'clipped wing' generation, unable to fly the nest, housing charity Shelter warned.

House prices are rising faster for first-time buyers than people already on the housing ladder, making it even harder for them to leave their family home.

The 'clipped wing' hotspots include Castle Point in Essex where 45 per cent of working 20 to 34-year-olds live with their parents; Knowsley in Merseyside where the figure is 42 per cent; and Solihull where 38 per cent of young working adults still live in the home they grew up in

Census data shows that there are 1.97 million people aged 20-34 in England who are still living with their parents, accounting for one quarter of all young adults in employment.

A survey commissioned by the Shelter also found that nearly half (48 per cent) of 250 young adults who live with their parents said they do so because they cannot afford to rent or buy their own home.

Shelter said its analysis of the Census data uncovered several areas where the proportion of adult children living with their parents is much higher.

It named nation's 'clipped wing' hotspots as Castle Point in Essex where 45 per cent of working 20 to 34-year-olds live with their parents; Knowsley in Merseyside where the figure is 42 per cent; and Solihull where 38 per cent of young working adults still live in the home they grew up in.

Sarah, 32, lives with her parents in the family home in Croydon. 

She works in online advertising, but has been living on and off with her parents for the past 10 years while trying to save for a deposit.

Sarah said: 'I'm trying really hard to save up and get my own place but today's rollercoaster house prices mean the goal posts keep moving.

'If I move out now the reality is I'll be stuck paying expensive rents for the rest of my life. 

'I know I'm lucky to have a job and somewhere to live, but the thought that I'm going to be living like a teenager into my late 30s or even 40s is really disheartening.'

Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: 'The "clipped wing generation" are finding themselves with no choice but to remain living with mum and dad well into adulthood, as they struggle to find a home of their own.

'Rather than pumping more money into schemes like Help to Buy, we need bolder action that will meet the demand for affordable homes and not inflate prices further.

'From helping small local builders find the finance they need, to investing in a new generation of part rent, part buy homes, the solutions to our housing shortage are there for the taking.

'Politicians of all parties must now put stable homes for the next generation at the top of the agenda.'

Emma Reynolds, Labour’s shadow housing minister, said: 'This research shows that the next generation is being priced out of home ownership.

'Unless we build many more affordable homes working people will be denied their dream of owning their own home.

'Yet under David Cameron house building has fallen to its lowest level in peacetime since the 1920s.

'Labour is clear that you can’t deal with the cost-of-living crisis without building more homes. That’s why Labour has committed to getting 200,000 homes a year built by 2020.'

Latest figures show that house prices paid by first-time buyers are up 11.3 per cent year-on-year, compared to 10.7 per cent for people who already home a property.

Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'We’re determined to ensure anyone who works hard and wants to get on the property ladder has the help they need to do so.

'That’s why we’ve introduced Help to Buy, which has helped over 35,000 people to date get on the property ladder with a fraction of the deposit they would normally require. 

The scheme is also directly helping build new homes and increase housing supply, with private housebuilding up 34 per cent since the scheme’s launch. On top of this, we’re investing £1billion through our Build to Rent scheme to build new homes specifically for private rent.

'Our efforts have got Britain building, meaning that since 2010 we’ve delivered 445,000 newly-built homes – including nearly 200,000 new affordable homes.'
