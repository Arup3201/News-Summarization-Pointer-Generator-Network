A woman has been reunited with her long lost mother decades after she had to give her away in heartbreaking circumstances.

Kate Jarrett, 27, from Kent, thought she would never find her biological parent as she had a closed adoption and so received no help from social services in the search.

She spent years trawling through social media and family tree websites to try to track her down.

In fact all Kate had to go on was a cassette tape given to her by her adoptive parents on her 16th birthday, that had a recording of her mother's voice on.

Success: Kate, pictured with her youngest daughter Sophie, has finally found her own biological mother after years of searching

The tape was recorded by Karen Irons, now 46, from Middlesbrough, more than a decade earlier and explained why she had given her up as a baby.

Kate said: 'It's a very sad story. She was young and had no support... I always had a gut feeling that she never wanted to give me away.'

On the tape Karen confessed she had come home from a night out to collect Kate from a babysitter and dropped her on concrete stairs.

Kate was rushed to hospital where police questioned Karen, then 19, about the unexplained bruise - and then took her baby away. Kate was put into foster care and at the age of eight months Paul and Sue Jarrett, from Luton, adopted her.

As a teenager, Kate listened to Karen's recording again and again and decided to find her mother.

She got in touch with social services - but as it was a closed adoption they were unable to help her. 

Kate explained: 'I was just fobbed off. So I knew if I was going to get anywhere I was on my own.' 

Voice from the past: Kate was given this tape on her 16th birthday which her mother had recorded more than a decade before explaining why she had her adopted

Reunited: Kate with her mother, Karen, and her partner, Tony. The mother and daughter were separated for 27 years after Kate was adopted

She spent years searching sites specialising in ancestry, births, deaths and marriages. 

'I tried everything, but lead after lead just ran cold,' she said.

In the meantime, she started her own family having daughters Fayth, 10, Natalie, nine, and Sophie, two, and moved to Chatham, Kent, with boyfriend Mike Wilcock, 28, a warehouse manager.

She remained determined to find her real mother and finally a breakthrough came after she spotted an advert for a private detective who, after hearing her story, waived her charges and took on her case for free.

They eventually tracked down Karen, discovering she had married and moved to Middlesborough, where she had another daughter - Suzie Cullen, 22 - a sibling Kate never knew she had.

Kate said hearing of the discovery came as a huge shock.

Surprise sibling: Kate also discovered she had a sister, Suzie, right

She recalled: 'I had trouble breathing. I just collapsed in tears. It took me two days to summon up the courage to message Suzie.

'We spoke for hours, trying to fill in the blanks, but none of it making much sense.'

Kate then met her mother in a tearful reunion when her adoptive father drove her on the five-and-a-half hour journey to visit her in Middlesbrough.

Kate said: 'At first it was just like one of our normal days out, but when I saw the sign to Middlesbrough, it all kicked in. I was very nervous. Suzie answered the door and we gave each other a massive hug.

'She led me into the living room and there she was in the flesh - my mum sitting on the sofa. I got down on my knees and we just held each other for about 45 minutes.'

She added: 'There was an instant bond, everything just clicked. It was just like the missing piece of a jigsaw had been found.'

Kate's real mum Karen is now determined to make up for lost time by moving to Kent to be near Kate and her family. 

She is wheelchair bound and has been in poor health in recent years but Kate said their reunion has given her a renewed vigor.

Kate said: 'I've been told she has improved in health since we met. She has told me she has the fight in her.'
