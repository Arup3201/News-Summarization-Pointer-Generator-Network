Sitting on the substitutes bench, his night already over, Rickie Lambert must have watched Liverpool’s late comeback and struggled to be phlegmatic.

For 70 minutes the Liverpool centre forward - still awaiting his first goal for the club - had struggled in a team seemingly incapable of playing to his strengths.

As a rather lame home defeat beckoned, though, things changed.

First Fabio Borini crossed in front of the Kop for Mario Balotelli to score from six yards and then a free-kick struck deep to the far post in injury time was headed in by central defender Dejan Lovren.

Undoubtedly, Lambert would have fancied his chances with both. As he lies awake at night, that is what the 32-year-old must wish for. A cross right on to his instep, a mistake from a goalkeeper. Something he can’t miss. Something to get him going.

Deep in his footballer’s soul, though, Lambert will know that his troubles at Anfield are not down to misfortune. Footballers always know and as such Lambert will appreciate that his Liverpool career - such as it is - is stalling because of his own failings.

Liverpool have a problem with goals in the post-Luis Suarez era, that much is clear. This time last season they had scored 28 times. Already they are nine behind the rate.

Lambert, though, looks like a centre forward simply waiting for things to happen. If he carries on in this vein, they simply will not.

On Tuesday night he was largely static, inert. He was tidy at times but he never bullied the Swansea central defenders, never ran the channels, never stretched anyone. As a consequence, he had one shot, straight at the goalkeeper from 18 yards a minute before he was replaced by Balotelli with 11 left.

Keep in mind just how ordinary Liverpool’s centre forwards have been this season and the Lambert issue becomes clear.

Balotelli had scored once before Tuesday night. Daniel Sturridge has not played since September because of injury. Yet Lambert has been used so sparingly it is almost embarrassing.

In the Barclays Premier League, he has started one game and lasted an hour. In six other league games he has been given a total of exactly 90 minutes as a substitute. For England, he has been used as a replacement three times, two of those appearances beginning in the 89th minute.

The sympathetic may suggest Lambert merely hasn’t been given an opportunity. How can you score goals if you don't play? Centre forwards depend on rhythm after all.

However, the more cynical may say that Lambert has shown nothing in training sessions to suggest he is ready for a place. To take that theory to its logical end is to wonder if Rodgers is beginning to wonder if the £4million he gave to Southampton in the summer was a waste of money.

Other - more expensive - signings have struggled too this season.

Lazar Markovic - who cost £20m - was wretched against Swansea while Emre Can - £10m – has played only twice. However, Lambert’s story is more poignant because of its symbolism, the beetroot boy given a chance at his boyhood club.

One feels that a goal may spur him but it looks some way distant at the moment and perhaps he should take something from the approach of Jonjo Shelvey.

A player sold by Liverpool because he wasn’t good enough, the midfielder always returns to Anfield as though determined to prove the club were wrong. Last season he scored here for Swansea from 30 yards and again he was excellent on Tuesday night.

Shelvey arrives at Anfield to enjoy himself. Lambert looks frankly cowed.
