The great landscapes of America are showcased in a stunning collection of photographs that have become an instant online hit.

A range of iconic natural attractions feature in the collection including the night sky over the Grand Canyon and the glorious greenery of Yosemite National Park.

The glorious images, which have gained thousands of 'likes' online, were released by the U.S. Department of the Interior - the agency tasked with protecting US land, water and wildlife.

The government department - an unlikely source for such a striking collection of photographs - has become a surprise hit online.

So far almost 40,000 people have followed its Instagram page where the images were first published.

The DOI, known as @usinterior, describes itself as 'protecting America's great outdoors and powering our future.'

It said it wants to highlight the dramatically diverse ecosystem and landforms that make up the U.S.

Among the natural phenomena featured in the collection are the ancient natural stone arches and monoliths at Utah's Arches National Park and awesome images taken from the Alaska Volcano Observatory.

Comments on the array

while being shared around the world.

A statement on the agency website reads: 'The U.S. Department of the Interior uses sound science to manage and sustain America's lands, water, wildlife, and energy resources, honours our nation's responsibilities to tribal nations, and advocates for America's island communities.

'As keepers our nation's legacy, we manage the resources in our care to benefit Americans now and in the future.

'Under the leadership of Secretary Sally Jewell, our department and its employees are developing and implementing the cutting-edge science and expert management techniques that make this possible.

'We are also taking actions to help America transform the challenges it faces today into opportunities for tomorrow.'
