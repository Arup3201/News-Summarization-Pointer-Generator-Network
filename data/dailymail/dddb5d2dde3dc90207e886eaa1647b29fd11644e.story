Moving jobs: Stephanie Flanders, who has worked at the BBC for 11 years, is heading to JP Morgan

Stephanie Flanders, the BBC’s long-time economics editor, has announced she is to quit the corporation to take up a lucrative role with investment bank JP Morgan.

Miss Flanders, who has worked at the BBC for 11 years, will take the role of chief market strategist at the Wall Street banking giant, in a role which experts have suggested could be worth more than £400,000-a-year and which could be around three times her current salary.

The 45-year-old will step down from her current role immediately, but will continue to present Radio 4’s Start the Week. She will begin her new job in November.

During her time at the BBC she worked on Newsnight, and presented on both TV and radio, notably her Stephanomics series on Radio 4, while she also presented the Masters of Money series on BBC2 last year.

She said yesterday that she was leaving the corporation because she said it was the right time for a new challenge.

Earlier this year it was revealed that Miss Flanders had dated Labour leader Ed Miliband and his shadow Chancellor Ed Balls during the 1990s.

Her move to JP Morgan echoes that of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, who took up a £2million-a-year role working as a part-time advisor for the firm after leaving office in 2008.

‘In many ways, I will be doing the same thing in my new job at JP Morgan Asset Management that I have been doing as Economics Editor: explaining what is happening in the economy and markets, and why it matters,’ she wrote in a final post on her BBC blog.

‘What will be different, in my new role, is that I will have more time and resources to develop my own ideas - and get a deeper understanding of the markets, inside one of the most experienced financial institutions in the world.

‘I will even (shock) be permitted to have an opinion - my own view. At least, if I can remember how, after 11 years of trying to avoid them.

‘The other thrill, for me, will be helping to grow a business. That is something I’ve never done, despite spending most of my working life as an economist, talking about the market economy. After 11 years at the BBC, this feels like the right time to give it a try.’

BBC business reporter Joe Lynam last night suggested that Miss Flanders’ move was a lucrative one.

He used his Twitter account to post the message: ‘My amazing colleague @BBCStephanie is to leave the BBC with almost immediate effect and join JP Morgan Asset Mgt. No money in journalism.’

It was shortly after taking up the role of economics editor in 2008 that she began a five-month period of maternity leave. It meant she was off work when the story of the credit crunch broke.

It was also in that year that she famously clashed with David Cameron when quizzing the prime minister over the Tory’s tax-breaks policy, asking if unmarried and well-off mothers like her would be persuaded to marry if they were offered extra money.

James Harding, the BBC’s director of news and current affairs, said Flanders had ‘given our audience unrivalled coverage of the economy – the most important story in Britain over the past few years.

High praise: Robert Peston, BBC business editor, said Miss Flanders has been 'the outstanding economics broadcaster of the last few years'

‘She has done it with intelligence, understanding and good judgement.  For the past 11 years she has been an exceptional journalist and broadcaster and she’ll be sorely missed. We all wish her every success in the future.’

Robert Peston, BBC business editor, added: ‘Stephanie has been the outstanding economics broadcaster of the last few years.

‘She has made an enormous contribution to the BBC, because of the authority and clarity of her journalism. We all wish her well in her new and challenging role, but I will feel the loss of an always stimulating and supportive colleague.’

JP Morgan would not reveal how much Miss Flanders will be paid in her new role, but the bank’s CEO and head of Global Funds Management, George Gatch, said: ‘Our fiduciary mindset as an asset manager is to help clients navigate the complexities of investing as they plan for retirement, save for education costs and sidestep the pitfalls inherent in volatile markets.

‘Stephanie’s experience and objective approach uniquely qualify her for doing this.’
