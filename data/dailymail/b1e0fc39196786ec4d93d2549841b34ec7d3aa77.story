Google's Street View has been given a video makeover by a Canadian firm who have used it to build videos of any journey.

Known as Hyperlapses, the videos are crated using a series of still images, rather like a traditional paper flipbook.

Users can enter any journey into the Hyperlapse site, and then see the results unfold as a video journey.

The site was created by Canadian design firm Teehan+Lax.

'Hyper-lapse photography – a technique 
combining time-lapse and sweeping camera movements typically focused on a
point-of-interest – has been a growing trend on video sites,' the firm 
said.

'Creating them requires precision and many hours stitching together photos taken from carefully mapped locations.

'We aimed at making the process 
simpler by using Google Street View as an aid, but quickly discovered 
that it could be used as the source material.

'It worked so well, we decided to design a very usable UI around our engine and release Google Street View Hyperlapse.'

To create a Hyperlapse, users first plot their route using Google Maps - for instance here, crossing Manhattan Bridge

The site then creates a 'flipbook' video of Google Street view images

To recreate the feel of a flipbook, the developers said they kept the speed of the video low.

'The site settings are purposely low (like having a maximum of 60 frames per animation) for greater accessibility.'

'The idea for this project came from one 
of our motion designers, Jonas, as part of his Labs experiment.

He 
wanted to explore a tool that could help him create hyper-lapse videos 
with the assistance of available data sets and emerging technology.

'The results are pretty 
stunning.'
