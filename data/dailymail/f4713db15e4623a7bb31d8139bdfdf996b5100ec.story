An exquisite private collection of antique paintings, sculptures and furniture owned by one of Europe's most accomplished former fashion editors is set to go under the hammer.

La Rosa di Montevecchia: An Italian Villa comprises over 200 lots found in the collector's Lake Como home, all reflecting her passion for the natural world, and expects to fetch over £360,000 in total.

As the voice of luxury fashion magazines including Harper's Bazaar Italy, Vogue Italy and Vogue France, the unnamed former editor had an eye for design and a talent for mixing different periods and styles, and items on offer range from £500 to £25,000.

Located between the bustling city of Milan and the rolling countryside around Lake Como, the majestic 18th Century villa that housed the items is set within a spectacular garden, brimming with over 300 species of rare, near-extinct roses.

'Risorgimento', the unification struggle of the 1860s.

The auction takes place on 1 July at Christie's in South Kensington, London.
