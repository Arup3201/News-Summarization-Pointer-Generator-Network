Faced with the devastating news her unborn child might not survive pregnancy, Robyn Wilson was advised to opt for an abortion.

The 25-year-old was told at her first ultrasound scan it was highly likely her son had a serious, life-limiting illness, like Down's Syndrome.

An appointment was booked for a termination.

But just days before she was due to go through with the procedure, Mrs Wilson and her husband Adam, 26, decided against it.

Robyn and Adam Wilson were advised to abort their unborn son after a 12-week scan revealed there was a chance he would be born with a life-limiting illness. Doctors warned baby Harry was unlikely to survive pregnancy and a termination appointment was booked

But the couple refused the abortion, and months later welcomed their healthy son, Harry, who is now about to celebrate his second birthday

Mrs Wilson said: 'We were told if the baby did live to birth, it might die shortly after, or that if it survived, it would be seriously ill or have health defects. There was still that slither of hope, but they advised us the best thing to do would be to have an abortion'

They decided to carry on with their pregnancy and give their unborn child the best chance.

Months later the couple were overjoyed when Mrs Wilson gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Harry.

Mrs Wilson said she and her husband clung to a 'slither of hope' that their baby would survive.

Now as she prepares to celebrate Harry's second birthday, she said: 'After being handed the results, we were told there was a very high chance our baby would die before birth.

'We were told if he did live to birth, he might die shortly after, or that if he survived, he would be seriously ill or have health defects.

'There was still that slither of hope but they told us advised us the best thing to do would be to have an termination.

'When we were advised to abort, everything was just rushing through my mind - I just kept thinking "what would be worse having an abortion or having the baby in my arms for just a few minutes or days, maybe weeks?".

'I thought I was never going to get that first hug, his first birthday party or that first day at school - let alone more.

'I thought it had all been taken away from me before it had even begun. But he's my best friend. I wouldn't change a thing. He's so perfect.'

Miss Wilson, from Worksop, Nottinghamshire, was shocked to discover she was pregnant on January 23, 2012, shortly after starting a new job as a golf course supervisor.  

In spite of the difficult timing, the couple decided to continue with the pregnancy.

Though Harry appeared to be fine when he was born, Mrs Wilson said she spent the first year of his life worrying he would suddenly be diagnosed with something

But she said she is now able to relax and enjoy Harry's second birthday - a milestone she never thought she'd get to enjoy

At their 12-week scan at Bassetlaw Royal Hospital on March 19, 2012, they were told  it was highly likely they had a Down's Syndrome baby and emergency blood tests were carried out the same day.

The results revealed a heightened risk of Edward Syndrome or Patau Syndrome - both serious genetic disorders that limit life expectancy.

Miss Wilson was referred to nearby Jessops Hospital, a maternity unit in Leeds, where she claims doctors advised her that her best option could be to terminate the pregnancy.

She said: 'The hospital decided to book me in for an abortion to get rid of the baby - though they said it wasn't compulsory.

'The option was there and they advised that it could be for the best, as they were fairly certain something was going to be wrong with the baby.

'Adam and I were a complete mess, it's really not what we wanted to happen.

'We wanted to be telling people about the baby at this point - not finding ourselves unsure as to whether or not there would be a baby.'

Doctors pencilled in a temporary abortion slot for March 26.

Mss Wilson then underwent one final test, a CVS - a prenatal test to determine chromosomal abnormalities.

And on March 23, just three days before the scheduled termination, the pair were shocked to discover results showed no problems with their unborn child.

Despite medics insisting something must be wrong, heart and diaphragm scans appeared to show no obvious illnesses or deformities.

She said: 'He was absolutely perfect when he was born. They rushed him off as they were expecting to find something wrong with him but he was completely fine'

Following 12 scans and three tests, Miss Wilson gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Harry, on September 27, 2012, weighing 8lbs 5oz.

Though Harry appeared to be fine, Miss Wilson said she spent the first year of his life worrying that he would suddenly be diagnosed with something.

But she said she is now able to relax and enjoy Harry's second birthday - a milestone she never thought she'd get to enjoy.

She said: 'He was absolutely perfect when he was born. They rushed him off as they were expecting to find something wrong with him but he was completely fine.

'I couldn't really enjoy the first few months of motherhood.

'Every time a doctor could come around I would be thinking "this is it, this is it, someone is going to tell me what is wrong now", but still to this day that hasn't come.

'The doctors and nurses couldn't believe it, they all call him "the legend baby".

'This year for his birthday we are going to go all out. Everyone is coming around and there is going to be food and a bouncy castle.

'I feel now I can finally stop worrying and enjoy life with Harry.'

A spokesperson for Jessops Hospital declined to comment.
