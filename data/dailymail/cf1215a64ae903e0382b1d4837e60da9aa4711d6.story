Theresa May said the scheme, which is being tested in Surrey and Sussex and will handle non-emergency calls, will free up frontline officers

Victims should report crime online to help cut the number of 999 calls, the Home Secretary declared yesterday.

Theresa May said using the internet would save police money and free up officers for frontline work. Already being tested at two forces, the scheme would cover non-emergency cases such as criminal damage and minor theft.

Campaigners warned however that online reporting would further reduce face-to-face contact between police and public at a time when many local stations have closed.

There are also fears it might give officers an excuse not to visit crime scenes or even ignore offences entirely. 

The Home Office stressed that victims of serious crimes, including rape, burglary and assault, should still dial 999. 

Mrs May said: ‘The growth in the internet has transformed other services – from shopping to banking – and it is right to give victims and witnesses greater choice over how they report issues to the police.’

She said the measure could cut police costs by £3.7million and free up an estimated 180,000 officer hours a year – potentially putting more bobbies on the beat.

The Home Office, which is working on a prototype with the Surrey and Sussex police forces, says the scheme will go nationwide within months.

Some forces already allow victims to report offences via the web but this initiative would create a one-size-fits-all system for England and Wales.

Mrs May insisted victims of crimes such as burglaries and rapes should still call 999, but one force which has developed its own online service includes stalking, domestic abuse and sex offences in its system

Ministers have not yet drawn up a definitive list of offences suitable for reporting online. 

But one force has included stalking, domestic abuse and some sex offences – all of which attract prison sentences.

The online crime reports would be studied by police staff who would decide how to respond. Before the 101 police number was launched – also to reduce 999 calls – research revealed that 80 per cent of emergency calls did not need an urgent response.

But in just 12 months more than a million 101 callers failed to get through and many were left hanging on for more than an hour.

David Green, director of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘The problem with dealing with a screen rather than talking to a person is that it depersonalises the experience.

‘It feels like you are a crime statistic instead of asking the police to act in defence of the public.

‘At a time when confidence in the police is falling, it would be better if the police were advised to maximise their contact with the public and not to go in search of devices which mean they have as little contact as possible, even if it does save money.’

But Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank, said: ‘New measures to encourage people to report crimes are very welcome.

‘Sometimes people will feel more comfortable contacting police in this way, especially if they can do so anonymously.’

But campaigners fear the move could give police an excuse to not attend crime scenes themselves, or to ignore call-outs entirely (file image)

And Mark Castle, of the charity Victim Support, said: ‘Giving victims more choice and control over their journey through the criminal justice system is something we would of course welcome.’

Policing Minister Mike Penning said: ‘Smartphones, tablets and internet devices are opening up new opportunities for the way people contact the police and forces need to be ready.’

In the past three years, an estimated 264 police station counters have closed – one in five of the national total.
