Former New Zealand cricket captain Chris Cairns won £90,000 libel damages today over an accusation of match-fixing which he said turned his achievements to 'dust'.

The 41-year-old, who notched up the rare double of 200 wickets and 3,000 runs in his 62 Tests, had sued Lalit Modi, ex-chairman of Twenty20 franchise the Indian Premier League (IPL), over an 'unequivocal allegation' on Twitter in January 2010.

He was not at London’s High Court for the ruling by Mr Justice Bean, who heard the case without a jury.

The judge said that Modi had 
'singularly failed' to provide any reliable evidence that Cairns was 
involved in match-fixing or spot-fixing, or even that there were strong
grounds for suspicion that he was.

He said: 'It is obvious that an 
allegation that a professional cricketer is a match-fixer goes to the 
core attributes of his personality and, if true, entirely destroys his 
reputation for integrity.

'The allegation is not as serious as 
one of involvement in terrorism or sexual offences (to take two examples
from recent cases). But it is otherwise as serious an allegation as 
anyone could make against a professional sportsman.'

The judge heard that Modi’s tweet was picked up by cricket website Cricinfo.

When Cairns complained, Cricinfo 
withdrew its report, paid damages and apologised - but Modi declined to 
apologise and pleaded justification, maintaining that the charge was 
true.

Cairns’s case was that it was 'wholly 
untrue' and a very grave libel which could destroy all he had achieved 
over a distinguished 20-year career.

In evidence, he said: 'The defendant’s allegations have also had a profound effect on my personal and private life.

'It put a strain on my marriage. It hurts that my wife may think that I am not the man she thought I was.

'It hurts me too that friends, many of
whom are former cricketing foes, will question my integrity as a man 
and a sportsman and that all I achieved in the great game of cricket is 
dust.'

In 2007 and 2008, Cairns captained the
Chandigarh Lions in three competitions in the Indian Cricket League 
(ICL), which flourished briefly before the ascendancy of the IPL.

The allegation made by Modi related 
to the second and third of these competitions, between March and April 
2008 and October and November that year.

Later, Cairns said in a statement: 
'Today’s verdict lifts a dark cloud that has been over me for the past 
two years. I feel mixed emotions.

'Firstly, sadness that I should ever 
have had to put myself, my friends and my family through this because of
one man’s misdirected allegations.

'But I also feel great joy because my 
past career has come through unscathed and remains intact and because I 
had the courage to stand up in the highest court to defend my name.'

He added: 'Lastly, I feel great relief that I am able to walk into any cricket ground in the world with my head held high.'

The judge granted Modi permission to 
appeal over the amount of damages but refused permission on the question
of liability, although Modi’s lawyers are set to pursue that 
application with the Court of Appeal direct.

He also ordered Modi to pay £400,000 on account of costs to Cairns’ solicitors within 28 days.
