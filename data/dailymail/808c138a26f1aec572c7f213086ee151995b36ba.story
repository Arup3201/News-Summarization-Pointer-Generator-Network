Leicester GP Michael Summer under declared his earnings for four years, avoiding £185,000 in Tax 

A doctor lied about his salary to dodge paying £185,000 in tax and live the luxury life he had become accustomed to - sending his children to private school and going on expensive holidays.

Dr Michael Summer, 46, earned more than £750,000 yet paid tax and national insurance on only half that amount.

One year the GP only declared a quarter of his earnings - avoiding thousands in tax which he spent on renovations to his £400,000 home in Leicester and overseas holidays. 

He also used the money to take his family to China where he was born, and buy several expensive cars including a BMW 5 Series and a £50,000 Maserati.  

A judge said the talented doctor had 'brought the tragedy on himself' and his family by under declaring his income - in one instance by as much as £200,000.

The fraud took place between 2008 and 2012. 

When his evasion was exposed he tried to tell inspectors from HM Revenue and Customs that he 'wasn't good with numbers.'

Summer managed to build up his salary by working as a self employed medical practitioner and also carried out examinations on members of the armed forces. 

Leicester Crown Court heard that the GP had previously been awarded £500,000 after he was injured in a motorbike accident. 

He had apparently got used to living the lifestyle that this payout afforded, the court was told.

Summer admitted four counts of fraudulent evasion of income tax by grossly under declaring his salary.

He was jailed for 18 months for each offence, to run concurrently.

Judge Nicholas Dean QC said he felt Summer knew what he had been doing, but he said he hoped the GP would be able to continue working as a doctor once he was released from prison. 

'This is in many ways a tragic case, but you've brought tragedy upon yourself and your family,' said Judge Dean. 

'Self-employment and an increased income led to you significantly under-declaring your income, which resulted in you paying significantly less income tax and national insurance than were due.

'Between 2008 and 2009 your under-declaration of income was quite modest, but it snowballed and by the final count you failed to declare income approaching £200,000.

'The total unpaid income tax and national insurance was £185,000 and that's a very considerable and serious fraud.

'I take the view you knew what you were doing.

'Having become used to a high income and spending considerable amounts of money, you continued and it may be that tempted you to under-declare your income.

'You knew perfectly well the true figures were substantially higher.

'There's also a great deal of good to be said about you, you're a doctor and have devoted your professional life to others and that's important.

Dr Summers downsized to a £400,000 home in Ratby in Leicester with his wife after his fraud was exposed

'It doesn't seem these offences touch upon your professionalism as a doctor and it's hoped you will be able to work again as a doctor in future.'

The court heard that Summer was earning a six figure salary in 2009 as a self employed medical practitioner, doing  examinations for solicitors and insurance companies for personal injury assessments. He had previously worked as a locum. 

Elizabeth Power, prosecuting, told the court Summer earned £254,533 in the tax year 2011 and 2012 but only declared earnings of £59,221.

For the 2008-2009 tax period he declared earnings of £36,791 instead of £48,563. 

In 2010 he declared £48,429 instead of £152,660, and in 2011 he declared £50,188 instead of £152,651.

He had lived in the affluent Houghton on the Hill district in Leicester, and drove luxury cars, but he has since downsized to a £415,000 home in Ratby, with his wife Ann Elizabeth, 40.

Helen Johnson, defending, said he became used to an 'expensive lifestyle' and his paperwork was 'in disarray' when he submitted his tax returns. Some of the money was used to renovate the kitchen at his previous home. 

In interview, Summer told police: 'There were so many things happening... that I just kept pushing it back and I said 'okay, I'll do it properly next time'.'

The court heard £100,000 has already been paid back and a proceeds of crime hearing is planned to take place next year. 

After the case, an HMRC spokesperson said: 'Suppressing your true income to reduce your tax bill will not be tolerated by HMRC or the public.

'Michael Summer spent vast sums on a luxury lifestyle, on his home, his holidays and even his car.

'We will not cease in our efforts to track down those who deliberately, and fraudulently, seek to gain a financial advantage over honest businesses.

'If Summer had come forward in 2010 and used the voluntary disclosure campaign to put his affairs in order, it would have been much less costly for him.'

In 2010, HMRC launched a campaign encouraging doctors and other medical professionals to declare their unpaid tax. To date the campaign has raised total revenue of more than £64million.
