Double-yellow lines in a Scottish village immortalised in the classic novel Sunset Song are to be painted a pale shade of primrose so as not to detract from its historic charms.

Councillors voted that the new 'no parking' traffic markings in Auchenblae, Kincardineshire should be light yellow 'in sympathy' with its conservation status.

But residents branded the idea 'mad' and voiced fears that the new lines would be ignored because people wouldn't know what they mean.

Ian Mollison, Liberal Democrat member for North Kincardine, said: 'As a driver, when you see double yellow lines you know what they mean.

'If you see primrose or cream lines, well I am sure it's very tasteful but you don't have a clue what they mean.

'You might think a local resident has been at it with a tin of Dulux.'

Liz McDonald, 50, said: 'I think it is a bit mad. If the double yellow lines are primrose, will people just ignore them?'

This will be the first time double yellow lines have been introduced in the village as residents have objected to them in the past, given its picture-postcard appeal.

Joiner Alexander Adams, 60, said: 'If it is a conservation area, there should be no double-yellow lines at all if they want to keep it the way it was.  

The issue was discussed at Aberdeenshire Council's Kincardine and The Mearns Area Committee as a new traffic management plan for Auchenblae was approved.

Officials say the village has become busier, with restrictions needed to stop illegal parking and increase the safety of pedestrians and other road users.

Stuart McFarlane, Aberdeenshire Council's roads manager for Kincardine and Mearns, said: 'The colour will be a lighter yellow and less harsh to tie in with the conservation area.

'No-one should have any misunderstanding that they are double yellow lines.' 

The village was granted conservation status last autumn and is said to have important historic interest as an early mill town of the late 18th Century.

It was immortalised in Lewis Grassic Gibbon’s 1932 novel, Sunset Song, which was named the 'Best Scottish Book of All Time' at the Edinburgh International Book Festival in 2005.

Auchenblae has 75 listed buildings with the conservation status protecting buildings on the village's Inverurie Street, High Street and Market Square, as well as the school and parish church.
