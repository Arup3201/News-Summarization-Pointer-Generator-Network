A 56-year-old woman and her five-year-old grandson miraculously emerged with minor injuries from a car accident after they were both run over on Tuesday in Anapolis in the state of Goias, Brazil.

A split second after the accident happens, the youngster gets up and walks over to his grandmother, who is lying on the floor, as if nothing has happened. Both are already home after the accident after being discharged from hospital suffering from minor injuries.

The incident was captured on CCTV cameras, which show the moment Vilma do Nascimento and João Pedro Nascimento were hit when a runaway car collided with a stationery vehicle pushing it into their path.

The accident happened as the pair walked up an Anapolis street

The footage shows two people walking side by side in the road, just yards from the pavement. Up ahead, a car approaching the crossroads at speed from a road on the left of the screen crashes into another as it crosses the junction.

Despite the efforts of the second car to swerve out of the way, the vehicle coming from the left fails to stop. The impact sends the car careering down the road where it collides with a stationery white car.

Seeing the split-second accident unfold just metres in front of them, the grandmother grabs her grandson’s hand and rushes quickly towards the pavement in an attempt to avoid the car, which is hurtling towards them out of control.

But before they can reach safety the speeding car collides with the parked car shoving it into a reversed curved spin onto the pavement where it slams into the pair.

The stationery car has been hit so hard, it races backwards only coming to rest seconds later after it has rolled over the victims twice – the body and head of the child and the legs and back of the women.

Even as the accident is happening, the five-year-old manages to raise his head as he looks up to see where his grandmother has fallen – the lower half of his body is already under the car.

A fraction of a second later the front wheel of the car rolls over the child’s head continuing over the grandmother’s back as she lays flattened on the floor by the impact.

‘I saw that the car run over him and come towards me. I thought my grandson’s skull had been crushed,’ Mrs Nascimento said in an interview with TV Anhanguera.

But within seconds of it happening the youngster stands up making what appears to be an amazing recovery and walks over to his grandmother as if nothing has happened.

The child later told reporters that he was more concerned about his grandmother than himself.

‘I thought my grandma had broken her spine and other things,’ he said.

A passer-by who rushes to help the victims looks totally bewildered by what has just occured.

‘It was so quick. I tried to run to the sidewalk but unfortunately the stationary car hit us. It was a miracle we survived,’ the grandmother said.

‘I’m sure God’s hand protected us. João doesn’t even look like he’s been hit at all,’ she added showing off the bruises to her grandson’s face.

Both are already home from hospital after undergoing a series of examinations. João was discharged on the same evening after the accident with minor abrasions to the right side of his face, chin and ear, and his grandmother was released Wednesday morning suffering from cuts and bruises to her legs and head.

‘The doctors said Joao’s injuries are just superficial. I’m not walking properly just yet but I have no fractures,’ Mrs Nascimento revealed.

‘It’s just amazing. João is already back playing with his friends and everyone is celebrating our survival.’

The drivers involved in the accident have both complained about the lack of signaling at the junction.

The motorist who caused the accident denied speeding towards the intersection but admitted a degree of guilt.

‘I wasn’t paying attention as I approached the junction at the time but I don’t believe I was speeding,’ said Henrique Araújo, a sales representative.

The other driver, João Birajara Camargo, also a salesman said: ‘I believe it was my right of way but I would have been able to avoid the accident if he hadn’t been speeding. I think he must have been doing at least 40kmph before he hit me.’

Anapolis local authority said it would be installing traffic lights before the end of the week.
