An Australian woman has gone into labour aboard a Malaysian Airlines flight from Malaysia to Brisbane, forcing it to make an emergency stop in Bali 

Head of medical services Diah Ratna Dewi says when the patient arrived, the baby of around 24-weeks had already been delivered and was deceased.

'We estimate the baby was born 1-1.5 hours before we received her,' she said.

The woman was treated and picked up by her airline around 9pm, the doctor said. 

The plane with 178 passengers on board landed.
