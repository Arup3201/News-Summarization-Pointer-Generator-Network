Sean Dyche has faith that Burnley's numbers game will eventually see them come good in the Barclays Premier League.

The Clarets are propping up the table after six matches and are yet to win since returning to the top flight.

Defensively, Dyche's side exceeded expectations by keeping three consecutive clean sheets prior to last weekend's 4-0 capitulation at West Brom, but they have also drawn six successive blanks in all competitions.

Sean Dyche says his Burnley team will eventually find their scoring form having netted just one goal this term 

Danny Ings' 21 league goals in the Championship last season helped fire Burnley to Premier League promotion

Sam Vokes formed part of a potent strike force with Ings last season, netting 20 Championship goals

A lack of firepower has not been helped by injuries to last year's potent strike pairing of Danny Ings and Sam Vokes but Dyche insists that a dispassionate analysis of Burnley's output so far tells a brighter story than the bare facts of their goal drought.

'We're only under the microscope because we haven't scored since the opening day of the season,' he said at a press conference ahead of Saturday's trip to Leicester. 

'We also debrief with the players and behind all that we have the pro zone stats to work with. 

'One example of that is six games into last season, we had 80 efforts at goal and 40 on target.

'This season after six games in the Premier League we've had 72 efforts at goal and 37 on target which is a statistically higher amount. 

One of the players charged with dragging Burnley out of their current scoring rut is deadline day signing George Boyd.

The former Hull man has settled quickly in his new environment and now wants to put things right on the pitch.

'I'm loving it, there's a great team spirit here,' he said.

'The boys have been great and have made me feel really welcome. I'm loving the training and it's nice to be playing week in, week out.

'It's very similar to last year with Hull. We had a great team spirit there and that alone will get you several points a season.

'It's just important that we stick together as a group. As long as we do it, the goals and wins will come and we'll be fine.'
