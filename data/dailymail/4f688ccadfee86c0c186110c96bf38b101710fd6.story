An investigation into a shoplifting spree in the NSW Illawarra region has taken a twist and led to the arrest of a modern-day Fagin.

A 33-year-old woman will face court in August after she allegedly recruited children to commit shoplifting offences in the Lake Illawarra area over the past month.

This is similar to the story of Fagin - a fictional character in the Charles Dickens novel, Oliver Twist - who is described as a 'receiver of stolen goods' and mentors children to become criminals.

A 33-year-old woman was allegedly recruiting children to shoplift, similar to Fagin - depicted here by Alec Guinness in 1948's Oliver Twist - who mentored kids into criminals

Police searched her home on Tuesday, where they allegedly found stolen goods as well as cannabis and a set of nunchuks.

A 14-year-old boy was also arrested at another house at Barrack Heights.

The woman was charged with six counts of larceny, four counts of recruiting a child to take part in criminal activity, offensive conduct and for stealing goods.

She has been granted condition bail to appear at Port Kembla Local Court on August 6.

The boy has been charged with six offences including larceny.

He was refused bail, to appear in children's court on Thursday.

The offences took place over the past month in the Lake Illawarra area in NSW's south
