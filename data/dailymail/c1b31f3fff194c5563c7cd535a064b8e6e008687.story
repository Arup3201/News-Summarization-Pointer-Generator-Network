A dog that nearly chewed her legs off after a cruel owner strung her up by her hindquarters for three days is recovering with new owners in Britain.

Irina, a collie-German Shepherd cross, was gagged, hung upside down by her back legs and left for dead by her previous owner in Romania.

Her rear legs were so tightly bound the rope had cut through her flesh, and she had desperately gnawed her own legs to the bone in an attempt to free herself.

After being strung up by her hind legs, Irina is now expected to make a full recovery from her horrific injuries

How she was found: The two-year-old had been strung up with rope and left upside down for three days

Safe Rescue, a British animal charity, heard of the two-year-old’s plight from local contacts and sent a team to save her.

Vets told them her injuries suggested she had been left hanging by her hind legs upside down for three days before being dumped in a garden, where she was found.

Irina then had three leg operations in Romania as well as treatment for a uterus infection.

She was then fostered by Kevin and Claire Quinn from Norfolk. She has since been given a permanent home in Reading and is expected to make a full recovery.

Offshore engineer Mr Quinn, 39, said: 'We were warned she may have been traumatised by her experiences and could have emotional issues, but nothing could be further from the truth.

'Irina is living proof of the resilience and forgiving nature of dogs - her only scars are physical and those are healing very well.

'One upsetting aspect of this is that knowing Irina as we do now, it is very likely that her tail was still wagging when those people were doing those terrible things to her.

'I don’t think she is capable of seeing the bad in people.'

Post-op: The dog was saved by British animal charity, Safe Rescue, and brought to start a new life in the UK
