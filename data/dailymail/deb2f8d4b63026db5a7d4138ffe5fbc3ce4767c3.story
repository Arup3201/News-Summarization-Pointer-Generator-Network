A Denver, Colorado mother has been shot dead in front of her children by her 'hallucinating' while she was on a 13 minute call to 911, police said.

Kristine Kirk, 44, called for help around 9:30p.m. Monday, telling dispatchers that her husband Richard Kirk, 47, was 'talking about the end of the world' and 'scarring' their three children. A source told FOX31 investigators are looking at whether he had eaten a marijuana cookie.

Mrs Kirk said in the 911 call that there was a gun in the house but it was in a safe, according to a probable cause statement.

'She then said that her husband retrieved the gun from the safe and she began to scream,' the statement reads. A gunshot could then be heard followed by silence.

Officers arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting.

'They were almost there,' Sonny Jackson, a Denver Police Department spokesman, told The Denver Post.

The 911 call lasted 13 minutes, police said. The delayed response time is being investigated by the DPD.

'Anytime a person dies while communicating with Denver's emergency services, we examine the circumstances to ensure that the incident was handled properly and we look for areas to improve upon,' Jackson said.

The call initially came through as a domestic disturbance but the longer it went on the more alarming it became, he said.

Family: In the 911 call, Mrs Kirk, shown center with her sons who are believed to have witnessed the murder, also told dispatchers her husband 'wanted her to shoot him,' according to the statement

When they did arrive, officers discovered Mrs Kirk on a floor inside the home with a bullet wound to the head. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mr Kirk was arrested and is being held on suspicion of first-degree murder.

According to the probable cause statement, he admitted to police that he shot his wife at their home. Jackson would not say whether a gun or drugs were recovered from the home.

The couple's children may have witnessed the crime.

Police were seen escorting a little boy to a patrol car outside the home.

In the call, Mrs Kirk also told dispatchers her husband 'wanted her to shoot him,' according to the statement.

Mr Kirk had no prior criminal record in Colorado, according to The Post. But Jackson confirmed investigators believe drugs may have been involved Monday night.

'We are looking at marijuana as a possible part of the investigation,' Jackson said.

Detectives streamed in and out of the home Tuesday morning carrying evidence boxes.

The family was well known in the neighborhood and their young boys played soccer and hockey with the local children.

'This is just incredible,' neighbor James Slater told the Post, shocked and overcome with emotion.

'Everybody knows them,' Slater said.
