Facebook may have bought Oculus Rift, but now Google is reportedly splashing out virtual reality technology too.

The search giant is set to invest $500 million (£314 million) in Magic Leap, which claims to have invented be a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality, dubbed ‘cinematic reality’.

The Florida-based firm’s website features a little elephant moving around realistically in a person’s hands, to show off their capabilities.

Gamers hope that Facebook and Google’s involvement in the virtual reality space will accelerate the technology, which would make playing games and watching films more realistic, as well as creating other immersive experiences.

Google is tipped to be joined by other large investors such as Andreessen Horowitz in the secretive fundraising round, Re/code reported, citing anonymous sources.

The company has already raised $50 million (£31 million) in funding earlier this year, but rumours of the new tranche of funding have not been confirmed by any of the parties involved.

Rory Abovitz, Magic Leap’s CEO, said his firm is working on ‘the most natural and human-friendly wearable computing interface in the world.’

Magic Leap's system claims to be more realistic than the Oculus Rift (pictured). The firm was acquired earlier this year by Facebook for $2 billion, and gamers are waiting for a consumer version of the virtual reality headset to be launched

An expert has claimed that ultra-realistic games played using virtual reality headsets could kill people.

Denny Unger believes that the technology is so immersive that the first incidence of someone being scared to death, is not far away.

Mr Unger, creative director at Cloudhead Games warned a virtual reality panel in Seattle that ‘we’re very close to having the first death in VR’,Gizmodo reported.

He said:‘When the commercial version comes out, somebody is going to scare somebody to death - somebody with a heart condition or something like that. It is going to happen. Absolutely.’

Many realistic video games played on standard consoles make players feel tense and villains often jump out and 'attack' gamers.

But this effect could be intensified hugely when virtual reality headsets become widely available.

Very few details about the technology have been revealed, aside from saying it offers a more realistic experience than Oculus Rift.

Mr Abovitz told The South Florida Business Journal that virtual reality and augmented reality are old terms, with a largely disappointing history. 

‘We have the term “cinematic reality” because we are disassociated with those things. … When you see this, you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years.

‘To go farther and deeper than we’re going, you would be changing what it means to be human.’

It is likely that the device will show wearers hi-resolution images close to their face, by projecting pictures onto the eye. Viewers will probably see different angles and depths when they adjust their focus.

This would be beneficial because Magic Leap could mix virtual reality images with the real world.

While it is not clear what form the technology takes, Mr Abovitz has previously said that he hopes it could one day be built into a pair of glasses, in which case, Google may aim on incorporating ‘cinematic reality’ into future iterations of Google Glass.

The smart spectacles already enable users to access augmented reality elements. Using a particular app for example, runners can wear the glasses to see monsters chasing them.

The glasses also superimpose information on the periphery of a wearer’s vision.

Facebook spent $2 billion buying Oculus earlier this year, which makes a virtual reality headset, mostly aimed at gamers.

Unlike Magic Leap’s future device, it blocks out the real world around the user.

Last month, Oculus unveiled its Crescent Bay model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor, and now features 360-degree tracking.

Reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as $200 (£122)

The 360-degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer's head movements, which in turn will make games more immersive and true-to-life.

Elsewhere, the headset has a higher resolution, per eye, than the current second-generation development kit – DK2 - and these displays are powered by Samsung devices.

A teardown of the DK2 revealed that the headset uses Samsung Galaxy Note 3 displays, and experts claim the latest generation device will feature screens from the flagship Note 4.

By comparison, the DK2 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye, and the Note 4 screens would give the latest model 1280 x 1440 resolution.

Aside from these specifications, Oculus VR is yet to release the rest of Crescent Bay’s features, or a price tag for the gadget.
