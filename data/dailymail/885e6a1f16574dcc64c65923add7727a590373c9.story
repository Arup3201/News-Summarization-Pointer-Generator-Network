The 16-year-old boy who murdered popular teacher Ann Maguire has lost a challenge to his 20-year minimum term.

William Cornick stabbed Mrs Maguire, 61, seven times from behind as she taught a Spanish class at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April last year. He was 15 at the time of the killing. 

Sentencing Cornick in November, Mr Justice Coulson told him that he must serve at least 20 years before he is eligible to seek parole but warned him: 'It's quite possible that day may never come.'

His lawyer, Richard Wright QC, had asked the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, Lady Justice Hallett and Mr Justice Globe to reduce his minimum sentence.

But today, the panel of three judges at the Court of Appeal in London, headed by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, rejected Cornick's appeal against the minimum term. 

They said that based on the 'disturbing' facts of the case, the sentencing judge came to 'entirely the right decision'. 

At his hearing last year, Leeds Crown Court heard Cornick sent a Facebook message weeks before the killing, which said of Mrs Maguire: 'The one absolute f****** b***h that deserves more than death, more than pain and more than anything that we can understand.' 

He later told a psychiatrist: 'I wasn't in shock, I was happy. I had a sense of pride. I still do.' The boy also said after the killing that he thought everything he had done was 'fine and dandy'.

Mrs Maguire had taught there for more than 40 years and was due to retire that September. 

Handing him a life sentence in November, Mr Justice Coulson said he showed a 'chilling lack of remorse' over the attack that saw him chase Mrs Maguire, 'stabbing her as she sought to escape'.

He set the 20-year tariff - the minimum time Cornick must serve in custody before he is released - but added that, after reading about him, 'it's quite possible that day may never come'.

Cornick dramatically pleaded guilty earlier, on the day he was due to stand trial for her killing.

The court was also told how Cornick had brought a bottle of whisky to school to celebrate after the attack, and had winked at a fellow pupil before starting to stab Mrs Maguire.

Cornick was said to have had a good family background with 'decent and responsible parents' - but wanted to be caught and jailed to avoid future worries about life and money.

Mr Wright said the sentence was too severe, on the ground of 'youth, and plea'.

'The general complaint is that 20 years for a 16-year-old, 15 when he committed the offence, is simply too long'. Mr Wright said his client was of good character.

He justified a delay in Cornick entering a guilty plea as being down to considerations of his mental health.

The sentencing was also condemned by youth campaigners, pointing out that he would be in prison for longer than he has been alive. 

Paul Greaney QC, said Cornick could not be described as being of 'good character', as he had 'fantasised about the murder of Mrs Maguire since he was 12 or 13'.

The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, rejected the appeal, saying the killer had developed a strange 'hatred of Spanish lessons and Mrs Maguire, his Spanish teacher'.

'He told more than one pupil that he hated her and wanted her dead,' the judge said.

The Lord Chief Justice reflected on the premeditated nature of the murder, and how he had shown off the knife to classmates.

'Those who thought he was serious received threats from him that he would kill them if they revealed his plan', the judge said.

'The applicant approached her from behind. He began to stab her in the neck and back. Whilst waiting for the police, he chatted as if nothing had happened. He had no remorse.' 

Mrs Maguire's widower, Don, who was in court today with daughters Emma and Kerry, earlier described the killing as a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil'.
