As identical twins Robyn and Scarlett Atherton will share many experiences in their life - but they will never share the same birthday despite being born 18 minutes apart.

Deborah Atherton, 35, from Bolton, gave birth to the sisters either side of midnight on November 9 and 10.

Robyn came first at 11.55pm on the Sunday weighing 4lbs 5oz, and Scarlett followed at 12.13am on the Monday weighing 5lbs 11oz.

Different birthdays: Identical twins Robyn and Scarlett Atherton were born either side of midnight

Proud mother: Deborah Atherton, 35, from Bolton, said she and her husband, Stuart, will let the girls decide when they are older if they want to celebrate their birthdays separately 

Deborah had joked during labour to her husband Stuart, 35, that as midnight approached their twins could have different birthdays.

Deborah, a deputy manager for children's services at Bolton Council, said: 'I never actually thought it would happen. There are three sets of twins in the family already but they're all non-identical.

'So we were shocked when it was another set of twins but this time they were identical.

'The closer it got to midnight, the more I was joking they could have different birthdays. They are such good babies, they are laid back and will only sleep together.'

Double vision: Deborah already has twin sisters, twin cousins and an aunty and uncle who are twins, as well as her new twin daughters

18 minutes between them: Robyn was born at 11.55pm on 9 November weighing 4lbs 5oz and Scarlett followed at 12.13am on 10 November weighing 5lbs 11oz

Robyn and Scarlett are the latest in a long line of twins in the family. Deborah has twin sisters, an aunty and an uncle who are twins and two of her cousins are twins.

But this is the first time any of the twins in her family have had a different birthday.

Both girls are healthy and settling in at their home in Bolton where their doting dad, a trainer at a medical legal company, has created memory boxes for them.

He filled them with hospital name tags, bibs and a copy of their local paper from the day they were born.

Sister act: The girls will share many experience growing up - even if they don't share the same birthday

However, they will have to share the paper as there wasn't an issue printed on Sunday - the day Robyn was born.

Deborah said they will let the girls decide when they are older whether they want to share a birthday or have their own celebrations on separate days.

She said: 'When they are younger we will celebrate their birthday on the same day but if when they get older they want to have their own birthdays then that's fine too.'
