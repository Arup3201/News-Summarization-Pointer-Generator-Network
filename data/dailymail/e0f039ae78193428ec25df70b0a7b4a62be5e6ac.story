A French free-climber known as 'Spiderman' has completed his latest daredevil feat by scaling a 700ft skyscraper in front of stunned onlookers.

Alain Robert climbed the 50-storey Bakrie Tower in Jakarta, Indonesia using suction cups and a safety harness, after police banned him from climbing with his bare hands.

Two years ago the 49-year-old tried to scale Indonesia's Wisma Mulia Tower bare-handed, but was caught by police and deported from the country.

Now after agreeing to safety conditions the daredevil was allowed back to Indonesia to reach the top of the 215m Bakrie Tower, one of Jakarta's tallest buildings.

Robert, who has made a career out of climbing the world's iconic skyscrapers with no safety support, reached the summit of the Bakrie Tower in just over two-and-a-half hours.

After his climb he said: 'This is a specific demand and right away I understood that there would be no possibility for me to use only my fingers.'

In the past two decades Robert has climbed more than 85 of the world's tallest buildings, including London's Canary Wharf, the Empire State Building, and the Eiffel Tower.

His tallest feat saw him climb to the top of the then world's tallest building, the 508m Taipei 101 in China, in December 2004.

On that occasion he wore a safety rope due to inclement weather conditions on his four-hour ascent.

He has suffered several falls resulting sometimes in serious fractures, and his high-climbing antics often see him fined or arrested.

In 2009 Mr Robert was fined £435 for climbing the 41-storey Royal Bank of Scotland building in Sydney.

Robert also climbs buildings in order to raise awareness of climate change.

On his website the climate change protester admits that climbing is ‘his passion, his philosophy of life’ – despite suffering from vertigo.

He also claims his obsession with climbing has left him ‘disabled up to 66 per cent’.

Describing his climbing achievements on his website, Robert says: 'We set ourselves limits, but we are all strong enough to aim higher, to achieve our goals.

'All we have to do is find such strength within ourselves. Know how to develop it.'
