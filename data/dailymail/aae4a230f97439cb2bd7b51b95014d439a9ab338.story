A pair of science enthusiasts are thrilled after successfully launching a homemade probe into outer space - complete with Lego versions of themselves on board.

The tiny toy characters, resembling best friends Jon Chippindall and Ian Cunningham, even got to walk in space as astronaut Jon floated around the Earth’s atmosphere when his strapping became loose.

After setting off from Mold, North Wales last Wednesday, the £250 device named The Manchester Meteor, journeyed to 90,000ft before plunging back down to the ground in a farmer’s field in Chesterfield, Derbys - and the whole journey was caught on camera.

Ian, 29, said: 'Being geeks, we would love to go into space but it’s a little impractical.

'So, we thought we would use Lego men that are little versions of us - Jon’s even has glasses, and they’re dressed like astronauts.

'At one point it all went a bit crazy and Jon’s strapping came loose, meaning his Lego man did a little space-walk in front of the camera!'

Made from only a high-altitude balloon, a payload and an HD camera, The Manchester Meteor enjoyed the high life for around two-and-a-half-hours.

Primary teacher Jon, and Ian tracked its descent from the ground and collected it some 75 miles away from its launchpad.

The intrepid pair, who met while studying aerospace engineering at Manchester University, built the probe in their spare time after retaining a keen interest in space.

The tiny toy characters, attached to the probe ahead of launch, were made to resemble best friends Jon Chippindall and Ian Cunningham

The two Lego characters were launched from Mold, North Wales last Wednesday, on a £250 device named The Manchester Meteor

Ian, an entrepreneur and online technology reviewer, said: 'We wanted to come up with something which was an interesting project that might inspire others.

'It’s basically a balloon with a HD camera attached to it, which we launched to almost 100,000ft.

'We were able to video its journey from take-off to landing, so with the Lego characters on board, it was almost like we were travelling in space.

'When we saw we had reached outer space, we were just amazed. Wow!'

The duo, from Manchester, had to intricately plan where to launch the probe from, taking into consideration weather condition and proximity to any nearby airports.

'We had to wait for a good day, and for a time when we could devote ourselves to doing it,' said Ian.

'We got clearance from the Civil Aviation Authority, who gave us some conditions like not to let it drift, and not to get too close to any airports, for obvious reasons.

'It was very nerve-wrecking and there was a moment where I thought we had lost it, but it went better than expected.'

The probe managed to reach a height of 90,000ft - more than three times the height of Mount Everest. While at this height the probe captured stunning images such as this one

And the two Lego men enjoyed a safe landing, despite rising to heights more than three times the height of Mount Everest.

Jon, 31, said: 'It was really exhiliarating to know that this thing has been to the edge of space and come back down, and that the technology had worked as it was supposed to.

'It was real excitement and relief at the same time. When we launched it, we were a bit despondent for some time thinking it wouldn’t come back - some people release them and never hear from them again.'

Jon now plans to write a guide on making and launching a space camera, which could be used in schools.

He added: 'I’m really, really keen on extra-curricular activities in schools and I think this could really inspire kids to stuffy physics and other sciences.'

The pair will now spend the winter planning their next project.
