James Milner will only sign a new contract at Manchester City if the England midfielder feels he is going to be given a chance to contribute to the club’s success.

Milner has entered the final year of his current deal at the Etihad and is expected to be offered new terms.

But the 28-year-old only started 12 Premier League games as City retained the title last season and may wait to see how prominently he figures in Manuel Pellegrini’s plans.

‘Basically I want to be here - as long as I’m playing,’ said Milner. ‘It’s a great club to be at but you do want to play as much as you can.

‘Hopefully I can be here for a long time to come, but that’s determined by how much football I get. I just want to feel like I’m contributing.

'I played a fair amount last year – maybe not as many in the league as I would have liked – but I felt I contributed to the trophies I won. That’s what it’s about.

‘I think at the end of the season when you win trophies and you haven’t played as much as you wanted it can be frustrating. But that wasn’t the case last year and hopefully it won’t be this either.’
