Sir David Attenborough’s heart-warming encounter with a group of Rwandan gorillas on his Life On Earth show remains one of TV’s most iconic moments.

But the broadcaster’s surprise interaction with the gorillas – who clambered all over him – was almost never captured because of an argument between the film crew over whether it was appropriate for a serious nature documentary.

In an interview on today’s Reunion programme on BBC Radio 4, cameraman Martin Saunders reveals he was nearly stopped from shooting the encounter because producer John Sparks thought it would remind viewers too much of children’s show Animal Magic.

He said: ‘I was arguing with John about filming it because he didn’t want to. He said it was an evolutionary series and it looked too much like Animal Magic.’

Mr Saunders reveals he took it upon himself to begin belatedly filming the 20-minute encounter, below, and managed to get about a ‘minute or so’ worth of footage.

On today’s programme, which reunites the cast and crew of the 1979 series, Sir David recalls  his shock when he realised the whole episode had not been captured  on film.

He said: ‘I saw Martin and John and said that was the most fantastic experience of my life, and John said, “Yep, I think we got a few seconds of it.” I said, “I was there a long time – what do you mean a few seconds?” ’

The scene could have been cut from the show - as producers thought it might not be suitable for a serious wildlife documentary

Sir David had believed until today that Mr Saunders did not have enough film in his camera and was surprised to hear the real reason for the lack of footage.

The cameraman tells him: ‘We were arguing while  you were sitting with those gorillas.’

A clearly surprised Sir David replies: ‘Thanks pal.’
