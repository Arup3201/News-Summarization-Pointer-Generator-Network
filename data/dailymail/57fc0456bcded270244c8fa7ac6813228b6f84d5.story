A member of the New York City Police Department has again been caught possibly using excessive force.

In a video taken on Thursday evening during rush hour at the Myrtle Avenue stop in Brooklyn, an officer can be seen beating 20-year-old Donovan Lawson with his baton, eventually hitting the young man in the head.

The blow to the head is so hard that it actually sprays nearby bystanders with blood.

It all happened shortly before 8pm, as many were making their way home from work, and all because Lawson attempted to get on the subway without paying the fare.

Before he was hit with the baton, Lawson was also pepper sprayed. 

'It was one of the most awful things I’ve ever seen,' Marielle Anas told the Daily News.

'I have blood all over my jeans. The brutality of the nightstick – it was crazy. It looked like his head exploded. I couldn’t believe I was seeing it happen.' 

Anas said she recorded to incident because 'the kid wasn’t doing anything.'

After the beating the young man's girlfriend comforts him, getting blood all over her face and coat. 

Spectators can also be heard pleading with the cop as he wrestles with Lawson even after being struck in the head, screaming 'What are you doing?'

Lawson was later hospitalized for the gash on his head.

He was charged with intent to defraud public transportation, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, harassment and obstruction of governmental administration. 

A source within the NYPD said Lawson has no prior arrests to his name.

This all happened just hours before an innocent man was killed by an officer in the stairwell of a housing project in Brooklyn.

The NYPD Internal Affairs Unit is investigating both incidents.
