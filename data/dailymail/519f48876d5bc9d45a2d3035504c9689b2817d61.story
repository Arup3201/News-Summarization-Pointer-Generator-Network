Impostor: A Facebook picture of the Adelaide teenager shows him wearing a medical uniform including a stethoscope

A teenager who had been audaciously impersonating a doctor at two hospitals in Australia in echoes of the Leonardo Di Caprio movie 'Catch Me If You Can' has been arrested - four months after his ruse began.

The 17-year-old was charged yesterday with administering a prescription drug, aggravated assault and identity theft, after he treated a 12-year-old girl for minor injuries after a scooter accident at Edwardstown on Monday.

But incredibly, it is believed he had wandering the corridors of the Royal Adelaide Hospital in South Australia since October, wearing scrubs, a name badge and a stethoscope, and even reading patient notes.

And while police and hospital chiefs claimed to have known his identity all along, they said they were unable to arrest him because he had not been caught interacting directly with any patients.

There had also been numerous sightings of him on the grounds of Flinders Medical Centre in the city.

And simply playing doctor in hospitals was not enough for the unnamed teen, who had also been seen on city streets offering first aid to the general public.

In December the
state health department circulated a situation report to some 
hospital staff warning them about the 'bogus clinician,' who was 
expelled as a St Johns Ambulance volunteer earlier last year for 
inappropriate behaviour.

The memo said the imposter, who has not been named because of his age, had been spotted on wards at the Royal Adelaide on at least three occasions since October.

Spotted: The teen was recognised on hospital wards at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in South Australia wearing a name badge and a stethoscope, and even reading patient notes

He was reported to be confident, versed 
in medical language and terminology and thus highly plausible unless 
pressed about his identity.

The memo noted that he
has 'not to date committed substantive offences, but should he make 
physical contact with a patient, posing as a clinician, this would 
constitute criminal assault'.

The
Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Authority first warned 
Flinders Medical Centre about his activity in late November and the 
information was subsequently circulated to nursing directors and 
security.

On
that same day a staff member reported seeing him walking away from the 
hospital, wearing scrubs, an FMC lanyard and a stethoscope.

Charlatan: Parallels are being drawn between the teen and conman Frank Abagnale, played by Leonardo Di Caprio in film 'Catch Me If You Can'

The
following day two more reports of possible sightings were made, one 
passing the level two pain clinic and one at the main entrance passing 
admissions.

Because the youth is under the age of 18, he has not been named for legal reasons.

Catch
Me If You Can is a 2002 biographical crime film in which DiCaprio plays
Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed 
cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a pilot, a doctor, and a 
parish prosecutor.
