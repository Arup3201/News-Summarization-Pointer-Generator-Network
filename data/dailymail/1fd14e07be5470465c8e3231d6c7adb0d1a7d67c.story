Keira Knightley has once again been transformed into ‘Coco Mademoiselle’ for Chanel’s latest perfume advert.

She has been the  face of the illustrious French fashion house, starring as its iconic founder Coco Chanel, since 2007 and her newest role is part of a series of mini films that see the mysterious Coco seduce and then mysteriously vanish from devastatingly good looking men.

Set to the song ‘She's not there’ (Rod Argent) performed by The Zombies, and directed by Joe Wright the advert sees Keira dressed in a delicate gown of layered tulle.

Leading man: Russian actor Danila Kozlovsky stars opposite Keira in the advert; here mesmerized as he gazes up at her on the staircase

In her teasing role the actress catches the eye of a well suited young man, played by Russian actor Danila Kozlovsky, as he enters a swinging futuristic party in an all-white room.

Though the cameras turn frantically onto him as he suavely enters the soirée, his attention is quickly drawn to Keira as she descends into the room down one of two huge intersecting staircases.

Looking radiant with her hair in soft shoulder-length waves and smoky eye make-up, she playfully teases – holding out her bottle of Coco Mademoiselle to him  - before playfully snatching it back again.

Dropping the glass perfume bottle, our leading man lunges forward to grab it, only to find that when he turns, Keira is on the other side of the room.

Our final glimpse of Keira is when she is spotted the next day by her admirer as he crosses a bridge.

While Keira has been an exemplary spokesmodel for Chanel - earlier this month attending the Paris Fashion Week show in an optical illusion monochrome dress that garnered much press attention - she admits that she accidentally destroyed her Chanel couture wedding dress.

Confession: Keira pictured on the red carpet in the Chanel couture dress she wore for her wedding, which she admits is now covered in red wine

She wore the dress, which she had in fact worn on the red carpet previously, to wed musician James Righton in France last year, but told Independent Woman that the dress was now ‘destroyed’ after a glass of red wine was spilled down it at a party.

'I didn't quite realise the extent of it until I got home. It's quite impressively splattered,’ the 28-year-old confessed.

‘But, hey, a good night is a good night and when a dress has had its time, maybe it's had its time.

'I'm pretty sure I can get it out but, if I can't, I'm happy with the memory of a good night and the story of how the dress got destroyed.’
