After a recent jaunt to Magaluf, controversial Benefits Street Star White Dee has flown abroad again – this time to try her hand at cooking up French cuisine.

The 42-year-old, who starred in the Channel 4 series as a benefit claimant living off state handouts because she was too depressed to find a job, is currently in Saint-Paul-le-Gaultier, France.

The self-styled ‘dole queen’, whose real name is Deidre Kelly, is working under a top chef at the Chez Maebro bistro as her agent pushes for her to become the 'next Rustie Lee'.

Dee prepared and served a three-course meal, including a classic fish stew, to diners in the restaurant, in what is said to be practice for her own TV cookery show

Having whipped up a fish stew featuring prawns, potato and vegetables, the mother-of-two served her dish to waiting customers at the small bistro.

The restaurant, situated in the small town in north western France, is popular with British tourists and usually serves chips, pizzas, and special kebab platters alongside traditional French fare.

Owner Karen Poulter welcomed White Dee into her restaurant to help prepare the Benefits Street star for having her own cookery show – which is said to be in the making.

The 41-year-old, said: ‘We were really surprised at how good a cook Dee was.

‘After reading that she has a love of food and an interest in owning her own restaurant in the future, this was a good opportunity for her to see herself in the kitchen.

‘All the locals we had in on the night loved the food and her company.’

Her agent Barry Tomes revealed she had been offered to host a show which will follow her teaching Brits how to cook on a tight budget. The show - if given the go ahead - could land her £20,000 for a six episode run

Dee prepared and served the three-course meal to diners celebrating a private 80th birthday party, in what is said to be practice for her own TV cookery show.

Her agent Barry Tomes revealed last month she had been offered to host a show which will follow her teaching Brits how to cook on a tight budget.

The show - if given the go ahead - could land her £20,000 for a six episode run, he said.

Mr Tomes said her visit to France is her first time in a professional kitchen ahead of her bid to become the 'next Rustie Lee'.

TV chef Rustie became famous for her loud and outgoing style on her appearances in the 1980s breakfast show TV-am, and later had her own cooking programme.

The Birmingham mother-of-two, who is rumoured to have had some of her benefits frozen after it emerged she was being paid to do promotional work, has been receiving around £20,000 a year in welfare payments.

The single mother angered taxpayers after insisting she would continue claiming handouts until the Government stops her.

Last month it was also reported she had turned down four job opportunities, claiming they were 'too boring' among other excuses.

After being given trial runs at four potential careers near her home in Birmingham, she declined to pursue any of them.

She is reportedly receiving £214 a week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance - formerly known as incapacity benefit - child tax credit and child benefit, plus £500 a month in housing benefit.

Dee said she does feel guilty about claiming handouts, maintaining it is her depression that has stopped her from taking on full-time roles.

A decision on whether her benefits will be withdrawn is expected to be announced in July.

Mr Tomes said that the Department for Work and Pensions had requested an earlier meeting with the television star, but said she was unable to make it as it coincided with a public appearance at a pool party in Magaluf.

After repeatedly claiming that she is too depressed to work, Dee claimed her Magaluf trip in May was a pick-me-up for which she was not paid.
