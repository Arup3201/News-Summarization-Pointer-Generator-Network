Croatia legend Robert Prosinecki has warned former club Dinamo Zagreb it would foolish to underestimate Celtic after detecting hints of complacency in his homeland.

The Parkhead outfit’s two Champions League exits to Legia Warsaw and Maribor have convinced some in the Croatian media that Ronny Deila’s men are there for the taking in Glasgow on Thursday.

But ex-Real Madrid and Barcelona playmaker Prosinecki pointed out that Dinamo are a shadow of the side they were in his 1990s heyday - and believes Celtic will be formidable opponents as they seek the victory he feels will leave them on the cusp of qualifying for the knockout stages of the Europa League.

‘I keep reading stories in Croatia that Celtic are weak these days just because of what happened against Legia Warsaw and because Maribor beat them,’ said the 45-year-old, part of a Dinamo team who lost 1-0 to Celtic in a Champions League qualifier in 1998 but went on to crush them 3-0 in Zagreb.

‘They are not - and Dinamo don’t have the same standard as team as when we last played Celtic.

‘If Celtic’s stadium is close to being full, it will be a very, very tough night for Dinamo.

‘Celtic took a point in Austria against Salzburg and they know if they can win, this will be a key outcome for them. It will almost guarantee their qualification.’

The former Yugoslavia and Croatia midfielder, who had two spells with Dinamo before managing Red Star Belgrade, recalled his own trip to Parkhead, saying: ‘We lost 1-0 in Glasgow. We were the better team and missed two great chances, but in football the better team doesn’t always win.

‘But after that game we were very confident of beating them and we were spectacular in Zagreb.

‘We justified our self-confidence and absolutely overran them. The Maksimir Stadium was full and the atmosphere was incredible. It was a great night.

‘The final stats were 24 shots to three in our favour. We were a really good team.

“But it’s hard to win at Celtic Park and Dinamo had better not underestimate the Scots. They must not think this will be easy. However, if they can come away from Glasgow undefeated, they have a great chance of remaining in Europe after Christmas for the first time.’

Meanwhile, Police Scotland are investigating an allegation by Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk that he was racially abused by a fan during his side’s 2-1 win at St Mirren on Saturday.

A statement from Police Scotland read: ‘We have received a complaint from a Celtic player alleging he was racially abused by a spectator during the St Mirren v Celtic match on Saturday. Police are liaising with both clubs and are analysing broadcast and CCTV footage. Enquiries are ongoing.’

St Mirren last night pledged to co-operate in any police investigation but the club declined to comment further.

In a separate matter, the SFA have confirmed that a principal hearing into allegations that Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev used racist language during a game against Aberdeen earlier this month has been rescheduled for October 30 because of his inclusion in the Bulgarian international squad for European qualifiers against Croatia and Norway
