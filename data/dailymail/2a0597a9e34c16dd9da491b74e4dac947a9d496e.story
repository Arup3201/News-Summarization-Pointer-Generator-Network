Migaloo the albino whale has become somewhat of a celebrity on the east coast of New South Wales, with whale-watchers and tourists alike trying to catch a glimpse of the unique animal as he migrates north.

However, there are fears that the majestic beast may in be in danger of health problems because of the pale colour of his skin.

Red marks have been spotted on the humpback whale's dorsal fin and Whale expert Professor Peter Harrison from Southern Cross University told the ABC he is keen to look at recent photos to determine the cause.

There are concerns Migaloo the humpback whale may be suffering from skin cancer due to his pale colour

He has examined some images taken of Migaloo off Cape Byron this week, and said some questions have been raised about whether Migaloo may be suffering from skin cancer.

'It will be very interesting to see whether or not this redness has disappeared, or whether or not it has obviously become more inflamed which would indicate some sort of infection and I guess there is a possibility that it might be early stages of cancer as well,' Professor Harrison said.

'Most people are curious as to whether or not this might be a preliminary form of skin cancer, but at this stage of course we simply can't tell.'

The albino whale is one of only two in the world, the other is believed to be Norwegian

Experts say the red marks spotted on Migaloo could also be due to a collision with something during his migration

Professor Harrison also said there is some scratching and dicolouration in the same area, so there's a possibility he could have collided with something during his journey up Australia.

Last week, an Australian photographer who had been trying to capture images of the albino humpback for nine years when his hard work paid off while whale-watching north of Newcastle.

Veteran photographer Ray Alley managed to get some stunning pictures of Migaloo off the coast of Nelson Bay in NSW. The all-white Migaloo stopped off for a rare display of showmanship on his way through at Nelson Bay.

Still getting over the shock of this amazing image, he told Daily Mail Australia today was the 'holy grail' in his 27-year photographic career:

The rare humpback was spotted in Cronulla, Sydney, earlier this month, putting on a show for photographers and onlookers

Migaloo was swimming in a 'competition pod' with four other Humpback whales as they tried to jostle one another for the leading position while heading north through Sydney earlier this month

Migaloo was seen off the Gold Coast near South Stradbroke Island in September 2012

'I expected to see him today, because I got the call from one of the guys at Imagine cruises saying 'we've got him'. But to get a full breach, it's kind of like seeing Madonna drop her gear on stage, you really want it to happen but you don't expect it too.'

Migaloo shares his distinguishable albino appearance with just one other white whale in the world, a Norwegian. He was first sighted for the first time this year by a member of the public just off the coast of Green Cape in southern NSW on Tuesday.

It is the 23rd consecutive year Migaloo has been spotted on the eastern seaboard, his first being in 1991 when he was sighted by marine biologist Dan Burns off the coast off Byron Bay. By Friday he will have made his way north of Newcastle, before reaching Queensland at the end of the month.

He is being joined by others from the Australian East Coast Humpback whale population, leaving the cool waters of the Antarctic behind in search of Queensland's tropical warm paradise.

The white whale has been seen at various points during his migration this year including against the backdrop of the Sydney skyline
