Pictures of Rooney have surfaced showing the striker out into the early hours of the morning

Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has been left red-faced after new footage was released of the England international out at a bar, contradicting the striker's own claims that he was at home in bed.

In the snap, Rooney is seen together with team-mate Jonny Evans at Tony McGee's establishment in The Vincent Hotel in Southport.

Along with Darren Gibson, the trio were all out celebrating United's 5-1 win on Boxing Day against Wigan, but Rooney's camp later insisted that the striker had returned home following a timid outing together with his wife Coleen.

The striker was fined Â£200,000 by his club after boss Sir Alex Ferguson suggested that the forward had been below par in training in the build-up to United's New Year's Eve 3-2 home defeat against Blackburn Rovers.

However the Hotel's manager Paul Adams has reaffirmed Rooney's claim that he was in bed by 12.30am telling The Mirror; 'Wayne went to bed shortly after midnight, about 12.30am.

'He was not drunk, he was just having a quiet evening with friends.'

Whilst phone records of the picture show it was taken at 2.12am, a spokesman for the striker insisted that it was captured at the wrong time.

However the mobile's makers BlackBerry are adamant that any photograph captured on a handset would 'automatically have the correct date and time.'

Suggestions that relations 
between Rooney and Ferguson are strained were denied by the club yesterday, after it emerged that Ferguson is considering the possibility of sanctioning 
the sale of his star forward.

Rooney took to Twitter to refute the rumours, saying: 'The independent are talking absolute rubbish, my future is with Manchester United and the club and I am totally committed, the manager and I have no issues and anyone who says different doesn't know what they are talking about.'

Meanwhile the Old Trafford club released a statement denying the 26-year-old's relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson is strained.

'Manchester United and Wayne Rooney have been made aware of the theme of an article in tomorrow's Independent newspaper," said the statement.

'We have not seen the detail but can assure all United fans that the manager and the club are committed to Wayne Rooney and Wayne is committed to the manager and the club.

'The player and the manager have always had and retain, the utmost respect for each other and look forward to working together in the coming seasons.

'Any suggestion that Manchester United and Wayne Rooney are to part company is complete nonsense.'
