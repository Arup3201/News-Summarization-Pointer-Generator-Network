Some might say Gary Neville is a huge Oasis fan, but there's a possibility he'll be looking back in anger at a moment he shared with Noel Gallagher.

Former Manchester United defender Neville has previously explained his love for Oasis - a band whose music will surely live forever - but the Sky Sports pundit got more than he bargained for when he asked Gallagher to sign one of his guitars.

An avid Manchester City fan, Gallagher jumped on the opportunity, returning it covered in abuse and 'MCFC' scribbles.

Gary Neville posted a picture of his defaced guitar, signed by Noel Gallagher with a personalised message 

On the front of the guitar, Gallagher had scribbed ' MCFC' four times around the outside 

But only now has Neville revealed photographic evidence of the exact message written by Gallagher.

'Dear Gary,' the guitar reads. 'How many caps have you got for England!! How many have you deserved?? I'll tell you... F****** NONE!! Lots of love, Noel Gallagher x M.C.F.C.'

Neville could be forgiven for crying his heart out at such a scathing attack from one of his heroes.

Neville, since retiring from professional football, has forged a successful commentary and punditry career

He previously admitted to Digital Spy that he loves Oasis, but should have known what to expect from City-supporting Gallagher.

'I was a big Oasis fan', Neville said. 'I started learning the guitar for a few years and just sent it (to) him one day. I got it back with that! Shouldn't have been surprised, really!' 

Neville has tipped Chelsea to definitely win the league, but maybe Man City can catch them. If so, Gallagher is sure to be in a Champagne Supernova.

Gallagher will be hoping Man City can claw back the Premier League title
