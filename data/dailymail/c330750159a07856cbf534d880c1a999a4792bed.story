If you have a sweet tooth would you pay nearly £50,000 to satisfy it?

One company is offering the 'world’s most precious' gingerbread house for the pricey sum. It's adorned with 150 pearls and has five carat rubies set within the icing.

The house can be totally bespoke and even created in the likeness of your own home.

Sweet treat: One company is offering the 'world's most precious' gingerbread house, adorned with 150 pearls and five carat rubies - but it will set you back nearly £50,000 (picture shows an example, the actual design will be based on the purchaser's own home)

So what makes the £49,750 house so special? The house is apparently crafted using the finest ingredients including organic ginger, Ceylon Cinnamon (prized for its health-boosting properties), Duchy organic eggs (the organic brand founded by Prince Charles) and Suma raw cane sugar.

The house is created by Cordon Bleu trained Georgia Green, the owner of Georgia’s Cakes.

Her culinary creations frequently attract attention. She recently enjoyed global exposure for her jacket shaped cake commissioned to celebrate the launch of Cara Delevingne’s collection for DKNY.

Embellished: The house is adorned with South Sea Pearls and a five carat unheated Mozambique Ruby set within the icing - extra pearls can be added if you so wish

Oh, and if you're not satisfied with the decadent 65cm by 35cm by 45cm creation, you can add even more pearls at an added cost.

Marcel Knobil, founder of VeryFirstTo, Superbrands and Cool BrandLeaders, who is selling the treat, said: 'This deliciously decadent house is the perfect centrepiece of any Christmas table. 

'Not only is it created by Georgia, a baker to the stars, but the gems are an excellent investment and remain long after the gingerbread has been devoured.'

Georgia Green added: 'I am so excited to be creating this incredibly precious never done before culinary innovation. I love working with gingerbread and the gems just add such a cool element.' 

A donation of £1,000 will be made to The Prince’s Trust charity should the house be purchased.
