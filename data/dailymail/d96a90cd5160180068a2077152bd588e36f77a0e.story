Confused council officials stormed a village pub thinking they were busting an illegal late-night gig - only to realise 4AM was the name of the band, not the starting time.

Three licensing officers and two police officers raided The Feathers, in the sleepy Surrey village of Laleham, after spotting an advert promising ‘music from 4am’.

The name of the band - billed as a two-piece soul funk combo - led bungling council inspectors to assume the pub gig would kick off at 4am, and they lay in wait to raid the pub before striking just after 10pm.

Kate Dillon, landlady of The Feathers, said she was ‘amazed’ at the ‘sting’ operation - saying it was unbelievable that two police officers were called in to back up the three licensing staff from Spelthorne Borough Council.

She said it was like ‘using a sledgehammer to crack a nut’, adding: 'They turned up with two police officers and three council officers.

'I was outside at the time collecting glasses (and) I came into the pub and said: "What on earth is this all about?".

'They wanted to know if there was going to be music on until 4am and I was absolutely speechless for the first time in my life.

'I’m too old to stay up that late.'

The duo, named 4am after a song by jazz legend Herbie Hancock, is made up of singer John Adams and drummer Joe Becket.

Mr Adams said everyone was ‘very confused’ about the raid, adding: 'This has never happened to us before.

'We’re called 4am after one of our favourite tracks by Herbie Hancock. That’s how we got the name, it’s from the album Mr Hands.

'When we were looking for a name that was our favourite album. We play stuff to get the ladies dancing, it’s all dance and soul.'

Simon Freeman, 32, was at the gig when the raid took place - and said it was ‘totally ridiculous’.

He said: 'These two police officers came in with these three guys from the council and they were very confrontational.

'You should have seen their faces when they realised the name of the band was 4am, not the time of the gig - they shot off with their tails between their legs.

'It will take quite a while for them to live this one down.'

A spokesman for Spelthorne Borough Council admitted yesterday that its officers had made an error after spotting a poster for the gig earlier this month.

He said: 'Following a visit to The Feathers, there was no cause for concern. The visit was carried out after seeing an advertisement which mentioned 4am.

'On investigation, this was part of the name of the band.'
