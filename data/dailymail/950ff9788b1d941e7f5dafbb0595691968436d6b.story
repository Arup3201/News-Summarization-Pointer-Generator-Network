A 20-year-old student has been charged with setting fire to a classmate in his dorm then singing as he filmed her waking up engulfed in flames.

Jaime Castano is said to have admitted to police that he took a video on his phone showing his drunk victim asleep in his bed as flames licked across her body.

According to court papers, the video showed Castano singing as the 19-year-old woke up in agony and desperately tried to put out the blaze which had spread across her body.

Charges: Former New York University student Jaime Castano has been charged with setting fire to a fellow student who fell asleep in his dorm room, then filmed and sang along to the moment she woke up in flames

The teenager suffered 'painful burns and scarring to her torso', it was alleged in a criminal complaint seen by the New York Daily News.

Castano was arraigned yesterday on charges of assault and reckless endangerment in connection with the incident last August. He was held on a bond of £50,000 or $25,000 cash bail.

The victim, a fellow student of Castano's at New York University, claims she and a third person were with Castano at his dorm room on Lafayette Street when she fell asleep at about 11pm on August 23, CBS New York reported.

At around 6am the following the morning she woke to find holes and burn marks on her bed and blankets, burns on her clothes, and painful burns on her body, prosecutors told the broadcaster.

But she wasn't aware of what caused the fire until she saw Castano's video, which he had shared with the photo-messaging application Snapchat, it is claimed.

The victim reported the attack to university officials but they did not alert police until October 27 - more than two months after it allegedly occurred.

An NYU spokesman would not comment on the delay when asked by the the New York Daily News, but did tell the paper that Castano was expelled in September over the alleged attack.

The victim's identity has not been made public. Castano is due back on court on Friday to learn if he has been indicted.
