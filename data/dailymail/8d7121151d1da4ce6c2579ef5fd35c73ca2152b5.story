A Monaco prince has claimed that a bar-room brawl left him unable to work or a month.

Prince Pierre Casiraghi, the son of Princess Caroline and grandson of Grace Kelly, was allegedly punched in the face after sparking a row with a stranger in a swanky New York nightclub.

Witnesses claim that Prince Pierre was 'jealous' of Adam Hock because he was sitting with a woman that the Prince was interested in.

Prince Pierre and his entourage, who were drinking £350 bottles of champagne, are said to have gone over to Hock’s table and started behaving ‘obnoxiously’.

Hock allegedly punched Pierre and sent him flying into a table on the other side of the room, where he landed with blood pouring from his face. ‘Pierre’s face looked broken, with deep cuts and blood everywhere,’ said one witness. ‘He looked like he needed plastic surgery.’

Hock, 47, was arrested and charged with four counts of assault against the Prince and three of his friends.

Hock denies the charges.

Yesterday the prince presented a letter to Manhattan Criminal Court from his royal physicians claiming the brawl had left him so badly injured that he was unable to work for a month.

Defence lawyer Joseph Tacopina told the court that when treating Prince Pierre after the fight doctors at New York Presbyterian Hospital described the prince as suffering a 'superficial' skin laceration.

Accustomed to wealth, fame and power Casiraghi was said to be 'jealous' of Hock

But seven days later the royal got a second opinion from his personal doctors who diagnosed him with 'face trauma'.

Speaking outside court Prince Pierre's lawyer Edward Kratt said: 'I know what the read deal is. The injury was serious.'

Hock claims that he was the victim of a four-against-one scuffle with 'international bar brawlers'.

He is accused of assaulting Prince Pierre, his friends Diego Marroquin, Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld and Paris Hilton's ex-boyfriend Stravros Niarchos.

Mr Tacopina said: 'We have evidence of these guys acting out in Brazil, Belize and Paris. What happened that night happens all the time. They think mom and dad will dig them out of whatever trouble they get in."

The case continues.
