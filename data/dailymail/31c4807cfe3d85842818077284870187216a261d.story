Embattled former IRS official Lois Lerner is on two different hot seats this week, as a pair of Republican-led congressional committees aim to prosecute her for her role in a scheme to target conservative groups in the middle of an election campaign season.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will convene a hearing on Thursday to consider a motion holding Lerner in contempt of Congress, the first step toward a possible criminal prosecution.

A contempt resolution, if the House should approve it, could also help persuade a federal court to compel Lerner to testify about her role in what has become known as the tea party targeting scandal.

Lerner has pleaded the Fifth Amendment twice in House Oversight hearings, refusing to answer questions. But committee Republicans led a party-line effort to declare that she had waived that right in a 2013 hearing by offering a self-serving opening statement and claiming that she had done nothing wrong.

Between a rock and a hard place: House Speaker John Boehner recalled in an Fox news interview on Monday that he never cared about Lois Lerner's firing, but wants to know 'Who's going to jail?'

Cat, meet canary: House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa aims to hold Lerner in contempt, a necessary step before the Justice Department can prosecute her or a federal judge can force her to testify in an open hearing

Lerner (R) was sworn in twice before the Oversight committee but refused to answer questions despite offering a lengthy opening statement insisting she did nothing wrong

House Speaker John Boehner told a Fox News audience on Monday night that the full Congress 'will take up that contempt
 resolution.'

'If she's not going to tell us the truth, we are going to hold her in contempt.'

On Wednesday the House Ways and Means committee will consider its own response to Lerner's silence.

Members will 'mark up' a letter directing Attorney General Eric Holder to prosecute her 'for violations of one or more criminal statutes based on evidence the Committee has uncovered in the course of the investigation of IRS abuses.'

Since the letter contains confidential tax information about the conservative groups the IRS targeted, the meeting will take place away from public view. The Internal Revenue Code prohibits the disclosure of that information.

Getting Holder to prosecute Lerner could be a tough sell, since hse has already met in secret with Justice Department investigators. House Republicans claim that in those meetings she addressed details of her work that she refused to talk about in open hearings.

Until her resignation in disgrace last year, Lerner headed the IRS's Exempt Organizations division, an office tasked with vetting and monitoring nonprofit groups whose purpose entitles them to an exemption from paying federal income taxes.

For more than three years, evidence shows, that office played political favorites by quickly approving politically liberal groups while it slow-walked applications form tea party groups and other conservative-minded organizations.

House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dave Camp is retiring next year but wants to end his career by seeing Lerner prosecuted; his committee will hash out a letter on Wednesday demanding Attorney General Eric Holder bring charges

Loyal opposition: Liberal firebrand Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democratic congressman, has defended Lerner by saying she has a right to keep the House of Representatives in the dark

Oversight committee Democrats, led by Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummmings, claim that some progressive groups' approvals for special tax status were also delayed. But California Rep. Darrell Issa, a Californian who chairs the committee, issued a scathing report this week disputing that claim.

Hundreds of right-wing groups were targeted, often with lengthy intrusive questionnaires that liberal organizations never saw. The IRS's demands included lists of donors and program participants, including minors; information about prayers offered at meetings; exhaustive lists of comments left on Facebook posts; and names of volunteers.

Boehner recalled Monday night that when the scandal first broke, he told reporters that 'I don't care who's going to be fired' over the IRS fiasco. 'I want to know who's going to jail.'

'Somebody at the IRS violated the law.'

'We know that Ms. Lerner gave up her right to plead the Fifth,' he said. 'She refused to testify – and she testified and spoke with the prosecutors of the Justice Department. I don't know why she wouldn’t talk to the Congress and to the American people.'

Boehner also hinted that officials other than Lerner could face legal jeopardy.

Lerner could go to jail for misleading Congress and for abuse of power. Even if AG Eric Holder refuses to prosecute, a judge could force her to testify
