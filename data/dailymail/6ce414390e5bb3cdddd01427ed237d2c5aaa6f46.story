The social media craze for 'neknominating' has reached a new high with a video showing two men quaffing beers while hanging from a helicopter.

The footage uploaded to YouTube shows the pair clutching the skids of a helicopter while downing a bottle of VB each as it hovers several dozen feet above a lake.

Neither man is wearing a safety harness and only one is wearing a helmet, which is apparently so that he can mount a camera rather than out of any safety considerations.

It is the wildest 'neknomination' video yet seen after the social media drinking game emerged. The fad encourages participants to film themselves 'necking’ liquor, then nominate a friend to do the same.

They then try to outdo each other creating more extreme, disgusting and outlandish videos. Those who refuse to participate risk losing face among their peers.

The new video begins with two young men driving in a Ferrari somewhere in the outback and explaining that they have been nominated.

They arrive at a farm, where they leap from the sports car and run to a waiting helicopter that is already hovering several feet above the ground.

Grabbing hold of its skids, they hang on for dear life as it lifts then into the air and carries them to a nearby lake where a person aboard the aircraft hands them each a bottle of Victoria Bitter.

Each man then holds on with just one arm as they both down the bottles of Australian-brewed beer.

Finally, they let go of the helicopter and plunge into the waters below.

The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world, however it seems to have recently found a large following amoung young males in Australia. 

The concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a dick. The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink Responsible'.

One popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain bowl to lap it up.

Another video shows a young man get punched, beaten with sticks, have firecrackers thrown at him and his pants set alight, as he guzzles beers and shots.

A third shows a group of apres-ski partygoers downing beers that have first been poured into someone's sweaty ski boot.

The trend has reached the apres-ski scene in St Anton, where legendary bar the Krazy Kanguruh sees partygoers like 'Charlo', pictured, remove a ski boot and use it to down pints of beer

The boot - or 'Das Boot' as it is fondly called - is passed around the group who then have to down the increasingly foul liquid

But the competitive nature of the game
 has authorities worried as nominees are encouraged to go further and be
 more extreme in their videos.

Director
 of the University of NSW's National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, 
Professor Michael Farrell, has expressed his concern on the trend saying
 it could turn deadly.

‘It's like Jackass and that type of wild behaviour, and it's not necessarily very impressive,’ he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

‘The
 main issue is the question of scale and context. In general it looks 
like it could get people into a lot of trouble, with a lot of pressure 
to drink. It's competitive, heavy drinking, and that tends to end up 
with people coming to serious grief through alcohol poisoning. It isn't a
 thing to be encouraged at all,’ he said.

Police
 in Australia have questioned a 21-year-old man after a video showed him
 getting out of the boot of a car, downing a drink, then climbing back 
in.

Another trend concerning
 authorities is ‘skidnominate’, a dangerous escalation of the drinking 
game where participants film themselves doing burnouts and skids in 
their cars.
