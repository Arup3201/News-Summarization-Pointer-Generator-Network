After three 'reem' years 
of vajazzles, make-ups and break-ups on TOWIE, Sam Faiers left the ITV2 show that rocketed her to fame in April.

Since then, she has been snapped up by countless beauty brands, seen Minnie's Boutique - the shop she owns with her sister - become a success and even landed herself a top modelling contract.

FEMAIL caught up with Sam to find out 
her beauty secrets, summer style tips and plans for the future - which 
is most certainly looking bright.

New identity? Sam Faiers, who found fame on TOWIE, has just released her debut fragrance and penned her name as 'Samantha' on the bottle

The 23-year-old's most recent project has seen her launch her debut fragrance, La Bella, and she's keen to be taken more seriously.

Speaking about her new perfume, which has vanilla and caramel tones, she told MailOnline: 'I was a real girly girl growing up and my fragrance reflects that. I had an image of how I wanted it to look and I was involved in every step of creating it so it is everything I dreamed of.'

Sam, as she has always been known, has also made a bold statement with her debut fragrance. 'I was always known as "Sam from TOWIE and Big Brother" and as much as I've been happy with that, I also really love classy and elegant stuff so I have written "By Samantha" on the bottle. It sounds nicer,' she explained.

While her The Only Way Is Essex friends are living it up in Marbella, Sam reveals that she won't be joining the party. 

Dream come true: Speaking about her new perfume, which is full of vanilla and caramel tones, she told MailOnline: 'I had an image of how I wanted it to look and I was involved in every step of creating it so it is everything I dreamed of'

'This summer I have lots of holidays planned. I might go to Marbella to visit my nan and grandad but I definitely won't be going to any crazy parties. I am also heading to Ibiza with Joey and the girls and to Spain with Billie and her baby.

'I am also planning on going to Dubai with the family and Joey and I want to go on an exotic holiday really far away when we have time in our busy schedules,' she said of her and her boyfriend's plans.

Sharing her summer style tips, Sam said: 'I think you can be more daring on holiday. I'm loving pastel colours, crop tops and little dainty pieces of jewellery.'

Chiming in on Bobby Norris and Harry Derbidge's questionable half thong swimming trunks that have shocked the nation, Sam said: 'How hysterical are those! I didn't think it was actually a thing and I would never like to see Joey wearing one but they can half get away with it and, you know, only in TOWIE hey!'.

When it comes to beachside beauty, Sam says she loves to keep in natural and 'doesn't wear a scrap of make-up' in the day and loves to 'scruff her hair into a bun'.

With a manic schedule, Sam says she hasn't had time to work out 'as much as she'd like to' but says that when she does exercise, she focuses on toning and not cardio.

'I don't have a lot of weight to shed so I just do lots of lunges, squats and use kettle bells,' she explained.

As for the future, Sam says she has 'loads of things' going on. She told us: 'I have lots of exciting things planned with my modelling agency, Elite, for the summer, and have been talking to some TV companies but I'll make sure I choose the right thing for me.'
