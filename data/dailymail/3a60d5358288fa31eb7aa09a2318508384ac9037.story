According to a report in Germany, Bayern Munich want a refund on new signing Mehdi Benatia, because he doesn't speak any Spanish.

It was satire, of course. With their current problems at the back, Bayern are over the moon to finally have Benatia among their ranks. But the joke captures the feeling in Bavaria that Bayern are becoming increasingly hispanic.

This has been a Spanish summer for Bayern in the transfer market. Pepe Reina has been drafted in as a reserve goalkeeper, Juan Bernat was signed from Valencia, and Xabi Alonso has completed a move to the German champions. On top of that, Bayern have also shown interest in Athletic Bilbao's Ander Iturraspe.

That's not to mention the Spaniards who were already in the Bayern squad. Part of the reason for Bayern's interest in the aforementioned players are the injuries to Thiago Alcantara and Javi Martinez.

Martinez, of course, was signed by former coach Jupp Heynckes, himself a connoisseur of Spanish football. The rest, most notably Thiago, are products of the Guardiola era. An era which many are now concerned is too Spanish influenced.

Bayern legend Lothar Matthaus claimed last May that Guardiola 'doesn't understand the German football mentality', while a Spanish journalist recently wrote in the Munich tabloid TZ that the club are 'in danger of losing their identity'. Even Bernat, one of Bayern's new Spaniards, warned that 'a Spanish faction in the squad would be dangerous'.

The criticism is a little unfair. Guardiola may have signed a host of Spanish players, and even brought two former Barcelona colleagues into his coaching staff, but the vast majority of his entourage remains German. He has also continued to build around key German players such as Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Muller and Manuel Neuer. In face of a defensive catastrophe, he has put his faith in Holger Badstuber, a homegrown player who has just returned from nearly two years of injury.

As for Bayern's identity, Guardiola is arguably just continuing a tradition which Bayern have upheld since rising to dominance in the 70s. Reinforcement in Munich always arrives through a mixture of financial muscle and a strong youth system. Guardiola's Spanish-focused activity in the transfer market must be seen in the context of his close work with the Bayern youth system. That work has borne fruit in recent months with the emergence into the first team of youngsters Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Gianluca Gaudino.

When it comes to the transfer market, though, there is no denying Guardiola's penchant for Spain above all else. The departure of German World Cup hero Toni Kroos is a classic example. Though Guardiola did not want to lose the player, his solution to the problem came in the form of a Spaniard, Bernat. The signing from Valencia will now play at left back, with the versatile Austrian David Alaba being redeployed in midfield to fill the gap left by Kroos.

Even aside from personnel, though, there are worries that Guardiola's approach is still too Spanish. Honorary president Franz Beckenbauer voiced concerns last spring that Guardiola's tactical philosophy didn't suit Bayern.

Critic: Franz Beckenbauer is not a fan of tiki-taka 

'They play like Barcelona, where even standing on the goal-line they play the ball backwards' Beckenbauer moaned on Sky TV.

The comment provoked an indignant defence from Guardiola at the time, but details have since emerged that he is responsive to that criticism, and is keen to show Bayern are not simply a remodelled Barcelona. In pre-release extracts from a new biography, Guardiola is quoted saying 'I hate tiki-taka'.

'Tiki-taka is when you play the ball only in order to play it again. This doesn't interest us. What we need is the central midfielders and the defence to be aggressive going forward and to break the opposing ranks. We need to keep the ball on one side, so as to free space to attack on the other. That is our game. Not this pointless tiki-taka.'

The 'pointless' version of tiki-taka is often what Bayern were caught playing last season. With Robert Lewandowski now added to their ranks, Guardiola will hope that his attack has more of a cutting edge this season.

Guardiola is walking a tightrope, and adapting himself to a new football culture. He speaks passable German already, but the next stage is much more difficult. The next stage is to ensure his style can be as German as it is Spanish; a style of tiki-taka focused on the goal, or to use the German word, the Tor. It is, as Bild put it on Thursday, a case of Tik-Tak-Tor
