Babies born using a new technique to eradicate serious illness would never get to know one of their parents, it has emerged.

The Government is pushing for the law to be changed to allow families blighted by incurable disease to have healthy children.

It would make Britain the first country in the world to sanction the creation of babies that effectively have three parents – two mothers and a father.

However the genetic contribution from the second mother would be tiny – just 0.1 per cent – and so the Government has said her identity should be kept secret.

This differs from laws covering children born from sperm and eggs donated for regular IVF treatment, who can find out the donor’s identity when they turn 18.

Supporters say the legislation would allow those living in the shadow of incurable disease the chance to have a healthy child.

But critics argue that genetically engineering eggs crosses a critical ethical line, and are concerned about the impact of children not knowing who their third parent is.

Philippa Taylor, of the Christian Medical Fellowship, said: ‘A child must have the right to identify and know who his or her three genetic parents are, if they choose.

'This is already granted to children who are adopted because we understand how important it is for children to know about their genetic heritage for their sense of identity and self-understanding. It should not be denied to these children.’

However Robert Meadowcroft, of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, said the technique ‘involves a calculated step into new scientific territory, but it is a very focused step, with the sole aim of preventing a potentially fatal condition from being passed down where possible.’

He added that it would open up the ‘possibility of motherhood’ to women afraid of passing on a painful and debilitating condition.

The technique, being perfected at Newcastle University, involves trying to prevent disease caused by faults in mitochondria, which cause serious illness in one in 6,500 babies.

Scientists have found a way of swapping the mother-to-be’s diseased mitochondria with healthy ones donated by another woman.

The technique involves removing the nucleus DNA from a fertilised egg, and inserting it into a donor egg where the nucleus DNA has been removed.

The resulting embryo would end up with the nucleus DNA from its parents - making up the vast majority - but the mitochondrial DNA from the donor, amounting to around 0.1 per cent.

The proposed change in the law was announced by Public Health Minister Jane Ellison. It will have to be debated and voted on in both Houses but could be passed by the end of January. However, it would not become law until October.

The Newcastle team say they are delighted that Parliament is to consider the legislation and say they will soon be ready to treat couples.
