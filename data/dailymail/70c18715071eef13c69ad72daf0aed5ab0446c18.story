Victim: Lay preacher Alan Greaves was killed as he made his way to play the organ at midnight mass on Christmas Eve

A man accused of murdering a church organist on Christmas Eve has told a jury how he was frightened of his co-accused who has already admitted the killing.

Ashley Foster, 22, told the jury at Sheffield Crown Court today that he was afraid he was going to be beaten up by Jonathan Bowling, also 22, when he brandished a pick-axe handle as the pair went for a walk on December 24 last year.

He told jurors how he tried to calm Bowling down after he threatened to kill another man during a row earlier the same evening.

Foster is accused of battering 68-year-old Alan Greaves to death as the organist walked from his home to play at midnight mass at St Saviour's Church in the High Green area of Sheffield.

Bowling has already admitted murdering the grandfather, but prosecutors allege Foster also took part in the attack.

Foster gave evidence today supported by an intermediary. At times he was barely audible in the courtroom and he was frequently asked to repeat his answers to questions from his barrister, Adrian Waterman QC, so the judge and jury could hear them.

Foster told the jury how he had known Bowling since he was about 13 years old, when his mother was involved in a relationship with Bowling’s father, Leslie.

He told the jury how Leslie Bowling often beat him up and tried to kill his mother. He said the violence was such that his mother was given a new name and the family moved to Cornwall for a time.

Father-of-two Foster told the jury how Bowling had also beaten him up - once because his dad had given him £50 to do it.

He said his family returned from Cornwall and Bowling would come around to his house, despite him not wanting him to.

Battered: Mr Greaves sustained 'grave and catastrophic head injuries in the attack, and he died in hospital three days later

'I was scared of telling him to go away,' Foster said.

'Scared of him trying to beat everyone up in my house and beat me up.'

Foster told the jury how he and Bowling went walking around High Green on Christmas Eve last year.

He said he was trying to calm the other man down after an argument in which he had threatened to kill someone they had been with earlier.

Foster said that at one point during their walk Bowling went off for a moment and came back with a pick-axe. He said he knocked the head off it, leaving just the handle.

He said: 'I thought he was going to beat me up with it.

'I thought he was going to beat me up there.'

Foster described how he had drunk one Budweiser at a family gathering before the two men went, out but admitted he had smoked cannabis.

The jury has heard that Mr Greaves sustained 'grave and catastrophic head injuries in the attack, and he died in hospital three days later.

Prosecutors say he was hit with a pick-axe handle and another weapon, possibly a hammer.

Foster denies one count of murder.

The jury has been told that Bowling, from the Pitsmoor area of Sheffield, has already admitted murdering Mr Greaves.

Mr Greaves’s widow, Maureen, watched Foster give evidence from the public gallery today, along with other members of her family.

The trial continues.
