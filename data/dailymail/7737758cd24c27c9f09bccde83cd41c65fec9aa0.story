An apartment block which collapsed in North Korea earlier this week may have killed more than 400 people, it was claimed today.

The reported death toll was far higher than the scores or 'more than one hundred' who were said earlier to have died when the high rise building crashed down as a result of poor workmanship.

A satellite photograph released today shows the building in the capital, Pyongyang, which is thought to have housed a large number of elite members of the Workers Party.

Remorse: A construction division officer apologises to residents after the collapse of the tower block in Pyongyang

North Korean officials offered a rare public apology for the collapse of the apartment building under construction in Pyongyang

Following the collapse, officials linked to the construction offered a humiliating public apology which was then reported - unusually - by North Korea's official news agency.

The building had not been finished, but residents had already started moving in around late November because it is understood only some interior work remained to be completed.

At least 92 households - who as well as Workers Party officials included members of the State Security Department - were believed to be living in the apartment complex when it came down.

South Korean sources told Seoul's Chosun Ilbo newspaper that authorities clearing debris from the site placed a camouflage net over the ruin in order to prevent exposure to satellite photos - but it was too late to stop some pictures emerging.

The state-run Rodong Shinmun daily carried a photo of a high-ranking official bowing to residents near the site of the collapse.

But the photo was carefully shot so as not to include the rubble - instead it showed another apartment building close by.

'Authorities staged the shot by having resident gather in front of a pink building nearby that was standing perfectly tall,' a source, who revealed the true death toll, told the South Korean newspaper

A Unification Ministry official in Seoul said the photo revealed how keen the regime was not to show the actual accident.

Blame was placed on officials who were said to have not shown proper control while the construction was going ahead.

Last month, satellite photos showed that the roof of a luxury villa belonging to leader Kim Jong-Un had collapsed, also due to faulty construction.

An American satellite image expert said the building appeared to be an aquarium that was built in 2011.

Kim Jong-Un had used material imported from Italy and Germany and had then filled it with £2 million worth of marine life including dolphins brought in from China.

North Korean defectors said that military engineers were responsible for building Kim's person villas.

A source told the South Korean newspaper: 'Once Kim Jong-un sets a completion date, there is no arguing.

'This frantic push to meet deadlines is everywhere causing problems with quality.'
