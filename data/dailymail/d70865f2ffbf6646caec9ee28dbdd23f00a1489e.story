Relative connections: The father of Cerberus boss Stephen Feinberg (pictured) lives in Newtown, Connecticut

There is a new connection between the private equity firm Cerberus who owns the gun manufacturer that produced the rifle used by the Sandy Hook shooter.

The father of Cerberus boss Stephen Feinberg lives in Newtown, Connecticut, where a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle made by Remington was used to kill 20 children and six elementary school staff.

The gun used by 20-year-old Adam Lanza in the massacre on Friday is a ‘civilian’ version of the military M-16.

The private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management, announced it was selling Remington Arms Company, one of America’s largest rifle makers, as it tried to distance itself from public and political anger against  the firearms industry.

Pressure mounted on the private 
equity firm to get rid of its holding after the California State 
Teachers' Retirement System threatened to pull the $750million it has 
under Cerberus' management on Monday.

The bold move comes as retail giant Walmart removed the .223-caliber Bushmaster AR-15 from its website in the wake of the devastating massacre and Dick's Sporting Goods also pulled the semi-automatic weapon and others like it from its shelves.

In
 a statement this morning, Cerberus said it was deeply saddened by the 
shootings, adding that they were a 'watershed event' in the national 
debate on gun control.

'We were shocked and deeply saddened by the events that took place at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown... 
We cannot comprehend the losses suffered by the families and friends of 
those killed by the unthinkable crimes committed that day,' the company said.

'It is apparent that the Sandy Hook 
tragedy was a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun
 control to an unprecedented level.

'The debate essentially focuses on the
 balance between public safety and the scope of the Constitutional 
rights under the Second Amendment.'

Cerberus added
 that while it was not its role to attempt to shape or influence the 
debate around firearms, it could take action to ensure it represented 
the interests of its shareholders.

'We believe that this decision allows
 us to meet our obligations to the investors whose interests we are 
entrusted to protect without being drawn into the national debate that 
is more properly pursued by those with the formal charter and public 
responsibility to do so,' the firm said int he statement.

On Friday, 26 people were killed at 
Sandy Hook Elementary School in one of the worst mass shootings in U.S 
history. The shooter, Lanza, used the .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle, along with two other guns, to kill his helpless victims.

Cerberus
has been in the weapons game for at least six years.

The private equity firm, owned by 
billionaire financier Stephen Feinberg, acquired firearms maker 
Bushmaster in 2006.

It later sought to consolidate the fragmented 
weapons industry by snapping up at least six other gun manufacturing 
brands and rolling them into one, which it named Freedom Group.

Cerberus Capital Management acquired Bushmaster Firearms - the maker of Adam Lanza's deadly AR-15 rifle - in 2006.

It then snapped up at least six other gun manufacturing brands and rolled them into one company, which it called Freedom Group, based in Madison, North Carolina.

It is the United States' biggest gun company and is expected to post revenues of about $900 million for 2012 - perhaps boosted by the sobering sales surge over the weekend.

As well as Bushmaster, brands under the Freedom umbrella include Remington Arms, which is the country's largest and oldest rifle maker, and Marlin Firearms, a manufacturer of lever-action rifles.

Freedom also owns Advanced Armament, a maker of pistol silencers.

According to the New York Times, foreign gun manufacturers such as Forjas Taurus of Brazil and Herstal Group of Belgium may be interested in buying up Freedom Group from Cerberus.

As of a 2010 regulatory filing, Cerberus owns more than 95 per cent of Freedom Group.

Freedom Group, based in Madison, North Carolina, reported net sales of
 $677.3 million for the nine months ending September 2012, up from 
$564.6 million in the same period a year ago.

It is heading for total revenues of 
around $900 million for the year, though a shocking sales spike spurred 
on by Friday's shooting could inflate the already-staggering amount 
further.

Other brands coming under the Freedom Group umbrella include Remington Arms, which is the 
country's largest and oldest rifle maker, and Marlin Firearms, a 
manufacturer of lever-action rifles.

Freedom also owns Advanced Armament, a maker of pistol silencers.

As of a 2010 regulatory filing, Cerberus owns more than 95 per cent of Freedom Group.

Cerberus said that it will hire a financial adviser to help with the process of selling its Freedom Group interests.

In its statement, the New York-based company said Freedom Group does not sell weapons or ammunition directly to 
consumers, and that it does not believe that 'Freedom Group or any 
single company or individual can prevent senseless violence or the 
illegal use or procurement of firearms and ammunition.'

Cerberus
 Capital Management makes investments on behalf of clients that include 
the pension plans of firemen, teachers, policemen, and other municipal 
workers and unions, endowments and other institutions and individuals.

It has over $20 billion under management.

The
 California teachers' pension fund, known as CalSTRS, had around $751.4 
million invested with Cerberus at the end of March 2012, according to 
its website.

The hefty investment renders it one of Cerberus' largest clients.

On Monday, CalSTRS announced that following the massacre it was reviewing its relationship with the firm.

'The tragic and devastating acts that took place (on) December 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut have prompted many in this country to call for change: To determine what we can do differently to help ensure the unthinkable never happens again,' the pension fund said in a statement.

'In our case, CalSTRS investment

Also on Monday, the California Treasurer Bill Lockyer raised concerns about the California Public Employees' Retirement System's investments in gun manufacturers and may order the fund's trustees to strip any holdings in gun companies in light of the massacre.

Money made from the Freedom Group stake sale will be returned to its investors, Cerberus said.

According to The New York Times, shares 
of the publicly traded U.S. gunmakers, Sturm, Ruger & Company and 
Smith & Wesson, dropped sharply over the past two days on 
fears of increased gun regulation.

Dick's Sporting Goods,
 one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the world, has removed 
all guns from its store nearest to Newtown, Connecticut, and is 
suspending the sale of certain kinds of semi-automatic rifles from its 
chains nationwide.

Sales of assault weapons have surged across the United States since the Sandy Hook school shooting, as gun enthusiasts brace for a likely tightening of firearm laws.Thousands of Americans headed to their local gun store over the weekend, snapping up the popular AR-15 - one of the three weapons gunman Adam Lanza used to kill 28 people, including himself on Friday.Sales of the .223 ammunition used by the AR-15 also spiked as well as the type of high-capacity magazines affected under the last federal weapons ban, which was introduced in 1994 and allowed to expire.In San Diego, Northwest Armory gun store owner Karl Durkheimer told Fox News that Saturday 'was the biggest day we've seen in 20 years.'Meanwhile, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said it processed more than 4,200 background checks on Saturday, surpassing the previous one-day record of 4,028.

Lanza reportedly tried to buy a gun from
 a Dick's Sporting Goods store in the city of Danbury, about 12 miles 
away from Newtown, prior to the killings.

The company said the reports hadn't 
been confirmed but it was suspending the sale of so-called 'modern 
sporting rifles' out of respect for the victims and families of the 
Sandy Hook school shooting.

'We continue to extend our deepest 
sympathies to those affected by this terrible tragedy,' the sports store
 said in a statement, according to CNN.

A search of Dick's Sporting Goods website on Tuesday morning showed a blank page for 'modern sporting rifles.'

It's not clear how long Dick's will keep the suspension in place for the weapons.

It
 is believed to be the first time the store has taken such a stance 
against guns after a U.S. shooting made worldwide headlines.

'At
 this time, reports that the suspect visited one of our stores last week
 have not been confirmed by law enforcement,' Dick's said.

'Based on our records, we can confirm that no firearms were 
sold to the suspect identified in this case.'

Meanwhile, Walmart has taken the assault-rifle model Lanza used to gun down his victims off its online store.

According to the New York Post, the
 rifle had been available on Walmart's website until Monday afternoon. 
But the listing suddenly disappeared after thenation.com reported that 
scores of the frightening semi-automatic weapon were being sold through 
the retail giant's site.

Thenation.com said the model was available at 1,700 Walmart stores across the country.

It is not clear how Lanza's gun 
enthusiast mother, Nancy, got her hands on the Bushmaster rifle, a 
civilian version of an assault rifle used by troops fighting in the Iraq
 and Afghanistan.
