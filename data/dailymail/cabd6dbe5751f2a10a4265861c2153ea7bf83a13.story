Ellis Island is to open to the public again a year after being struck by Hurricane Sandy.

The 27.5 acre island was left without power for months after the hurricane flooded its boilers and electrical systems, threatening to wash out its rich history of American immigration.

Though much work is still to be done, the island off Manhattan will reopen its doors to visitors on Monday.

Over one million photographs and artifacts are being kept in storage while buildings continue to be restored.

Last year's Hurricane Sandy caused a surge of water to swamp its grounds, leaving it without power for months.

More than 12million people passed 
through the Port of New York between 1892 and 1954 after the US 
government opened the first Federal station for immigration on the 
island in 1890.

It is has been estimated that more than half of the current population can trace their ancestry back to someone who passed through its immigration check points almost 200 years ago.

This is not the first time the island's famous buildings have gone under restoration since its construction in 1890.

With its rich history in immigration the island has become a highly popular tourist destination

On June 15, 1897 a fire destroyed the complex of wooden buildings on the land which had been doubled in size in anticipation of the many foreigners who would come through its ports.

Although more than 150 people were on the island, miraculously no one was killed in the blaze.

The government subsequently made plans to reconstruct the station with fireproof buildings, the first of which was put up in 1900.

In 1902 a hospital was added to the complex, but was overwhelmed with the number of immigrants requiring treatment before they could enter the country.

The nearby Liberty Island was also affected by the hurricane last year but reopened in July. It was forced to close again during the government shut down

Though the station remained open until 1954, the number of foreigners in search of a new life was significantly reduced by the introduction of strict immigration laws in 1920 which put an end to the country's 'open-door policy'.

The nearby Liberty Island was also affected by Hurricane Sandy last summer.

Home to the Statue of Liberty, the small piece of land reopened in July but was forced to close again during the government shutdown.
