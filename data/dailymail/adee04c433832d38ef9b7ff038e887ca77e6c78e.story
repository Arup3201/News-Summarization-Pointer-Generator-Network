Argentina coach Gerardo Martino has backed Sergio Aguero and Angel di Maria to deal with the expectation at their respective Manchester clubs.

The South American nation take on Croatia at Upton Park on Wednesday night, with the Premier League duo key members of a star-studded side.

Mainly talking about Aguero's fortunes, Martino insisted the striker, who has 12 goals so far this season, has what it takes to get Man City out of their rut.

The Argentina boss also says Di Maria is adapting well, and that Man United will improve

'They are players that have a lot of expectations on them, but they are used to it,' Martino told the media, published by the Daily Mirror.

'Maybe the situation changes a little when the team is doing well or not so well. But I am sure Sergio can cope with those expectations, and that he is accustomed to having that pressure on him.'

United are behind City in the table and were in fact beaten last week at the Etihad Stadium, but £60m Di Maria has better players surrounding him, according to the former Barcelona boss.

Martino said that the winger does carry the burden, and backed United to improve as the team get used to each other.

Lionel Messi will also line up for Argentina against Croatia at Upton Park on Wednesday night

'It is hard to compare any team with Real Madrid, the best team in Europe and the most recent champions of Europe.

'Di Maria does carry the burden of being a top player, but the impression I have is that United have other players of high quality, whether it is Robin van Persie or Wayne Rooney.

'He is not isolated, he is playing in a team with other stars - top players. But they need time to get to know each other, and then they will all improve.'
