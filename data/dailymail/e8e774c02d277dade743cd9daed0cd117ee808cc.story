Do you know your child's favorite nursery rhyme, family game or TV character? Do you know what makes them really laugh?  

As research reveals that one in six fathers don't know how to play with their children a leading national nursery is offering parents lessons on how to have fun with their own children. 

Busy Bees day nursery group, who have multiple playgroups across the UK, are offering the coaching for parents to boost their playtime skills when children go home at the end of the day.

The research, conducted by toy company Playmobil, states that most parents of young children worry that they do not spend enough time playing with them, while more than six out of ten parents add that they play with their children only occasionally. 

A third of dads say they simply do not have time to commit to playing.

The course shows parents of babies and toddlers how to play more effectively and a spokesman said: ‘When parents are new, some find playtime easier than others. We encourage them to stay and play and see what their children enjoy doing.

‘Some need ideas of games and activities and others like to find out more about how to interact best with their child. 

‘Parents are always beating themselves up about being a good cook for their children, and worrying whether their child is developing properly, but playtime is a time for both parents and children to enjoy.

‘We have been going for 30 years and so there is a lot of experience for parents to tap into.’

It was also found that more than nine out of ten parents buy electronic toys for their children, but a third of mothers admitted to being baffled by children's high-tech gadgets and games.

Peter Morley, a father of two children who attend Busy Bees nursery in Guiseley, West Yorks, said, ‘I would hope that my children would say I am doing ok. 

‘Busy Bees nurseries hold stay and play sessions and they would be a really good starting point for those parents who need encouragement and ideas.’

Sharon Pearce, an independent play therapist, noted, ‘Parents should play with their children to improve the parent child relationship and increase behaviour and mental health. 

‘Parents are under a lot of pressure to be doing everything at once, but playtime is more important than cleaning the house or the other 100 jobs that need doing.

‘Playing doesn't need to be expensive. It is about fantasy and a cardboard box and bits of paper. 

‘It is like a bank and the more time you spend playing with your children, the better the outcomes will be.’

Margaret Randles, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Busy Bees, said, ‘When a parent chooses Busy Bees as their childcare partner I believe that we have an obligation to provide a range of support and advice.

‘As a parent myself I know every day brings a different challenge, and sometimes you often feel that you are making it up as you go along. 

‘I have always found that having someone to confide in or just to provide reassurance on any issues is helpful. 

‘I consider myself to be very fortunate that when I had my first child I lived above the nursery and had the expertise readily available. 

‘We would always want our parents to know that we are there to support them. That's what a true partnership is.’
