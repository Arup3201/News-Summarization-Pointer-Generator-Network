A woman beaten by a California Highway Patrol officer after walking barefoot along a freeway will receive $1.5million under a settlement reached Wednesday night.

The punches thrown at Marlene Pinnock were filmed by a passing motorist, leading to the settlement as well as the decision by the officer, Daniel Andrew, to resign.

CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow confirmed the settlement in an emailed statement and an attorney for Marlene Pinnock confirmed the dollar amount for The Associated Press.

'When this incident occurred, I promised that I would look into it and vowed a swift resolution,' Farrow's statement said.

'Today, we have worked constructively to reach a settlement agreement that is satisfactory to all parties involved.' 

Andrew joined the CHP in 2012 and has been on paid administrative leave since the incident. Farrow says he 'has elected to resign,' though he could still be charged criminally.

The CHP forwarded the results of its investigation of the incident to Los Angeles County prosecutors last month, saying he could face serious charges but none have been filed yet.

The bulk of the settlement will take the form of a special needs trust for Pinnock, the CHP said.

Pinnock's attorney Caree Harper said the settlement fulfilled the two elements her side was looking for.

'One of the things we wanted to make sure of was that she was provided for in a manner that accommodated her unique situation in life,' Harper said, 'and that the officer was not going to be an officer anymore and we secured those things.'

The July 1 video of Andrew punching Pinnock was captured by a passing driver and spread widely on the internet and television.

According to a search warrant made public in court documents last month, Andrew had just pulled Pinnock from oncoming traffic and she resisted by pushing him.

Multiple drivers called 911 to report her walking barefoot along the side of the freeway.

Andrew then straddled her on the ground as Pinnock resisted by 'kicking her legs, grabbing the officer's uniform and twisting her body,' the warrant said.

Andrew 'struck her in the upper torso and head several times with a closed right fist,' the records say.

The warrant said Pinnock suffered no signs of physical injury and refused medical treatment. She was placed on a psychiatric hold for two weeks.

Pinnock has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had been off her medication for two to three months before the altercation.

In an interview with the AP last month, Pinnock said she believed the officer was trying to kill her.

'He grabbed me, he threw me down, he started beating me,' she said. 'I felt like he was trying to kill me, beat me to death.'
