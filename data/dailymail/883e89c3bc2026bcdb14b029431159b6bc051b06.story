A gang of teenage girls terrorised young women in Manchester's 'studentland' in a string of violent robberies.

Female revellers and university students were targeted in night-time street attacks on Wilmslow Road and its outskirts during the gang's seven-month crime spree, a Manchester Crown Court sentencing hearing was told.

In one incident, five female revellers in Fallowfield were grabbed by their hair and dragged to the ground before being repeatedly punched and kicked by Margaret Grey and Zara Hussain, who binged on vodka before looking for victims.

Daniella Hodge, pictured of Openshaw, Manchester was given a two-year community order after admitting charges of robbery and attempted robbery at Manchester Crown Court following the violent incidents 

The gang targeted their victims in the Fallowfield area of Manchester which was popular with students 

Three hours later, in the same area, another young woman had her earring ripped out and was left covered with blood after the pair pounced on her and stole her phone.

Then two-and-a-half months later, while on bail, Grey teamed up with Daniella Hodge and Chloe Minchion to rob female Manchester University students on their way home in Victoria Park.

The victims were chased down and beaten up before the trio escaped with one of their bags.

Four months after that, again while on bail, Grey and Hussain attacked a shopkeeper who challenged them for touching goods he was moving in Longsight. 

Punched 10 times in the face by Grey, he told police he was 'terrified' of the pair, who subjected him to vile racial slurs.

Grey, 18, of Longsight, Manchester, has been jailed up for 32 months and banned from seeing the other girls by an Asbo after admitting two robberies, two attempted robberies and racially aggravated assault, - offences spanning between last September and April this year.

One of the gang, Chloe Minchion, is wanted by police after failing to turn up to court for her sentencing 

Hussain, 20, of Burnage, Manchester, was jailed for 20 months after admitting robbery and attempted robbery.

Hodge, 18, of  Openshaw, Manchester, was given a two-year community order with supervision and a requirement to attend a probation service programme for robbery and attempted robbery.

Minchion, who recently gave birth to a child, is wanted by police after failing to show up for sentence on the same charges.

Judge Robert Atherton poured scorn on their claims of remorse, saying: 'The victims of all those robberies were young women going about enjoying themselves and minding their own business.

'You fall into that group of people who go out, get drunk, misbehave, and say 'I'm terribly sorry, I was drunk, I've had a bad upbringing, I didn't mean it.'
