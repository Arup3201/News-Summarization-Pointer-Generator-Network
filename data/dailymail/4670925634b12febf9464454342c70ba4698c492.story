It's one of the most iconic bridges in the world - and apparently the most lethal.

Operators of San Francisco's famous Golden Gate Bridge have been busy trying to implement new safety measures to prevent suicides after 2013 was reportedly its deadliest year.

According to The Telegraph, 46 people were known to have jumped to their deaths from the 425-foot high structure last year.

Suicides on the bridge are not officially recorded, so the number could be higher.

If 46 is the figure, however, it means that over 1,500 people have killed themselves at the site since the bridge opened in 1937.

A proposed $66 million project has been put forward to raise the railings and install sweeping nets under the public walkway and cycle path.

There has been disagreement lengthening the railings for decades, principally because it would inhibit the view.

Now that the main focus is on a 20-foot wide, plastic-covered steel net under the walkway, authorities are close to providing funding.

The bridge is the second most popular suicide spot in the world.

Of those who jump, 98 percent do not survive the impact.

The drop takes four seconds and the jumper hits the water at 75 mph.

Only five percent survive that impact, then drown or die of cold in the treacherous waters.

The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in China, which has seen more than 2,000 people kill themselves by jumping since it opened in 1968, is the world's most notorious suicide bridge.

Britain's infamous Beachy Head cliff in East Sussex is the scene of around 20 suicides a year.

Suicides occur occasionally at the Empire State Building in New York - which has fences well above head height on the outdoor observation deck - as well as from other skyscrapers.

The Grand Canyon is often also the scene of suicides.

However the Golden Gate is by far America's top site.

The steel bridge is famous for its distinctive orange-vermillion hue, with the tops of its towers often the only portion visible above San Francisco’s notorious, billowing sea fog.

But from the beginning it has drawn the despondent from near and far.

California Highway Patrol police officers swoop whenever anyone is spotted over the railing.

Kevin Briggs, one of the officers, has talked hundreds of people out of leaping – or grabbed them as they wavered, once spending seven hours persuading a depressed father not to throw himself off.

'But I remember one man who, after I talked to him for 40 to 60 minutes, just said ''Kevin, I have to go now'' and he jumped,' he said.
