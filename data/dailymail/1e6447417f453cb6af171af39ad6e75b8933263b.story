Horrific: Assistant Monmouth County Prosecutor Maria Franceschini swings the frying pan that was used in the murder of Kimberly Allen by her husband Patrick Allen. The couple had two sons

Prosecutors claimed an argument ensued when his wife learned of the situation and Allen killed her while the couple's two children were at school. He was convicted in December.

In her closing statement, Monmouth County Assistant Prosecutor Maria Franceschini picked up the frying pan wrapped in plastic and swung it to show jurors how Allen struck his wife over the head. She then showed jurors autopsy photos showing the result of Kimberly Allen being struck by the frying pan. 

'The past three years has been a living hell for our family. What Pat Allen did is incomprehensible, despicable and heinous. He stole the life of a loving, beautiful mother, daughter, sister and aunt,' said her grieving father

'The loss of Kim is profound and there will always be a hole in our hearts.'

Patrick's son Matthew Allen was in court for the sentencing but did not speak. Their other son, Ryan, was not in the courtroom.

'They will never have their incredible mom to turn to, to watch them play sports, to see them graduate, to talk to or to be there when they become parents themselves,' Wieghorst said in court. 'This is their life story now, their father killed their mother.'
