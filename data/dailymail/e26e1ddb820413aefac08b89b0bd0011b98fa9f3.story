Banned: Phil Morris, a referee appointments secretary at the Manchester FA, has been given a three-month suspension

A referees' boss who made a joke about the Holocaust before a Jewish league match has been suspended by an FA panel.

Phil Morris was banned from all football for three months after he told a referee who was due to oversee the Jewish league game: 'Tell them to remember the concentration camps if they give you any s***.'

The remarks, made in a dressing room at Manchester United's Carrington complex, were overheard by a teenage Jewish official who was left deeply distressed and told his parents.

Morris, a referee appointments secretary at the Manchester FA, was disciplined after a formal complaint was made.

The complaint was passed on to senior officials at the association's London headquarters and a four-men delegation was sent to investigate.

Following a hearing that was held in Manchester on Friday, Morris - from Levenshulme - was found guilty by the FA panel of using ‘abusive and/or insulting words, aggravated by race’.

The charge levelled at the official is the same as breached by Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, who racially abused United defender Patrice Evra and was banned for eight matches.

Morris, who has been on the FA council for 19 years, had denied breaching the rule. He has been suspended from the game until May 1 and has 14 days to appeal the decision.

The remark was made while Morris was running the rule over officials who had overseen a Manchester United youth match at Carrington.

One of the officials is believed to have been in a rush to get changed and leave - leading Morris to ask him why.

When the official said he had to referee a Manchester Jewish Soccer League (MJSL) match, Morris made the offensive remark.

Morris declined to comment when contacted.

Lucille Cohen, president of the Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester and Region, branded the remark ‘absolutely obscene’.

Horrifying history: The concentration camp at Auschwitz

Colin Bridgford, chief executive of the Manchester FA, said: 'Following a hearing conducted by the FA on February 10, Manchester FA can confirm that the FA have suspended Philip Morris from all football and football activity until May 1.

'The commission considered all the evidence in relation to a charge under FA Rule E3(2) in that Mr Morris used abusive and/or insulting words aggravated by race. Mr Morris has the right to appeal in accordance with FA regulations.'

Mr Bridgford added: 'Until that time we will not make further comment other than to state that the Manchester FA throughout have taken the allegations seriously and considered it appropriate for the FA to appoint the panel and hear the case independently.'

Morris, himself a former referee, is involved in disciplinary hearings when amateur players from various Greater Manchester leagues appeal against red-card offences.

He is a well-known figure in refereeing circles and gives talks to up-and-coming officials about implementing the laws of the game.

A spokesman from the Holocaust Education Trust said: 'Such a callous reference to concentration camps is clearly an insult to victims and survivors of the Holocaust as well as any decent minded person – the FA has rightly recognised the deep offence caused by these comments.'
