Elon Musk may be a driving force behind super-intelligent computers, but he's also one of the most outspoken people on its dangers.

He has previously described it as 'summoning the demon' and a threat that is 'more dangerous than nukes.' 

Now the SpaceX-founder says he is donating $10 million (£6.6 million) to the Future of Life Institute for research on how to keep artificial intelligence safe.

Elon Musk says he is donating $10 million (£6.6 million) to the Future of Life Institute for research on how to keep artificial intelligence safe. He has previously said: 'I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that'

In a tweet announcing his investment, the 43-year-old, said it is 'all fun and games' until something goes awry.

Earlier this week, Musk joined Stephen Hawking and other prominent scientists in signing an open letter to ensure AI research benefits humanity.

The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future.

The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind.

The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society.

It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research.

'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write.

But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak.

Earlier this week, a group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking (pictured), have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity

For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work.

In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming.

'Our AI systems must do what we want them to do,' the letter says.

'Many economists and computer scientists agree that there is valuable research to be done on how to maximise the economic benefits of AI while mitigating adverse effects, which could include increased inequality and unemployment.'

Other signatories to the FLI's letter include Luke Muehlhauser, executive director of Machine Intelligence Research Institute and Frank Wilczek, professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Nobel laureate.

The letter comes just weeks after Professor Hawking warned that AI could someday overtake humans.

Google has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence.

The
 search giant has recently bought several robotics companies, along with
 Deep Mind, a British firm creating software that tries to help 
computers think like humans.

One
 of its founders warned artificial intelligence is 'number one risk for 
this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction

'Eventually,
 I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will 
likely play a part in this,' DeepMind's Shane Legg said in a recent 
interview.

Among all forms 
of technology that could wipe out the human species, he singled out 
artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number 1 risk for this century.'

The ethics board, revealed by web site The Information, is to ensure the projects are not abused. Neuroscientist
 Demis Hassabis, 37, founded DeepMind two years ago
 with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans.

Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.'

This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.'

In November, Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind Space-X and Tesla, warned that the risk of 'something seriously dangerous happening' as a result of machines with artificial intelligence, could be in as few as five years. 

Speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AeroAstro Centennial Symposium in October, Musk described artificial intelligence as our 'biggest existential threat'.

He said: 'I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence.

'I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish.

'With artificial intelligence we're summoning the demon. You know those stories where there's the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he's sure he can control the demon? Doesn't work out.'
