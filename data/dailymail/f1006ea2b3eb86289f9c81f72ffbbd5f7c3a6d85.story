A woman dodged two speeding tickets by claiming her husband was driving, even though he had been dead for a year.

Former business owner Catherine Goodwin, 60, got away with the deception until she applied for a passport in her husband’s name and sent with it a photo of a man she met in Spain.

Civil servants became concerned and alerted police who found Goodwin’s husband Alan had died in 2007.

Jailed: Catherine Goodwin was handed a six-month jail term after claiming her dead husband was driving the car on both occasions when she was caught for speeding

But Derby Crown Court was told he had two speeding fines recorded against him in 2008 and six penalty points had been put on his driving licence. 

Details of the speeding incidents were sent to her home in Ilkeston, Derbyshire and she replied saying her husband was the driver and paid the £60 fines.

Alex Wolfson, prosecuting, said: 'The DVLA didn’t realise he had passed away until these matters were drawn to their attention.

'Somewhat bizarrely and for no apparent reason, this defendant later made an application for a British passport in the name of her late husband, who passed away in 2007.'

The first application was made in 2011 but was returned to her.

She then made a second one, again in the name of her late husband, and included the photograph of a man who has never been identified.

She admitted two counts of perverting the course of justice and two of making fraudulent applications to get a passport.

Steve Gosnell, in mitigation, said she had no penalty points on her licence and so did not risk a ban because of the speeding tickets.

He said: 'There would be an increase in insurance but this is clearly not the situation where somebody has nine points and gets a partner, grandfather or uncle to take the points so they avoid disqualification.'

She was 'primary carer' for her husband, who had cancer. When he died, she suffered from depression and discovered he was in debt. That resulted in 'loan sharks' chasing her, Mr Gosnell said.

Judge Ebrahim Mooncey told Goodwin her actions were 'callous', 'attacking the very fabric of the justice system'

'There were debts with legitimate companies and loan sharks were also coming out of the woodwork. Her husband had passed away and she had no one to turn to,' he added. 

'She was not thinking clearly, not thinking as she would normally. She was not aware of the seriousness of what she has done.'

The court heard Goodwin used to own a printing business and was a trained bookkeeper. After being widowed, she lived in Spain and was ordered by debt collectors to produce her husband’s passport.

She used a photograph of a man she met in Spain. Mr Gosnell said: 'She signed it to say it was a likeness of her husband. There is no sophistication. She gave her phone number and e-mail.'

Passing sentence Judge Ebrahim Mooncey told Goodwin: 'It sounds quite callous what you did. Perverting justice is attacking the very fabric of the justice system.'
