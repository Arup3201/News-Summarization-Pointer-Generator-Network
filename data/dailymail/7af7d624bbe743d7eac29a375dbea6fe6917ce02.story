Playwright Alan Bennett, who has said that England is a nation of hypocrites and that English are 'better than all the rest' at setting double standards

We are a nation famed the world over for conquest, industry – and of course a good cup of tea.

But according to playwright Alan Bennett, what England really excels at is ‘hypocrisy.’

The writer made the astonishing attack as part of a milestone series celebrating the 50th anniversary of BBC Radio 4’s World at One.

In each edition, the participants are asked to nominate what they believe to be one of Britain’s world-class achievements. 

Mr Bennett, 80, said he toyed with the idea of suggesting the National Trust, medieval churches or the impressive landscape of Swaledale.

But in an interview with Martha Kearney, to be broadcast today, he says he believes that what the English are ‘better than all the rest’ at is setting double standards.

He said: ‘In England, what we do best is lip service. Take London; we extol its beauty and its dignity while at the same time we’re happy to sell it off to the highest bidder. Or highest builder. We glory in Shakespeare yet we close our public libraries.

‘A substantial minority of our children receive a better education than the rest because of the social situation of the parents.

‘Then we wonder why things at the top do not change or society improve. But we know why. It’s because we are hypocrites.’ 

He went on to claim that too often, the English are lazy in their assumptions that problems which affect other countries do not exist in their own, saying: ‘Our policemen are wonderful, provided you’re white and middle class and don’t take to the streets.

‘And dying in custody is what happens in South America. It doesn’t happen here.’

He added: ‘A memorable phrase in Hamlet, and one of the few that hasn’t been picked up as a quotation or a title for something else, is when Claudius is arranging for Hamlet to be arrested and executed when he gets to our shores. 

As part of his explanation, the writer says that policeman in England are wonderful, 'provided you're white and middle class and don't take to the streets' (file picture) 

And in his letter he says; “Do it England”. And we say we do it, or we’re going to do it, but we don’t. Scotland does it. And Wales. But not England.’

He was careful not to exempt himself from his own criticism, saying: ‘Before you stampede for the Basildon Bond, or rather skitter for the Twitter, I must say that I don’t exempt myself from these strictures. How should I? I am English, I am a hypocrite.’

In January the World at One heard nominations from the Prime Minister David Cameron and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband and other party leaders.

World at One was first broadcast on 4 October 1965 on the Home Service and was presented by William Hardcastle.
