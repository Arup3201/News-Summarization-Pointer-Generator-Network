It's either the most detailed paint job ever or New Yorkers are the most inattentive people in the world.

You decide.

A video of a model parading around the streets of Manhattan's Midtown neighborhood completely naked - but her legs covered in paint that had been fashioned to look like jeans, complete with stitching and even on-trend patches - quickly went viral this week.

The funny footage was part of a social experiment by Model Pranksters to determine just how observant the people of New York City are.

The result? Not very. 

Getting ready: Model Leah Jung is painted by a team of experts from The Body of Art in preparation for a social experiment about New York

Realistic: Naked from the waist down, the model was given paint-on jeans that looked exceptionally real

Don't give a damn: As the model ventured out on the streets of New York, she was filmed from behind to gauge the reaction of the people who passed her

Just another passenger: Even on a packed subway, no one noticed the model was not wearing pants

Bustling: Even in Times Square, no one gave a second look

Mecca: Walking up and down the famous Times Square steps also failed to turn heads

Lunch rush: Customers at McDonald's were much more interested in burgers than Jung's behind

The model, Leah Jung, was expertly painted by body art company The Body of Art, according to Elite Daily.

The video, which garnered close to one million views in one day, shows her venturing on the subway, down the steps of Times Squares and even into McDonald's for lunch.

All the while, nobody seems to notice she is essentially naked.

The best of the footage shows Jung strolling into popular women's fashion chain Forever 21 and asking a staff member where she can buy the same 'jeans'.

The employee looks at her and the 'pants' and tells her to 'check downstairs' of the store.

However Jung did not go completely unnoticed.

While filling up her Metrocard, a man comes up behind her and takes a photo of her, well, behind.

She turns just in time to catch him and laughs raucously.  

Topping up: Jung topped up her Metrocard ticket beside a family, who were none the wiser

Gotcha: One observant man - perhaps the only one - caught the model out, taking a picture of her derriere to prove it

A very similar experiment took place earlier this year in a much more assuming part of the world - North France.

A model walked around the city of Lille with painted-on blue jeans, only this model was wearing a g-string. 

The French model allowed her her pal, make-up artist Marie 'Marie P' Przybylski to paint on a pair of trustyeveryday denim and then she went outside for a stroll.

Paired with a bra and shirt tied at the waist, the model, also named Marie, walked the streets as usual.

Only her trip managed to cause quite a stir. 

That's one way to get attention! A French model walks down the streets of Lille with jeans painted on

The idea was thought up by students Sarah Baboro and David Lesage, who study PR at a school in Belgium.

Their homework assignment was to create a 'Buzz video' for their final exam - that is, one that would generate a lot of views and publicity.

And it seems they certainly fulfilled their brief.

The pair recruited the make-up artist, who took two hours creating the faded blue jeans on Marie's legs using body paint.

And she's off! The model walks out onto the street with her painted jeans and a shirt on and onto the streets of Lille in France
