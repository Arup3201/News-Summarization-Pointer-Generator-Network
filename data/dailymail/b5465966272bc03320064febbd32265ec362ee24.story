Chelsea are confident Diego Costa will not be a long-term casualty after the striker suffered a hamstring injury last week.

The striker, who has scored four goals in Chelsea's three Barclays Premier League games so far, withdrew from Spain's squad to face Macedonia with a hamstring injury on Friday.

Costa is back in London and the Blues' medical team have conducted their own tests on the £32million man.

Confident: Chelsea are hopeful Diego Costa (left) could return to action against Swansea on Saturday 

And Chelsea chiefs are hopeful Costa will not be a long-term injury concern for Jose Mourinho.

The Blues boss will make a late decision on whether to consider the former Atletico Madrid man for the clash against Swansea on Saturday, though it is understood Mourinho is not ruling him out yet.

Costa's hamstring will continue to be monitored ahead of the clash against Garry Monk's side on Saturday.

Mourinho may decide to save his star striker for Chelsea's first Champions League clash of the season against Schalke on Wednesday.

Jumping for joy: The Spaniard has scored three goals in two Premier League appearances this term
