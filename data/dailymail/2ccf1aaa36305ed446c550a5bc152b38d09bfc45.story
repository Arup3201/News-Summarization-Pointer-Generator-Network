Most women can relate to the irritation of wearing a heavy, uncomfortable bra for a long day.

We look forward to removing our brassieres when we get home with the same enthusiasm as ditching a pair of high heels.

Now M&S have released a super lightweight bra designed to remove the discomfort associated with good support.

The new Light as Air bra may look no different to other fashion bras but it weighs much less and is designed to be super comfy and breathable

The Light as Air™ bra is a new concept which provides shape and fit but is also incredibly light and designed to feel like wearing nothing at all.

Weighing 39 grams, this bra is 11 grams lighter than the average bra and is the lightest bra sold by M&S.

But unlike many super comfortable items of lingerie the sleek looking bra won’t let you down with support or in the fashion stakes.

The chic minimalist design means you won’t be embarrassed to strip down into your underwear should the mood strike you.

The bra is also designed to mold to the wearer, providing ample support for that morning run to catch a bus but without the bulk of heavy padding.

The cups are padding free, yet maintain a smooth shape and a mesh lining along the wire channel provides extra breathability and comfort.

Paschal Little, Head of Lingerie Innovation at M&S says 'The ultra light weight and breathable materials used in our brand new Light as Air TM bra are developed to keep you cool and comfortable in the warmer months.

The Light as Air bra also comes in nude and black, available in sizes 32A to 40DD and costs £19.50

‘We have incorporated an airy, open work channel below the cup to increase the feeling of coolness, comfort and airflow through the garment. This modern concept bra is neither padded nor non padded, but is moulded to give you a feminine shape with definition'

Not only is this bra the perfect cool summer solution but it’s also the perfect bra to wear under some of this season’s hottest trends.

Soozie Jenkinson, Head of Lingerie Design at M&S says 'In line with the emerging Summer trends towards more elegant dressing and sheerer layers we launch our new Light as Air TM bra.

'Designed to complement your new look summer wardrobe, this new bra sets the pace for a fresh approach to new summer underpinnings.'
