An autopsy conducted on 11-year-old Celina Cass was unable to determine how she died, authorities said yesterday.

Divers found Celina Cass's body Monday 
morning near a hydroelectric dam that spans the Connecticut River 
between her home town of Stewartstown, New Hampshire, and Canaan, 
Vermont.

Celina's death has been deemed suspicious, based on what divers found, and investigators were treating the case as a criminal investigation.

Celina, who lived with her older sister, mother and stepfather a mile from Canada, was last seen at her home computer around 9 pm on July 25 and was gone the next morning.

Police said there was no sign of a struggle and there was no indication she ran away or someone took her.

Community residents were saddened that the autopsy wasn't able to provide them with any closure.

'I don't even know what to say.

'I thought the community needed some answers, and I thought we were going to get them tonight,' said Debbie Whelan, whose daughter, a friend of Celina's, was sobbing after watching a news report on a TV monitor.

The lack of answers was 'scary,' said Shannon Towle, who owns a convenience store across the street from the house where Celina lived with her mother, sister, stepfather and a man named Kevin Mullaney, said by neighbors to be the son of a former boyfriend of her mother, Louisa Noyes.

'We still don't know what happened, and that's terrifying,' Towle said.

After the news conference, teenagers gathered in a town park, where candles were lit in Celina's memory.

'Someone has to light the way for Celina,' said Kayla Baglio, 18.

'It's to let her know no matter what, people are going to be here for her.'

Earlier Tuesday, investigators combed the area along the river, which divides Vermont and New Hampshire, above where Celina's body was found.

A crime scene technician said they were doing computer-aided diagramming to give them a precise electronic image of the area.

At the peak of the search for Celina, more than 100 federal, state 
and local law enforcement officers descended upon the town of 800 
residents, searching a mile-wide area around her home, including woods 
and ponds.

Because
of the town's remote location, law enforcement officers went so far as 
to have a cellphone tower erected to assist in communications.

On Monday, the intense search came to an abrupt end when New Hampshire Fish and Game Department divers found her body near a hydroelectric dam that spans the Connecticut River between Stewartstown and Canaan.

Investigators on Tuesday combed the area along the river, which divides Vermont and New Hampshire, above where Celina's body was found. A crime scene technician said they were doing computer-aided diagramming to give them a precise electronic image of the area.

Celina's stepfather, Wendell Noyes, who reportedly was hospitalized hours before her body was recovered from the river, returned to the community Tuesday.

Witnesses said Noyes was taken away by ambulance Monday after lying down with his face in his arms outside a home where he had been staying in Stewartstown.

Hospital officials declined to say whether he was a patient.

Shannon Towle, owner of Towle's Mini-Mart, said she sold him cigarettes Tuesday morning.

In the first days after Celina disappeared, Noyes had described her as a quiet girl who would not have left home on her own, but he had declined to comment further.

Stewartstown Days said.

He added: 'They need something 
that's on a little happier note for them.'

Residents
described Celina as a sweet, friendly child. One of Celina's best 
friends, 11-year-old Makayla Riendeau, said Celina loves her mother and 
likes her stepfather and wouldn't run away.

said Celina is very athletic, is a stickler about getting her school 
work done on time and loves having friends over to her house.
