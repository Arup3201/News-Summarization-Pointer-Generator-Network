It was probably not the best moment for Nigel Farage to discuss Ukip’s problem attracting the female vote.

Posing on a tank after downing three pints of beer yesterday, he admitted his party’s ‘blokeish’ image may put women off.

Digging himself deeper into a hole, he asked: ‘What do you want me to do? Go sell flowers?’

He hopes Ukip candidate John Bickley can defy the odds and overturn a Labour majority of almost 6,000

Mr Farage also inspected the inside of an armoured personnel carrier during his visit to the museum 

The Ukip leader was campaigning in Heywood and Middleton ahead of tomorrow’s by-election. His party’s candidate in the Labour stronghold near Manchester is attracting only half as many votes from women as from men.

A poll showed that if only men were voting, Ukip would win the by-election, triggered by the death of Labour MP Jim Dobbin.

Some 41 per cent of men said they would vote Ukip, compared with 38 per cent for Labour. In contrast, only 21 per cent of women said they would vote Ukip, compared with 58 per cent for Labour. Labour is predicted to retain the seat it won in 2010 with a 6,000 majority.

But Ukip is expected to come a close second and Mr Farage posed on the Chieftain Mk10 owned by one of his supporters to demonstrate his claim that the party has its tanks on Labour’s lawn.

Ukip has faced claims of sexism, particularly after one of its MEPs said last year that a group of female activists were ‘sluts’.

Mr Farage had at first denied yesterday that his party had ‘a women problem’. But he added: ‘I am not going to pretend to reach out to female voters or voters of all different denominations. 

During his campaigning, Mr Farage made his now traditional visit to a local pub, The Gardeners Arms

Ukip have stepped up their attacks on Labour in an attempt to prove they are not just able to take votes from the Tories

‘The problem with female voters and Ukip is that, over the last five to ten years, at times, on a very bad day, we’ve looked a bit blokeish, a bit like a rugby club on a day out and I’m probably the most guilty person of all.’

He insisted there had been a ‘sea change’ in 2014 which had seen a boom in women candidates and senior party figures.

Ukip is expected to win tomorrow’s other by-election, in Clacton, sparked by the defection of Tory MP Douglas Carswell.

Embarrassingly for the Conservatives, London mayor Boris Johnson yesterday forgot the name of his party’s candidate in the Essex seat, former Bread actor Giles Watling.

Last night it emerged that Mr Farage has been elected unopposed as Ukip leader for another four years.

But that means that if he does not win a seat in next May’s general election and Mr Carswell holds Clacton, it would lead to an uncomfortable situation where the party’s leader is outside the Commons even though it has an MP inside.
