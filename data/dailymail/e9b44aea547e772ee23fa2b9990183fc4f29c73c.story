Bombs lighting up the sky at 3am, the ear-shattering noise of endless blasts and her home shaking constantly under the impact of rockets are just some of the heartbreaking experiences a 16-year-old Gazan teen is documenting on Twitter.

Farah Baker lives opposite Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital.

She can not eat breakfast without a bomb disturbing her meal, burning cars lay outside her front door and her neurosurgeon father has shown her 'a fragment from the brain of a 9-year-old child'. 

Every day she fears she might die.

On Monday a rocket landed in a park next to the hospital, reportedly killing 10 Palestinians, nine of them innocent children.

'This is in my area. I can't stop crying. I might die tonight #Gaza #GazaUnderAttack #ICC4Israel #AJAGAZA,' she wrote.

The three-week conflict has so far claimed the lives of 1,060 Gazans, most of them civilians. Israel has lost 48 soldiers and another three civilians have been killed by Palestinian rocket fire, according to official figures.

'They are bombing heavily in my area. This is the worst night in this war. I just want you to know that I might martyr at any moment #Gaza,'she said.

This is just one of the thousands of terrifying incidents Farah and her 6-year-old sister have endured throughout their short lives.

Their home has been in the middle of a war zone three times already. Their bedroom windows are constantly shattered by attacks.

For three-weeks, Farah has told how she is trapped inside her house in the middle of one of the fiercest strikes on Gaza.

She is often without power and unable to do simple things such as walk outside or visit a school friend.

'We are sitting in darkness bc th power is off, flares r lightening up th area just like it's midday,we're just hearin bombs,drones,f16s#Gaza,' she wrote on Monday.

'Not only my area is suffering of this night, all parts of #Gaza strip are hearing bombs and seeing flares, this is y we've no shelters,' she added.

Farah has over 20,000 followers on Twitter and is documenting the horrific sites of war she is seeing from home

Farah once witnessed a window fall on  her little sister. 'She's shaking and unable to breathe,' she wrote

During a brief ceasefire from shelling on 25 July, Farah posted her joy of being able to walk outside her house with less of a risk of being killed.

'July 25 There's a ceasefire today for 12hrs. I'll get 2 th street and keep walking walking walking till I get exhausted & miss home #Gaza #AJAGAZA.'

'There's a ceasefire today for 12hrs. I'll get 2 th street and keep walking walking walking till I get exhausted & miss home #Gaza #AJAGAZA,' she wrote.

Farah described how her sister covers her ears to try and hide the sound of the bombs

She is desperate for the rockets to stop falling. 'I am crying,' she wrote in one heartbreaking tweet

Farah can not escape the blasts and says she might 'martyr at any moment'

'I AM GOING TO HANG OUTTTT! I can't believe this!!!!!!! I'm going to meet my best friend #Gaza,' she said.

As the blasts go on she also continues to post Vine videos to her over 20,000 followers from her bedroom window showing devastation such as the 'Smoke of a bomb seen from my home now.'

Another video is captioned: 'Okay. The 8163662 bomb I could hear today! This is UNBELIEVABLE!! #Gaza 2:13am'
