A male teacher and an 18-year-old pupil who 'formed a relationship' have been pictured for the first time after a police investigation prompted him to step down. 

Daniel McQuoid, 24, resigned from his position at Emmanuel College in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, after becoming 'romantically-involved' with Jayne Louise Emmett.

Parents at the top Christian school, which educates around 1,200 pupils aged between 11 and 19, received a letter from principal Jonathan Winch informing them that the member of staff had left.

Probe: Police have begun an investigation into the pair's relationship at the top Christian school

The student, aged 18, recently left the college after completing her A levels.

A spokesman for the school, which was ranked 'Outstanding' in all five Ofsted inspections to date, said the 'friendship' was conducted with approval of the student's parents but it breached the college's staff professional code of conduct.

'A male teacher has resigned from the college after forming a friendship with a female student,' she said.

'The student, aged 18, recently left college having completed her A levels.

'The friendship was conducted with the knowledge and approval of the student's parents but breached the college's Staff Professional Code of Conduct.'

Founder: Emmanuel College was set up by businessman and philanthropist Sir Peter Vardy in 1988 as one of the country's first city technology colleges

Police confirmed that an investigation into the allegations was underway.

'Inquiries are being carried out after police were informed about concerns about a relationship between a teacher and a student,' said a Northumbria Police spokesman.

Earlier this year the school was recognised as one of the best in the country when it comes to students' progression.

Emmanuel College was described as 'leading the field' in improving outcomes for students and congratulated for its 'exceptional achievement'.

Success levels at GCSE show the college is among the top 20 per cent of schools in England for the value it adds to enable students to progress and for students' high attainment.

Its overall pass rate for the benchmark five GCSEs at grade C or better was 99.5 per cent and 91 per cent including English and mathematics.

Emmanuel College was founded by businessman and philanthropist Sir Peter Vardy in 1988 as one of the country's first city technology colleges under the then Thatcher Government.

The school, which takes children from across Gateshead and the West End of Newcastle, has had consistently high exam results.

However, it has often courted controversy because of accusations - always denied by Sir Peter - that his strong Christian beliefs led to the teaching of creationism in the school.

His foundation also set up city academies in Middlesbrough and Doncaster, and the all-age Bede Academy in Blyth, taking both primary and secondary school children.

But some local authorities in the North East were resistant to setting up academies with Sir Peter, whose father founded the Reg Vardy car dealership, because of the Christian ethos he insisted on at his schools.
