Boasting a private tasting room, a cinema and an on-call personal trainer, this lavish London penthouse is more like a top hotel than a home - and it comes with a price tag to match.

The lavish Marylebone apartment has gone on sale for £25 million and comes complete with a local in the shape of top celebrity hangout, the Chiltern Firehouse which sits next door.

Part of a new development called The Chilterns, the four-bedroom property also has David Bailey artworks, a sauna and an in-house chef.

This slice of uber luxury is the most expensive ever to come on sale in London's Marylebone 

The £25 million property, which is being sold off-plan has a roof terrace, which at 2,519 sqft is the largest private terrace in the West End

Other perks include an on-site gym and a 24-hour hotel-style concierge which will take care of everything from travel arrangements and theatre tickets to dry cleaning and shopping.

However, the property, which covers two floors and has a 2,519 square foot roof terrace, isn't yet complete and has to be bought off-plan.

For those who can't afford the lavish price tag, the neighbouring penthouse - which offers similar perks - is currently on sale for a relatively modest £12.6m.

Despite the hefty fee, top independent property expert, David Williams, says the apartment is likely to be purchased by a foreign buyer.

The penthouses have been designed by top architect firm Squire & Partners and interior designer Rabih Hage

The lobby will contain photographs taken by David Bailey of nearby Regent’s Park

'It's Chinese and Russians who have been fuelling London's top prime property market for the last few years,' he explains.

Mr Williams also says the artworks are unlikely to impress potential buyers. 'I don’t think David Bailey’s favourite picture hanging on the wall is going to make a big difference to how much this will sell for,' he says.

'In my experience, if you've got £25million to spend, it's not by accident - you've done something smart to accrue it. 

'So buyers will be looking at the capital growth of the property - but of course they'll want something fully serviced and well appointed.'

The master bedroom suite, which is the same size as an average one-bed flat, has a bedroom with a living area opening onto two private terraces

The walk-in dressing room is lined with bespoke built in cupboards

Is it his or hers? The master suite has two ensuite bathrooms, both decked in marble  

The penthouses have been designed by top architects Squire & Partners, while the chic interiors are the work of designer, Rabih Hage.

Inside the £25m four-bedroom duplex, which has 5,047 square foot of internal living space, is a grand reception room  that spans the building and has a raised  ceiling and windows.

Folding glass walls open onto three private rooftop terraces - the first, a vast outside reception room and garden, the second, an outside dining room and the third, a sun deck for loungers.

On the other floor is a large family kitchen and breakfast room, a sitting room with feature fireplace and a 16-seater formal dining room opening onto another private terrace.

The 775 sqft private cinema can seat up to 10 people with an interior designed in the style of the luxurious Electric Cinema in Notting Hill

The development has a gym (gym reception pictured above), sauna, 24-hour hotel-style concierge (to take care of travel arrangements and theatre tickets to dry cleaning and shopping) and valet parking

The master bedroom, which at 200 square foot is the same size as the average one-bedroom flat, has a separate living area opening onto two private terraces, a walk-in dressing room lined with bespoke built-in cupboards and his and hers ensuite bathrooms.

As well as three further bedroom suites, the duplex also features a studio flat with bedroom, kitchenette, living area and bathroom, which the agent suggests is suitable for staff - or teenagers.

The two floors of the duplex are linked by a private glass lift  but there's also a staircase for those happy to make the hike.

In all, there are 44 residences behind the contemporary seven-storey glass and stone façade. From the outside, the building also has a striking stepped roofline  and glass-fronted balconies.

There may be a chef on site but that doesn't mean you'll have to do without a kitchen

The apartments overlook the greenery of Paddington Street Gardens, and front onto Chiltern Street, home to celebrity hotspot, The Chiltern Firehouse

The 775 sqft private cinema can seat up to 10 people with an interior in the style of the luxurious Electric Cinema in Notting Hill.

Developers are currently in discussions with a number of leading cinema operators with a view to them providing the latest films and documentaries for the cinema, in addition to Netflicks, Sky, BBC and ITV and other channels.

The lobby will contain photographs taken by David Bailey of nearby Regent’s Park and has also created a book featuring 44 specially commissioned prints of the local area. 

Each owner of an apartment at The Chilterns will be given a framed original David Bailey print from this series, together with a copy of the book.
