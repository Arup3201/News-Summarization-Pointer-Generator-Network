The funeral of married mother-of-three Ellen Brody, the driver of an SUV which was hit by a train on Tuesday in Valhalla, New York, took place on Friday. She and five others died in the horrific collision

The SUV driver involved in a train wreck that claimed six lives was 'a beautiful soul' who always took a genuine interest in others, her rabbi said on Friday outside her funeral.

Many young adults were among the mourners at the Dobbs Ferry, New York funeral for Ellen Brody, a 49-year-old mother of three daughters in their teens and 20s.

'I was looking through our archives last night. We have dozens of pictures of Ellen,' Rabbi Benjy Silverman said before the service.

'And in each one, without fail, she has a huge smile, a warm smile. We call it the Ellen Smile.'  

She was 'a beautiful soul' who also found beauty in others, Silverman said. 'She adored her daughters and husband. She was their biggest fan and supporter.'

Brody's husband, daughters and brother spoke at the 'sad and moving' service, said Greenburgh Town Supervisor Paul Feiner, a family friend.

The service was 'a celebration of her life. ... Everyone said she was upbeat. 

'There was a universal description of her life as a very warm, caring, compassionate, kind, giving person'. 

Family and friends had gathered to remember Mrs Brody at 10am at the Chabad of the Rivertowns.

A large floral tribute was also seen being carried into the synagogue. 

Mrs Brody was killed along with five passengers on Tuesday night when the train crashed into her SUV on the tracks at a railroad crossing in the Westchester County town of Valhalla.

Her family said on Thursday that they were devastated.

'She was a warm, vivacious and dynamic presence in our lives, and the most loving and nurturing mother, wife, daughter and sister,' a statement read.  

The private funeral of Eric Vandercar, another victim of the train crash, was taking place on Friday afternoon in Mount Kisco, New York. 

His devastated wife and young children thanked those who had shown them support following the tragic loss of the 53-year-old. 

Passengers on the train which plowed into the SUV - in the worst tragedy on the network in more than 30 years -  returned to the busy commuter service feeling 'lucky and scared' on Thursday.

According to investigators' preliminary findings, Mrs Brody's car was in the danger zone inside railroad crossing gates for about half a minute before the train hit. 

Mrs Brody got ahead of the crossing gate in inching traffic, then got out of her car to examine it after the gate came down and hit the back of it, a witness has said. 

But then she got back in, seeming unhurried, and advanced onto the track, the witness told news outlets and investigators.

The train's engineer also told investigators that he saw the Mercedes SUV moving onto the tracks.

Mrs Brody's friends rushed to her rushed to her defense saying that she was a careful driver who would not have taken any risks.

Data recorders also show the Metro-North Railroad train's engineer hit the emergency brakes and sounded the horn as the train bore down on the Valhalla crossing, traveling 58 mph in a 60 mph zone, National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Robert Sumwalt said Thursday.

Flashing warning lights at the crossing illuminated 39 seconds before the crash, and the gates came down a few seconds later, Mr Sumwalt said. That would leave about 30 seconds that the SUV was inside the gates.

Investigators haven't found any problems with the warning signals or the nearby traffic lights, which are synchronised to let drivers clear the crossing when a train is coming, Mr Sumwalt said. The crossing also had painted warnings on its pavement, and a sign 65 feet from the rail warns drivers not to stop on the tracks, he noted.

The agency hasn't mapped out how far before the crossing the engineer hit the emergency brakes on the train, which takes about 950 feet and 30 seconds to stop, Sumwalt said.

After the impact, flames enveloped the SUV and part of the train, and the electrified third rail pierced them. Hundreds of passengers scrambled through spreading smoke and fear, some helping each other to escape despite their own injuries. 

Trains hit cars on the tracks many times a year, but such crashes rarely kill train riders. Investigators have emphasized that they want to figure out why this one did, becoming the deadliest accident in the 32-year history of one of the nation's busiest commuter railroads.

Investigators are looking for any elements that may have intensified the fire, which they believe was ignited by the SUV's gas tank. 

The NTSB has been examining such factors as the adequacy of emergency exits, the  train cars and the unusual design of the Metro-North line's third rail.

The agency also is looking into how familiar Brody was with her car and her route, whether she was using a cellphone and whether the backed-up traffic played a role.
