A waiter who mistakenly threw away up to $7,000 in a 'Tips For Jesus' gratuity is praying that the money can be resurrected.

Ron Kinney, 67, waits tables at the French Quarter Restaurant in West Hollywood, California. In December, he received a huge tip on a $50 bill - but threw away the receipt, thinking that a diner had simply had too much to drink.

Unbeknown to Mr Kinney, 'Tips for Jesus' is a phenomenon sweeping the country where restaurant staff from New York to Arizona have been left thousands of dollars by an extremely generous, anonymous patron.

It's a miracle! Restaurant staff up and down the country have been receiving big tips on checks stamped with @tipsforjesus

It has been claimed that at least one of the 'Tips For Jesus' do-gooders is former PayPal vice president Jack Selby.

By the time Mr Kinney and his co-workers realized the good fortune, the receipt was gone.

Mr Kinney told the San Francisco Chronicle: 'I was pretty naive.

'I thought it was someone who had a drink too many and didn’t realize what they were doing.

He added: “The money would sure have come in handy for me to help for retirement. We have no such plan at work.'

In December, Aruj Dhuwan, a waiter at 
Bo's Kitchen, New York, said he was left a staggering tip of $1,000 
dollars from a table he served late on Saturday night that included Mr 
Selby.

It was the third time
 the Tips For Jesus lightning struck in the city in a single weekend.

A 
worker at The Smith near Lincoln Center was left $3,500, while another 
at NoMad in the Flatiron District got $7,000.

It
 has previously been speculated that Mr Selby, who became a 
multimillionaire when PayPal was sold to eBay, was the person behind 
Tips For Jesus.

The 
39-year-old businessman is believed to have handed out tens of thousands
 of dollars in tips in the past three months at cafes and clubs from 
Michigan to California.

Mr Selby was among a small group of alumni who made a fortune at PayPal, and since leaving the firm has dabbled in film production, venture capitalism and now, according to his Facebook, he's opened a dry-cleaning business.

While he hasn't officially revealed himself anywhere since the story went viral, he posted a link to an article about one generous gratuity on his page. And his Facebook friends appear to be in on the charitable scheme.

One, Anne Woolway, commented: 'Do we win if we know whom is behind tipsforjesus?'

Another, Rob Hughes, added: 'and the mystery tipper strikes again...'

Mr Kinney, 67, who waits tables at the French Quarter restaurant in West Hollywood, said that he had no idea that the huge tip was serious and it would have been useful for his retirement

Mr Selby also owns homes in all the states where tips were received, including multiple residences in Arizona and California. 

Last year, Mr Selby started a company Incognito Pictures with the aim to make movies for a budget of $10 million or less.

He secured $50million in financing for the project and entered into a long-term distribution deal with The Weinstein Company.

Tipsforjesus has left a trail of extremely happy servers across the country after dropping the ridiculously generous tips.
