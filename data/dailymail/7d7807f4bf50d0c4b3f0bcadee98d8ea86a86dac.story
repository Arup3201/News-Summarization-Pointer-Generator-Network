A thug who was convicted today for an attack which left a groom-to-be in a permanent coma will be out of jail in just eight months.

Rory Rogers, 24, had his future shattered by a single 'haymaker' punch thrown by James Toulouse after a pub row in Saundersfoot, Pembrokeshire.

Toulouse, also 24, was jailed for two-and-half years today at Swansea Crown Court after confessing to grievous bodily harm.

Rory Rogers, 24, with his fiancée Stacey Mckeowen, 26: Mr Rogers has been in a persistent vegetative state since November when he was floored by a wild punch after a pub row in Saundersfoot, Pembrokeshire

But Mr Rogers' family and his fiancée, Stacey McKeown, 26, fear he faces spending the rest of his life in a persistent vegetative state.

Since the attack on November 16 last year he has never regained consciousness and Miss McKeown keeps a daily vigil at his bedside.

She was in court yesterday to see Toulouse jailed. But she left in tears after hearing that, taking into account time served on remand, he could be out in just eight months.

Guilty: James Toulouse was jailed for two-and-half years at Swansea Crown Court after confessing to grievous bodily harm, but he could be out in months

Swansea Crown Court heard both men were drinking in the Deck bar in the seaside resort of Saundersfoot, Pembrokeshire, and had 'a heated exchange of words'.

Mr Rogers left, but Toulouse chased after him, knocked him down with a wild swing to the head and continued to rain down blows on his victim on the ground.

Judge Paul Thomas told Toulouse: 'Your haymaker punch caused the damage and left Rory in a persistent vegetative state and he has never regained consciousness.

'As Rory lay on the ground you followed up with kicks and punches.

'You were looking for trouble and liked to portray yourself as the local hard man.

'You simply believed that you had won the fight by knocking him out and you later celebrated and boasted about what you had done.'

A haymaker punch is a wild swing whipped sideways from the shoulder, with minimal elbow bend. They are favoured by unskilled fighters who want to cause the most damage with their blows.

Jim Davis, prosecuting, said Toulouse 'had intended to inflict serious injury' and that he 'appeared pleased and proud at what he had done.'

Toulouse, of Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire, showed no reaction as he was jailed for two and a half years after admitting grievous bodily harm.

Accomplice: Jason McReynolds was given a 12 month supervision order and told to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work for attempting to pervert the course of justice after he tried to help Toulouse escape

Judge Thomas said: 'A petty drunken row ended with a young man’s life devastated.

'Rory Rogers had a bright future ahead of him but now all is lost to him.

'His family and girlfriend have been left with their lives shattered too.'

Toulouse has been in custody since he was arrested over the attack. His friend Jason McReynolds, 20, of Saundersfoot, had tried to help him escape.

He was given a 12 month supervision order and told to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work for attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Mr Rogers' family, who are from Saundersfoot, have been told by doctors that their son may never recover from the assault. They continue to hold a bedside vigil at Neath Port Talbot Hospital in South Wales.
