Six months after Florida teenager Davion Only asked a church full of strangers to help him find a real home - he still has not been adopted.

Criticism of Eckerd, the adoption agency charged with finding the now 16-year-old boy an adoptive family has grown - with many potential parents claiming that their phone calls have never been returned.

It is even alleged that the teenager who toured morning and national talk shows in September is no longer allowed to speak to the media, has no cellphone or email and has put his Facebook settings on private.

Indeed, the young-man - who captured the
 heart of the nation with his heart-breaking request last year - has 
grown despondent with those who know him saying that he 'just wants the 
whole process to be over'.

Still without a family: Davion Only, 16, who has spent his whole life in foster care and begged for anyone to adopt him at his church

The teenager made his stark, simple and emotional plea stood at the pulpit in September at the age of 15 wearing a donated suit and clutching a Bible he had borrowed from his boy's home.

'My name is Davion,' he said. 'And I’ve been in foster care since I was born.

He told the congregation: 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be… I know God hasn't given up on me. So I'm not giving up either.'

Davion told the church he never knew his real family and that he hoped for a home.

He was featured on Good Morning America, Al Jazeera America and in People. Producers flew him in to speak with Barbara Walters in New York on The View. About 10,000 people around the globe called to ask about helping or adopting him.

Davion has since moved out of a group home and into a foster one as reported by the MailOnline in December, but sadly, he still does not have a permanent home or adoptive parents.

'Something doesn’t seem right. I pray about it,' said his mentor, Richard Prince, 22.

'He’s changed schools and foster homes, and he’s not allowed to tell me certain things. People want to hear a happy ending, but it’s not too clear what’s going on.'

More than 300 people contacted the Times last fall saying they couldn’t get in touch with anyone at Davion’s foster agency, Eckerd.

The Tampa Bay Times contacted a sample of 40 of those potential parents. Of the 10 who responded, nine said they had not heard from Eckerd.

'We never received a response. This just breaks my heart,' wrote Marcy Theobald of Georgia to the Tampa Bay Times.

'What is wrong with the system?! Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and loved.'

'No one has contacted me regarding Davion,' Shelly Bergman wrote from Ohio.

'I just don't understand it, and I sure hope he does not lose his faith because of that. This sweet young man just wants to be loved by someone. Bring him here, I will welcome him with open arms.'

The paper were also contacted by Sharron Furno and her husband in Michigan. They run a license foster home and have four other adopted children.

Out of the 40 people the Tampa Bay Times contacted, she was the only one who had received any response from Ekcerd.

'I received an email stating that they were only considering families in the state,' Furno wrote.

'We offered to pay for his transportation. I offered to go to Florida and spend time with him. Why leave him there when they haven't been able to give him permanency in years?'

An Eckerd spokeswoman said Davion was meeting with prospective adoptive families and that the process would take time.

Some adoptions experts say they are not surprised that an adoption has taken so long, but other children’s advocates are appalled.

'The poor kid has got to be wondering, ‘Why, out of all those people, does no one want me?’ Dr. Gregory Keck, a psychologist who has spent 25 years working with foster and adopted children said.

Davion started to look for his mother, whom he 
had never met, using his birth certificate at a local library in June.

According to Florida's Department of Children and Families, adoption of a child from foster care should take between nine months and a year.

'I know Eckerd is committed to finding Davion the forever family that is perfect for him,' said interim Secretary Esther Jacobo.

'The relationship cannot be forced or rushed.'

In December it seemed that the teen was on the brink of a breakthrough.

He was introduced to a prospective adoptive family. Eckerd spokesperson Terri Durdaller said, 'He has moved from his group home placement at Carlton Manor to a foster home where he is enjoying getting to know the family. Davion is excited to be spending the holidays with a perspective adoptive family.'

However, still the teenage boy has not been found a permanent home. Durdaller said some media had misunderstood.

'The foster and adoptive parents are two separate systems,' said Durdaller.

'He is in a foster home, things are more stable there. Sometimes a foster parent will adopt. But he is meeting with different perspective adoptive families. We have 15 years of his life to catch a family up on. That takes time.'

Indeed, some adoption experts said that they aren't surprised that Davion still hasn't been adopted.

'It isn't easy,' said Bob Rooks, who directs Explore Adoption, Florida's adoption referral center in Jacksonville to the Tampa Bay Times.

'Of all those 10,000 calls, probably only a small percentage already were qualified to adopt. And at his age, he has his own opinions. Maybe his needs were different from what those families wanted.'

Connie Going, the Eckerd adoptions specialist who took Davion to church back in September has called him 'a forgotten child.'

'I have to believe everything is going to be okay in the long run,' said Going. 'I think he just wants it all to be over.'

Indeed, Going now alleges that Davion is not allowed to speak to the media anymore - despite the huge publicity tour that Eckerd allowed him to go on in September.

For their part, Eckerd said that Davion has so far met with four prospective families and that they are hopeful the right fit has been found.

'It was decided that one family has the skills needed to care for him,' she wrote in an email to the Tampa Bay Times.

'All qualified families that did express an interest in adopting Davion were explored,' Durdaller wrote in February.

She won't reveal where the family lives, or anything about them.
