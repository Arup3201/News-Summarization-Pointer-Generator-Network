A blind woman who is unable to have children of her own has created her own family using lifelike dolls.

Louise Keel, 46, from Caerphilly, South Wales, was heartbroken after finding out she couldn't have children of her own - but found comfort in a £1,000 doll of a curly-haired toddler as well as two other 'babies' and a chimpanzee.

Appearing with her doll Bert, who she helped create, on ITV’s This morning, Louise revealed how her dolls have helped filled a void in her life.

Louise says her lifelike dolls have helped her come to terms with the fact that she can't have children of her own

Louise and her husband Brian even used Bert as a pageboy at their wedding

Registered blind and suffering from osteoporosis, Louise treats  Bert like a real child, to the extent that she had him as a pageboy at her wedding to partner Brian, 48.

‘I’ve always desperately wanted children. I had baby dolls as a baby girl, I had tea sets, I played house,' she said.

‘I always thought it would be marriage and family. That’s all I ever wanted out of life.’

However, after marrying at the age of 22, Louise endured six gruelling years of fertility treatment.

‘After so long, you then have to decide to stop. You have to decide are you going to go on and on and on. And it’s heartbreaking. But you have to decide for the sake of your own sanity.’

Louise says that adopting wasn’t an option due to her disability, but her life changed on a trip to New York in 2005.

‘I was in a big toy store looking at the dolls. One of the sales assistants asked if I wanted to hold a baby doll.

‘I picked it up and I was smitten.  It weight about four pounds, it was about 19 inches long.

‘It felt so lifelike, like a real baby. I thought, "I’ve never felt like this before, I’ve got to have it."’

Louise says that her dolls have had a profound and positive effect on her health.

Louise, who has several medical conditions, says that as well as helping her deal with not being able to have children, her dolls help with her pain

‘I found then and I find now that on bad days, when pain meds won’t touch my health issues I could hold one of the babies and they would help take the edge off.

‘It is a really amazing, amazing feeling.’

Though she says initially she never thought she would take her doll out in public, when she acquired a second doll her attitude changed.

‘In 2009 I got a little boy and I thought well, I see all these nice things on websites.

‘I got a bottle and thought let’s just see what it feels like, and it’s an amazing thing.

‘I just did a little bit at first, I fed him and it was a lovely feeling.

‘The way I describe it is it filled a hole inside me that I hadn’t released was empty. It just gave me a feeling of completion.'

As well as Bert Louise has two other lifelike dolls, Leah-Rose (right) and Cassidy-Anne (left) who are babies

Bert, who appears with Louise on This Morning was created based on a character from a script by her writer husband.

Louise helped design him and gave him the pixie ears as his character in the stories is a lepricorn.

She also has two other lifelike dolls, known as reborns. They are named Leah-Rose and Cassidy-Anne, and both are babies. She buys them presents, sings them lullabies to get them to sleep and takes them out to the park.  

The silicone dummies are hand-picked for their realistic weight and soft feel but they lack the sounds - and smells - of a real baby.

Nonetheless every morning she wakes up early to warm bottles of formula and feed her family. Her home is filled with all the equipment new mothers need, including baby bouncers, bottles and comforter blankets.

‘If Brian is around the house and not away on a business trip then obviously he’s the real person in the house and he gets the attention,’ Louise explains.

‘But if I’m on my own it’s cool to be able to do things with the babies; to feed them and change them and cuddle them.

Despite receiving negative comments about her dolls, Louise says she has gone public with her passion because many others are too scared to admit they love reborns.

‘I’ve met so many people who have said I’d love to do what you do, I’d love to have reborns and take them out but I’m too scared.

‘I’m not hurting anyone and its help me come to terms with not being a mother.

But it’s done so much more than that. It’s brought me so much joy and so much help. It’s been such a force for good.’

The latest member of Louise’s family is a reborn chimpanzee named Ozzy and she says she will definitely be continuing to add to her clan.

‘In January, another little girl is coming who’s going to be about the size of a nine month old, 26 inches long, so a little smaller than Bert.’
