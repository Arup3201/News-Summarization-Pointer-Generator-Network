Summer has kicked into full gear a little early across much of the nation with the south east of Australia copping the worst of a sweltering heatwave that has hit much of New South Wales.

The temperature in Richmond, western Sydney recorded a record high of 45.2C, the hottest day since 1982 when the mercury reached 43.6C. 

Peter Zmijewski, senior meteorologist at Bureau of Meteorology, told Daily Mail Australia that the high temperatures were not unseasonal but because of the changing seasons. 

He said: 'This time of the year it’s a transition in the season and there are a lot of adjustments going on, this is why we can experience very hot and cold in the same day.

'This year seems to be on the hotter side than others, Richmond had its hottest day since 1982. It got so hot because we had a very low pressure troth moving the hot air from north western Australia down to NSW and the east coast. 

'Tomorrow is going to be hot in the north eastern part of the state will still have pretty high temperatures. Normal temperatures for this time of year are 27C inland and about 23C in the coastal areas.

'The steam fog which we saw across Sydney today could have been caused by many factors but we don't know the exact cause of this phenomenon. It does not matter how hot or cold it is and they can happen at any time of day, why they appear is not simple.'  

After a day of relief following Friday's sizzler, Sydney is again sweating due to a mass of hot air that moved across state which has also caused more than 50 fires to burn out of control across the state. 

This morning some coastal residents also woke to a mysterious fog but weather experts have put it down to just condensed cloud close to the water which can be caused by a range of factors including humidity and temperature. 

The city's forecasted temperature was to reach the mid- to high 30s on Sunday, while Penrith and Richmond have already tipped the thermometer at their forecast of 43C at around 4pm.

Meanwhile in the Hunter region, the small town of Cessnock reached a blistering 43.6 Sunday afternoon and Scone, 41.4, while in the upper west, Bourke no doubtedly melted its residents at a scorching 43.7 at around 4pm.

'There's a build up of heat due to the clear sunny days which has allowed heat to build,' said Weatherzone meteorologist Kim Westcott.

'The heat is slowly moving ahead of a slow pressure trough.'

'It's not unusual, it's the summer pattern arriving and we have a lot of moisture in the air,' said Ms Westcott. 

Earlier she said she expected the western parts of Sydney could break some records with Richmond, which hadn't ever seen a 43 degree day since records dated back to 1993, but that has been smashed.

Penrith has also already recorded the hottest November day since 1995.

Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Peter Zmijewski said we should see a change later Sunday night.

He said a change would move through the west and southwest during the day, 'so some places will feel a little bit of relief towards the late afternoon'. 

'We'll see a north easterly wind about the coast and a change tonight at around 8pm,' said Ms Westcott.

'Monday looking at a low pressure trough bringing showers and storms in afternoon and evening but it will still be quite warm.' 

But the heat stretched far and wide to Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland although it skipped Victoria.

Broome hovered just below it's forecast top of 35 degrees at around four oc'lock, Alice Springs surpassed it's top to reach 39 degrees and a usually mild Canberra also surprisingly reached its expected top of 38 degrees.

Much of Queensland's coastal areas reached in the low to mid 30s while Mt Isa sizzled at almost 41 degrees and Adelaide is cruising along below its forecast although the heatwave did make its way to other parts of the state including Coober Pedy and Roxby Downs in the high 30s.

The heat has also fuelled 51 fires burning across state, with three fires at watch and act stage.

The NSW RFS says they included large grass fires at the central west region, in Parkes, Tullamore and Ungarie (300 hectares) and the mid western highway Weethalle fire (200 hectare).

'Currently there a number of fire crews out at these locations performing water bombing attacks and property protection,' said Matt Sun from the RFS.

'At the Tullamore road fire, residents did not have to relocate and there was no property loss. Crews have been working several hours and we are hopeful of containing them, but will be providing constant updates.'

'There's strong winds but we are expecting southerly changes bit later and will wait to see tomorrow for conditions to ease off.' he said.

Tomorrow it's expected a fire ban will be placed on the Central West Plains.  

The Bureau of Meteorology also forecast a severe fire danger rating for central and southern parts of Western Australia Sunday.

The warning remains in place to stay alert and watch for signs of fire, especially smoke and flames advising people to have their bushfire survival plan and kit ready.
