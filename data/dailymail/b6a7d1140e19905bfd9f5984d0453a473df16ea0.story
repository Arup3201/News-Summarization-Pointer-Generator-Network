More than a million callers failed to get through to a police hotline last year while some people were left waiting more than an hour to speak to someone about a crime.

Shocking statistics revealed 1,071,939 calls to the non-emergency 101 phone number were abandoned or dropped in the last year, an increase of 26 per cent on the previous 12 months.

New figures show that more than a quarter of people calling the lines in some areas either hung up or were cut off before they managed to speak to anyone with information about an incident.

The 101 number was introduced with a fanfare across Britain from 2011 to replace individual police station numbers and reduce the number of time-consuming 999 calls when something was not an emergency.

The latest figures, gleaned from Freedom of Information answers, show the number of calls in the year to September fell by 113,640 to just over 41million.

But only a few forces were achieving their own targets of answering 90 per cent of calls within 30 seconds. Elected crime tsars have branded the service is some parts of the UK ‘completely unacceptable’.

John O'Connell, director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It was claimed the 101 line would save money and reduce pressure on the emergency services, but the service is simply not performing and the promised benefits won't appear as a result.

'Each call centre costs money, and right now taxpayers aren't seeing value for money. We need to improve 101 service significantly by finding inefficiencies in the system, or look at whether it is worth continuing.'

Policing Minister Mike Penning said: ‘Police forces are responsible for ensuring 101 calls are answered'

Sam Clayton, from Bradford, said he made several unsuccesful attempts to contact West Yorkshire Police on the 101 number when he saw a group of yobs stealing metal from his neighbour’s garden.

He said: ‘I’d spent just over 60 minutes on hold. Then the call seemed to be answered, then I was cut off. It is extremely frustrating. I spent so long on hold.

‘It just leaves me wondering how many people are the victims of crime in that area who just give in.’

One person calling the line in Lancashire waited an hour and 18 minutes for an answer, while someone ringing Greater Manchester Police waited one hour nine minutes.

The average time taken to answer a call to Sussex Police's 101 line in June was nearly four minutes, figures show.

The police forces with the quickest average answer time were Wiltshire, North Wales, Lincolnshire, Essex and the City of London, where calls were typically picked up after seven seconds.

Tony Hogg, the Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner, claimed most people his area waited between 10 and 20 minutes before speaking to an operator, although the force said 93 per cent of calls were answered within 30 seconds.

He said: ‘Most people are calling because they want to give some intelligence to the police, but how frustrating must it be not to be able to do that easily.’

Policing Minister Mike Penning said: ‘Police forces are responsible for ensuring 101 calls are answered within their local service standards. We are working with forces to support them to identify where improvements can be made.’
