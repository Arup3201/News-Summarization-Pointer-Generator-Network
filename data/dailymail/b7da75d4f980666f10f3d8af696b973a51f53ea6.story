Amber Jay Vinson, the second nurse to be diagnosed with Ebola, had a lo-grade fever and boarded a flight from Cleveland, Ohio, to Dallas, anyway -  just hours before she was hospitalized with the deadly disease.

Now, CDC officials are trying to track down all 132 passengers who were aboard Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 on Monday with Ms Vinson over fears they could all have been exposed to the virus. 

Ms Vinson traveled home to Ohio to plan her wedding and visit her mother last Friday, despite being one of the 76 medical workers from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital under observation by the Centers for Disease Control. 

She had treated Thomas Eric Duncan, the Ebola 'patient zero.' Health officials say she was told she was at risk for exposure to the disease but flew on a commercial airline anyway.

Everyone who was on board the plane is urged to call 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636) so that they can be interviewed by CDC doctors to determine who is at risk for possible exposure to Ebola.

Ms Vinson is currently in stable condition at Texas Presbyterian Hospital, though doctors are preparing to transfer her to an infectious disease ward at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. 

She flew home to her family in Northeast Ohio on Friday, despite CDC advice that says people being monitored for Ebola should stay away from public transportation, officials said. 

'She should not have traveled on a commercial airline,' CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden said in a news conference today. 

Dr Frieden, however, did not say whether she was told not to travel by CDC officials.  

Ms vinson was on Flight 1143 returning to Dallas just hours before reporting the first symptoms of Ebola. 

'Because of the proximity in time between the evening flight and first report of illness the following morning, CDC is reaching out to passengers,' the agency said in a statement.

She had a fever of 99.5 degrees, though patients are told not to be concerned about Ebola symptoms until the fever reached 101.5 degrees.

Patients infected with Ebola are not contagious until after they begin to show symptoms - which can take anywhere from two days to three weeks. 

Public health officials are concerned that Ms Vinson may have been contagious on the flight.  

Flight 1143 took off from Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport about 6.30pm eastern time on Monday and landed shortly after 8pm at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.  

The next morning, she showed up to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital with a fever. She was isolated and tested for Ebola. Positive test results came back today.

Frontier said it is disinfecting the plane that carried Ms Vinson and has removed it from service - though not before it made four more flights around the country

The plane Ms Vinson flew on when she may have been contagious made four more flights full of passengers before it was removed from service. The plane returned to Cleveland from Dallas, then flew to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Intentional Airport in Florida, then to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport

CDC officials have refused to offer an exact timeline for when Ms Vinson began experiencing symptoms - though it's likely less than 12 hours between the time she was on the plane to the time she showed up at the hospital.

The plane that carried Ms Vinson has been removed from service and disinfected twice. However, it made five more flights with passengers before the CDC notified Frontier of the possible Ebola exposure.

On Tuesday morning, the plane, an Airbus A320, took off from Dallas and returned to Cleveland. It then flew to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport then back to Cleveland. Then Cleveland to  Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson, the busiest airport in the world, and back to Ohio. 

It returned to service later today and lifted off for Denver this afternoon. WKYC-TV showed a picture of the aircraft, believed to be the plane in question at a boarding gate at the Cleveland airport.  

The CDC has not said anyone on those flights is at risk of catching the virus and has emphasized that 'the risk is very low' even for the passengers on the Frontier Airlines flight. 

WHEN IS EBOLA CONTAGIOUS?

Only when someone is showing symptoms, which can start with vague symptoms including a fever, flu-like body aches and abdominal pain, and then vomiting and diarrhea.

HOW DOES EBOLA SPREAD?

Through close contact with a symptomatic person's bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat, vomit, feces, urine, saliva or semen. Those fluids must have an entry point, like a cut or scrape or someone touching the nose, mouth or eyes with contaminated hands, or being splashed. That's why health care workers wear protective gloves and other equipment.

The World Health Organization says blood, feces and vomit are the most infectious fluids, while the virus is found in saliva mostly once patients are severely ill and the whole live virus has never been culled from sweat.

The Texas Department of State Health Services said Sunday that a health-care worker who provided hospital care for the first patient to die from Ebola in the United States has tested positive for the virus. The worker was not identified and it was unclear what level of care the worker provided or when the health worker came into contact with the patient. It is the first known case of Ebola being transmitted in the U.S.

WHAT ABOUT MORE CASUAL CONTACT?

Ebola isn't airborne. Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said people don't get exposed by sitting next to someone on the bus.

'This is not like flu. It's not like measles, not like the common cold. It's not as spreadable, it's not as infectious as those conditions,' he added.

WHO GETS TESTED WHEN EBOLA IS SUSPECTED?

Hospitals with a suspected case call their health department or the CDC to go through a checklist to determine the person's level of risk. Among the questions are whether the person reports a risky contact with a known Ebola patient, how sick they are and whether an alternative diagnosis is more likely. Most initially suspicious cases in the U.S. haven't met the criteria for testing.

HOW IS IT CLEANED UP?

The CDC says bleach and other hospital disinfectants kill Ebola. Dried virus on surfaces survives only for several hours.

The Ebola virus has survived on surfaces for up to six days in lab experiments, though most studies suggest it can on live a few hours.

Ms Vinson is the second nurse who cared for Duncan to be diagnosed with Ebola. Nurse Nina Pham, 26, came down with the illness this weekend. Both women are at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, which treated Duncan as well.

Vinson is being transferred to a special infectious disease unit, one of four in the country, for treatment. It is believed that she will soon be flown to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which treated the first American Ebola patients Dr Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol.  

Duncan, a Liberian national, died last week after becoming the first person to bring the Ebola to the United States from West Africa, where it has killed nearly 4,500 people.  

Stocks in major airlines slumped 4 to 6 percent in morning trading after the announcement. Republic Airways, Frontier's parent company, tumbled 4.7percent.
