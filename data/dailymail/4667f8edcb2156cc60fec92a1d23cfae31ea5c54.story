West Ham striker Andy Carroll and fiancee Billi Mucklow could not contain their excitement as they soaked up the sun just weeks before becoming parents for the first time.

After jetting off to Abu Dhabi as Carroll recovers from knee surgery, the pair posed for a photograph in their snazzy swim wear.

The 26-year-old is set to miss the rest of the season after being forced off through injury during the Hammers' goalless draw with Southampton in February.

Billi had caused fans to believe she might be expecting more than one child in a recent tweet as she gushed: ‘The Triplets Are Coming #triplets.’

The 26 year old even put three baby emoji's alongside her social media post.

As expected, Billi sent her fans into a frenzy when she announced the news of her possible triplets on Twitter with one asking: ‘Omg really?!’

However, it turns out Billi was just watching a TV show called The Triplets Are Coming!.

Billi broke the news of her pregnancy on Christmas Day by donning a festive jumper with the words 'making my little pudding' in an Instagram snap with West Ham United footballer Andy, who posted the picture : 'Merry Christmas #OurLittlePudding.'

The England international already has two children, a daughter Emilie Rose aged four, and a two-year-old son Lucas.
