Tony Blair has insisted he is not the reason for the delay in publication of the Chilcot Inquiry.

The former prime minister said he resented suggestions that he was holding up the investigation into the Iraq war, which is four years late in delivering its conclusions.

He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘It certainly isn’t me who is holding it up.

Tony Blair denies that confidential notes between him and George Bush are delaying a report into the war

'The sooner it is published the better from my  perspective as it allows me to go and make the arguments.

‘I don’t know what the reason for the delay is because I’m not in charge of the inquiry and not in charge of the Government.

‘All I can tell you is it is not for me and I resent the suggestion that it is.

'I have got as much interest as  anyone in seeing the inquiry publish its findings and then being able to go out and frankly restate my case and defend my position.’

Delay: The investigation into the Iraq war is four years late in delivering its conclusions

The confidential status of notes and conversations between the former Labour leader and then US president George W Bush are reportedly to blame for the delay.

Mr Blair said: ‘Just so that it is absolutely clear, of course the inquiry has had all these documents for a long period of time.

‘Obviously there are a whole set of issues of confidentiality that have to be resolved.

'As I understand it, the Government is resolving them, so let us wait and see.’
