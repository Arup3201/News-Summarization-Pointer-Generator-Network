Andrew Flintoff has escaped a driving ban for speeding in his Bentley after arguing 'exceptional hardship' to magistrates.

Flintoff, 36, was already on nine points for speeding and in danger of an automatic ban with another three points after admitting being behind the wheel when flashed by a camera doing 87mph on the M6, near Linstock, Cumbria on January 28 this year, Carlisle Magistrates' Court heard.

But JPs accepted a ban would amount to exceptional hardship because of the effect on others who rely on his extensive charity work and the privacy of his three children.

Instead, the former England captain, caught speeding four times in the last three years, was given the three points on his licence and fined £330 but allowed to keep driving.

His solicitor Michael Neofytou, told the court a ban would also affect his TV work - with the defendant due to be filming a show on Friday in Northern Ireland, a 'road trip' where he drives a fish and chips van powered by the van's cooking fat.

Flintoff, who played for Lancashire in their NatWest t20 Blast final defeat to Birmingham Bears at Edgbaston last weekend, sat listening to his solicitor outline his case for most of the 45 minute hearing.

He was warned after arguing exceptional hardship he would not be able to use the same reasons again in court if he was caught speeding again in the next three years.
