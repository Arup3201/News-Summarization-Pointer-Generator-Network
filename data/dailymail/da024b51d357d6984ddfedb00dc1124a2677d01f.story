A model has been struck down by a rare condition which means she faints every time she stands up.

Chelsey Reynolds, from Witham, Essex, went from living an active life as a trainee nurse and part time model to being permanently confined to a wheelchair in a matter of hours.

The 22-year-old suffers from a condition known as Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS), which means that every time she stands up, her heart rate speeds up, causing her to pass out.

Chelsey's PoTS is so severe that she has had to learn to walk on her knees around the house, and even carries a small stool with her wherever she goes.

Out of the blue: Chelsey's sudden onset of PoTS was a mystery to doctors. She went from working 15 hours a day to being unable to stand for even a very short period of time

Doctors have been baffled by the sudden onset of PoTS and are still at a loss as to why Chelsey suffers from it.

Chelsey
 said: 'It all happened absolutely out of the blue. One minute I was 
working, rushing about and getting on with things, and the next thing I 
knew I'd fainted.

'From that moment on everything was different and I haven't been able to stand up since.

'I have to use my wheelchair whenever I go out, and I've learnt to get about on my knees or my bum around the house.

'It's
 all just so surreal. I'd never been ill or been to hospital before 
this. I feel like I'm living in a weird parallel universe.'

Chelsey was working on the stroke ward at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford hospital when she began feeling ill.

Chelsey went from leading an active life as a trainee nurse and part-time model before being being struck down by a rare condition which means she faints every time she stands up

'I had a 15 hour shift ahead of me on the ward and I was just getting started.

'I felt fine and then all of a sudden felt faint. I hadn't had breakfast so I assumed it was that.

'I went to the staff room to grab something to eat, and when I came back out I fainted.

'Everyone ran towards me and the next thing I knew I'd been taken to A&E. Apparently I was unresponsive and people were really worried.

'It was like a dream. It was all so scary, I had no idea what was happening to me.'

After various tests, Chelsey was sent home and told to go to her GP for a check up in 24 hours time.

She added: 'It was horrible. Every time I stood up for even the shortest period of time I had an overwhelming feeling that I was going to faint.

Doctors are baffled and are still at a loss as to why Chelsey suffers from the condition

'I was asked to do some simple tests 
like pushing on the doctor's hands and standing up for a short period of
 time - but as soon as I stood up I heard the doctor utter the word 
PoTS.'

Chelsey then faced a long wait whilst test results were gathered and a diagnosis was made.

She said: 'I was starting to model, going to the gym lots and training to be a nurse, and now all of a sudden I had to sit down to brush my teeth. I couldn't even sit up in bed.

'I used to work for 15 hours and then go on a night out - there's no way I could do that now.

'I'm always the lively loud one, so for my family to see such a change in me it was really hard.

'I got my wheelchair and then a mobility scooter, and everything was different.'

'I had three days of tests and they were gruelling. I was strapped to a tilt table and put in a standing position until I passed out.

After being diagnosed with PoTS, Chelsey met her boyfriend Ashley, who she says has been supportive of her

'After the tests I was finally given a
 diagnosis in October last year. I then had to wait another six months 
for a follow-up appointment, where I've been put on a course of 
medication to try and deal with the PoTS.

'It's
 a waiting game at the moment to see if any medication will work but I 
always try to look on the bright side and hope for the best.'

Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS) can be a life altering and debilitating chronic health condition.  

Simply standing up can be a challenge for people with PoTS as their body is unable to adjust to gravity.

PoTS is characterised by what's 
known as orthostatic intolerance - the development of symptoms when 
upright that are relieved by lying down.

Symptoms include headaches, fatigue, palpitations, sweating, nausea, fainting and dizziness.

They are associated with an increase in heart rate from the lying to upright position of greater than 30 beats per minute, or a heart rate of greater than 120 beats per minute within 10 minutes of standing.

But despite the condition, Chelsey maintains a positive outlook, and has even started a YouTube
 channel where she hopes to raise awareness of PoTS and her journey with
 it.

'It was tricky at first but I still try and live as normal life as possible,' she says.

'I really missed getting to go out and go dancing with my friends, but luckily my friend's husband is a bouncer at a nightclub.

'He was able to carry me into the club, and get me sat down - I stayed on the same chair all night but it was amazing.

'I even met my boyfriend, Ashley that night. We started chatting and it was great because you'd never have guessed that I had anything wrong with me.

'Ashley's been so supportive about my condition. Going on a first date in a wheel chair was pretty daunting, but it didn't seem to phase him.

'We've never walked hand in hand, which is something most couples take for granted, but we have a great relationship all the same.

'In an ideal world I'd wake up one morning and be fine again. I hope that it will go away as quickly as it started.

'But in the mean time I'll try my best to live as normally as I can.

'I want other PoTS sufferers to know that they're not alone.'
