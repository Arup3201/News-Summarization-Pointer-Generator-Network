One seems bent on world domination, a powerful media manipulator capable of influencing the lives of millions. The other is a North Korean dictator.

But it seems reality TV star Kim Kardashian and ruthless Kim Jong-Un have a previously unknown common hobby – a love of ski-ing

As the Kardashian family posed for paparazzi in designer ski wear, North Korea's Kim Jong-Un was also creating his own stage-managed image at the secretive country's newly-opened ski resort.

The leader took a test ride on one of the
 new lifts at Masik Pass Ski Resort but as he sat surveying the resort 
it appeared he had forgotten his skis.

Kim Kardashian was well kitted out however, in a full black ensemble and skis.

Jong-Un was said to note 'with great 
satisfaction' that everything was 'impeccable' and gave instructions to 
serve people well to ensure visitors may 'keenly feel the loving care of
 the party', local media reported.

Meanwhile, Kim Kardashian joined Kanye West and her sister Kourtney in Utah.

Dressed up like The Invisible Man, the 36-year-old rapper is thought to have accompanied Kim and Kourtney for some fun on the slopes.

The reality TV star barely had a hair out of place as she wrapped up in a furry jacket and donned some pristine goggles. 

Kourtney looked equally stylish in a fur-lined coat and aviator shades.

The leader, who was educated in 
Switzerland, told officials to hold the opening ceremony at the resort 
at the earliest opportunity, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.

The
 ski resort was described as KCNA as a 'great monumental structure in 
the era of Songun', referring to the nation's 'military first' policy. 
The military played a leading role in the project.

He
 was accompanied by top military leaders and, Pak Myong-Choi, a top 
sports official known to be associated with Kim's uncle who was executed
 this month.

The Masik Pass Ski Resort made headlines in August when Switzerland blocked a $7.6 million sale of ski lifts to Pyongyang, calling it a 'propaganda project' for the impoverished Stalinist regime.

Featuring 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level ski runs, a hotel, heliport and cable cars, the resort has been heavily promoted since Kim visited it in June and called for construction to be completed by the end of the year.

Warming up: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West enjoy smores around the fire with their family

The Kardashians stayed closer to home though and enjoyed sliding down the slopes before warming up with smores next to a fire pit.

Kim Jong-Un has shown a fondness for expensive, high-profile leisure projects in and around the showpiece capital Pyongyang including a massive new water park, an amusement park and a luxury horseback riding club.

The Munsu Water Park in Pyongyang opened in October to much fanfare, with the 109,000-square metre venue sporting dozens of indoor and outdoor pools, water slides and saunas.

Kim in September also watched films at a new '4D' movie theatre built in the newly-renovated Rungna People's amusement park, state media reported earlier.

He was photographed riding a roller coaster in the Rungna amusement park in Pyongyang when it reopened in July 2012 after renovations ordered by Kim.
