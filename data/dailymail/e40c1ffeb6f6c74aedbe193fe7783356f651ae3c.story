Australia prides itself on the world-class calibre of its New Years Eve celebrations, but global figures show that Australians are the first bed when the partying ends.

Using statistics from trackers in wearable technology, the night owls and the early worms have been identified in a possibly surprising list.

While cities in Russia and the Ukraine stay up past 3.30am on New Years Eve, Australians hit the hay at an average bedtime of 12.53am.

Russia reportedly combines many festive holidays such as Christmas and New Years Eve together into a 'super holiday', reports Jawbone, who compiled the study. 

With the option of fireworks at 9pm as well as midnight, the early bedtime might be a result of the early celebration options Australians can choose to enjoy.

Australia is in good company with China and Israel, who also head to bed early, fuelling up to celebrate traditions which span for hundreds of years: Chinese New Year and Rosh Hashanah.  

Famous party cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Sao Paulo, and Santiago all ranked in the top 20, with bedtimes that varied between 2.45am and 3.07am.

It was worth the wait for the 1.6 million punters who arrived as early as the morning of New Year's Eve to ensure they had prime position for the spectacular annual event, which attracts party-goers from all over the world.

It was a light-filled celebration, with a 12-storey bulb illuminated on the Harbour Bridge in recognition of 2015 being the International Year of Light and Light Technologies.

The massive crowd cheered with delight as the explosion of colour and lights continually lit up the shoreline, to see in 2015 in spectacular style.

A highlight was the pyrotechnic display cascading from the world-renowned coat-hanger, resembling an enormous flowing waterfall.
