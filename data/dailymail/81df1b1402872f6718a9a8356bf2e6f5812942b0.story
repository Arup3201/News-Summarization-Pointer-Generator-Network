Borussia Dortmund may have been comfortably beaten by Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, but even in defeat they were moral winners.

The struggling Bundesliga outfit lost 2-0 in their Champions League group stage match in north London, but rather than sulk off down the tunnel, they went and greeted their travelling supporters at the away end of the stadium.

The players leapt over hoardings to meet their fans before shaking hands and thanking them for their support on a disappointing night for Jurgen Klopp's team.

Despite their side looking off colour, Dortmund supporters were happy with the gesture from their players and applauded the players as they approached them and greeted them. 

Dortmund could have won the group if they had secured a draw at the Gunners but goals from Yaya Sanogo and Alexis Sanchez gave Arsene Wenger's team a deserved 2-0 win at the Emirates Stadium.

The German outfit now go into the final matchday knowing only victory against Anderlecht will guarantee them reaching the last 16 as group winners.

Despite having already reached the knock-out rounds in Europe, it's in stark contrast to the German's side domestic form, with Klopp's outfit currently third from bottom in the German top flight.
