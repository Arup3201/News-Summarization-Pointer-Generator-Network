A lesbian intent on stopping her former lover seeing the children they had together with donated sperm has been warned by the UK's top family judge to stop poisoning them against their other mother.

The former couple have spent 10 years and more than £200,000 battling eachother in one of Britain's most bitter custody battles, London's Appeal Court heard.

Their children, 11 and 13, have no memory of their mothers not being at eachother's throats in an entrenched dispute that has been to the Court of Appeal three times and the House of Lords once.

Referring to the 'lamentable history' of the case yesterday, top family judge, 
Lord Justice Thorpe, said that every attempt by the courts and social 
workers to make the former lovers see sense and agree reasonable child 
contact arrangements had been doomed to failure.

Row: The legal battle between the two mothers, which has cost more than £200,000 and lasted a decade is still going (file picture)

The birth mother, who lives in Cornwall and was referred to in court as CG, has 
spent all she has trying to keep her former partner – known as 
CW –  away from their two girls, who were conceived using artificial insemination.

Distraught about not being able to see her daughters, estranged CW headed to court again earlier this year to ask judges to force these girls to move to 
her home in Staffordshire.

Twist: Lord Justice Thorpe yesterday warned the birth mother not to poison her children against their other mother

But Judge Nicholas Vincent ruled this out saying her children no longer thought seeing her was 'valid or worthwhile' and said it was more important that they lived the way they wanted, in Cornwall.

However, in a new twist, the Court of Appeal overturned that decision yesterday as Lord Justice Thorpe said that the girls' view had been tainted by their birth mother, stating there is warmth between the estranged mum and her girls, adding: 'There 
is a clear mismatch between what these children say and how they behave.'

He went on the children are 'no doubt well aware of their mother’s antipathy towards CW and their 
wishes, although important, should not be taken too literally.

'She has always been a warm and loving parent who has never failed these children.'

Social workers said there is 'natural warmth' between CW and the girls
and Justice Thorpe said: 'A subtle but familiar strategy is for the primary carer to declare 
that it is for the children to decide, and they go whenever they please,
whilst at the same time projecting a clear message that she does not 
wish or expect them to go.

'It is also my view that the judge (Vincent) did not sufficiently factor in the
crucial importance of the relationship between the children and CW and 
her family and the damage that would be caused to them by its loss.'

Relentless: The case has now been going since 2002 and has been to the High Court (pictured), Appeal Court and House of Lords as the lesbians battle for custody

Laying down a warning to CG of where her stubborness may take her, 
the judge added: 'If she cannot sustain the relationship between the 
children and CW then consideration would have to be given to moving them
to CW’s home'.

But rather than settling the matter, it is hurtling headlong back to court, drawing comparison's to the the never-ending Jarndyce vs Jarndyce case at the heart of Dickens' Bleak House, as now CW's application for a residence order over the two girls will now go back for re-hearing by a High Court judge.
