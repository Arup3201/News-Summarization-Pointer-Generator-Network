Lined up  beside a mangled piece of aircraft wreckage, four cuddly toys sit where they have sat for three straight months - a chilling reminder of what happened here 88 days ago today.

The decomposed remains of a number of victims  still lie at the crash site of MH17 in east Ukraine after it was blasted out of the sky by pro-Russian separatists in July.

And, as these grim pictures show, next to nothing has been done to clean up the area in a region still rocked by war. 

Chilling: Lined up beside a mangled piece of aircraft wreckage, four cuddly toys sit where they have sat for three months - a chilling reminder of what happened here on that tragic day

Bodies: The decomposed remains of a number of victims - possibly even the teddies' owners - still lie at the crash site of MH17 in east Ukraine - 88 days since it was blasted out of the sky by pro-Russian separatists

Of 298 passengers who perished aboard the Malaysian Airlines flight on July 17 this year, 26 are still there, unidentified and left to rot in the grass.

Many of their belongings - the personal effects looters could not sell - are still strewn across the field - including books, toothpaste tubes, playing cards, a plastic watch and a stick of antiperspirant. Most of the rest, like the bodies still here, are too badly burned to be identified. 

But finally today, four Dutch experts arrived to help recover the belongings of victims despite fighting between government troops and separatist rebels nearby.

The experts said they were on hand to advise a local Emergencies Ministry team combing the wreckage in the fields where the plane was brought down on July 17, killing all 298 passengers and crew, a Reuters correspondent on the scene said.

Two-thirds of the victims were Dutch nationals and the Dutch Safety Board is in charge of the investigation into how the Boeing 777 was downed.

A short but intense exchange of artillery fire played out near the grassy fields where the team collected the items.

Black smoke rose in the distance less than five km (three miles) away from the site, despite a ceasefire agreed on September 5 between Ukrainian troops and the pro-Russian separatists they are fighting.

Decrease in fighting: Although ceasefire violations have been sporadic around strategically important locations in east Ukraine they have led to a decrease in fighting

Wreckage: An Emergencies Ministry member loads items recovered at the site where the downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crashed, near the village of Hrabove (Grabovo) in Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine

Although ceasefire violations have been sporadic around strategically important locations in east Ukraine they have led to a decrease in fighting.

Emergency Ministry officials loaded the items on a small cargo truck meant to take them from the fields near the village of Hrabove back to the victims' families.

Armed pro-Russian rebels stood around the site while workers from the European rights and security watchdog OSCE monitored the recovery process.

Shot down: The aircraft, which was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, is widely believed to have been hit by a surface-to-air missile fired from territory held by the separatists

At odds: Kiev blames the incident on the rebels and accuses Moscow of arming them. The rebels and Moscow deny the accusations

The Dutch forensics teams in the Netherlands have identified 272 victims of the crash but there are still believed to be remains in the area.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Friday he was furious that Dutch investigators had been unable to finish work in the area because of fighting between the separatists and government forces.

Separatists of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic fighting to split east Ukraine from Kiev on Monday said 36 civilians, including one child, were killed in shelling of the territory under their control last week. More than 3,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
