A plane carrying the body of Korean War POW Glenn Schoenmann arrived at Nashville International Airport in Tennessee on Thursday to be greeted by four emotional siblings, 62 years after their brother voluntarily left home to fight in the war.

Private First Class Schoenmann died in a North Korean prison camp on December 29, 1950, at the age of 20.

He was wounded and suffered days in the frigid cold alone during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, known to Korean War veterans as the ‘frozen Chosin.’

The battle took place in late November 1950 as severe winter weather hit North Korea and hundreds of thousands of Communist Chinese troops poured into the country to overturn what had been a largely successful American and United Nations advance.

Injured and cut off from his unit, Schoenmann managed to avoid being captured for several days. But eventually, wounded and weakened from the cold, the young soldier was caught and detained in a North Korean prison camp, where he died.

His remains were later recovered in 2004 during a brief period of cooperation between the U.S. and North Korea.

Schoenmann’s corpse was identified by DNA taken from family members after a nephew’s online ancestry search came to the attention of U.S. authorities involved in recovering Korean War POW remains, the Leaf Chronicle in Tennessee reports.

His older brother says he remembers driving him to a bus station in Nashville more than 62 years ago.

‘He knew where he was going,’ Ernest Schoenmann, 86, of Creve Coure, Illinois, told the Chronicle. ‘He said, “I don’t think I’ll ever come home alive."

‘That was hard. Those were the last words I can remember.’

Ernest Schoenmann, who was informed of the positive identification shortly before Thanksgiving, said his family learned a lot about what their sibling went through.

‘They gave me a booklet with an interview with one of the boys who was in prison with him,’ he said. ‘I started to read it, but I couldn’t. It was so horrible.’

As with thousands of other U.S. soldiers killed in action or by the harsh conditions of their captivity, Schoenmann’s remains were not returned to the U.S. after authorities signed an armistice with North Korea on July 27, 1953.

Six decades after the signing of that armistice, over 8,000 U.S. military men and women remain unaccounted for.

The Korean War, which was fought between June 25,1950, and July, 27, 1953, has often been referred to as 'The Forgotten War' and 'The Unknown War' due to the lack of public attention it received.

Ernest Schoenmann said he wishes other families of missing Korean War service members will still be able to find closure as their loved ones remain half a world away.

‘I just wish more of them were home,’ he said. ‘There’s still so many of them missing over there.’Glenn Schoenmann’s long-awaited funeral was held in Tennessee on Saturday.
