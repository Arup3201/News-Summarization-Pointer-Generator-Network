Starbucks is entering the soda business, hoping to do to carbonated drinks what it did to coffee: crafting a designer beverage that people will fork over a premium to quaff down on their way to work.

The coffee giant said today that it is launching three flavors of Fizzio Handcrafted Sodas to be concocted by baristas in about a minute and a half at its more than 3,000 locations in 16 states across the southern U.S.

The strategy is timed to coincide with the rising summer temperatures so the cool drinks make up for any decline in hot coffee sales. They will be available beginning on Wednesday.

Starbucks is launching three new handcrafted fizzy drinks tomorrow in an effort to snag a larger slice of the carbonated drinks market

'We are changing the game in terms of how to get a carbonated drink,' Josh Fine, brand manager for Fizzio, told USA Today. 'Like what Starbucks did to coffee 40 years ago, we think we can do in the carbonation space.'

The Fizzio sodas will be carbonated fresh, as opposed to combining syrup with carbonated water like in most commercial machines. Instead, the flavors and spices are combined in a large cheesecloth and steeped in hot water, akin to how tea is made. Buyers can choose from light, standard or extra carbonation.

Starbucks went out of its way in a press release to emphasize that no high fructose corn syrup or preservatives or artificial flavors will be used. A 16 fluid ounce cup ('grande' to a barista) will pack 100 calories or less, it said.

The sodas start out at about $2.45 for a 'tall', compared with $1.80 for the same size coffee, according to USA Today.

The sodas will be made with a machine developed by Starbucks and partner Cornelius that unlike commercial machines doesn't combine carbonated water with syrup

Fizzio lemon ale is a 'refreshing, citrus-forward blend of real lemon juice with hints of apricot and ginger'

The three flavors are:

For those counting grams of sugar, a 'tall' lemon ale contains 21 grams, or about five packets worth, according to The Washington Post. A 'grande' contains about seven packets, while the 'trenta' equals 13, or about 52 grams. 

For Starbucks, it's probably most about snaring a share of the $400 million global carbonated beverage market with a premium product the company hopes appeals to nutrition-conscious Millennials. Homemade soft drinks were called the top beverage trend of 2013 by the National Restaurant Association's annual survey of top chefs.

'Adding new drinking occasions is the key to (Starbucks') growth,' Michael Silverstein, senior partner at the Boston Consulting Group, told USA Today.

About a year ago, Starbucks began testing the sodas in Austin and Atlanta, Fine said.

The sodas will only be available at select locations in the following states: Hawaii, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada and Utah.

A 'tall' will set you back $2.45, a bit pricier than the $1.80 it costs for a similar portion of coffee
