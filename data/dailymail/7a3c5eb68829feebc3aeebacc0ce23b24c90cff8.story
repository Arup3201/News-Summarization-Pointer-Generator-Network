Identified: Lindsay Groce Garder, 27, and her 13-month-old daughter Hailey Gardner were identified as the two bodies found in a Fort Worth, Texas field on Tuesday

The bodies of a naked woman found lying on top of a 1-year-old girl in a field not far from a crashed car have been identified but questions about how the mother and daughter died remain a mystery.

On Wednesday, the Tarrant County medical examiner's office named 27-year-old Lindsay Groce Gardner and her 13-month-old daughter Hailey Gardner as the victims discovered in the Fort Worth, Texas field. 

Ms Gardner lived in an apartment building about five miles away from where her lifeless body was found Tuesday morning by a fence repairman.  

The fence repairman discovered the body just 200 yards away from the scene where police investigated a mysteriously empty crashed car earlier that morning. 

Gardner's clothes were strewn in the field between the car and her body, indicating she undressed as she walked with her baby away from the car.

Investigators now believe that the two incidents are related, but they're still uncertain whether the crash was the cause of death for the mother and daughter since they did not appear to be injured other than a few scratches. It also doesn't explain why they were found so far from the vehicle.   

'There were no injuries that looked like they would cause a person’s death,' Sgt Joe Loughman said. 

The medical examiner's office is still working to determine the cause of death, while police try to pinpoint when the crash happened. 

According to excerpts from a personal blog, published in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Gardner was a married freelance artist who previously lived in California.

Tragic scene: Gardner and her daughter were found about 200 yards away from this crashed car. Investigators believe the two incidents were related, but are still uncertain how the mother and daughter died

In a post from August 2013, she wrote about stress concerning a move to Lancaster, California. 

'Why can’t things just go the way you plan them? Why does God constantly have another path? These are things I get to thinking. You’ve probably thought them before too. Why do we even bother thinking that? He already had a path. 

'It’s our scared insecure brains that try to tie all the knots of false insecurity together into believing that we are going to be ok because of our ‘plan'. Even though, constantly, again and again, our plan fails, falls apart, crumbles, vanishes. But God’s plans are always solid. He always follows through and takes care of us.

'Please pray for me and my family. My husband and I are going back to no home, no job, and pregnant,'  she wrote.

On Wednesday, friends began posting memorials to Gardner on her Facebook page. 

One friend wrote: 'She was such a sweet spirit, so genuine, and an incredible artist. She was so in love with her baby and we both shared a passion for gentle parenting. She wanted to be the best mother she could be for her.' 

Family: According to a personal blog, Gardner was married and worked as a freelance artist. In her last post from April 2013, she wrote about being pregnant and organizing a move to Lancaster, California with her husband Anthony Gardner (pictured above with their daughter) 

Married: Gardner's Facebook profile says she has been married to Anthony Gardner since June 29, 2012 

Mystery: The medical examiner's office is still trying to determine the cause of death for Gardner and her small child

The crashed Toyota sedan was first reported Tuesday morning around 8:30am by resident Amber Bentley, who spotted the car after dropping her kids off at school.

'There's always deer in that field,' Bentley told reporters when she returned to the scene off Dirks Road later that day. 'I was looking for the deer and I saw the car … It was against a tree and the hood was smashed in and the driver's side door was open.

'I was hollering asking if everybody was OK, hoping if somebody was in there that they could at least respond.'

Since Bentley had a child in the car at the time, she couldn't get out to approach the car, but called police and stayed until they showed up. 

While the airbags were deployed, police found the vehicle empty.

It wasn't until a man came to repair a fence at 11am that the bodies were found, about 200 yards away.

The fence repairman came upon the bodies in a field and found the woman naked, lying on top of the child, who was in a car seat, according to sources who spoke with WFAA. 

What happened? Investigators gather at the scene where the bodies were found on Tuesday in Fort Worth 

Undressing: The crashed car was found empty and the bodies 200 yards away. Gardner was found naked, with a trail of clothes from the car suggesting she disrobed as she walked away from the vehicle 

'I cannot comment on why there was a delay between the call that was made and the bodies being found,' Natosha Tucker of the Fort Worth police said Tuesday. 

The mysterious case has rocked the local community, with residents desperate for answers to the seemingly senseless deaths of the mother and child. 

Caroline McLendon, who lives next door to the mother's parents, said she was 'just horrified' to hear about Gardner's death.   

'I wanted to tell her how sorry I was that this has happened to that lovely family,' McLendon told NBC DFW.

Resident Linda Fuqua is confused, like many in the community. 

'It’s perplexing, the fact the bodies were away from the car, you think they would have been in the car,' she said. 'But now I’m wondering, what happened. Was she trying to get away or help herself from the accident with her child?'
