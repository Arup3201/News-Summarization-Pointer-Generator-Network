Former Fulham defender John Arne Riise has blasted under-fire manager Felix Magath.

The 61-year-old German tactician has come under extreme criticism in recent weeks following Fulham's poor run of form in the Championship.

Fulham have failed to claim a single point in their first four Championship games and Riise believes Magath is to blame for their disastrous start to the campaign.

Riise said on Magath: 'With his arrival, they've flushed everything [that club stands for] down the toilet. His methods are ancient.

'Spoke to a few players after the Derby match. Once they returned to London, Magath ordered a team meeting at 10.30pm.

'Then the next morning [which is normally their day off], players were ordered to run for one hour, then another training session at 2.30pm. It's not the way to get the boys going. And training methods are terrible.'

Riise, who is a free agent after leaving Craven Cottage at the end of last season, believes Fulham's top brass are to blame for the west London side's recent demise.

'All football sessions are 11 v 11, working on tactics,' added Riise. 'Interrupted every five minutes. It's a shame, but I fear for Fulham.

'Responsibility lies with Magath and the guys upstairs [directors]. They knew exactly what they were getting with this guy.

'I really like Fulham. It's a real family club with a great stadium, but with Magath everything gets flushed down the toilet.'
