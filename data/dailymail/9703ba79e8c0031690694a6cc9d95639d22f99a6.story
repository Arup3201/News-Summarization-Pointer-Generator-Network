Queens Park Rangers have opened talks with Charlie Austin about offering him a new contract.

The striker hit his first Barclays Premier League hat-trick to help his side come from two goals down to beat West Bromwich Albion at the weekend.

It took his goals tally to 11 in 15 games this season making him the league's leading English goalscorer behind only Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa in the scoring charts.

Austin, still only 25, has 18 months remaining on his current deal which he signed in 2013 when he joined the club in a £4million move from Burnley.

He is fast becoming one of the hottest properties in England and QPR chiefs have started initial discussions with the player's representative about extending his stay.

Both parties are said to be relaxed about the current situation and in no hurry, with a busy set of festive fixtures ahead.

It is understood Austin is set to potentially double his £28,000-per-week deal to between £50,000 and £60,000 and extend it to 2018.

His form this season – his first in the top flight – has attracted attention from England manager Roy Hodgson and his scouts.

Back in November, Hodgson said: ‘I think Charlie Austin is doing very well at QPR and he’s a player we have our eyes on.' Since then, he has netted six goals in six appearances.

There is no doubting his importance to QPR after manager Harry Redknapp admitted they 'might as well go home' if they sold the player and striker partner Bobby Zamora urging the club to extend his stay.
