Spanish police are hunting a driver who posted a video of himself on YouTube overtaking a lorry on a motorway while sitting in the passenger seat of his car.

The video begins by showing a man yawning as he films his face close-up and shouts at someone named 'Javi' to turn down the dance music blasting from the car's stereo.

But as the camera moves away from the man's face, it becomes apparent that he is the only person in the car, and is in fact sat in the passenger seat with his hand outstretched to control the steering.

Reckless: The video begins by showing a man in a passenger seat. As the camera moves away from his face, he is revealed to be the only person in the car, and is driving it with his hand outstretched to control the steering

At one point in the shocking video, the man manages to overtake a lorry before pretending to be scared and then breaking into laughter.

His laughter looks set to be short-lived however, after Spain's National Police stepped up their campaign to track him down - posting a link to the video on their official Twitter page along with the words: 'Don't let anyone play with your life on the roads. We're looking for this man'.

The Twitter account, which uses the handle @policia, is the most popular belonging to a police force anywhere in the world, with 781,000 followers.

Within minutes of the police linking to 
the video on February 22, the man who uploaded it removed it from 
YouTube - but not before a large number of copies were made and 
distributed. 

A police source said: 'This man might have thought what he was doing was funny and it's not the first time he's posted videos of this kind'.

'But he'll be laughing on the other side of his face when we catch him and tell him he's facing a charge of dangerous driving,' they added.

With 781,000 followers, @policia recently overtook @FBIPressOffice as the most popular police account on Twitter. The FBI's account has 743,000 followers.

Spain's National Police is also the world's most retweeted government institution in the world, averaging 16,000 re-postings every week.

Last month Carlos Fernandez, who runs the official Spanish police account, was forced to admit an apology after its Twitter feed offered controversial advice on how to beat drug smuggling checks.

He said there had been an 'awkward failing' after the official account replied to a question about where drugs were best hidden by saying: 'Stash them where the sniffer dogs can't smell them.'
