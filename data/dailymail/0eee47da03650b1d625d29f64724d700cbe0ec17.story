A scientist has been given a €1million grant by the government to build the country's first plant for converting sewage in to energy.

Dr Dominik Peus has developed a process called Hydrothermal Carbonisation (HTC) which converts sewage, agricultural waste, food waste and slurry into carbon and water. 

The end product, dubbed biocoal, does not contain sulphur. It therefore burns more cleanly and qualifies 
for renewable energy subsidies.

Now the doctor's company Antaco has been awarded a grant of €1million by the Department of Energy and Climate Change
to build the country's first biowaste conversion plant.

A statement on the company's wesbite said: 'Over the past 5 years Antaco has developed a process that turns biowaste into a high value biofuel – biocoal. Antaco’s technology is unique with its ability to convert 100 per cent of organic matter into a high heat value biofuel – biocoal.

'In so doing, solves two major issues a) diverting waste from landfill and b) providing a carbon neutral fuel. The grant will enable Antaco to progress to the next stage of building and commissioning its first prototype plant which will be producing approximately 500 tonnes of biocoal by March 2014.'

Dr Peus added: 'It’s mad that we pay people to take away
 our waste, when it’s actually a valuable commodity. It’s 
like flushing coal down the toilet, or paying the bin men to take away 
our money.'

HTC involves cooking biomass at 200C and at an atmospheric pressure of 20bar.

It is essentially the same process that
 creates coal - except it takes hours rather than thousands of years.

Biocoal slurry can be dried into 
pellets and used as a direct replacement for fossil coal in existing power 
generating facilities, as well as in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and 
household boilers.

Use of the HTC method could cut the 
operating costs of any sewage plant by half, slash its energy use by 73 
per cent and reduce carbon emissions by 95 per cent, according to a 
study by the University of Zurich.

By using the HTC process related emissions could cut be reduced to a twentieth of their current level, says the study.

According to a recent 
lifecycle assessment by LCAworks in conjunction with Imperial College 
London, HTC is four times more efficient at dealing with sludge than 
anaerobic digestion.

Today’s
 stringent European and national directives mean that sewage sludge 
cannot be spread on farmland and is an expensive overhead.

Dr Peus 
displayed a sample product of biocoal made from orange peel discarded 
from a fruit processing plan at
 the Cleantech UK Trade and Investment event in London on Friday,

'They
 say it’ll cost €750m to refurbish one of Europe’s power stations. HTC 
creates a fuel that can be used in existing power plants, so it
 would save millions in energy infrastructure costs.'
