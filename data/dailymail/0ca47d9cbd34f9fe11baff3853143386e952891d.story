A psychiatric patient warned repeatedly that she would hurt someone shortly before stabbing a girl of 13 to death at random, a report revealed yesterday.

Hannah Bonser, 26, was ‘almost invisible’ and her predictions that she would attack someone fell on deaf ears.

In total 16 psychiatrists and 20 community workers were involved in her care over the years.

Hannah Bonser, who was jailed for a minimum of 22 years, was 'almost invisible' to some groups, despite being in and out of mental health care since 2002

They and mental health nurses ‘missed
opportunities’ to help Bonser and change her life for the better, said a
damning independent review of her treatment.

It highlighted bad decisions, inept 
leadership, inadequate information-sharing and an ‘overly-optimistic’ 
attitude by the professionals.

Bonser was jailed for a minimum of 22
years at Sheffield Crown Court in July after being convicted of 
murdering Casey Kearney, a total stranger.

The drug-addicted loner plunged a 
kitchen knife into the teenager’s chest without warning as she walked 
through a park in Doncaster on the way to a half-term sleepover with a 
friend.

Bonser, whose mental health problems 
were linked to years of cannabis abuse, had been involved with care 
agencies for 19 years because of a troubled upbringing.

As her mental state worsened in the 
weeks before the murder, she repeatedly warned she could be a danger. 
She told two charity workers who assessed her at home she had a ‘short 
fuse and anger issues’.

She warned that she was a danger to 
others and one day would ‘blow up’. However, the housing charity staff 
failed to share the information with mental health workers involved in 
her treatment and concluded there had been ‘no direct threats’ to 
herself or another person.

Bonser also told hospital staff she 
was ‘criminally insane’ and was going to harm herself or someone else. 
She said she needed to be locked up.

Three days later she told a 
psychiatrist that ‘seven people were trapped inside her body’ adding 
that ‘some of them were psychopathic, some looked down on people, some 
do not like children’.

Despite these warnings she was allowed to return to her flat and was visited by a ‘home treatment team’.

On January 16, less than a month 
before the Valentine’s Day murder, Bonser told a mental health nurse she
should not be around other people because she wanted to kill them. She 
said she had bad thoughts every day and therefore tried to stay away 
from people on the street.

Incredibly, the home treatment team 
‘discharged’ Bonser from its care two weeks later when there was 
evidence her condition had actually deteriorated.

The independent inquiry concluded 
that this showed she was not being ‘listened to’. It criticised the 
constant changing of psychiatrists and the failure of anyone to take the
lead in her care.

One consultant psychiatrist involved 
in the final  key period was accused of assessment and care planning 
‘significantly below acceptable standards’. There was ‘no robust care 
plan’ drawn up as her condition worsened alarmingly, said the report, 
which did not name any of the culprits.

Bonser was referred to as ‘Miss G’ in
the 146-page report written by Professor Pat Cantrill, a senior 
Department of Health official.

‘Everybody knew a little about Miss G, but nobody had the full picture,’ he said.

Professor Cantrill studied the 
actions of ten agencies and made 21 recommendations. Although he made it
clear that Bonser was responsible for Casey’s death, he concluded: ‘She
told many agencies of her concern that she was going to harm someone.

‘Assessments made by them did not identify a high level of risk of this occurring.’

Bonser told Professor Cantrill she 
felt people ‘did not listen or take her seriously’ and that she ‘asked 
to be locked up as she was afraid that she might hurt someone’. Bonser 
said ‘professional egos got in the way of providing the help she needed 
and she was always sent home’.

Christine Bain, chief executive of 
Rotherham Doncaster and South Humber NHS Foundation Trust, said action 
had been taken to implement the recommendations. ‘We acknowledge that 
our service to Miss Bonser should have been much better.’
