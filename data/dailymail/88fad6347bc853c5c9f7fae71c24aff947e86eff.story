A former NFL player who was forced into retirement after a series of concussions released a music video Thursday that serves not only as a touching tribute to his wife and three daughters, but as a reminder of his love for them in the event that he loses his own memory.

Ben Utecht, 33, wrote his new song 'You Will Always Be My Girls' while sitting in an airplane cruising at 30,000 feet. As wrote the lyrics, he had to pull the brim of his hat down to conceal the tears that were streaming off of his cheeks.

'Probably the most difficult thing I've ever had to do,' Utecht told CBS News.

According to Utecht, who was forced out of the NFL after he sustained a series of traumatic brain injuries over the course of his five year career, the song was written as a way to express his love for his wife Karyn and his three young daughters, in the event that the memory loss he suffers as a result of his injuries worsened to the point where he could no longer remember them.

'It was a chance for me to tell my girls that no matter what happens to 
me and my brain,' he told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, 'they’re always going to be there.'

Utecht, a tight end who had won the Super Bowl with the Indianapolis Colts in 2006, had always planned to be a professional singer after his retirement. His unceremonious exit from football came in 2009, when he sustained a concussion while practicing with the Cincinnati Bengals, the fifth brain injury he sustained in the NFL.

Utecht, who lost consciousness in the incident, was placed on the injured reserve after the injury, and effectively forced into retirement by November 2009. He was 29.

After the injury, Utecht experienced common side effects of brain injuries, such as amnesia, dizziness and sudden mood changes. According to him, when his oldest daughter told a family doctor that she was sometimes afraid of her Dad, it 'broke his heart' and he had 'a wake-up call.'

'To really think about a time where I may wake up someday and not 
recognize the person that I’ve been lying next to for the last 30 years,
 yeah, that’s scary,' he told the Star Tribune. 'I think every person would fear 
something like that.'

Utecht then began his work as an activist for increasing public awareness of issues related to brain injuries and concussions. Recently, he was named a national spokesperson for the American 
Academy of Neurology and the American Brain Foundation.

This week, Utecht participated in the White House Concussion Summit and shared his own story about the effects of brain injury with the 
Senate Committee on Aging in Washington, D.C..

'At 29, I started to have memory problems, and it took losing my mind to care about my mind,' he told the committee.

Utecht's activism through music and public appearances comes at a time when the NFL is dealing with a host of lawsuits filed by former players.

Notable players, such as former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon and former San Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau, have joined into a class action lawsuit which reached a tentative settlement this week after a previous agreement for $765 million was rejected by a federal judge.

Utecht is using his new music video to promote for the cause, including in the YouTube description of the video a link to the webiste for The American Brain Foundation.

In the same descrpition, Utecht wrote 'This video symbolizes the importance to fund research to find the cures for brain disease.'
