A father who bit into his McDonald's burger to find it was completely raw has vowed to never return to the chain.  

Byron Thomas, from Northampton,  ordered the quarter pounder with cheese meal for £4.69 on Monday evening, and took it back to his car. 

But when the 28-year-old eagerly tucked into his dinner, he noticed a strange taste after he had his first bite.

He said he was sickened when he saw that apart from the light brown top layer, the rest of the meal was red raw.

The father-of-two went back in to the branch at the Weston Favell Shopping Centre in Northampton to complain - but said the manager only offered to cook him another burger.

He then claims he was up from 4am on Tuesday being sick.

Mr Thomas, who lives with his partner Gail Mooney, 36, vowed never to eat there again.

He fumed: 'I was getting a bit of tea with my stepdaughter and I was in the car when I bit into it and thought it looked strange.

'Then I looked down and the outside was light brown but the rest of it inside was pure raw.

'I spat out what was in my mouth straight away, it was absolutely disgusting.

'I was up being sick at 4am the next morning and I am still being ill on and off now.

'I have Ulcerative Colitis so it doesn't help my stomach when I am eating completely raw meat.

'We only pop to McDonald's for a treat every now and then but there is no way me or any of my friends or family will ever be going there again.'

Byron, who works as a health and safety trainer on the railways, refused to give the raw burger back to the manager at the McDonald's branch.

He is now planning on contacting his local environmental health officer to make an official complaint.

Mr Thomas, who has two sons Kenzie, three, and Kyson, six, and two stepdaughters Katie, 13, and Karley, 16, has also contacted McDonalds' head office.

Mr Thomas claims he was up all night being sick after eating the burger. Mr Thomas, who lives with his partner Gail Mooney, 36, vowed never to eat at McDonald's again

He added: 'I went straight back in there but the manager didn't look too bothered.

'He just said 'sorry I'll cook you another burger'.

'But I refused to eat that and refused to give him the raw burger because he wanted to take it away.

'There were about 10 customers in the queue who just walked out when I showed them how disgusting it was.

'They couldn't give me a refund because they had already messed up my order three times and given me my money back for that. 

A McDonald's spokesman said: 'Food safety is our highest priority. We place great emphasis on quality control and follow rigorous standards in order to avoid any imperfections in our food. 

'We are disappointed to hear of this experience and as soon as we were made aware of the incident, we launched a full investigation. We will be in touch with Mr Thomas once this is complete.'

It is not the first time the fast-food chain has served less than savoury meals to customers.  

Sue Bennett, 43, of Rotherham, choked in disgust as she took the top of the bun off the burger to remove the gherkins - only to discover one of the meat patties was pink and uncooked so she took it to the manageress, who tested it with a temperature probe.

It gave a reading of 39 degrees C - nearly half the minimum temperature for cooking the burger. 

And Gizela Tahuri, a diner at a restaurant in Brisbane, Australia, was horrified to discover that her chicken McWrap was full of completely raw meat.
