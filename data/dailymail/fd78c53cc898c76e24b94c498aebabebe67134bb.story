Soaring through the air, a hungry white-tailed kite prepares to snatch a vole from his mother's claws.

The incredible mid-air takeaway was captured by Malaysian photographer Phoo Chan on a trip to Gomes Park in Fremont, California.

'At first glance this looks like a fight over food, but it is actually an adult white-tailed kite offering her freshly caught vole to her chick,' says 50-year-old Phoo, of California.

The photographer said this sort of behaviour is also known as a food-exchange ritual, which begins during the birds' nesting season

Being able to catch the vole in mid-air is part of the chick's formative training, before the bird is old enough to hunt on his own.

Phoo says: 'This behaviour is also known as a food-exchange ritual, which begins during the nesting season.

'A kite brings back its fresh catch and makes a mid-air offering to its chick, who then gladly flies in and grabs the vole.'

Capturing the images just twenty metres above him, Phoo watched from the ground as the white-tailed kite passed over the meadow vole to her youngster.

Phoo says: 'Witnessing a scene like this is an adrenalin rush beyond description.

'It's a rare moment being frozen in time, which is usually missed even when you watch the action yourself, because it happens in just a split second.

The white-tailed kite was rendered almost extinct in California in the 1930s and 1940s by shooting and egg-collecting. Although they are now considered to be common again, the distribution of the species is patchy

'You are unable to register the details and unique poses, which is why it's so great to capture moments like this on camera.

'Very often, people wonder how and where I took the picture, but it pleases me if I hear people say that they enjoy my pictures.

'I think it's important that we~re sensitive to nature and use common sense in understanding the ethics behind wildlife photography.

'Do not let your presence interfere with the subject in terms of keeping the right proximity and do not use any bait.'
