From haunting images of clouds rolling in over a bridge in America to a surfer battling for a wave with a leaping dolphin, photographers from around the world have submitted some of the most stunning panoramic images ever captured.

Nearly 900 photographers entered the Epson International Pano Awards, an annual competition that brings together the best wide-lens images of the past 12 months.

American Dennis Ramos was the overall winner with his picture of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St. Petersburg, Florida. 

'It was a beautiful cloudless day with some patches of rolling fog over the bridge. My friend and I decided to go fishing that mid afternoon. I found out that my reel wasn't working so I grabbed my camera gear instead,' he said.

'It took me a lot of time waiting and shooting in between the fog to get a good exposure. While waiting during long exposure times, I wished I had my fishing rod as well.'

Ben Neale, an Australian photographer, won the amateur competition in the nature and also the open nature category. He used a paraglider to capture a breathtaking image of a flock of brolga birds in Arnhem Land. The picture also won him the highest scoring aerial image.

'It was a tricky shot as I was out shooting landscapes that day and knew I would have to get very low to capture the brolgas in great detail, with a lot of sharp turns and some near misses it all came together in just 3 frames out of 200,' Mr Neale said.

Another Aussie photographer who made it in the finalist category was Matt Hutton. He named his shot 'Right Place Right Time' after capturing a magical moment between a dolphin and a surfer at Jacques Point in Western Australia.

The fifth Epson International Pano Awards received nearly 4000 entries from 870 photographers, each vying for the $40,000 top prize.
