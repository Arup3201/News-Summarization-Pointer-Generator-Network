'Horrified': Giving evidence at her assault trial, former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos described the publication of a sex tape as 'one of the worst times of my life'

Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos told her assault trial that the leaking of her sex tape was 'one of the worst times' in her life.

The singer claimed she had not known of the existence of the tape, which was made with an ex-boyfriend, and that celebrity blogger Savvas Morgan had been involved in it being leaked to the press.

The 25-year-old spoke out about the tape while giving evidence at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court, where she is standing trial accused of assaulting Mr Morgan at V Festival in Essex last August.

Writer Mr Morgan said he suffered swelling to the eye after the alleged incident involving the N-Dubz star at the Chelmsford festival site.

Contostavlos denies an assault charge, while her assistant Gareth Varey, who is also standing trial, denies threatening behaviour.

Giving evidence today, Contostavlos, wearing a black suit and black polo neck jumper, gave her occupation as 'singer and television personality'.

She also told the court that Mr Morgan had a 'strange obsession' with her, and that while at V Festival he had called her a 'whore and a nobody', and made reference to her mother's mental illness.

Asked by her barrister Jeremy Dein QC if she assaulted Mr Morgan, she said: 'Most definitely not.'

Mr Dein then asked Contostavlos about the sex tape, which had been made with an ex-boyfriend.

She said she found out Mr Morgan may have been involved in this.

She added: 'I couldn’t confirm at the time that he was involved because I didn’t know at the time the tape existed.

'Once I knew, a couple of details made me believe he was involved a lot more than he made out.'

Describing the publication of the sex tape, she went on: 'I was horrified - it was one of the worst times of my life.

'I recorded a video on YouTube explaining the situation and put it up online and posted it on my Twitter account.

'An
 ex-boyfriend had taken what was supposed to be private footage of us 
and many years later tried to sell it and put it online.'

She said she held no grudge against Mr Morgan: 'There were many people involved.

'I feel that some of the things he 
was doing were very mean, I didn’t like the man, but he was one of many 
people who had issues or dramas with me.

'It’s part of my life and I’m pretty used to it by now.'

Denial: Contostavlos said in her police interview that 'at no point' was she threatening or abusive towards Mr Morgan (right) at V Festival, and that she feared he may have been about to attack her

In a police statement read to the court earlier today, Contostavlos had said that Mr Morgan’s 'considerable ill-feeling and resentment' towards her stemmed 
from an incident at the Whisky Mist nightclub in Mayfair, London, when 
she asked security to request Mr Morgan to leave after he attempted to 
join her in a VIP area.

Describing
 the incident to the court, she said she had been filming for The X 
Factor with groups Little Mix and The Risk when Mr Morgan tried to join 
their table.

She said Chloe Green, star of Made in Chelsea and daughter of Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green, was with Mr Morgan.

'When I saw these people I had never 
seen before I alerted the security guard that we were filming and asked 
that they be removed from the table,' she added.

Matthew McNiff, prosecuting, quoted part of her autobiography, Honest, in 
which she describes how she suspected Ms Green had an affair with fellow
 N-Dubz member and former boyfriend Fazer.

She said: 'This came after the Whisky Mist incident.' 

Asked if she had come across such incidents before, she said: 'All the time.

'When
 something comes with the job, when you make that decision, it becomes 
part of your life and you just have to learn to get on with things and 
have a certain amount of control of the situation.

'At the time I didn’t actually know who he was until I was alerted by the tweets he was sending.'

Contostavlos told the court she had no criminal record.

She
 said that on another occasion, while working at the luxury Mondrian 
hotel in Los Angeles, she had been involved in an argument with Mr 
Morgan.

He claimed she was 
making too much noise and as she tried to leave the argument, he 
attempted to push his way through her bedroom door, Contostavlos said.

Contostavlos told the court that Mr Morgan had a 'strange obsession' with her, and said that he had 'followed' her around the globe.

'For the past two years he has been causing drama in my life as much as 
he can and has been following me to hotels across the world,' she said.

'It is something I have learned to deal with.'

Describing the alleged attack at V Festival, Contostavlos, said the incident was nothing more than a 'playground slanging match' which had been used as part of Mr Morgan's 'vendetta' against her.

'This is my life on the line, my livelihood,' she said.

'I cannot believe it has been taken to this point and I'm standing here today.'

Contostavlos said Mr Morgan had 
attempted to follow her back to her Winnebago at the festival after she 
had watched a performance by singer Beyonce when she asked him to stop.

'There was a point that I swore,' she added.

'At the start I was trying to be calm but this approach did not seem to work with him as he got more heated.'

The singer, who claimed she kept her 
hands behind her back during the confrontation, described how Mr Morgan 
called her 'a slag, a whore and a nobody' and made reference to her 
mother's mental illness.

Earlier the court had been told, via Contostavlos's police statement, that Mr
 Morgan had previously made 'unfounded and vicious' allegations against 
both her and Varey, following the Whisky Mist incident.

Referring
 to the alleged assault backstage at V Festival, Contostavlos added: 'At
 no point was I threatening or abusive towards him.'

She said she saw Mr Morgan being restrained and struggling and feared he may attack her.

Detective
 Sergeant Amanda White told the court stars who witnessed the incident, 
including singer and rapper Misha B, Mutya Buena of the Sugababes, 
singer Alexandra Burke and rapper Wretch 32, had all been asked to give 
police statements through their representatives, but none were provided.

In his statement, Varey said neither he nor Contostavlos had attacked Morgan.

'Neither
 of us would have done this as it was exactly the reaction he was 
looking for so he could make unfounded allegations against her and me,' 
he added.

Both of the defendants gave virtually identical accounts in pre-prepared statements to detectives.

They refused to answer further questions.

The pair said they knew Mr Morgan as he had sought to befriend them to obtain gossip for his blog.

Varey told the court that the Festival was the first time Contostavlos had appeared in public since a front page story following a newspaper investigation into another matter.

'The eyes of the world were on her and every photographer wanted a picture of Tulisa,' he added.

Describing the confrontation, he said Mr Morgan had raised his voice and been aggressive in an intimidating manner.

But he said neither he nor Contostavlos had attacked him and the first he knew about the claim was when he was contacted by journalists the following day.

'Vas (Mr Morgan) is doing it to get his name in the paper,' he added.

Varey said he had accepted a police caution for a previous incident in which he sent an email threatening to kill the personal assistant of Sun on Sunday investigative reporter, Mazher Mahmood, who is known as the Fake Sheikh.

Yesterday Mr Morgan told District Judge Angus Hamilton that during the V Festival incident, Contostavlos raised her fists in the air and was swinging her arms.

'Everyone was jumping around trying to get at me, there was a lot going on,' he said.

Prosecutor Matthew McNiff said the incident happened at 12.30am on August 18 as Mr Morgan was about to leave. He said Contostavlos accused Mr Morgan of stalking her, and swore at him.

A third person, Jacqueline Moore, 39,
 from Manchester, has admitted a public order offence in connection with
 the incident. She was fined £130 yesterday.

Contostavlos and Varey, 28, both of Friern Barnet, north London, are both on unconditional bail.

The trial will not sit on Wednesday or Thursday and is expected to conclude on Friday.
