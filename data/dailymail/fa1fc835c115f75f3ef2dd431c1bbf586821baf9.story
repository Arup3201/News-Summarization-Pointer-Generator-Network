The image of the dole queue, most famously captured in the hit film The Full Monty, is to be consigned to history with an overhaul of jobcentres.

Thousands of digital signing pads are being installed across the country to make it easier to claim out of work benefits.

Ministers claim the 'digital revolution' will help more people back into work, tearing up the paper booklets needed to sign on with every visit.

The jobcentre queue become an iconic moment in the Full Monty film, as the jobless steel workers-turned strippers practised their moves to the sound of Donna Summer's Hot Stuff

The scene in the 1997 film The Full Monty, when the six steel workers-turned strippers dance to Donna Summer's Hot Stuff, has been voted the funniest movie moment ever.

While waiting to sign on they find themselves practising their moves to the sound of the music playing in the jobcentre.

It became so famous that Prince Charles recreated it on a visit to Sheffield in 1998.

Now the government is tearing out the counters and installing more computers so jobseekers do not have to queue up.

Job cards, scanned by the unemployed in search of suitable vacancies, are also being binned.

Esther McVey MP, the Minister for Employment, said: 'Every day, Jobcentres across the country are helping people into work, contributing to record falls in unemployment.

'But as the economy grows and the jobs market changes, so are Jobcentres. Long gone are the Full Monty days of job cards in the windows and queuing for your dole.

'We're seeing record employment levels – and with this digital revolution, the government is doing even more to help people into work.'

Employment minister Esther McVey insisted the changes would make it easier for people to find work

The Department for Work and Pensions said new specially-designed computers will bring all jobcentre services into one device.

They are to be installed at more than 700 sites to make it easier for people to find work.

And 23,000 electronic signing pads will be fitted across the country, making it easier to sign on, and saving more than £1m a year.

It is claimed the move will cut fraud and make the jobseeking process paperless.

Free wi-fi will also be offered at all jobcentres, along with 6,000 digital jobsearch computers across Britain.

Officials say more than £2million every year will be saved as a result of the removal of the standalone jobpoints after more than two decades.

Last week official figures revealed biggest fall in unemployment since records began, as more than half a million people found a job in a year.

The number of people in work has reached a record 30.7 million, as the jobless total tumbled to its lowest level for eight years.

It was the first time the number of people unemployed has fallen below 2million since the autumn of 2008, in the wake of financial crash.

In September the number of people claiming Jobseekers Allowance also fell, down 18,600, to 951,900 - the 23rd consecutive monthly reduction.
