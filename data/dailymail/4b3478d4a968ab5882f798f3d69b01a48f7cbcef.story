Carlen Higgs, 33, allegedly burst into the Upper Darby police headquarters  before sitting on a bench and light up a doobie

A man police say was likely high on PCP on Sunday night when he burst into a Pennsylvania police station and lit up a joint.

Carlen Higgs, 33, allegedly burst into the Upper Darby police headquarters around 11pm 'ranting and raving' and 'demanding to see a police officer' before sitting on a bench and light up a doobie.

Apparently unsatisfied with the stir this caused in the precinct, Higgs would soon strip down in his holding cell, defecate on the floor and smear his feces across the cell walls.

He was 'pretty whacked out' Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told Philly.com. 

He was taken in for a mental health evaluation, at which point police say he was found to be under the influence of drugs, likely PCP.

Officers had to restrain Higgs as he was transported back to the station. 

Chitwood said Higgs has a nasty criminal record dating back to 2000.

Prior infractions include, according to Philly.com, terroristic threats, assault and possessing controlled substances.

For Sunday's incident, he's charged with disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, marijuana possession and possession of drug paraphernalia.

He's being held in lieu of $10,000 bail.
