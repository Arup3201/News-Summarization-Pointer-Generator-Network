Police in Florida stopped an oncoming train to rescue a dog that had been shot three times and tied to the railway tracks with a belt.

They discovered the dog had been shot twice in the neck and once in the shoulder after responding to three separate calls involving shots being fired on Wednesday afternoon.

Its injuries were so severe that the dog's front right leg needs to be amputated in the next few days.

The authorities are now asking for the public's help to find the thug who mercilessly left the animal for dead in the Sulphur Springs area.

It is under the care of Dr Davidson who says the dog - whose name could be Cabela - is sweet with a good temperament.
