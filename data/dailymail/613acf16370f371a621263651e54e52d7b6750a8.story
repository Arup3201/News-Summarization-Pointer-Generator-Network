A woman was left feeling ‘violated and butchered’ after routine surgery left her with virtually the same effects as female genital 
mutilation, a tribunal has heard in the first case of its kind.

Dr Sureshkumar Pandya performed a commonplace operation on the woman in 2012 - but last year, after she fell pregnant, a midwife who examined her said she had been mutilated.

Today Dr Pandya appeared before a tribunal where it was claimed he was acting beyond the 'limits of his competence' and removed parts of the woman's genitals which should have remained intact.

Accused: Dr Sureshkumar Pandya admitted performing a routine labiaplasty on the woman, but denied the GMC's claims that he was acting beyond his competence and the results were the equivalent of FGM

The woman approached the Regency Clinic in east London and Dr Pandya performed a labiaplasty operation on her in March 2012, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard.

Labiaplasty is the most common type of women's cosmetic genital surgery in Britain, and can be carried out on the NHS, with procedures rising fivefold in the last 10 years.

It is often used to treat serious medical conditions, but its popularity has also been criticised by experts who say it encourages unnecessary surgery and a trend towards 'designer vaginas'.

In November the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said it should no longer be carried out on the NHS.

Procedure: The woman said she felt like self- harming after the surgery by Dr Pandya (pictured)

Known only as Patient A, the woman was 'distressed and unhappy' by the results of her procedure and contacted doctors to 
raise her concerns, the fitness to practise panel heard.

Her own GP noted: ‘Patient was upset with the procedure, 
which was not as expected, unhappy with the surgeon and did not feel she
 was told the whole truth.

‘Tearful. Feels low and feels like harming herself.’

Sean Larkin QC, for the GMC, told the panel: ‘After the procedure a nurse told her she didn’t know why it had been done as it wasn’t needed.

‘She
 wondered if she had been circumcised. The patient had no idea what this
 meant.

‘It is quite 
clear [from medical notes] that the impact of this 
procedure was devastating on Patient A and caused her extreme anguish, 
such that there were concerns about the state of her mental health as a 
result of the procedure.

‘Coincidentally
 it seems on this same day another doctor referred the case to the GMC.

'Her referral is made on the basis that Patient A had reported being 
railroaded into the procedure and feeling violated and butchered 
afterwards.’

The woman 
underwent a number of examinations in 2012, none of 
which concluded that she had undergone FGM, also known as female circumcision.

It was not until last year, after she fell pregnant, that a 
midwife said the result of the procedure had been virtually the equivalent of being circumcised.

An expert report said the ‘anatomical result was virtually indistinguishable from FGM type I-II.’

Mr Larkin told the panel aspects of the procedure could be covered by criminal legislation.

He
 said they ‘would be covered by the definition of the FGM Act 2003 and 
by the definition according to the World Health Organisation.

'That shows the extent to which there were these injuries.’

Intentionally performing FGM has been a criminal offence since 1985, and in 2003 the maximum sentence was increased from five to 14 years in jail.

Procedure: The common operation took place at the Regency Clinic in east London in March 2012

The panel was 
told Dr Pandya occasionally performed operations at the Regency Clinic, 
but despite his significant surgical experience, had not 
practised gynaecology since 1994.

He denied this, saying he performed the operation but that many of the other claims about his work were untrue.

Patient A will not be called to give evidence to the fitness to practise panel, with it instead relying on expert witnesses and medical notes.

It comes as a minister said victims in criminal FGM cases - in other words, where FGM has been performed intentionally - could be given anonymity in court, to combat the fear and shame of coming forward.

Justice Minister Damian Green (pictured) told the Evening Standard today: 'The Government is committed to tackling and preventing the abhorrent practice of female genital mutilation.

'We are considering suggestions for strengthening the criminal law on FGM and we'll be looking at whether present arrangements for protecting witnesses' identities are adequate.'

Dr Pandya is not accused of a criminal offence and it is not thought he has been questioned by police.

Dr Pandya has already admitted performing an operation on the woman, known as Patient A.

He also admitted not noting down his discussions with her about the surgery, particularly its risks.

But he denied the other three allegations against him at the tribunal, which were brought by the General Medical Council.

They were that he removed and damaged certain parts of the woman's genitals; that the result was the equivalent of FGM; and that he had not practised in gynaecology since 1994.

This morning, the hearing in Manchester was warned there is a stark difference 
between a botched operation that technically fell within the definition 
of FGM, and a doctor deliberately conducting the procedure in what would be a criminal offence.

The panel, chaired
 by Dr Anthony Morgan, was told they can only find the allegation proved
 if the doctor fully intended to perform FGM.

The
 hearing was told that there are thought to have been two other 
regulatory cases of doctors, and one of a dentist, involving FGM, but all three related to undercover journalists making inquiries about 
the procedure.

‘This is the first time that this 
matter has properly been assessed and it is important for any case that 
may follow to set out the ambit of female genital mutilation,’ Mr Larkin
 added.

Dr Pandya is currently subject to an interim conditional GMC order, originally imposed in July last year, which restricts the work he is allowed to carry out.

The string of conditions keeps him closely monitored and bans him from carrying out female genital operations.

The hearing continues.

Banned: It is illegal to intentionally carry out FGM

To intentionally carry out FGM has been illegal since 1985, but Britain's first criminal charges were not brought until last month.

Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, 31, from Ilford, east London, was working at the Whittington Hospital in north London when he was accused of carrying out the procedure.

Hasan Mohamed, 40, from Holloway, north London, is accused of encouraging and helping him, prosecutors said. Both will appear before Westminster magistrates later this month.

The prosecutions follow a lengthy campaign by human rights groups to raise awareness of the procedure's existence.

It is thought as many as 66,000 women in the UK have suffered FGM with 24,000 girls under 11 also at risk.

The tradition originated in ethnic groups spread throughout 28 African countries, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan, and spread across the world as groups emigrated.

The circumcision or 'cutting' is often carried out for cultural reasons, sometimes because it shows a girl's virginity on her wedding night.

FGM is defined as any partial or full removal of a woman's outer sexual organs. It can also involve sewing up the vagina.
