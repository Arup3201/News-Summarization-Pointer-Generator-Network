Blind and alone in Alaska winter temperatures that dipped 40 degrees below zero, Abby a lost 8-year-old Fairbanks rescue dog wasn't given much of a chance to make it home.

But after walking 10 miles to the edge of a local musher's dog yard, Abby the brown-and-white mixed breed was found and returned to her owners, a family that includes three boys under the age of 10 - with the help of Facebook.

The dog that the family raised from an animal-shelter puppy went missing during a snowstorm on December 13th, and the family never expected to see her again.

Home sweet home: Abby is now home and safe again after spending more than a week lost in the Alaskan snowstorm

The local community mobilized, sharing the dog’s story and 
description through emails and Facebook posts.

'It's a miracle, there's no other words to describe it,' said McKenzie Grapengeter, emotion choking her voice and tears coming to her eyes. 'We never expected to have her to be returned safe and alive.'

Musher and veterinarian Mark May said he came across the dog while running his team on December 19th, but didn't stop to pick her up.

He told The Fairbanks Daily News Miner: 'It ran with us for about a mile on the way home before she fell off the pace, but I had a big dog team so I couldn't grab it,' he said. 'I said, "boy I hope it finds somebody's house."'

The next day, the dog turned up at May's house.

'Everybody just assumed it was some kind of scaredy-cat, but there it was in front of the door in our dog lot and it was blind,' May said. 'It was sitting there, all the way from 14 mile on the winter trail down into this neighborhood, I guess by just sniffing, so I picked it up and brought it in.'

To May's surprise, the dog had no signs of frostbite.

Found: Abby walked 10 miles before she was found and returned to her owners

Other than being hungry and cold, May said he was amazed that she didn’t have any signs of frostbite from the week in the cold.

'No frozen ears, no frozen toes, she'll probably go back home and it'll (be) business as usual. She's no worse for wear but quite an adventure,' he said.

The Grapengeter family hadn't tagged or put a microchip in the dog, but the community used social media to track down Abby's owners.

'We're so, so grateful for all (the community's) hard work,' McKenzie Grapengeter said. 'They've given us the most amazing Christmas gift we could ever ask for.'
