Ally McCoist has received assurances about his immediate future from the Rangers hierarchy in the wake of Mike Ashley’s power play.

Rumours McCoist could be facing the sack swept Glasgow on the day the new regime began to take shape - with Ashley's former managing director at Newcastle United, Derek Llambias, arriving in the city on Monday night ahead of talks with the Ibrox board.

However, PLC chairman David Somers and football board chairman Sandy Easdale both spoke with McCoist to tell him to concentrate on a hectic schedule of fixtures.

Despite those words of comfort, speculation is likely to persist about his longer-term prospects. McCoist has lost an ally in former chief executive Graham Wallace, whose inevitable departure after opposing Ashley was confirmed yesterday morning.

Other influential elements of the Rangers powerbase are believed to have a less favourable view of McCoist but he was given backing ahead of Tuesday's League Cup quarter-final against St Johnstone.

‘I received a couple of phone calls from the chairman and Sandy Easdale this morning, which was great,’ said McCoist.

‘The chairman was great. We had a 15 to 20 minute conversation – the majority of which will remain private – but he was kind enough to explain the board’s views and opinions on taking the Mike Ashley offer.

‘The two gentlemen didn’t need to phone but took the time to do so.

‘Sandy phoned basically to say much the same and to tell me to concentrate my thoughts totally on tomorrow’s game and indeed the upcoming fixtures.'

Asked if he had any fears he could be facing the axe when those calls arrived, McCoist said: ‘No. And I don’t say that meaning to be blasé. Every manager knows how precarious the job is.

‘I genuinely thought two board members were phoning to give me an update on what has been happening.’

Easdale, who arrived at Ibrox on Monday to oversee a restructuring programme, added: ‘We have not got any ideas of changing the manager That’s not on the agenda.’

Fears had been expressed over Rangers’ ability to meet next month’s wages without any new finance and McCoist welcomed the £2 million loan from Newcastle United owner Ashley.

‘The news of Mike’s involvement is good news,’ he said. ‘I’ve said all along the club needs investment, so we’ve got it.’

Llambias is a close ally of Ashley and is expected to replace Wallace as chief executive, although he could initially be employed as a consultant.

He was reluctant to answer questions at Glasgow Airport, but did laud the credentials of the Sports Direct billionaire, saying: '“Mike Ashley has got a great track record'.

Meanwhile, Ashley's weekend move - which enables him to appoint two directors -has drawn the attention of the SFA.

The governing body are writing to both Ashley and Rangers seeking clarification on the loan deal and how it may impact on the agreement signed back in 2012.

That limited Ashley to a stake of no more than 10 per cent — he currently has 8.9 per cent — and imposed certain restrictions on his influence.

The SFA will await responses before deciding if there has been any possible breach.
