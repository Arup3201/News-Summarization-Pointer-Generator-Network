Dyson has begun a legal battle with Samsung, claiming that the electronics giant ‘ripped off’ one of its inventions.

Sir James Dyson, founder of the British vacuum cleaner maker, said the South Korean company’s new MotionSync range ‘directly copied’ the steering mechanics of Dyson’s DC37 and DC39 models.

Dyson said it patented the central ball system – which allows a vacuum to move more easily around corners, table legs and over carpets – in 2009, and spent three years developing the design.

Sir James said: ‘This looks like a 
cynical rip off. Although they are copying Dyson’s patented technology, 
their machine is not the same.

‘Samsung
has many patent lawyers so I find it hard not to believe that this is a
deliberate or utterly reckless infringement of our patent.

'We
have been forced to issue proceedings in the English High Court, but I 
would much rather invest in research to develop new technology than have
to sue.'

Dyson has not said whether it 
wishes to block the sale of Samsung’s product or impose a licence fee.

Samsung said the claims were ‘groundless’ and would take all necessary measures ‘to protect our technological innovation’.

Dyson
said it spent three years researching and developing the design of the 
DC37 and DC39, which pivot on a central ball rather than wheels.

The company said it believes the Samsung Motion Sync vacuum cleaner infringes its patent for an invention entitled 'A cleaning appliance with a steering mechanism.'

Samsung said: 'The Samsung Motion Sync is an outcome of our own extensive research and development.

'We
will take all necessary measures, including legal action, to protect 
our technological innovation against Dyson's groundless claims.'

It is far from the first time that Samsung has been accused of copying another company's technology.

Last year they were ordered to pay Apple $1.05 billion for infringing patents relating to smartphones and tablets.

In
2009 a British judge ordered Samsung to pay Dyson about £600,000 after 
it tried to patent the UK firm’s ‘triple-cyclone’ suction technology.
