Cruel: Paul McCaw tried to smother his pet dog Cheech before stabbing her 40 times

A dog owner has been jailed for stabbing his Staffordshire Bull Terrier to death, while his children slept upstairs.

The family pet Cheech was left with at least 40 different wounds after Paul McCaw, 27, attacked her with a six-inch kitchen knife and then buried her in the back garden.

McCaw claimed the animal had been suffering excruciating pain in its back legs caused by a car accident eight years ago and he wanted to put her out of her misery and could afford to take her to the vets. 

When the animal was missed by his children the following day, McCaw told them she had gone to 'doggy heaven'.

When RSPCA inspectors turned up at his home after neighbours raised concerns, the father-of-three claimed he strangled the dog the previous day.

But Cheech had actually suffered a 'terrible and violent death'.

Peter Mitchell, prosecuting, told St Helens Magistrates' Court: 'He said that the dog collapsed in pain, so he took it into the back garden and he strangled it, taking about 20 minutes.'

McCaw, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, allowed inspectors to dig up the body but lied and told them it was buried in a field next to a cemetery.

When the RSPCA inspectors demanded to look in his back garden, he 'refused them access and became hostile'.

They left and later returned with a police officer where they were able to dig for Cheech under a patch of recently disturbed soil.

The ten-year-old dog was covered in multiple stab wounds and soaked in blood.

Mr Mitchell said that one of the wounds looked as if McCaw had attempted to 'slash its wrist'.

She also had wounds to its head, chest and neck.

Blood was also found on table legs inside the house, on a children's toy box and dried blood on the remaining edge of a piece of lino that had been cut away.

 'This dog suffered an absolutely terrible,
violent death at the hands of an owner who had been responsible for her
for almost her entire life'

In total Cheech suffered 40 wounds - with one puncturing a lung - causing her to collapse. Mr Mitchell said the dog died drowning in its own blood.

Under police interview, McCaw said Cheech had been struggling with her legs for the past ten months.

Mr Mitchell described how McCaw lay beside his dog and tried to slit her throat, before plunging the kitchen knife into her chest.

His defending solicitor Mark Brown said McCaw had previously sought veterinary help for Cheech.

On the night she was killed, Cheech jumped off the settee and appeared to be in pain. McCaw had given her half a paracetamol tablet in the past, but on this night, the dog snapped and bit him, said Mr Brown.

He added: 'In his own mind (McGraw), was of the view that Cheech was suffering and needed to be put out of its misery. No vet is going to turn away a dog that needs to be treated, which is what he should have done.'

The court was told McCaw tried to smother Cheech, but when that did not work he stabbed her.

Mr Brown said: 'The next morning, the children came down, but couldn’t find the dog. He told them it had died and had gone to doggy heaven.

'He didn’t even tell his partner and that appeared to be that. Then two days later the inspectors came knocking.'

He was jailed for 18 weeks on Monday, having pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the dog at a previous hearing.

He was also banned from keeping animals for 20 years.

RSPCA inspector Louise Showering said: 'This dog suffered an absolutely terrible, violent death at the hands of an owner who had been responsible for her for almost her entire life.

'Though he says he thought he was putting her out of her misery, he actually caused her to suffer much more with the actions he took. First trying to suffocate her then stabbing her many, many times.

'I can’t imagine what this dog’s final hours must have been like at the hands of someone she loved.

'It certainly wasn’t the dignified and pain-free end most owners hope for their beloved pets.'
