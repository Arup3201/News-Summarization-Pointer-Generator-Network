A sprawling military bunker containing a treasure trove of vehicles and weaponry spanning more than two world wars has been discovered at a secret location deep within a French forest.

Like a giant time capsule, the huge installation, carved out of solid rock, is said to contain wartime relics from a German 77mm 
Model-1896 World War One cannon to military vehicles dating from the 1960s and 1970s.

It was discovered by a team which normally specialises in exploring urban areas. Although they will not reveal the exact location, it is believed the bunker once formed part of the Maginot line - the array of fortifications and defences constructed along France's borders with Italy and Germany after World War One.

Mystery: The vehicles are in extremely good condition with fully inflated tyres and a noticeable lack of rust, prompting some experts to suggest they are part of a private collection which has been moved there recently

Some of the vehicles, including a Cold War-era ERC-90 armed recon vehicle and a World War Two era truck are remarkably well-preserved, with fully inflated tyres and a noticeable lack of rust, prompting some experts to suggest they are part of a private collection that has been moved there recently.

However the explorers believe the facility was abandoned in the late 1980s or early 1990s at the end of the Cold War and point to the rusted remains of the German heavy guns as proof that it was in use almost a century ago.

The installation also houses office spaces and barracks. According to Gizmodo, the bunker has more recently been used by locals for the cultivation of mushrooms.
