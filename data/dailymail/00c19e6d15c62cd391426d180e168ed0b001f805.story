You could be the new owner of a £1m hotel for just £1,000, if you're prepared to take a bit of a gamble.

A hotelier couple are giving away their 14-bedroom Essex resort in a prize draw after running the business for 18 years.

Owners Gordon and Blossom Hoyles and the Hotel Continental, in Dovercourt, appeared on Channel 4 show Four In A Bed in 2012, raising eyebrows at the time for their taste in erotic art.

Yours for a grand: The owners of Hotel Continental in Dovercourt, Essex, are giving away the hotel in a prize draw - tickets cost £1,000

While terms and conditions are still being ironed out, it will cost £1,000 for a ticket to be entered into the prize draw.

The decision to sell the property in such an unusual way came in an early morning burst of inspiration after the couple were told that it would take two years to sell the property in the current market. 

'One morning I woke up at 3.30am, went to the bar and said to our night porter I would raffle the hotel,' 78-year-old Mr Hoyles said.

'I started to look into it and found we could do it as a prize draw. We got a solicitor and started putting it together.

'Blossom and I think it's time for a change. I haven't got that much time to spare and I don't want to be arguing over conveyancing trifles at 80 plus.

'Going might be a bit traumatic - a bit painful, but having decided to go we want to go quickly.

'It seems a good thing to give the winner an instant, exciting, life-changing, lucky day.'

Gordon and Blossom showed off the Hotel Continental on Four In A Bed two years ago.

The show sees hoteliers spend a night in a rival B&Bs, paying how much they believe the room is worth.

Every room is described k as 'unique and deliberately different', with prices starting at £35 a night.

The Dry Dock room looks like a ship's cabin with a stained glass porthole design window.

Room eight is described as: 'A bit refined, a bit masculine. Sturdy oak.' 

There is also a family room with a double bed and bunk beds. Some rooms are decorated with racy wallpaper, unusual artwork and bespoke furniture.

The hotel, which overlooks Dovercourt Bay, has a bar, 24-cover restaurant and terrace garden.

The Hoyles hope the tickets could start being sold within a month.

It is still being discussed whether there will need to be a minimum number of tickets sold for the sale to go ahead.

However, it cannot be called a lottery or a raffle as a lottery cannot be held for private financial gain and raffles have a prize limit so both would be illegal.

Gordon and Blossom hope to visit Mr Hoyles' daughter in Australia, take a well-earned holiday and possibly move to France.

Mr Hoyles said: 'We work 15 to 18 hour days so it would be nice to retire or have another business that isn't quite so hectic.' 

Budget: Accommodation ranges from large family suites to basic singles
