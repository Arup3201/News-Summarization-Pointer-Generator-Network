Two married councillors have refused calls to stand down - despite moving to a village 150 miles away.

Conservatives Alan and Jean Willicombe, from Sittingbourne, Kent, retired to the Lincolnshire village of Gedney Drove End earlier this month.

But the pair have sparked outrage by saying they will keep their seats on Swale Borough Council - and commute to meetings at the taxpayer's expense.

The former mayor and mayoress, who have each served for more than 10 years, will continue to claim allowances of at least £4,737 each.

They will also pocket travel expenses of between £130 and £175 every time they drive to a meeting.

This is despite their new phone number not appearing on Swale Borough Council's website. Instead residents are given phone numbers for two colleagues who still live in Sittingbourne.

'Murky, dirty and puerile': How one resident described the decision by councillors Alan and Jean Willicombe, pictured, to keep their seats on Swale Borough Council, Kent, despite starting a new life 150 miles away

'Disgraceful': The 300-mile round trip the pair must take for every meeting, costing taxpayers up to £175

Mr Willicombe said it was pointless to force the council to pay for a by-election because the Woodstock ward, which the couple represent, will disappear in 2015 under boundary changes.

He added: 'I wasn’t going to stand again in 2015 because my ward was being dismantled and it’s the same for Jean.

'I don’t think there is a point to standing down - I can still work and be in contact with the other councillors.

'Why have the cost of another election? It seems a bit stupid.'

But furious resident John Greenhill, 64, said the councillors’ relocation was 'murky, dirty and puerile'.

He said: 'They didn’t have the decency to inform their constituents they were going.

'I think it’s a disgraceful situation - how can they honestly say they represent the people of this ward?

'It’s a despicable political tactic so they don’t have to resign for fear of the Tories losing their stranglehold of this borough and can’t be replaced by Labour or UKIP councillors.

'They were hardly seen about the ward when they were here. If they were honourable, they would resign.'

The pair are a former mayor and mayoress of Swale and Mr Willicombe previously served as a Kent county councillor.

Mr Willicombe said: 'We
put our property up for sale just to see what the market was like and 
we sold it in two days, which was far quicker than we ever expected.

'We thought it would take six months to a year - so it pushed us into looking for somewhere far quicker than we wanted to.

'It’s
just the way things panned out. I have got a sister up here and 
properties are cheaper - it’s as simple as that, and it will be nice to 
retire to.'

The home in Gedney Drove End, Lincolnshire, where the pair moved earlier this month. A round trip to council meetings in Sittingbourne, Kent, will cost taxpayers between £130 and £175 depending on what car they drive

Mrs Willicombe was Mayoress of Swale in 2008-09. Her husband said: 'Why have the cost of another election? It seems a bit stupid'

The couple can claim 42.9p a mile for travel if they drive a car whose engine is smaller than 1,000cc.

But they can claim 58.7p a mile - 13.7p more than the government recommends for private firms - if it is larger than 1,200cc, which accounts for most family cars.

Kent county councillor for UKIP Mike Baldock said: 'I know they haven’t been to Tunstall Parish Council since May - there was a big meeting about the school and they were not there.

'If it was my party, I would expect them to stand down. If they were still able to regularly attend meetings and give a good service, that’s OK.'

The Conservative group leader on Swale Borough Council, Cllr Andrew
Bowles, said: 'It’s unfortunate, but without knowing the full facts, 
it’s difficult to comment.

'It’s difficult to ask people to stand for election somewhere that’s going to disappear.

'The people who are technically represented by Alan and Jean won’t be in future - it’s an unusual situation.'

Robert Oxley, campaign director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Councillors living on the other side of the country cannot claim to be credible representatives of the local community.

'Claiming travel expenses for a 300-mile round trip is clearly an unreasonable use of taxpayers' money. The pair should stand down rather than attempting to be absentee politicians at greater expense.'

If the couple fail to attend meetings for six months they can be automatically disqualified from being a councillor.
