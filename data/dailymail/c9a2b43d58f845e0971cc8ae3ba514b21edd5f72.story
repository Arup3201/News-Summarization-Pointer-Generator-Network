She is the ultimate natural beauty famed for her glowing skin and flawless complexion.

And now, songstress Kimberley Walsh has revealed the secrets behind her radiant fresh-faced glow as she poses for a set of stunning never-seen-before photographs.

Unlike most celebrities the 31-year-old has spoken out to tell women that they don’t need invasive treatments or an entourage of make-up artists to look flawless every day.

Natural beauty: Famed for her glowing complexion, the Girls Aloud star reveals her beauty secret to MailOnline

Because despite having enough money to splurge on luxury goods and top-class make-up artists, Kimberley, who is famously very down-to-earth, admits she favours the basics.

Speaking to MailOnline about her beauty secrets, she said: 'Covering over 
the cracks with make-up and fake tan doesn’t always make us look or feel
 better – I always feel more confident and beautiful by doing the body 
basics before I step out.

'The
 best beauty trick I have – and it’s not even a secret – is to stress 
how important the basics are.

'Applying makeup around tired eyes, over 
skin that has not been prepped and wearing beautiful shoes on unloved 
feet will never make you feel good. 

Back to basics: Despite having enough money to splurge on luxury goods and top-class make-up artists, Kimberley favours the basics like E45 cream

'It's the small things that have to 
be done first, such as moisturising from top to toe, that make all the 
difference.

'For me, making sure my skin is smooth and hair free, by 
using products like E45 lotion, and regularly washing and cleansing my 
face all make me feel confident in my skin.

'Whether I’m 
make-up free or prepping for a shoot, I need the confidence that my skin
 will be blemish free. Clearasil Daily Clear Vitamins & Extracts 
Wash and Mask is great for everyday use – it smells nice, feels great on
 my skin and is really pleasant to use.

'By doing the everyday beauty
 basics every woman can feel great about themselves.'

With some of the busiest tootsies in 
showbiz, Kimberley explained that taking good care of her feet is also essential: 'With all the dancing I do I need to pay even
 more attention to my feet as they often take a battering! In fact, 
Strictly Come Dancing did more damage to my feet than climbing Mount 
Kilimanjaro!

'Now I rely on products like Scholl Express Pedi to help me 
get my feet back to being touchable soft and smooth.

'With my job I’m 
lucky that I get to wear beautiful shoes but it means my feet need to 
look good too – a regular foot care routine is important for me as it’s 
easy to forget about your feet, especially when they’re hidden away.'

Get her glow: She explains she gets plenty of sleep, exercises regularly and has a good diet to maintain her glow

Revealing how she maintains her famed glow through her diet and lifestyle, despite having a seriously hectic work schedule, the star revealed: 'Glowing is straightforward. For me this starts by ensuring I get plenty of 
sleep, exercise regularly and have a good diet.

'Taking care of yourself 
is easy when you respect these three things.'

She goes on to explain how she has been keeping in shape now that she's not dancing around on stage on Strictly Come Dancing.

'I
 see my trainer 3 times a week and she works me really hard. I've never 
been one to deny myself any foods - I train so I can eat what I want!,' she said.

She may not be a size zero, but Kimberley definitely makes the most of her curvy assets and womanly figure and always looks great in figure-hugging dresses.

'You
 have to work with what you've got and accentuate the best bits.

'I think
 it's not always about keeping up with the new fashion trends as they 
more often than not, don't suit all shapes, but rather finding a way of 
making the new trends work for you,' she added.

Kimberley's latest job sees her smouldering for the Ready to Glow campaign.

A recent study by Ready to Glow found
 that the average woman will spend more than £13,000 during her lifetime
 on looking and feeling good.

Researchers found the 'cost of 
confidence' carries a hefty price tag, as women fork out £205.68 a year -
 or £13,369.20 in their lifetime - on beauty products in order to feel 
better about themselves.

Around 86 per cent of women claim their confidence is greatly improved if they are well groomed from top to toe.

And six in ten women have a strict beauty regime in place to ensure they leave the house feeling assured about their appearance.

But the study also found that despite
 the costly outlay, women only feel good about themselves for three 
hours and 43 minutes a day.

Speaking about her role, which aims to empower women to look and feel great by carrying out everyday beauty basics to achieve that radiant ‘glow', she said: 'I am proud to be part of Ready to Glow, like many woman I’ve had my own body hang-ups in the past but I’m passionate about helping or supporting other women to feel confident in their own skin and celebrating natural beauty.'

But the talented star always has her eyes firmly set on the future.

Speaking about her big plans, she said: 'I'm someone that loves to keep busy, and always love to have things in my diary!

'At the moment I'm busy working on my book which is due for release in the autumn.

'There are lot's of exciting things being discussed although as yet I'm not allowed to share them with you....Will tell all, as soon as I can!'
