Wednesday: Steve Powell arrives in court on the day of opening arguments in his voyeurism trial today

A judge barred 'sexually graphic and obsessive' diary entries belonging to the father-in-law of missing Utah mother Susan Powell from being used at his trial, ruling they were irrelevant and would likely make jurors biased.

It was the second victory in as many days for Steven Powell, accused of 14 counts of voyeurism, after the same judge ruled on Monday that a pornography charge against him should be dropped because the 2,000 images of his neighbor's children taking a bath did not prove he influenced the conduct of the subject of the pictures.

Yesterday, Judge Ronald E. Culpepper said eight journal entries, in which Steven Powell discussed his obsession with his daughter-in-law Susan and sexual fantasies, were not admissible.

'This is all about stalking Susan,' Judge Culpepper said of one entry
Powell wrote about taking photos of his daughter-in-law in the driveway.

Samples from the entries included phrases like: 'Susan likes to be admired and I'm a voyeur', 'I'm a voyeur and Susan is an exhibitionist' and 'I've been going nuts and nearly out of control sexually my entire life,'

He did allow one entry to be used where Powell wrote: 'I enjoy taking video shots of pretty girls in shorts and skirts. I sometimes use these images for self stimulation.'

Steven Craig Powell faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each of 14 counts against him. If convicted of all counts, he could face up to 70 years in prison.

A jury of 12 men and women and two alternates were finally selected out of 70, who had to answer questions about whether or not they were biased or had formed an opinion on the high-profile case.

Center of the debate: Steve Powell kept pictures of Susan breastfeeding and changing and diary entries detailing he watched her often

Defense attorney Travis Currie argued yesterday the excerpts should not be used because it takes away from the voyeurism aspects of the trial and puts the focus on Susan Powell and her husband Josh, who killed himself and the couple's two sons in a 
fiery explosion in February at a house in Graham.

Many believed the murder suicide was an admission of guilt in his wife's disappearance but Chuck and Judy Cox have always maintained that Steven Powell had something to do with their daughter's disappearance.

Josh Powell was the only named person of interest in the case but was never charged or arrested.

He claimed he took his young sons, then four and two, camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am. When he came home, Susan was gone and he said she  had run off with another man.

Authorities searched the desert for twelve days in the area where Josh Powell said he went camping that night. At one point, they said they found a 'shallow grave' after cadaver dogs alerted them to the spot. But they found no human remains.

Concerned: Susan's parents, Judy and Chuck Cox, hope that Steven Powell 'slips' and reveals something about the 2009 disappearance of their daughter

Defense attorneys argued that even the mention of Susan Powell's name would prejudice a jury as it has been such a high-profile case, culminating in the murder of her sons earlier this year.

It also emerged that a recording of 
Powell sexually gratifying himself while looking at pictures of Susan 
was discovered along with thousands of pictures that focused on her 
behind and taken while she was breastfeeding.

Pierce
County prosecutors agreed about the risk of prejudice, but said the 
passages were crucial to prove that Steve Powell recorded the images, 
and that he did it for his sexual gratification.

Other categories of digital files 
included close-ups of women putting groceries in their cars and others 
titled, 'DMV girl', 'Tacoma Mall', 'gum-chewing cutie', and 'young teen 
volleyball player'.

Opening statements in the trial are likely to begin on Wednesday, assuming a jury is selected by then.

Susan Powell's parents Chuck and Judy 
Cox watched anxiously as Powell was led into the courtroom yesterday 
wearing handcuffs, a tie and gray suit.

While more than 60 potential jurors 
filled out questionnaires in another room, prosecutors and defense 
attorneys discussed how much should be disclosed at the trial about 
Steve Powell's apparent obsession with his son's wife.

If convicted of the remaining 14 
charges, he would face a guideline sentence of about four years but the 
state has alleged aggravating circumstances that could result in a 
longer term.

The thousands of images found by 
investigators reportedly show a decade’s worth of his work, but in this 
specific case they are expected to focus on the ones relating to the 
years 2006 and 2007.

They volunteered to redact her name, and the judge and defense counsel agreed with the suggestion.

Susan Powell's disappearance took a 
bizarre turn last summer as authorities from Washington and Utah stepped
up their efforts to solve the case. Steve Powell claimed on TV that he 
and Susan Powell had a sexually charged relationship, something her 
parents denied.

Steve Powell's arrest prompted the state to take custody of Josh Powell's sons, who were living with their father at Steve Powell's home.

The boys were turned over to Susan Powell's parents, prompting a custody fight that ended Feb. 5, when Josh Powell locked a social worker out of his home during what was supposed to be a supervised visit with his sons.

He attacked Charlie and Braden, 7 and 5, with a hatchet, then started a fire that killed all three as the social worker called 911.
