Authorities say a seventh suspect in the kidnapping of a North Carolina prosecutor's father has been arrested in Atlanta.

Quantavious Thompson is the seventh person to be arrested in what the FBI has called an 'elaborate plot' to kill the father of Assistant District Attorney Colleen Janssen

FBI spokeswoman Shelley Lynch said in a statement that Quantavious Thompson was taken into custody late Wednesday afternoon.

Details on his arrest weren't immediately available Thursday.

Frank Janssen was kidnapped April 5 from his home and driven in a rented hatchback to Atlanta, where he was held for five days before his rescue.

Thompson is the seventh person to be captured in what the FBI has called an 'elaborate plot' to kill Janssen as his daughter, Assistant District Attorney Colleen Janssen put a gang member away for life, Fox News reports.

The last subject remaining at-large is Jakym 'Jak' Camel Tibbs, known simply by his last name.

The 20-year-old New Yorker is considered armed and dangerous.

A $25,000 reward has been offered for information that leads to his arrest.

Janssen was taken from his Wake Forest N.C. home and restrained, then eventually rescued Wednesday in an FBI raid on an Atlanta apartment complex.

Tibbs and Thompson allegedly used a stun gun on Janssen when he answered his door, then took him to Atlanta.

Once there they texted his wife pictures of Janssen tied to a chair with messages they would cut him if she did not cooperate.

Federal agents claim Kevin Melton, 49, 
was the mastermind behind the scheme, coordinating with text messages 
from his prison cell.

Suspect Jakym Tibbs remains on the run

Melton is serving a prison term on a 2012 conviction for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury.

These latest crimes will add a charge of conspiracy to kidnap.

Police allege the high-ranking Bloods member sent more than 120 texts including kidnapping and murder instructions and threats of torture to Jansenn's wife.

Thompson is scheduled to appear in federal court for a detention hearing Friday morning.

Five other suspects have been arrested in the case.

Investigators say they're searching for a seventh suspect, Jakym Tibbs, who's considered armed and dangerous.

He is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs about 155 pounds.

U.S. Attorney Thomas G. Walker promised he will continue to pursue everyone involved.

'This deliberate attack on our judicial system cannot be tolerated.' he said.
