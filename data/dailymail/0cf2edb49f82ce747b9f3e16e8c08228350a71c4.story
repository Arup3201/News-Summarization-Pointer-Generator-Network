Pro-Ukrainian fighters almost killed themselves attempting to destroy a key road transport route in the pro-Russian breakaway Donetsk Oblast region - after misjudging the amount of explosives to use.

Filmed as they position themselves behind sandbags, the men's laughter soon turns to panic as the explosives cause far more damage than they had intended, and rocks rain down on them.

They run and cower as the skyline erupts into flames.

The
 massive explosion had been designed to destroy a road bridge connecting
 the towns of Gorlivka and Dzerzhinsk.

Pro-Ukrainian fighters almost killed themselves after using too much explosives to destroy a key road transport route in the pro-Russian breakaway Donetsk Oblast region

The men can be seen positioned behind sandbags. But their laughter soon turns to panic as the explosives cause far more damage than they had intended

The men, described by leaders in the breakaway Donetsk republic as terrorists, first set up the explosives and watch from behind piles of sandbags.

The footage then shows huge chunks of rock also raining down around them as they flee in panic.

The blast was so severe it also scattered debris onto the railroad between Nikitovka and Dileevka at a point around a kilometre from the Mayorskaya railway station.

Aleksey Ivanov, 34, was involved in the cleanup operation in an attempt to get road traffic and train traffic moving again.

The blast was so severe it turned the sky orange and scattered debris onto the railroad between Nikitovka and Dileevka at a point around a kilometre from the Mayorskaya railway station

He said that it was clear from the video that the men had been taken by surprise by the force of the explosion.

He said: 'The blast may well have caused serious injuries although we obviously haven't got any official line on that as these people were terrorists and they aren't going to check themselves into a local hospital.'

Separatists in the Donetsk Oblast region declared independence from Ukraine on 7 April, 2014, following the Crimean crisis.

The decision was backed up in a referendum the followed on May 11, although tt has not yet been officially recognised as a separate republic by any foreign country.

Since then the region has been plunged into civil unrest, punctuated with a spate of terrorist attacks which many in the area believe are a prelude to an attempt to take back the region.

In recent days three bridges have been blown up in the Donetsk region.

A motorway bridge on the Rostov-Kharkov highway,  a railway bridge at the settlement of Novobakhmutovka; and a bridge at the settlement of Zakotnoye were destroyed last week.

Railway lines have also been blasted on the Skotovataya-Yasinovatay section of Donetsk railways.

Two bridges across the Seversky Donetsk River and the Tepla River have also been blown up in the Luhansk region. 

National Security and Defense Council's spokesman Andrei Lysenko said that they had also discovered incidents where mines have been laid on highways and surfaced roads which although probably targeting military columns move also risked killing civilians.

At least one armored carrier has already been blown up by a mine at the settlement of Krasnaya Zvezda, Donbass.

Lysenko said tackling the terrorists was a tough job, adding: 'We cannot control the whole border between Ukraine and Russia.'
