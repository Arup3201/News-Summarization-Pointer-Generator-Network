She's a globally renowned style icon and recently designed her own footwear collection for Aquazzura so it's hardly surprising that Olivia Palermo is considering her own fashion range.

The stylish star, who shot to fame on MTV's The City, has hinted at plans to make a foray into designing.

In an interview with The Edit, Net-a-Porter's online magazine, the 28-year-old admitted that she has accounted for a label in her ten year plan.

'I would love to start my own [fashion] house but it’s not the right time. I feel like I can do it in stages and when the timing is right to do it, then I will,' she revealed.

It's only a matter of time: Olivia Palermo was recently named one of the ten best-dressed women in the world and has revealed to The Edit that she wants to start a fashion line one day

And she's had plenty of practice; Palermo has already designed a footwear collection, modelled for some of fashion's biggest names and has been managing her own website since 2011.

'[The website] came from my travels and my friends constantly asking me, "Oh, I’m going to Berlin, I’m going to London, I’m going to Madrid... Can you recommend any great spots to visit?" So [the site] evolved through my experiences of travel, places I like, people I like, and shows,' she said.

'I have three people that work on the editorial side on a daily basis, an entire team who handle the back-end, and myself. I have my hands full at the moment.'

The 28-year-old also shared the secrets behind her acclaimed polished style. 'My mother and grandmother are very pulled together,' she said.

'They never leave the house without being completely, 100 per cent presentable and that was instilled in me at a very young age.' 

Offering her advice on pulling an outfit together seamlessly, the socialite and model said: 'As you get dressed, take a look to see if anything needs to be done.

'I tend to go with the detailing. I have endless skinny belts. There is always a place for a big belt, but sometimes when you’re layering pieces you need to hide the belt and a skinny one does just that.

'Take a razor blade to a sweater if it’s bobbling - it takes the balls off. Double-sided tape is also one of my favorites. Oh, and if you want to roll your sleeves up and they won’t stay, push them up with very thin hair elastics.'

Selective: The star recently collaborated with Aquazzura on a shoe collection and says she decided to work with the brand because their shoes are 'aesthetically phenomenal and fit like a glove'

Taking notes? The former reality TV star was a fixture at Paris Fashion Week

Olivia  tested the designer waters earlier this year when she was asked to collaborate with footwear brand Aquazzura on a capsule collection.

Speaking about the experience, she said: 'I’ve known Edgardo [Osorio, the brand’s designer and founder] since his first collection and he’s become a great friend of mine. I only want to team up and design with people who I have a solid relationship with. 

'There is a very small handful of shoe designers of whom you can say [the shoes] are aesthetically phenomenal and fit like a glove; Manolo [Blahnik] is one of them, and Edgardo. With this, we wanted to create the shoes every woman wants in her wardrobe. 

'Edgardo and I both like a little toe cleavage, and [the heels] had to be high. The heel is actually the highest he’s ever done, so it was a bit of an experiment, but I think it came out very well, they’re still walkable. You don’t want to waddle in the street.'

The former reality TV star has been a fixture at fashion month, perhaps taking inspiration for her future range. Watch this space.
