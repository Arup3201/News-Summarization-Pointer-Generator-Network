Difficult job: Detectives are asking members of the public if they recognise this man - who appears to be headless in this image - following a series of arson attacks in Harrow

When detectives find a picture of that vital person they need to speak too following a crime, it makes their job all the more easier.

But the Metropolitan Police may find it difficult to track down this man.

Officers are asking members of the public if they recognise him following a series of arson attacks in Harrow.

There is just one problem - he appears to be headless.

A source at the Metropolitan Police confirmed it was the best image they had of the man they want to speak too.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is not believed anybody has yet identified him.

Detective Sergeant Andy Simpson, of 
Harrow CID, who is investigating the fire, said: 'The quality of the 
image is quite grainy, and the suspect is covering his face, however we 
are releasing this image in the hope that someone may recognise this 
person by the clothes he is wearing, his build or even his gait.

'It's often the case that a CCTV image of a person may appear 
unrecognisable but can often be identified by someone they live with or 
work closely with.'

Police believe the man could hold vital information following a fire at Cedars Hall in Harrow Weald in January, which caused damage to a door and the roof of the building.

Detectives think this incident could be linked to a series of arson attacks in the Harrow Weald area.

This includes one in the early hours of 
Sunday in which eight London Fire Brigade engines attended to reports of
a fire at the rear of a tyre shop in Long Elmes, Harrow which had 
spread to the Post Office next door.

Residents from the flats above the premises were evacuated following the blaze.

Unique features: Hampshire Police 
issued this very strange e-fit image of a man in 2010

Other police forces have previously being criticised over unusual e-fits which they have released.

Police in Hampshire were branded 'absolutely ludicrous' after issuing an e-fit of a burglary suspect with what appeared to be a lettuce balanced on his head

Residents were astounded when confronted with the image, with many ridiculing the artist's impression.

One local declared: 'It looks more like a
bald man stood in front of an iceberg lettuce. I can't imagine anyone 
actually has a hairstyle like that.

Odd: Police in Hampshire also released this e-fit of a boy believed to be just nine

'It's absolutely ludicrous - the funniest e-fit I have ever seen.'

The same force was also criticised for issuing an e-fit of a boy believed to be just nine years old - below the age of criminality, meaning even if he was caught he could not have been prosecuted.

The wanted boy was said to have knocked another youngster to the ground and kicked him in the head when he refused to let go of his toy in a park.

Hampshire police defended the move, saying there was no CCTV in the Portsmouth park where the assault happened.
