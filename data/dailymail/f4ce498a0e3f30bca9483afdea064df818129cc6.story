It appears Lukas Podolski's 'selfie' influence has rubbed off on Arsenal team-mate Alexis Sanchez.

Sanchez posted a picture via his Twitter account with the whole Chile squad while on international duty on Monday night, where he needed to use a camera stick to be able to fit everyone in.

The South American squad can be seen all smiles as they each pose with miniature 2015 Copa America mascot toys ahead of next year's tournament, which they will host.

The 2015 mascot, was revealed earlier on Monday to be in the guise of a young Culpeo fox, but a name for it has yet to be determined.

As the hosts, Chile have been seeded in Pot 1 alongside Argentina and Brazil ahead of the draw for the 12-team event which will take place on November 24.

Sanchez, who has been in scintillating form for the Gunners since his £30million move from Barcelona this summer, scored the opener in his country's 5-0 friendly win against Venezuela on Friday night as he demonstrated his fox in the box instincts.

The 25-year-old will be looking to add to his international goal tally on Wednesday when Chile entertain Uruguay.
