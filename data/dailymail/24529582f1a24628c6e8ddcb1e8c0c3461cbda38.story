Temur Ketsbaia has stuck to his pledge to quit as Georgia manager.

The former Newcastle midfielder said that Friday's European Championship qualifier with Poland would be the final game of his five-year tenure as a result of a shocking start to their bid to reach France 2016.

The 46-year-old said he would leave his post regardless of the result, but a 4-0 loss to Poland was unlikely to result in a change of heart.

Ketsbaia was a charismatic and colourful character during a spell with Newcastle in the 1990's

'I have already spoken at full length recently so I have nothing new to say,' he told UEFA's official website afterwards.

'Unfortunately my tenure with the national side has ended in a sad manner. From now on I will be supporting the team as an ordinary fan.'

Ketsbaia had managed in Greece before taking the job, while as a player he had spells with Newcastle and Wolves, making his name in England after a fiery goal celebration which saw him smash an advertising board.
