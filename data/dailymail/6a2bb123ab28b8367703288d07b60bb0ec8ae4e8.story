Authorities are probing the ‘suspicious’ deaths of one-month-old identical twin boys, whose mother called 911 to report they were not breathing.

Kiarra Kimbell, of Pocatello, Idaho, called the emergency services at 8:35am yesterday morning and the babies were taken to hospital.

But Gabriel and Tryce Medrano - who neighbours said looked to be in good health on Sunday - were pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.

Autopsies were planned last night to determine the cause of the deaths. The area around their mother’s home was cordoned off with police tape.

Ms Kimbell lives with two other 
children and she travelled in one of the ambulances taking the twins to 
hospital, reported the Idaho State Journal.

Neighbours said the twins seemed to look well on Sunday. The twins were taken to Portneuf Medical Center by the ambulances.

‘Our hearts go out to the family 
having to deal with such a tragedy,’ Police Lieutenant Paul Manning told
the Idaho State Journal.

worth it. I love them so much.'

A month before the babies’ birth in 
October he posted pictures of himself dancing with friends and lists 
himself as ‘single’ on his profile.
