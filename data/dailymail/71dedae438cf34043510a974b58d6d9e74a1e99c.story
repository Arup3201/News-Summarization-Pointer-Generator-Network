A little dishy wasn't quite big enough for this fishy - nor was the door of Rab McAleese's restaurant.

The owner of the Little Italy eatery in Dumfries forked out £1,500 the huge halibut and had it shipped to his restaurant in a refrigerated truck.

Only when it arrived did Mr McAleese realise just how big the seven-foot tall, 16-stone whopper actually was.

The 38-year-old restaurateur had to resort to filleting the 103kg fish in the restaurant forecourt with the help of fellow chef Ashley Rainbow before he could get it into the kitchen on the second floor.

Passers-by watched in amazement as they laid plastic on the ground and set to the halibut with knives.

'We got a call from the fish market saying one of the trawlers had caught this huge fish and asked if I would be interested in taking it,' Mr McAleese said.

'I jumped at the chance because we specialise in seafood dishes and I wanted to have a halibut week at the restaurant.

'I didn't realise how big it was until it arrived though. I was stunned.

'Our kitchen is upstairs and there was no way we could fit it inside. I hadn't really given it much thought before it arrived.

'Myself and my chef Ashley had to take it off the bone outside.

'It took about an hour and people passing by couldn't believe it, we stopped the traffic on the street outside and nearly caused an accident.

'The fish was very heavy and it was very slippery to handle.

'We had to get three guys to suspend it with a rope from our top window just to get our photo taken with it.'

Mr McAleese paid £15 a kilo - £1,545 in total - for the halibut at Glasgow Fish Market after it was line caught off the north coast of Scotland.

The 200 that he managed to carve it into were gobbled up by diners in less than a week.

Mr McAleese added: 'There was a lot of talk about it in the town because so many people had saw it when it arrived.

'It sold it in less than a week.

'Catches like that are fairly rare but I would definitely buy another one.'

Shell out: The fish cost £15 per kilo and cost £1,545 in total

At 16 stones, Rab's fish is still somewhat shy of the largest halibut ever caught - a 34st whopper caught by German angler Gunther Hansel in 2010, which was sold for £2,500.

The previous largest halibut was a 33st fish caught off Norway in 2009.

Earlier this year, staff at the Crabshakk restaurant in Glasgow took delivery of an 11st halibut.

Atlantic halibut are among the largest fish in the world and can grow up to 15ft long.
