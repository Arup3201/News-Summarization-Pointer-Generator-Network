Gareth Bale admits he is still struggling to grasp Spanish, despite enjoying a stellar debut season at Real Madrid.

The Wales forward moved to Spain in September but says boss Carlo Ancelotti's team-talks are translated to him by Luka Modric and coach Paul Clement.

In an 
interview with BT Sport's Clare Balding, the 24-year-old said: 'Yes, 
everything is in Spanish. At the start I used to obviously speak to Paul
 [Clement] after, he knew what the team talk was about before Carlo made
 it so obviously I used to speak with him.'

Language barrier: Real Madrid star Gareth Bale admits he is finding it difficult to grasp Spanish since his move

Bale,
 who moved to the Bernabeu for a world record fee of £86million from Spurs, 
added: 'Now I’ve been here for eight or so months I’ve started to pick 
up on what’s being said and if I don’t understand something I’ll go and 
speak to Paul or maybe speak to Luka or one of the boys who speaks both 
languages to as what they said.

'I
 suppose in a period of time I’m going to get used to listening to and 
hearing the language and hopefully not in the too far distant future 
I’ll be able to understand it fully.'

The
 midfielder has featured 42 times for Real this season, scoring 20 goals
 and assisting 14 as they look to add a tenth European crown to 
the Copa del Rey they won against eternal rivals Barcelona in 
April.

After hammering defending champions Bayern Munich 5-1 on aggregate in their semi-final, Real
 will face city foes Atletico in the Champions League final on May 
24 in Lisbon. 

The opportunity to be part of the club's history to win their 
much-fabled 'La Decima' is one that Bale relishes in the first 
all-Madrid final.

'Yes,
 it’s going to be very interesting. I think it’s the first time it’s 
ever happened with one major city having two teams in the final but it’s
 going to be a difficult game,' he added.

'We
 know how well they’ve played this season and we know what we’re capable
 of so I think as long as we execute our game plan on the day then 
hopefully we do win and yes, I think we have a lot of confidence going 
into the game and something we’re looking forward to. 

'Obviously it would be a dream if we lift the trophy.'
