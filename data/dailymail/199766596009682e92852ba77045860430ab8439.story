From the grim-faced Edwardian woman in her patterned dress to the unsmiling visage of photographer Robert Cornelius, the world's oldest selfies are a surprisingly joyless bunch.

But while modern selfies are just for fun, for the pioneering posers of the 1800s, photographic self-portraits were revolutionary.

Now Mashable.com has rounded up some of the best - and the results are surprisingly impressive.

Stunning: This image, which dates from 1900, shows a female photographer and her Box Brownie

Along with the woman standing beside her Kodak Box Brownie, there are group shots and even one taken outdoors in what appears to be the Alps.

Other shots include a 1930s effort of a beautifully dressed woman posing with what looks like a trophy and a wonderful close-up of a tweed-suited gent taken in 1938.

Like the modern selfie trend, which appeared in the wake of the social media and iPhone revolution, the vintage version was also the result of a technical innovation.

The camera - and modern photography - began life in 1790 with a basic model created by the UK's Thomas Wedgwood, which, by 1826, had been developed into a device resembling modern cameras by French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce.

By 1838, human beings had made their first appearance on film - an event swiftly followed by the first selfie, which was the work of American photographer Robert Cornelius and taken in 1839.

But the era of the selfie didn't truly dawn until 1900, when Kodak's revolutionary Box Brownie Camera appeared on shelves.

Priced at just $1 each, the cardboard device took two inch photos on 117mm roll film and sold in the millions.

The Box Brownie was cheap, easy to use, and even helped to introduce the world to the concept of the snapshot.

And as the image of the Edwardian woman, her Box Brownie poised at waist height, proves, it also helped to popularise the selfie.

Launched in February 1900, the Kodak Box Brownie was the first mass-produced camera.

Easy to use and, at just a dollar each, cheap to buy, it revolutionised the art of photography - until then available only to a limited number of very wealthy people.

Made from cardboard and in possession of a simple meniscus lens, it look tiny two-inch square photos at the push of a button.

Unlike modern cameras, the viewfinder was perched on the top which meant users had to hold the device at waist height and look down.

Later models included a bakelite version, the Brownie 127, of which millions were sold between 1952 and 1967.

There was also a slightly more expensive spin-off model, the Beau Brownie, which used a more advanced doublet lens and were smaller than their conventional counterparts.

Although the Box Brownie is no longer in production, many historical examples are still in existence and, if cared for well enough, can still create wonderful photos today.
