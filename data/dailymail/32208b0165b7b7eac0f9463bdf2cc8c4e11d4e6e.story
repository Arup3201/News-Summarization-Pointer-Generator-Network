The cause of death of a man who collapsed in a San Diego Border Patrol holding cell on Christmas Eve after he was taken into custody for allegedly carrying three pounds of marijuana, is being investigated by the County Medical Examiner's office.

U.S. citizen Steven Keith, 58, was stopped at a checkpoint on Interstate 8, near the Mexican border.

He was arrested and taken to a holding cell at the Campo Border Patrol station after authorities said they found marijuana, drug paraphernalia and traces of methamphetamine in his car.

Steven Keith even had moved to Thailand years ago but was visiting family in San Diego for the holidays when he died

Several hours after sitting in a holding cell, officials said Keith became ‘incoherent and unresponsive.’

Border Patrol emergency medical technicians performed CPR on Keith while waiting on paramedics to arrive. Paramedics took over life-saving efforts but were unable to revive Keith, officials said.

Keith's sister Janet, who lives in Texas, said Steven had moved to Thailand years ago but was visiting family in San Diego for the holidays.

Janet said the medical examiner told her an autopsy was done, but they couldn't release the cause of death for 90 days while toxicology tests are being completed, reports ABC10.

Janet, a former police officer, said her brother was in good health. He had no partner or children.

‘I am a former police officer myself and I definitely want some answers and I’m going to get them,’ she told UT San Diego.

‘Customs and Border Protection's San Diego Sector Border Patrol is cooperating fully with these investigators to ensure a neutral third party reviews all evidence and information surrounding this unfortunate death,’ said a statement released by the Border Patrol.

The Department of Homeland Security Office of Investigator General is also investigating the incident.

Alliance San Diego, a human rights organization, is monitoring the incident as well.

‘Border Patrol is under a whole lot of pressure to make sure their agents are properly trained and to make sure when cases like this happen information is properly given to the family,' said Christian Ramirez with Alliance San Diego.
