A car mechanic who posted videos online of himself driving erratically at terrifying speeds has been jailed for causing the death of a teenage girl and injuring four others.

Martin Li, from Hexham, Northumberland, admitted killing 18-year-old Lucy Duggan in a head on crash as he raced his turbo charged Ford Focus while high on cannabis.

The chilling series of dash-cam videos, filmed in the weeks leading up to the crash, show Li driving at terrifying speeds along country roads, some with accompanying messages that reveal a bitter contempt for other drivers, pedestrians and cyclists.

In the hours before the accident, the 22-year-old collected Ms Duggan, along with friends Alex Crowe and Lauren Jewitt, after agreeing to give them a lift to nearby Corbridge on August 25.

But he began to drive at excessive speeds, in a car he had only gained insurance for after lying about his age.

'New motor': Weeks before the accident, Li was handed the keys to his 150mph Ford Focus ST before posting a picture of himself with the car alongside the words: 'New motor :).'

Newcastle Crown Court heard that before the crash, the girls in the car had begun to scream for him to stop as they said he reached speeds of 130mph.

Paul Rowland, prosecuting, said he had floored the accelerator, at one point overtaking two vehicles in a single manoeuvre, and said the bends were his 'favourite bit'.

Danger: Before the accident, Li posted a number of hair-raising dash-cam videos in which he is seen driving at excessive speeds and dangerously close to other cars on narrow country roads

Stupid: This still from one of his videos shows him speeding past a marked police car

He added: 'According to friends and witnesses he is a fast driver. He had in fact posted videos on You tube which does in fact demonstrate this.

'On the day of the accident the defendant was driving at greatly excessive speed.

'He paid no attention to the road markings and he had personal knowledge of the road so he should have been aware of the dangers.'

As they approached a sharp left turn over a bridge, he crossed over to the other side of the road in an attempt to straighten out the bend.

But on returning to the correct side of the road, the car began to skid across the carriageway and smashed into an oncoming vehicle.

Li emerged from the car 'virtually unscathed' but Ms Duggan was left with fatal internal injuries.

'Be warned, cyclists!' One of his Facebook posts reveals a bitter contempt for cyclists

'Guna go twice as fast tomorro!!' He also posted a string of Facebook messages boasting about his fast driving

The other two passengers and the mother and daughter in the other car were all seriously injured.

Pleading guilty to a charge of causing death by dangerous driving in August, Li also admitted four counts of causing injury by dangerous driving as well as making false statements to obtain insurance.

Mr Rowland said Li had smoked cannabis with Crowe, one of the passengers in the car, before the fatal crash.

Mr Rowland said: 'They drove his vehicle into Hexham to pick up his mother before returning home.

'Mr Li and Alex Crowe both shared a joint of cannabis in his garage about 4.30pm.

'About 7pm they picked up Lauren and Lucy. They agreed to pay five pounds petrol money to Mr Li to take them through to Corbridge.'

Robert Patton, defending, said: 'He has never tried to minimise the harm he has caused to the family.

'His mental health has deteriorated. He appears to be punishing himself mentally, he is unable to sleep. He is a quiet and extremely lonely person. He lives his life for his family.'

Weeks before the accident, Li was handed the keys to his 150mph Ford Focus ST before posting a picture of himself with the car alongside the words: 'New motor :).'

Thereafter, he posted a number of hair-raising dash-cam videos in which he is seen driving at excessive speeds and dangerously close to other cars, Sky Tyne and Wear reported.

In one, he drives terrifyingly close to a motorbike carrying a pillion 
passenger on a road just outside Alston, before overtaking on a hairpin 
bend.

Chillingly, his friends even warn him of the dangers of driving too fast, telling him to slow down to avoid a serious accident.

'No words': The judge told li he had 'blighted the lives' of Lucy's friends, especially her that of her father

Foreboding: Chillingly, his friends even warn him of the high speeds he reaches, telling him to slow down to avoid causing a serious accident

Concern: Another friend warns Li of the consequences of driving too fast

Four weeks before the fatal crash, he described on Facon Facebook: 'do 1 ya stupid old hag, guna go twice as fast tomorro!'

And in another he revealed his contempt for cyclists sharing the road.

'F****** cyclists riding on the roads be warned, I will come passed you as close and as fast as I can,' he ranted. 'Don’t like it? Get on the f****** path!'

Sentencing Li to eight years in jail, Judge John Evans said the speed he was doing and the nature of the road made a collision inevitable.

He said the police had found videos online in which he had been driving extremely fast and that speeding was something he craved.

'You have blighted their lives and in particular that of Lucy’s father,' he said.

'No sentence I can possibly impose today can begin to compensate them for the loss of their loved one who will occupy their thoughts indefinitely.

'You killed someone needlessly and selfishly and if it haunts you for the rest of your life no one will shed a tear or deem it fitting.'

Imposing a driving ban of ten years, Judge Evans said he had wrought appalling devastation on five families, including his own.

A statement released today from Lucy Duggan's family - parents Ralph and Barbara and brother Jack - said: 'The devastating accident that took our wonderful daughter from us on Sunday, August 25, has rocked our world and shattered so many precious dreams.

'Lucy loved life and lived it to the full, her constant smile brought sunshine into the lives of all she met.

'She lived her life in full confidence that everything would be OK and we have tried to draw from her positive outlook to get us through.

'The support that our family, friends and the wonderful community we live in have shown us has been amazing and given us great strength. Lucy was always there when we needed support and we have been left feeling helpless without her.

'May the sunshine in her outlook of life give us all strength to carry on without her'.
