Jose Enrique seems to have used the international break to start acting the fool - and maybe that is what inspired his new facial hair. 

The Spanish full back has grown a Charlie Chaplin-style moustache and, unlike his apparent inspiration, was determined not to stay silent and proudly displayed it on Twitter.

It seems his girlfriend was not laughing about it, however.

Enrique, 28, jokingly tweeted: 'Surprised my girlfriend with a new style of beard this morning, She didn't like it very much.. hahahahaha @AmyJaine.'

Unfortunately for Chaplin and Enrique a certain 20th century dictator has rather tarnished the reputation of the 'toothbrush moustache'.

Chaplin was born in east London in 1889 and was best known as an actor and comedian during the era of silent films.

His best known movies include The Gold Rush (1925), City Lights (1931) and 1940s The Great Dictator, in which he satirised Adolf Hitler. 

Chaplin made people laugh and we're sure Enrique's tribute moustache will have brought a smile to his Liverpool team-mates' faces - even if his girlfriend was not impressed.
