A former Olympic gymnast who was advised by doctors to abort two of her triplets has given birth to three healthy baby girls.

Jaime Halsey and her rugby star husband Steve, both 35, were told they were expecting triplets in October, but were quickly referred to specialists who said the odds of them all surviving was 50/50

Last week the couple, from Abington, Northampton, welcomed Eden Rose, Amber Joy and Erin Aila via a planned caesarean section.

Proud parents: The smallest of the Halsey triplets, Erin Aila, born to former Olympic trampolinist, Jaime Halsey and her rugby star husband Steve, both 35

After finding out they were expecting triplets, the Halseys were quickly referred to specialists after the 12 week scan when medics realised one of them was 25 per cent smaller than the other.

Doctors advised Jaime to consider terminating two of her unborn children because they could cause serious risks to her health as well as the other babies.

But Jaime, who was Team GB's first female trampolinist, refused an abortion - despite the odds of all three surviving being just 50 per cent.. 

The trio were born last Tuesday, with only minor complications before being placed into incubators for further care at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.

The couple, from Abington, Northampton, delivered the good news via an online blog they have been keeping of their experience.

Jaime who represented Team GB at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, described the birth as 'the most amazing, yet surreal experience of my life, and I loved every minute.'

She added: 'I felt so overwhelmed, I had heard each one cry and been able to see them it was just the best feeling ever.'

Eden Rose was the first to arrive into the world at 3.53pm, weighing 3lb 8oz.

She was closely followed by Amber Joy at 3.54pm, weighing in at 3lb 1oz.

Then at 3.55pm Erin Aila was born, and weighed 2lb 13oz.

Earlier this year Jaime, who coaches trampolining and runs a cake-making business from home, spoke of her determination to deliver all three babies.

She said: 'Other people have triplets and I wasn't prepared to abort two healthy babies just to make life easier.

'My initial emotional reaction was 'I can't do that, I will keep them all and carry on with the pregnancy whatever'.

'Collectively we made the decision we would give the three babies the best opportunity we possibly could to come into the world.

'As sport has taught us both, all you need is a chance, positivity and the faith of others in your ability to be a success.'

Jaime was Team GB's first female trampolinist at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and after some time out recovering from injuries, she earned the team their place in the Beijing Games in 2008 and was then a reserve

Former London Welsh and Bedford Blues rugby player Steve, who is now a PE teacher also, also wrote of his delight on the couple's blog.

He said: 'We would proudly like to welcome into the world our beautiful daughters, middle names Rose and Joy after our Mum's and Aila meaning 'from a strong place'.

'Now our journey really begins.

'I was allowed the opportunity to tell and show Jaime how immensely proud of her I am for growing and housing three beautiful little girls to complement our beautiful daughter Florence.'

The couple had their first daughter Flo in 2012 and began trying for another baby in spring last year after the two-year-old started asking for a sister.

After falling pregnant scans revealed she had two monozygotic identical twins and one 'singleton' in her womb.

Consultants told them twins sharing a placenta are at risk of twin-to-twin syndrome of IUGR (Intrauterine Growth Restriction).

Doctors said adding another baby into the equation has made her pregnancy particularly high-risk and even more rare and complicated.

The triplets will now be transferred to Northampton General Hospital to further monitoring but should be able to return home next week.
