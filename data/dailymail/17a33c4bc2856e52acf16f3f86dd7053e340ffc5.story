Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has been hospitalized three weeks after he broke seven ribs after he was thrown from a horse while  on safari in Africa over Christmas.

Doctors had expected him to recover on his own from the accident, but on Monday he was admitted to the hospital when a test found fluid collecting around his lungs as a result of the weeks-old injury.

The 57-year-old Democrat will stay at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center overnight and then is expected to be 'back in action' after two to three days.

The McAuliffe family went to Africa to visit the governor's oldest daughter, Dori, who works for a nonprofit in Zambia.Â 

He was on a 'once-in-a-lifetime' safari on horseback in Tanzania around Christmas Day when something spooked his horse and it threw him to the ground.

'It's fair to say it's not his favorite choice of activities,' spokesman Brian Coy said of his boss and his ill-fated ride.

Coy stressed that McAuliffe has been working since the accident, including delivering his State of the Commonwealth address last week and a visit to Norfolk on Monday.

'He's been going about his job. This isn't a dire thing,' Coy said.

In a statement, House Speaker William J. Howell said his thoughts were with the governor.

'I wish him a speedy recovery,' he said.
