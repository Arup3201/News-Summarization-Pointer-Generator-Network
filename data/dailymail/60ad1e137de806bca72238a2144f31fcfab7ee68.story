A block of luxury seaside penthouses have been lying empty since February following a legal row over a six-inch strip of land.

Developers of the £1m flats have been locked in a long-running legal battle with the owners of a 'ransom strip' which runs between the newly-built flats and a neighbouring block.

But now the developers of the Nirvana apartments, in the Leas, Westcliff, Essex, which were completed earlier this year but have still not gone on the market, have said the matter is 'about to be resolved'.

The luxury seaside Nirvana apartments were completed earlier this year but are still not on the market following a legal row over a six-inch strip of land

Owners of the ransom strip have said residents of the flats would not be able to use the underground car park because they would have to drive over the disputed land

The 45 apartments were approved by Southend Council in 2007 and the development was finished earlier this year but they are still not on the market

The owners of the ransom strip have previously said residents of the flats would not be able to use the underground car park because they would have to drive over the disputed land.

Mike Gray, managing director of Dedman Gray, the marketing agent for the site, indicated a resolution was close.

He said: 'The strip of land did stall the marketing during the summer months and this matter quite clearly is about to be resolved.

'Taking into consideration the December and Christmas market is soon upon us, the relaunch and full marketing of these apartments will now be set up for the middle of January in the New Year.'

Lucy Courtenay, secretary of the local Chalkwell Ward Residents’ Association, said: 'The view was that it’s not the most attractive of buildings but having built it, it’s a great shame it’s still standing empty.'

Jane Hendry, also a member of the association, said: 'We’ve been trying to find out the situation from our councillors, but there seems to be little information available.'

Ransom strips, commonly used between developments, are lodged with the Land Registry and prevent any extension or encroachment by a neighbouring property

The three owners of the strip have previously said there had been no agreement allowing residents of the Nirvana flats (pictured during development) to cross it to reach the parking area

The 45 flats were approved by Southend 
Council in 2007, and the nine-storey development was finished earlier this year after the economic downturn slowed down work.

However the owners of the 100yards by 6in strip, which lies between the flats and neighbouring Bellway Court, appointed a legal team alleging Nirvana’s developers do not have permission to cross their so-called ransom strip.

Ransom strips, commonly used between developments, are lodged with the Land Registry and prevent any extension or encroachment by a neighbouring property.

The three owners, who sold the neighbouring land in the 1980s but retained ownership of the ransom strip, had previously said there had been no agreement allowing Nirvana residents to cross it to reach the concealed parking area.
