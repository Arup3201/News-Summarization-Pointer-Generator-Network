Back in jail: Six months after Missouri judge freed Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson from jail, where he landed after avoiding prison time for 13 years due to a clerical error, the 37-year-old man was charged with second-degree robbery 

Six months after a Missouri judge freed Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson from jail proclaiming him 'a changed man,' the married father of four landed behind bars once again, this time on a robbery charge. 

Anderson has made national headlines earlier this year when the St Louis resident was sent to jail after having avoided incarceration for 13 years because of a clerical error.

The 37-year-old husband and father was set free in May of this year, but at around 1am Sunday he was arrested and charged with second-degree robbery for allegedly grabbing a woman's purse from her shoulder and briefly dragging her in St. Louis. 

Prosecutors say Anderson matched a description from the victim and a witness, but his attorney says police made a big mistake. Anderson has since been released on $10,000 bond.

‘There was a report of a man who completely and totally did not match my client's description as the alleged purse snatcher,’ his attorney, Patrick Megaro, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ‘It makes me wonder what is going on out there in St. Louis.’ 

Anderson was sentenced to 13 years in prison for the armed robbery of a Burger King worker in St. Charles County, just north of St. Louis, in 2000.

More legal trouble: Anderson, pictured walking out of the courtroom with his family in May, is accused of snatching a woman's purse in St Louis Sunday 

He waited for information on when and where to report to prison, but the order never came. Anderson later started his own carpentry business, married, had children, coached youth football and volunteered at his church in Webster Groves, a suburb of St. Louis. 

When prison officials found the clerical error in July 2013, as Anderson's prison term was set to end, eight US marshals were sent to his home and took him to prison. He remained in jail until May. 

‘You've been a good father,’ Judge Terry Lynn Brown said during a hearing May 5, when he set Anderson free. ‘You've been a good husband. You've been a good taxpaying citizen of the state of Missouri.

‘That leads me to believe that you are a good man and a changed man.’

Speaking to Daily Riverfront Times Monday, Anderson's father, Michael Anderson, said that his son was taken into custody upon leaving his employer’s birthday party.

'He didn't do it,' said Mr Anderson. 'He was with 40 other people the entire evening.'

Mike Anderson's lawyer reiterated that his client has a solid alibi, given that he had been at the party the entire night and left to go home with his wife only at around 1am.

Attorney Patrick Megaro also took issue with the purse snatcher's description, saying that according to police, the suspect was a black male dressed in a hoodie and Nike sneakers, while Mike Anderson was wearing a leather jacket, slacks and light brown boots that night.

The lawyer noted that his client did not have the victim's purse or any of her other personal effects in his possession at the time of his arrest.

Mr Megaro and Anderson's family have suggested that his checkered past and the notoriety surrounding his release have swayed the responding police officer to take the 37-year-old man into custody.

‘The past is never the past, and the reality is, when they run his name and they see this in his record, he'll never get the benefit of the doubt,’ said the lawyer.

On Monday evening, Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce released a statement saying that the victim of the Sunday night mugging identified Mike Anderson as her assailant on two separate occasions: the first time just steps away from the crime scene on South Broadway, and the second time during a formal police line-up.

Alibi: Anderson's family and his attorney say that the 37-year-old man could not have committed the robbery because he had spent the whole night at a birthday party, surrounded by as many as 40 people 

Everything to lose: Anderson's attorney said his client would not have jeopardized his life and family for a purse 

Also, Joyce asserted that the victim never described the purse-snatcher as sporting a pair of Nikes and a hoodie, but rather a leather jacket and boots similar to the ones worn by Anderson that night.

Patrick Megaro insisted that his client was '100 per cent innocent' and questioned why the married father of four, who only recently has started putting his life back together, would jeopardize everything for a purse.

‘He’s been working, spending time with the family, going to church,’ he said. ‘He’s been doing very well financially, as a matter of fact. A purse snatching involving this individual is completely implausible.’

During an appearance on the Today Show in May, a beaming Mike Anderson described his reunion with his family as a dream come true.

'It's still a dream. It hasn't really sunk in yet,’ he said, holding the hand of his wife, LaQonna.

'They got the wrong guy': Anderson's supporters insist that the 37-year-old man is 100 per cent innocent  

Identified: The victim named Anderson, seen here with his family, as her assailant just minutes after the robbery, and later picked him out from a police line-up 

Mississippi County Associate Circuit Judge Terry Lynn Brown needed just a 10-minute hearing in May before ruling that he was giving Anderson credit for time served for all 4,794 days between his conviction and when he was arrested last year.

‘Very happy,’ Anderson said as he climbed into an SUV for the ride home to suburban St. Louis and a planned family celebration. ‘My faith has always been in God. I'm just so thankful. That God for everybody.’

Attorney General Chris Koster said in a statement at the time: ‘From the outset, I have proposed a solution that balances the seriousness of Mr. Anderson's crime with the mistake made by the criminal justice system and Mr. Anderson's lack of a criminal record over the past 13 years. Today's outcome appears to appropriately balance the facts as we understand them.’

The judge said that rather than grant parole, Anderson would get credit for the entirety of the time he should have been in prison. The distinction is important because it means Anderson doesn't have to report to a parole agent.

Anderson had never been convicted of a serious crime before the robbery. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison for the holdup, then told to wait for orders that would specify when and where he was to report to prison. But the orders never came.

Anderson suspected that his case had been overlooked and asked his former attorney what to do.

‘Day by day, month by month, year by year, time passed, and they never picked me up,’ he said in an interview in April with the Associated Press.

A court filing by the attorney general's office said the mistake happened when a trial court clerk failed to inform the Missouri Supreme Court that Anderson was free on bond after his initial conviction.
