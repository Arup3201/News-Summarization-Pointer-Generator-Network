The snake is patterned like a venomous snake, but is largely harmless, as an adder's venom is treatable, and the snakes are quite rare to see slithering about

At first glance this snake appears to be a venomous sidewinder that has slithered across a desert.

But the serpent is actually an adder that was caught on camera making its way across a sandy beach in Cornwall.

The 3ft long snake was snapped by Tim Hunt who spotted it and its lengthy trail while he watched the sunset at Godrevy beach, near Hayle, Cornwall.

He used his camera tripod to scoop it up away from the incoming tide and moved it to safety behind some sand dunes.

Tim, 25, from Worcestershire, said: 'I was photographing the sunset when I saw a trail in the sand and assumed a child had dragged a stick down the beach.

'It was only whilst walking further down the beach that I noticed there was something at the end of the trail, it turned out to be an adder.

'It was the first time I had seen an adder and I was shocked at how small it was, it was a beautiful creature.

'I was amazed by the great distance it had travelled while being in the open with the danger of being stepped on or taken by predators.

'The sun had set and the snake remained in stasis. Due to snakes being cold blooded its body was starting to shut down.

From far away, the snake seems like a venemous sidewinder that would better fit into a desert

'I was sure that with it being so far out in the middle of the beach and with the incoming tide, its chances of survival were slim.

'So using my tripod I carried the adder to the safety and shelter of the sand dunes behind the beach.'
