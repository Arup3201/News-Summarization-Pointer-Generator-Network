Failed: Andrew Prentice was let down by his local council and NHS trust, an official report has ruled

A seriously ill man died from an overdose of medication after he was left to administer his own treatment by his local council and NHS trust.

Andrew Prentice suffered from pancreatitis for more than two decades before his death at the age of 38, during which time he lost his home and job and his marriage fell apart.

Now Somerset County Council and Somerset Partnership NHS Trust have been criticised for failing the patient by not helping him administer the powerful medication he needed.

Two ombudsmen, one for local government and another with responsibility for health, ordered officials to apologise to Mr Prentice's mother Brenda, who has campaigned since her son's death five years ago.

'If the problems had been recognised and sincere apologies given in the beginning and lessons learned this would not have been necessary,' said Mrs Prentice, 71.

'Deny, defend, delay is often the case with authorities. We need openness, fairness and transparency. I was pleased that the ombudsmen took my complaints seriously.'

Mr Prentice, once a promising sportsman, developed pancreatitis overnight at the age of 15 and had to have his pancreas removed.

He found a job in a shop and got married, but he suffered from chronic abdominal pain, frequently vomited, became diabetic and suffered fits and collapses.

After losing his job, home and marriage, he started suffering from depression, and in July 2009 died from an overdose of prescription drugs.

At an inquest into his death, a coroner heard that the drugs left him so confused he could not remember whether or not he had taken his medication.

However, he recorded an open verdict because he said it was impossible to determine if he had intended to kill himself.

In the report into Mr Prentice's death released last week, Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman Julie Mellor said the NHS trust 'failed' Mr Prentice.

She added: 'This tragic case highlights the importance of joined-up care. It is crucial that the NHS and local authorities communicate with each other to ensure patients' needs are met.

'One missed opportunity by staff can lead to tragic consequences. Staff need to feel empowered to intervene and alert others when they have concerns about a patient.

'The trust failed this young man and it needs to ensure that its staff are appropriately trained in caring for vulnerable people, so that other patients receive the high quality care they deserve.'

Jane Martin of the Local Government Ombudsman said failures to monitor his medication 'may have contributed' to his death.

She added: 'The picture I have seen is one of a gradual decline in the man's health with no effective intervention to prevent it.

'While you cannot put a price on the loss of a loved one, I have recommended a financial payment to the man's family in recognition of the stress and strain this situation must have placed them under.'

Vulnerable: Mr Prentice was left to administer his own medication despite his chronic illness

The report also said the council should refund Mr Prentice's relatives for any care given and review its policy on liaison with internal and external housing agencies.

Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said that at the time of the patient's death, the trust was not in charge of managing district nurses.

A spokesman added: 'We have made considerable progress on this process of integration over the last two years and we are pleased to see this acknowledged in the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman's comments.

'The trust has offered its sincere condolences to the family over the circumstances of Andrew's death and we will write to them again outlining the actions we have taken once we have considered fully the detail of the report.'

Somerset County Council said it was considering the report's findings and was not in a position to comment at this stage. It added: 'We do, of course, offer our sincere sympathies to all friends and family.'
