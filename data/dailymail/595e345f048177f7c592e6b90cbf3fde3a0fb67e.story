Bungling military officials erected a 10ft fence around a US Air Force memorial in case it 'offended Libyan soldiers'.

The 'Memphis Belle' monument was erected at RAF Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, to honour the USAF's Eighth Air Force - who were based there during the Second World War.

Memphis Bell was the nickname given to the Boeing B-17F Flying Fortress bombers flown by the 91st Bomb Group (Heavy) - which suffered huge losses of men between 1942 and 1945.

The US Air Force Memorial was erected at RAF Bassingbourn 20 years ago, left, but was fenced up, right, when it was announced that 2,000 Libyan soldiers were due to relocate to the base for training

But the structure was fenced off when it was announced that 2,000 Libyan soldiers were to be trained at the base.

The Libyans will spend two months training at the base as part of efforts to help disarm the country's government after the removal of despot Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.

After an uproar from enthusiasts and locals alike, officials have now removed the 10ft fence.

The commander responsible for erecting it will be investigated in a Ministry of Defence probe.

A ministry source said the official was 'some bloke with a clipboard' who oversaw an extraordinary 'error of judgement'.

No official comment has been made as to why the fence was put around the monument but the source said: 'I expect the rationale was it might offend the Libyans.'

The 'Memphis Belle' tribute - named after the bombers the USAF's Eight Air Force  flew - from afar. The fence has since been removed following an outcry from locals and enthusiasts alike - and a Ministry of Defence probe launched into the incident

The memorial was erected 20 years ago and USAF veterans frequently make pilgrimages to England to see it to remember their fallen comrades.

One group that regularly visits, Friends of the Eighth, formed almost 40 years ago.

Peter Worby, 55, a long-standing member of the group, said: 'I am glad someone has seen sense but this was a disgusting insult to the memory of the young airmen who died saving our bacon.

'The MoD should be hugely embarrassed by this - they should be promoting these memorials, not shunning them.'

A Facebook page was set up to shame the base after the memorial, which features the propeller of a B-17 bomber, was fenced off.

One member said: 'We are not going to let the veterans down and those who died for us.

'If the MoD wants a row they have got one. We owe the veterans more than we can ever hope to repay - letting them or their memory down doesn't even enter the picture.'

The USFA's Eighth Air Force was based at RAF Bassingbourn during the Second World War.

Its 91st Bomb Group (Heavy) - who were known unofficially as 'The Ragged Irregulars' operated B017 Flying Fortress aircraft, otherwise known as the Memphis Belle bombers.

Between 1942 and 1945, the unit suffered the largest number of losses of any heavy bomb group - losing 197 of its 340 aircraft in 340 operational missions.

887 of the crew were killed - around 19 per cent - and 123 were declared missing in action.

Another branded the move 'disgusting', adding: 'Why do we have to put up with Britain as it is today ? It’s all going down the pan.'

The 91st Bomb Group (Heavy), whose duty it was to fly in the B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft, suffered the greatest number of losses of any heavy bomb group between 1942 and 1945.

The elite unit within the Eighth Air Force participated in 340 operational missions losing 197 of its aircrafts.

887 of the crew were killed - around 19 per cent - and 123 were declared missing in action.

Their missions inspired both a 1944 documentary film called Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress, and a 1990 Hollywood feature film Memphis Belle.

A Defence Infrastructure Organisation 
spokesman said: 'A temporary screen was erected around the US War 
Memorial at Bassingbourn. This has now been removed.'

Libyan armed forces will be taught basic infantry skills as part of a two-month course starting next month at RAF Bassingbourn.

It is part of efforts to help the Libyan government disarm and integrate militias and improve stability following the toppling of despot Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.

US-Libyan relations have been strained since President Ronald Reagan ordered air strikes, code-named Operation El Dorado Canyon, in 1986.

In 2011 America led military intervention in Libya and, with British naval forces, fired more than 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles during the civil war.

Memphis Belle (cast pictured right) was written by Monte Merrick and  directed by Michael Caton-Jones.

It had an all-star cast including Matthew Modine, Eric Stoltz and Harry Connick Jr.

The film was a fictional account of the of the 1943 documentary called Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress. It was about the final, 25th mission, of the Memphis Belle.

The plot of the film is as follows. In May 1943, the crew are grounded while their aircraft is repaired.

Squadron aircraft begin to arrive back - but as the last bomber makes its final descent, it gets in to trouble just before landing.  It explodes, killing its crew.

The next day, officers are told their target for the day is Bremen, Germany - information which riles the experienced men. They are told the squadron will be leading the attack with another 350 aircraft in their bomb group.

The bombers suffer significant losses during the mission and at one point, the Belle is then tasked to lead. 

The remaining squadron aircraft return to the base without the Belle and they wait for its return. In a tense final few scenes, its men struggle to land the bomber - narrowly missing a crash landing.

The film finishes with a dedication to all those who lost their lives in the conflict.
