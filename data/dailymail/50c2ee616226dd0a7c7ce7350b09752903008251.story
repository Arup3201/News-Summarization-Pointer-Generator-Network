Vladmir Putin shows his softer side: the images went viral around the world, but new documents have revealed they came with a hefty price tag

Prime Minister Tony Abbott's wife Margie Abbott arranged for the animals to be transported to the summit by Lone Pine sanctuary so they could be available for photos with the leaders.

According to documents on the Austender website-the Australian Government procurement information system-the exchange cost $24,000 in tax payers money.

Chair of Labor's Waste Watch Committee Pat Conroy has lashed out at the government for the spending.

'The Prime Minister failed monumentally at the G20. He refused to discuss climate change, humiliated himself by raising domestic politics, and proved to be all talk and no action when it came to shirt-fronting Vladimir Putin,' he said to The Daily Telegraph.

'Instead of shirt-fronting President Putin, Tony Abbott spent $24,000 of taxpayer's dollars so Mr Putin could cuddle a koala.'
