A copper knife handle depicting a couple having sex and an animal bone carved into the shape of a penis with wings are among thousands of artefacts unearthed across Britain by amateur treasure hunters.

The erotic art is part of a huge haul of almost 25,000 Roman artefacts - mainly coins - discovered in England and Wales and documented as part of the Portable Antiquities Scheme.

The finds, reported in 2011 and dating back between 1,600 and 2,000 years, also include a copper bust of a bare-chested man - thought to be Antinous, the male lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian - and an unusual silver and gold brooch in the shape of a leaping dolphin.

Explicit: The copper alloy knife handle is carved in the shape of a couple having sex

Amateurs in England and Wales are allowed to use metal detectors to search for artefacts and possibly - depending on the nature of their finds - keep them.

While the treasure hunter who unearthed the lewd copper knife handle in North Yorkshire may have had something of a shock, an expert said it was 'not uncommon' to find sexually explicit iconography in a Roman household.

John Pearce, archaeology lecturer at King's College London, said in an article about the discoveries published in the journal Britannia: 'One theory is that those scenes that show sexual activity have an apotropaic power, because they make you laugh so that wards off the evil eye.'

Another amateur archaeologist stumbled across a penis with a pair of wings that has been carved from animal bone, while a hollow gold pendant in the shape of a penis was also discovered.

'Rare': This unusual brooch in the shape of a leaping dolphin could have been worn by a man or a woman, experts say

Mr Pearce said a three-dimensional dolphin brooch - which could have been worn by either a man or a woman - found in Essex was particularly unusual, according to Foxnews.com.

The lecturer said he had been unable to find an example of another one like it.

The hollow copper bust depicting a bare-chested young man was discovered near Market Rasen in Lincolnshire. While experts can't be certain it is of Hadrian's lover Antinous, the hairstyle closely matchs other statues that are known to be of him.

The affair between Hadrian - who ruled from AD 117 to 138 - and Greek Antinous was widely known and would not have been perceived as unusual at the time.

When Antinous died in Egypt in AD 130, the grief stricken emperor ordered that he be deified, and statues of his dead lover sprung up throughout the empire.

Artefacts: Phallic symbols were a common theme in Roman art

The practice of amateur treasure hunters searching for artefacts in England and Wales is controversial, with some critics arguing it could lead to potential archaeological sites being disturbed and the loss of provenance information.

The government backed Public Antiquities Scheme records all findings in an online public database.
