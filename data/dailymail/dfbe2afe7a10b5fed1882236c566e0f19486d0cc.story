The BBC has been urged to reveal its plans for Scottish independence amidst fears the licence fee could double in the event of a 'Yes' vote in next week's referendum.

The Corporation has so far refused to speculate on what could happen after Thursday's vote, insisting that no contingency plans have been drawn up.

However, senior politicians have called for transparency over the future level of the licence fee, in order to ensure that Scottish voters can make a well-informed decision at the polls.

There are also questions over the future of the many BBC programmes which are currently produced at the Corporation's Scottish headquarters in Glasgow - including hit sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys and political flagship Question Time.

Licence fee: Alex Salmond insists that an independent Scotland would keep the BBC, but there are fears the cost could soar

The latest news comes after businesses continued to speak out against the risks posed by independence, while UKIP leader Nigel Farage suggested that the Queen should intervene in a last-ditch attempt to save the Union.

The Scottish National Party has repeatedly insisted that an independent Scotland would be able to keep the BBC, along with other UK institutions such as the NHS and the Monarchy.

But as the Corporation would no longer be able to subsidise Scottish services from the rest of Britain, it is not know how the level of the licence fee would be affected.

The Guardian reported today that a secret internal document produced by the BBC in 2011 suggested the fee might have to double from £145.50 to nearly £300 in an independent Scotland.

A source told the paper: 'In Scotland, revenue raised is well south of the value of services they receive.'

The BBC is believed to raise around £320million from the 2.2million Scottish licence fee payers, according to the latest available figures.

Most of that money goes on programmes and services broadcast to the whole of the UK, but £102million is spent every year on content intended for an exclusively Scottish audience.

The BBC's Gaelic-language TV station, BBC Alba, is part-funded by the Scottish government, but its other services in the country draw from the overall pot of licence fee payments.

Silence: Rona Fairhead, incoming chairman of the BBC, has supported the Corporation's policy of refusing to plan for an independence vote

In other countries of a comparable size to Scotland, such as Ireland and Denmark, public broadcasting is nearly twice as expensive per head of population as it is in the UK.

The licence fee is Denmark is 2,414 krone, around £260, while in Ireland the €160 (£130) fee makes up only half the income of the public broadcaster RTÉ.

BBC channels which are broadcast outside the UK, such as BBC World and BBC America, are funded by advertising.

The Last Night of the Proms is one of the key dates in the calendar of British patriotism - but this year, the BBC is keen to keep politics out of it altogether.

Presenter and stars of tomorrow night's concert, including Katherine Jenkins and Terry Wogan, are set to be reminded that they must focus on the music - and not mention the Scottish independence referendum.

Politicians and cultural figures have called for the Last Night of the Proms to be a celebration of Britishness ahead of next Thursday's poll.

But the BBC is adamant that it must remain an apolitical event, and will brief those appearing to remind them not to talk about 'things that aren't music related'.

The Corporation insists that this is standard guidance issued every year, but tomorrow's concert is considered particularly symbolic due to the impending referendum.

Historian Simon Schama said this week that the Proms 'might be the last time' for the UK to come together as a whole, and suggested that the historic occasion should be celebrated.

Politicians such as Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, and entertainers including Vera Lynn, agreed that the concert should display the strengths of the Union and Scotland's contribution to national culture.

'The best way of sharing our cultural lives is to stay together,' Dame Vera told the Telegraph. 'Rule Britannia was written by a Scot! This concert is a wonderful opportunity to share our musical heritage.'

However, the BBC is so intent on staying impartial that several of its best-known personalities are believed to have refused show support for the Union in case they breach the Corporation's rules.

'It's business as usual for the Last Night of the Proms,' a BBC spokesman said. 'There is no heavy edict not to mention the referendum - as is standard, if it was editorially justified on the night it would be reflected.

'In line with previous years presenters and artists will be reminded that the BBC Proms is a music event not a political platform.'

Ben Bradshaw, the former Culture Secretary, urged the BBC to publish information about the future of the licence fee before the referendum vote.

'The future of the BBC in Scotland and the level of the licence fee was raised with me on the doorstep when I was campaigning in Scotland this week,' he told the Guardian.

'If Scots wish to keep a Scottish BBC or something like it in the event of independence, they will lose the BBC's economy of scale and will face paying much more if they wish to keep quality public service broadcasting.'

A BBC source told MailOnline that there had been no attempts to supress any internal reports, adding that the Corporation had made no decisions on the future of the licence fee.

The BBC's incoming chairman Rona Fairhead told MPs this week that it was right to delay plans for the future until after the referendum vote, in order to remain impartial during the independence campaign.

A spokesman said: 'As we have consistently stated we have done no planning about the future of BBC services after the referendum, including any calculations about the level of a licence fee.'

As well as questions over the licence fee, a 'Yes' vote in the referendum could cast doubt over the future of BBC programmes which are produced in Scotland.

Mrs Brown's Boys, starring Irish comedian Brendan O'Carroll, is filmed in a studio in Glasgow, and Question Time's producers are based in Scotland although the programme moves around the UK for each episode.

Other popular programmes produced by BBC Scotland have included school drama Waterloo Road and detective series Wallander.

Last month, Scottish TV producers spoke out against the BBC's refusal to plan for the future, saying it could leave the creative arts industry in limbo for up to two years.

A spokesman for Better Together, the anti-independence campaign group, said the uncertainty over the BBC could jeopardise the 'good deal' currently enjoyed by Scottish audiences.

'The BBC is one of the most respected national institutions we have and people in Scotland don't support Alex Salmond's plan to break it up,' he said.

'Licence fee payers in Scotland contribute around £320million a year but we benefit from programming and production worth £3.6billion. That's a good deal for Scotland.'

But Blair Jenkins, chief executive of Yes Scotland, said: 'The current Scottish Government has made it absolutely clear that the licence fee payable in Scotland at the point of independence will be the same as the rest of the UK.

'In an independent Scotland, viewers will continue to receive the programmes and channels currently enjoyed, but with significantly more programmes being commissioned and produced in Scotland.'
