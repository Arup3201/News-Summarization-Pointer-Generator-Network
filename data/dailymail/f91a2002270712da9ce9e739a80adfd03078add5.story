A set of identical twins have released a brutally honest video chronicling how they lost a combined 16st.

YouTubers Niki and Sammy Albon, both 22, piled on the pounds in their teenage years after becoming 'addicted' to snacking between meals.

Niki shot to 18st while Sammy peaked at a hefty 21st 2lb. It wasn’t until they started university that they started to slim down and within just 18 months, the boys had cut their weight by more than a third.

Niki, who is the eldest of the brothers by 18 minutes, said: 'I think if you’re overweight you think a lot more about things. For example we would never be confident going on a public transport.

'You are always worried about what you look like and what people are thinking.

'We used to eat snacks all the time but our meals were just a normal size.

'Then we started cooking our own food so we knew what we were putting in it. Then the weight just started falling off.

'We just felt compelled to make the weight loss videos because we had been through it yourself and wanted to help other people.

'We had a really good reaction to it and it’s nice that it has gone down so well with everybody.'

Weightloss journey: Niki explained that they used to eat snacks all the time but their meals were just a normal size and once they moved to university, they took control of their weight

Niki said the pair only started losing weight midway through university when they were forced to budget and had to cut out takeaways and snacks.

In the video the pair tell their viewers they are not alone, reassuring them it is 'how you feel inside that counts'.

Sammy, a part-time librarian, says he and Nikki were delighted the video had reached so many people.

He added: 'We aren’t bothered about being on TV we just want to make our channel as successful as possible and then that will open other things up to us.

'Our videos are supposed to funny and there isn’t really supposed to be a serious message behind them.

'Out of 200 odd videos only two are about weight loss so that’s not what the channel is about.

'We just felt like doing a video about our weight loss was important as it was such a massive part of our lives.'

Career: Sammy, left, and Niki spent more than £1,000 on filming equipment and now it is so successful that they earn enough money to keep the site going alongside their part-time jobs

Niki added: 'Me and Sammy are like best enemies, we argue a lot but yeah I would say we’re still best friends.

'It is good company having each other. It is almost as if you’re just hanging out with yourself.'

The pair spent more than £1,000 on filming equipment and now it is so successful that they earn enough money to keep the site going alongside their part-time jobs.

The boys live at home with their mother Jacqueline, 48, a hairdresser and their father, mechanic Darren, 47, in Canvey Island, Essex.
