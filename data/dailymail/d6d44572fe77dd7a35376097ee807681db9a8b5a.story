His slick black hair and boyish looks sent female fans around the world into a frenzy.

So as music lovers around the world celebrated what would have been Elvis Presley's 80th birthday this week - an image was released showing what he may have looked like now.

Photo specialists Phojoe.com created an age progression photo of the King of Rock and Roll - with graying hair and wrinkles. 

King of Rock and Roll: Image specialists Phojoe.com studied 50 photos of Elvis Presley to put together a picture of what he would have looked like on his 80th birthday last Thursday 

The company is regularly used by local law enforcement, media, and occasionally the FBI to put together images of how suspects or people of interest may look years down the line.

They studied about 50 photos of Elvis and used them as reference to come up with the image predicting how the rock and roll icon would look now. 

Presley was born in poverty in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 8, 1935, and as a teen moved to Memphis with his parents and absorbed the mixture of blues, rhythm and blues, and African-American gospel from which rock music emerged.

He moved to Memphis with his parents at age 13. He died on August 16, 1977 in Memphis at the age of 42.

Several hundred fans braved freezing cold on Thursday to join Elvis Presley's family in Memphis, Tennessee on what would have been the King of Rock 'n' Roll's 80th birthday.

Cheers went up as Presley's former wife Priscilla and their only child Lisa Marie, along with Elvis' grandchildren, sliced an eight-tier cake frozen by the 16F temperature, then sang happy birthday to the king.

Fans got a chance to get a bite of the cake at a diner across the street from Graceland, the Presley residence that has become a shrine to his life, work and rich musical legacy.

In a ceremony held at Graceland this morning, January 8 was declared to be Elvis Presley Day in Memphis, Tennessee. 

An American pop culture icon like few others, Presley rode high in the rock music charts in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s before his untimely death.

His legacy includes 108 songs on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 pop music chart as well as 129 records in the Billboard 200 album chart - most recently in 2002 with a greatest hits set.

'He has stayed on top all these years,' said Scotty Moore, 83, of Nashville, the guitarist and last man standing from the recording session that yielded the 1954 hit That's All Right.

Other birthday events on Thursday include an auction of authenticated Elvis memorabilia including his first driver's license and the jacket he wore in the movie 'Viva Las Vegas.'

Also up for grabs is the first recording Presley ever made - an acetate disc from Sun Studios on which he sang the 1940s chestnut 'My Happiness' for his mother. He was 18 at the time. 

Celebration: Presley's former wife Priscilla was at the singer's Graceland estate on Thursday for what would have been his birthday - cutting a huge cake in his honor in front of a crowd
