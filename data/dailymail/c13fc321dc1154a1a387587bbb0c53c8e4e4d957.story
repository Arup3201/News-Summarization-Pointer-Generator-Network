A toy penguin featured in the John Lewis Christmas Advert is already being sold on eBay for up to £500 - just one day after the commercial was released.

Monty the Penguin, the star of this year's festive advert, flew off shelves and sold out online within hours of his screen debut yesterday, with parents forking out £95 for the cuddly toy.

And many of those quick enough to buy Monty or his love interest, Mabel, are taking advantage of the penguins' popularity - by selling them online for more than three times the original price.

Within hours of selling out on the John Lewis website, Monty and Mabel the penguins were listed on eBay for as much as £499 

Monty the penguin stars alongside actor Rhys Edwards, who plays Sam, in the heart warming advert 

This year's two-minute festive commercial tells the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by seven-year-old Rhys Edwards, and his friend Monty.

The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel.

Throughout the advert Monty is a CGI penguin, but at the end it is revealed to be a stuffed toy - and for a few hours you could buy him and his girlfriend online in various sizes for between £12 and £95.

Within hours the toys, which come in three sizes, had completely sold out online along with penguin-patterned pyjamas and cuff links. 

Variations of Monty and Mabel then began appearing online, with one eBay user charging an astonishing £499 for the pair. 

Others listed a pair of 35cm toys for £124, some £50 more than in stores.

But, with more stock expected to become available today, a spokesman for John Lewis said customers eager to get their hands on a version of the toy need not worry. 

A set of the 25cm penguin - which costs £35 in stores - was being sold for more than double the price online 

Another medium sized penguin was listed online for double the original price after the retailer sold out online 

Within hours of the advert being released yesterday John Lewis sold out online. The retailer hopes to have more stock available today 

'The advert has proved very popular, as it always does. 

'Hopefully we will get more stock out today for customers to order online. Monty and Mabel have not sold out in stores however,' a spokesman told MailOnline this morning. 

But while online shoppers clambered over their keyboards to buy the toy, those in stores were not convinced of its steep price tag. 

Dedi Chinanurakchart, a 21-year-old student in the Oxford Street store said: 'If it was a real penguin I probably would have bought it because I've always wanted one. 

'Why is it so pricey? Is it stuffed with gold?'

Malik Kydd, 19, also complained about the price: 'If that's the thing that they are promoting in the advert it shouldn't cost so much - because John Lewis is (usually) an accessible store for everybody.'

Similarly, Daneika March, 24, and Natalie Baker, 38, who work at House of Fraser, enjoyed the family-focused feel to the ad, but Ms Baker said she would not be swayed by the £95 Monty toy.

In the advert , a live penguin plays the role of Sam's best friend and sidekick in the boy's London home 

After looking for love, Monty is given the best Christmas gift he could have hoped for when Sam brings him a female penguin 

At the end of the two minute commercial it's revealed that Sam had been playing with a cuddly toy and not, as portrayed, a live penguin 

'I think it's £9.50 for a bear in John Lewis at the moment, so I wouldn't buy a £95 Monty.' 

Every year merchandise linked to the department store's seasonal advert has sold out within days of the hotly-anticipated commercial's release. 

Last year's theme, which featured The Hare and the Bear to a soundtrack of Lily Allen singing Keane's Somewhere Only We Know, saw alarm clocks and cuddly toys also pop up on eBay for more than double their original price. 

And in 2010, Ellie Goulding's Your Song racked up tens of millions of views after being played in the retailer's seasonal advert. Her rendition was so popular, it was chosen as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their first dance after wedding in 2011.
