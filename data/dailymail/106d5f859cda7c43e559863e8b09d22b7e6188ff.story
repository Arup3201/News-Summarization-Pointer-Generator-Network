It can be one of the big problems of any day on the beach.

It’s a hot afternoon and you want to go for a splash in the sea. But what do you do about the valuables that you have scattered next to your lounger?

Do you leave them lying on a towel in 
the belief that your cash and keys 
will still be there when you get back from frolicking in the waves?

Not so fast, Mr Thief: The device conceals beach valuables from prying eyes

Or do you play it safe and abandon the idea of a swim, sweltering on the sand while everyone else goes and does the cooling-off thing in the shallows?

Holidaymakers frustrated by the above 
options – or lack of them – may be intrigued by the clever new device 
which protects your essential items during a sunbathing session.

‘Tansafe’ 
looks like a standard bottle of suncream – but is, in fact, a crafty 
carry case capable of holding the things you would least like to lose 
while you head off for a dip.

Sleight of hand: The device protects beach-goers from theft by masquerading as a bottle of lotion

To all intents and purposes: The device maintains its disguise at first, second and third glance

It can store keys, cash and credit cards – and is also big enough to hide an iPhone, Blackberry or other mobile phone.

It is also small enough to be easily portable, measuring 16.5cm by 6.7cm by 2.7cm.

It works via a simple visual trick.

It looks, to first, second and third glances, like the sort of mundane plastic container found in every travel bag – rather than a potential treasure trove for thieves.

The lid is also water-tight, ensuring that disaster will be averted if you drop it in the sea.

Online retailer Firebox, which sells the product for £7.99, describes it as ‘an essential travelling companion for canny sunbathers everywhere’.
