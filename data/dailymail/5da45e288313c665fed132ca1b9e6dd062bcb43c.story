A 'hot selfie' competition where posers paid to enter in the hope of winning $10,000 has been shut down before a winner could be chosen.

The narcissistic photography challenge was abandoned after ‘entrant tampering’, according to the competition’s website.

Selfie snappers, including cast members from Australia's production of musical Grease, Gretel Scarlett and Bobby Fox - who recently recorded a song with model Miranda Kerr, paid $4.99 to enter one selfie or $9.99 to enter three photos.

A statement on the Hot Selfie website said: ‘It was with regret that Serious Selfies PTY. LTD. terminated the Hot Selfie Competition, ahead of its end date, as a result of entrant tampering.

‘Unfortunately, one of our entrants had been contacted and intimidated outside of the Facebook platform.’

Brisbane-based company Serious Selfie offered a $10,000 cash prize for the best pout

Brisbane-based company Serious Selfie set up the competition which offered a cash prize for the best pout.

In a statement, the organisation - which specialises in 'online photographic competitions' - said it wanted to open 'the field for all Australians to boost their profile... all for doing what most of do regularly any way - a selfie'.

The competition was based on popularity - the person who gets the most likes on Facebook wins.

However, the Facebook page no longer exists.

The company said it has refunded money to entrants and also donated money to charities.

The competition has now been shut down and the money refunded to entrants 

‘Entry fees were refunded. We thank all entrants for participating. We are disappointed that the competition has closed in this manner,’ a statement said. Serious Selfies donated $1500 each to Royal Perth Hospital – Intensive Care Unit, Greyhound New Beginnings, and the Stillbirth Foundation Australia.
