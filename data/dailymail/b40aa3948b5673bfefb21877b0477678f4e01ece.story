An Icelandic brewery is launching a beer containing dead fin whales, claiming it is a ‘healthy low-fat alternative’.

Brugghús Steðja has teamed up with whaling company Hvalur to launch the 5.2% beer, produced in time for the Icelandic mid-winter festival.

Environmentalist groups are outraged as they believe the beer poses a threat to the endangered fin whale.

The conservation group's Icelandic 
whaling campaign leader Vanessa Williams-Grey said: ‘Demand for this 
meat is in decline, with fewer and fewer people eating it.

‘Even
 so, reducing a beautiful, sentient whale to an ingredient on the side 
of a beer bottle is about as immoral and outrageous as it is possible to
 get.

‘The brewery may 
claim that this is just a novelty product with a short shelf life, but 
what price the life of an endangered whale which might have lived to be 
90 years?’

Its launch is 
timed to coincide with the Icelandic mid-winter festival of Torrablst 
(Thorrablot) held in honour of the Norse god, Thor.

Brewery
 owner, Dabjartur Arilmusson, declared: ‘This is a unique beer, brewed 
in collaboration with Hvalur. Whale beer will include, among other 
things, whale meal.’

Fitness first: Whale meal is a byproduct of commercial processing of whales and makes for 'a healthy drink' according to the microbrewery, as it is high in protein (file photo)

The brewery also states that the beer is a healthy drink because ‘whale meal is very protein rich, and has almost no fat in it.’

‘That,
 along with the fact that no sugar is added makes this a very healthful 
drink, and people will be true Vikings drinking it.’

Asked
 if he was concerned that the product would fall foul of anti-whalers, 
he commented: ‘Doubtless some people won't like it, there is a certain 
risk and we are aware of that, but we hope Icelanders will like it as 
we're naturally addressing it to Thorrablot, when people eat and drink 
various things which they normally wouldn't.’

Last
 year, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation helped expose the use of 
endangered fin whales in dog food, and the use of fuel made from dead 
fin whales to power Hvalur's own hunting vessels.
