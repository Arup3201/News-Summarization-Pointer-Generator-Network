The deputy leader of Golden Dawn was today on the run as five MPs from Greece's extreme-right party were charged with being part of a criminal group with intent to commit crimes.

Christos Pappas remains at large but leader Nikos Michaloliakos, party spokesman Ilias Kassidiaris and Yannis Lagos, Nikos Michos and Ilias Panayiotaros were arrested by counter-terrorism police.  

‘Nothing can scare us!’ shouted a handcuffed Mr Kasidiaris early yesterday morning, as he was transferred to the prosecutors' office flanked by hooded police officers carrying machine-guns.

It was the first time since 1974 that 
sitting members of parliament in the troubled country have been 
arrested, underlining the Greek Government's efforts to stifle the 
fiercely anti-immigrant party.

Another
15 people, including 13 party members and two police officers, have 
also been arrested and are due to appear before a prosecutor and an 
examining magistrate. They face the same charges.

‘It
is an unprecedentedly dynamic response to a neo-Nazi organisation,’ a 
government spokesman said, hinting the arrests were in an effort to deal
with the party as a criminal, not a political force.

‘The
Prime Minister and the Government were determined to deal with Golden 
Dawn solely through the justice system,’ spokesman Simos Kedikoglou 
said.

‘We have succeeded in 
stripping them of their political cover and deal with them as what they 
really are, a criminal organisation.’

Citizen protection minister Nikos Dendias compared Golden Dawn members to German SS squads.

‘The state has proven it is not 
helpless in the face of organised violence... Greek society will not 
tolerate any storm troopers,’ Mr Dendias said.

The Government ordered an investigation 
into Golden Dawn's activities after the death of rapper Pavlos Fyssas on
September 18 sparked outrage across Greece.

The suspect arrested over his 
death admitted to police that he had stabbed the 34-year-old and 
identified himself as a supporter of Golden Dawn.

Police investigated his mobile phone records and those of more than 300 people connected to Golden Dawn.

Investigations
have extended to the police, who have been accused in the past of 
turning a blind eye to Golden Dawn violence and of mistreating 
immigrants.

Under existing 
anti-terrorism legislation, membership in a criminal organisation is a 
flagrant crime for which the Golden Dawn deputies can be prosecuted 
without Parliament needing to lift their immunity.

Despite the arrests, the party's MPs retain their parliamentary seats unless they are convicted of a crime. Golden Dawn holds 18 of parliament's 300 seats, after winning nearly 7 per cent of the vote in general elections last year.

The party has vehemently denied any role in the killing, but it has appeared to dent Golden Dawn's appeal among Greeks.

As calls for a crackdown mounted, the party hinted its parliamentarians might resign to provoke elections in 15 multi-party constituencies.

‘There will be no elections, certainly no general elections,’ Mr Kedikoglou said. Asked about the likelihood of partial elections if Golden Dawn deputies were to resign, he said ‘there are ways to deal with that, as well’.
