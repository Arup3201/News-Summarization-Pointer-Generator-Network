After the stellar success of her lingerie range with Marks and Spencer, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has now branched out into nightwear.

The supermodel is hoping to help women get their beauty sleep in style with her luxurious new range of cashmere capes, silk dressing gowns and soft snoods.

The 26-year-old, who hails from Devon, was in store this morning to unveil her new collection for Autograph.

She's back! After a successful lingerie collaboration with M&S, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has unveiled a sleepwear range with the high-street store

She stayed loyal to the High Street mecca by donning a £299 fitted animal-print leather skirt from one of their ranges, which she teamed with a classic black top and sophisticated black court shoes.

The sleep range features a £149 pure cashmere jumper with detachable snood, as well as satin reverse pyjamas, which come with a more reasonable price-tag of £35.

In August, Rosie celebrated her one year anniversary as a designer with the high-street store.

She celebrated by releasing an Autumn 13 collection of sophisticated and luxurious underwear pieces.

Speaking
at the time, she said: 'I can’t quite believe it’s been a whole year 
since the Rosie for Autograph launch, it’s gone so fast!'.

It has been a busy month for the model, who shot to fame in the Transformers films.

She recently took to the catwalk 
make-up free at the Balmain show during Paris Fashion Week and was spotted 
landing at LAX airport in the U.S. on Sunday morning.

In her spare time, Rosie has 
been working 
extensively with personal trainer James Duigan- creator of the Bodyism 
system and bestselling author of The Clean and Lean diet - in order to 
keep her body
in perfect shape.

But
while Rosie clearly enjoys a work out, Duigan, who has also worked with 
Elle Macpherson and Nigella Lawson, maintains her strict diet is one
of the reasons she’s able to maintain her incredible figure.

‘Rosie makes a mean guacamole which 
is a filling and nutrient dense snack,’ he told news.com. ‘About half an
avocado a day is the perfect way to include fat-fighting in your diet.’

But despite eating healthily, Devon-born Rosie admits she isn't a fan of fad diets.

Speaking
to Vogue, she said: ‘I’m not really one for fad diets, I like to keep 
things simple. I grew up on a farm, so if I want to detox or shed some 
weight or eat cleanly I’ll cut out carbs and refined sugars. So that’s 
my tip for eating well: Nothing extreme.’ 

The British star admits to 
being a huge fan of physical exercise and does her best to squeeze her 
work-outs in as often as possible.

Happy to be here: Rosie is extremely passionate about her lingerie range with M&S and spends hours perfecting every piece that goes on sale

‘I
love exercise,’ she said.  ‘For me, all my confidence starts there – 
with my exercise. It’s not just about being in shape, it also improves 
my well-being.

‘I feel better about myself, it boosts my confidence. And that for me is where the beauty regime starts, in the gym.’

Rosie also criticised
the fashion industry's lack of guidance for young models, revealing an 
agent once told her to eat 'a single piece of sushi a day'.

In a recent interview with The Observer newspaper talking about her early career in modelling she
said: 'I felt that there was never anything for me, no workshops, no 
people letting you know how you should be eating or what you should be 
wearing to castings.'

Secret behind that physique: Rosie has been working extensively with personal trainer James Duigan- creator of the Bodyism system and bestselling author of The Clean and Lean diet - in order to keep her body in perfect shape
