Two spurned women who went online to warn other woman to stay well away from a Lothario had the case against them thrown out in court today.

Former roller-derby queen Stacey Blitsch and Amanda Ryncarz celebrated the victory at a Los Angeles news conference today over their lover, Matthew Couloute Jr.

The two women originally made a website saying that Couloute was a no-good Lothario and dumped Miss Ryncarz over the phone a week before marrying someone else.

Done and out: Attorney Matthew Couloute's case was thrown out by a judge who said that the two women are entitled to their opinions

Attorney Matthew Couloutte Jr. claims the two women posted defamatory insults about him on a website.

One anonymous post claimed: 'Our relationship didn't last long, as I figured him out pretty quickly, but for others, BE FOREWARNED, HE'S SCUM! RUN FAR AWAY!'

Miss Blitsch, who has a son with the lawyer, claims she did not write any posts, while Miss Ryncarz argues her comments were truthful and should be covered by free speech.

'I do believe that women should have a legal right to share information with each other, if they feel they have been betrayed in a relationship,' she said.

Celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred represented the two women and told the New York Post: ‘Given the fact that legislatures and courts do not protect women against liars and cheaters, women helping women by warning them may be the only means by which women can protect themselves.’

In his lawsuit, Couloute claimed the former roller jam television star and Ms Ryncarz have cost him clients and nearly cost him his dream home after their post on LiarsCheatersRUs.com landed at the top of Google when searching his name.

The judge overseeing the case said Couloute failed to prove the women were using their words to poison clients against him.

He also refused to let Couloute revise his suit to include charges of defamation.

‘The average reader would know that the comments are “emotionally charged rhetoric” and the “opinions of disappointed lovers,”’ Judge Harold Baer wrote.

The Post reported that Couloute intends to appeal the ruling.

Mr Couloute, in a video interview with
Fox News, said he was filing suit against the women for 'tortuous 
interference with prospective business relations'.

The cheating website, which ranks first during a Google search of his name, includes a series of anonymous posts.

One claims: ‘He is 
very, very manipulating, he's an attorney so he's great at lying and 
covering it up without batting an eye'

Mr Couloute told the network: 'It’s unfortunate... Anyone can slander someone anonymously and just get away with it.'

'[They] don’t have the right to defame people on the Internet,' he continued.

Ms Blitsch, 35, who has a son with the
lawyer, claims she did not write any posts, while Ms Ryncarz, 26, has 
argued her comments were truthful and should be covered by free speech.

‘I posted on Liarscheatersrus.com 
because I wanted to warn other women in order to protect them from what I
suffered,’ Ms Ryncarz said in a statement issued last September.

'I do believe that women should have a
legal right to share information with each other, if they feel they 
have been betrayed in a relationship,' she continued.
