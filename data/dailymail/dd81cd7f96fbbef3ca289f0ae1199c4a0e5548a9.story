Bedroom antics and risqué lingerie might not be the first things that come to mind which you think of the city of Norwich.

Famed for its historical architecture and surrounding countryside, the East Anglian town is apparently hiding a more saucy side.

The city’s 44-55 year-old women buy more erotic lingerie than any other in the UK.

Both Jane Fonda, 74, left, and Kim Cattrall, 57, say that their sex lives have improved as they've got older

The survey, which looked at the spending habits on erotic lingerie of women aged 45-55 across the UK, found that Sheffield came second to Norwich for lingerie sales, followed by Manchester in third.

The lowest spending towns were found to be Milton Keynes, Inverness and Woking.

A more liberated sexual attitude in recent years and the popularity of erotic fiction like Fifty Shades of Grey is thought to be behind the trend for women over 40 becoming more sexually assertive.

Hit TV shows such as Cougar Town and Sex And The City have also shown a more liberated side to older women and encouraged women to celebrate their sexual side, resulting in a boom in lingerie sales by women in this age range.

Last year, 74-year-old Jane Fonda revealed she was having the 'best sex' of her life with long term partner Richard Perry, who is four years younger than her.

She said at the time: ‘At 74, I have never had such a fulfilling sex life.

When I was young I had so many inhibitions - I didn't know what I desired.’

Kim Cattrall, 57, who played seductress Samantha Jones in Sex and the City, also championed embracing sex regardless of your age.

The actress said she enjoyed making love more after she reached the age of 40, particularly with younger men.

She said earlier this year: ‘I enjoyed my best sex life after the age of 40, I lost my virginity at the age of 15 and thought, 'is that it'?

She added: ‘I like the fact I have saved my best years for last.’

According to recent surveys, over 50s are having more sex than they were six years ago.

A third of the age group said they enjoyed sex more than in their youth and four in five of those in their early 50s made love regularly.

Emily Bendell, founder of Bluebella, who conducted the survey, said:

‘Older women really know who they are and what they like – and nothing is more enticing and attractive than that inner confidence. As taboos lift, more and more women are now dating men years younger than her and naturally she wants to look as alluring as she can.

‘Female celebrities such as Jane Fonda and Kim Cattrall have been unashamed to admit their sex life improved in later life and it's inspiring to an older generation who are not content to kiss goodbye to their sex lives after children or grandchildren!

‘And let's not forget the hit TV show Cougar Town starring Courtney Cox who is seen parading around in her underwear and looks beautiful.

‘Our statistics are proof that older women not only want to prolong their sex lives, but they want to enjoy them too - with their husbands, boyfriends or perhaps a toyboy.’

Emily added: ‘Feedback tells us our underwear empowers women of any age.

‘Of course, women are gaining more power generally so that means they have confidence to take control in all aspects of their lives and set the rules, including those in the bedroom and men like to see an inner dominatrix unleashed. 

‘There must be some very happy husbands and boyfriends in Norwich.’
