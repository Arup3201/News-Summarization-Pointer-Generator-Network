A tiny baby, wrapped in a blanket is freed from the remains of its home after a horrific air strike carried out by forces loyal to the Syrian leader.

Children, their faces covered in thick dust mixed with their own tears, were hauled from the wreckage following the latest bomb attack on Damascus, in which a number of civilians were killed.

Witnesses said they had seen military helicopters dropping devastating 'barrel bombs' on residential areas in the Douma district of the city.

Men formed a human chain to remove the children from the rubble, as the terrified youngsters cried out in fear, many of them barefoot, their clothes blackened and torn in the blast.

Rescue: A man carries a tiny baby, wrapped in a blanket, from the wreckage of its home after what activists say was an airstrike by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad

Innocent: The tiny infant, dressed in a blue baby-grow appeared to have survived the air strike unharmed

Saved: The baby is lifted high above the heads of rescuers as other children are also carried to safety

Other rescue workers carried the youngsters high above their heads as they desperately tried to carry them to safety.

The strike, which activists say was carried out by forces loyal to Presiden Bashar Assad, came as the first batch of the most dangerous chemicals in Syria's arsenal were removed from the country after the leader bowed to pressure to hand them over.

The chemicals were loaded onto a Danish ship and taken out of the country yesterday under tight security, an important milestone in the international operation to rid President Assad of the weapons by the middle of the year.

The operation at Syria's port of Latakia took place against the backdrop of a widening civil war and escalating infighting between a chaotic mix of Syrian rebel brigades and an al-Qaida linked militant group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

Terror: Men held an injured boy, whose dust-coated face is streaked with his own tears

Horror: A man desperately tries to take the child to safety

With the rebel-on-rebel fighting now in its fifth day, the shadowy leader of another faction affiliated with al-Qaida pleaded with his comrades to stop the spreading clashes, warning it threatened to upend gains made against Syrian government forces.

The chemicals were supposed to have been removed from Syria by December 31, but poor security, bad weather and other factors meant the deadline was missed by a week.

The raw materials - precursor chemicals for poison gas - were moved to the government-held port of Latakia from two sites in Syria and loaded onto the Danish cargo ship, which then set sail, said Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch diplomat coordinating the joint mission by the UN and Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

'The vessel has now left the port of Latakia for international waters,' Kaag said in a statement. 'It will remain at sea awaiting the arrival of additional priority chemical materials at the port.'

Security for the highly toxic cargo is being provided by warships from Russia, China, Denmark and Norway.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the progress.

The chemicals will eventually be transferred to a US ship, the Cape Ray, which has been fitted with special machinery. Once aboard the American vessel, the materials will be placed in a titanium reactor that uses heated water and other chemicals to render the weapons inert.

Fear: The little boy cries as he is carried by his determined rescuers

Heroic: Men formed a human chain to remove the children from the rubble, as the terrified youngsters cried out in fear

Pressure: The strike came as the first batch of the most dangerous chemicals in Syria's arsenal were removed from the country after the leader bowed to pressure to hand them over

The confirmed use of chemical weapons in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta on August 21, killed hundreds of people, according to the US government. The US and Russia - a staunch ally of Syria - later reached agreement to eliminate the Assad regime's chemical weapons by mid-2014 in a deal that averted US military strikes against Syria.

The infighting between rebel groups is concentrated in parts of northern Syria, spreading Monday to the northeastern city of Raqqa, a bastion of the al-Qaida-linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

The group has alienated its opposition rivals, including the extremist Jabhat al-Nusra, for its extremely brutal tactics, including the kidnapping and killing of opponents, journalists and anti-government activists who criticize its practices. Moderate forces among the opposition accuse the group of tarnishing the Syrian revolution and serving Assad's interests.

Devastation: The war, now in its third year, has killed more than 130,000 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Right, which keeps track of the fighting

'The (Assad) regime will revive itself after it was close to disappearing,' said Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the head of Jabhat al-Nusra. His comments in a rare audio recording posted on a militant website underscored the seriousness of the clashes.

The rising influence of al-Qaida extremists among rebel ranks has dampened U.S. support for the rebellion, and rebel infighting is further undermining the fight against Assad. The war, now in its third year, has killed more than 130,000 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Right, which keeps track of the fighting.

The UN's human rights office said it has stopped updating the death toll from the civil war, confirming it can no longer verify the sources of information that led to its last count of at least 100,000 in July 2013.

Destruction: Another strike in the Haydariyeh quarter of Aleppo killed at least six civilians

The rebel infighting adds another hardship to an already-suffering population.

The
 Syrian Observatory and another group, the Aleppo Media Center, said a 
government airstrike killed at least 10 people, including children, in 
the northern town of Bzaa. Another strike in the Haydariyeh quarter of 
Aleppo killed at least six civilians. They said the strikes came Monday.

In the recording, 
al-Golani pleaded for an end to infighting, but suggested the Islamic 
State of Iraq and the Levant brought it on itself.

'The mistaken policies that (the group) practiced had a big role to play in igniting this conflict,' al-Golani said.

He added they were trying to form an independent council to halt the fighting 'to save the battlefields from being lost.'
