Managing director Graham Mackereth and electrical engineer Paul Keddie have been cleared of health and safety breaches after Alan Catterall (above) was burnt to death at a factory in Runcorn,  Cheshire

Two businessman on trial over the death of a worker who was accidentally trapped inside an industrial oven by his future son-on-law have had the case against them dropped – but their company still faces corporate manslaughter charges.

Managing director Graham Mackereth and electrical engineer Paul Keddie have been cleared of breaching health and safety regulations after father-of-three Alan Catterall, 54, was burnt to death at a kayak factory in Runcorn, Cheshire.

Mr Catterall, a grandfather, had gone into the oven to fix a fault when operator Mark Francis, not realising he was still working inside, switched the machine on and locked him in.

Mr Francis was engaged to Mr Catterall's eldest daughter.

A judge at Liverpool Crown Court today agreed there was no case to answer against Mr Keddie and Mr Mackereth, 64, and the pair were discharged from court.

However, their company Pyranha Mouldings continues to face a corporate manslaughter charge and oven designer Peter Mackereth, 59, from Llangollen, Wales, faces a charge of breaching health and safety laws.

The court heard today that prosecuting QC Andrew Thomas had conceded  the evidence against Graham Mackereth was insufficient for a conviction.

He opposed the application involving Mr Keddie, who designed the electrics and electronic systems for the oven, but the judge, Mr Justice Macduff, ruled there was no case to answer.

He said that Mr Keddie had designed the systems for the oven according to Pyranha's brief and therefore couldn't be held accountable for how they were used.

The judge added: 'There is no evidence that any danger was due to his undertaking'.

During the trial, which began almost a month ago, the court heard how no one had realised Mr Catterall was inside the oven on December 23, 2010, until smoke started seeping out and the 'horrific' circumstances of his death were discovered.

A jury heard how the huge oven had been switched off for an hour after a fault developed and, after it was fixed, it was switched on by Mr Francis.

As it was switched on, the doors automatically shut and locked with metal pins which dropped into place on the outside.

Mr Catterall was trapped within the oven with no means of escape and no means of raising the alarm.

Mr Thomas told jurors: 'After a preparation cycle lasting several minutes, the burners were turned on and the oven was raised to operating temperature.

'The evidence indicates that Mr Catterall made efforts to escape using a metal crowbar but it was to no avail. He suffered severe burns and died as a result of shock.

'The first anyone knew about the problem was when smoke started seeping out of the oven.'

Rotational moulding expert Dr Paul Nugent gave evidence at yesterday's court hearing after inspecting the company's machines.

He told the court that there weren't 'any of these machines in the world which have safety exit panels or any means of exit from inside.'

An investigation by Cheshire Police and the Health and Safety Executive found the oven had been designed by Pyranha Mouldings and said the company was responsible for safety.

The prosecutor alleged today that investigations later found there was no written procedure of any kind, no manual of operation, no written training record and no warning sign at the factory.

Mr Catterall grew up in Liverpool and worked at a tyre factory in Speke before joining the Ford factory in Halewood where he worked for many years.

He joined Pyranha in 1997 and was promoted to team leader at the company, which had between 90 and 100 employees including his wife of 34 years and daughter.

The case continues.
