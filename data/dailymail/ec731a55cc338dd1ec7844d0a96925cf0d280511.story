The trial of a former lifeguard accused of killing schoolgirl April Jones may last seven weeks, a court heard today.

Mark Bridger, 47, was arrested the day after five-year-old April vanished while playing on her bike near her home in Machynlleth, mid-Wales last year.

His murder trial, which will start later this week, is expected to last until mid June.

Bridger, wearing a short-sleeved light blue shirt and striped tie, spoke only to confirm his name as he stood in the dock at Mold Crown Court.

Suspect: Mark Bridger, who is accused of murdering April Jones, arrives at Mold Crown Court today under a blanket for the start of his trial

Anguish: April's parents Paul and Coral Jones arrive at the court today for the start of the case. They daughter has never been found after vanishing on October 1 last year

The defendant, who could be seen with a large tattoo on his left forearm, was flanked by two security guards as around 50 potential jurors were brought into the court room.

Trial judge Mr Justice Griffith Williams told them: 'I don’t know whether you have been reading the papers or listening to the news but if you have, you have probably worked out by now that I am about to start the trial which arises out of the alleged murder of April Jones in Machynlleth last October.'

He added: 'The defendant’s name is Mark Bridger, he is obviously sitting in the dock. It may be as well that you have a look at him just to make sure he is not somebody who you know or who you think you know.'

The youngster’s body has never been found despite a major operation led by Dyfed Powys Police after her disappearance on October 1 last year.

Accused: Mark Bridger, right, is charged with murdering April Jones, five, who vanished last October. His trial is scheduled to start later this week and will last until mid June

During the initial stages of the jury selection process, prospective members of the panel were read a list of more than 50 witnesses who are due to give evidence.

The pool of potential jurors was also informed that the jury in the case will pay a visit to various sites in the Machynlleth area during the trial.

Asking the jury pool to consider any connections to Machynlleth which may prevent them from sitting on the jury, the trial judge added: 'It is very important that no person on the jury has any present or past connection with the Machynlleth area, and certainly no connection which would cause any concern about that particular juror sitting on the case.'

Trial: April Jones' family enter the court building today as a panel of potential jurors was selected. Mark Bridger will go on trial later this week

The disappearance of April, who had 
cerebral palsy, sparked a massive outpouring of support for her family, 
with hundreds of people joining the search.

Bridger, of Ceinws, is charged with abducting and murdering April, and of unlawfully disposing of and concealing her body with intent to pervert the course of justice.

He pleaded not guilty to the allegations on January 14 at Mold Crown Court.

The trial is expected to be occupied with legal matters and jury selection today and is due to open later this week.

A pool of 30 possible jurors was sent 
home later and asked to return tomorrow for the final 12-member panel to
be selected and sworn in.

Missing:

Hunt: Despite an extensive search operation, police have never found April Jones

Hearing: The case at Mold Crown Court is due to last until mid-June. Today a panel of 50 potential jurors was selected which will be whittled down to a final 12 who will hear the case
