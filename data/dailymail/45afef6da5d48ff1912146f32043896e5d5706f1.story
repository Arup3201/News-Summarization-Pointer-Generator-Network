A man who punched an announcer dubbed 'the voice of the Millennium Stadium' so hard he was left fighting for his life has today been jailed.

Onlookers described an 'awful crack' as actor Rhys ap William hit the floor during the street corner attack after Wales celebrated the Six Nations win over Italy.

The Welsh TV actor had accidentally collided with Martin Frampton as he was walking along the street.

Cardiff Crown Court heard before Frampton, 24,then  'whacked' the actor, 37, who did not defend himself.

Prosecutor Julian Greenwood said: 'He went down like a ninepin and hit the back of his head on the kerb or the road surface.

'He fractured his skull and had bruising and bleeding to the brain and later suffered two seizures.'

Mr ap William hit the ground so hard that the landlady of the nearby Admiral Napier pub described an 'awful crack'.

The announcer was treated for his severe injuries in Cardiff’s University Hospital’s High Dependency Unit before being transferred to a neurosurgical ward.

Cardiff Crown Court heard he made a slow and steady recovery before being discharged.

Judge Stephen Hopkins jailed Frampton, from Ely, Cardiff, for 12 months after he pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm.

The judge said: 'The victim was hit so hard that he went down like a sack of potatoes and was rendered unconscious before he hit the ground.

'His injuries were life-threatening.'
