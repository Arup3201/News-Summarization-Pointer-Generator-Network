Andy Murray has avoided clear favourite Novak Djokovic in the group stages for next week’s season-end finale at London’s O2 Arena.

The 27 year-old Scot, promoted to world No 6 in Monday's new rankings, was instead put in a group with Roger Federer, Kei Nishikori and big-hitting Canadian Milos Raonic for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.

Anyone would have wanted to be kept away from Djokovic on last week’s form in Paris, where he won every match in straight sets en route to the title, and Murray is certainly no different having now lost to him on seven of their previous eight meetings.

With the season’s eight top players on show – minus Rafael Nadal, who is having appendix surgery – neither group was ever going to be much easier than the other but Djokovic is certainly the man to beat, and will probably have to be overcome by whoever wants to win a week on Sunday.

While it may be good to avoid Djokovic early on, things were partly evened up by the presence in Group A alongside him of world No 4 Stan Wawrinka, who is the one player to have seriously fallen out of form since the US Open in September.

The Swiss, who also has half an eye on the Davis Cup final versus France that follows the O2 event, has gone 2-4 in that time and is struggling to rediscover the momentum that carried him to the Australian Open final in January.

Not that Federer, who heads Murray’s Group B, is any pushover and he has a record of 14-1 since Flushing Meadows, his only loss being to Raonic in the Paris Masters quarter-finals last Friday.

The Canadian had been struggling before the last Masters event of the year, but reached the final in the French capital and has a record of 12-5 since New York.

He and Nishikori were the last two players to qualify, with the Japanese – the first Asian-born player to make the year-end finals – getting them both across the line late on Friday night when he knocked out the final contender David Ferrer, who will be the on-site alternate along with fellow Spaniard Feliciano Lopez.

While Murray has a good record in general against tall big servers he is 1-3 versus Raonic but 3-0 against Nishikori. His longer standing record against Federer stands at 11-11. After winning three ATP titles in six weeks Murray ought to be feeling relatively confident.

Regardless of the draw, the man to beat, clearly, is Djokovic, who seems to have been inspired by the recent birth of his son Stefan. Two players from each group go through to the semi-finals with the winners of the two pools playing the second-placed individual from the opposite side.
