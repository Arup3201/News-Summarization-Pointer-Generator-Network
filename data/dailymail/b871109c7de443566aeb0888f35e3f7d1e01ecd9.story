It was the first major naval battle of the Second World War, and led to the sinking of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee.

The Battle of the River Plate, which took place 75 years ago, was described by Winston Churchill as a 'brilliant sea fight' which took its place in Royal Navy annals.

Tomorrow, four of the handful of survivors will meet at the National Memorial Arboretum, where people remember Britain's war sacrifices, to unveil a monument to the famous victory.

The new memorial is a lasting tribute to the selfless courage of those who fought and lost their lives in the battle and the ships which fought it - heavy cruiser HMS Exeter, light cruisers HMS Ajax and Achilles and the Graf Spee.

Peter Danks, chairman of the HMS Ajax and River Plate Veterans Association, said: 'We are very proud to be unveiling our memorial which will ensure that all who took part in the Battle of the River Plate will be remembered always.'

The Battle of the River Plate occurred on December 13, 1939, when ships from the Royal Navy's South American Division took on the 12,000 tonne might of the German warship, which had been attacking British merchant vessels in the South Atlantic.

The Graf Spee was fast and heavily armoured and German commanders boasted 'anything it couldn't sink it could run away from'.

The memorial dedication at the arboretum, at Alrewas, Staffordshire will be attended by four River Plate veterans - John Garrard and Ted Wicks from HMS Ajax and Jim London and Basil Trott from HMS Exeter - families of those who served, as well Captain Stephen and Commander Henry Harwood - the sons of Commodore Henry Harwood. Above is Exeter

Commodore Henry Harwood, commanding Hunting Group G, ordered the Ajax, Achilles and Exeter - all around half the size of the towering German vessel - to an area east of the River Plate, an estuary between Argentina and Uruguay.

On the morning of the battle, Exeter investigated a plume of smoke and signalled, 'I think it is a Pocket Battleship'.

At 6.18am, Graf Spee opened fire on Exeter, scoring a direct hit, but Ajax and Achilles closed in causing significant damage to the German vessel.

A ferocious sea battle ensued, but 
just 20 minutes after the initial salvos Exeter, despite being badly 
damaged, dealt the decisive blow.

The British ship damaged Graf Spee's fuel system and galleys, forcing the captain to limp into Montevideo, Uruguay, shadowed by Ajax and Achilles.

The German ship's commanding officer Captain Hans Langsdorff requested 14 days to repair her damage but Uruguay - neutral, but with historic links to the UK - only allowed 72 hours.

Knowing that escape was no longer an option Graf Spee was scuttled in the River Plate on December 17.

The battle - in which 72 British sailors died - brought the first Royal Navy victory of the Second World War and gave a much-needed lift to the country's morale.

In a radio broadcast to the nation, Churchill said: 'This brilliant sea fight takes its place in our naval annals and in a long, cold, dark winter it warmed the cockles of the British hearts.'

Captain Stephen Harwood, the son of Commodore Harwood, who is also patron of the Memorial Dedication, said that the new monument would continue 'to fulfil Winston Churchill's prediction that this battle will long be told in song and story.'

The memorial dedication at the arboretum, at Alrewas, Staffordshire will be attended by four River Plate veterans - John Garrard and Ted Wicks from HMS Ajax and Jim London and Basil Trott from HMS Exeter - families of those who served, as well Captain Stephen and Commander Henry Harwood - the sons of Commodore Henry Harwood.

The £15,000 black granite monument stands around 6ft tall and weighs 2 tonnes.

The front of the memorial is engraved with the crests of the three Royal Navy vessels, a description of the battle and includes the words: 'It is dedicated to those who served in the ships at the battle and in subsequent action especially those who gave their lives.'

On the back is the Graf Spee's crest, an engraving of the battle area and the Churchill quote: 'This great battle will long be told in song and story.'

First major WWII naval engagement... and a captain's suicide

The Battle of the River Plate, which took place on December 13, 1939 was the first major naval battle of World War Two.

At
 dawn on that day, the Admiral Graf Spee - a German armored ship 
('pocket battleship') commanded by Captain Hans Langsdorff - made its way
 to the Rio De la Plata (River Plate) in South America as it hunted for 
enemy ships.

For 
several months, the Graf Spee had been carrying out commerce raiding in 
the region - a tactical move whereby it attacked enemy merchant 
ships.

The Graf Spee is seen arriving at the port of Montevideo before sinking

In a few short weeks, nine merchantmen totalling 450,000 tons 
had been destroyed.

Among the Allied
 ships on the lookout for her were the Ajax, Exeter and Achilles - under the command of Henry Harwood. And, on the fateful morning, they spotted her.

The 
British cruisers landed 20 hits on Graf Spee, killing 36 crew and 
wounding 60 more.

Although the
 ship could still fight, a shell had destroyed the kitchen and bakery 
and there was water in the oil tanks.

Following the heavy engagement, she 
fled to the neutral port of Montevideo in Uruguay for vital repairs.

It
 was then that Langsdorff took one of the most surprising and 
controversial decisions of the war.

Instead
 of leading his crew to certain death, he left most of the 350 men 
ashore and used a skeleton crew to sail the Graf Spee out of 
harbour and scuttle her.

Langsdorff's
 decision saved hundreds of men but it cost him his reputation among the
 Nazi high command and, ultimately, his life.

Hitler never forgave 
Langsdorff for what he considered cowardice: Nazi philosophy dictated 
that commandants died in their boots.

Though a hero to his men, 
Langsdorff was branded a traitor and his name excised from Nazi history.

Within days, he committed suicide with a revolver in a Buenos Aires 
hotel room.

The amazing story was brought to the screen in the epic 1956 war film 
The Battle Of The River Plate, starring Anthony Quayle as the British 
Commodore Harwood and Peter Finch as Langsdorff.
