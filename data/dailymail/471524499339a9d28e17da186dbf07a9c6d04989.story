At least eight people, including several bus passengers, were treated at the scene, city officials said.

One of the buses crashed into a light pole, causing it to topple, witnesses said.

'It sounded like something was falling from really high,' said Josh Price, visiting the city from Lafayette, New Jersey.

The glass in the front of the bus was shattered, and glass was strewn on the pavement.

Of the 15 people injured - 14 of them pedestrians - none were considered life-threatening, the Fire Department of New York said

Price said the scene was initially chaotic, with people running around trying to help. He said he saw one person on the ground holding his leg and bleeding.

Rose Cantillon was visiting the city from Ireland and was nearby.

'I was sitting on a bench, and I turned around and heard screaming, and I ran,' she said.

The cause of the accident was under investigation. Telephone calls to the tour bus companies seeking comment were not immediately returned on Tuesday.

Iconified as The Crossroads Of The World, Times Square is the hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry
