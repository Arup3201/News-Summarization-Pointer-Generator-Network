Cancer fight: Actress Angharad Rees

Actress Angharad Rees, best known for her role in the Seventies TV drama Poldark, has died following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

A statement released by her family said:
'Angharad passed away peacefully with her family at her 
bedside. She will be greatly missed by her family and friends.'

The Welsh star, 63, was married to the 
late Dynasty actor Christopher Cazenove for more than 20 years and they 
had two sons together, Linford and Rhys, 35.

Linford, the elder of the two, died in a car crash on the M11 in Essex in 1999, aged 26.

Rees starred as servant Demelza in the BBC's  18th century costume drama Poldark after first appearing on screen in The Way We Live Now in 1969.

She went on to star in a number of film and TV roles including Under Milk Wood and Moments with Keith Michell for which she was nominated for a ‘Best Newcomer’ award.

Rees also appeared in Dennis Potter’s Joe’s Ark, the cult classic Hands of the Ripper, As You Like It, Robin Hood, Remmington Steel with Pierce Brosnan, Jane Eyre, Love Story and Little Girl In Blue Velvet.

She  had an extensive theatre career on the West End stage, including A Winter’s Tale, Richard II, Romeo and Juliet Hamlet, John Osbourne’s A Picture of Dorian Gray, and An Ideal Husband. In radio, she won Prix Italia for Florent and the Tuxedo Millions in 1982 and was nominated for Best Actress in Radio in 1985.
