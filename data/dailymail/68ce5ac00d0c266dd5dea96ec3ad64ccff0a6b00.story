A British woman has died and an anaesthetist has been charged with manslaughter after performing a caesarean section while she was suspected of being drunk.

The woman's first child, a boy, was delivered safely in France last Friday, but his 28-year-old mother was taken to hospital in a coma and never recovered. She died on Tuesday.

The Belgian anaesthetist, 45, is said to have admitted to having a long-standing problem with alcohol and would carry 'vodka in a bottle of water'.

She is alleged to have inserted a tube from a ventilating machine into the patient's oesophagus instead of her windpipe. The patient was then starved of oxygen and suffered cardiac arrest.

When questioned on Tuesday the female anaesthetist was found to have 2.16g of alcohol per litre of blood – the equivalent of four bottles of wine. The legal driving limit in the UK is 0.8g/litre.

She faces a maximum of five years in prison. 

A French judge has put her under official examination – the equivalent in Britain of being charged – for 'aggravated manslaughter caused by the manifest and deliberate violation of the obligation of care and safety', The Guardian reported.

Local prosecutor Jean-Christophe Muller said it became clear after the boy was delivered that his mother was in pain and required more pain killers. 

After more was administered the woman began having difficulties breathing and the anaesthetist put her on an artificial respirator, before she was taken to hospital.

French prosecutor Jean-Christophe Muller said the woman had admitted drinking 'significant amounts of alcohol every day' and that she would carry vodka in a bottle of water

Mr Muller told the Guardian: 'During questioning she admitted she drank significant quantities of alcohol every day. She would carry vodka in a bottle of water.'

He said the anaesthetist admitted she drank alcohol every day and that when she was called upon to assist with the caesarean, she had been at a concert and cocktail party.

Mr Muller added: 'There are some very serious elements to make us think she had drunk excessively that evening.'

Neither the anaesthetist or the deceased woman have been named.
