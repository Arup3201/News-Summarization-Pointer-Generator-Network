Experts reacted with alarm at the figures, revealed by The Times newspaper.

Lucie Russell, director of campaigns and media for the charity Young Minds said the online world that children were growing up in fuelled self-harm.

She told The Times: ‘This has never happened before. It is the pressures of the modern world and some of these pressures are unprecedented.’

Ms Russell said the 24/7 online culture left young people living in the ‘constant present’. 

Pressures on teenagers such as bullying, sex and school work had existed before but ‘the online world is relatively new’.

She added: ‘It is uncharted territory.’

Young people feel a constant pressure to portray a certain lifestyle on social network sites, describing the perfect body and the right amount of friends.

‘Online they create a brand – brand me – which says I have loads of friends and this is how I look. They feel the need for constant reassurance and there is no privacy any more,’ Ms Russell said.

The online world has also created a new space for bullying.

She said: ‘In the old days you might get bullied at school but you could go home and shut the door. Now young people are on the phone all the time and there is no let up on it and it increases the pressure.’
