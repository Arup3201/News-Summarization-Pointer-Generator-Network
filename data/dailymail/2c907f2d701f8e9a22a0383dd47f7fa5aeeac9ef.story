The current generation of parents will probably be the first to be fitter than their children, former Olympic champion Lord Coe has warned.

The former Tory MP, who chairs the London 2012 organising committee, called for competitive sport to be promoted more in schools to help combat childhood obesity.

He urged politicians to capitalise on the success of the Games and demanded more focus on sport in primary schools.

'It is very important that we recognise that has to be underpinned by good quality physical education and by getting people into patterns of exercise,' Lord Coe told the Guardian.

'We have to recognise that we are probably going to be the first generation of parents that are marginally fitter than our kids.'

Central to London's successful bid to host the Olympics was a promise by organisers that the Games would inspire the nation's young people to become more involved in sport.

Lord Coe, who won Olympic gold medals in 1980 and 1984, said he was convinced that the Games had lived up to expectations.

But he urged politicians not to let a debate over the post-Games legacy to descend into political point scoring.

The shadow Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, has called for a cross-party consensus on the best way to maximise the positive impact of the Olympics.

She said: 'We mustn't confuse high quality physical education within schools, and competitive sport. They are, in essence, two different things.

'Done properly, they take you to the same virtuous outcome. Everybody recognises that giving young people a competitive outlet through sport is a very good thing.'

Next steps: Politicians are keen to capitalise on the success of the Games and encourage families to live more healthily
