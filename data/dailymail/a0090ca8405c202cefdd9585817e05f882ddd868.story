A dad who told staff at Manchester Airport his pregnant wife had cancer to claim a free family holiday worth £7,000 has been jailed.

John Williams, 35, who admitted attempted fraud when his web of lies was exposed, was jailed at Liverpool crown court for two years.

Williams’ deceit began when he phoned the airport’s customer contact centre to make a complaint.

Why does everyone want to go to Florida: The jobless dad-of-two claimed he was a doctor and that his wife had pancreatic cancer. He said she had contacted Airline Direct Travel to book a family holiday to Florida and overheard the call taker say 'Why does everyone with cancer want to go to Florida?'

The jobless dad-of-two claimed he was a doctor and that his wife had pancreatic cancer. He said she had contacted Airline Direct Travel (ADT) – the airport’s online travel agent – to book a family holiday to Florida.

He said she was put on hold and overheard the call taker say ‘Why does everyone with cancer want to go to Florida?’

His wife, he said, collapsed. And he also told them that his neighbour was so outraged he contacted the press.

On July 26 last year, Manchester Airport was made aware of the complaint and offered Williams a free holiday, on the basis his story was true.

ADT organised free flights to Orlando and accommodation worth £7,000. But when the travel agent investigated further, Williams’ lies unravelled.

A full audit of their telephone records found no trace of the alleged conversation. This led to their cancellation of the holiday, costing the Manchester Airports Group, part-owned by Manchester taxpayers, £3,500.

But Williams, from St Helens, persisted, calling a member of airport staff to threaten them with complaints to holiday watchdog ABTA and the press.

He said he wanted his holiday or for the airport to cancel its contract with ADT – but was told neither of these things would happen.

When brazen Williams turned up at the airport on August 17 last year with his wife and two children, he was arrested.

Pc Simon Booth from the airport said: 'Williams deceived both his family and staff at Manchester Airport.

'He told his wife he was employed, but in fact he had no job and said he wanted to provide a holiday for his family, but could not do this without being dishonest.

'Williams may have had financial difficulties, but it is unspeakable to falsely claim his wife had cancer in order to get a free holiday.'
