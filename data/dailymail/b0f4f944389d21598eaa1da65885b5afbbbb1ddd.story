Noah Ritter revealed more of his star potential on Wednesday when he charmed morning show viewers with another hilarious interview.

The five-year-old, from Pottstown, Pennsylvania, stole the nation's hearts with his live TV interview last Friday on the opening day of the Wayne County Fair. 

Noah's clip - where he happily chats to the camera about super slides, his grandfather and how he doesn't watch TV news, all the while exhibiting a fondness for the word 'apparently' - has now had close to three million views on YouTube.

Noah appeared on GMA live at 8.30am this morning, waving wildly at the camera and treating viewers to a massive yawn.

Noah Ritter, five, from Pottstown, Pennsylvania, shared more of his hilarious take on the world on Wednesday morning on GMA

Noah  treated viewers to some energetic waving and a huge yawn this morning during another hilarious TV slot

The adorable five-year-old was amused by the idea that he should become a TV presenter when he grows up instead of his dream job, a paleontologist

The red-haired preschooler was asked by presenter Michael Strahan how it felt to be on TV, to which Noah responded: 'It's great, it's so great because I really never had any people like me. Fans... are you kidding me?'

The five-year-old then told Strahan, newly-minted to the NFL Hall Of Fame: 'I know you're a part of the Giants... I used to like the Giants but my grandfather brainwashed me into liking the Steelers.'

He then agreed with Strahan that he really liked dinosaurs, plenty of which were in display behind him, adding: 'I brainwashed myself to like dinosaurs.'

The team erupted into laughter, but not much gets passed Noah, as he remarked: 'Now they're just laughing.'

Strahan asked the five-year-old what he wants to be when he grows up. Noah replied: 'I'm going to be a paleontologist. He studies lots and lots of different types of dinosaurs.'

Noah also told viewers about his love of swimming and when Strahan asked if he could beat him, he quickly answered: 'Yes. I'm a very good swimmer. I've even won long races.'

Amy Robach then asked Noah if he would ever be a news presenter, to which he shook his head and said: 'No, I'm being a paleontologist.'

Noah was on a media blitz on Wednesday. He also told Today that he was thinking of retiring the word 'apparently', for a few simple reasons.

He said: 'I don't know how to spell ''apparently''. I don't know what it means, but I use it in, ''Wow, this is apparently annoying.'''

The five-year-old does have a way with words, however, telling the Today show that fame was like 'being a thousand drops of heaven'.

Viewers were first introduced to Noah last week when he was stopped at the country fair in Honesdale by a WNEP TV crew.  

But while reporter Sofia Ojeda was seeking a verdict on the ride he had just been on with his grandfather, Noah had his own agenda.

Exhibiting a fondness for the word 'apparently', he said: 'It was great and apparently I’ve never been on live television but apparently sometimes I don’t watch the news because I’m a kid and apparently every time Grandpa just gives me the remote I have to watch the Powerball.' 

Still attempting to get her soundbite, Ms Ojeda asked again how Noah had enjoyed his ride, only to get more of his adorable perspective on life. 

'Well, it was great because apparently you’re spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy, that’s all you do is get dizzy,' he said. 'I’ve never ever been on live television. I've never been on live television.'

Noah's hilarious TV interview - where he managed to use the word 'apparently' eight times inside 90 seconds has gone viral with three million views on YouTube alone

The amused reporter, who is just seen crouching down to speak at his level asked: 'Are you excited?'

To which Noah replied: 'Yeah, and apparently I only went down the super slide. . . I was scared half to death. I just freak out.'

Noah used the word 'apparently' no less than eight times during the one-and-a-half-minute interview, and repeated that he had never been on live television three times.

Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, who took him to the fair, told ABC News: 'Noah is pretty talkative. He has a large vocabulary.'

He added that his grandson appears to be enjoying his new-found fame.

'We were watching it on the computer and it replayed on the local news,' Mr Borowski said. 'He’s going, "That’s me. I’m a celebrity."'

But for Noah, who is spending the summer with his grandfather, TV fame comes a lowly third place in his list of favorite things. Mr Borowski said his first loves are dinosaurs and swimming.

'We go down to the history museum in Philadelphia about once a month because he loves the dinosaurs,' the grandfather said. 'And we go for swim lessons every Saturday morning because he loves to swim.'
