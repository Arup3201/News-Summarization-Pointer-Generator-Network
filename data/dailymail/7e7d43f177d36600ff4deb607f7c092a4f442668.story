Kayla R. Oxenham is alleged to have branded her two children, aged five and seven, with a burning stick so she could identify them as her own

A mother of two has been arrested and accused of branding her two children with a heated stick so she would know they were her own.

Police said Kayla Oxenham, 23, used a lighter to set the stick on fire before pressing it against the children's bodies in order to mark them so she would know they were her own kids.

The Port Charlotte, Florida, woman was taken to Charlotte County Jail after police discovered the alleged abuse following a tip-off from child welfare authorities.

Aged only five and seven, the children told police their mother did it so she knew they were her children, and so they could have ice cream.

Oxenham was taken to Charlotte County Jail on June 17.

When spoken to by police, she denied the abuse had occurred.

The Charlotte County Sherrif's Office website lists Oxenham as married and her profession as a medical assistant.

NBC News reported the children told police their mother said she 'forgot how much she loved fire' when the branding took place.

The children were taken for medical tests, where police discovered one of them had noticeable burn injuries.

Oxenham was released on a $15,000 bond the following day.
