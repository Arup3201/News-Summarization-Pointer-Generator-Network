Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has renewed calls for Australia to become a republic as campaigners continue to demand the country should have a new flag, minus the Union Jack.

'Let us have the courage to ask ourselves if we measure up to more than just a grab-bag of clichés,' Mr Shorten said.

The Labor leader used a speech on the eve of Australia Day to urge Australians to breathe new life into the dream of an Australian head of state.

Speaking at a book launch in Melbourne, Mr Shorten urged: 'Let us declare that our head of state should be one of us.

On the eve of Australia Day, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has renewed calls for Australia to become a republic

'Let us rally behind an Australian republic - a model that truly speaks for who we are, our modern identity, our place in our region and our world.'

'Let us be brave enough to demand constitutional recognition for the first Australians, and let us breathe new life into the dream of an Australian head of state,' he added.

His comments have been echoed by Australian Republican Movement chairman Geoff Gallop who admits pushing the cause is hard work.

On current figures, a third of Australians want an Australian head of state, a third favour the current system, and the rest remain to be convinced either way.

Mr Gallop welcomed the latest intervention by Mr Shorten.

But there just isn't the kind of support for a republic that there was at the time of the 1999 referendum, he said.

Mr Gallop said it was tough work - although he believed more Australians wanted a republic than didn't.

'It's hard work for us republicans - there's no doubt about that,' he told ABC radio.

'There is no doubt that the failure of the referendum in 1999 set the campaign back.'

Mr Gallop said the Australian constitution wasn't truly independent, with the head of state determined by hereditary processes that have emerged from the history of another country.

'The great unifying thing to do would be say let's have a proper process, have a democratic engagement and determine a model for the future. Those of us who believe have just go to keep their advocacy up,' he said.

'At each step we go forward in this way, our confidence lifts up and we are better as a nation.'

The fight for a republic coincides with further calls for the Australian flag to be changed.

Many believe the Union Jack should be ditched from the flag, including journalist and commentator Derryn Hinch.

'It should have been changed in 1988. I was living in Canada when its flag was changed to the Maple leaf; it was a great thing for Canada. We should remove the Union Jack,' Hinch told Daily Mail Australia.

'What should be on it is should be for others to decide. The current flag was won in a competition set up by a tobacco company,' he said, adding that he doesn't want to see 'a boxing kangaroo' on a new flag.

TV presenter Ray Martin also wants the Aussie flag redesigned.

Writing for News.com.au he asked: 'How many of our soldiers died fighting under those state flags? None.

'So why are those state flags all still so untouchable, too? And what does it say about us and our need to cling to the apron strings of England 114 years after Federation?'
