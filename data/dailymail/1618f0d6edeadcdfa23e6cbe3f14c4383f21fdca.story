Two cases of gold ingots, containing 44 kilos of gold, were stolen from the plane

Thieves have taken £1million worth of gold bars from an Air France plane leading to accusations of an inside job.

The solid gold ingots were part of a multi-million pound cargo of nine cases containing 300 kilograms of gold.

Detectives said that 44 kilos of gold ingots were taken from a plane travelling from the French capital to Zurich last Thursday.

They were being handled by the American Brink's secure transportation company, which regularly transfers valuables on the same route.

The nine cases set off from Charles de Gaulle airport but only seven cases reached the tarmac on the other side, police said.

'We are investigating the matter, and especially the possibility that this was an inside job,' said an investigating source.

The news comes just two weeks after £170million worth of pure cocaine 
was found being shipped from South America to Paris on board another Air
France aircraft.

The record-breaking 1.3 tonne haul was packed into 30 separate suitcases and all originated in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela.

All had been registered to passengers who did not exist and were not registered on the flight.

Six members of an international drug gang, including three Britons, were arrested following the discovery on September 11th.

The other three are Italian and are thought to have connections to the country's infamous Mafia.

Three Venezuelan soldiers, a first sergeant, a second sergeant and a first lieutenant, were arrested on Sunday and will be charged, the country's prosecutor's office said.

According to Venezuela’s Justice and Interior Minister, Miguel Rodriguez, it is ‘almost certain’ there were accomplices working within Air France.

He said: ‘How can the cocaine shipment reach France and it gets taken out without going through the normal controls?’

The news will be embarrassing for Air France whose staff is already facing investigation over a record-breaking £170million haul of cocaine discovered on a flight from Venezuela on September 11th

Film from security cameras at the Simon Bolivar International Airport in Caracas were being examined, and staff questioned, he added.

None of the suspects have been named to assist police in tracking down other gang members who may go into hiding.

Around 900kilos of the cocaine was seized at Charles de Gaulle airport itself, while the remaining 400kg was already in a truck on its way to Luxembourg.

Charles de Gaulle airport itself has a notorious reputation for lax security, with baggage regularly stolen.

An incredible four tonnes of cocaine has been seized in France since the start of the year – putting the country firmly at the centre of drug routes into Europe.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime considers Britain to be the centre of Europe’s lucrative cocaine market it, and much of it arrives through France.
