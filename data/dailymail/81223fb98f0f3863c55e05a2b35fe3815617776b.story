A cowboy builder charged a single mother £38,000 to renovate her home - but left her without electricity, plumbing, a bathroom or a kitchen.

Shane Truckle, 32, wreaked havoc on the bungalow in Fareham, Hampshire, and then abandoned the job before it was complete.

Inspectors described his work as 'unprofessional' and 'unconventional', and found he had breached a staggering 26 building regulations.

Lisa Overington, 45, is now living out of boxes in her mother’s conservatory, while other workmen battle to correct his errors.

The mother-of-three has been been forced to double her mortgage on her property to pay for the repairs.

In total she is more than £50,000 out of pocket.

Mrs Overington recruited Truckle’s firm - Taylor Carpentry Ltd - last summer to carry out £38,000 of improvements on her home.

She paid the sum, with further instalments to follow, Fareham Magistrates Court heard.

But Truckle, from Sarisbury Green, 
Hants, abandoned the work in September after only comp;eting half the 
job - and short of the 86 per cent that Mrs Overington had already paid.

When building control
officers were called in, they found 'unprofessional and non-compliant' 
work and 'unconventional' building practices.

They identified structural errors, 
said incorrect building materials had been used, and found some of them 
abandoned on the site.

The damage was so bad that workmen have since had to tear out parts where errors were made and start again.

Mrs Overington said: 'There is no electricity, no plumbing, no kitchen, no bathroom, no walls - it is an empty shell of a house.

Abandoned: The state of the house after builder Shane Truckle had started work, leaving rubbish in the side garden

Disappointing: The condition of tiling on the rear roof at Mrs Overington's home

'There is not even a sound roof yet and there is so much to do.

'He wiped out a year of my life and stolen my future, because I have had to double my mortgage.

'To say he has ruined my life is not an overstatement.

'I have spent every weekend at that house clearing the rubbish and doing as much as I can to make it right.

'It has consumed my life and will do for some time to come.'

Magistrates convicted Truckle of 26 counts of failing to comply with building regulations.

He failed to attend court and did not enter a plea.

Truckle must now pay £18,423 compensation, £5,200 fine, and £4,540 legal costs.

He was also ordered to pay £15 into a fund for victims of crime.

Mrs Overington hopes to be back in the home before Christmas, but it will not be decorated and will contain only basic facilities.

A planning inspector today described Truckle's work as among the worst he had seen in his 17 years as an officer.

Paul Gosling, who led the investigation for Fareham Borough Council, warned the work was so poor the building was at risk of collapsing.

He said: 'During my 17 years' experience in Building Control this is potentially one of the worst examples of building practices I have witnessed from a builder.

'The defects and contraventions identified suggest that the builder did not have a suitable level of competence to be carrying out building works in a manner which would satisfy the minimum requirements of the Building Regulations.

'Tailored Carpentry Ltd created a notable number of significant defects, many structural defects, which if not corrected could have resulted in structural collapse of areas of the building.'

Councillor Trevor Cartwright, who is responsible for building control at the council, welcomed the prosecution.

He said: 'The offences represented a serious and dangerous breach of the Building Regulations which had potentially put the homeowner at significant risk.

'I am pleased that the builder was found guilty of the contraventions and I am also pleased that the courts have ordered the builder to pay a considerable amount of compensation to the owner to assist with the rebuilding of her home.'
