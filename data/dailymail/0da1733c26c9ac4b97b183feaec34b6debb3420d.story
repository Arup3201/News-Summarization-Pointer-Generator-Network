A knifeman has been sectioned after he allegedly plunged a knife into the chest of a teenager, killing her as she sat on a bus on her way to school.

Christina Edkins, 16, died from a single stab wound to the chest when she was stabbed on the top deck of a Birmingham bus.

CCTV footage shows the suspect standing with his back to the driver and his hands on the door handles,  calmly waiting to make his escape just seconds after killing Christina.

The 22-year-old man used a series 
of buses in the area, possibly while still armed, before returning to 
the scene and being arrested 100 yards away a few hours later.

Suspect: Detectives released this image of the man who they claimed was their prime suspect

The image of the man, holding a white 
bag and wearing a distinctive black hooded top with a tiger motif on the
 back, was taken on a No 9 bus in Birmingham city centre on Thursday 
morning.

It was released as witnesses and 
police described the terrifying final moments of Christina’s life, and 
her family began to speak of their ‘absolute devastation’.

The schoolgirl, who had previously 
tweeted fears about being followed by a man on a bus, had been sitting 
on the top deck in front of the knifeman, who approached her slowly from
 behind without speaking, stabbed her suddenly in the chest and 
‘casually’ walked away.

Tragic: Christina Edkins, 16, was in her uniform on the top deck of the bus in Birmingham city centre when she was stabbed in the chest by a man

Only one other person was upstairs – a
 schoolboy who heard her screams and rushed to help. Passengers 
downstairs also heard her shouts.

Some have since spoken of fearing for their lives as the knifeman waited to get off.

Christina, who was wearing school 
uniform and was due to sit an exam that day, had boarded the bus just 
after 7.30am on Thursday near her home in the city centre.

She walked upstairs, taking her seat 
in front of the man who would kill her minutes later as she made her way
 to Leasowes Community College in Halesowen, about five miles away.

‘The bus was in the process of 
stopping when the attack took place,’ said Detective Superintendent 
Richard Baker from West Midlands Police.

‘There was no conversation between 
him and Christina at all. The suspect calmly walked up behind Christina 
and stabbed her. It happened really, really quickly.

'This was not a frenzied attack. He’s 
walked downstairs, waited for the bus to stop and walked off. It was 
[over] in one or two seconds.’

The attack has been captured on CCTV. 
The officer said he believed Christina did not initially realise what 
had happened to her, before suddenly screaming out.

A teenage boy, aged about 16 and from
 a different school, was sitting at the back of the bus and ran 
downstairs to tell the driver to call 999.

‘He was sitting behind the attacker, 
on the back seat. He was in his own world. She has clearly called for 
help,’ Mr Baker added.

A mother of two came face to face with the killer as he waited to get off.

Tributes: Friends lay floral tributes near to where Miss Edkins died. Christina, who recently turned 16, had also told friends she hated travelling on public transport, saying she could not wait for her next birthday when she could start to drive

Respects: As police continued to question their 22-year-old suspect, friends and strangers visited the scene to lay flowers

Stephanie Bent would later rush 
upstairs and try desperately to revive Christina with two other women 
but had to wait for a few awful moments, fearing for her own life, as 
the killer stood beside her by the bus doors before escaping.

‘I knew what he had done and he was 
stood next to me when he was getting off,’ she wrote on Facebook. ‘All I
 could think of was, I hope he gets off this stop so I can go upstairs 
and help the girl.’

Yesterday, schoolfriends left floral 
tributes to Christina near the scene of her death. Christina’s parents 
Jason, 42, and Kathleen, 47, were said to be ‘absolutely devastated’.

Distraught: A steady stream of mourners visited the scene where Christina died

Shrine: By yesterday afternoon, the pile of flowers and tributes had grown into a shrine to the schoolgirl

Her brother Ryan, 18, thanked friends 
for their support and wrote on Twitter that he ‘would do anything’ to 
see her again. ‘It is mad to think I will never see you again,’ he 
added. ‘I love you.’

Four weeks before her death, Christina
 had written on Twitter: ‘This man is worrying me on the bus keeps 
getting up and walking up and down stairs, and sitting in different 
places.’

Police, who are yet to recover the knife, believe the attack was random.

A 22-year-old man arrested on suspicion of fatally stabbing Christina was last night sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

Police said experts had deemed him unfit to be interviewed by them any further.
