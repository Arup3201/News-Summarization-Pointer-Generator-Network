Russell Slade claimed an inspired substitution after Romain Vincelot came off the bench to strike an 88th-minute winner as Leyton Orient dumped Aston Villa out of the Capital One Cup.

The Frenchman with a name from Arthurian legend made his goal look a lot simpler than pulling sword out of stone by ghosting onto Bradley Pritchard’s cross five minutes after being introduced to inflict more cup misery on Paul Lambert.

The Villa manager has now suffered shock defeats to lower-league opposition in each of his three campaigns at the helm.

In the build up to this match he spoke of the hurt still felt after League Two Bradford’s unlikely semi-final win in this competition two seasons ago, while Sheffield United triumphed here in last season’s FA Cup.

Darren Bent, on his first Villa appearance since May 2013, had two excellent opportunities to ensure it would be third time lucky but missed both.

The former England striker was thwarted by Orient goalkeeper Gary Woods after a pinpoint finish from Joe Cole’s pass in the first half and horribly miscued when clean through 10 minutes from time with the score 0-0.

But Orient were decent value for their win and would have scored sooner but for the brilliance of Shay Given. The Irish goalkeeper was pulling on his first Villa shirt in 19 months and pulled off a stunning save from Mathieu Baudry’s header 20 minutes from time to keep the scores level.

The 38-year-old lost his place to Brad Guzan two years ago and was drafted into Lambert’s coaching team amid turmoil at the end of last season, but showed he remains a fine shot-stopper with a full-stretch dive to palm Baudry’s header onto the post.

Villa suffered a record 10 home league defeats last season and Lambert wants an immediate reaction when Hull are the visitors on Sunday.

For Orient, it is a trip to Fleetwood Town next. They face Sheffield United in the next round of this competition.

Slade, who has beaten Lambert twice before in his career, praised his team’s work ethic, desire and organisation. ‘Aston Villa weren’t at their very best. We’ve performed at a decent level for a League One team and enough to get us a result,’ he added. 

‘It is another great night for this football club. To come to a place of great tradition and get a result is a wonderful feeling for everybody.

‘My message was quite simple: we carry the flag, we plant it in the ground and we fight for everything.’

Lambert believed his team should have scored but admitted Given’s save was ‘a warning sign we never took head of’’. ‘We had enough chances to win two games let alone one,’ he said. ‘I didn’t think we defended their goal well.

‘I’m really disappointed to get knocked out. I thought the team was strong enough to win the game.’

Lambert made seven changes to his team from Saturday’s 0-0 draw with Newcastle but it remained a selection that should have deposed Orient.

There was a Villa debut for 32-year-old Cole, and at the other end of the spectrum a first start to Jack Grealish, the talented 18-year-old winger involved in a tug of war between the FAs of England and Ireland.

With his socks rolled down, Grealish showed just why the fight has broken out with a performance of daring runs.

A subdued Villa Park crowd responded, urging the teenager to shoot after a run on the hour mark. He let fly but his effort was deflected wide. From Ashley Westwood’s corner Nathan Baker rose highest but headed just over.

Not long after Vincelot showed him how it should be done, his second goal of this year’s competition.
