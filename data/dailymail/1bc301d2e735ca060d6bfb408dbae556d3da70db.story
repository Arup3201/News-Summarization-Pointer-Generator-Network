Three men suspected of gang-raping an elderly Indian nun at a convent have been pictured for the first time. 

The woman, who is in her 70s, was trying to prevent  the men from robbing the Christian missionary school when she was attacked.

CCTV has now been released showing the suspects leaving the staff room on Friday night. A reward of 100,000 rupees (around £1,075) is on offer for any leads, police said.

Five others have been detained for questioning about the attack at the Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal.

Three men suspected of gang-raping an elderly Indian nun at the Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal have been pictured for the first time

Arnab Ghosh, a police superintendent, said: 'CCTV footage showed that six men, aged between 20 and 30, scaled the boundary wall around 11.40pm and entered the school and disconnected the telephone lines.'  

The robbers then tied up and gagged a security guard before entering the nuns' room, where they found the women sleeping, police said.

When the victim, who is the oldest nun at the school, tried to stop them taking another woman into a separate room they raped her.

The men escaped with some cash, a mobile phone, a laptop computer and a camera. They also ransacked the school's chapel and took holy items. Footage shows books and papers strewn across the floor as the men leave the staff room.

Mr Ghosh added: 'At least two of them were armed and the rest were carrying burglary tools. In the chapel, a holy scripture was found torn and a bust of Jesus was broken.' 

The nun is recovering in hospital in Ranaghat.  

Furious  residents took to the streets yesterday, shouting slogans demanding action and blocking off the main highway.

Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal Chief Minister, also tweeted her condemnation of what she called a 'horrific attack', promising 'swift, strong action'.

Archbishop Thomas D'Souza has appealed to people to maintain peace and harmony in the area.

He said: 'In our Sunday Mass, we prayed for the sister to recover quickly from trauma, fear and her physical injuries. We will pray for her again this evening.

'They not only committed a heinous crime, but they also vandalized the chapel. This is the first time such an attack has happened in India.'

The incident comes at a time of heightened sensitivity over women's safety in India, which last week saw  a documentary about the 2012 gang-rape of a student in Delhi being banned.

Authorities said screening the documentary could have caused public disorder, but critics accused the government of being more concerned with the country's reputation than the safety of its women. 

Shocking footage also emerged this week of an angry mob stripping and slowly beating a man to death in an Indian village after he was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. 

The prolonged attack on the 18-year-old was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd.
