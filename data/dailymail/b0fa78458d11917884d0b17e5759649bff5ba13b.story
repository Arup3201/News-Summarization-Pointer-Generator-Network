A new mother has lost over 4st in preparation for her dream wedding, using a hypnotherapy app that claims to create a 'virtual gastric band'.

Amber Jacobs, 30, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, gained weight when pregnant with her daughter, reaching 13st 2lb two months after giving birth, and was desperate to shed the pounds before she tied the knot.

Having tried numerous fad diets throughout her life, Amber decided to try a new - and unusual - method. The app she chose uses mental training to reduce the amount you want to eat.

'I've always had a big appetite and portion control was a big problem 
from me,' she explains. 'I learned a lot of bad habits from my mother, who has also been a yo-yo dieter.

'When I was pregnant "eating for two" was a big thing and then when I was alone at home with my daughter I would graze.'

Amber's motivation to tackle her weight came, in addition to wanting to look good for her wedding, from her grandmother Sandra who passed away a month before the birth of her daughter.

'She was a very special woman to me and before she died said: "Do the most you can for your daughter and be there for her."

'I promised her I would sort myself out,' she says.

Realising that traditional diet regimes were not going to work for her, Amber was inspired by a session of hypnotherapy she had in her youth to tackle low self-esteem.

She searched online and came across a £4.99 hypno-app which promised that it could help her to tackle the reasons she overate.

Amber says: ‘I started using the app in January 2013, two months after having my daughter and after the Christmas break was over.

‘I felt enormous pressure to lose the baby weight and also to look good for the wedding. I wanted to do it for me but comments from the family also spurred me on.

‘I've tried numerous plans over the years. As soon as I thought I was putting on weight I'd try a fad diet and always ended up losing the weight then putting double on. I couldn't maintain it. I'm a petite person so a little weight really shows.

‘They all worked in the short term but I found when I'm not allowed something I want it even more and found them unsustainable or eating more because I still had 'points/sins' left.’

Rather than banning or restricting certain foods, Amber used the hypnosis and mental training on the Virtual Gastric Band app, which offers a step-by-step hypnotherapy program that guides you to weight loss, to try and turn herself off the unhealthy food, as well as increasing portion control. To her surprise, she found it began to work.

‘I noticed a change very quickly in my eating habits. I have always been conscious of eating healthily but do like my Chinese and Indian takeaways and general junk.

‘I seemed to go off those or choose healthier options from the menu and really cut down my portion sizes. I lost 4lb in the first week and was ecstatic it was working without cutting out a food type.’

I feel so much better and more confident. I find I'm not in between sizes and more and find it easier to find clothes. I still have body hang-ups but no longer need to hide under baggy or frumpy clothes.

'I also am happy with photos that are taken with my daughter without thinking how awful I look.

‘It also made me so much more excited about my wedding! When I went to try on wedding dresses none of them fitted in the shop!  Now I've got my dream dress - but two sizes smaller!'

In addition to transforming her body, Amber says the app helped her deal with the challenges of having a young child by keeping her calm and well rested.

‘I found that listening to the hypnosis calmed me down and made me focus on myself. It gave me a positive outlook and relaxed me.

‘I found I wasn't sleeping well with a new-born and all thoughts to do with wedding plans and the hypnosis just helped me 'zone out' and achieve a healthy night’s sleep.

‘It also helped me de-stress when my daughter went down for a nap. It has done wonders for me and my self-esteem, I'm proud that I did this myself without effort.’
