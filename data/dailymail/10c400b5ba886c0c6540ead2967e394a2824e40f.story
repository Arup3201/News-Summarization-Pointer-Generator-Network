The eight-year-old boy who was tragically killed by falling concrete slabs at a construction site two days before Christmas has been described as a happy child 'with heaps of energy'.

Erwin Makafana was playing at a Tongan community church construction site in Sydney's southwest, while his father and elder brother Alalate, 17, helped build a fence, when the slabs fell on him.

Erwin's distraught brother discovered he'd been injured after one of the men shouted out that someone was 'trapped,' News.com.au reports.

'He's a kid with heaps of energy, always has a smile on his face and I'll always miss him,' the boy's brother Alalate Makafana reportedly told Seven News.
