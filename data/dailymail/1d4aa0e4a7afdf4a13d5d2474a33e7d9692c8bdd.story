A yob who has admitted leaving a nine-year-old girl with horrific facial injuries when he hurled a glass bottle through a moving car's window.

Matthew McCrea, 24, threw the beer bottle at a Fiat Punto as it drove along the A693 in Stanley, County Durham on Valentine's Day, leaving young Abbie Keers requiring plastic surgery on her face.

Recovery: Abbie was immediately rushed to hospital and needed surgery to remove pieces of glass from just below her left eye. Although the incident was traumatic, she is not permanently scarred

Durham Crown Court heard yesterday that Abbie Keers was in the passenger seat of the car when McCrea thew the beer bottle towards it.

The passenger side window was shattered and Abbie was showered with broken glass.

Also in the vehicle at the time were Abbie's grandmother Sandra Webb - a former Northumbria police officer - her mother Clare Webb, and her younger sister Lexi, who was three at the time.

Abbie was immediately rushed to hospital and needed surgery to remove pieces of glass from her face from just below her left eye.

Although the incident was traumatic for the youngster, she is not permanently scarred.

Fortunate: Abbie suffered cuts to her forehead, hands, nose and around her left eye. She was lucky not to lose her sight during the incident, and has managed to avoid being scarred for life

Brave: Abbie Keers has been praised by police for her behaviour after the incident

Abbie, who has been praised by police for her bravery, said: 'We were just driving along and I was playing on my iPad and then started dozing off. Then the bottle came through the window.'

'I thought my granâ€™s tyre had popped, because it was more like a bang than glass breaking,' she added.

'When my friends found out what had happened they thought it was disgusting,' Abbie went on.

Her grandmother Sandra Webb said: 'It was like the biggest explosion and sounded similar to when an air bag goes off in a car.'

'Abbie is quite a resilient little girl and she has done well to cope with what she has.'

Abbie also suffered cuts to her forehead, hands, nose and around her right eye. She was lucky not to lose her sight during the incident.

'The glass cut into my face and was stinging - it was very painful. But the doctors said I had been very lucky,' she said.

McCrea is due back at Durham Crown Court in June.

His defence team says the act was accidental and not reckless.

McCrea was granted unconditional bail while the advice of experts is sought to assess at what speed the bottle collided with the car.
