A Utah man has been arrested for murder nearly a year after he allegedly shot his wife in the head then faked a frantic 911 call and blamed an unidentified black man for the killing.

Police say Conrad Truman, 31, killed his 25-year-old wife Heidy at the end of September in a bid to collect her life insurance policy - valued at more than $878,000.

Authorities say Truman threatened 911 dispatchers and responding medics and police officers who arrived at the couple's suburban home in Orem, Utah, but did nothing help resuscitate his dying wife.

Busted: Conrad Truman, 31, was arrested in his wife's 2012 murder nearly ten months after she was fatally shot

Tragic: Police say Conrad Truman pressed a pistol against his wife Heidy's head and shot her at point blank range in their suburban Utah home. She was 23

From the beginning Truman's stories were inconsistent and full of holes, investigators say. Still, it took Orem police nearly ten months to charge him with Heidy's murder, the Salt Lake Tribune reports.

Before his arrest during a traffic stop on Friday, Truman was a free man. 

Detectives say it took them until now to gather all of the evidence against Truman in order to charge him.

Police say that Truman pressed his Sig Sauer .380-caliber pistol against Heidy's head and shot her at point blank range in the couple's kitchen.

He then called 911 and gave a frantic description of his wife's death to dispatchers.

'There's so much blood. If they don't get here right now, she's gonna die,' he wails.

Heidy had life insurance policies totaling more than $878,000 at the time of her death - with all of the money payable to her husband

'I don't know what happened. I really don't know what happened, I swear to God. She was in the shower, she came out of the shower and I heard a pop, and there's blood, and she's in blood.'

Later, he shouts 'If you don't get here quick, my wife's life is on your head. My wife.'

When officers arrived, he was covered in blood and gave several explanations of what had happened. 

One story he told officers was that an unidentified black man had shot her through a window while she was taking a bath. She then stumbled, naked, into the kitchen where she died.

'Conrad said he saw a black male run out of the home just before Heidy was shot. Conrad said Heidy may have been shot through the window or wall in the shower, and she was murdered,' according to the police report. 

He also said that she may have shot herself.

Forensic evidence, however, did not match either of those explanations, according to police.

When officers later tried to question Truman at his workplace after he failed to return their phone calls for weeks, he refused to speak to them.

'You have questions, well they can wait until I'm ready. I don't know nothing man,' he fumed.

He is being held on $1million cash bail, charged with first degree murder and obstruction of justice.
