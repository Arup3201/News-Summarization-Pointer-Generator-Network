They sent Daniel Craig's career into the stratosphere and set a million women's hearts racing.

Now THOSE blue swimming trunks worn by Craig during THAT scene in Casino Royale, have sold for a staggering £44,450.

The shorts were just one of 50 items 
of James Bond memorabilia sold in Christie's charity sale, which raised a total of £752,050, to 
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first 007 movie Dr No.

Steamy: The infamous swimming trunks worn by Daniel Craig in Bond film Casino Royale fetched £44,450

...And this is what they look like on: Daniel Craig emerges from the sea in THOSE shorts during THAT scene in 2006 Bond film Casino Royale

The size large navy and powder blue trunks by La Perla, labelled GrigioPerla and made in Italy, raised money for the Women For Women charity.

Other lots included a one-third scale model of an Aston Martin 
DB5 used in the filming of Skyfall, the next Bond adventure set to hit the big screen in October, which raised £61,250 for the Tickets for Troops charity.

The car was used in earlier Bond films and has become closely associated with the fictional double agent and was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder.

Although this hefty price tag wasn't as much as the 2008 Aston Martin, 6 Litre V12 DBS, two-door coupe driven by Craig in the most recent film, Quantum of Solace, which sold for £241,250.

Michael G Wilson, who along with Barbara Broccoli is guardian of the Bond films, said: 'In Skyfall we go back to the old Aston Martin, the DB5, we bring that out of mothball.

Killer ride: Another Aston Martin built in 2008 and used in the opening sequence of the last Bond movie Quantum of Solace had a price tag of £241,250

'We
used it in the film but we had to make a model of it. We made an extra 
model, one third scale that was made for the film and I think that’s
a pretty unique thing to get.'

Other famous items that raised charitable funds were a titanium Omega Seamaster Professional Planet Ocean watch, worn by Craig in the much anticipated new film, which sold for £157,250.

There was also a navy wool Tom Ford suit worn by Daniel Craig in the new Skyfall film and although it was estimated to sell for between £2,000 and £3,000 it fetched a jaw-dropping £46,850.

The complete works of Ian Fleming, the spy's creator, were another huge success for Christy's: estimated to go for between £10,000 and £15,000 they were sold for £91,250 in a frenzied bidding battle.

A surprise last minute addition to the auction was the orchestral score from the hotly anticipated Skyfall theme song by Adele. Signed on the cover by the singer herself and co-writer Paul Epworth, the item sold for £13,750.

Auctioneer Hugh Edmeades led 
proceedings, assisted by several guest auctioneers including Sir Roger 
Moore,  Dame Judi Dench, Samantha Bond, Lucy Fleming, David Walliams, Michael G. Wilson, Lindy Hemming and Maryam d’Abo.

The
auction, which rasied funds for a range of charities including Unicef, 
is one of a series of events being held around the world to mark the 
anniversary of one of the world’s longest-running and most successful 
film franchises.

Forty lots were sold online between 
September 28 and October 8, while 10 of the star items were reserved for
the live auction that took place on October 5 - 'Global James Bond Day'
at Christie’s offices in South Kensington, London.

Michael
G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, Producers, EON Productions said: 'What 
better way to celebrate the 50 year anniversary than by supporting 
UNICEF and the eleven additional charities who will be benefitting from 
the auction items donated by the Bond archive and supporters.

'The generosity and dedication of Bond fans will enable the charitable organisations to continue their good work. Many thanks.'
