Nearly three million children in Syria are absent from the classroom as the devastating effects of the civil war take their toll on the country's education system, a new report today revealed.

A fifth of schools have been bombed, damaged, transformed into shelters and military barracks, as war rages into its fourth year, Unicef said.

Nearly half of Syria's school-age children have been prevented from studying, the UN children's agency said.

Unicef: A new report by the UN's children's agency has revealed nearly three million Syrian children are absent from the classroom as the civil war takes its toll on youngsters, leaving them unable to go to school. This group of children are pictured today playing in the town of Azaz, near the Syrian-Turkish border

Vast change: Prior to the civil war, primary school enrollment had been almost universal for a generation, the report states. Literacy rates were more than 90 per cent and the country was investing five per cent of its annual GDP on national learning

Scarred: Hamida Lasseko, Unicef's deputy representative in Syria's capital Damascus, said: 'When one says that it is the worst place to be as a child, in Syria, for now, I would agree. Children are missing from education, they are out of school. Children have the hidden wounds, and these wounds form scars'

The majority of the 2.3million Syrian 
children who should be in classes remain within the country's borders 
but are unable to attend school as education and health services have 
collapsed.

The new report, titled Under Siege: The Devastating Impact On Children Of Three Years Of Conflict In Syria, shows the wide-reaching effects of the conflict and the impact it is having on the country's youngest victims.

In total, 40 per cent of all school-age children in Syria are out of school, the report said.

Agency officials in Geneva said another 300,000 Syrian children are out of school in Lebanon, along with 93,000 in Jordan, 78,000 in Turkey, 26,000 in Iraq and 4,000 in Egypt.

Prior to the civil war, primary school enrollment had been almost universal for a generation, the report states.

Literacy rates were more than 90 per cent and the country was investing five per cent of its annual GDP on national learning.

But during the course of the conflict, that investment has been all but wiped out.

Many
 teachers no longer turn up for work as nearly a fifth of the country's 
schools have been destroyed, damaged, turned into shelters, or taken 
over by armed groups and forces.

'When one says that it is the worst place to be as a child, in Syria, for now, I would agree,' said Hamida Lasseko, Unicef's deputy representative in Syria's capital Damascus.

'Children are missing from education, they are out of school. Children have the hidden wounds, and these wounds form scars.'

Report: The study reveals 40 per cent of all school-age Syrian children are unable to go to school as nearly a fifth of all classrooms have been bombed and damaged or transformed into shelters or military barracks. These children are pictured in the doorway of their tent shelter, in the Bab Al Salame camp for internally displaced persons, near the border with Turkey

Support: Unicef has estimated that two million children affected by the fighting are in need of psychological support or treatment

The report states: '"I used to want to be a teacher,' 
Hassan, said as he tended to a fire outside his family's tent in 
Lenanon's Beka'a valley. 'But where are the schools to learn or teach in
 now?'

'Shaza, 15, used to live in Aleppo. She said: "Many buildings, including schools, were attacked and burned down. Children were not allowed to walk outside freely since many snipers weres shooting every day. Security was getting worse day by day, and violence was part of our daily life."'

Unicef estimates two million children affected by the fighting are in need of psychological support or treatment.

For Syrian children living in refugee camps, the chance to learn is scarce.

Half of all refugee school-age youngsters are not in school.

Children
 fight for spaces in classes in their new home, while families struggle 
to cover the cost of school books, tuition and transport.

Children struggle to understand classes in languages they are not familiar with.

But
 many families face the hurdle of not having the correct papers to 
enroll their children in schools in countries that have become their new
 homes.

Poor diets are also having an impact, leaving children struggling to concentrate as they battle extreme hunger.

Thousands
 have lost limbs, parents, teachers, schools, homes and virtually every 
aspect of their childhood, according to agency officials.

And
 they are the ones lucky enough to be alive. More than 10,000 children 
have been killed in the violence, the agency said, and 1.2 million are 
now refugees living in camps and overwhelmed neighbouring communities 
where clean water, food and other basic items are scarce.

Overall, the number of children suffering from the civil war has more than doubled to 5.5 million in the past 12 months alone, Unicef said.

Many are forced to grow up fast. One in 10 refugee child is now working, the agency estimates, while one in five Syrian girls in Jordan is forced into early marriage.

The report, reveals that by the end of January this year, 37,498 Syrian children had been born as refugees.

A Unicef blog states: 'Every child touched by this conflict has experienced things no child should.'Fear has become as way of life and the past three years has left too many with deep developmental and emotional scars.

'The children of Syria cannot afford 
another year of conflict. The coming months are our last chance to save a
 generation that will otherwise be lost.

'They need our support to 
grow, learn and develop the skills that will rebuild their war-ravaged 
country and restore its diverse and multicultural society.'

More than six million people have been displaced within the country, meaning a third of all Syrian children are no longer living in their own homes or communities.

Refugees: Syrian children attending a Unicef supported tented school at Kawergosik Refugee Camp in Iraq. But for those living in camps, it is just as hard to attend classes. Half of school-age children in refugee camps are absent from school, as parents face barriers, including securing their children places
