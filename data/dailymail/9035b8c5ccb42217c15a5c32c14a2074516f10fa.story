An 11-year-old boy found chained to a porch with a dead chicken tied around his neck last month had previously been cut across the face and burned with electrical wires by his foster father, according to an indictment.

Authorities responding to a nearby call discovered the boy on the porch in Monroe, North Carolina on November 15, and his foster parents, Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Harper, were arrested.

The couple have now been indicted on child abuse charges and an indictment returned by a grand jury in Superior Court on Monday reveals shocking new details in the case.

The couple, a former social services worker and her boyfriend, had legal guardianship of the boy and the indictment claims they heaped abuse on him between August and November.

Accused: Dorian Harper, left, and Wanda Sue Larson, right, have been indicted on child abuse charges after a boy in their care was found chained to their porch with a chicken tied around his neck

The document says the boy was chained to a piece of railroad in his room and once, when he tried to escape, he broke his wrist, the Charlotte Observer reported.

In another grisly incident, Haper allegedly cut the child's face with a knife and left a two-inch scar. He also allegedly used an electrical wire to burn the boy's face near his eye.

They also allegedly stabled the boy's finger and left it permanently damaged, while another assault by the couple left him with a severe cut between his fingers that became infected.

The child was never taken to the hospital for his injuries, the indictment said.

Harper and Larson now face a combined 21 charges, including several counts of felony child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon and maiming.

Cruel: As well as the bizarre chicken incident, the indictment claims the boy suffered cuts and burns to his face. It states that he also broke his wrist and never received medical attention for the injuries

When the boy was found in freezing 
conditions, his leg had been chained to the porch railing with a pair of
handcuffs and the dead chicken was tied around his neck with twine.

The deputy who found him approached the house and was 
confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for Harper's identification and 
an explanation as to why the child was handcuffed to the porch.

According to WBTV, one of the children
opened the front door, releasing several large dogs who attacked the 
deputy. By the time he had the dogs under control, Harper had removed 
the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front 
of the house.

Other officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal investigation was opened.

It is unclear what prompted the use of the dead chicken and handcuffs on the boy, but one of the boy's older brothers previously suggested the child had psychological issues and had likely mistreated the animal before the incident.

Larson, who worked as a child protective services supervisor for Union County, was also indicted for willful failure to discharge her duty as a public figure.

Harper was an emergency room nurse at Carolinas Medical Center-Union and has also lost his job.

The couple were also indicted for cruelty to animals for allegedly failing to feed their Basset hound enough and have both been placed on bond of $500,000 each.

Five children ages 7 to 14, all of whom were adopted, were taken from the home after the arrests, and they remain under the care of Davidson County DSS.
