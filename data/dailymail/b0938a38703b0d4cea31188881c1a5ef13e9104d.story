If Louis van Gaal had sat down with that clipboard of his and sketched out the perfect scenario for his new-look Manchester United, he could not have planned it any better than Sunday’s win over QPR.

A spectacular Old Trafford introduction for record £60million signing Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera’s first goal in a United shirt and hugely impressive debuts from Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo meant that Van Gaal had the luxury of sending on Radamel Falcao with his team 4-0 up and in cruise control.

The surge of optimism around Old Trafford was palpable. After the slide into mediocrity under David Moyes and a worryingly slow start to Van Gaal’s reign, here was evidence of a complete transformation.

If there is one problem for the Dutchman, and it has become a recurring theme in recent weeks, it is how he accommodates his Gaal-acticos.

The man who appeared to be most under threat in the new order was Juan Mata. Many people saw the £37m signing of the Spaniard in January as a panic buy. Some still do. Certainly the way he was shunted around the pitch under Moyes suggested that little forethought had gone into the move.

Ryan Giggs dropped Mata for his first game in temporary charge at the end of last season and Van Gaal was certainly under no obligation to find room for the former Chelsea man when he took over. With the new manager looking to inject more pace into the team, it was suggested that Mata might actually slow United down.

Four games into the new season, and it would appear that he has an integral role to play at No 10.

Mata’s goal against QPR on Sunday was his eighth in the last 10 Premier League games, quite some record for a player who is essentially out there to provide assists.

The way he linked up with Di Maria, Herrera and Blind at the top of the midfield diamond was central to United’s game plan, and may continue to be so even when Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini return from injury to give the manager an even bigger selection quandary.

Mata's form - he has scored eight goals in 10 Premier League games - puts Van Persie's place under threat

Juan Mata - Eight goals in last 10 Premier League matches

Robin van Persie - Two goals in last 10 Premier League matches 

So who will be the odd man out among United’s big names? On current form, the player most under threat would appear to be Robin van Persie.

Amid the wave of euphoria on Sunday, it was overlooked that the Dutchman did not actually play very well. In fact, he has not played particularly well for United for some time.

The man credited with tipping the title balance in United’s favour after he arrived from Arsenal two years ago, faded under Moyes last season. The highlight, a Champions League hat-trick against Olympiacos, was followed by news that he would miss six weeks with a knee injury.

It was not enough to prevent Van Persie from playing for Van Gaal at the World Cup and scoring that spectacular diving header against Spain in the opening game, but earlier this month he was forced to deny rumours that he will need surgery to cure his knee after United moved to sign Falcao.

Louis van Gaal has a big decision to make as to whether he should keep Van Persie in his starting XI

Certainly his form in the early part of the new season has failed to dispel concerns that he is still struggling with the problem.

On Sunday, Van Persie posed very little threat apart from one moment in the second half when he was played in by a quite wonderful flick from Di Maria. He chose to hit it first time rather than take the ball down and beat Rob Green, and normally you would have backed him to bury it. Instead he snatched at it and fired straight at the QPR keeper. It was only one moment, but it seemed to sum up Van Persie at present.

When Van Gaal was confirmed as United’s new manager in May, it was assumed that his fellow Dutchman would be an automatic choice for a first-team place - if not the captaincy as well. That honour went to Wayne Rooney, of course, and now Van Persie finds himself in serious danger of being squeezed out of the line-up altogether.

When Falcao is fully fit and ready to start, something will have to give. Rooney could drop into midfield in place of Mata, or Van Gaal could switch his formation again. That is unlikely, however, and Van Persie has every reason to be worried
