A female police officer has been nicknamed 'Robocop' after continuing to chase suspects despite being shot - twice.

Ann Marie Carrizales was shot in the face and chest from close-range during a routine traffic stop.

Despite her injuries, she chased the car and assisted in the arrest of the alleged gunman.

After being shot she returned fire, blasting out of the rear window of the car containing the alleged gunman and two suspects.

The mother of two is recovering at home after being released from hospital.

Her life was saved, according to police chiefs, by her bullet-proof vest.

'Her ballistic vest stopped almost 
all the shot to the chest, some minor injuries there,' said police 
spokesman Dustin Claborn said.

'Without a doubt, it saved her life. It just illustrates how quickly something can go bad for any officer at any time.'

The incident occurred in near Houston, Texas, United states, at around 3.30am on Saturday.

Ms Carrizales, a former marine, pulled over a car with three people in it before being shot.

'I think it speaks highly of her character, her fortitude,' said police spokesman Dustin Claborn.

Members of the Stafford Police Department have called her 'Robocop' in reference to the film character.

After continuing the chase, other police units joined her and the suspects were cornered in an apartment complex.

Sergio Francisco Rodriguez, who allegedly fired the shots, was located and taken into custody by Missouri City police officers.

Rodriguez is charged with aggravated assault on an officer and was being held without bond Saturday night.  

An active warrant for aggravated assault on a peace officer has been issued for the driver, 28-year-old Freddy Henriquez. 

Police said Henriquez should be considered armed and dangerous.

He is also reportedly a Honduras native wanted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for illegally re-entering the United States as a violent felon. 

According to ICE, Henriquez is believed to be a member of a violent gang called Sureno 13 - a prison gang affiliated with the Mexican Mafia. 

Investigators are working to identify the third suspect.

Carrizales was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital and was released Saturday night.
