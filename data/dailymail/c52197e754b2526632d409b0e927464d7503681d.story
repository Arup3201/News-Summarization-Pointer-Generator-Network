Andy Carroll has finally been enjoying regular playing time after overcoming his injury problems with Premier League high-flyers West Ham.

But away from Upton Park, there are plenty of Twitter users who think he still has a lot of work to do.

Carroll, 25, and his pregnant fiancée Billi Mucklow, 26, have been sharing pictures of their new Essex home, dubbed Carroll Castle.

And Carroll received plenty of flack from his fans after posing in a living room with zebra print wallpaper, matching cushions, black fur rug and glass coffee table. 

'Bruv, why did you let her have a pink sofa?' bemused one Instagram user, while another described the couple's living room as 'the worst room ever'. 

Carroll Castle also has a fully-functioning beauty salon, a surprise gift from Carroll to his fiancée, who used to appear in TOWIE.

The couple welcomed family to their  home for Christmas, laying on what appeared to be a festive buffet in a sun-drenched conservatory.

Later the party descended to the disco era, with pink and purple lights flying around the room as bottles of wine, flowers and candles littered the table.

On Thursday, it was claimed Mr Carroll had been duped out of thousands of pounds by a fraudster purporting to sell Fortnum & Mason hampers and Harrods champagne.

A con-artist was said to have targeted the West Ham player and his manager Sam Allardyce at the team's Essex training grounds, offering cut-priced goods which were never delivered once allegedly paid for. 

A Metropolitan Police spokesman told MailOnline the force was investigating reports of fraud in Norwich City, another club said to have been targeted, but that no arrests had been made. 

Mr Carroll however denied being caught in the scam, as first reported by the Sun, tweeting: 'My money is safe'.
