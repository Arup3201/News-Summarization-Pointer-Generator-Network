Labour leader Ed Miliband tonight faces revolt from his English MPs over his refusal to bar Scottish MPs from voting on policies which only apply south of the border.

Former Cabinet ministers Ben Bradshaw and John Denham have formed a new group dubbed English Labour to challenge the party leadership's refusal to admit it is 'unfair' for Scots to vote on English matters.

Mr Miliband is under pressure for refusing to back home rule for England, and David Cameron said it should form part of the response to Scotland rejecting independence in last week's referendum.

The Labour leadership is struggling to hold the line on the English votes issue, insisting it could 'drive our country apart'.

Mr Cameron has said reform at the Commons should be carried out 'in tandem' with the further devolution to Holyrood promised by the leaders of the three main Westminster parties in the final days of the referendum campaign.

Mr Miliband's chances of being able to form a Commons majority after the next general election are likely to depend on the votes of Scottish MPs.

He has called for constitutional convention to consider wider issues of reform, and was asked 13 times by the BBC's Andrew Marr whether he backed the idea of 'English votes for English laws', but refused to give a direct answer. 

To add to the sense of confusion, Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman tonight told LBC: 'We do have to recognise there's an anomaly and look at different ways we can address that.'

Now it has emerged that Labour MPs in England have formed a rebel bloc to challenge the leadership. 

Former Culture Secretary Mr Bradshaw told the Western Morning News: 'Our leadership has to be much clearer that there's a problem that needs addressing.

'They've very good at talking about devolution, they're very good at talking about powers to communities and local government.

'We need to be absolutely crystal clear there is an imbalance and unfairness in our constitutional settlement.'

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Labour leader Ed Miliband have refused to say it is unfair for Scots to vote on policies which do not affect their constituencies 

William Hague, the Leader of the House of Commons, said English votes for English laws 'could not be avoided'

Commons leader William Hague tonight fired a warning at Labour that banning Scottish MPs from voting on English laws 'cannot now be avoided'.

The former Foreign Secretary, emerging from a summit with Tory MPs at the Prime Minister's countryside retreat at Chequers, said 'English votes for English laws' was 'something we have to face up to' in the wake of the Scottish independence referendum.

He said handing more devolved powers to Holyrood had to go hand in hand with less Scottish influence over English laws.

But Mr Hague held out an olive branch to the Labour Party – insisting that it would be prepared to hold talks on the issue in the coming weeks.

He said: 'We will be open to discussions - of course we will be - with the Labour Party and other parties as well.'

However he stressed that the issue had to be dealt with and that if the Westminster parties - including the Liberal Democrats - could not reach agreement they would have to set out their rival positions at the general election in May.

He said: 'This issue of fairness for England - as well as for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - I think is one that cannot now be avoided. That is now something we have to face up to.

'It has been discussed for a very long time. The time has now come to make some decisions about this.'

Mr Bradshaw, who attended the inaugural meeting of the English Labour Party, with MPs, council leaders and representatives of the church and civic leaders, added: 'We have to acknowledge an unfairness where Scottish MPs vote on exclusively English matters. The question as to whether this is unfair has to be a 'yes'.'

However, today shadow chancellor Ed Balls dodged questions about whether the system is fair six times.

He told BBC Radio 4 only that he wanted a 'fairer' solution to the problem, but said: 'I think David Cameron is just trying to dupe people with an idea that he's got some easy, quick political fix which him and William Hague and George Osborne sorted out.

'You can't play political games with our constitution. I want fairness, but I'm not going to say there's an easy and fair solution to the question you're raising.'

He continued that the Prime Minister was 'playing fast and loose with the whole of our Union'.

Speaking at a fringe event in Manchester, Labour MP Simon Danczuk said Mr Miliband has to come out with substantial 'road map' to English devolution or he's in 'real trouble'.

He added: 'If he doesn't address it tomorrow then he's got a real problem...then we are really on the back foot.

'Why we couldn't have had a good offer ready...just beggar's belief in my opinion.'

Meanwhile Mr Denham, a former Communities Secretary, said the offer more powers to Scotland had to mean more autonomy for England too.

He told The Telegraph: 'I think there's no doubt England needs to decide what it wants and that means you have to find a way that laws just affecting England have the consent of English MPs.

'So I don't have a problem with the principle that [says] as the powers of the Scottish Parliament increase the role of Scottish MPs in English affairs is bound to decrease.'

London Mayor Boris Johnson said proposals to hand sweeping new powers to Edinburgh were being introduced at a 'blisteringly fast' pace - despite claims by Scottish nationalists that Westminster was 'reneging' on its campaign promises.

But he warned that the 'basic unfairness' of allowing Scottish MPs to vote on legislation which does not apply north of the border needed addressing.

He said this 'can be done while keeping the Union together', but added: 'It is just bonkers to say that it can be done overnight.' 

Prime Minister David Cameron Mr Cameron said the 'English votes for English laws' measure should be introduced 'in tandem' with handing new powers to Holyrood.

The PM today held talks with senior backbenchers at his official country retreat, Chequers, to win support for his proposal.
