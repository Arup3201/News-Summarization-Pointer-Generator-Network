Dashcam footage shows the dramatic moment police officers finally stopped a bank robber on a Michigan highway after the wanted man stabbed himself behind the wheel.

The video, which was shared with the Kalamazoo Gazette, reveals Michigan State Police trailing Brian Standiford, 49, at low speeds before one of their trucks knocks the side of his car to force him off I-94.

After one failed attempt that sent Standiford's car spinning, the truck knocks him again, forcing him into a snow bank. As police approach, he raises his hands out of the window.

Before the scene captured on video on January 13, Standiford had allegedly robbed an Old National Bank in Portage but was forced to run after a dye pack exploded.

Taking chase: Michigan State Police can be seen trailing a white car driven by robbery suspect Brian Standiford after he allegedly held up a bank in Portage, Michigan on January 13

Knock: After Standiford failed to stop after driving over spike strips so the trooper knocked his car, sending him into a snowbank. Officers had feared he would crash in a more populated area

Police spotted him driving his getaway car and following him onto I-94, where they set up spike strips near Exit 60 to Paw Paw.

But after he hit the strips, which deflated his wheels, he continued his slow-moving getaway. Also after hitting the strips, he pulled out a knife and attempted to stab himself in the chest, police said.

Worried that Standiford would continue driving and crash into a busier area, troopers decided to knock his car in an effort to stop him. 

When they did, they discovered the knife inside the car.

As well as the bank robbery before the pursuit on January 13, Standiford was wanted in connection with a January 5 armed robbery at a Chemical Bank branch in Oshtemo Township, Mlive reported. 

Surrendered: He can be seen putting his hands up outside the car after being stopped by troopers

Stopped: Officers then arrested him and found he had tried to stab himself inside the moving car

Arrest: He was taken into custody and charged in connection with two bank robberies

He has now been charged with two counts of bank robbery and one count of fleeing and eluding police. 

He is also suspected in a January 12 armed robbery at a Consumers Credit Union branch in South Haven, though no charges have been brought in that incident.

But it's far from his first brush with the law. 

According to the Indiana State Prison Offender database, Standiford spent time in prison for a string of robberies in 1992, Mlive reported.

Then in 1993, he pleaded guilty to robbing two banks and several stores to feed his drug habit, the Times of Northwest Indiana reported. 

In custody: The 49-year-old has a long history of bank robberies and previously served time in Indiana

During that time, he earned the nickname 'The Big Bandit' in the 1990s for his size and for his regular holdups.

Then in March 1997, he was arrested while on drugs following three bank robberies in northwest Indiana. He pleaded guilty and was sent to prison for stealing a total of $15,848 over three days. 

He is due in Kalamazoo County District Court on Wednesday for hearings for the January 5 and January 13 robberies.
