Every transfer window, clubs scramble to pick up the best bargains, and fans argue over who their side really need. 

But, seven months after last summer's window swung shut,which of those deals have proved to be value for money?

As we reach the business end of the season, now is the time for the men brought in to start really showing their worth. 

But who have been the best signings of the season so far? Sportsmail takes a look... 

10 - ANDER HERRERA

Athletic Bilbao to Manchester United

Well, he finally became a hit after being allowed to play consistently. Makes Manchester United tick, has an eye for a pass and gets himself involved in the final third, making sure the main striker doesn’t have to come searching for possession.

It’s a mystery why Louis van Gaal didn’t fancy the former Athletic Bilbao midfielder to begin with, but he has really made his mark since enjoying a real run in the team.

They do love a classy caresser of a ball at Old Trafford, which clearly works in his favour.

9 - DARYL JANMAAT

Feyenoord to Newcastle United

Mr Dependable, which is a name you do not normally associate with Newcastle defenders. 

It is baffling that Van Gaal - who must have known he needed a right back on arriving at Manchester United - did not feel the need to sign a player he started in every World Cup fixture for Holland.

Cheap and pleased for the opportunity in the Premier League, Alan Pardew and Graham Carr did their homework on this signing and it’s helped no end at the back for the Magpies.

Daryl Janmaat has proved excellent value for Newcastle, becoming a regular at right back in his first season

Janmaat is a Dutch international star, and Newcastle did well to pick him up for such a small fee last summer

8 - TOBY ALDERWEIRELD

Atletico Madrid to Southampton (loan)

Nine clean sheets for Southampton with the Belgian defender in the team and - despite him making noises that he probably won’t be around next season - they have easily coped with the loss od Dejan Lovren to Liverpool.

Quick enough for the Premier League, he’s kept up with the best and added a touch of class at the back for Saints.

7 - RYAN BERTRAND

Chelsea to Southampton (loan and then permanent)

Luke Shaw’s boots may be small in a literal sense, but figuratively Bertrand had a job on.

Southampton were smarting at losing their teenage sensation who careered down the left last season, but it’s as if he was never really there as the former Chelsea man carries equal threat going forward and has actually appeared more comfortable defensively.

What good business it was then to get Bertrand snapped up on a permanent deal in January.

Ryan Bertrand and Nathaniel Clyne have been inspirational at full backs for Southampton this season

After signing him on loan in the summer, securing Bertrand permanently looks like a masterstroke

6 - GRAZIANO PELLE

Feyenoord to Southampton

A fairly unknown quantity on signing from Feyenoord for £8m, Pelle’s physical presence and deftness of touch has made him a huge hit on the south coast.

Important goals and some panache to go with it, the Italian has earned his first international call-up while on Ronald Koeman’s watch and carries a severe threat inside the 18-yard box.

Even after his goals have dried up somewhat, Graziano Pelle' strength and quality have been a major asset

Pelle's goalscoring start to the season earned him his first Italian caps, and he scored on his debut

5 - MAME BIRAM DIOUF

Free agent to Stoke City

A deceptively effective forward, and terrific value for money for free. Diouf struggled at Blackburn but redefined himself in the Bundesliga with Hannover and has taken that goalscoring form to the Potteries. 

Scoring more than one in every three starts, the Senegalese has chipped in with crucial goals for Stoke and has been a relatively unsung hero this year.

Edges out Southampton’s Sadio Mane in this list based on the respective transfer fees (Mane cost £11.8m) and amount of chances their sides create.

4 - DIAFRA SAKHO

Metz to West Ham United

Has suffered a couple of injuries, but that hasn’t had any lasting effect on his impact at Upton Park in a debut season.

Sniffs out goals from nowhere and has that low centre of gravity which has defenders quaking. Strong in the air and with his back to goal, Sakho brings others into play as well as netting on a regular basis.

Had he not come back from international duty injured, the Senegalese might have been pushing Harry Kane and Costa for the golden boot.

3 - DIEGO COSTA

Atletico Madrid to Chelsea

That blistering start to the season means Costa will be in every list similar to this from now until May. His 19 Premier League goals are one of the chief reasons why Chelsea look like winning the title.

But it’s not all about hitting the back of the net - fans at Stamford Bridge have also bought into his style of play. 

The Spain international bullies defenders, shakes their confidence and is fairly nasty. Proper Chelsea.

Diego Costa has endeared himself to Chelsea fans with his nasty side, showing aggression as well as quality

Costa's 19 Premier League goals already have fired Chelsea to the brink of the title 

2 - CESC FABREGAS

Barcelona to Chelsea

Where would Costa have been without Fabregas? Back in the capital, albeit over the other side, his campaign got off to a similarly stunning start, assisting almost at will as Chelsea battered all those put in front of them.

Yes, there is an argument to suggest his form has dipped, but Fabregas is worthy of making the list because of that reintroduction to English football.

You get the sense he could move through the gears if necessary, too.

Providing more assists than any other player by far, Cesc Fabregas' Premier League return has been superb

His form may have dropped off since the turn of the year, but Fabregas has still been a stand-out star

Offering more defensively than at previous clubs, Fabregas has become the complete midfielder this season

1 - ALEXIS SANCHEZ

Barcelona to Arsenal

A game-changer. Someone who is capable of turning no points into three and putting opposition to the sword. Fierce in possession, his burst of pace can unlock defences in a flash.

Not happy playing second fiddle to Neymar and Lionel Messi at Barcelona, Sanchez has proven this term that he is one of the premier forwards in world football and shown to Arsene Wenger why it’s probably wise to shell out on quality every now and again.
