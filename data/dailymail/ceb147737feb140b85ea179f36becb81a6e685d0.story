Louis van Gaal, Wayne Rooney and Angel di Maria were mocked up as 'Only Fools and Man United' on T-shirts outside White Hart Lane as even Tottenham's merchandise vendors began poking fun at their Premier League rivals.

A famous quote from the cult BBC comedy was also twisted, with it instead reading: 'This time next year, we'll be champions'.

The shop owners were clearly trying to cash in on United's plight ahead of their Capital One Cup clash with Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night.

Man United mock up T shirts made outside White Hart Lane were based on BBC Comedy Only Fools and Horses

Louis van Gaal has struggled to pick up results at the start of his Manchester United tenure

Angel di Maria was signed for a record £60m as the Old Trafford club made the Argentinian a marquee signing

Rooney was made Man United captain by Van Gaal and has been tasked with turning their fortunes around

The caption printed on the shirts comes from Del Boy and Rodney Trotters' misguided belief that one day, they would be millionaires.

Van Gaal and Co may just get the last laugh though, as that eventually came true!

Spurs beat Forest 3-1 to advance to the last 16, while United were knocked out in the second round by MK Dons, losing 4-0.
