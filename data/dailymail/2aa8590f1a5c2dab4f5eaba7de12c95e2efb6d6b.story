FIFA president Sepp Blatter has caused yet another storm by committing the world football body to the multi-million-pound funding of a film that is regarded as little more than a giant vanity project.

United Passions, which was launched with Blatter in attendance at the Cannes film festival  yesterday, tells the history of FIFA through founder Jules Rimet, played by Gerard Depardieu, Joao Havelange and Blatter himself — who is depicted by Tim Roth.

It is understood the film, which has received a lukewarm reaction, cost £19million to make, of which FIFA paid £16million, although a Zurich source claimed it was only half that amount — but still a huge investment.

There is great angst within FIFA that Blatter made the personal decision to commit to such a vast spend after being strongly advised to steer well clear of the proposed film — brought to his attention by Algeria’s FIFA executive member Mohamed Raouraoua.

It is North African sources who are adamant that Blatter has bankrolled at least  85 per cent of the movie, which is expected to be a box-office flop.

Once involved, Blatter was very hands-on in the production. Having seen an original draft back in March, the FIFA president demanded a number of changes, including him lecturing the FIFA marketing department, as opposed to the FIFA executive, on rooting out corruption after his first election in 1998.

Blatter is expected to be unopposed when he stands for a fifth term at the annual Congress in Sao Paulo at the start of June.

BBC SPORT, whose guidelines over TV and radio talent working elsewhere are never clear — especially with many being freelance — have interfered in cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew’s dealings with Waitrose.

A Waitrose promotion of Agnew giving a cricket-style commentary on Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson going around the supermarket was removed from YouTube on BBC orders.

Agnew, who admits it was his mistake, believed the promo was meant for a Waitrose audience only. A BBC spokeswoman said: ‘In light of Waitrose’s new sponsorship of English cricket, Jonathan is reviewing his relationship with the Waitrose magazine and will stop writing the column for the time being.’

In his last Waitrose column on cricket, Agnew was highly critical of the ECB.

Hammers Cup blunder

West Ham co-owner David Gold is inviting four members of the club’s 1964 FA Cup-winning side to be his personal guests in the directors’ box for the first home game of next season.

This follows upset over the botched West  Ham arrangements to fete Ken Brown, Eddie Bovington, Peter Brabrook and Ronnie Boyce on the 50th anniversary of the Wembley triumph last month.

The quartet, who had to queue for a  buffet meal and pay for their own drinks, were given seats in the back rows of the top tier in the main stand for the match against Crystal Palace and left before the end.

Brabrook’s daughter, Donna O’Fallon, said: ‘I still cannot believe they were put in the skies.’

Fulham owner Shahid Khan may be a billionaire, but he has responded to his first season ending in relegation from the Premier League by demanding that £1million in cuts are made among the administrative staff rather than the under-performing players.

Everyone outside the football squad from chief executive Alistair Mackintosh downwards are involved in a voluntary redundancy exercise before the axe starts to fall on what will be numerous personnel at Craven Cottage.

It has emerged that the personal assistant employed by beleaguered Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore before whistleblower Rani Abraham’s temporary stint, only lasted a few weeks at Gloucester Place as well.

Paola Nyderek, who has also worked at Sky in a PA role, spent just four weeks as Scudamore’s assistant before leaving. She signed a confidentiality clause on departure, which the PL describe as common practice for someone who had access to confidential business material.
