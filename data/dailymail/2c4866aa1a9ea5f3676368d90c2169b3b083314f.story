Cleaners working on an aircraft in eastern India have found 24 gold bars worth more than £620,000 hidden in a toilet compartment - the latest in a series of smuggling attempts uncovered at the country's airports.

The cleaners had boarded the Jet Airways plane at Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) airport on Tuesday after it had travelled from the eastern city of Patna.

It had earlier been flying on international routes that included the Middle East.

The cleaners' discovery is the latest evidence of a growing smuggler trade which takes advantage of India's customs laws

Smugglers have been using a loophole in India's flight schedules to attempt getting gold into the country without having to declare it to customs officials.

The gold is secretly stashed in an aircraft toilet at its international point of departure, where it remains when the plane lands at an Indian city.

Because that particular aircraft is then used to continue on as a domestic flight, a new passenger picks up the gold on the domestic leg and leaves the plane when it lands, knowing that there will be no customs checks.

India, which rivals China as the world's biggest gold consumer, has seen a rise in smuggling after import duties were increased three times this year to try to dampen demand for the precious metal.

Just last month an aircraft cleaning crew found 280 gold bars worth £1.17 million inside a plane's toilet after it flew from Dubai to the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka.

Custom officials and police were aware 
that the gold had been hidden on the jet, operated by discount airline 
Flydubai, and the smuggler panicked and left the bars in the toilet.

Earlier in the year, police in Bangladesh said, there had been 'scores' of discoveries of gold on planes after couriers had decided the smuggling operation might have been discovered.

Chennai Airport was also the scene of drama last month when 32kg of gold bars were found hidden in the toilet of a plane that had started out in Dubai.

And when yet more abandoned gold was found on a plane that had set out from Dubai, landed in Mumbai then continued on to Goa, an Indian intelligence official explained how the system was being operated.

'In the case of the Dubai-Mumbai-Goa flight, a carrier boarded in Dubai and mid-air concealed the gold in the toilet behind the closet.

'The plan was for another passenger to board the flight in Mumbai, remove the gold mid-air and clear it at Goa without customs examination because by then it was a domestic sector.

'These smugglers travel business class since the number of passengers is less and the toilet is mostly unusued. They get down at Mumbai, leaving the goods behind.

'Another passenger then books a business class Mumbai-Goa ticket and takes out the goods mid-air and clears it in the domestic sector without customs examination.'
