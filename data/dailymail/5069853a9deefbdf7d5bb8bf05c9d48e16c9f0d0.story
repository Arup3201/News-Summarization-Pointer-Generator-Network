It is as dangerous as it is infuriating - and half of us are guilty of doing it.

A new study has revealed the M1 near Leeds as the worst spot in the nation for tailgating and a remarkable 49 per cent of drivers to be driving too close to the vehicle in front.

The M1 near Leeds and four different sections of the M42 have featured prominently on the top 10 list of the worst stretches of motorway for tailgating incidents.

The study revealed tailgating accidents cost us up to £129 million and kill five people every year

In second and third place respectively 
were a section of the M42 near Solihull, West Midlands, and the M1 near 
Brent Cross in north-west London.

Using traffic flow data from 6,500 
different sites, the Direct Line Insurance study identified hotspots 
across the country's motorway network where tailgaters are most active 
and result in the most accidents.

More than 1,700 injuries on Highways 
Agency roads are caused by tailgating, which is costing us £129m and claiming five lives a year.

1. M1 at A1M to J47 south - Leeds

2. M42 J6-7 north - Solihull

3. M1 within J1 north - Brent Cross, London

4. A1M J51-50 south - Leeming, North Yorkshire

5. M27 J7-5 west - Southampton

6. M42 J6-5 south - Solihull

7. M42 J4-3A south - Solihull/Redditch

8. M42 J7-6 south - Birmingham

9. A627M between start & J1 north - Oldham/Rochdale

10. M11 within J9 north - Bishops Stortford/Cambridge

The M42 takes four places on the top 10 list - with three sections near Solihull and one near Birmingham featuring on it.

It's recommended drivers keep a 
two-second gap between themselves and the vehicle in front. At a speed 
of 70mph, a two-second gap would equate to a distance of 62 metres.

Rob Miles, director of car insurance at Direct Line, said: 'All drivers have a responsibility to keep a safe distance between their vehicle and others on the road.

'Tailgating is extremely dangerous and also against the law, regardless of whether it’s done intentionally or in ignorance.

'Often people can find themselves too close to other vehicles on motorways as they rush to their destination or try to keep up with traffic flow.

'We’d urge drivers to keep their stopping distances in mind, as these are often forgotten in times of haste or frustration.

'Drivers should aim to always have at least a two-second gap – over 60 metres - between themselves and the car in front to keep safe on the motorway and avoid facing the on-the-spot fines for tailgating that were introduced last year.'

The M1 near Leeds is the nation's worst spot for tailgating and accidents involving vehicles travelling too close

In second place on the list was the M42 near Solihull. It was the first of four times the M42 featured on the list

In third place came the M1 again, with tailgating incidents very common near Brent Cross, north-west London

In August last year police clamped down on tailgating offending as part of a campaign targeting 'inconsiderate driving'.

New £100 spot fines were introduced to deal with the offence of 'careless driving' while police targeted those spotted tailgating, hogging the middle and outside motorway lanes or purposely driving on kerbs.

The new instant fine method of dealing with the offences is thought to be snaring about 200 motorists a week.
