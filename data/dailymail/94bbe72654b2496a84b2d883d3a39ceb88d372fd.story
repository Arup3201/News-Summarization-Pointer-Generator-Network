Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has denied claims that two artworks in its collection had originally been stolen by Nazis, with one of the pieces falling into the hands of the Gurlitt family.

The two works in question are an oil painting, Chancellor Buelow Speaking In The Reichstag, by Georg Waltenberger dated 1905, and a chalk lithography entitled Street In Koenigsberg by Lovis Corinth.

The discovery, by an art historian, is a new embarrassment for authorities who kept quiet for nearly two years about a huge stash of looted art which came to light last month.

A trove of 1,406 European artworks 
which included works by Picasso and Matisse were found at the Munich 
apartment of recluse Cornelius Gurlitt.

Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has denied claims that two artworks in its collection had originally been stolen by Nazis, with one of the pieces stolen to order by the Gurlitt family

Among the items in the Gurlitt hoard of Nazi loot are (clockwise from top left) Moorish Conversation on a Terrace by Eugene Delacroix; Riders on the Beach by Max Liebermann; Seated Woman/Woman Sitting in Armchair by Henri Matisse; Allegory/Allegorical Scene by Marc Chagall; and Study of a Woman Nude, Standing, Arms Raised, Hands Crossed Above Head by Auguste Rodin

The 80-year-old is the son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, an art dealer of part-Jewish descent who was ordered by Hitler to buy up so-called 'degenerate art' and sell it to raise funds for the Nazis.

The historian claims the Corinth piece was once part of the Gurlitt collection.

The Bundestag yesterday issued a statement saying an art historian was reviewing two 'suspicious cases' but a spokesman would not confirm the find.

The historian's investigations into the German parliament's art collection, which began in 2012, were continuing, the Bundestag spokesman said.

'It is unclear when there will be a result to the investigations,' he said.

Loot: American soldiers are pictured discovering one of Hildebrandt Gurlitt's enormous art stash during the war. Although they suspected him of dealing in Nazi art, they let him go

During World War Two, the Nazis looted Europe for all it was worth.

As they raided homes, SS soldiers would take valuables from the walls and bring them proudly back to their leader.

But in their hunt for priceless art, a new business began: bribing Jewish dealers.

Many
 of Europe's finest artworks were in the hands of Jewish brokers who had
 been making a living out of art consultancy for decades.

By
 1941, a trend started where people would force these dealers, fearing 
for their life, to give up classics by Matisse, Picasso, and Renoir for 
little to no money.

The bribers were often members of the regime with connections to transport links.

In
 exchange they would be offered safe passage to countries such as 
Britain - knowing senior Nazis would pay excessive amounts for their new
 purchase.

Last month, German authorities revealed that the Gurlitt hoard was valued at £1billion.

That collection had been held for decades by Cornelius Gurlitt

The
 legal status of the hoard is unclear. Gurlitt has demanded his art back
 and lawyers working on reclaiming property for heirs to Jewish 
collectors say he may get to keep at least some.

The Nazis plundered hundreds of thousands of artworks from museums and individuals across Europe.

An unknown number of works is still missing and museums around the world have conducted investigations into the origins of their exhibits.

The Bundestag's art collection comprises around 4,000 works and Bild said investigations had found some 108 pieces so far of unknown provenance.

About four years ago, it returned a portrait of former German chancellor Otto von Bismarck in a hat by Franz von Lenbach to its original owners after it was found to have been stolen by the Nazis.

The Central Council of Jews in Germany called for a list of the Bundestag's art works to be published.

'If the Bundestag is keeping lists of its collection secret, hindering the press in its investigations, protecting the perpetrators of Ayranisation and not informing the heirs, I would wish those responsible to show more sensibility and tact,' Council President Dieter Graumann told Bild.

Chagall, Dix, Picasso: The Gurlitt hoard

By ALLAN HALL, JILL REILLY, TOM KELLY

Some were believed to have been lost forever in the chaos and carnage of the Second World War.

Others were not even known about before.

They are among the 1,400 paintings found in the flat of recluse Cornelius Gurlitt.

Remarkable: A painting from Henry Matisse called Sitzende Frau (Sitting Woman) - one of the previously unknown works found at Gurlitt's flat - is projected on a screen during a news conference in Augsburg. It is worth an estimated £50-£60million

Treasure trove: An allegorical scene painting by Marc Chagall worth an estimated £15million had never been seen by the art world before emerging from Gurlitt's collection

The
 extraordinary cache, which includes unknown works by Marc Chagall, Otto
 Dix, Max Liebermann and Henri Matisse, was found when tax officials 
raided 80-year-old Gurlitt’s Munich apartment.

But the authorities kept secret their discovery for 20 months, and are refusing to publish details of the works.

Ruediger
 Mahlo, of the pressure group Conference on Jewish Material Claims 
against Germany, accused the authorities of ‘what amounts morally to the
 concealing of stolen goods’.

Collector: Hildebrandt Gurlitt amassed more than 1,500 masterpieces and ordered them to be destroyed in 1945

For some families missing art is the last personal effects of relatives murdered in the Holocaust.

Anne Webber, of the Commission for Looted Art in Europe, said the response of the German authorities was ‘troubling’. 

She
 said: ‘A list of these paintings must be published. There are hundreds 
of families around the world urgently wanting to know if any of the 
works belong to them.’

Reinhard
 Nemetz, head of the prosecutors’ office in Augsburg, said the works, 
which also included pieces by Canaletto, Courbet, Picasso and 
Toulouse-Lautrec, had been seized in March last year.

Most were in good condition.

Asked
 why the discovery had been kept secret for so long, he said: ‘It is for
 us counterproductive to go public with such a case. The investigations 
are costly, complex and lengthy.’

The
 collection also contained works by Picasso, Auguste Renoir, Henri de 
Toulouse-Lautrec, Max Beckmann, Max Liebermann, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner 
and Carl Spitzweg, he added.

Gurlitt vanished after the paintings 
were confiscated, with police suspecting that he has access to almost 
unlimited funds.

As well as selling The Lion Tamer, he sold off many of the paintings  - works that wouldn't attract headlines - before the 
intervention of German customs officials.

Gurlitt was a man of mystery in many aspects of his life.

The
 son of art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt, he did not have an official bank 
account, pension or insurance - he simply lived off the extensive 
collection, selling them when his money dipped.

He never held down a job and was not registered 
with the authorities - mandatory in Germany - and was not known to the tax authorities or social 
services.

The paintings thought to have been destroyed in the war were found hidden behind tins of rotting food in a shabby flat.

They
 had been taken from their owners, many of them Jewish, by the Nazis, 
who regarded the Impressionist, Cubist and Modernist pieces as 
‘degenerate’.

The story of 
their recovery begins one evening in September 2010 aboard a German 
Intercity Express train from Zurich in Switzerland to Munich.

Customs
 officials were carrying out a routine check on passengers – many 
wealthy Germans deposit money illegally in Switzerland to evade high tax
 rates at home – and asked for the papers of a white-haired man.

He
 proffered an Austrian passport in the name of Rolf Nikolaus Cornelius 
Gurlitt, born December 28, 1933, in Hamburg - currently residing in 
Salzburg.

‘He appeared nervous,’ said customs officials.

He said he had travelled to Switzerland for ‘business’ at the Galerie Kornfeld in Bern.

He
 then he pulled out an envelope with 9,000 euros in 500 euro notes 
inside – 1,000 euros under the legal limit which must declared to 
officials when crossing borders in Europe.

Gurlitt was allowed to go on his way, but the officials remained suspicious.

Extensive
 checks soon disclosed that he did not live in Salzburg but in 
Schwabing, and he was not registered with the authorities.

‘He was a man who didn’t exist,’ one official told Germany’s Focus magazine, which broke the story.

Control: Hitler only liked classical art and held exhibitions of modern 'dissident' pieces to show German people what not to like. Many of those paintings that appeared in those shows have been found in Gurlitt's collection

Investigators applied for a warrant to search behind the barred windows of his £600-a-month rented flat, eventually entering it in spring 2011.

There they discovered a mountain of tinned and bottled food, long past its sell-by date. Behind the decomposing food were the missing artworks.

Hildebrandt Gurlitt was an art dealer who in the run-up to the Second World War had been in charge of gathering up the so-called degenerate art for the Nazis.

Hildebrandt had bought for a pittance many of the paintings he seized, and they had passed to his son on his death. Cornelius then quietly sold a few, one at a time, to give him money to live on.

Investigators are working to reunite them with the families of their rightful owners.

One owner is already known.

A portrait of a woman by the French master Matisse belonged to the Jewish connoisseur Paul Rosenberg.

Rosenberg had to abandon his collection as he fled Paris when France fell to the Nazis in 1940.

His granddaughter Anne Sinclair, wife of disgraced former IMF bank chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has been fighting for decades for the return of her grandfather’s pictures, but is said to have not known of the existence of this painting.
