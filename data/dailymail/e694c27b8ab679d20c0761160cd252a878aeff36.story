North Korea's public officials are the most corrupt in the world with bribery, counterfeit medicine and backdoor payments just some of the consequences of its crooked institutions, according to a new study.

Experts have assessed the public sectors of countries across the globe and placed the authoritarian state dead last, tied with Somalia, when compared to the rest of the world.

The two countries both received their ranking of 174th - with eight points out of a possible 100 - after  factors of corruption within all countries were indexed.

In first place with the world's most honest officials was Denmark, on a score of 92, followed by New Zealand, which scored 91.

Because bribery and backdoor payments are by nature conducted in a clandestine manner, it remains impossible to accurately assess a country's level of corruption.

Instead, Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index assesses perceptions of corruption  across every country.

This includes public officials' accountability to the public, their likelihood to accept bribes or exploit their position for personal gain, and to what extent rogue officials are prosecuted by their country's justice system.

Britain was ranked 14th in the study, behind Europe's Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany.

Its total points tally was 78, showing an improvement of four points since 2012.

Across the Atlantic, the U.S. was ranked 17th on 74 points, trailing Canada by seven places but showing a vastly better score than every other country on its continent.

Many of the Central and South American states fared poorly, with Venezuela, Honduras and Haiti among the worst.

Jose Ugaz, the chair of Transparency International, said leading institutions in the U.S. and Europe needed to work with fast growing economies to hold the corrupt to account.

He said: 'Corrupt officials smuggle ill-gotten assets into safe havens through offshore companies with absolute impunity.

'Countries at the bottom need to adopt radical anti-corruption measures in favour of their people.

'Countries at the top of the index should make sure they don’t export corrupt practices to underdeveloped countries.'

In second place, one point behind Denmark, was New Zealand. Pictured is the view of Dunedin in the South Island

Mr Ugaz warned of the dire consequences of corruption, which he said included the denial of basic human rights and prevention of economic development.

'Grand corruption in big economies not only blocks basic human rights for the poorest but also creates governance problems and instability.

'Fast-growing economies whose governments refuse to be transparent and tolerate corruption, create a culture of impunity in which corruption thrives.'
