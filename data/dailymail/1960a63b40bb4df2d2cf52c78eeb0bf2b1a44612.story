At least 11 members of the same family were killed in an air strike on Gaza yesterday.

The attack came hours before the Israeli leadership announced it was prepared to ‘significantly expand’ its military operation.

The missile flattened the two-storey home of the Daloo family, leaving four children and five women, including an 80-year-old grandmother, among the dead.

The attack was the single deadliest 
incident of the five-day-old conflict and appeared to show that Israel 
was deliberately targeting the homes of senior Hamas officials in the 
Palestinian enclave.

Last night as rescuers continued to 
search the rubble for survivors, the Israeli military said the target of
 the attack was a rocket mastermind from the Islamic Jihad militant 
group.

But a health official in Gaza dismissed the accusation, claiming the men of the family were also civilians.

The blast damaged nearby buildings, injuring other women and children and leaving survivors screaming in grief.

The bodies of the children were later 
laid out in the morgue of Gaza City’s Shifa Hospital. The controversial 
operation brought the death toll in the Gaza Strip to 67 since the 
current round of hostilities began last Wednesday. Thirty-two of the 
dead were civilians. Three Israeli civilians have also died in the 
fighting.

There were growing fears last night that a ground invasion of Gaza was imminent, despite efforts to broker a ceasefire.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu raised the possibility of an invasion by saying: ‘The Israeli 
military is prepared to significantly expand the operation.’

He said Israeli soldiers ‘are ready 
for any activity that could take place’, adding: ‘We are exacting a 
heavy price from Hamas and terrorist organisations.’

Israeli tank battalions remain poised 
on the border with Gaza, while 30,000 soldiers and 75,000 army 
reservists have been called up. More than 500 Egyptian supporters 
crossed into Gaza last night to show their solidarity with the 
Palestinians.

Israeli Defence Forces spokesman 
Lieutenant Colonel Avital Leibovich said no decision on a ground 
offensive has been made yet but confirmed it is ‘still an option’.

‘We still have hundreds of targets in Gaza, including rocket launchers ready to fire rockets on Israel,’ she said.

‘The only thing of concern is how to 
stop the rockets threatening three million people – just under half of 
the total Israeli population.’ Rockets fired from Gaza yesterday made 
direct hits on the Israeli towns of Ashkelon Ashdod and Ofakim without 
causing any casualties, the IDF reported.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said 
Hamas bears ‘principal responsibility’ for sparking the current conflict
 but added Israel risks losing international sympathy if it launches a 
ground invasion.

US President Barak Obama, beginning a 
tour of Asia, backed Israel’s right to defend itself and said any effort
 to resolve the conflict in Gaza ‘starts with no missiles being fired 
into Israel’s territory’.

Yesterday it emerged that Israel had sent a senior official to Egypt in an attempt to broker a ceasefire.

Israel said it was widening its 
campaign of air strikes by targeting the homes of militant leaders. More
 than a dozen Hamas-linked houses were hit yesterday.

But the deaths of members of the Daloo family threaten to change international opinion on the Israeli offensive.

The IDF says it has fine-tuned its weapons and tactics to avoid civilian casualties.

It also blames Palestinian militants for endangering civilians by storing and firing rockets from residential areas.

Palestinian militants continued their attacks, firing dozens of missiles into Israel reaching as far as the main city Tel Aviv.

Two rockets fired at Tel Aviv from 
Gaza were shot down by Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile defence shield, a
 police spokesman said.

The Foreign Press Association has expressed its concern after buildings housing news organisations in Gaza were hit during Israeli air strikes last night, injuring eight journalists.

The Israel Defence force said the sites that were targeted overnight 'were all positively identified by precise intelligence over the course of months', but the FPA has dismissed these claims.

The FPA said, 'One building [that was attacked] houses or has been used by the following FPA members: British news organisations Sky News, and Sky News Arabia, MBC TV, Al Arabiya, ORF and other European broadcasters'.

The other building hit houses ARD TV, it added.

Israel’s Channel Two TV station also reported two explosions and two interceptions by the missile protection system.

Meanwhile, a senior Israeli diplomat 
was spotted arriving in Cairo for secret talks aimed at ending the 
increasingly bloody conflict.

But government spokesman Mark Regev 
said Israel ‘is not interested in a temporary solution that will last 
only two weeks or a month’. He added: ‘If all that Hamas is willing to 
agree on is a time-out, then that’s not good enough.’

The conflict erupted on Wednesday when
 Israel killed Ahmed Al-Jabari, the military commander of Hamas, in a 
missile strike on his car in Gaza City.

Israel claims it was responding to 
escalating rocket attacks on its citizens with 124 fired between 
November 10 and 13. Al-Jabari, who Israel blamed for the rocket attacks,
 was killed the next day.

Defence: An Israeli missile is launched from the Iron Dome defence missile system, designed to intercept and destroy incoming short-range rockets and artillery shells

In five days of fighting against Gaza-based militants, Israel has used a missile-defense system called 'Iron Dome' to intercept rockets fired at populated civilian areas.It says the new home-grown system has been a tremendous success. As of Saturday evening, the military said it had shot down some 240 incoming rockets, more than half the number of projectiles launched into Israel since Wednesday.Here's a quick look at the system:
