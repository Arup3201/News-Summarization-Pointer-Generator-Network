Arsenal are the latest club to have joined the race to sign Marco Reus, according to reports in Germany.

German newspaper Welt says the Gunners are leading the chase for the Borussia Dortmund star's signature.

The 25-year-old forward looks set to leave Jurgen Klopp's side in the near future after rejecting a contract extension in July.

On the move? German newspaper Welt reports that Arsenal lead the race to sign Marco Reus

Top talent: Reus (left) scored 21 goals in 39 matches for Borussia Dortmund last season

Reus has a release clause of £19.8million that comes into effect next summer and Welt reports that Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is a huge admirer of his talents and is keen to bring him to the Emirates Stadium.

The paper adds that despite interest from Liverpool and Bayern Munich, the FA Cup winners are in pole position to sign Reus, with the cost of transfer fee and wages not a problem for the North London club.

Welt's news will come as a blow to Premier League title rivals Liverpool and Manchester United who have been linked with the German international after details of his release clause were leaked.

The highly-rated Germany forward has Europe's top clubs circling after two successful years at Dortmund in the Bundesliga.

Reus rejoined Dortmund in 2012 from Borussia Monchengladbach after his hometown club released him as a 17-year-old.

He scored 21 goals in 39 matches for Dortmund last season and offers creativity but missed Germany's triumphant World Cup campaign through injury.
