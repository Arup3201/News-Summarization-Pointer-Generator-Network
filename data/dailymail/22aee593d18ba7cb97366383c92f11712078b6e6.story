A British holidaymaker who was seriously injured when a teenage boy crashed into her while they received ski lessons in the French Alps is taking legal action against the tour operator who organised the trip.

Juliet Doyle, from Northfield in Birmingham, said she struggles to complete simple tasks and was forced to temporarily end her pursuit of a radiotherapy and oncology degree as a result of her injuries.

The 50-year-old mother of three is seeking compensation to help with her recovery and rehabilitation after suffering torn ligaments in her left knee, a fractured right ankle and a torn rotator cuff in her right shoulder  at Saint-Gervais, France in April 2013.

Juliet booked the family ski holiday and lessons with Peak Retreats Limited to celebrate her son’s 21st birthday.

She was waiting for the rest of her group to ski to the bottom of the slope when a 14-year-old boy in the class crashed into her from behind.

She claims the boy had been repeatedly warned about his behaviour and told that he was skiing too fast and beyond his capabilities.

Juliet said she has had an operation on her ankle after a cyst developed on the bone and will undergo a bone graft this month.

She also needs an operation to repair her damaged shoulder and requires ongoing physiotherapy to aid her recovery.

She said: ‘This skiing holiday to France with my family was supposed to be a relaxing break to celebrate my son’s 21st birthday and an opportunity to improve my skiing. Instead, I have been left with injuries that have had a huge impact on me, both physically and in my career.

‘At the time of the accident I was training to be a radiographer and was working hard to reach my goals and start a new career. However, all my hard work may be wasted as I no longer have a place at the university and will have to reapply once I recover and am able to attend lectures.

‘The injuries have also affected my day-to-day life as I can no longer do simple tasks around the house or walk my dog. I’ve also missed a number of family occasions and I’ve been left feeling frustrated, angry and upset by the circumstances of my accident and the physical damage it has caused.

‘I’m taking legal action to help get the support for further rehabilitation for my injuries so that I can get my life back on track. But I also hope that my case acts as a reminder of the dangers that skiers face and that all ski holiday operators will make sure they keep their novice skiers safe during their lessons.’

A spokesperson for Peak Retreats Limited told MailOnline Travel: 'Peak Retreats was recently saddened to hear that Mrs Doyle had an accident during her holiday in 2013.

'It was first notified of the alleged incident over a year and a half after it was said to have occurred and is still investigating the matter with the local ski school and its insurers.

'It is therefore unable to add any other comments at this stage. Sadly accidents between skiers can occur anywhere on the slopes and for this reason Peak Retreats always insist its clients have adequate ski travel insurance in place.'

Juliet has hired solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to seek compensation from Peak Retreats Limited.

Joseph Dawson, a specialist travel lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘What was supposed to be an enjoyable week-long break for Juliet has resulted in almost two years of pain and suffering and turned her life upside down.

‘We are now taking legal action, on Juliet’s behalf, to secure compensation, to include the necessary funds to cover her physiotherapy and rehabilitation costs so that we can maximise her chances of a good recovery. ‘
