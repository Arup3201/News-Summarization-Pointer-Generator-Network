A diplomat has been freed more than 18 months after he was snatched by terrorists on his way to work at the Iranian embassy in Yemen.

Nour-Ahmad Nikbakht's return was broadcast today on Iran's state media as he thanked the country's secret services and foreign ministry for getting him home.

Mr Nikbakht was working at Iran's embassy in the Yemeni capital Sanaa in July 2013 when he was kidnapped by suspected Al Qaeda gunmen.

Increasing danger: Iranian diplomat Nour-Ahmad Nikbakht was working at Iran's embassy in the Yemeni capital Sanaa (pictured) in July 2013 when he was kidnapped by terrorists and held for more than 18 months

The militants held him in a remote area between the southern provinces of Shabwa and Baida, tribal and Yemeni security sources said. 

As he returned today to Tehran's Mehrabad Airport, he told state media: 'I was kidnapped by unknown gunmen and terrorists as I left my home to go to work.'

He added that 'many efforts were made by soldiers from (Iran's secret services), the intelligence ministry and the foreign ministry' to secure his release.

The state news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Hossein AmirAbdollahian as saying: 'A special team from the Intelligence Ministry was able to
free Nikbakht from the clutches of terrorists in a series of
complex and difficult operations in a very particular part of
Yemen'.

Mr Nikbakht was the second high-profile hostage to be freed in
Yemen this week after a Saudi diplomat kidnapped in 2012 and held by Al Qaeda was
released on Monday.

With oil giant Saudi Arabia on its northern border and Al-Shabaab base Somalia a short way across the sea, Yemen is in a crucial position in the fight against terror.

But the United Nations has warned Yemen is 'on the brink of civil war' after Iranian-backed Shia Muslim militants known as Houthis seized the capital in September.

The move prompted a violent backlash by Sunni Muslim militants - including Al Qaeda, many of whose terrorist operations are run from Yemen.

'On the brink of civil war': Yemeni gunmen loyal to the Houthi movement which has swept to power in Sanaa

Last month Al Qaeda-linked fighters seized an army base in  the southern province of Shabwa which had held up to 2,000 government soldiers.

The Ansar al-Sharia group said on Twitter that it had set off a suicide bomb at the gate, took control of three guard towers and a tank and imprisoned some of the troops.

The Houthis, meanwhile are continuing their spread across the country too prompting violent clashes with Sunni tribesmen. 

Jamal Benomar, the UN Special Envoy to Yemen, said last month: 'We believe the situation is very dangerous. Yemen is on the brink of civil war'.

He accused all sides of contributing to the political and economic turmoil and called for more talks. 

Yemen has been gripped by unrest since president Ali Abdullah Saleh stepped down in early 2012 after a bloody year-long popular uprising.

In January last year, another Iranian diplomat, Ali Asghar Assadi, was shot dead in an attack in a neighbourhood in Sanaa housing several foreign embassies.
