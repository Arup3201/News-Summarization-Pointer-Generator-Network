'We also had a first for Mardi Gras! Three of Australia's highest ranking officials walked the Parade route with the Australian Defence Forces float. Their involvement has helped spread the message of acceptance, equality and support throughout the armed forces and the entire Australian community.

'I feel I speak for the LGBTQI community when I say we appreciate their continued support and friendship.'
