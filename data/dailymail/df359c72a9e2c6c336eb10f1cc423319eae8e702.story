Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel silenced a roomful of attendees at a speech on Wednesday when he joked that an Indian member of his audience might be a member of the Taliban.

The embarrassing incident occurred during a question and answer session following Hagel’s policy speech at the University of Nebraska in Omaha.

‘You’re not a member of the Taliban, are you?’ Hagel asked as he waited for the next question from the audience.

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel silenced a roomful of attendees at a speech on Wednesday when he joked that an Indian member of his audience might be a member of the Taliban

After a cringe-worthy silence, the man, who was Indian, identified himself as Robin Gandhi, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska Omaha.

Hagel had answered a question about the Taliban in Afghanistan just before calling on the man.

‘Following a question related to the Taliban, the Secretary made an off-the-cuff joke before the next questioner was called or selected at an appearance at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Absolutely no slight toward any individual in the audience was intended.

'That’s the last thing the Secretary would do under any circumstance, in this or any other setting. He didn’t know who would be called next to pose a question,’ said Pentagon spokesman George Little.

Gandhi, right, has said he was honored to have attended Hagel's event and said he didn't believe the Taliban remark was aimed at him

Gandhi also released a statement saying he was honored to have attended Hagel’s event, reports NBC News.

'I
was honored to attend Secretary of Defense Hagel’s speech on Wednesday.
I was able to ask a question, and I thoroughly enjoyed hearing his 
answer. Before I rose to ask a question, there was apparently some 
confusion that did not involve me,' the statement read.

Hagel had spoken about the new 
nuclear arms posture delivered by President Obama in Berlin on Wednesday
and about how Strategic Command will help implement the changes.
