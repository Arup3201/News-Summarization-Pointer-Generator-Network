A body pulled from Lake Washington has been identified as that of a man who vanished while out on his boat more than two years ago.

Richard Sweezey, 67, was last seen leaving Seattle's Queen City Yacht Club in his yacht on July 20, 2012

Police began an investigation after his boat was found grounded later that day.

When King County Marine Unit Deputies searched the boat, a 48-foot 1965 Chris Craft Roamer, they found it unoccupied. 

'When deputies got there they found that nobody was in the boat but there was a generator inside there that was running, and a tool that was hooked to it via an extension cord was hanging over the side of the boat and into the water,' King County Sheriff's Sergeant Cindi West told KOMO at the time. 

The King County Sheriff’s Office Guardian 1 Helicopter, the U.S. Coast Guard and Seattle Police Marine Patrol all participated in a search for Sweezey's body but without finding anything.

After the investigation was called off, Sweezey’s friends and family raises tens of thousands of dollars for their own search of the lake, using sonar technology. 

But that too proved unsuccessful.

The King County Medical Examiner’s Office later classified Sweezey’s death as an accident.

Sweezey left behind a wife, Rae Ann Engdahl, and two step-children, Jeremy and Kinley.
