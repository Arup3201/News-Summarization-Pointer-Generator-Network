It is two decades since his infamous kung fu attack on a fan, but it seems that Eric Cantona has lost none of his fiery temperament.

His latest brush with trouble occurred when the footballer turned actor was drinking outside a London pub with a mystery brunette.

The former Manchester United star appeared deep in conversation with his companion as they drank beer in the sunshine.

But
 seconds after being spotted by a paparazzo, Cantona lashed out. Police 
were called to The Queens pub in Primrose Hill after the photographer 
was punched in the face.

The 47-year-old Frenchman, a married father of two, was arrested and bundled into a police car.

He was taken to a North London police station and held for more than six hours before accepting a caution.

Witnesses
 said his companion went inside the pub and waited before leaving 
through another door.

Cantona was famously arrested and convicted of 
assault in January 1995 for kung-fu kicking a Crystal Palace fan.

The incident happened during a match at Selhurst Park, when the fan hurled abuse at him after he was sent off.

Cantona
 was sentenced to two weeks in jail.

When that was reduced on appeal to 
120 hours’ community service, he reacted with a bizarre remark, telling a
 Press conference: ‘When the seagulls follow the trawler, it’s because 
they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.’

Cantona jumps into the crowd for his infamous kung-fu kick in 1995

Cantona has made a living as a model and actor since retiring from professional football in 1997

He was also banned from football for eight months.

Yesterday Cantona’s sports agent brother Jean-Marie refused to comment on Wednesday’s incident.

Cantona,
 who lives in Paris with actress Rachida Brakni, his second wife, has 
forged a career in film since quitting football in 1997.

Passers-by
 say the Frenchman initially refused to stop and talk to a policeman, 
who had to step in front of him to bring him to a halt.

Photographer
 Amari-Jade Robinson was driving past the scene near Regent's Park and 
at first thought the uniformed policeman was a football supporter.

He said: 'I thought he might be a fan and wanted to just speak to him.

'My
 window was wound down and I said out loud "I think that's Eric Cantona"
 and he looked round to me when I said it so I knew it was him.

'I
 was stopped in traffic for around three minutes and at first I didn't 
think he was getting in trouble, but then he seemed to be a bit 
frustrated.

'He attempted to walk away and looked a bit frustrated but the officer went in front of him. He was side stepping to block him.

'He
 seemed a bit frustrated at first, moving his arms, but then he seemed 
to calm down and talk to the officer - it looked like he was trying to 
explain something.'

Mr Amari-Jade then drove on and said he did not see what happened with Cantona after that.

Other witnesses said they saw police cars outside the Queens pub in Regents Park Road, where Cantona is thought to have had lunch.

A builder, who did not want to be named, said: 'I went to move my van at about 12ish and saw Eric outside the pub.

Cantona captained United in their successful 1996-97 season and scored the winning goal in the 1996 FA Cup final against Liverpool

'He was with two people and had a pint in front of him but didn't seem drunk at all.'

A
 local shop owner said she saw two cops parked up outside the pub around
 midday - but didn't see the footballer getting arrested.

Workers at the pub refused to comment on the incident yesterday.

Cantona has become well known for his philosophical one-liners. Here is a selection of some of his best:-

On
 his achievements: 'I am searching for abstract ways of expressing 
reality, abstract forms that will enlighten my own mystery.'

On life: 'He who has regrets cannot look at himself in the mirror.'

On his looks: 'If someone is too perfect they won't look good. Imperfection is important.'

On education: 'I didn't study; I live.'

On
 his career: 'My best moment? I have a lot of good moments but the one I
 prefer is when I kicked the hooligan (at Crystal Palace).'

The
 Metropolitan Police said in a statement: 'Police were called to Regents
 Park Road, at 12.55pm on Wednesday 12th March, following reports of an 
assault.

'Officers from Camden Borough attended and a man in his 40s was arrested on suspicion of common assault.

'He was taken into custody and subsequently cautioned for common assault.

'The victim, a man, did not require medical assistance at the scene.'

Cantona was previously married to Isabelle Ferrer with whom he has two children.

Seven
 years ago, after he divorced his teacher wife, he married actress 
Rachida Brakni, later claiming that he had fallen in love at first 
sight.

Cantona
 was dogged by controversy during his playing days and was famously 
given 120 hours of community service for attacking Crystal Palace fan 
Matthew Simmons at Selhurst Park in January 1995.

The
 striker narrowly avoided prison after taking his case to the Court of 
Appeal, where judges reduced his two-week jail term reduced to the 
community sentence.

Cantona, who was worshipped by Manchester United fans as 'King Eric' and 'Le God', became as famous for his bizarre outbursts off the pitch as his performances on it.

He has stayed in the public eye since retiring from football and starred as himself in the 2009 film Looking For Eric, directed by Ken Loach.

He recently returned to screens in a tongue-in-cheek TV advert for French beer Kronenbourg 1664, which claimed hop farmers in the Alsace region of France are treated as well as footballers.

But the ad was engulfed in a row when the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the campaign for misleading drinkers about the true origins of the beer.

The watchdog found the adverts misled viewers into thinking that the entire brewing process took place in France.
