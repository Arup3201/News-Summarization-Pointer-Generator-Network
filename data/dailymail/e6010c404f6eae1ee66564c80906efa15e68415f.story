MPs have signed off on plans to spend more than £200,000 doing up Parliament's most exclusive restaurant.

The plush Strangers’ Dining Room will be almost entirely refurbished, House of Commons authorities have confirmed.

A ten-week touch up will take place during the MPs’ summer holiday this year - with the carpets, curtains and fireplaces set to be given an overhaul.

The public subsidy for MPs' food and drink runs into the millions every year, House of Commons figures reveal

A Commons spokesman claimed the refurbishment would pay for itself - because it is can be hired out when MPs are away from Parliament on recess.

But critics are likely to point out that the dining room is already subsidised by taxpayers - alongside all the other restaurants, bars and coffee shops in Parliament.

MPs have access to the outside terrace of Strangers' Bar in Parliament - a sister pub to the the Strangers' Dining Room which is getting a £200,000 facelift

Last year it was revealed that the bars, restaurants and cafes in the House of Commons cost taxpayers £4.9million in 2012/13 - a subsidy of £7,500 per MP.

The eight venues selling food and drink in the Lords needed a further £2.3million of public cash, according to freedom of information. This meant the total subsidy for both houses was £7.2million.

A House of Commons spokesman today insisted the the 'Strangers’ Dining Room', as it is known, was 'a part of the Grade I listed Palace of Westminster' and was in desperate need of a touch up.

'Its deteriorating condition means conservation work is now necessary to restore many of the room’s historic features to a comparable standard of other Grade 1 buildings and World Heritage Sites and to secure future income generation,' the spokesman added.

A source added that the room was an 'architecturally and historically important fine room' in Parliament.

The room is used as a function room for hire when MPs are away on holiday, Commons officials argued - meaning that it needed redecorating to attract more diners.

The Conservation of Strangers’ Dining Room project is scheduled to be carried out during the summer recess later this year.

Decorators will touch up the ceiling, reinstate a 'historic decorative scheme, involving painted stencil decoration and wood graining, using traditional paint' and 'revive polish and repair oak panelling'.

The carpet and curtains will also be replaced, alongside the 'restoration of the fireplace including new stone fender, new brass fireguard, encaustic tile fireback and glazed tile hearth, all to a bespoke design'.
