The daughter of a man killed when an NYPD officer  restrained him with an outlawed chokehold  is staging a 'die in' on the spot where her father was slain in a bid to cast a spotlight on police brutality.

Erica Garner's father, Eric, a 43-year-old black man, died when officer Daniel Pantaleo attempted to subdue him  in Tompkinsville, Staten Island, on July 17, after arresting him for selling bootleg cigarettes on the street.

She has performed the protest - in which she lies across the sidewalk using a megaphone to incite passers by to join her - twice a week since her father's death.

'Die in': She said she has performed the protest every Tuesday and Thursday for almost five months in bid to cast a spotlight on police brutality

Support: Her protests inspired dozens of New Yorkers to join her by lying down on the spot where he died

'I feel the love and energy from around the world, but on Staten Island it's been emotionless,' the 24-year-old told the Daily News after Thursday's demonstration in front of a beauty supply store where officers confrontedMr Garner.

'I felt his spirit when I was walking down to the spot,' she added. 'I've been doing this every Tuesday and Thursday since my father's death. I do it without cameras there. I do it with cameras there, and I'm going to keep doing it.'

On December 3, a grand jury in Staten Island sparked global outrage after it refused to indict white police officer Pantaleo over the chokehold that killed the father-of-six.

The confrontation began when Pantaleo arrested him for illegally selling cigarettes on the street.

'I can't breathe': His last words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in New York and other cities after Pantaleo was not indicted

In the ensuing tussle, the officer put Garner in the controversial headlock moments before Garner was heard saying: 'I can't breathe.'

They turned out to be the last words he ever spoke. He passed out and later died in hospital.

His last words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in New York and other cities after Pantaleo escaped indictment. 

It comes a day after it was revealed the NYPD has begun its own investigation over whether Pantaleo broke departmental rules when he arrested Garner for illegally selling cigarettes on the street, according to DNA Info.

In amateur video taken of the arrest, Pantaleo appeared to put Garner in a chokehold before forcing him to the ground holding him down while he was being cuffed. 

Chokeholds - the controversial technique of subduing suspects by restricting their breathing - are banned by the NYPD, though Pantaleo denies using one on Garner, despite video evidence that has been widely interpreted otherwise.

The medical examiner found that Garner, who was 6-foot-3 and 350lbs, died of a heart attack resulting from compression of neck and of chest and 'prone positioning during physical restraint by police'.

However, his asthma, obesity and other health problems were also blamed for his death. 

Investigators with the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau questioned Pantaleo for two hours on Monday, according to DNA Info.

'He pretty much told the same story he did to the grand jury, his actions, his thoughts, during the Garner encounter,' a police source told the news site.

The 29-year-old cop has been pulled off the streets and stripped of his badge and gun pending the outcome of the investigation. He still works at the NYPD on desk duty.

He has apologised to Garner's family, saying he felt 'very bad' about his death and sent his condolences.

However, Garner's widow, Esaw, rejected the apology, telling a press conference on December 3: 'Hell no! The time for remorse would have been when my husband was yelling to breathe. 

'No, I don't accept his apology. No, I could care less about his condolences.

'He's still working. He's still getting a paycheck. He's still feeding his kids, when my husband is six feet under and I'm looking for a way to feed my kids now.'

The investigation will likely take weeks, or even months, to conclude.
