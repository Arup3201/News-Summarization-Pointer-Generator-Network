A good World Cup performance can send the
 scouts circling like vultures, and Ahmed Musa's double in Nigeria's 3-2 loss to Argentina can only do the same.

The CSKA Moscow forward scored Nigeria's fastest-ever goal at a World Cup on four minutes, and became their first player to score twice in one game in the tournament.

Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look at the largely unknown 21-year-old.

Who is Ahmed Musa? The winger's double against Argentina made him the first Nigerian in World Cup to do so

On the up: Musa, just 21, is a rising star and showed he can handle the pressure in the World Cup

2008-2010: Aminchi FA (0 apps, 0 gls)

2008-2009: JUTH (loan) (18, 4)

2009-2010: Kano Pillars (loan) (25, 18)

2010-2012: VVV-Venlo (37, 8)

2012-NOW: CSKA Moscow (65, 19)

2010-NOW: Nigeria (37, 6)

What's his history?

Musa remained off
 the beaten track until Russian Premier League club CSKA Moscow swooped, but the forward put in his time to get there.

An Aminchi Football Academy product, Musa's second professional year on loan at Kano Pillars, scoring 18 goals in 25 games, saw him come to life. In doing so, he set a record in the Nigeria Premier League.

It pricked the ears of Eredivisie outfit VVV-Venlo, who signed Musa in 2010. He waited until he was 18 under FIFA rules, as did VVV, and it paid off.

We could have been introduced to Musa in the 2010 World Cup, after Lars Lagerback called him up to the 30-man squad for South Africa, but an unfortunate ankle injury prevailed.

An unnamed Bundesliga team bid £8million in 2011, which was turned down, before Moscow got their man for an undisclosed fee in 2012.

Goal: Musa shoots to score his second goal against Argentina, bringing his tally to six for his country

Curler: Musa's first stole the show of the game, though, as he curled home a beauty from the left wing

CSKA MOSCOW: Russian Premier League (2012-13, 2013-14), Russian Cup (2012-13), Russian Super Cup (2013)

NIGERIA: Africa Cup of Nations (2013), WAFU Nations Cup (2010)

What's his goalscoring record like?

Statistics don't lie, and neither do Musa's. Since moving to Moscow, the forward has performed admirably on the wing, scoring 19 in 65 in the Russian Premier League.

He has bags of potential, particularly at such a young age, and showed he can bring that to the world stage against Argentina. His brace in the Group F finale brought his total for Nigeria to six in 37 games, and Musa could have had his hat-trick had it not been for heroic defending from Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta, who was given a run for his money by his pacey counterpart.

Has he adapted well to new countries?

From Nigeria, to Holland, then Russia - and even Brazil - Musa has taken to each well.

It would be unfair to compare the Eredivisie and Russian Premier League to that in England, but there seem to be no causes for concern should Musa attract interest from the likes of Tottenham Hotspur, as he did in 2011, or others.

Musa has spent two years in Russia, winning the title twice, and seems comfortable.

Has
 he attracted interested?

For a largely unknown player, Musa has been on many a shortlist.

Most notably in England is that of Tottenham Hotspur who, during his VVV days, were reported to have sent scouts to Holland. There have also been Eredivisie giants Ajax on the hunt and the anonymous Bundesliga club whose £8m could not tempt him to Germany.

Is it time he tested his mettle in the English Premier League?

It is known to be the most demanding - and rewarding - league in the world, so no wonder most players aim for England.

Musa would surely fit in, given the two impressive goals he bagged against Argentina to become the first Nigerian to ever bag a brace in a World Cup match. There, he more than held his own against an array of stars, including Marcos Rojo, Ezeuiel Garay and Javier Mascherano to name a few.

He would, though, have to up his 
physical game. Musa, for all his technical ability when it comes to 
scoring, hardly looks strong enough in his five foot seven frame to 
battle in the Premier League. That, though, is something that can easily
 be worked on.

Celebrate: Musa could be Premier League bound after showing his talent in the World Cup for Nigeria

Who could be interested?

As we know, Tottenham already showed an interest but didn't make their move in 2011. Unfortunately for those at White Hart Lane, putting in such an impressive World Cup performance can only see Musa's stock go up.

Everton may not be too disinterested in giving the forward his chance in the Premier League, particularly given they lost Gerard Deulofeu to Barcelona after his loan spell last season. There is also Sunderland, who may have something to say about Musa's future.

On his way? The likes of Tottenham, Everton and Sunderland may be intrigued by the pacey player
