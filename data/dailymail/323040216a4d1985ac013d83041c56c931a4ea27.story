A killer who threatened to show his 'dark side' during his trial for two brutal murders has been jailed for at least 37 years.

James Allen beat 81-year-old Colin Dunford to death in his Middlesbrough home and murdered Julie Davison, 50, in a horrific stabbing attack at her flat in Whitby.

The 36-year-old killer, who had just 96p in his bank account, deliberately targeted the victims, who both lived alone, so that he could take their money.

James Allen, who killed twice, was jailed for at least 37 years today after he was convicted of two counts of murder

Allen was on the run for a week after the first killing while both Cleveland and North Yorkshire Police drafted in more than 100 officers to hunt for the violent fugitive.

He was eventually arrested in Leeds by an off duty police officer who spotted him on his way to work.

During a four week trial at Newcastle Crown Court Allen, of Middlesbrough, denied he was responsible for either killing but bizarrely told jurors he would confess to one of the murders if prosecutors could produce any solid evidence against him.

While giving evidence from the witness box Allen branded prosecutor Robert Smith 'boring' and said the case against him was a 'joke.'

He used foul and abusive language to both the judge and prosecutor and even threatened to show his 'dark side' when asked questions about his late mother.

Julie Davison and Colin Dunford, were attacked by Allen, who showed 'no remorse' for his crimes

After less than four hours deliberation jurors found him guilty of both murders.

Mr Justice Openshaw gave Allen two life sentences and said he must serve at least 37 years before he can even apply for parole.

The judge told him: 'These were murders of exceptional brutality and savagery.

'You have shown not the slightest remorse.'

Prosecutor Robert Smith QC told the court Mr Dunford was killed on April 22 and Miss Davison met her violent death three days later.

Mr Dunford’s battered body was found by Angeline Dicicco who had gone to the pensioner’s home with a group of friends who had become worried when he did not turn up for his nightly pint at the local social club.

Ms Davison’s body was found by her sister Dawn Kibble who had become worried when she could not get in touch with her.

Mr Smith told jurors: 'The two of them had no connection with each other and there is nothing to suggest they knew each other or had contact with any person who knew them both.

'It is the prosecution’s case that they were each murdered by the same man, despite the distance between their homes and the differences in their personal circumstances.

'The motive for their deaths in each instance was robbery.

'Each of them was brutally attacked within their homes, the contents of which had been ransacked and the person responsible, having regard to the degree of violence used, could have intended nothing less than their deaths.

'After each of them had been murdered the person responsible left the home of each of them, locking the door behind them using the victim’s key.'

The court heard Mr Dunford, a frequent visitor to his local supermarket and social club, was described by those who knew him as somebody you could 'set your watch by' and lived a routine, safety conscious life.

It is thought he was killed in the hours after he got home from visiting a friend’s home on April 22 and his body was found by his worried friends the following day.

Mr Smith said: 'Colin Dunford died as a result of blunt injuries to his head and face caused by multiple, forceful impacts to his face and head, resulting in multiple abrasions, extensive bruising, lacerations and extensive fracturing of the bones of the face.

'A substantial number of the blows he sustained to the head must have been in the form of kicks and stamps, while some may have been due to punches.'

Miss Davison was 'physically vulnerable' and had been disabled by a painful degenerative disease which she took pain relief medication for.

The 50-year-old, who also suffered from epilepsy, was last seen by a friend who left her home in the early morning of April 25 and was found dead in the flat by her sister and brother-in-law three hours later.

She had also been beaten and kicked.

Both of the victim’s homes had been ransacked and searched by the killer.

Mr Smith added: 'Their bodies were to be discovered by friends and family members who had become concerned about their failure to contact them.'

Mr Smith told jurors Allen can be linked to the killings through CCTV, telephone usage and witness evidence.

He added: 'In each instance he took from the homes of the two people he killed what money he could find and such of their personal possessions as he was interested in.'

On the morning after killing Mr Dunford in Middlesbrough Allen attempted to use the dead man’s bank card at an ATM machine then travelled by bicycle to Whitby.

He then went onto Scarborough and back to Whitby where he killed Miss Davison on April 25.

He sold clothing and jewellery belonging to Mrs Davison in Scarborough and sold her laptop in Leeds.

He was arrested in Leeds.
