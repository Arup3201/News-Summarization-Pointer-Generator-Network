Lee Craig Richardson, 41, (pictured) left his neighbour with a punctured lung after stabbing him just below the heart in a row over wheelie bins

A drunk man who stabbed his neighbour in the chest in a row over wheelie bins has been jailed for five years.

Lee Craig Richardson flew into a rage after being confronted when he kicked his neighbour's bins in anger outside his home in Whinney Banks, Middlesbrough.

The 41-year-old stabbed the victim, who has not been named, just below the heart causing him to suffer a punctured lung.

Richardson told police there had been a long-running feud between him and his neighbours over 'quite petty' issues and said he had initially kicked the bins because he was annoyed.

The victim was left needing a blood transfusion and could have died in the attack, Teesside Crown Court was told. He was forced to spend six days in hospital to recover.

Richardson admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, assault by beating and possession of a bladed article on Friday and was jailed for five years.

Prosecutor Emma Atkinson told the court that there had been previous disputes between Richardson and his neighbours leading up to the attack on November 11 last year.

She said: 'There's been a great deal of animosity between the two parties, more recently in relation to wheelie bins.'

She told the court how Richardson was drunk when he came out of his home in the early hours and kicked his neighbours' bins.

He was confronted by the woman who lived next door to him and responded by kicking her in the shin, the court heard.

Her partner then followed her outside to calm the commotion and was knifed in the lower chest by Richardson.

The neighbour did not realise what had happened to him at first and did not see a knife. He punched Richardson to the floor before he went inside, the court heard.

Ms Atkinson told the court: 'As he got into his kitchen he became acutely aware of the fact that he had in fact been stabbed.'

Police were called and officers found Richardson in his living room with a cut to his temple. He was persuaded to let go of an eight-inch knife which he was holding, and another five-inch blade was found in his pocket.

He told officers there had been 'quite petty' issues between the neighbours but said he could not remember exactly what happened.

Robert Mochrie, defending, said: 'There is no escaping the fact that this could have ended up being a murder charge. It's perhaps the good fortune of both the complainant and the defendant that the heart wasn't touched by the blade.'

Mr Mochrie said there was a high degree of 'slow-burn provocation' where Richardson was 'pushed and pushed and pushed'.

He claimed Richardson's life was made 'a living misery for many, many months' with anti-social behaviour, verbal threats and one allegation of physical assault.

He told the court it built up upset and frustration in a man of good standing who had worked to make something of himself.

He said Richardson petulantly kicked the bins and that matters had simply spiralled out of control.

Mr Mochrie also told the court how Richardson took the kitchen knife 'in case there was any confrontation', not to seek out the victim and stab him, and acted on the spur of the moment without thinking.

'It's a real tragedy that he has landed himself if this position but he knows there's no escaping that,' Mr Mochrie said.

The judge, Recorder Jamie Hill QC, heard how it was the first offences committed by Richardson in 13 years before jailing him.

He said: 'This is a classic and appalling example of what can happen when neighbour disputes get out of hand. It's a mercy that [the victim] wasn't killed and that you're not facing a murder charge quite frankly.'

He said there was no provocation for the assault itself as Richardson started the chain of events that night with his 'childish action'.

'I accept that you are genuinely remorseful for everything that's happened,' the judge added.
