David Moyes has reminded Wilfried Zaha that he is a Manchester United player after telling him he cant yet go on loan.

The United manager met the young winger on the training field yesterday and told him that he would not consider him for a move away from the club until fellow attackers Nani and Ashley Young were fit.

Moyes denied reports of a row between him and the youngster but has stressed in no uncertain terms that Zaha's obligations are to United.

Moyes said ahead of tomorrows game at Chelsea: 'Wilfried Zaha has a chance.

'I have told him that if I can’t get him the games I will put him out on loan.

'But he can’t go out while we have Ashley and Nani injured and I would be surprised if anyone thought was a possibility.' Cardiff City have been strongly linked with a loan move for Zaha, who has hardly played under Moyes this season.

Asked if he had argued with Zaha on 
Friday, Moyes said: 'I had 30 seconds chat on the training pitch today 
and we were talking away. So there was nothing like that.

'I have indicated to the boy (that he can go on loan when others get fit).

'But he is a Manchester United player, that’s what he is.'

Since Alex Ferguson paid £15million to bring Zaha from Crystal Palace last January, the England winger has only played a meagre 167minutes on the pitch.

Speaking in October, Moyes said: ''Wilf has not appeared. We have not felt we have had the opportunity. I want Wilf to get used to what happens here.

'The competition is hard. It is important Wilf gets to see the level of the training here, the level of the players and the quality they have got. He is getting better.’

Despite his underwhelming start, Gareth Southgate insists it is too early to write off Zaha's career at Old Trafford.

‘I am sure in time he 
will be an asset for Manchester United but I guess everything there with
 the new manager and everything, everybody is getting used to a new way 
of working,' said the England Under 21 manager.

Not the right time: Zaha will be allowed to leave on loan if United's injury problems ease

Moyes has confirmed that several teams are interested in taking Zaha on loan - with former club Crystal Palace the most prominent, although manager Tony Pulis has revealed that Moyes does not want the player to return to London.

'We’ve spoken to David Moyes about Zaha and I don’t think he’s too keen on him coming back to London,' he told talkSPORT in January.

'It’s
 not a problem for us, he’s a Manchester United player. We don’t think 
it’s a goer, although we were very keen if there was a possibility to 
take him on.'

Wilfried Zaha has played a mere 28 minutes in the Premier League for Manchester United in two cameo substitute appearances - and he had to wait for December for his first top-flight match.

Dec 7: Man Utd 0 Newcastle 1 (22 mins)

Dec 15: Aston Villa 0 Man Utd 3 (six mins)

He has not really made an impact in those games, having just 29 touches in 28 minutes. He has had one (off-target) shot, and has tried just 11 passes, completing 64 per cent of them. Most surprisingly for Zaha, given his style of play, he has attempted just four dribbles and only one of those has been a success. His one cross also came to nothing.
