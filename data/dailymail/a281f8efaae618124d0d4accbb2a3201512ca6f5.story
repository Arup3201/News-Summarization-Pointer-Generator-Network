I had a good feeling about my home grand prix at Monaco because obviously we have had a fast car this season. The big question was whether any of our rivals would get closer to us, and while that was the case, we were still absolutely dominant and that was fantastic for the team.   

The result of qualifying was hugely important because it is vital to start from pole around the tight streets of Monte Carlo.

Of course, there was an issue where I left the track in my final run which brought out the yellow flags. I made a mistake, went off the road, and then I found out they wanted to investigate the incident to see if I had done it on purpose. So, that was quite awkward, and I didn't see it coming.

However, I understood why the 
stewards would wanted to look into it because of the circumstances, and I 
was confident that the incident would be quickly dismissed. It was clear
 by looking at the data that every thing I'd done on the lap in question
 had been very similar to my previous laps. It was obvious that I had done
 nothing on purpose.  

The
 running order during qualifying is taken in turns between myself and 
Lewis at each weekend – one weekend I choose whether I run first or 
second on the road, the next weekend it's Lewis. In Monaco, it was 
actually my engineer who made the call because I didn't answer when he 
asked me. So he took the decision, determined what was best for us and 
so I went out first.  

Starting
 from pole was obviously the best place to be in Monaco, and we got a 
great getaway for once. We have worked a lot on our starts because it 
was a weakness, but we have made great progress on that which is hugely 
important for the remainder of the season.   

From
 then on in it was vital to control the tyres and the pace of the race. 
My team-mate was always directly behind me applying as much pressure as 
he could to try and force me into a mistake. So, it was not an easy 
grand prix with him right behind me the whole time.

I
 made sure I did not wear out the tyres because that was the one thing 
that could have caught me out, and by the end of the race I had really 
good pace and managed to pull away from Lewis to get a clear gap and win
 the grand prix which was a fantastic experience.   

To
 win in Monaco for the second time in as many seasons was unreal. So, we
 had a great party, at several locations, in the evening.

We
 started on the beach and then I went for dinner with Prince Albert 
which was a very special experience. Obviously, that sort of thing 
doesn't happen every day, and being a local resident in Monaco made it 
even more special. 

I
 made a speech in front of everybody and there were huge fireworks 
display which they announced in my honour; all of which was pretty 
crazy. We then carried on the party with all of my friends so that was 
awesome and we all had a great time.

I
 am quite neutral about my relationship with Lewis Hamilton. It is 
always going to be the case that you have some difficult times which 
will be followed by good times.

Our strength is that we always talk 
about what has happened and go through things as we did when we were 
both 14. It is always going to be like that, and indeed it continues to 
be like that. 

Lewis
 issued a tweet last week commenting on our friendship, and that we'd 
spoken. I don't want to go into that detail of what was said, but be 
sure that when there are difficult moments we discuss them and move on, 
so there is nothing out of the ordinary in any way.    

Old friends: Rosberg and Hamilton have played down the intensity of their rivalry for this year's championship

On the Tuesday after my win in Monaco
 we went to Germany's World Cup training base, and there was a very 
serious incident where two people got injured. For everybody involved it was an extremely shocking experience.

Since
 then, we have been trying to take care of the people who were injured 
together with Mercedes and the German national team as much as possible.
 I don't want to go into too much detail about what happened because I 
want to maintain my full focus on the race weekend in Canada.

This
 week is the Canadian Grand Prix, and Montreal is the highest fuel 
consumption track of the year and the most difficult to get to the end 
of the race within the 100kilogram limit. That is something that we must
 pay attention to. I have worked on it during the simulator and it is 
all under control. That will be one of the main challenges of the 
weekend. 

I arrived 
into Montreal on Wednesday and we had a couple of nice commitments 
straight away in the evening. The first was a charity appearance for the
 Sainte-Justine Hospital and Girafonds here in Montreal. The Foundation 
is collecting money to help finance Pediatric Thyroid Illness Research 
and make it sustainable. Today, one child in 2,700 suffers from 
congenital hypothyroidism. This is one too many.

Then later on, we had a massive team dinner on Wednesday night which 
was always good. The whole team booked out a steak restaurant for 
everybody which was awesome. It is always great to get some private time
 and share some time with them, so we could relax a little bit and talk 
with all the guys who work so hard at the race weekends.

We are in the middle of the most incredible roll right now and making history for Mercedes each weekend. 

But
 everybody in the team knows that being successful depends on getting 
every detail right. One of those details is the team spirit and we are 
enjoying our success but also working hard to keep our feet on the 
ground. We are six races into the season and there is still a very long 
way to go…
