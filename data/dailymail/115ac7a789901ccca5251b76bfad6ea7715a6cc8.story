French police have been accused of 'beating' British-bound migrants living rough in Calais.

A highly critical report by Human Rights Watch claims refugees are subjected to 'harassment and abuse' on the streets of the northern French port.

There are an estimated 2,500 illegal immigrants in Calais all hoping to sneak across the Channel to Britain.

The report by the global organisation said it interviewed eight people who suffered broken bones caused by the police, and another 21 who were sprayed with tear gas.

Flare-ups have occurred in recent months between the rising
number of migrants, who try to sneak into cargo trucks passing
into Britain, and security forces. Last September, hundreds of
migrants protested what they said was police violence.

In the wake of clashes, French and British authorities
announced heightened security measures, but a shelter pledged by
the French government for 1,500 migrants and asylum seekers to
open by January is not yet fully functional, HRW said.  

Human Rights Watch said: 'Asylum seekers and migrants living in the poverty in the port city of Calais are victims of harassment and abuse by French police.

'Nineteen people, including two children said that police had abused them at least once, including through beatings.

'Eight were left with broken limbs or other visible injuries, which according to them were caused by police in Calais and the surrounding area.

'Twenty-one, including two children, have said that the police sprayed them with tear gas.'

Most of the migrants are living without shelter, with no
access to toilets and showers and limited access to running
water. Many rely on meals provided by local volunteer
organizations.

Under French law, asylum seekers have the right to be housed
in a state-run facility as they await the processing of their
claim.

Human Rights Watch said it had called on the French government to launch an immediate investigation and also provide police with guidance over the use of force. 

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve accused the group of 'not verifying the allegations of police violence to which it refers'.

 He added: 'The seriousness of the charges against the public security forces contained in this document should have led the association to approach those in charge of the police with specific facts.'

Calais Prefect Denis Robin, who oversees the police force, said many of the injuries suffered by refugees were as a result of fights between rival migrant gangs.
