Barcelona are flying high on the pitch since the resumption of the winter break and it appears the Catalan club are doing so likewise off it.

Barca's devastating attacking trio Luis Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi star in an advert for the Nou Camp outfit's sponsor Qatar Airways.

The forward three are joined by La Masia products Gerard Pique and Andres Iniesta in the 62-second short film that highlights the Airways' expansion of being able to fly to over 140 destinations worldwide.

The 62-second advert begins with Iniesta enjoying a flight away from Barcelona 

Neymar is then filmed showcasing his samba skills with a bottle of sun lotion in a Barca-style Hawaiian shirt

The 22-year-old's skills leave Pique speechless while they enjoy the beach

Accompanied to the Beach Boys hit 'I get around', the video begins with Iniesta reading a magazine as a voice comes over the PA system stating: 'Qatar Airways are proud to welcome on board FC Barcelona and wish you a wonderful holiday.'

The next scene cuts to Neymar and Pique lounging on a beach in matching Hawaian shirts - akin to the traditional colours of Barcelona's home strip.

Neymar's samba flair has made him one of the trickiest players to contain on a football pitch and the Brazil international demonstrates his array of tricks and flicks as he skillfully juggles a bottle of sun lotion to the amusement of Pique.

The 22-year-old has been in scintillating form up front for Luis Enrique's side this season - scoring 15 goals in La Liga this season.

Neymar's form in front of goal contrasts massively with strike partner Suarez, but that doesn't stop the 28-year-old showing his deadly prowess in an unusual sharp-shooter shoutout in Dallas in the next destination.

The advert then cuts to Iniesta and Pique enjoying in the Parisian performance art of mime before Doha is the next stop with Messi.

Depicted as a black belt in karate the Argentina captain waltzes his way through the opposition's challenges, who are dressed as ninjas, with a ball glued to his foot - mimicking his amazing close-control ability on the pitch.

The film ends with the quintet returning from their holidays to Barcelona and is the second advert the club have done with Qatar Airways - although there is no return of Dani Alves in the sequel.

On Wednesday it was revealed that the Barcelona defender is already looking for his next club after the Catalan giants failed to offer him a new contract.

The Brazilian's current deal finishes at the end of this season, which means he is free to negotiate with clubs outside of Spain ahead of a free transfer this summer.

Alves' agent, Dinorah Santana, believes Barca's failure to offer a new contract means the 31-year-old's time at the Nou Camp is up.

'They haven't contacted us,' Santana told Spanish radio station Cadena SER.

'I interpret that silence to mean they don't want Dani Alves, so we will begin searching for a new club.'

'We won't wait for Barcelona, they have to take the plunge,' added Santana. 'Alves has spent seven years here and he has behaved like a professional at all times.

'Barcelona have not had a sporting director for a month and Alves is free to negotiate with any club. (Former director of football) Andoni Zubizarreta didn't tell us anything.'

Alves, who joined the club for £32million from Sevilla in 2008, has made 16 appearances in La Liga this season and another five in the Champions League but still appears surplus to requirements under boss Enrique.
