Sergio Aguero did not turn up to a charity event on Friday where he was scheduled to meet young fans alongside Manchester derby participants Angel Di Maria, Pablo Zabaleta and Marcos Rojo, his compatriots from Argentina.

Aguero said he could not make it because he needed to pick up family members from the airport - even though his agent pencilled in the event several weeks ago.

But Rojo, the Manchester United hard-man who will be marking Aguero at the Etihad, had another theory. ‘I thought he was going to be here, just like you did. Maybe he’s scared!’

Rojo was not being entirely serious. But the pair do have history and Aguero’s decision to swerve the Premier League Kicks community event does heighten anticipation for their duel on Sunday — the ultimate grudge match in a derby full of blood and thunder.

The pair were Argentina team-mates at the World Cup and it was well-known they exchanged angry words after Rojo invited his best friend, pop star El Polaco, into the dressing-room after a game.

El Polaco happens to be the former boyfriend of Aguero’s partner Karina ‘La Princesita’ Tejeda, who is also a singer, and Aguero was furious by what he regarded as his team-mate’s treachery.

Even putting aside their personal relationship, Rojo promises no quarter will be given professionally.

Aguero scored four goals in City’s last Premier League home game against Tottenham and he has taken over the mantle from Luis Suarez as the hottest striker in England. If Rojo stops Aguero, United will believe they can win.

‘He’s one of the top strikers in the world and you have to stick close to him, that’s for sure. Be very attentive and get into him with a degree of firmness,’ asserts 24-year-old Rojo.

‘It will be a hard game and you have to play in a hard way. I don’t mean go crunching in, but to go in tough, the way he does. You have to play with close marking and strong tackles.

‘Certainly in the penalty area he is a very quick mover and gets into position very quickly. He can be controlled but it is up to us to keep an eye on where he is at all times.

‘I’ve never played against him before. We might exchange the odd word during the game but generally with opponents you tend to forget [who they are]. He’s City. We’re United. And that’s it. You put all that behind you, you go out there for the team and winning is everything.’

James Milner may be given a central role in the Manchester derby after David Silva was ruled out

Rojo played as a left-back during the World Cup when Argentina reached the final. The fact he has been centre-back for United so far this season sums up the chronic injury crisis that has beset United boss Louis van Gaal.

He cannot call on centre-halves Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Paddy McNair as well as striker Falcao. Michael Carrick is just coming back from long-term injury and would be a risk to start. On the plus side, skipper Wayne Rooney is back from suspension and he will be looking to add to his record tally of 11 goals in the Manchester derby.

Rojo, whose £16 million summer move from Sporting Lisbon was initially delayed because of work permits caused by an ongoing dispute in Argentina involving his family and neighbours, is happy to take on the responsibility in the middle.

‘The coach knows I’m very happy to play left or central,’ he stresses.

Unusually, United and City go into the derby having failed to win their last couple of games.

As champions, expectations are particularly high at City, who will be without playmaker David Silva who was injured in the disappointing midweek Capital One Cup defeat by Newcastle. 

This will also be City’s fourth game in 13 days whereas United have played only once in the corresponding period. It is a situation City manager Manuel Pellegrini accepts is not ideal, particularly with morale low after a midweek Capital One Cup exit, but he does not want his players to use it as an excuse.

‘Of course when you have the whole week to work for a game, maybe you can do it better,’ he accepts. ‘When you play every three days, you are just trying to recover as you can.

‘But last year we played a lot more games than Liverpool and we had an obligation to win. This year might be the same. We must play the amount of games we have to play and win the games. I never use excuses.’

City have been the dominant side in derbies for the past few seasons, their most notable victory being a 6-1 romp at Old Trafford in 2011. But their most recent successes were also 3-0 and 4-1.

‘I don’t think those scorelines are normal. Even half-nil would do this time,’ smiled the Chilean.

Perhaps the outcome will depend on the private battle between Aguero and Rojo.

They both grew up more than seven thousand miles away in Argentina, but on Sunday it is all about the pride of Manchester.

First-team players from both Manchester clubs were on hand to take part in a Premier League Kicks session between City in the Community and the Manchester United Foundation.
