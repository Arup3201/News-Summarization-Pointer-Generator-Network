At this time of year festive ice rinks are popping up in cities across the world.

But Paris takes first prize for their effort - a skating rink halfway up the Eiffel Tower. 

Offering magnificent views over the iconic city, for those who can stay on their feet, the rink is elevated 187ft off the ground on the tower's first floor and features a bar selling mulled wine and hot chocolate.

The ice rink, located on the first level of the Eiffel Tower, is open to the public as part of the festive season

A video clip of the attraction reveals that it is already a hit with tourists visiting the French capital.

'Skating on top of the Eiffel Tower is amazing, a lifetime experience. Yeah, really cool,' enthuses an Australian tourist named, Naomi. 

Access to the skating rink, which covers an area of 2,000 square feet, is free for everyone who has paid €9 (around £7) to go up in the tower, said its director of development and communication, Isabelle Esnous.

'This ice rink is a nice, fun space for all visitors to the Eiffel Tower, and for Parisians who want to come. 

'We try to install the ice rink every year, from the end of the year until mid-February, and it's just a bit of fun we offer to our visitors in addition to their visit to the Eiffel Tower,' she explains in the video clip.

The Eiffel Tower ice rink used to be open to tourists every year, but has been missing for the last two years due to a €30million restoration project to refurbish the tower's first floor.

The project involved building new visitors centres and restaurants as well as glass panels being installed in the floor to give visitors an adrenalin fix. Green energy systems were also installed.

The ice rink is open until February 15.
