He became an internet sensation after an unprompted interview in which he endearingly used the word 'apparently' eight times - without even knowing what it meant.

But apparently - adorable five-year-old, Noah Ritter, has a new favourite throwaway term - 'seriously'.

The charming ginger toddler appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show last night with the chat show hostess introducing him with 'apparently, our first guest is an internet sensation and apparently his video has over 15 million views, apparently'.

A smartly dressed Noah then swaggered on to the stage to the sound of exuberant cheering and clapping before embracing DeGeneres in his arms.

On cue, the toddler then trumpeted to the audience 'this is my first time on a talk show' before waving towards appreciative fans - he could have fooled us.

But the big news of the night was when he told the crowd that 'he got over' the word 'apparently'- whether he ever learned what it meant or how it is spelt is uncertain.

When asked what his new preferred word was, he jubilantly proclaimed 'seriously' before launching into an arm-waving celebration.

After achieving world-fame with his hilarious first interview with WNEP TV at the Wayne County Fair in Honesdale, Pennsylvania - Noah may struggle to reach such heights again with his new word.

Natural: Noah Ritter, five, found fame after an interview in which he repeatedly used the word 'apparently' - above, he explains on the Today show that he does not know what the word means

Noah Ritter became an internet sensation after an interview with WNEP TV last month.

A newscaster is seen approaching him on the opening day of the Wayne County Fair in Honesdale, Pennsylvania.

While reporter Sofia Ojeda was seeking a verdict on the ride he had just been on with his grandfather, Noah had his own agenda.

Exhibiting a fondness for the word 'apparently', he said: 'It was great and apparently I’ve never been on live television but apparently sometimes I don’t watch the news because I’m a kid and apparently every time Grandpa just gives me the remote I have to watch the Powerball.'

The preschooler was clearly excited to share his views, confidently holding the microphone and speaking in a somewhat newscaster-y voice.

Still attempting to get her soundbite, Ms Ojeda asked again how Noah had enjoyed his ride, only to get more of his adorable perspective on life. 

'Well, it was great because apparently you’re spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy, that’s all you do is get dizzy,' he said. 'I’ve never ever been on live television. I've never been on live television.'

The amused reporter, who is seen crouching down to speak at his level, asks: 'Are you excited?'

To which Noah replies: 'Yeah, and apparently I only went down the super slide. . . I was scared half to death. I just freak out.'

Noah used the word 'apparently' no less than eight times during the one-and-a-half-minute interview, and repeated that he had never been on live television three times.

Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, who had accompanied him to the fair, told ABC News: 'Noah is pretty talkative. He has a large vocabulary.'
