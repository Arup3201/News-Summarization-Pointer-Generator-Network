America's love affair with British Royalty continues as the second member of the Royal Family in as many weeks visits the States.

This time it was the turn of the Queen's youngest son, Prince Edward to receive a taste of Southern hospitality as he met some charming young ladies from Tennessee.

Governor Bill Haslam laid on the tea, crumpets and canapes followed by some hearty hamburgers and hot dogs whilst the prince chatted and joked with various beauty pageant winners.

The prince came to the aptly named Volunteer State as he took part in a tour to promote one of the British royal family's charities, the Duke of Edinburgh's Award.

The prince presided over an awards ceremony at the governor's mansion in Nashville for the first batch of young Tennesseans to participate in the leadership and character program.

He quipped that the participants were 'how should I put this - guinea pigs,' and then said, 'So you're leading the way here.'

'Welcome to an international family. It’s great to see Tennessee taking part in this program and supporting it so well.'

About 80 young people received the award by participating in community service, skills development, physical fitness and adventurous journeys through organizations such as the Boy Scouts, Boys and Girls Clubs and Miss Tennessee Scholarship Organization.

The Duke of Edinburgh's Award is a self-development program for people aged 14 to 25 that aims to instill confidence and skills.

The program in the U.S. was launched in 2007 and now operates in 30 states and the District of Columbia. The Nashville ceremony brought the program to Tennessee.

Following the event, Gov. Bill Haslam and first lady Crissy Haslam invited the awardees and their families to tea inside the governor's residence.

Last night, the prince headlined a black-tie Royal gala at Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville to raise funds for the award’s charities.
