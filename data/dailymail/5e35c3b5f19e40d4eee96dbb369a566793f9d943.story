A teenager, 16, mocked the two women Pcs shot dead in Manchester saying he wished they were stabbed because it would hurt more during a verbal rampage.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also racially abused an Asian officer after he was arrested with a ‘cosh-type’ bar hidden up his sleeve.

The boy taunted police about the deaths of Pcs Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, just five days after the pair was gunned down outside a house last month.

He said: ‘I wish they had been stabbed instead of shot to make it more painful.’

He also shouted praise for Dale Cregan, 28, the man charged with their murders, as he was held in custody at Ashton-under-Lyne police station in Greater Manchester.

The teenager was spotted by police acting suspiciously while riding a bike in Hyde and officers found the 12-inch bar hidden up his sleeve on September 23.

At the police station he punched and 
head-butted cell walls before being restrained by officers for his own 
safety. It was then that he hurled abuse at an Asian officer and made 
the insulting remarks about Pcs Bone and Hughes.

Taunting: The teenager's punishment comes weeks after Barry Thew was jailed for eight months for wearing a T-shirt with 'One less pig: Perfect justice' hand-written on it the same day the two women Pcs were killed

At Tameside youth court, the teenager 
admitted abusive behaviour, possessing an offensive weapon and using 
racially aggravated threatening behaviour.

His lawyer Asim Ali said: ‘He knows that what he said is completely out of order and something he would not wish to repeat.’

He
was ordered to help build a new memorial garden outside a police 
station in memory of the two policewomen as part of an 18-month 
community rehabilitation order.

The teenager will also complete 24 hours of unpaid work, observe a 7pm-7am curfew for three months and was banned from an area of Dukinfield.

His punishment comes just weeks after Barry Thew, 39, was jailed for eight months for wearing a T-shirt with ‘One less pig: Perfect justice’ hand-written on it the same day the two women Pcs were killed. 

Thew, of Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, admitted a Section 4A Public Order Offence (displaying writing or other visible representation with intention of causing harassment, alarm or distress) and was sentenced at Minshull Street Crown Court on October 11.

The memorial garden dedicated to Pcs Bone and Hughes is expected to be built outside Hyde Police Station and is expected to be completed by November.

The family of Pc Hughes publicly thanked police and the public for the support they have shown following the deaths of the two officers.

In a statement they said: ‘We would like
to express our sincere thanks and gratitude to everyone who has 
supported our family following the death of our beloved Nicola.

‘The level of support shown to us as a
family from both the people of Manchester and the public in general has
been overwhelming and heart-warming.

‘Greater
Manchester Police have been extremely supportive in a sensitive and 
professional manner during the past four weeks and continue to be.

‘The amount of support shown in public 
and towards us in private by other police forces from around the country
would have made Nicola immensely proud to have been part of this 
extended family.

‘Whilst we
continue to grieve for our beautiful daughter and come to terms with 
our tragic loss, we would also like to take this opportunity to thank 
everyone who has paid tributes, sent cards and flowers and messages of 
support or merely stood at the roadside and demonstrated dignity and 
respect towards Nicola.

‘We continue to draw strength from the immense support demonstrated by you all.’
