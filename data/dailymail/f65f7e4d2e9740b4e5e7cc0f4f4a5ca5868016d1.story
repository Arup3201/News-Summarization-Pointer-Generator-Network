Woody Allen's stepdaughter accused him of sexual assault after the idea was planted in her mind by her mother Mia Farrow during their acrimonious relationship, his attorney has claimed.

Elkan Abramowitz appeared on the Today show on Tuesday - three days after Dylan Farrow, now 28, penned an open letter in the New York Times claiming Allen sexually assaulted her at age seven.

'I think it's part of Mia Farrow's desire to hurt Woody Allen,' Abramowitz told the Today show.

'His reaction is one of overwhelming sadness because of what has happened to Dylan. She was a pawn in a huge fight between him and Mia years ago. The idea that she was molested was implanted in her mind by her mother.

Denial: Woody Allen's attorney Elkan Abramowitz told the Today show the filmmaker's adopted daughter only accused him of sexual assault because the idea was planted in her mind by her mother Mia Farrow

Abramowitz, speaking to Savannah Guthrie, said Allen was 'overwhelmingly sad' about the accusations

'[Dylan]'s not lying, she truly believes this happened. That's what the vice of this is - when you implant a story in the mind of a fragile seven-year-old... it never goes away.'

Abramowitz added that the accusations were resurfacing now, 20 years on, because Allen's Golden Globe lifetime achievement award had 'revived the anger [Mia Farrow] has towards him'.

Dylan Farrow's gut-wrenching first-person account, which was published online on Saturday, marked the first time she directly addressed the alleged sex abuse.

She explained how, at age seven, her adoptive father, Allen, allegedly led her by the hand to a dim attic on the second floor of their house.

'He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set,' Miss Farrow wrote.

'Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we'd go to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies.'

Farrow went on to describe how the 
award-winning director of 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan' would always find
 a way to touch her and do things to her she did not like, including 
sticking his thumb in her mouth, forcing her to get into bed with him 
and placing his head in her naked lap.

'I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different,' she said.

What followed next was a drawn-out process in which Dylan was dragged from one psychologist to the next, recounting her story over and over again to see if she was lying.

In the end, Allen was denied visitation rights with his children, but a Connecticut prosecutor declined to charge him, saying that while there was enough evidence for the case to potentially stand up in court, he was dropping criminal proceedings due to Dylan's fragile state.

Farrow and Allen separated after Farrow 
found nude photographs that Allen had taken of Farrow's adopted daughter
 from a previous relationship, Soon-Yi Previn, when she was 20.

Denial: Allen, pictured Monday, has denied the accusations, which he found 'overwhelmingly sad'

Allen, 78, has always denied the allegations of sexual abuse against Dylan. He was never charged with, or convicted of, a crime in this case.

Allen's publicist, Leslee Dart, said the director read the article 'and found it untrue and disgraceful'.

The case is over,' Abramowitz added on the Today show on Tuesday. 'There is no case.'

Despite Allen's vehement denial, the accusations have caused outrage and division among Hollywood including Lena Dunham, who urged her 1.3 million Twitter followers to read Farrow's letter.

'To share in this way is courageous, powerful and generous,' Dunham wrote

Farrow's family, including her mother and stepbrother Ronan Farrow, have also been unwavering in their support of her.

On the night of the Golden Globes 
ceremony, Ronan Farrow, Allen's would-be son, brought up his sister's 
alleged assault in a scathing tweet.

'Missed
 the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly 
confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?' the 
newly hired MSNBC host wrote.

But on Monday, Barbara Walters came to Allen's support on The View.

The
 84-year-old co-creator of The View opened the discussion after Whoopi 
Goldberg introduced the topic. Walters pointed out that the statute of 
limitations had run out.

'I've been with Woody many times with 
his two daughters,' Walters said referencing time spent with Allen, his wife Soon-Yi Previn and their two adopted teenage daughters,
 Bechet and Manzie.

Spirited debate: Sherri Shepherd challenged Walter's defense of Allen

'I have rarely seen a father as 
sensitive, as loving and as caring as Woody is and Soon-Yi to these two 
girls. I don't know about Dylan. I can only tell you what I have seen 
now,' Walters said.

Walters said that Dylan was 
'supposedly very angry' and made the child abuse allegations because 
Allen was up for a Best Original Screenplay at the Academy 
Awards for his comedy Blue Jasmine.

But the
 View's Sherri Shepherd, 46, challenged Walters by pointing out 
that many people accused of crimes are often described as 'the most 
wonderful person.'

'That's not what I'm saying,' Walters shot back.

McCarthy also said the child abuse 
claim wasn't so far-fetched since Allen started a relationship with 
Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi when he was 56 and she was 19.

'But it was mutual,' Walters countered. 'He married her. They've been married for 20 years.'
