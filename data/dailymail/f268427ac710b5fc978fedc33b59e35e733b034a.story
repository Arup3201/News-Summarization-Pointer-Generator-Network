Despite the rusting hull and tired façade, she retains a majesty which hints to untrained observers of her importance to history.

But veterans of HMS Plymouth - the Royal Navy warship where the Argentinians formally surrendered during the Falklands War - have said their final goodbye to the 53-year-old vessel after it emerged she is to be scrapped.

In a moving ceremony last month, more than 50 seamen who served on the 2,150-ton frigate, launched in Plymouth in 1959, paid their last respects at Vittoria Dock, Birkenhead, where she has been moored for the past decade.

Inside the vessel, little has been touched since she was decommissioned in 1988. Papers and naval charts remain laid out for review beside old fashioned equipment

Neatly folded bunk beds, papers and naval charts remain laid out for review beside old fashioned type writers and equipment.

There are even untouched Pepsi cola cans and Marathon chocolate bars in the sailors' tuck shop.

But the ordinariness of the interior belies the historic events which took place inside the frigate, which, 30 years ago, was where notorious Argentinian navy lieutenant and intelligence officer Alfredo Astiz - the so-called ‘Blond Angel of Death’ - surrendered to British forces in South Georgia.

Her loyal crew, who formed the HMS 
Plymouth Association, had hoped to save the ship, which also survived an
 air attack in the 1982 war, and preserve her as a piece of national 
heritage.

But they reluctantly admitted defeat after the current owners agreed to sell her to a Turkish recycling firm.

If the Government agree to rubber stamp the deal, she is likely to be dismantled and turned into anything from razor blades to steel girders.

The service included a message from Captain David Pentreath, the ship’s Commanding Officer during the Falklands War, who said: ‘Her spirit will survive and the friendships forged over her long life will continue to flourish.

‘Sadly the ship is now showing her age, but her reputation as a happy and successful ship is as strong as ever.

‘This day is tinged with sadness as you make your fond farewells.’

Captain Pentreath previously condemned the decision to scrap HMS Plymouth, saying it was ‘an indication our country doesn’t seem to have much interest in the preservation of maritime heritage.’

HMS Plymouth played a key role in winning the Falklands War, destroying an Argentinian submarine and five enemy aircraft - firing 900 shells in total - despite coming under significant attack.

Martin Slater, 62, secretary of the HMS Plymouth Association, who served on the frigate as a signalman from 1971 to 1973, said: ‘We think it is very insensitive to scrap Plymouth during the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War.

‘She was at the forefront of the battle to repel the Argentine forces and despite taking a hammering in return she was still capable of causing considerable damage.

‘But ultimately she is a symbol to those who lost their lives for their country and the rest of us who survive.’
