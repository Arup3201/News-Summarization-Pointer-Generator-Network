Xabi Alonso insists he is still hungry for success at Bayern Munich despite two Champions League wins, a World Cup victory and two European championship titles.

The 32-year-old Spaniard surprisingly joined Bayern on Friday on a two-year deal from Real Madrid and said it was his desire to keep playing and winning that led him to the 2013 Champions League winners.

'I thought I needed a new challenge and there is nothing bigger than playing for Bayern,' Alonso said on Sunday, a day after his Bayern debut in their 1-1 draw against Schalke.

'This was a huge opportunity for me. I talked with (coach) Pep Guardiola and he explained what he wants from me. I felt this hunger inside me that is necessary to play football and that is why I am here.'

The midfielder, who won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005 and Real Madrid last season, showed he needed no time to settle in, playing a near flawless first half at Schalke on Saturday with the more ball touches than any other Bayern player in the opening period.

Alonso, brought in as a defensive midfield option after injuries to Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thiago Alcantara and Javi Martinez, had only signed for the club on Friday.

'True, the first days were a bit intense. I had to fly back to Madrid to bid farewell to the club and fans and then I flew back and played my first game yesterday,' he said.

'Everything happened so quickly but it all went well. The 1-1 draw may not be the best result for us but I am happy to have had my debut.'
