QPR manager Harry Redknapp has expressed his delight at the imminent signing of Lassana Diarra.

The 67-year-old has been on the lookout for another midfielder ever since Alejandro Faurlin picked up a long-term knee injury last week, and Diarra, who is available on a free, fits the bill.

Redknapp confirmed Diarra had passed a medical on Saturday morning following his side's win against Sunderland, with the former Chelsea midfielder in the stands for the game.

He later told West London Sport: ‘It was a cheap deal for the club – a great deal – and the chairman’s done a fantastic job.

‘Diarra just wanted to come and play here and, without wanting to blow my own trumpet, I think he wanted to come back and play for me.

‘He enjoyed his time with me at Portsmouth and I enjoyed my time with him so he really wanted to come here.

‘There were other clubs in for him but he said to me "It’s not the money, I want to play here"'

The 29-year-old, who turned down a late offer from Roma to join the R's, played under Redknapp at Portsmouth.
