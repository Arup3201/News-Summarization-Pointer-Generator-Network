A 17-year-old boy has become the latest to die from taking the legal high AMT after buying it online from Holland.

The teenager died yesterday morning following four days in intensive care at Southampton General Hospital after consuming the drug known as alpha-methyltryptamine (AMT).

The teenager’s mother found him 'in a bad way' in his bedroom and dialled 999. He was rushed into intensive care and placed in a medically-induced coma after swallowing the pill last Wednesday.

The boy, from Southampton, Hampshire, has not yet been named.

Tragedy: A 17-year-old boy placed in an induced coma for four days has died in hospital after apparently taking a legal high he bought online

His death comes a little over a month after medical student Doug Ferguson, 19, died after apparently taking the drug while celebrating the end of his university year.

Friends of the student, from Chandler's Ford, Hampshire, called 999 in the early hours of the morning and he was taken to hospital, but doctors were unable to save him.

A 33-year-old man from Andover also died last year after apparently taking the drug. 

AMT, which was originally produced as an anti-depressant, can be bought online for just £30 a gram.

Users experience a state of euphoria and increased energy levels. But the drug has devastating side effects, including paranoia and aggressive behaviour..

Hampshire Police Detective Constable Jonathan Hyland warned people about the consequences of taking legal highs.

He said: 'The clear issue is people who state they have a strong view about not taking controlled drugs are importing and purchasing drugs they read on-line are a substitute for controlled drugs.

'People incorrectly believe these "legal highs" are then both safe and appropriate alternatives to street drugs.

'Just because something is not illegal does not make it safe.

'Unfortunately, it appears anyone can call anything a "legal high" and sell it as "safe".

'It only becomes clear it is not safe when someone becomes severely harmed by taking it and subsequent investigations reveal substances within the compound can be lethal.

'This is the third exceptionally serious case involving AMT in Hampshire since 2012.

'If you are considering taking any type of non personally prescribed drug, I would urge you to consider for a few minutes before you use the substance.

'Think about how your family would feel, finding you in need of critical medical attention.'
