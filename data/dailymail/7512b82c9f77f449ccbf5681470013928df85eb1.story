Another year, another outing with Professor Layton and his assistant Luke. This time, they’re joined by Layton's friend, Emmy, as they chase a mysterious criminal called the Masked Gentleman.

Armed with the (appropriately named) Mask of Chaos, he attacks a carnival, turning some of the crowd into stone, before making some paintings at the nearby gallery spring to life.

Wonderful: The beautiful cutscenes are reason alone to check out the Professor's latest adventure

Gameplay is as expected, combining both screens to solve a series of puzzles. Thankfully, there’s enough variation to keep things feeling fresh. Puzzles range from simple ‘join-the-dots’-style outings, to the vastly more enjoyable brain teasers.

Indeed, some are so difficult that you'll spend hours trying to figure it out, only to realise the solution is actually quite simple.

If you get stuck, there is a hint system, although you have to search different environments to find Hint coins to pay for these. 

There is also the option to revisit puzzles when completed, but it never quite works given that you can remember the solution.

The real star of the show, though, are the game’s visuals. The 3D works brilliantly, and the cutscenes are strong enough to be a standalone feature.

There’s a real sense that you’re playing through something special, the charming hand-drawn artwork adequately masking perhaps a slight lack of gameplay innovation.

Dialogue is delivered through both spoken and written means, which keeps the narrative ticking along, but some may find it’s a bit too wordy at times. The chirpy, albeit, slightly samey soundtrack may start to grate after a while, too.

But this is another brilliant entry into the series, proving that the Professor’s winning formula has lost none of its charm.
