While it may seem like everyone's on Tinder these days, if you're a mass murdering Nazi - who has been dead fifty years - then you might have thought your chances of securing a date are rather slim.

But it seems not. One old romantic has signed up to the dating app as a 22-year-old Adolf Hitler - and a surprising amount of women are swiping right.

Returning from beyond the grave and into the world of internet dating, Hitler describes himself as 'selfish, impatient and a little insecure about having only one testicle'.

'I make mistakes,' he adds. 'But if you can't handle me at my worst you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.'

He also - with questionable taste - promises to be 'the Final Solution to your loneliness'.

Tinder is a popular dating app where strangers who are in close proximity can 'like' a profile by swiping right. If the person in the profile swipes right too then the couple are able to chat via the app. 

Despite his less-than-flawless credentials, the German dictator appears to be enjoying more than his fair share of success on the dating app.

One woman messages him saying: I knew it would be a good idea to swipe you right.'

To which he replies: 'Lol I shouldn't have swiped across Europe. Those damn Russians.'

Little is known about the person who took it upon himself to pose as the man responsible for the extermination of six million Jews, but it is thought that he has been on the app as Hitler for about one month.

But, as for the real Hitler, he had a surprising amount of success with the opposite sex. He was believed to have had a number of girlfriends, including two fiancées, and was married to Eva Braun, albeit rather briefly.

But as The Daily Dot points out, it's probably worth noting two of his former lovers committed suicide and two others made attempts - so whether it's 1945 or 2014, dating the dictator might not be such a good idea after all.
