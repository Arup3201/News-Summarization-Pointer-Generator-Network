Row: Toulouse and Algeria have both rejected Mohammed Merah's body, leaving a dilemma as to where he will be buried

Al Qaeda gunman Mohammed Merah has today been buried outside the French city of Toulouse.

A police helicopter buzzed overhead and around 100 policemen stood 
guard as the serial killer was laid to rest in the Cornebarrieu 
cemetery.

According to reports, his body was accompanied by around 15 men whose
 identities were unknown, but were said to be unrelated to the Merah.

'Nobody from the family is there, not the mother, not the brothers, 
not the sisters,' Abdallah Zekri of the Muslim Council of France, who 
helped organise the burial, told Le Figaro.

One of the mourners told the paper: 'We came because he has the right
 to be buried and accompanied by his friends like anyone else, even if 
some people say he is a criminal.'

The funeral comes despite Toulouse's Mayor Pierre Cohen saying it would 
be 'inappropriate' to lay Merah to rest in the city where he mercilessly 
gunned down four Jews and three soldiers in a two-week long terror 
campaign.

The government of his home country of Algeria, where today's burial had been scheduled to take place, also banned 
him from being laid to rest there over 'security concerns'.

And to further compound matters, French President Nicolas Sarkozy 
confusingly told television reporters the 23-year-old should be allowed 
to be buried in the country where he committed his crimes.

The row came as French police today said they were urgently seeking a 'Third Man' who may have helped Merah murder his seven victims.

His brother, Abdelkader Merah, was charged on Sunday in connection with the terrorist crimes which took place across the south west of the country this month.

And, during hours of interrogation, he has admitted that another man was involved – a claim which is being backed up by growing evidence.

Abdelkader, 29, said that the man was in a car with the two brothers when they bought the T-Max scooter used by Merah to travel to and from the murder scenes.

‘He has not told us the name of the man,’ said a judicial source. ‘But he is actively being sought as a matter of urgency’.

Intriguingly, investigators have now discovered a stolen white Renault Clio containing parts of the motorbike and the crash helmet used Merah.

The car was found abandoned some 80 miles from the council house in Toulouse where Merah was shot dead by special forces police a week ago.

If a third man is indeed still on the loose, it raises the terrifying possibility that he could still be an active terrorist preparing to strike again.

Merah, who claimed to have links to Al-Qaeda, was killed after a 32-hour siege.

Video footage shot by Merah shows him killing three French soldiers and four people at a Jewish school.

It is currently in the hands of the Al Jazeera TV channel, but they have agreed not to broadcast it following complaints by the French government.

It also comes as France has barred a group of Muslim clerics, including one of the most prominent voices in Sunni Islam, from entering the country to attend a conference.

France's foreign ministry said today the clerics were invited by the French Islamic Union to speak next month at a congress near Paris.

One of those barred, the Egyptian-born Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, says he refuses to come to France. Tensions are high in France after Merah murders.

The foreign ministry said in a statement that 'these people call for hatred and violence and seriously violate the principles of the Republic, and in the current context, seriously risk disrupting public order.'
