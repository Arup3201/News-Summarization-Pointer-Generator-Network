Hospital bosses have had to rename a computer system in case patients think they are being insulted.

Staff at Addenbrooke's in Cambridge have introduced 'Computers on Wheels' – affectionately known as CoWs – on to their wards.

But the machines, which are used to review test results at the bedside, are being renamed amid concerns staff shouting 'Bring that cow over here' might alarm patients.

An Addenbrooke's spokesman said: 'Computer on Wheels is now Workstation on Wheels or WoW to prevent any unwitting offence to patients.'

Ruth Rogers, chairman of Healthwatch Cambridgeshire, which campaigns to improve patient care, said: 'Some patients might think it's funny and some might not be too pleased. There is a big push on treating patients with dignity.'

The mobile computers were first trialled on the wards in 2010 and the hospital claimed they enabled, 'faster diagnosis and treatment for all concerned', and ordered ten more. 

One hospital insider suggested the change was because the staff had issues with the system.

The staff member, who did not wish to be named, said: 'We were all given orders that from now on we have to call Cow, WoW.

'We were told the reason for the change was because staff hated the system and kept saying it was a right cow to work with.'
