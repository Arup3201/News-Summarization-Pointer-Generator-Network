An Australian man whose wife died in a horror bus crash in Kenya has been left stranded at a remote hospital.

On Sunday, Richard King and his wife, Olga, were travelling with 20 other tourists and three Intrepid Travel tour guides on a bus when it overturned and plunged into a nearby creek, west of the nation's capital of Nairobi.

Local police identified the dead as Ms King, who was in her 60s, and an Australian man. One of the victims died on the spot, Kenyan media said.

The other passengers were taken to the Narok Country Hospital - where Mr King remains.

The crash happened just outside the city of Nairobi in the East African country of Kenya

Narok County Governor Samuel ole Tunai (arms outstretched) visited the injured tourists in hospital.

The Melbourne civil engineer told The Daily Telegraph from his hospital bed that he had not heard from Australian authorities since the crash.

'I am here by myself. I have broken ribs and a dislocated collarbone,' he said.

Mr King said he and his wife - who had worked at Medicare in Bentleigh located in Melbourne's east - were in Kenya to mark the start of their retirement with a safari trip they had always dreamed of taking.

The Kings' son is doctor in Port Macquarie on New South Wales' central coast and has expressed his displeasure.

Adam King said his father was well enough to be moved.

'I would have thought the relative of one of the deceased should be a priority,' he told The Daily Telegraph.

The Narok County Government said the spouses of the dead Australians were among those admitted to hospital.

They suffered injuries and 'deep shock', a statement said.

The local government released images of officials visiting the wounded at Narok County Referral Hospital on its Facebook page.

Eighteen of the injured and all Intrepid Tours staff have now been flown to Nairobi for treatment.

In a statement released to Daily Mail Australia, James Thornton, the managing director of the Melbourne-based Intrepid Tours said:

'Our first concern is with those affected and their friends and families,' he said.

'Senior managers from our operations team in Kenya are assisting passengers and staff involved.'

County police commander Paul Kerich told local newspaper The Standard that the bus, which was carrying three staff and 22 tourists, was en route to Tanzania.

He described the crash zone was a renowned black spot.

'There are a lot of sharp bends and steep depressions a long this road,' Mr Kerich said.

'We want to appeal to drivers especially those who are new to exercise caution so as to avoid unnecessary deaths.'

The tourists on board were from the United Kingdom, the U.S., Germany, Switzerland and Australia.

Kenyan roads have a poor reputation. Last August, 41 people were killed in a bus crash in the same area as this latest incident.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters the crash was tragic.

'It's awful beyond belief for the families of those involved,' he said on Monday morning.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular support to the families of those affected.
