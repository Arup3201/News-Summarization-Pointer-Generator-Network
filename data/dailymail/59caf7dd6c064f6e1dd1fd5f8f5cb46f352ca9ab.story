Mirka Federer perched on a bench next to Court No 4 a fortnight ago and took the chance to add to the family album. Using her phone she snapped away, smiling and waiting for the right shots.

Neither of her two sets of twins were around, nor were many others. Just the greatest player in the history of tennis and Stanislas Wawrinka, his Swiss compatriot and hitting partner that day. So she clicked away.

Roger Federer, worth 17 Grand Slam titles and an estimated £140million, likes such keepsakes. These next couple of years are the final throes for a man one month short of his 33rd birthday, who recently told his Swiss biographer of his wish ‘to be 25 again so I had another 10 years of tennis’.

He had a smile on his face as he said it, just as he did when he joked to the same author that he might one day return to Wimbledon as a fan, camping in a tent and waiting in the queue for tickets.

The smiles, according to those who know him, are the answers to questions of what has motivated him to continue during his two-year Grand Slam drought, with a legacy supposedly at stake and his ranking slipping.

He fell to eighth, his second-round loss here last year perhaps the biggest indignity. Why hang on as a shadow of your former self? On Thursday, he was back at Court No 4, a Wimbledon semi-finalist having a hit before stepping in front of Milos Raonic on Friday afternoon.

The practice session was tame; the crowd enormous. When it was over, five security guards formed a protective cordon around the ageing tennis player with the dodgy back. Occasionally, he stopped his escort for a high five with the fans, a great of sport having the time of his second life.

Dominant: Federer is back to his best after a nightmare 2013

How he has fought his way back into prominence — and the top four — after the nightmares of 2013, is a tale of nannies, coaches and physiotherapy; it’s a comeback supported further by private planes, Mirka’s diary and, simply, a love for the game.

Tim Henman is one of his closer friends in tennis and has watched as Federer recovered from his 2013 season, in which serious back injuries limited him to a single title — his worst return since 2001.

‘It is amazing to me,’ Henman said. ‘I was a similar age when I stopped. For the first time ever it was my job not my hobby.

'For me, when I look at him I see how much he enjoys it. I honestly think it is about his personal enjoyment of tennis. The challenge was last year. That is when you, or he, would really question it. But he has the hunger.

‘I was speaking recently to Josh Eagle (Australia’s Davis Cup coach) and he was telling me Nick Kyrgios went to practise with Federer for a week in Switzerland. Apparently his work rate was incredible, the intensity of it. That is a guy who has nothing to prove. Those are the standards he sets.’

They are standards maintained in the organisation of his private life, driven by a wife who is said to apply extreme precision to the running of his domestic affairs.

When Federer travelled to the French Open three weeks after the birth of his second set of twins, it is understood all four children joined him in Paris. A private plane and airstrip are understood to have been used, with five nannies part of the entourage. It is believed to be a regular arrangement.

‘Mirka keeps the whole thing together and oversees the organising of their life,’ said Rene Stauffer, his biographer.

Mental toughness: Federer has hired Stefan Edberg as his coach

‘Roger loves everything in tennis. He says when he stops playing he’ll come back here one day and wants to be a supporter. He joked he wants to sleep in a tent and queue. But Mirka is the person in the background who I think keeps it going smoothly for him now.’

On the court, Federer is now using a bigger racket for a greater margin of error and has hired Stefan Edberg as a coach to freshen his mental approach.

His schedule was also reworked. It is understood Federer is worth £600,000 a time on the exhibition circuit, which is how he spent his off-season in December 2012. Last winter, he went to Dubai to train.

‘I believe I worked the hardest from the top eight in the off-season,’ Federer told Sportsmail earlier this year.

But can he win another Grand Slam? It is a tough ask for a father of four, as John McEnroe illustrated this week.

‘I found it extremely difficult to juggle the responsibilities and joys of children,’ McEnroe said.

‘With  trying to be a good father and trying to stave off that  inevitable decline, I didn’t do nearly as good a job as Federer does.’

Indeed, since 1990 only eight Slams have been won by fathers. Twice it was Federer. With two more children it is tougher again. But when has Federer ever been like the rest?
