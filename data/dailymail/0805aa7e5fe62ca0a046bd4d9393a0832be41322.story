Planning minister Nick Boles said areas such as the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor were in danger of becoming ¿embalmed¿

Strict planning rules protecting national parks are to be reviewed, after a minister claimed that beauty spots are being turned into ‘museum pieces’.

Planning minister Nick Boles said areas such as the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor were in danger of becoming ‘embalmed’ because of the special planning laws that have protected them from unsightly developments for decades.

Mr Boles told MPs yesterday he was asking his officials to ‘work up proposals’ for reform following complaints from developers and business that planning rules in national parks are an ‘obstacle’ to economic recovery in the countryside. 

He wants to examine ‘the balance between growth, economic and social development and the protection of the landscape, and whether current legislation properly captures what we are trying to achieve’.

Rural campaigners last night accused Mr Boles of ‘peddling misconceptions’ about national parks – and warned he would have a fight on his hands if he attempted to tear up their special protections.

His comments will also alarm the millions who visit the country’s 15 national parks.

Mr Boles has infuriated campaigners – and irritated many Tory MPs – with a string of outspoken comments on the planning system.

Within weeks of being appointed in September last year, he attacked the National Trust and others as ‘latter-day Luddites’ for opposing all building on the Green Belt.

In November, he suggested two million acres of greenfield land would have to be sacrificed to satisfy housing demand, almost half of it driven by immigration.

Speaking in the Commons yesterday, Mr Boles said it was right that national parks had ‘slightly different’ planning rules in recognition of their status as ‘some of the most beautiful parts of the country’. 

But there was a ‘danger of making rural communities into museum pieces, not so much protected as embalmed’.

The comments made by Nick Boles will also alarm the millions who visit the country¿s 15 national parks

‘That applies to many communities within national parks – they will retain their life and appeal only if they are allowed to change and develop, and if people can get jobs and set up businesses.

‘That is a necessary underpinning to national parks, not just as wildernesses, but as living, breathing sets of communities.’ 

National parks have their own planning authorities which are exempt from the sweeping planning reforms brought in by the Coalition in a bid to boost growth.

Emma Marrington, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, condemned Mr Boles’s comments and warned against any change to protections afforded to national parks.

She said national parks received 90million visitors a year, generating more than £10billion in revenue.

She added: ‘These figures suggest that instead of national park status being a block to small businesses, they attract more money into the local economy.

‘Far from national park being museum pieces, they are exemplars of sustainable development.

‘Many of the misconceptions being peddled in the debate today – and there were quite a few – were not based on the evidence. 

‘They were an assault on the essence of what makes our national parks special.’
