Shakira, currently pregnant with her second child, has partnered with Fisher-Price to launch a line of baby toys.

The Mattel-owned company announced Friday that the First Steps collection of toys and baby gear will be available in November. 

Shakira, who is mom to 21-month-old son Milan, co-developed six products, including a bouncer that plays music, alphabet blocks and a musical soccer ball, an ode to her soccer-playing boyfriend Gerard Pique, who plays for FC Barcelona.

Geoff Walker, executive vice president of the Fisher-Price Global Brands Team, said in an interview Thursday that Shakira contacted the company about collaborating. 

'She brings in both authenticity and emotion, and I think that's why this is such an exciting moment,' Mr Walker said.

With her foundation, one of Shakira's main initiatives has been early childhood development, which attracted Fisher-Price to the global star, Mr Walker said.

'I saw how important developmental milestones are and how toys can help babies reach them - including with my own son,' Shakira said in a statement. 

'I wanted to design a line of toys that stimulated development in the crucial early stages of life, the stages in which learning can be achieved through supervised play, fostering the development of psychological, social and motor skills.'

Shakira will also debut a 12-part web series Monday, which will target millennial moms. Some of the episodes, three to five minutes long, will feature her son.

Shakira is one of the most popular celebrities on social media. She is the first person to reach 100 million likes on Facebook.

Mr Walker said as a result of the collaboration, Fisher-Price would be open to more celebrity partnerships.

'It's about finding an authentic mom that is relevant to the millennial crowd,' he said.
