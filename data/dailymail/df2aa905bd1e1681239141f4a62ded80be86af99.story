The father of a Jordanian pilot captured by Islamic State militants in Syria has pleaded for his son's release.

Safi Yousef al-Kaseasbeh, speaking to reporters in the Jordanian capital Amman on Thursday, also urged the militants to show 'hospitality' toward his son. He pleaded for good treatment, reminding the militants that his son was a Muslim, the same faith as the ultraconservative group.

He said: 'Now he is in the hands of Islamic State fighters and I do not want to describe him as a hostage. I call him a guest. He is a guest among brothers of ours in Syria's Islamic State.

'I ask them in the name of God, and I ask with the dignity of the prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, to receive him as a guest at his hosts' and treat him well.' He added: 'We are all Muslims.'

The pilot, 1st Lt. Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh, was captured after his warplane crashed in the militant stronghold of Raqqa on Wednesday while carrying out airstrikes against the militant group.There has been no word on his fate since his capture.

Mr al-Kaseasbeh said his wife was 'devastated' when told that the terrorists had seized their son, according to Al Arabiya News. 

Jordanian Information Minister Mohammad Momani told The Associated Press that the plane was shot down by 'ground fire' but did not elaborate.

But last night, the US dismissed claims Isis were responsible for bringing the aircraft down.

It was the first instance of a foreign soldier falling into the group's hands since the U.S.-led coalition began its air campaign against the extremists. 

The plea from the pilot's father came as distraught relatives gathered outside the family home and at the tribe's chamber to hear the latest news about him and to discuss what can be done to save him.

The Raqqa Media Center published a photograph said to be of the pilot - in a white shirt, naked from the waist down and sopping wet - being pulled by gunmen out of what appeared to be a lake.

Another picture shows him surrounded by more than a dozen fighters, some of them masked. The center said IS fighters are scouring the area in case there is a second pilot.

A coalition official, who was not authorised to discuss the episode publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the pilot was in an F-16 fighter and was able to eject.

U.S. Central Command, the body overseeing the coalition air war over Iraq and Syria, said last night: 'Evidence clearly indicates that ISIL did not down the aircraft as the terrorist organisation is claiming.'

The statement did not give a cause for the 'crash,' and confirmed the lost jet's Jordanian pilot had been taken captive by IS guerrillas.

'We strongly condemn the actions of ISIL, which has taken captive the downed pilot,' said CentCom commander General Lloyd Austin.

'We will support efforts to ensure his safe recovery, and will not tolerate ISIL's attempts to misrepresent or exploit this unfortunate aircraft crash for their own purposes.

'The Jordanians are highly respected and valued partners and their pilots and crews have performed exceptionally well over the course of this campaign,' he added.

The pilot's capture raises a nightmare scenario for Jordan, which has been sharply criticized by militant sympathizers for its participation. IS in the past has beheaded dozens of Syrian soldiers it captured in operations around the country. The group has also beheaded three Americans and two Britons.

Mu'ath Safi al-Kaseasbeh is the first foreign military member to fall into Isis' hands since an international coalition launched its bombing campaign against the group months ago. The pilot's clan gathered last night to discuss the crisis

Jordan's military said in a statement that as its air force was carrying out a military mission against the Islamic State group Wednesday morning, 'one of our warplanes crashed,' it said. 'The pilot was taken hostage by the Daesh terrorist organization,' it added, using the Arabic acronym for the Isalmic State group.

It said IS and 'those who support it' will be responsible for the safety of the pilot.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had confirmation from activists on the ground that the aircraft was shot down.

Earlier Independent Defence Analyst Paul Beaver warned that Isis is capable of downing warplanes.

He told MailOnline: 'Isis do have the capability to hit aircraft, as they have surface-to-air missiles and heavy machine guns.'

It was not immediately known how the fighters shot down the warplane. But the Islamic State group is known to have stocks of Russian-made Igla anti-aircraft missiles.

The shoulder-fired weapon has long been in the Syrian and Iraqi government arsenals - it was used during the 1991 Gulf War by Iraqi forces to down a British Tornado jet, for example. More recently, militants in Chechnya have used them to down Russian helicopters.

The Raqqa Media Center, an agency of activists that operates openly in IS-ruled areas with permission of the group, said the plane was downed near the village of Hamra Ghannam outside Raqqa.

It posted photos of militants posing with shards of wreckage and the canopy being loaded onto a van and then placed in the centre of Raqqa seemingly as a trophy.

It also posted a phot of the pilot's military identification card, identifying him as First Lieutenant Mu'ath Safi Yousef al-Kaseasbeh, aged 27.

In October it was reported that Isis is now in possession of MANPADS - shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles

In Jordan, the pilot's cousin Marwan al-Kaseasbeh confirmed by telephone with The Associated Press that the photos are of his cousin.

A friend said Kasaesbeh, who is from a prominent Jordanian family, was fervent in his commitment to his mission and felt it was a religious duty to fight extremist groups such as Islamic State that were 'distorting the true spirit of Islam'.

Momani said al-Kaseasbeh, who got married in July, was 'a symbol of heroism and sacrifice'. He added that 'the war on terrorism will continue', saying that the fight with the extremists was 'to defend the Islamic religion'.

The United States and several Arab allies have been striking the Islamic State group in Syria since September 23, and U.S. and other international warplanes have been waging an air campaign against the extremists in Iraq for even longer.

The campaign aims to push back the jihadi organization after it took over much of Iraq and Syria and declared a 'caliphate.'

Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates are participating in the Syria strikes, with Qatari logistical support.

Staunch U.S. ally Jordan has provided a logistics base for the U.S.-led air campaign and is a hub for intelligence-gathering operations against the jihadists, a western diplomatic source said.

King Abdullah has been in the forefront of regional U.S. allies supportive of the campaign but has said radical Sunni extremists cannot defeated by military means alone and their ideology must be confronted with reason.

In Washington, a Pentagon official said they are aware of the claims being made over social media that a pilot has been shot down, but they could not confirm the report at this time.

The official said any further questions about the alleged capture should be referred to the government of Jordan. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the reports by name.

Over the past week, Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters have been battling Isis to liberate the town of Sinjar, a tiny desert community in northern Iraq that the gunmen overran in August, massacring and enslaving hundreds of its residents.

The Islamic State group swept into Sinjar and surrounding villages as part of their summer blitz across northern Iraq.

The advance of the extremists struck particular fear there. Much of the population belongs to the minority Yazidi religious community, a tiny sect that the Sunni Muslim radicals consider heretics.

Hundreds were killed, and hundreds more Yazidi women and girls were taken captive by the militants, turned into sex slaves or forcibly 'married' to Islamic State supporters in Syria and Iraq.

Thousands of other Yazidis fled into Mount Sinjar, a long, steep mountain range that erupts from the flat desert landscape and looms over the town. There they languished for weeks with little food or protection until they were rescued, many by Syrian Kurds who freed a corridor to reach them.

Now, Iraqi Kurdish fighters are on an offensive to push back the Islamic State in this corner of Iraq near the Syrian border.

Meanwhile, officials say a suicide attack against pro-government, anti-Islamic State group Sunni militias near Baghdad has killed at least 13 people.

A police officer says the attacker blew himself up early Wednesday morning among a group of militiamen gathered at a military base south of Baghdad to receive their monthly payment. He said 10 militiamen and three soldiers were killed and 25 others wounded.

The group, known as Sahwa, is made up of Sunni militiamen who joined U.S. troops in the fight against al-Qaida during the height of the insurgency in 2007 and 2008. They are viewed as traitors by the Sunni militants.

A medical official confirmed the casualty figures. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information to the media.
