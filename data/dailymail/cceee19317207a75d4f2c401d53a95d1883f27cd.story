Fun-loving and mischievous: Tyler Whelan was killed after being kicked across a room and into a door, rupturing his abdomen

A 'wicked and controlling' man who murdered his 'fun-loving, mischievous' stepson has today been ordered to serve at least 17 years in prison.

Elvis Lee, 34, was yesterday found guilty of murdering Tyler Whelan, five. Lee admitted he kicked and bit Tyler on the day of his death but denied murder.

The boy's mother, Stephanie Whelan, 27, has been found guilty of failing to prevent his death and is due to be sentenced next month.

The kick was so hard that Tyler flew two feet through the air hitting a door at his home in Paston, near Peterborough, rupturing his abdomen and slowly killing him.

At Cambridge Crown Court today, Mr Justice Nicol sentenced him to life with a minimum tariff of 17 and a half years. He said: 'Tyler had been left in your care while his mother took two other children to school.

'His young life was cut tragically short. This has been a tragedy for his father, his mother and the rest of the family. Tyler was particularly vulnerable because of his age. He was only half your height and a quarter of your weight.

'I entertain the lingering suspicion you inflicted more blows than you have admitted and that may have been the reason Tyler said nothing to his mother when she returned.'

A report published after the conviction found that key opportunities to protect Tyler were missed by authorities tasked with his care.

It acknowledged that previous incidents in which the boy was hurt had been 'seen in isolation' with 'minimal attempts to link concerning patterns of injuries'.

Michael Borrelli QC, mitigating, said Lee’s attack on Tyler on March 7 last year was not pre-meditated and was instead a loss of temper and 'act of spite'.

He
said: 'My client was himself the victim of considerable violence as a 
child. He lacked a real appreciation as to the consequences of what he 
did because, despite the treatment he himself had been the victim of, he
had never suffered serious injury.'

The trial heard evidence that Tyler suffered a number of 'non-accidental' injuries in the year before his death.

But Mr Borrelli said his client had been cleared of cruelty and neglect allegations and should be sentenced on the basis that this was an isolated attack.

In June 2010, a year before he died, Tyler was taken to hospital with a fractured leg.

His mother said he had fallen up some stairs but paediatric registrars referred the case to social services over other bruising to his body.

Children's services said there was no risk and his injuries were from a genuine accident.

In September that year he was in hospital again after falling off a bike. Again social services were told about the incident and again they deemed it to be from a genuine accident.

On February 2011 teachers raised concerns over what they thought to be a radiator burn. Tyler's mother said he was accident prone. He was taken to see a GP but there was no further action.

Head of children's services at Peterborough City Council, councillor Sheila Scott said: 'It was a single violent assault that led to his death and the perpetrator has now been brought to justice.

Malcolm Newsam, Executive Director of Children's Services, said: 'There were certainly missed opportunities when intervention should have been more rigorous.'

A serious case review found it was not possible to say with certainty that Tyler's death was predictable or preventable.

Mr Newsam added: 'Nonetheless the service we offered Tyler was not good enough and we offer our sincere apologies to his extended family for that failing.'

Whelan, who lived in Paston but is originally from Wigan, and Lee, also from Paston, were each cleared of two counts of cruelty or neglect relating to their failure to seek prompt medical attention on previous occasions.

In statement read outside the court on
behalf of Tyler's family yesterday, his father Shaun Harrison said: 'The last year 
of my life has been unbearable. Tyler was a fun-loving mischievous little boy with a big heart and amazing smile.

'I feel lost without him in my life and I can't believe he has gone. It hurts me that I will never get the
chance to see him grow up and see the man he should have become.'

A serious case review, compiled by the Peterborough Safeguarding Children Board and published after the verdict at Cambridge Crown Court, acknowledged failings by the organisations responsible for his care, including Peterborough Children’s Services.

The report concluded that it was impossible to say that, had there been greater intervention, the tragedy would have been prevented.

But the report said: 'Whilst it would 
be very challenging to state with any conviction that the subject’s 
(Tyler’s) death was either predictable or preventable, there were 
certainly numerous missed opportunities when interventions should have 
been more rigorous and incisive on clear occasions when there were 
concerns about his safety at home.

'Additionally, there were some 
occasions when initiatives were not taken to assess the levels of risk 
to the subject when there was a procedural requirement to have done so.

'Even
if any of the missed assessment opportunities had in fact been taken 
and completed in line with procedures, it could still not be said with 
any certainty that they would have made a difference to the eventual 
tragic outcome.'

Superintendent
Simon Megicks, from Cambridgeshire Police, said: 'This was a wicked 
crime in which an innocent five-year-old was murdered by a person who 
should have been looking after him.

'Lee is a controlling and violent man who lost his temper and inflicted fatal injuries to Tyler. Whelan has been found to have allowed his death following these fatal injuries - Tyler deserved more from his mother.

'Every child has the right to be protected and feel safe in their own home and it is a parent’s responsibility to ensure this is the case.'

In a statement, Malcolm Newsam, executive director of children's services at Peterborough City Council, said there were 'lessons to be learned' following Tyler's death.

He added that these were consistent with previous Ofsted inspections which had found weaknesses in the council's procedures to safeguard children.

Sheila Scott, the council's cabinet member for children's services, expressed regret for the 'terrible tragedy'.

DS Simon Megicks described the murder as a 'wicked crime' in which an innocent child was killed by someone who should have been looking after him

She said that since last year the council had recruited an extra 25 social workers, reduced workloads and is now completing assessments of all vulnerable children in a 'timely fashion'.

Mr Newsam said: 'There were certainly missed opportunities when intervention should have been more rigorous. However, sadly, it is not clear that even if we had completed this work to the required standard, that the outcome for Tyler would have been any different.

'Nonetheless, the service we offered Tyler was not good enough and we offer our sincere apologies to his extended family for that failing.

'We would like to reassure residents that Peterborough's children's social care department is unrecognisable now to what it was 12 months ago and we have made significant improvements to our services to vulnerable children.

'We appreciate that our actions since last summer cannot change what has happened in the past, but we can confirm that our services are now much more effective at protecting vulnerable children.'
