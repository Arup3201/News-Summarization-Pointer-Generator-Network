The driveway of a house is usually reserved for a car, a van and often a caravan, but military enthusiast Anthony Cooke knew it would be perfect for another type of vehicle.

He parked his rare monster World War One tank in front of his home, much to the astonishment of his neighbours

Mr Cooke, 57, has been keeping the huge 21ft long army tank on his driveway on a residential estate while he refurbishes it in time for next year's centenary of the start of the Great War.

Tanks a lot: Neighbours were stunned when military enthusiast Anthony Cook parked his World war One Mark IV tank outside his home in Cottenham, Cambridgeshire

The vehicle, which is 13ft wide and weighs six and a half tonnes, is one of just two working replica Mark IV tanks in Europe.

It has taken Anthony, from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, seven months to finish the outside of the tank, which has cost around £40,000 to buy and re-build. He has now started work on the interior.

Mark IV army tanks were first introduced in 
1917 and fought in the Battle of Messines Ridge.

Only 1,220 were ever built -  420 'Males', 595 'Females' and 205 Tank Tenders (unarmed vehicles used to carry supplies).

They cost around £5,000 
to produce and could go at a top speed of 4mph. They remained in official service until the end of the war.

The Mark IV Male carried three Lewis machine guns –  as well as the two sponson guns. The Female had five machine guns.

During the Messines engagement, many of the sixty-plus Mark IVs lagged behind the infantry, but several made important contributions unlike their experience at the third battle of Ypres.

Many of the tanks became immobilised and easy targets for enemy artillery after sinking into swampy ground.

The last M IV to see service was restored to operational status in the early years of World War II and driven from Whale Island, off Portsmouth, to the mainland, where its new career was allegedly brought to an early end after a number of cars were damaged.

He said: 'People do get a shock when they first see the tank in the middle of a residential estate. but  I'm very lucky as my neighbours love it and one little boy even says good night to it each evening.

'It takes up my entire drive and I now have to park my car down the road, but it's worth it as it will look great when it is finished.'

Anthony, who works for a bio tech company, has taken the tank to a number of shows and hopes it will form part of a Great War living history museum he is planning to open in nearby Dry Drayton, Cambs, next year.

'My grandfather was in the Great War and I started to research his past and became besotted with it,' he said.

'Now the last WW1 soldier has died it has passed from memory to history and we need a way to pass on that knowledge.

'I hope the centre will be somewhere school parties can visit to see how soldiers fought and lived on the Western Front.'

The replica tank was originally built for Kenneth Branagh's film The Magic Flute, which was set during World War 1. The only other replica working WW1 tank was built for Steven Spielberg's film War Horse.
