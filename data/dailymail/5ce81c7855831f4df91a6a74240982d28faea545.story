Andrew Marr will return full-time to his presenting duties this autumn after suffering a major stroke

Broadcaster Andrew Marr will return full-time to his presenting duties in the autumn following his recovery from a major stroke, the BBC confirmed today.

The 53-year-old, who spent two months in hospital and has undergone months of physiotherapy to help him walk, takes up the helm again on BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show from September 1 and will also return to Radio 4's Start the Week.

He said: I'm hugely looking forward to coming back and want to give it my all but recovering from a stroke does take time. 

'We've taken the decision to start with the Sunday show in the autumn and I'm delighted to be returning to present Start the Week on Radio 4 later on in the year.'

A Radio 4 spokesman said: 'Andrew is a fantastic presenter and we look forward to having him back on Radio 4. 

'Meanwhile Start the Week will continue to be presented by Stephanie Flanders and a few other regulars.'

The broadcaster fell ill at his home in East Sheen, south west London at the start of the year.

Colleagues were left stunned and concerned when the BBC revealed Mr Marr's illness.

He is married to journalist Jackie Ashley and has three children.

Guest presenters have stepped in to cover his duties since the stroke.

Marr, the corporation's former political editor, began his career as a newspaper reporter, becoming the editor of The Independent before turning to television.

He has also presented a number of history programmes along with his politics show and has had five books published.

He is known for his hard hitting interviews of politicians and public figures.

Official statistics show that strokes are the third biggest cause of death — and somebody suffers one in Britain every five minutes.

A stroke is brain damage caused by a blocked blood vessel or bleeding in the brain and can occur at any age but is most common in over-65s (the risk approximately doubles for each decade of life after age 55).

Luckily, the stroke hit the left side of Marr's brain — which means his memory and speech are not impaired.

In all, there are around 1.2 million stroke survivors in the UK — more than half being left with disabilities that affect their daily life.
