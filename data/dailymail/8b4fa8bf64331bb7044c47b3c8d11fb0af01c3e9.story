It’s usually a case of rags to riches on Britain’s Got Talent. This year it could be more a case of riches to riches.

Lettice Rowbotham, one of the first acts to be tipped for stardom by the judges, is not only extremely wealthy, but her mother is a renowned painter whose work is collected by the Royal Family.

Sherree Valentine Daines’s impressionist paintings can sell for up to £10,000 a piece, and have been shown at the Tate and the Barbican in London.

She has painted both Michael Parkinson and Joanna Lumley, and counts Jeffrey Archer among her fans and collectors.

Her success no doubt helped fund Miss Rowbotham, 24, through several public schools, including the £30,000-a-year Purcell School of Music in Bushey, Hertfordshire, and Charterhouse in Godalming, Surrey, where day fees are more than £20,000.

In fact Miss Rowbotham’s background is so posh producers of Channel 4’s Made In Chelsea, a reality show following heirs and socialites living in west London, approached her for a starring role, which she turned down to concentrate on her electric violin.

Miss Rowbotham currently lives at her parents’ £3million 18th century six-bedroom mansion, which boasts a glass spiral staircase and music room, in a village outside Dorking in Surrey.

Referring to judge David Walliams’s comment that she was the ‘poshest’ contestant to audition, she said: ‘I’ve never really considered myself posh, it’s mainly about talent.’

Miss Rowbotham said she was encouraged to audition by her younger sisters Bunty, 19, and Felicity, 16. She said: ‘It was so much fun. I do like to party and going to pubs so I was a little hungover at the audition. I want to be as big as Beyonce, have my own tour and merchandise.’

But the keen skier and windsurfer, who practises up to six hours a day, admitted she has no plans to tone down her extravagant lifestyle. Indeed, she was still in bed at 3pm yesterday after a late night out.

‘There are plenty of people around me who will probably encourage me to have a few more early  nights,’ she said. ‘But I’ve always been a party animal and I’ve got plenty of energy.’

After her performance on her electric violin to three modern chart tracks, the BGT judges were quick to compliment her. Simon Cowell said: ‘Lettice, not only are you brilliant, you have a fantastic personality as well, you are one of the people I am going to remember coming away from this.’

Miss Rowbotham’s mother’s website states: ‘It is almost impossible to overstate the influence and contribution of Sherree Valentine Daines to the contemporary art scene in this country.

‘Her unquestionable virtuosity has made her a favourite with many celebrity collectors including members of the British Royal Family and she has been the portrait artist of choice for the great and good of public life.' 

A look at her CV would show that Lettice Rowbotham is hardly undiscovered talent.

Even before she auditioned for BGT the violinist performed for thousands alongside pop stars Olly Murs and Kelis, and even for Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace.

The Royal College of Music graduate, who is good friends with former X Factor winner Matt Cardle, is no stranger to high profile concerts.

According to her Facebook page, she has played for the late Sir David Frost at Arundel Castle, West Sussex, as well as at London’s Royal Albert Hall. She has even told how she performed for Russian president Vladimir Putin at his daughter’s hush-hush wedding in Morocco in 2012.

In 2011, the violinist appeared on a BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge session with former X Factor winner Murs, who is signed to Simon Cowell’s record label, Syco.

Miss Rowbotham, who used to be part of a female group called High On Heels, has also toured America with two other musicians.

Yesterday she said: ‘Performing with Olly was an amazing experience. He is a lot of fun and is always very upbeat and bouncy.’

She is not the first act to have already appeared in front of huge crowds before entering Britain’s Got Talent. Last week, Paddy Jones and her dance partner Nico Espinosa got to the semi-finals despite winning a Spanish version of the programme.

A secret email also revealed the show’s executives sent out requests to top talent agencies looking for experienced acts.
