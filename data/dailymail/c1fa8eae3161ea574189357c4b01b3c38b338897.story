'Lara is a stunning bride! I couldn't be happier to share this special weekend with her and Eric,' Ivanka, 33, told People of her sister-in-law.

Ivanka's adorable three-year-old daughter Arabella served as a flower girl in the ceremony, while the groom's brother Donald Trump Jr. was the best man.

The family affair was held at the same location where Donald Trump and his wife Melania married in 2005.

Mr Trump is both the founder of The Eric Trump Foundation and Executive Vice President of Development and Acquisitions for the Trump Organization. The couple currently reside in New York City and Westchester.
