A Mexican police officer who went on a brutal endangered wildlife hunting spree using a gun provided by his employer has been forced to resign.

Sickening images of Wilfer Geovany Contreras Rosado, 38, posing in his police uniform with the bloodied corpses of rare deer, falcons and crocodiles went viral after being posted online last week.

Rosado, who lives and works in the southern Mexican state of Campeche, had reportedly boasted to friends about the number of endangered animals he had slaughtered during his hunting trip.

Rosado was forced to resign from the Campeche police force after images of his hunting trip were posted on Facebook.

Police 
chiefs claim that as he no longer works as a
 police officer, the matter has been dealt with.

However
 critics including environmental activists say that the police force has
 to take responsibility for the fact that he used his police weapon and 
ammunition to kill the animals.

The images that were shared online showed a dead white tailed deer, several Morelet's crocodiles and a bird of prey.

All of the animals Rosado is believed to have killed are not allowed to be hunted under Mexican law.

Butchered: Although the force Rosado worked for are refusing to investigate his hunting spree - which claimed the life of this rare crocodile - the environmental police have now opened a case against him

The Mexican Federal Attorney for 
Environmental Protection (Profepa) has confirmed that an investigation 
is undergoing on charges of violating the Federal Law on Environmental 
Protectio.

It said the case was being built solely around the images posted on social media, all of which have now been deleted from the original source.

Victor Perez Aguilar, the deputy director of the state police in the area where the officer worked, said that the fact Rosado had resigned meant that they would not be investigating the matter themselves.

'He resigned voluntary from the police 
force, but this does not mean the officer does not escape responsibility
 and he will have to face the consequences of the investigation by the 
environmental protection office,' he said.

The Profeoa investigation is likely to continue for several days before any formal charges are made.
