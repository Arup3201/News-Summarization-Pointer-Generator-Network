Battle: Roy Pugh, 80, is in a dispute with council officers over a ramp he wants outside his house

A disabled war veteran has been  housebound since January as he fights a  battle with council chiefs to install a ramp outside his bungalow.

Roy Pugh, 80,  was left struggling to walk down his outdoor steps after a heart attack and stroke - but was repeatedly turned down for the ramp because he was using a walking frame.

That meant a mobility scooter which friends from the Royal British Legion had bought him lay unused in a garage, because there was no way to get it down the stairs.

It is now ten months since he last made it unaided  to the town centre in Ripley, Derbyshire, just a few hundred yards away.

Mr Pugh, who served with the Army in North Korea for six years and as a reservist for nine years, claimed he was marooned by council bureaucracy.

He kept pushing Derbyshire County Council, who he first contacted in February, and was eventually  able to lodge a formal application to fund the ramp in July.

He had to sit on a four-month waiting list before he was finally seen last week.

His bid was approved - though the funds are not yet  confirmed, and he claims he was told in the latest visit this week: 'Don't hold your breath for another eight months'.

Mr Pugh said: 'I haven't been into Ripley town since January. I'm on my own and I can't get the scooter in or out. 

'I'm getting a bit fed up to be honest. It takes me about an hour to walk half the length of a football pitch and I need to rest every so often due to medical conditions.

'When I asked social services how I was expected to get out of the house to do my shopping I was told to get a taxi. I then asked them what I'd do once I got into town and they said I should just find a seat.

'I just want to put my coat on and go out for a bottle of milk, or some crisps, or a newspaper. I would like to do it myself.'

Dean Fowler, chairman of the Ripley branch of the Royal British Legion, said Mr Pugh had been in contact with Derbyshire County Council since the start of the year.

Members clubbed together and gave the veteran a mobility scooter in February, but it has languished in another member's garage because there was no way to use it.

But a council spokesman insisted officials did not know the mobility scooter existed until last week, when it was moved for storage inside Mr Pugh's house.

Mr Pugh could make it to the top of these steps but no further - and has not been out alone for months

Royal British Legion branch chairman Dean Fowler said: 'When Roy's been phoning these departments he's been bounced from one to another and no one's given him a clear and concise decision'

Mr Fowler said: 'Roy's a very proud man and despite being able to get around his home he just doesn't have the strength to get down the steps either side of his house and into town to do the things we take for granted... It's disgusting.

'When Roy's been phoning these departments he's been bounced from one to another and no one's given him a clear and concise decision. 

'Roy receives help from carers and his family but it's just not the same as being able to do things for yourself.' 

A Derbyshire County Council spokesman said Mr Pugh first asked for a ramp on February 25, but was declined because he was using a walking frame, which a ramp can make more dangerous.

He was seen again in April and given a wheelchair in which friends could push him around, but again, 'a ramp was not thought to be appropriate'.

A social worker then visited him on May 25, but his request was declined for a third time.

The spokesman added: 'In July he was put forward for assessment. Due to a lengthy waiting list, he was assessed on November 11 and it was agreed that, subject to the outcome of a visit this week, we would recommend a ramp be provided.' 

The spokesman insisted officers had no knowledge of the mobility scooter until last week. 

The final stages are being considered by Amber Valley Borough Council. 

Housing manager David Arkle said: 'When Amber Valley Borough Council receives the formal assessment we will ensure that a means test is completed to ensure financial eligibility.

'It is important that every case is treated on its merits and the specific needs of the applicant are taken into account.'

Nigel Mills, conservative MP for Amber Valley said: 'It is disappointing that Mr Pugh has been let down by Derbyshire County Council's Social Services. 

'It is unacceptable that a war veteran has lost his independence as he tries to recover.

'I hope that the ramp can finally be installed soon and Mr Pugh can then use the scooter the British Legion have provided him with - a further example of the great work they do for our veterans.'
