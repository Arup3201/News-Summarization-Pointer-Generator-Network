A father who posted a picture of him with his baby daughter and a chilling message on Facebook before shooting her in the head has died, it emerged today.

Merrick McKoy, from Colorado, had broken into his ex-girlfriend's Westminster apartment on November 18 and, after she fled to raise the alarm, he killed their 19-month-old daughter Mia before turning the gun on himself.

When police arrived, he was still alive and transported to a nearby hospital.

The coroner said an autopsy will be conducted to determine McKoy's cause and manner of death.

Citing the ongoing investigation, a coroner's official would not release the specific date McKoy died, ABC's The Denver Channel reports.

Mia's mother, Kim Phanthavongsa, had a restraining order against McKoy who was described as being abusive and jealous.

She told police that she woke on Monday 18th to find the 22-year-old standing over her with a gun. After a fight she managed to run to a neighbor's to call police.

After she left the apartment, McKoy posted pictures of himself with Mia, who had just learned to walk, and a series of chilling messages on to his Facebook page.

In one post he said: 'I told u I can’t live without u lol u thought I was joking now me n Mia out this b****.'

The last post on his Facebook page, under the name Type R Merrick (f** Kim), read: 'Don’t judge me had no choice.'

In a frantic 911 call, police were told McKoy was in the apartment with Mia and a gun. As police rushed to the apartment McKoy shot Mia in the head and turned the gun on himself.

McKoy had been the subject of a restraining order after a domestic violence incident involving 21-year-old Miss Phanthavongsa. He had been charged with assault, burglary, trespassing and harassment.

The family of Miss Phanthavongsa, a nursing assistant student, described him as possessive and jealous.

'He was the type to say, if you’re not 
with me, you can’t be with anybody else,' Smaly Chham, told 9 News.

A neighbor added: 'He would just say that he wanted to be with her and if he can't be with her, nobody can be with her.'

Mia was remembered by her aunt, Vannatda Sivixai as a happy child who was just beginning to walk.

'What an angel. Whenever she smiled it was bright,' Miss Sivixai said.
