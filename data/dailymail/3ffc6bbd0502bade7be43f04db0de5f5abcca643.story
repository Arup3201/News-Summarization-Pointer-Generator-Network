It is the only the type of family drama that Kris Jenner wouldn't want broadcasted on Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

On Friday morning, Khloe's husband Lamar Odom was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in the early hours of Friday morning.

The NBA star, 33, was held at Van Nuys police station on $15,000 bail but was released from custody at 8.30am.

He was pulled over just before 4am for driving too slow at 50mph on the 101 Freeway in the San Fernando Valley.

Booking sheet: The NBA star is understood to have failed several sobriety tests

Odom did not immediately respond to police, passing three exits and driving erratically, TMZ reports.

He failed numerous field sobriety checks but refused all chemical tests, according to police.

eland Tang, the California Highway Patrol public information officer, told Radar Online: 'Lamar Odom was driving 50 mph on the 101 freeway. He was driving in a serpentine manner which is pretty bad. That is like when the officer does a freeway break. Across all the lanes of the freeway. I’m surprised he wasn’t rear ended.'

After 'failing' field sobriety tests, he was taken into custody and Tang said: 'He did what no one should ever do, he refused the chemical tests.

'That means that his license is 
revoked and Lamar could get the most powerful attorney in the world and 
he is still not going to have a license for a year.'

To make matters worse, it has now been revealed that Lamar was paid a visit by two drug councelors just hours before he was charged with a DUI.

TMZ reports that the counselors - who work with the National Basketball Players Association - contacted Lamar to offer help and he accepted.

During the visit to Lamar and Khloe's house, TMZ report that he was very receptive with a source telling them 'it was very positive'.

However, after the pair left, Lamar then got into his vehicle and never came home.

It follows weeks of troubling allegations about drug abuse and serious marriage issues with his wife of four years.

Reports claim he has been battling an addiction to 'Oxycontin and crack cocaine' for two years.

He has also been accused of cheating with two different women while on the road as a basketball player.

Loyal wife Khloe, who was pictured 
looking downcast as she arrived at a LA gym on Thursday, is apparently 
desperate to 'save' her husband from his alleged drug problems and work 
through their marital woes.

Something the matter? It's virtually unheard of for Kris Jenner to keep a low profile, but it seems Lamar's troubles may be playing on the momager's mind as she was seen arriving in Burbank on Thursday

A source has said: 'She is in love and does not want a divorce.'

Both have been pictured with their wedding rings on separate outings this week.

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star reportedly staged an 
intervention earlier this month, but the meeting didn't go as planned and Lamar vanished, 
but was later tracked down to a hotel in Los Angeles.

He returned to his L.A. home on Monday after staying away for several days.

Khloe
apparently kept the details of her marital problems a secret from most 
members of family, and insiders say they were 'shocked' to learn of the 
extent of the issues. (Sources tell Radar Khloe's brother Rob, who lives with the couple, has been aware of Lamar's alleged drug problems for over a year.)

The 6-foot-10-inch forward has played for the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers, the Miami Heat and Dallas Mavericks.

He broke into the NBA with the Clippers in 1999, playing for them for four seasons before spending the 2003-04 season with the Heat.

He had his best years during his six seasons with the Lakers, beginning in 2004-05. The team won NBA championships in 2010 and 2011 and Odom won the NBA's sixth man award in 2011.

After spending the 2012 season with the Dallas Mavericks, he returned to the Clippers last year. He became a free agent at the end of the season.

His once glittering career now appears to be in tatters.

'Players are starting to return to their teams, and Lamar doesn't have a 
team,' an NBA insider told People earlier this week. 'He's gone from making $8.5 
million last year to being out of work at this point.'

'There's an old saying in the NBA: 
Are you more valuable than your problems? And it's just reached the 
point with Lamar where he is not more valuable than his problems,' the 
insider said

'Up until about two years ago, Lamar 
Odom was averaging about 15 points and eight rebounds a game and you 
know what? You deal with his off-court problems for that. When Lamar 
Odom averages four points a game, he's not worth the problems.'

However the source added that Lamar 
could still be in with a spot on the Los Angeles Lakers, although he 
would probably have to take a significant pay cut.
