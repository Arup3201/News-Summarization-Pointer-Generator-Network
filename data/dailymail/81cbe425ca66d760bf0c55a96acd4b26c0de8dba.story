The family of a British schoolgirl who died at a doctors’ clinic in India fear she could have been ‘murdered’ by medics intent on harvesting her organs.

Gurkiren Kaur Loyal’s parents took her to see doctors in the Punjab when she began suffering from dehydration 11 days into her first foreign holiday.

Her father, Santokh Ghatoara, and mother, Amritpal Kaur Loyal, claim that their eight-year-old daughter was ‘fine’ until she was given a mystery injection.

This is the last picture of Gurkiren Kaur Loyal, front, with her parents and brother before she died in India last month aged eight in what her parents believe was a failed attempt to illegally harvest her organs

Gurkiren was described as a 'bright and bubbly' pupil at her primary school in Handsworth, Birmingham

Yesterday they told how, within 
seconds of receiving the jab, Gurkiren’s ‘eyes rolled back into her head
and her face drained of colour’ before she collapsed and died. ‘I knew 
they had killed her on the spot,’ said her mother.

Mr Ghatoara, a 57-year-old postal 
worker, and his wife were so fearful that their daughter’s organs could 
be taken and sold on for transplant that they insisted on taking her 
body back to a relative’s home.

The body was kept for four days in a 
freezer borrowed from a local Sikh temple before it was taken to a local
hospital. There, a ‘medieval’ post-mortem examination was carried out.

Gurkiren’s parents had been told they 
would not be allowed to fly their child home without one. During the 
post-mortem, Gurkira’s organs were removed and have not been returned.

The Birmingham coroner, Aidan Cotter, 
has told the family that without them, or the Indian post-mortem report,
he is at a loss to determine a cause of death.

A spokesman said staff were making inquiries into the whereabouts of Gurkiren’s missing organs.

Gurkiren had gone to a clinic in Punjab seeking treatment for simply dehydration when she died suddenly

Her parents had taken her to the Moudgill clinic in Khanna, Punjab, after she began vomiting and complaining of stomach pains.

She was diagnosed with dehydration and
placed on a drip, but after 30 minutes the doctor appeared with the 
syringe. After collapsing, Gurkiren was taken to Khanna Nursing Home 
hospital ten minutes away, where she was pronounced dead.

Miss Loyal, a supermarket worker from 
Hockley in Birmingham, said: ‘We were just talking to Gurkiren when a 
doctor’s assistant came up carrying a pre-filled syringe and reached for
the cannula in her hand.

‘I asked what was the injection for, 
but he just looked at me blankly and injected her. Within a split-second
Gurkiren’s head flipped back, her eyes rolled in her head, and the 
colour completely drained from her. I knew they had killed her on the 
spot.’

The schoolgirl had been on holiday with her parents and her 17-year-old brother, Simran, when she died

Gurkiren's mother said after her daughter was given a mystery injection, 'her eyes rolled in her head'

She added: ‘We have read about a trade
in organs in India and we fear the doctors may have been after 
Gurkiren’s organs. That’s why we would not leave her body unattended 
after she had died.’

The trade in human organs has long 
blighted Indian society. Despite being outlawed since 1994, there 
remains a flourishing black market – with as many as 2,000 human kidneys
sold each year. Wealthy foreigners have driven the demand, with many 
poor or illiterate Indians willing to donate in return for payments 
equivalent to a year’s salary.

The family say Dr Pardeep Moudgill, who ran the clinic, disappeared following the tragedy and did not return messages.

Gurkiren’s parents said Indian police 
seemed uninterested in investigating. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 
‘We can confirm the death of a British national in Punjab on April 2, 
2013.’

Last night, Dr Moudgill and the 
Rajendra Hospital in Patiala, where the post-mortem examination was 
carried out, were unavailable for comment.
