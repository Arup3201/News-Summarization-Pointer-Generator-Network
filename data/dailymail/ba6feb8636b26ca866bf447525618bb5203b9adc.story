While Apple prefers to remain tight-lipped about upcoming product launches, Samsung’s executive vice president is much more open.

Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas, Lee Young Hee announced that the firm is looking to release its next flagship phone between March and April - and it will be called the Galaxy S5.

Lee also discussed the possibility a future model of the phone could feature iris recognition technology, yet did not confirm if it would be added to S5 or not.

Rumours have suggested Samsung is working on a follow-up to its Galaxy Gear smartwatch since last year, too, and this could be unveiled at the same time as the S5.

Lee told Bloomberg: We’ve been announcing our first flagship model in the first half of each year, around March and April, and we are still targeting for release around that time.

‘When we release our S5 device, you can also expect a Gear successor with more advanced functions, and the bulky design will also be improved.’

Lee is referring to the criticism the watch received when it went on sale in September last year.

Biometric experts at New York-based firm EyeLock have created a dongle fitted with an iris scanner.

The Myris device can register up to five different users.

Each user begins by scanning their eyes to take an image of their respective irises. These unique images are then translated into an encrypted code. 

The scan takes between 10 and 20 seconds and the authentication code is created immediately.

Once registered, each user can add various online passwords to their Myris profile.

Next time the user visits one of these accounts, instead of entering a password, they can scan their eyes for immediate and secure access.

According to EyeLock, the False Acceptance Rate of the average fingerprint sensor, in which the system is hacked by an unknown print, is one in every 10,000 scans.  For iris scans, this increases to one 1 in 2.25 trillion scans.

Myris is set to go on sale before the summer and will cost around $250 (£150) although an exact date and price is yet to be announced.

Some analysts claimed the Korean firm had rushed the production of the gadget in order to beat Apple to releasing a smartwatch, and the design suffered.

However, Apple has still not announced its rumoured iWatch.

Regarding the iris recognition technology, Lee said during Samsung’s press event at the Consumer Electronics Show: ‘Many people are fanatical about iris recognition technology and we are studying the possibility but can’t really say whether we will have it or not on the S5.’

Samsung is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on Apple’s iPhone 5S.

Iris scanning is more secure than fingerprint scanning, and the technology involved is cheaper, making it a more obvious choice to add to future models.

Iris scanning involves a simple charge-coupled device digital camera that uses visible and near-infrared light to take a clear, high-contrast image of a person’s iris.

When the camera takes the image, a scanner plots the centre of the pupil, edge of the pupil, edge of the iris, eyelids and eyelashes.

It then analyses the unique patterns in the iris and translates this pattern into a code.

Next time the eye is scanned, this code is compared to the pattern to authenticate a match.

The iris scanner would not be the first time Samsung has introduced eye-tracking technology.

Its Galaxy S4 includes a feature that locks onto the movement and position of a user’s eyes.

The phone can analyse where the user is looking and will automatically scroll a web page when the eyes reach the bottom of the screen, for example, or lock the screen when the user looks away.

Both of Samsung's new devices are expected to be unveiled during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. They will likely then go on sale in Korea in March, before being rolled out worldwide in April.
