Kings Palace literally leapt his way to the head of the betting for the RSA Chase at Cheltenham on Friday.

Coral make the son of King’s Theatre 7-1 for the Festival prize as trainer David Pipe conceded he has probably never had a better jumper of a fence in his stable.

Kings Palace was a last hurdle faller in the Albert Bartlett Hurdle at last season’s Festival but his athleticism was evident as the Evens favourite made all in the Ryman Stationary Novices’ Chase and pulled seven lengths clear of Sausalito Sunrise under Tom Scudamore.

The winning margin was almost double the distance that separated the pair at last month’s Open meeting with Kings Palace re-opposing on 8lb worse terms.

Pipe said: ‘Every jockey and trainer wants a horses with his potential. Jumping seems so much easier for him and it puts the others under pressure. The second is a good horse, the type which keeps coming back for more. He nearly came upsides us but Scu was always confident.’

Scudamore added: ‘We were really trapping over the last few fences. He is quick, neat and really exciting.’

The Festival, specifically the Neptune Investment Novices’ Hurdle, is also the target for Warren Greatrex-trained Seedling after he reeled in long-time leader Some Plan to win the British Stallion Studs Novices’ Hurdle by a length and a half under Gavin Sheehan.

Greatrex said: ‘Gavin has given him a peach of a ride. Better ground suits him and we will look at the Neptune and work back.’

Local trainer Martin Keighley had been enduring a frustrating spell but bounced back to form as Benbane Head (Conor Shoemark) won the Majordomo Hospitality Handicap Chase and Any Currency (Aidan Coleman) the Glenfarclas Cross Country Chase, a contest marred by the death of Big Shu, winner of the Cross Country race the 2013 Festival.

Philip Hobbs says Captain Chris, third in the 2011 King George VI Chase and second in the 2012 race, will miss this year’s renewal on Boxing Day because of a leg injury. He had been a 14-1 shot with sponsors William Hill.
