Kevin Ward Jr. died of blunt force trauma when he was hit by a car driven by NASCAR star Tony Stewart, his autopsy has revealed.

The autopsy was completed on Monday, two days after the 20-year-old New York sprint car driver died after the incident in Canandaigua, New York, Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero said.

Authorities questioned Stewart following the tragedy on Saturday and went to Watkins Glen to talk to him again on Sunday - but Povero said there were no plans 'at this time' to speak with him again.

Ward's funeral will be held on Thursday, according to the Empire Super Sprints website.

Povero reiterated that there is no evidence that a crime was committed, and said authorities had a second video of the fatal incident that they were reviewing.

The second video shows the incident from a different angle, he said. There was no camera in Stewart's car that could have recorded the crash.

Other footage of the incident shows Stewart's car struck Ward as the young driver stood on the dirt track after he hit a wall.

The crash occurred on lap 14 of a 25-lap race at the Canandaigua Motorsports Park in upstate New York on Saturday evening.

 then seen getting out of the car and approaching Stewart on foot as he 
comes around for another turn

Tragic end: But just seconds later, Stewart's car hits Ward Jr and sends the 20-year-old flying

A video of the incident shows Stewart's car apparently making contact with Ward's car before the younger driver's vehicle spins out and comes to a stop near a wall, CNN reported.

Ward can then be seen getting out of his crashed car and walking towards other cars on the track before pointing a finger, apparently at Stewart.

A car swerves to avoid him, but when Stewart's car passes close to Ward, his right rear tire apparently hits him, and Ward was pulled beneath the car and thrown in the air.

In the 
next scene emergency workers are seen rushing to his aid. Ward Jr was 
apparently not struck at racing speed, but sprint cars can go as fast at
 140 mph.

The
 track canceled the remainder of the Empire Super Sprints slate within 
five minutes.

Speaking out: On Monday, fellow driver Paul Kinney (pictured with his girlfriend) said he could clearly see Kevin Ward JR on the track before the tragedy, and that only Stewart knows what happened

Ontario
 County Sheriff Philip Povero said Stewart was 'visibly shaken' and had 
been cooperative in the investigation. Authorities were asking 
spectators and others to turn over any video they have.

'This
 is right now being investigated as an on-track crash and I don't want 
to infer that there are criminal charges pending,' Povero said.

'When 
the investigation is completed, we will sit down with the district 
attorney and review it. But I want to make it very clear: there are no 
criminal charges pending at this time.'

On Monday, a NASCAR 
driver who competed in the night race said Ward could clearly be seen on the track 
before Tony Stewart ran him over.

Dirt
 track racer Paul Kinney said while he didn't witness the shocking crash, he drove past Ward moments before he was hit 
by Stewart.

'I drove right by him,' Kinney told NBC News on Monday.

'Itâ€™s not a good idea to get out of your 
car and run towards other cars. But nobody can speak for Tony. Only Tony
 knows exactly what happened. I seen Kevin clear as day. Nobody else ran
 into him, either.'

After the tragedy, Stewart dropped out of Sunday's NASCAR event at Watkins Glen, New York.

'There aren't words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr.,' Stewart said in a statement on Sunday. 'It's a very emotional time for all involved... My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this tragedy.'

According 
to his website Kevin Ward Jr has been racing since age four when he 
first started go-karting. He started Sprint Car racing in 2011. The 
20-year-old from Port Leyden, New York, was Empire Super Sprint rookie 
of the year in 2012 and this year was his fifth season racing the Empire
 Super Sprints.
