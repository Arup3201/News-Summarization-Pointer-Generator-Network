Stan Collymore has today been called a 'vile hypocrite' by his former girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson for complaining to police about Twitter trolls.

The former England and Liverpool striker punched and kicked the 46-year-old Swedish TV presenter in the head 15 years ago during a brutal attack in a Paris bar.

This morning Mr Collymore, 42, now a radio pundit, quit Twitter after he started a campaign against online abuse having received a barrage of death threats and racist taunts himself.

'If he's so against death threats, why did he say he'd 'f****** kill' me? It's a disgrace,' Ms Jonsson told The Sun.

Row: Ulrika Jonsson has called her ex Stan Collymore a 'vile hypocrite' for complaining about abuse when he beat her up in 1998

Attack: Ulrika says Stan was a 'malicious bully' when they were together, and she was punched and kicked in the head by him before he sliced up her clothes

The then couple had been together 18 months when Collymore said he was taunted by hundreds of Scottish fans as he went into a bar during the 1998 World Cup in France.

When
 he got in, he saw Ulrika wearing a Scotland shirt, pulling pints behind
 the bar and warned her anyone could jump over the bar at her.

After flying into a rage he dragged her to floor and kicked her three times in the head before he was dragged away.

Ms Jonsson said the 'malicious bully' then went back to their hotel room and sliced up her clothes and belongings.

'Now he's the poster boy against threats online. It's beyond ironic,' she said today.

'Everyone deserves a second chance but I've lost count of the chances Stan has had. He was a textbook abuser'.

Responding today Mr Collymore said: 'There are people using a 15-year-old story to say well actually you did this now in 2014, not 1998, you do not deserve to speak out out about someone writing 'I'm going to turn up to your house and murder you".

'When I'm trying to talk about safeguards for everybody and live within the laws is to protect people, not me'.

'A 15-year-old story is in the past. It bears no relevance to me today'.

Accusations: Ms Jonsson, who broke up with the footballer on the day after the attack, said today: 'I've lost count of the chances Stan has had. He was a textbook abuser'

Collymore's
 potentially glittering career was always dogged by reports of him being
 thrown out of bars, being banned from games and his attack on Ulrika.

He was once caught dogging - but he has never been 
implicated in a crime.

Speaking about the attack on his ex he said: 'I
 felt a mixture of jealousy and betrayal - lots of negative emotions 
rushed into my head and suddenly I hit her in the face...I apologised to
 her, of course, privately, then publicly afterwards, although we split 
up back in London the next day'.

Twitter reaction: Stan Collymore turned on Ulrika Jonsson last night and called her 'absolutely desperate'

Yesterday he said Twitter did not go far enough to help police identify the culprits and protect him from abuse.

The
 former striker said officers were ‘banging their heads against the 
wall’ because Twitter was dragging its feet over revealing the trolls’ 
identities.

He was 
abused online after suggesting that Liverpool striker Luis Suarez 
cheated by diving during last Saturday’s match against Aston Villa.

He tweeted: ‘In the last 24 hours I’ve 
been threatened with murder several times, demeaned on my race, and many
 of these accounts are still active. Why? I accuse Twitter directly of 
not doing enough to combat racist/homophobic/sexist hate messages, all 
of which are illegal in the UK.’

Call to action: Mr Collymore has received dozens of messages of support from his followers but he has now quit the social network

Abuse: Police have launched an investigation over this message, which Mr Collymore retweeted to his followers

Twitter said targeted abuse was against its rules and there were ‘established processes’ to help police in such cases.

Yesterday when challenged about his past Mr Collymore said: 'Regardless of what the perception of me as a character is, I 
have the right to be able to walk down the road, and if someone calls me
 the N-word to be able to report it and get it to dealt with. I would 
expect that I should be accorded the same courtesy on Twitter.’

But Twitter users, including one called Katrina, said: '@stancollymore Don't expect sympathy for verbal abuse when you were quite happy to deal out physical abuse to Ulrika!'

Ms Jonsson spoke out today in an interview with The Sun's Dulcie Pearce.
