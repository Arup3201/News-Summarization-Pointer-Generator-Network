When it comes to the NFL, the show must go on... unless of course, there's a major snowstorm.

The NFL has said that it there is a possibility that Super Bowl XLVIII could be played on an alternative day to February 2nd should bad weather be scheduled to hit the area on game day.

However, any decision to play the Super Bowl on a day other than Superbowl Sunday would have to be made 36 hours in advance.

The show must go on:  Some snow or showers could be in the forecast for Super Sunday, February 2nd

Chilly outlook: MetLife Stadium, which will host Superbowl XLVIII next month is being called the first ever 'cold weather superbowl,' the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks will face off in front of over 80,000 fans on February 2

Shiver supporters: Cold weather welcome kits have been produced for fans that will include earmuffs, hats, mittens, hand warmers, lip balm, and tissues, among other items

NFL Executive Vice President Eric Grubman has said a time frame has been worked out if bad weather forces a change in the Super Bowl schedule.

Denver and Seattle are scheduled to kick off the Super Bowl in East Rutherford, New Jersey, at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday, February 2nd.

Long-range forecasts call for the possibility of snow on that date, but the NFL has decided the game could be played on any day from Friday, January 31st to Monday, February 3rd - or it could be moved back even further.

If there is an unexpected storm that brings the metropolitan area to a halt, then the league has contingency plans to reschedule the game for a different date.

'We would need 24 hours to move the game time,' Mr Grubman said. 'We need 36 hours to move the day.'

A snowstorm that hit the region this week gave crews a chance to clear the stadium, concourses and parking lots in a 'dress rehearsal.'

It took 18 hours for a complete cleanup of snow from the stadium area.

'Crews at the stadium will be ready to move snow in the parking lots, seating areas and on the field and on our vitally important roadways,'' said Al Kelly, chairman of the Super Bowl Host Committee.

'We will be prepared to move snow quickly. These efforts will enable hundreds of thousands of visitors to move more easily through the region, whether they're going to the Super Bowl, another event, or Met-Life Stadium. The reality is that many of us in the New York and New Jersey area are accustomed to it. A snowstorm can hit at any time, but that doesn't mean people should not be able to move around or football not be able to be played. The key is to be prepared and have the resources in place and be able to clear the snow efficiently.'

'We want to make sure that the national audience know that this region has tremendous assets and resources to get this done,'' Supovitz said.

'It's nothing more than reassuring people that despite the fact that the world's greatest event is going to be here, we still know how to clear snow. We keep the markets open every day and schools open most days. We'll do a good job Super Bowl week as well.''
