Heartbreak: Tracey Maloney, 47, has spoken out about the late-night confession that brought to a close her marriage to former boxing promoter Frank Maloney

Tracey and Frank Maloney before they separated. The marriage had been in trouble for years, with Maloney struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts, before it all came to a head in October 2009

Retired boxing manager Kellie Maloney (formerly known as Frank Maloney) looks on before a title fight in Erfurt, Germany. His ex-wife Tracey has spoken of the traumatic night he revealed to her his secret

Last week, her 61-year-old ex-husband
 – who guided Lennox Lewis to the world  heavyweight title – revealed he
 is undergoing a sex change.

In
 an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Mrs Maloney has spoken of the late
 night confession that brought to a close their 20-year relationship.

The marriage had been in trouble for years, with Mr Maloney struggling 
with depression and vanishing for weeks at a time, she said.

It later 
emerged he had been going to a secret flat by the coast, stocked with 
female clothing. 

It all came 
to a head in October 2009 when Maloney called her down to the kitchen at
 4am after a blistering row the night before and tearfully admitted: 
‘I’m a woman.’

She said he was
 ‘visibly tortured’ and kept telling her he wanted to kill himself. 

The 61-year-old says she is amazed by the positive reaction of both the public and the boxing community

‘I 
was utterly devastated,’ she added. ‘I knew at that moment that he had 
opened the lid on a box that could never ever be closed again.’

Maloney
 tried to persuade her to keep the marriage going – but she said ‘in 
that split second everything changed for ever’.

She also spoke of the 
effect on their two daughters.

‘He is a brilliant father but it’s been 
devastating for them. He was their hero,’ she said.

The couple tried in 
vain to rekindle the relationship until Maloney finally moved out of the
 family home in Kent in 2012.

At
 Christmas that year, she said emotions were running high and he made a 
desperate suicide attempt.

Mrs Maloney revealed: ‘We were all really 
distraught and the girls and I wouldn’t go back into the house until he 
left. My daughter said to me, “you’re doing this to him”. I would rather
 she thought that than know the truth. I never wanted the children to 
know the truth.’

Soon afterwards, Maloney started divorce proceedings. ‘I wouldn’t have married him if I’d known he was a woman,’ she said.

However, the pair remain friends – although she cannot bring herself to call him by the name Kellie.
