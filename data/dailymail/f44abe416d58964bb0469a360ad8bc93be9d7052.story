Promising: Anne Smedingoff, 25, was working to create opportunities for women in Afghanistan

A promising young diplomat from Chicago has been killed in a suicide bombing along with five other Americans in the deadliest day in the war in eight months.

Anne Smedingoff, 25, is the first member of the Foreign Service killed in the 12-year-old War in Afghanistan. She is also the first American  diplomat to die overseas since the consulate attacks in Benghazi, Libya, claimed the lives of Ambassador Chris Stevens and Sean Smith.

She had been working with schools and businesses to improve the lives of girls and women in the southern province of Zabul.

'It was a great adventure for her ... She loved it,' her father, Tom Smedinghoff, said. 'She was tailor-made for this job.'

Smedingoff, a Johns Hopkins graduate, and the other Americans were on a mission to donate books to Afghan students on Saturday when their convoy was rammed by a suicide car bomber.

Three Americans soldiers and a civilian Defense Department employee were killed along with Smedingoff. Four other diplomats were injured, one critically.

The attack came when the Americans' convoy intersected with a convoy carrying the provincial governor. The governor was not injured, but an Afghan doctor was killed.

An American civilian adviser to the Afghan military was also killed in a separate attack in the east of the country, bringing the death toll to six.

It was the deadliest day for Americans since August 16 when seven soldiers died in a pair of attacks in Kandahar.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday railed against the 'cowardly' terrorists responsible for the attack.

Tragic: Anne Smedinghoff worked in Venezuela before she volunteered for Afghanistan

At a news conference with Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, Kerry described Smedinghoff as 'a selfless, idealistic woman who woke up yesterday morning and set out to bring textbooks to school children, to bring them knowledge.'

'Anne and those with her,' Kerry said, 'were attacked by the Taliban terrorists who woke up that day not with a mission to educate or to help, but with a mission to destroy. A brave American was determined to brighten the light of learning through books, written in the native tongue of the students she had never met, whom she felt it incumbent to help.'

The violence - hours after the U.S. military's top officer arrived for consultations with Afghan and U.S.-led coalition officials - illustrates the instability plaguing the nation as foreign forces work to pull nearly all their combat troops out of the country by the end of 2014.

The attacks came just days after insurgents stormed a courthouse, killing more than 46 people in one of the deadliest attacks of the war, now in its 12th year.

Smedinghoff's father Tom told the Chicago Tribune she had met Kerry when he visited Afghanistan last month. She has helped organize the Secretary of State's trip to the country last year, he said.

He said his daughter died doing what she loved and believed in.

Passionate: Smedinghoff joined the Foreign Service out of college and was first posted in Venezuela. She later volunteered to go to Afghanistan

'She was living in a compound that was heavily fortified and she was always trying to get out and do things for the population,' he said.

He said family members would tease her about signing up for a less dangerous location, maybe London or Paris.

'She said, "What would I do in London or Paris? It would be so boring,"' her father recalled.

He said she would spend her free time traveling as much as possible.

Mr Smedinghoff said his daughter and her colleagues knew the assignments were dangerous, though she spent most of her time at the U.S. Embassy compound.

Tragedy: Six American troops and civilians and an Afghan doctor were killed in attacks on Saturday in southern and eastern Afghanistan as the U.S. military's top officer began a weekend visit

Trips outside were in heavily armored convoys — as was Saturday's deadly outing.

'It's like a nightmare, you think will go away and it's not,' he said. 'We keep saying to ourselves, we're just so proud of her, we take consolation in the fact that she was doing what she loved.'

She joined the State Department immediately after finishing college at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

Her first post was in Venezuela, 
another nation where the U.S. is struggling diplomatically. When her 
tour there ended, she volunteered to go to Afghanistan.

'She
tragically gave her young life working to give young Afghans the 
opportunity to have a better future,' Kerry said in a statement. 'We 
also honor the U.S. troops and Department of Defense civilian who lost 
their lives, and the Afghan civilians who were killed today as they 
worked to improve the nation they love.'

Taliban
spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi claimed responsibility for the attack in 
Zabul and said the bomber was seeking to target either a coalition 
convoy or the provincial governor .

'We were waiting for one of them,' Ahmadi said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.

'It was our good luck that both appeared at the same time.'

The deaths bring the number of foreign military troops killed this year to 30, including 22 Americans.

Provincial Governor Mohammad Ashraf Nasery, who survived the attack in Qalat, said the explosion occurred in front of a hospital and a coalition base housing a provincial reconstruction team, or PRT. International civilian and military workers at the PRT train Afghan government officials and help with local development projects.

Nasery said the car bomb exploded as his convoy was passing the hospital. He said the doctor was killed, and two of his bodyguards and a student from the school were wounded.

'The governor's convoy was at the gate of the school at the same time the (coalition) convoy came out from the PRT,' said provincial police chief General Ghulam Sakhi Rooghlawanay. 'The suicide bomber blew himself up between the two convoys.'

Nasery said he thought his convoy was the intended target.

'I'm safe and healthy,' he told the AP in a telephone interview.

Adventure: Smedingoff's family said she traveled the world and joined the Foreign Service so that he could help people across the world

Insurgents have stepped up attacks around the country in recent weeks as Afghanistan enters what could be one of the most critical periods following the U.S. invasion in late 2001 that ousted the Taliban.

The majority of U.S. and coalition forces are expected to begin a significant drawdown in the latter part of this year, leaving Afghan forces in charge of security across the country within months. Afghanistan also is gearing up for a presidential election next spring, and the Taliban have not yet accepted an offer to engage in peace talks in the Gulf state of Qatar.

There currently are about 100,000 international troops in Afghanistan, including 66,000 from the United States. The U.S. troop total is scheduled to drop to about 32,000 by early next year, with the bulk of the decline occurring during the winter months.

While there has been no final decision on the size of the post-2014 force, U.S. and NATO leaders say they are considering a range of between 8,000 and 12,000 - most of them trainers and advisers.
