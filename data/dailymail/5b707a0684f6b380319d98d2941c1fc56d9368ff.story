Asylum seekers trying to reach Australia could be housed on Indonesia's uninhabited islands, under a plan being proposed by that country's ministers.

Human rights advocated say the scheme would make those seeking asylum hostages in the country. 

Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno has suggested the idea so the asylum seekers 'don't disturb the public'.

Asylum seekers trying to reach Australia could be housed on Indonesia's uninhabited islands, under a plan being proposed by that country's ministers; above, a group of about 120 Australian-bound asylum seekers, mostly from Afghanistan and Iran, are evacuated by Indonesian authorities from a tanker in Marak port in April 2012 following a two-day stand-off

He has suggested Galang Island, Batam, in the country's northwest. The island was used to accommodate 250,000 refugees during the Vietnam War between 1979 and 1996.

The asylum seekers expenses would be covered by the Indonesian government who would work alongside non-governmental organizations - such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). 

Purdijatno is one of three senior Indonesian government ministers who have championed the plan to President Joko Widodo.

The suggestion follows last week's decision by Australia's federal government to lock out asylum seekers who registered after July 1. They will also accept 150 less asylum seekers who are awaiting resettlement from Indonesia, reducing yearly numbers from 600 to 450.

According to the World Bulletin Human Rights Minister Yasonna Hamonangan Laoly said the unclear status of refugees or asylum seekers would make them hostages in the country.

He said: 'It is the right [policy] for Australia, but it will weigh on us,' said Laoly.

Indonesia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Retno LP Marsudi says the plan goes against the Convention on Refugees and Indonesia's international duty.

He said: 'If the responsibility to resolve the problem only burdens transit countries, then it is not fair.' 

In April 2014 the United Nations refugee agency in Jakarta reported that there were about 10,000 asylum seekers and refugees in Indonesia, the majority from the Middle East. The majority are Muslims hoping to move to Australia.

Meanwhile, waves of refugees and asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Iraq and Myanmar continue to flow in. Most have travelled across continents in crowded leaky boats that are liable to capsize.
