LeBron James is working hard to keep himself in shape as he continues to consider his next move, snapping himself on Instagram working hard in the gym - with his mum!

The NBA superstar's destiny is currently in his own hands after recently opting out of his Miami Heat contract to become an unrestricted free agent.

He is set to become a free agent on July 1 and will be free to join 
any team he wishes, but that could still be the Miami Heat. But he is willing to leave the franchise, if that’s what it will take to win more NBA championships.

Fellow NBA star Kevin Durant, the 2014 MVP who plays for Oklahoma City Thunder, has jumped to the defence of James, who has been heavily criticised in some quarters for his decision.

'I don’t know what the big deal is,' Durant told USA Today. 'As a player, I think that’s the best way to go about it.

'You have all your options. It’s better for you as a player to opt out. You can get a bigger deal, get more years, you never know what happens. If you opt in, you pass up on that.'I didn’t know what the big deal was. I’m sure it was a decision that he made, something that he was thinking about for him and his family.'

'He switched teams. He’s not the first guy to do it. He decided to opt out. He’s not the first guy to do it.

'Sometimes a lot of people criticize him for doing normal things. Tim Duncan went into free agency before and he got courted by a few teams.

'We’ll see what happens with me, but everybody has done the same thing and he’s not the first.'
