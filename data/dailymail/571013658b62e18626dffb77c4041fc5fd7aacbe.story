Britain's most violent prisoner Charles Bronson has disowned his younger brother - after he auctioned off cartoons he'd drawn for their mother

Britain's most violent prisoner Charles Bronson has disowned his younger brother - after he allegedly auctioned off gifts their mother.

The 62-year-old, who changed his name to Charles Salvador last year in tribute to his beloved Salvador Dali, was first jailed for armed robbery in 1974.

But he has since earned a reputation as 'the most violent prisoner in Britain' thanks to a long rap sheet of brutal attacks on prison officers and fellow inmates.

Now in solitary at HMP Wakefield, Bronson - real name Michael Peterson - has labeled his brother Mark a traitor after finding out that six items that were meant to be gifts to his 85-year-old mum Eira had been sold off.

Bronson, speaking from his cell in a taped conversation released by those campaigning for his release this week, said he would 'never forgive' his brother or cousin Lorraine Salvage and her husband Andy - who organised the auction.

The auction of 200 items included drawings, t-shirts, sweatshirts and personal items. 

It was held at JP Humbert auction house on October 9 last year - making around £5,500.

But he was adamant he had never given permission for all of the items to be sold off - and is now demanding the six 'gifts' be returned to him by the successful bidders.

Speaking this week, Bronson - aka Salvador - said: 'I never even really wanted that auction.

'I done it as a favour (to Mark, Lorraine and Andy) - and out of the auction I got £5,500. I gave my brother £5,500.

'What I saw in the auction booklet I couldn't believe it - it made me so angry - there were six items that I gave my mother, six gifts - and they sold.

'So they sold my mother's gifts - that's my brother done that, my brother, and my cousin Lorraine (Salvage) and Andy (her husband).

'They sold my mother's gifts - now that's unforgivable.

'I was doing them a favour - I don't need the money - I did it for them.'

He went on to call them arrogant traitors: 'They are not my family or my friends they are traitors.

'The six people that bought my mother's gifts - I want them back - whatever you paid for them I will give you the same money plus a drink for New Year, but I want them six gifts back and I want them to go back to my mother.'

Bronson was jailed for life in 2000 after taking prison art teacher Phil Danielson hostage at HMP Hull in February 1999 after he criticised one of his sketches. Pictured is a piece of his distinctive artwork

Bronson  - who has changed his name to Salvador - now says he has put his violent past behind him and is looking for a peaceful life creating his artworks

Lorraine Etherington, who befriended Bronson four years ago and runs the Charlie Bronson Appeal Fund, said Bronson was 'very upset' that the items had been sold.

Ms Etherington, who along with Lorraine Salvage (Bronson's cousin) handed in a petition of 10,000 signatures calling for Bronson's release to Downing Street last August, said: 'Charlie was extremely upset to see the items that had sold.

'As his statement testifies, personal items to his mother, clothing, and confidential psychiatric reports were sold as well as art.

'The items signed to his mother were the biggest upset to him (and) they were sold without his knowledge.

Last year Salvador had two years added to his sentence after attacking a prison governor at HMP Woodhill

Clothes worn by Charles Bronson  also went under the hammer in a sale that had been expected to raise thousands of pounds

'As a consequence of the events that have unfolded, and how people have behaved, Charlie feels he has been used by his own family.

'Due to the way money has been divided up, he also feels he has been ripped off.'

Mark Peterson, 53, said his brother gave permission for the auction. The money was to be partly donated to charity after the sale.  

Bronson was jailed for life in 2000 after taking prison art teacher Phil Danielson hostage at HMP Hull in February 1999 after he criticised one of his sketches.

Due to the controversial nature of the material, the auction operated on a 'no estimate, no reserve' basis, but previous paintings by the artist have fetched more than £1,000

Mr Salvador says he has put his violent past behind him and is looking for a peaceful life creating his artworks

He has convictions for wounding, criminal damage, GBH, false imprisonment, blackmail and threatening to kill - and has taken hostages in 10 prison sieges, attacked at least 20 prison officers and caused £500,000 in damage in rooftop protests.

Last year he had two years added to his sentence after attacking a prison governor at HMP Woodhill. 

Despite the latest incidents, the muscle-bound convict - who is said to do 2,000 push-ups a day – recently claimed his violent days ended more than a decade ago.

Mr Salvador now says he has put his violent past behind him and is looking for a peaceful life creating his artworks.
