Cash-strapped hospital chiefs are spending vast amounts on sending mental health patients into private care after they axed more than 1,000 NHS beds - to save money.

Damning figures compiled by MailOnline show the soaring amount paid to private firms to provide 'out-of-area' beds, which have to be used if publicly-funded beds run out.

These beds can be up to hundreds of miles from patients' homes and cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds, but have been used increasingly as NHS mental health wards are cut back.

Figures provided by 22 mental health trusts show they spent £38.2million on private sector out-of-area beds in 2013/14 - two and a half times the £14.7million they spent in 2011/12.

Those same trusts cut back their own acute mental health beds – the ones used for serious breakdowns and psychotic episodes - by 6.1 per cent over the same period, from 4,332 to 4,066.

The figures, released to MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act, prompted outrage from leading mental health charities and Labour's shadow public health minister.

Mark Winstanley, chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said: 'Sending people away from home for treatment, while cutting beds in local mental health wards, makes no sense financially and causes human misery.

'Not only is this a bad use of vital NHS resources, it is also very distressing for people because it delays them from getting treatment and cuts them off from their family and friends.

'Everyone who needs a hospital bed should be able to get one close to home, no matter where they live or what their circumstances are.'

Mind policy chief Louise Rubin said the figures suggested bed cuts - which hospitals justify as modernising out-of-date wards and providing more private rooms - were 'short-sighted'.

'Historical underfunding, compounded by cuts over three consecutive years, have left mental health services close to breaking point at a time when more and more people need support.

'We are very concerned that people are not getting the help they need when in crisis, especially given reports of falling numbers of beds and increasing numbers of people being sent miles across the country to receive care.'

Isolated: Nikki Mattocks was just 14 when she was sent to a mental health ward 30 miles from her home

One victim was 17-year-old Nikki Mattocks.

She started to hear voices and self-harm when she was just 14 and was later diagnosed with depression and a borderline personality disorder.

But there were not the right beds available in her local hospital in Croydon, south London - so for five weeks she was sent 30 miles away to Woking, Surrey, and Maidstone, Kent.

Her father David, a window cleaner, had to borrow money to afford to see her.

'It was an hour's drive each way,' she said. 'He came to see me as much as he could but he had to work more hours and borrow money.

'I was so isolated. I had to go without seeing any of my friends because they didn't know how to get to me and couldn't afford it.

'One of the main ways I had got through it was to have people around me so it was a lot harder being so out of touch.'

Nikki, who now plans to study mental health nursing at university in September, said: 'I was sent to private hospitals twice because they had no beds.

'I can't even imagine how much that cost them. It seems like such a waste. It just doesn't make sense.'

The figures obtained by MailOnline are just a snapshot of the picture across Britain, because the other NHS trusts we asked did not or could not respond to our requests in full.

But the figures come just two months after the Royal College of Nursing warned  care was at crisis point, with 1,500 mental health beds closed down since 2010.

General secretary Dr Peter Carter told MailOnline demand has risen by almost a third since 2010.

'It’s a false economy to make these sorts of cuts,' he said.

'This increased NHS spending on private sector beds is a sign that the health service lacks capacity and urgently needs to increase its own provision.

'This short-sighted approach also undermines the quality of patient care.

'Inadequate provision means there’s a severe lack of mental health beds in many communities and too many patients have to go hundreds of miles away from home to access a service.

'Some patients with serious mental illnesses are having to wait until their health deteriorates to such an extent that they have to be detained before they start getting specialist care.

'Children with mental health problems have been placed in police cells because there aren’t beds available.' 

One of the worst offenders was the South London and Maudsley NHS trust, which leaped from spending £1.8million in 2011/12 to £5.5million last year.

It admitted the increase was due to a 'huge demand on our services and the consequent need for some of our patients to be admitted to overspill beds managed by private sector organisations.'

But it insisted costs are expected to come down this year after 'significant changes' including more information for nurses, more funding and a specialist team to monitor private spending.

Another of the worst offenders was the Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust.

It spent just £121,000 on private beds in 2011/12, but this rose to £1.2million the next year and an eye-watering £5.7million the year after.

That figure, apparently the most drastic increase in Britain, was originally revealed by Green party campaigner Ed Targett who described it as a 'scandal'.

The Kent and Medway trust insisted running out of beds was not the only reason patients had to be placed in private care. 'Reasons may include a specific specialist need for certain conditions or disorders which is not provided on an inpatient basis within our Trust,' a spokesman said.

'Other reasons may include the inability of a service user to be able to travel to the nearest NHS inpatient unit and a private sector bed is in fact closer to their home.'  

The 22 trusts chosen were the only ones to provide complete information in response to a Freedom of Information request by MailOnline.

Out of area beds also include money paid from one NHS hospital to another, not just money paid to private firms. However, our requests asked for information only about private sector beds. 

Worst offenders: The South London and Maudsley trust spent £5.5million - a leap of £3.7m in just two years

Just three of the 22 health trusts reduced the amount they spent on private beds - and just three increased the number of beds on their own wards.

In some areas, bed cuts were drastic. One trust alone, Norfolk and Suffolk, axed 74 mental health beds from its stock of 322 in just two years - a cut of almost a quarter.

At the other end of England, Avon and Wiltshire axed 42 beds from its 2011 stock of 209 - which had already been drastically reduced from the 249 it had in 2009.

Just three Avon and Wiltshire patients were placed in private sector beds in the year before the General Election. Four went to the private sector the next year, 13 the year after, and 32 the year after that. Yet in 2013/14, the number skyrocketed to 96 - costing NHS chiefs £1.4million.

Criticism: Labour's Luciana Berger. The government said it was introducing new ways to cut the spend

Labour shadow health minister Luciana Berger condemned the figures.

She told MailOnline: 'Instead of prioritising mental health as they promised, the Government has cut mental health services more than other hospital services.

'We have seen increased waiting times, people having to travel hundreds of miles to get the help they need or not getting any help at all.'  

Dr Martin McShane, NHS England's director for people with long term conditions, said: 'We know mental health services across the country are facing challenges and it can be difficult to ensure capacity is always at the right point in the system.

'However, we have announced the first waiting times and access standards in mental health for both psychological therapies and early intervention for psychosis.

'This is intended to help rebalance the system focusing initially on reducing waiting times for people with anxiety, depression, eating disorders and first episode psychosis.

'We want to ensure patients are able to access high quality care at an early stage, reducing demand for acute admissions.'

The Department of Health said it has new measures to stop mental health patients ending up in police cells, and is spending £120million to reduce the amount of time people had to wait for NHS treatment.

A spokesman added the government has invested £450million since 2010 to improve access to talking therapies, helping almost 1million people. 

'The Government has made it clear that beds must always be available for those who need them,' the spokesman added.

'For the first time ever we're collecting data on people travelling long distances for care so that services can be held to account.

'We are going further than ever before to put mental health on a par with physical health and we expect NHS Trusts, who have committed to making this a reality, to ensure mental health doesn't lose out in local spending.'
