Three Ukrainian traffic police officers have been killed after unknown gunmen wearing camouflage uniforms opened fire on them.

The incident took place this morning near the main railway station in Donetsk - the largest city in eastern Ukraine, where clashes between government troops and pro-Russia separatists are ongoing.

Ukraine's interior ministry said at least two camouflage wearing gunmen shot dead three traffic police officers and left a third in a serious condition, before escaping the scene.

The murder of three traffic police officer came as a group of former pro-Russian separatists joined forces with Ukrainian troops to guard checkpoints in Donetsk and allow government soldiers to pass through on what was described as an 'anti-terrorist operation.

Earlier today Ukraine's president shook up the leadership of his struggling military, appointing a new defense minister and top general tasked with stamping out the corruption that has left the country's armed forces faltering before a pro-Russian insurgency.

President Petro Poroshenko denounced the 'complete collapse' of the government's ability to supply the armed forces during an angry speech in parliament this morning.

He won approval for his choice of Valery Heletey as defense minister, replacing Mikhailo Koval, while Lieutenant General Viktor Muzhenko was appointed chief of the military's general staff.

'Today the revival of the army is starting from the scratch, the army which is capable of fighting and winning,' Poroshenko said in parliament.

'I have witnessed that during meetings with soldiers and officers while visiting the zone of anti-terrorist operations - the army which knows how to and is able to defend its people and country,' he added.

Kiev has struggled to re-assert control over the country's industrial east, where fighting between government troops and pro-Russia separatists has claimed more than 400 lives since April.

The army has been unable to prevent rebels from occasionally cruising the countryside in armored vehicles or to dislodge them from the occupied town of Slovyansk.

Heletey is a former senior Interior Ministry official who headed the government service that protects top officials in Kiev.

Poroshenko
 also appointed Yury Kosyuk, an agriculture magnate and one of Ukraine's
 richest men, to oversee defense issues in the presidential 
administration, and promised to 'purge the army of thieves and 
grafters.'

Accusations of corruption have been rife as Kiev's operation against the rebels continues.

Poroshenko's forceful words contrasted with his emphasis on starting a peace process voiced in his inaugural address June 7.

He declared a unilateral cease-fire for 10 days in hopes rebels would lay down their arms and join talks. But the cease-fire was repeatedly violated and ultimately expired.

Rebels in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where more Russian speakers live, have declared independence and occupied government buildings.

The insurrection started after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was driven from office by a protest movement among people wanting closer ties with the European Union instead of Russia.

Russia called Yanukovych's ouster a coup by radical nationalists and seized Ukraine's Russian-speaking Crimea region. Ukraine says Russia is now backing the insurgency.

Poroshenko was elected in a special election May 25 to replace Yanukovych.
