Tragic L'Wren Scott's family have spoken of their fury at Sir Mick Jagger over the Rolling Stones' legal battle to claim $13million from insurers after canceling tour dates in the wake of her death.

Miss Scott's closest loved ones are astonished by Jagger's 'unbelievable' decision to reap financial settlement and question his commitment to his girlfriend of 13 years, who hanged herself on March 17. 

Miss Scott's sister Jan Shane was so upset by the Rolling Stones front man's actions, who the family accuse of 'opening up old wounds,' she couldn't bring herself to comment. 

But her husband Rob, 58, spoke for the family and told MailOnline exclusively: 'We just can't believe Mick's doing what he's doing.

L'Wren Scott's death prompted the Rolling Stones to postpone a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand, but their insurers are battling with the band to not pay out for losses

 'Jan is trying to put it all behind her, it's a really troubling part of her life losing her sister, and he's in a legal battle with some insurers.'

Speaking at the couple's home near Salt Lake City, Utah, he said: 'The guy [Jagger] doesn't need the money, I laughed when the insurance company turned down his claim.

'All the s*** that Mick is claiming about being unstable, it's ridiculous he's trying to get his way. In a way, I'm not surprised he's doing it. The guy is just unbelievable.'

The band postponed the Australian and New Zealand dates of their world tour when Miss Scott died in March of this year, then made a claim for the costs against their insurance policy.

But the insurers are refusing to pay out, saying the policy did not cover suicide.

A judge has ruled that the insurers will be allowed to seek documents and testimony from Miss Scott's brother, Randall Bambrough, to find out more about her mental state.

However, Mr Bambrough told a local newspaper that he had yet to receive a summons.

The documents, filed by the insurers and obtained by MailOnline from the federal court in Salt Lake City, claim Jagger's 'acute traumatic stress illness' was 'due to known, pre-existing physical, psychological and medical conditions of Miss Scott'.

It's alleged Miss Scott 'had been suffering from a mental illness' and 'either received, or at least had been recommended, medical attention', therefore her death should not be considered to be 'sudden and unforeseen'.

The underwriters make reference to Miss Scott's 'lack of care, diligence and/or prudent behavior in committing suicide by hanging herself', which they believe 'increased the risk and/or likelihood of a loss otherwise recoverable under the policy'.

In the 105-page document the eight insurers, led by Cathedral Capital and Talbot 2002 Underwriting Capital Limited, both based in London, claim these points are suitable reasons for denial in settling the claim from the Rolling Stones.

The Stones' insurance policy was covered for $24million, while the tour was expected to make $44million.

An autopsy confirmed Miss Scott's death was suicide after she was found in her luxury Manhattan apartment.

Jagger developed the acute traumatic stress disorder after losing his long-time partner, according to the papers. 

Symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, feelings of guilt and emotional numbness. If the disorder persists for more than one month, it becomes traumatic stress disorder.

The singer was subsequently instructed by doctors to take a month off, forcing the Stones to cancel live shows in Australia and New Zealand.

However the underwriters have accused the rocker of failing to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist before abandoning the scheduled dates Down Under.

Rob, shaking his head in disbelief, told MailOnline: 'I read that he's claiming $12.7 million due to the cancellation of the [Rolling Stones] tour and I can't understand that. L'Wren left her entire estate to him and that was valued around the same amount.

'It seems heartless. How distraught could he have really been, seriously? It was only a month or two after L'Wren's death he was with this ballerina or whatever. I mean how distraught [was Mick]?'

Defending his late sister-in-law Miss Scott he says: 'L'Wren wasn't mentally unwell, you know it's just some times life catches up to you.'

Rob told how Jan, 54, is 'finding it hard' to discuss her sister right now, adding: 'The whole situation is a big ball of weight being dragged behind her and it's opening up old wounds.'

The underwriters claim suicide was not covered in the $13million policy taken out by the Stones if they were forced to cancel their tour.

The Rolling Stones frontman published a statement on his website soon after  L'Wren Scott's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life

Last month, the insurers also  filed a lawsuit in New York's Federal court, and subpoenaed Adam Glassman, the executor of Scott's will; the New York City medical examiner; and Brittany Penebre, her British assistant.

The move was an attempt to gain access to any emails or messages about an 'actual or alleged attempt at self harm by Miss Scott' as well as her general mental health, or an 'actual or alleged suicide attempt'.

Miss Scott, a fashion designer and model, was 49 when her body was found in her Manhattan apartment by Miss Penebre. An autopsy confirmed her death was suicide.

Her fashion business had been £4.6million in debt and she had abruptly cancelled her show at London Fashion Week, supposedly due to technical difficulties.

There were also reports she and Jagger had split up, leaving her 'devastated', although Jagger's spokesman denied this. 

Documents filed at the district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, reveal Miss Scott was on a long list of family on the Stones' insurance policy.

Also on Jagger's list were his ex-wives Jerry Hall and Bianca Jagger, former girlfriends, seven children and four grandchildren.

The documents give a fascinating insight into how the insurance policy worked. The revenue for the tour was expected to be £28million, and this could have gone up if 15 extra European dates were added. The insurers agreed to pay out up to 50 per cent in case of tragedy.

A spokesman for the Rolling Stones declined to comment.

Lawyers for the insurers did not return calls for comment.

Hell-raisers: Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards

The Rolling Stones may still be going strong, but their court documents reveal that their disgruntled insurers are well aware of the toll taken by years of the rockstar lifestyle.

Hidden among the fine print of their tour insurance policy is a long list of exceptions – health issues for which each member of the ageing band is not covered.

For example, and perhaps not surprisingly, the insurers say they will not pay out if anything happens to guitarist Keith Richards related to 'alcohol abuse, liver failure and/or disease and osteoarthritis'.

More unusually, anything to do with the injury that he suffered in 2006, when he was hit on the head by a coconut, will not be covered either.

For Ronnie Wood, anything to do with 'alcohol abuse' is also not covered. The exemptions for drummer Charlie Watts include any conditions related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004 or his sciatica.

The documents show the band expected to receive $46.6million for their tour. Just three shows in Japan were worth $14.3million.
