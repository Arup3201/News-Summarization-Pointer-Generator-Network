A high school football game descended into chaos as people ran away in terror as a gunman wearing camouflage opened fire walking down a street.

The 51-year-old gunman was shot dead by police an hour later at the scene in a quiet area by Issaquah High School near Seattle, Washington.

He had sent spectators diving under open tiered seating and was fatally shot later on when he refused to put down his bolt-action hunting rifle.

He reportedly walked around half a mile towards Issaquah High, where a middle school football game was going on, and local primary school Clark Elementary.

Armed officers ran onto the football field and took about 120 team members and supporters to a safer position under the stands.

‘A SWAT team showed up on site, fully loaded, fully geared up, just racing onto the field,’ opposition coach John Rudolph told KOMO.

Other people on the street ran for cover and described hearing around 20 shots, reported the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

'We never had a chance to negotiate with 
him, talk to him. He was shooting, and 
the officers shot back'

Police said nobody was injured by the gunman and they have no idea what his motivations were for the incident early Saturday afternoon.

‘We never had a chance to negotiate with him, talk to him,’ Sergeant Urquhart told KOMO. ‘He was shooting, and the officers shot back.’

One woman walking nearby with a baby said she started running when hearing bangs and they took cover inside a Good Samaritan’s car.

The gunman, who has not yet been identified, was shot dead when he refused to speak to the officers and aimed his weapon at them.
