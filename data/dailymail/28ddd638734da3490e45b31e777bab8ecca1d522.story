A woman who caused a horror car crash which killed a four year-old's parents and left him orphaned was jailed for a year earlier today.

Debra Weston, 41, admitted losing control of her green Land Rover Discovery and smashing into a family's Ford Focus.

Stephen Durber, 30, and his wife Samantha 27, who were travelling in the back of the Ford with their son Lucas, died at the scene.

The youngster survived with two broken legs and a head injury.

Witnesses described seeing Weston's Discovery swerve towards the wrong side of the road before 'fishtailing' as she tried to regain control of it.

She suffered a broken ankle and her teenage son who was a passenger suffered a broken leg.

Weston, of Nottingham, pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by careless driving after the crash on the A47 near Sacrewell Farm, Cambridgeshire, on August 25 2013.

She was jailed for 12 months and disqualified from driving for three years at Peterborough Crown Court.

Judge Sean Enright said: 'It is clear that Stephen and Samantha were a happy and hard working couple known for their sound principals and sense of fun.

'They were good parents. Nothing that I can say can capture the essence of this couple and the tragic and enduring loss to their family and son.

'I hope that no member of the family will hear the sentence I pass today and say - well is that the value that society places on our loved ones?

'Because it is not. This defendant has pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving - not dangerous driving - and I am required to consider and apply case law and guidance sanctioned by law.

'In particular I need to balance the culpability of the defendant, which is low, and the tragic consequences which resulted.'

Stephen's brother David Durber who lived near the Peterborough couple, said: 'We believe justice has been served.'
