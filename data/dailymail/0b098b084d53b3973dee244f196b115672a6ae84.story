These photographs show the moment a smartly-dressed man was caught in the act stealing sandbags from a 60 metre wall protecting homes from rising floodwaters.

The barrier, constructed by the Navy in Datchet, Berkshire, has been targeted four times in recent days, prompting residents to take action.

The thieving has been so rife that entire sections of the wall have had to be rebuilt.

Caught in the act: Residents in Datchet captured the moment a smartly dressed man apparently stole a number of sandbags from a 60 metre wall erected by the Navy to protect homes from the rising floodwaters

Repeat thefts: People living in the submerged Berkshire town said the sandbag barrier has been targeted four times in recent days, forcing people to rebuild large sections of the wall

Residents have formed a home guard vigilante group to monitor the barrier, with a rota round the clock of two hour shifts, to curb the stealing.

The sandbags were put up by the Navy because of fears that a nearby wall holding back powerful flood waters could soon give way.

Speaking on Tuesday at a national press conference, Mr Cameron said: 'Clearly the most serious developing situation is in the Thames Valley.

'Military deployment began with the building of a sixty metre wall at Datchet.'

A resident has managed to take photographs of suspected thieves, including a man in a suit loading sandbags into the back of his grey van.

Two other men, also pictured, arrived at the same time in a van before making off with sandbags.

An eye-witness said: 'People have just been coming here and helping themselves, its outrageous.

'This is a wall put up by the Navy for a reason and was even mentioned by the Prime Minister, but little does he know parts of it have had to be rebuilt.

'The residents are saying enough is enough and have started a 24-hour watch. Hopefully it will be enough to deter these people.'

Retired HR worker Sue Blumsom, 65, who has lived in the town for 36 years, is among those taking turns to keep guard.

Ms Blumsom, whose garden and garage have been flooded, said: 'We are not happy about it.

'People have been coming along and taking what they want without thinking of anyone else. It is not very pleasant.'

Rumours are circulating in the town that a number of local businesses are among those to have taken sandbags from the Southlea Road wall.

Meanwhile beleaguered flood victims have hit out at so-called 'grief capitalists' who have been selling stolen sandbags at huge profits to vulnerable people.

In some cases, the makeshift flood defence measure has been sold for four or five times the normal price.

One elderly woman is said to have paid £80 for a couple of bags, such was the desperation to protect her home.

Anger: Datchet residents Susan Blumsom, left, and Maureen Charters, right, take their turn to guard the barrier

Underwater: Vast swathes of Datchet have been submerged for the last few days

Rota: Residents in Datchet have joined Mrs Blumsom and Mrs Charters, left, taking their turns to guard the wall of sandbags on a rota basis. Signs erected nearby say: 'Flood defences. Do not remove sandbags', right

Praise: Speaking at a national press conference Prime Minister David Cameron this week hailed the wall of sandbags as vital in protecting residents from the floodwaters

The community of Egham in Surrey has been battling with rising flood waters ever since Sunday night.

But after having to wait for sand bags to be delivered, some woke up the following day to find they had been stolen - and being sold to their neighbours.

To compound the misery, thieves have also targeted properties vacated by reluctant homeowners as the stagnant water creeps over the threshold.

Resident Sandra Slark said: 'It's outrageous and disgusting. The people here are suffering enough.

'To find their homes looted hours later, their possessions stolen - it's plain wrong.'

Her partner Martin Warner, who keeps returning regularly to check on their home after being evacuated on Tuesday, said: 'People need the sandbags so they are paying crazy money.

'You can't blame them. People are desperate. You hear people talk of paying £20 here and there for sandbags, and one person was charged £60 for two. An elderly woman paid £80.

'She just wanted to try and save her home, I guess - and you pay what it takes.'

Police were called in yesterday to observe as several tonnes of sand were rationed out to hundreds of weary homeowners who waited for up to four hours in the rain.

Today the sand has been limited to no more than six bags per household - where yesterday others were filling recycling bins.

Mother-of-one Katie Hyman, 29, who has lived in the community all her life, described the looting as 'disgusting'.

She said: 'How can you look at someone who is going through heartbreak and steal from them?

'How can you make money out of someone else who is suffering? It's terrible.'

Much of the sand has been donated by the Khalsa Aid Sikh community group in nearby Slough.

Jo Perandin, who has coordinated the Thames Flood crisis group of volunteers - which has converted a church hall into a makeshift office and aid dispatch centre - said: 'Khalsa have given us nearly 100 tonnes of sand.

'We cannot thank them enough. Nothing is too much trouble for them. They've really come to our need and we're so grateful.'

Around 1,000 people in Surrey have been evacuated since the flood water surged, with reports of up to 20 people staying in the same house in order to seek refuge locally.

Flood victims in Dorset have hit out at their local council, claiming townhall officials tried to charge them £7.50 for a single sandbag.

Homeowners called Christchurch Borough Council for help, fearing their riverside flats were about to be submerged for a second time in a month.

But they were told they would have to pay £30 for four sandbags.

Shocked: Paul Richards said it is 'disgraceful' that his local council is trying to charge residents for sandbags to protect their homes

Working out it would take 500 bags to protect their homes, the group faced a bill of £3,750.

The Conservative council's policy goes against government orders that local authorities should not be charging residents for sandbags.

And it flies in the face of Prime Minister David Cameron's repeated statements that 'money is no object' when it comes to local council's dealing with floods.

Paul Richards, 61, a retired undertaker, said: 'We have been requesting sandbags from the council to protect the building after our block was flooded downstairs last time.

'Our local councillor said that the council had no sandbags available and no money for the sandbags.

'She said they have FloodSax available for £7.50 each but considering we need at least 500, that is an awful lot of money.

'I was absolutely shocked. It's disgraceful.

'We all pay council tax and surely there is a duty of care from the council that they have to provide us with.

Affected: Eric Matthews is among the residents angry at Christchurch Borough Council in Dorset. The council said sandbags are available for emergencies and for residents whose homes are at risk of imminent flooding

'We've tried repeatedly over the past seven weeks to get some help, we're in a desperate position now and we need the most basic help.'

Steve Richards, whose dad Ken was evacuated from his ground floor last month, said: 'You switch on the TV and the Prime Minister is saying things like money is no object but clearly it is.'

Brandon Lewis MP, minister for local government, today said: 'There is no reason whatsoever for a council to charge for sandbags.'

Yet on its website, Christchurch council state that in times of flooding they do offer the free provision of sandbags to residential properties. 

Neil Farmer, strategic director at the council, said: 'We do have sandbags available for appropriate use when an emergency is called and these will be made available.

'It is neither reasonable nor practicable to provide an unlimited supply of sandbags to properties which have not been identified as at risk of imminent flooding.

'The council is committed to working with the residents in submitting the appropriate application to the Environment Agency for a flood relief scheme.

'This was declined by former residents in 1979.'
