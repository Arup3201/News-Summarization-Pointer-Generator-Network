Winning four Olympic medals takes nerves of steel and utter self-belief.

But Rebecca Adlington has found herself rather out of her depth in the world of reality TV, bursting into tears over her deep-seated body insecurities on I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here!

Now experts have warned Britain’s most successful swimmer could suffer psychological damage as they accused the ITV show’s makers of ‘deliberately manipulating’ Miss Adlington to increase viewer ratings.

Self-conscious: Rebecca Adlington becomes teary and upset as she admits Amy Willerton made her feel insecure about her body on 'I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here'

The retired athlete covered herself in a one-piece swimsuit on last night’s show, a day after she broke down confessing she has struggled with abusive comments about her looks for years.

The outburst was triggered by the sight of fellow contestant Amy Willerton, 21, a beauty queen who has been wearing a revealing bikini to soap herself under a waterfall on set.

Last night Miss Adlington again became tearful during an interview  as she discussed her body hang-ups triggered by Miss Willerton.

Psychologist Dr Rick Norris expressed fears for Miss Adlington.

Worries: Psychologist Dr Rick Norris expressed fears for Miss Adlington

He said: ‘It is no accident that they put her in with a beauty queen.

'It was bound to make her feel uncomfortable.’

He conceded Miss Adlington, 24, joined the show of her own free will and was carefully checked by psychologists before taking part, but added: ‘Rebecca has been trained to overcome physical challenges but she may not be so well equipped to deal with the psychological pressures of being in the public eye as a reality TV contestant.

‘I worry that in the future she may regret laying herself so bare in front of millions of people.

'There is a risk that the programme could damage her long-term self-esteem.’

An ITV spokesman said: ‘The welfare of the celebrities is of the utmost importance and medical staff are on hand at all times.’
