It is a British tradition that has brought joy to millions of families for more than 150 years.

Now one of Britain's favourite dishes, fish and chips, has been voted as the country's greatest-ever double act.

The meal polled above the likes of Posh and Becks and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in a survey of the top 50 British combinations.

The survey asked 1,000 adults to choose their favourite British pairing, from areas such as comedy, music, food, business or sport.

Second in the list was tea and biscuits, 
followed closely by comedy duo Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise, who polled
 at number three.

The rest of the top ten was dominated by classic food pairings, including bacon and eggs, roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, sausage and mash and strawberries and cream.

Other duos which clinched a top ten spot included The Two Ronnies, otherwise known as Ronnie Corbett and Ronnie Barker, and fictitious duo Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, played in the latest BBC series by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.

The list showed Britons' appetite for comedy, with Steptoe and Son and Delboy and Rodney Trotter, from Only Fools and Horses, both featured in the top 20.  Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders polled at number 22.

The musical world was also well represented. Beatles songwriters John Lennon and Paul McCartney, pop rock duo Chas and Dave and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards from The Rolling Stones all featured in the list.

The list also included much-loved British brands, including Marks & Spencer, which came in at number 10, Procter & Gamble, Rolls-Royce and Fortnum and Mason.

Two Coronation Street stalwarts also made the list, including Jack and Vera Duckworth and Newton & Ridley, the fictional brand of beer served in the TV show's pub, Rovers Return.

From sport, there was Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean and football pundits Ian St John and Jimmy Greaves.

Other pairings included Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Carry On's Barbara Windsor and Sid James and Posh and Becks, who polled at number 42 - one spot below sitcom couple Gavin and Stacey.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge featured at number 28, two spots below Sooty and Sweep.

TV presenters Ant and Dec, gin and tonic and Wallace and Gromit were also featured in the list.

The survey was commissioned by chocolate brand Elizabeth Shaw to launch their latest Flutes chocolate batons range.

A spokesman for the company said: 'We love our double acts and combinations in this country, from Posh and Becks to Wills and Kate, bacon and eggs to cheese and crackers.

'They all show just how well two different elements can go together to create something magical, whether it is showbiz, sport, food or business.'
