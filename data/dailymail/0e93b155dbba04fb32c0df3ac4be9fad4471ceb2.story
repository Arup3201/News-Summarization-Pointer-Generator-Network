Mikel Arteta can recall days standing on the game’s edge, watching the ball sailing through the sky towards Duncan Ferguson, so he does not hesitate to defend Arsene Wenger against accusations of too much flair and too little caution.

‘I’ve played in lots of different teams,’ said Arteta. ‘I’ve played long balls and short balls and, believe me, if you love football you want to play the Arsenal way.

‘When I joined Everton and we had big Duncan Ferguson, Alan Stubbs and David Weir, the football was very direct because of the players we had. David Moyes started to buy more quality players and tactics progressed, but at the start we were very physical.

‘We were the best in the league at doing that, so why would we not play long ball? That’s why he put me on the wing, so I could cross the ball, as I didn’t get it in midfield.

‘Arsenal don’t have to change. The manager believes in this style 100 per cent but we have to find our defensive solidity. It’s one thing to be cautious and another to be careless.’

Arsenal’s new captain is protective of the Wenger philosophy. The 32-year-old Basque shares the same principles not only in style of football but also regarding loyalty in the dressing room.

‘He defends his players 100 per cent and that’s something that matters,’ said Arteta.

That does not change if it is teenage full back Hector Bellerin or the club’s record signing Mesut Ozil, who responded to criticism last week with a goal at Aston Villa.

‘When you have players like Ozil with everything he involves — his price, his personality — people will either love him or not like him at all,’ said Arteta. ‘When you’re an artist, you’re never going to perform nine out of 10 every week. It’s much more difficult for a creative player to perform at that level.

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta used to play alongside Mauricio Pochettino during his time at PSG

Arteta has revealed Tottenham boss Pochettino used to treat him like a son when they were club team-mates

They met in Paris in 2001 and the bond remains unbroken, although it might be tested when Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta faces a Tottenham side managed by his former team-mate Mauricio Pochettino on Saturday. 

‘He was like a father figure for me,’ said Arteta, as he explained how centre half Pochettino took him under his wing when he joined Paris Saint-Germain on loan from Barcelona. 

‘He really looked after me as a young player and I appreciate what he did for me. It was the start of my career and I’d just come into the team. 

‘I was playing in front of the back four and he was the centre back, the captain. He has been one of my biggest influences and showed me how to behave as a footballer.' 

‘The opposition always try and stop you, so sometimes you don’t shine. And then people ask: “Why don’t you shine? You didn’t do anything in the game.” When that happens you get criticised, especially when it happens in big games. But you cannot deny Ozil is a special player: his movement, his calmness, his final ball is superb.’

Arteta has witnessed high quality at close quarters during a career spanning 15 years. ‘At Barcelona, we had Rivaldo and the way he hit the ball was unbelievable,’ said the Arsenal captain. ‘In terms of quality, technique, imagination, the best was probably Ronaldinho. Some of the things he did with the ball I had never seen in my life. It was ridiculous. But we have talented players at Arsenal.’

Arteta picked out Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. He lovingly described him as ‘one of my little joys’ and added: ‘The potential he has is second to none. If he really wants to, really focuses, he can go to the very top.

‘He has the speed and skill to become an unbelievable winger, but he has the vision of a midfielder, and that’s very difficult to find. Defensively, he needs to improve, but he has time and people to help him.’

Arteta admits he had started to wonder about Arsenal without Wenger. At two goals down to Hull in the FA Cup final, with the manager’s unsigned contract still on the table, doubts played on his mind.

‘He wasn’t clear with his future,’ said Arteta. ‘He always said he wanted to stay but he didn’t sign. In the semi-final — or even in the final — we never knew what was going to happen. If we lost the Hull game we’d be talking about a different story. That would have started a period of reflection and decision. It was a big game in Arsenal’s history. We won the first trophy in nine years.

‘You can go from being criticised to being hailed very quickly. But I worry for the young lads. When I came to the UK, what I liked about the culture was that clubs protected their players and made it hard for people to knock your confidence. But now it’s impossible.’
