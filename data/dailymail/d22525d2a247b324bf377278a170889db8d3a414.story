Labour's most powerful union baron last night threatened to slash funding to the party unless he is given even greater powers to dictate policy and impose candidates.

Unite boss Len McCluskey, who has funded Ed Miliband to the tune of £8million, said he was sick of being ‘taken for granted by people who welcome our money, but not our policy input’.

In a speech to union activists, he demanded that Labour shift further to the Left, saying he would not bankroll a party that was ‘a pinkish shadow of the present coalition’.

Demands: Unite leader Len McCluskey warned the union would not longer hand over money to the Labour party without getting anything in return

Mr McCluskey, known as ‘Red Len’ for 
his hard-Left views, attacked Mr Miliband’s handling of a vote-rigging 
row in Falkirk, branding it an ‘utter, utter disgrace’.

He said the row had brought relations
with the party to ‘breaking point’ and made it clear that funding is 
likely to be cut as a result.

Mr McCluskey warned that Labour’s 
income, 85 per cent of which is provided by the unions, could shrink, 
‘possibly quite dramatically’.

He would be demanding ‘enhanced 
policy input’ and ‘more of an impact on Parliamentary selections’ if 
Unite was to continue bankrolling the party.

It marks an escalation in the 
stand-off between the unions and Labour leader Ed Miliband who has moved
to shift the party’s relationship with its big money backer backers.

Since Mr Miliband became leader in 2010 Unite has given £8.4million to the Labour party.

But in the wake of the row over Unite allegedly trying to fix Labour’s candidate selection in Falkirk, he moved to overhaul the rules which would stop union members automatically becoming Labour party members.

Mr Miliband faced warnings that only around one in 10 union members would opt-in to the party, costing it millions of pounds in funding which it used to receive automatically.

In a wide-ranging speech yesterday Mr McCluskey claimed Unite is at a ‘turning point’ in its historic relationship with the Labour party.

Speaking to a meeting of Unite activists, he said strains in the link between Labour and the unions have been building up for years, at least since the advent of New Labour in the 1990s.

Row: Labour leader Ed Miliband has sought to overhaul the party's links to the unions

‘Those strains have been fuelled by the failures and disappointments of Labour in office, not least its refusal to seriously address the unique legal impediments trade unions have to work under in Britain.

‘They have been worsened by the feeling that for a long time we have been taken for granted by people who welcome our money, but not our policy input, who want to use our resources at election time but do not want our members as candidates.

‘And all this in an environment when ordinary people in all walks of life have become increasingly disengaged from and disenchanted with politics and politicians.’

Mr McCluskey welcomed changes to the historic arrangements for affiliating union members to Labour which have been put forward by party leader Ed Miliband.

A special conference will be held next Spring to agree details of the changes, under which union members would have to agree to opt-in to Labour membership.

But he warned the union would stop handing over money without strings attached. He said: ‘Certainly Unite will be using its political fund for a variety of initiatives and not just handing it over to the Labour Party as has generally happened up until now.’

Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said:  'This is proof that Ed Miliband’s proposed changes to Labour’s link with the unions would actually increase Len McCluskey’s control over Labour’s coffers.

'Len McCluskey has said he will use his increased bargaining power to demand Labour adopt the policies he wants. And he will still be able to fix Labour’s candidate selections and pick Labour’s leader.

'So nothing has changed. Ed Miliband would still be too weak to take the difficult decisions needed to cut the deficit or fix welfare. It would be the same old Labour with hardworking people paying the price.'

Unite leader Mr McCluskey said many people were saying that the relationship with Labour had to change even before a row flared over union members being signed up for party membership in Falkirk ahead of a selection meeting.

However Education Secretary Michael Gove said the proposed opt-in changes could strengthen union influence over the Labour Party

 ‘Ed Miliband has made some bold and far-reaching proposals for recasting the trade union relationship with the Labour Party. I know that some pundits were expecting me to reject them outright,’ Mr McCluskey added.

‘To re-run the experience of the last generation on this issue - the party leader says something, the unions reject it and have no positive proposals of their own, the first plan goes through anyway and we look like not just losers, but conservative losers.

‘Well, we all honour our movement's traditions, but this is one tradition overdue for a change. Unite is doing things differently in one area of our work after another, including politics.

‘We need to do things differently here too. We need to engage, rethink and see if we can find better ways to advance our ends.’

However Education Secretary Michael Gove said the proposed opt-in changes could strengthen union influence over the Labour Party.

At an event hosted by Populus in central London, he said: ‘It will be the case that fewer are automatically affiliated to the Labour Party as trade union members and that appears to be a diminution in trade union influence.

‘Actually, what it could lead to is the union's exercising more influence because, rather than money flowing automatically, money will go to the Labour Party depending on whether or not the trade union general secretaries, who retain control of their union's political funds, decide that the policies and the candidate selection of the Labour Party are in accordance with their wishes.

‘So, Len McCluskey doesn't lose anything, who doesn't lose any money. What he does gain is control over whether or not that money goes to Labour.’
