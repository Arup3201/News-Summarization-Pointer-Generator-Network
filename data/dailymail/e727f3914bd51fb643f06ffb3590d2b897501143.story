Criticism: Jacques Delors the former president of the European Commission

A key architect of the euro has claimed it was flawed from the start and  efforts by European leaders to tackle its problems have so far been 'too little, too late'.

Jacques Delors, the former president of the European Commission, said that ‘a fault in execution’ of the currency, rather than the concept itself, had led to the crisis.

Mr Delors, 86, who led the commission from 1985 to 1995, played a central role in the process that led to the creation of the euro in 1999.

But today he claimed political leaders had turned a blind eye to the weaknesses and imbalances of member states’ economies.

In his first interview in a decade, he said: ‘The finance ministers did not want to see anything disagreeable which they would be forced to deal with.’

The Frenchman said all member states had played a part in the euro’s downfall and that ‘everyone must examine their consciences’.

But he did single out Germany for insisting the European Central Bank must not support debt-stricken members for fear of fuelling inflation.

The problems were fuelled by ‘a combination of the stubbornness of the Germanic idea of monetary control and the absence of a clear vision from all the other countries’.

Crisis: One of the key architects of the single currency was Jacques Delors

Mr Delors famously clashed with Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s over his vision for a closer Europe.

But now he admits that Britons, whom he referred to as Anglo-Saxons, may have been right to express concerns that a single central bank and currency without a single state would be unstable.

Lord Lamont: Jacque Delors deserves 'credit' for his comment

‘They had a point’, he said.

His intervention, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, came as France and Germany edged towards closer fiscal union to head off a potentially disastrous collapse of the single currency.

Mr Delors insisted that all European countries had to share the blame for excessive borrowing by countries such as Italy and Greece that have brought the system to the brink of disaster.

Such is the scale of the crisis, he warned, that 'even Germany' will struggle to find a solution. 'Markets are markets. They are now bedevilled by uncertainty.'

According to Mr Delors, the UK is 'just as embarrassed as the Europeans by the 
financial crisis', as some of the measures put in place to deal with the
crisis pose a threat to British interests.

Today former chancellor Lord Lamont, who negotiated Britain's opt-out from the single currency, said Mr Delors deserved 'credit' for his comments.

He said: 'Jacques Delors' remarks are hugely significant, particularly his admission that those who said you cannot have a single currency without a single government 'had a point'.

Talks: French President Nicolas Sarkozy and David Cameron discussed the eurozone crisis this week

'All credit to Jacques Delors for finally admitting what so many people, including in Britain, denied.'

Prime Minister David Cameron has insisted British interests will be paramount if the European Union treaty is changed to help resolve the eurozone crisis.

He held talks in Paris yesterday with President Nicolas Sarkozy ahead of next week's crunch EU summit.

That gathering is expected to focus on discussions about whether fundamental treaty change will be needed to help deal with the crisis.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted yesterday that such reforms were necessary and hailed recent steps towards creating a 'fiscal union'.

She told the Bundestag that the eurozone crisis could not be solved in one fell swoop, urging long-term tighter fiscal integration.         

'Resolving the sovereign debt crisis is a process and this process will take years,' she said.             

'Marathon runners often say that the run becomes especially difficult at the 35 kilometre mark, but they also say that reaching the finish line is possible if you are conscious of the full challenge from the very start and approach it accordingly.    

'The one who starts fastest isn't necessarily the most successful. It is the one who is aware of what is involved in running the full distance.'  

British diplomats fear the 17 euro members could seek an agreement on new rules between themselves, effectively excluding other EU countries.
