The world's first test-tube baby paid tribute to her parents' bravery today - saying they stepped into the unknown by having her.

Louise Brown, 35, was born at Oldham General Hospital on July 25 1978 after her parents Lesley and John became the first people to successfully undergo in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

Her birth attracted controversy, with religious leaders expressing concern about the use of artificial intervention and some raising fears that science was creating 'Frankenbabies'.

However, it also paved the way for five million further IVF births.

Lesley died last year aged 64, following the death of her husband several years earlier.

Mrs Brown lives in Bristol with her husband, Wesley Mullinder, and in August the couple celebrated the birth of their second son Aiden.

Her sister Natalie, who was the first IVF baby to have a child, gave birth to her fourth child, Aeron, in August. There are now six grandchildren in the family.

Today the sisters planted a tree in memory of their parents at Bourn Hall - the Cambridgeshire clinic where the techniques and drugs were first developed.

Mrs Brown described how the breakthrough not only gave life to herself and her sister, but also to their own children.

She said: 'I don't know what would have happened to mum and dad if it hadn't work - it was what made them.'

'It's a shame she didn't meet Aeron and Aiden but being able to look after her grandchildren meant a lot to her. Having grandchildren and a wider family was part of her original dream.'

Her parents' pioneering role was only a by-product of their desire for a family, she said.

Controversy: The birth of Louise pictured with her father John, sister Natalie and mother Lesley when she was a teenager, sparked controversy - with some slamming the process for creating 'Frankenbabies'

'After nine years of trying I think mum just heard the words "you might be able to have a baby" and they were that desperate they would have done anything.

'I don't really think they knew it hadn't happened before and, in a way, that was good because it meant they believed it would work. They didn't really talk about the controversy. They wanted children and that was that.

In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a process where an egg is fertilised by sperm outside the body.

The technique involves monitoring and stimulating a woman's ovulatory process, removing eggs from the ovaries and letting sperm fertilise them in a laboratory.

The fertilised egg is then cultured for two to six days before being transferred to the patient's uterus.

Robert G. Edwards, the physiologist who developed the treatment, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010.The term test tube babies is used colloquially to refer to IVF children. It refers to the tube-shaped containers commonly used in chemistry labs and biology labs. IVF is usually performed in shallower containers called Petri dishes, however.

'With all the media attention, she would sometimes say it was as though I wasn't her baby. But she was brilliant, she did everything a mother could do and I try to follow her example.

'She was always there, a good listener. She was quite strict as well and kept us on the right path. She just did her best.'

Both sisters conceived naturally, but she said she would have considered IVF had she not been able to.

'Although it doesn't work for everybody, you just do what you have to do,' she said.

The sisters planted the tree at the clinic in recognition of the role it played in making medical history and making two generations of their family possible.

The clinic's founders, Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards, are seen as the pioneers of IVF. Current medical director Dr Thomas Mathews said John and Lesley Brown were also pioneers.

'Lesley was one of the sweetest and most cheerful women I have ever met at Bourn Hall. She always had a smile on her face, and was a source of great inspiration to others. She and John were more than willing to share their previous experiences with others around them,' Dr Matthews said.

Bourn Hall continues to collaborate with the University of Cambridge and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Centre to develop the science behind IVF.
