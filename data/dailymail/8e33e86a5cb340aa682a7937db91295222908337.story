Well-wishers have far surpassed the fundraising goals of the family of a 12-year-old girl from Texas whose brain tumor surgery that caused her to become obese and leaving her with two options - surgery or death.

With the U.S. military, her family's insurance provider, unwilling to pay for the girl's $50,000 operation because 'she's too young,' her family turned to crowd funding and found success - to the tune of $76,000.

Alexis Shapiro is 4 foot 7 and weighs almost 200 pounds. Alexis feels like she is constantly starving due to the fact that her surgery to remove a benign tumor caused damage to her hypothalamus, instigating the development of hypothalamic obesity.

The young girl's family was afraid the appeal process would take longer than she had. A GoFundMe page asking for help was set up, and it was more successful than they ever could have hoped.

The 'Hope for Alexis' page received donations in excess of $76,000, a shock to her family.

'You all have shown her that dreams can come true and that the rude comments out in public can be ignored because she has so many people supporting her and rooting for her,' her family posted on the page. 'Thank you oh so very much!'

The family also expressed their gratitude during a Monday interview with NBC News.

'If nothing else, we have what’s required for the hospital,' Jenny Shapiro said. 'Alexis really likes it. I think she feels like people aren’t looking at her anymore and people are rooting for her.'

The girl's family was 'surprised and touched' by the outpouring of help, Ms Shapiro also said.

Dr. Thomas H. Inge, of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, told NBC he plans to 'move forward as quickly as we can' with the life-saving operation.

The good news came only after the ailing girl's pleas for help received international publicity.

She is currently on a restricted diet of 900 to 1,400 calories per day but despite controlling her food intake, she keep's gaining weight.

Remarkable: The family's cries for help raised more than they ever could have hoped, far exceeding their goal of $50,000

'Our reviewers have denied your request for Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass,' reads the rejection notice sent from TRICARE earlier this month.

Her parents and doctors had asked that TRICARE reconsider their decision in order to save Alexis' life.

NBC news reports that Alexis is gaining two pounds per week. She has been hospitalized for a kidney infection and she has developed type 2 diabetes and requires nightly insulin injections.

Her pediatric obesity doctor, Dr. Thomas H. Inge of Cincinnati, believes that surgery is the only way to keep the suffering girl from gaining more weight which could top 400 pounds.

Gastric bypass surgery will do more that destroy the weight, it can also tell her brain that she is not starving and she may be able to curb her painful appetite.

After her surgery, Alex's parents had to take extreme measures to keep their daughter from eating herself to death.

'She’s always hungry,' her father Ian Shapiro said. 'In the past, we’ve had to padlock the cupboard.'

Two years ago after developing Craniopharyngioma , a rare type of brain tumor that grows next to the pituitary gland, Alexis had surgery to have it removed.

More than half of children with this specific form of tumor experience similar post-operative symptoms to Alexis.

'I think it is disappointing that they cannot see the facts of this case,' said Inge, of the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.

'There is no evidence that doing nothing would be in this child’s best interests,' he continued.

According to a spokesperson for TRICARE said that gastric bypass and weight loss services are only covered of the patient is or over and has full bone growth.

'In general, our Managed Care Support Contractors are required to approve or deny coverage based on TRICARE policy,' spokesman Austin Camacho said in an email to NBC News. 'We have an appeals process in place specifically designed to give our medical professionals the opportunity to examine the details of any special cases when coverage is denied,' said the insurance company.

Alexis may be a child, but she wears a women's size 1x or 2x and she goes up a size every month. When asked by psycologists about how she is coping with her condition, she has told them she 'wants to die.'

If Alexis gets the surgery she may be able to lead a normal life again and keep off the weight

'She doesn’t have any friends or anything like that,'  her mother Jenny Shapiro said. 'It’s so sad, because she remembers what it was like before.'

Alexis is in constant pain and has begun homeschooling because she is afraid of going out in public.

Doctor's believe that if Alexis has Bypass surgery, she may have a chance of leading a normal life.

Kelsie Blackwell of Indianapolis, Indiana,21, had a successful bypass surgery when she was 18 that helped her lose 100 pounds after being diagnosed with hypothalamic obesity.

Unlike Alexis, Blackwell's surgery was covered by insurance.

Alexis' parents have begun to investigate other ways to raise money for their daughter's surgery. They created a Gofundme.com account to raise enough money to cover her daughter's lifelong health costs.

'These kids will literally eat themselves to death,' Jenny Shapiro said.

'That’s what I’m scared of.'
