Universities minister Greg Clark said student fees were a 'phenomenal investment'

A Tory minister has insisted £9,000-a-year tuition fees are not too expensive – because it only costs the same as a 'posh coffee' to pay them back every day.

Universities Minister Greg Clark said if graduates earn £30,000 a year they have to pay back £2.22 a day, which he claimed was a 'phenomenal investment'.

Labour said the Cambridge-graduate's 'bizarre' remarks showed the Government was out of touch with public concern over the cost of university.

The Coalition increased the cap on student fees from £3,000 to £9,000 a year to fill the hole in university funding left by cuts to the higher education budget.

But, because student debts are written off after 30 years, just under half the money will never be recouped, meaning the scheme will cost the government £2.5billion a year more than ministers claimed, House of Commons library figures show.

At the same time average graduate debts have doubled from £20,000 in 2010 to £43,500.

Labour's wants to reduce the cap on fees to £6,000 a year before scrapping the system altogether and replacing it with a 'graduate tax' on earnings.

But Mr Clark, who attended his local comprehensive in Middlesbrough before making his fortune in business after graduating with a PHD in economics, said student fees were good value for money.

The Conservative minister, speaking at a science and engineering debate at the Royal Society last month, said: 'First of all it is important that we don't distract from the fact that for students under the system that we have, if you have a great education you only pay back if you're earning over £21,000 and only 9 per cent of your earnings above that.

'What that means is if you earn £30,000 as a graduate you bay back £2.22 a day, now there are people who buy cups of posh coffee for less than that, and I think people recognise that that is a phenomenal investment, it's not just a good investment for the student, but actually it's a good investment for the taxpayer.'

Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna attacked the remarks.

He told MailOnline: 'These bizarre remarks from Universities Minister Greg Clark show just how out of touch Tory ministers are on the huge costs and debts now facing students.

'They demonstrate a deeply dismissive attitude towards the real concerns which students and parents have on the cost of a degree.

'The Tory-led government trebled fees, cut funding for universities and saddled both students and the taxpayer with a mountain of debt, and we have recently learned that the average student debt now stands at £43,500 – more than double what it was under the old system.'

Starbucks coffees can cost more than £3 each 

At Waterloo station, just over the river from the House of Commons, a posh coffee costs considerably more than £2.22.

A ‘grande’ – or medium – Caramel Machiato will set coffee lovers back £3.40. This works out at £1,241 a year.

Over 30 years, which is the amount of time graduates are expected to repay their student loans, a daily Machiato hit will cost £37,230.

But this is still below the average £43,500 debt currently being racked up by students. 

Mr Umunna said a new graduate tax system would be 'fairer' than tuition fees and would be introduced 'in the medium term' if Labour returns to power.

The National Union of Students proposed an extra tax of between 0.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent of their income above £15,000, for a period of 20 years, with the highest earners paying higher rates.

Labour is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees to £6,000 a year.

Previously, Labour has suggested that it might pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks or with higher rates of interest for better-off students.

The party may also be forced to restrict the cut in fees to certain types of courses such as technical degrees, leaving other students to keep on paying the current cost.

Mr Umunna, who is responsible for higher education policy, said introducing a full-scale graduate tax 'as soon as possible is my priority'.

But Labour's plan to cut tuition fees to £6,000 a year has been criticised by university bosses, who claim it will inflict 'colossal damage' on the higher education sector.

Academics said the move could leave universities £10billion out of pocket and said it was 'implausible' that the government could step in to make up the difference given the state of the public finances.

In a letter to the Times, a group of university vice chancellors accused Labour of failing to understand that cutting fees will only benefit richer graduates – because under the present system, people only start paying back their loans once they earn more than £21,000 a year.

Student debts are also written off after 30 years.

The vice-chancellors said Mr Miliband's plans to lower tuition fees by £3,000 would leave £2billion a year out of pocket.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has been asked to find the money to fund Ed Miliband's pledge to cut tuition fees to £6,000 a year

They fear future Labour governments would be unable to find an extra £2 billion a year in the present financial climate.

Sir Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of the University of Surrey, said: 'This is purely a pragmatic issue, that a policy is evolving on the hoof which is not really a practical policy going forward and the potential damage is colossal:

'I really feel Labour has missed the point here. If you talk to students and to many mums and dads, the £9,000 [fee] is no longer the key topic.'

Simon Gaskell, president of Queen Mary University London, added: 'What our students tell us is that clearly the debts incurred through fees is important, but what would be a real game-changer for students, or what can defeat students, is the debt that arises from living expenses while they are at university.

'If money were to be spent to support the most needy students to go to university, subsidising fees is not the way to do it.'

But Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls claimed the current system of university financing would leave a 'huge looming charge' for taxpayers as many graduates fail to pay back the cost of their tuition.
