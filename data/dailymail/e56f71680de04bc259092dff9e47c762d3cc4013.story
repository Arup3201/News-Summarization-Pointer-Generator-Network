Manchester United are hopeful Wayne Rooney will be fit for this weekend’s derby after he appeared with a limp at a club sponsorship event on Monday.

Sources in the Rooney camp said the 29-year-old trained on Monday morning and was fully fit, despite appearing to carry his right leg gingerly at the launch of a new United deal with watch manufacturer Bulova in the afternoon.

Rooney has missed the last three United games through suspension after being sent off against West Ham and manager Louis van Gaal has been counting on him to return and lift the team at Manchester City on Sunday. 

Wayne Rooney joined the rest of his  United team-mates at the launch of the club's sponsorship with Bulova watches and he also wore a Matalan Alphabet scarf  in support of Alder Hey Children's Hospital Charity

United left back Luke Shaw described the news of Rooney's potential return as a 'massive boost'.

Shaw picked out United's 2-1 victory over City in 2011 as his favourite Manchester derby.

That day Rooney scored the most memorable goal of his career - an acrobatic overhead kick which sealed victory for United with 12 minutes left.

Shaw thinks Rooney will be itching to put on another match-winning display when he returns from suspension this weekend.

'It's a massive boost for us to have him back,' Shaw said.

Wayne Rooney joined a host of celebrities including Abbey Clancy, Dame Helen Mirren, Kylie Minogue, Keith Lemon, Mel B, Justin Bieber and Jessie J by wearing a Matalan Alphabet scarf for Alder Hey Children's Hospital Charity.

'It's something I think he's looking forward to. Wayne hates sitting on the sidelines watching.

'That goal (in 2011) was an unbelievable goal in a match that big. It was something special.'

Meanwhile, United defender Phil Jones was absent completely from the launch as he was having his latest injury assessed amid fears of another lay-off.

Van Gaal said on Sunday the England player had been suffering from shin splints.
