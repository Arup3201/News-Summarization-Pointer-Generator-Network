 A San Francisco man really went the distance on Sunday when he ran 8 miles in the shape of the words 'hire me' to get a job at a fitness tracking company.

Dan Miller hit the pavement in the city's SOMA neighborhood just before applying to Strava--whose app lets you map out your runs and bike rides.

'Hire me': Dan Miller ran a convoluted 8 miles in San Francisco's SOMA neighborhood to spell the words 'hire me' in the hope of snagged a job with the company whose app allows him to track the route

Catchy: Dan Miller has started mulitple successful internet businesses, so when he decided he wanted to work for Strava, he knew he had to make a splash

'I'm at a point in my career where I'm looking for an awesome company to work with,' Miller told ABC News. 'I'm so passionate about running already. It seemed like a good idea.'

There's no word yet on whether Miller's good idea worked, however. A spokesperson at Strava declined to comment on the hiring.

Strava allows people to use a smartphone to track their athletic activity and then view the route they have taken on a map.

It has spawned a new craze, as cyclists and runners create their own artwork with the red route line.

Examples of Strava art include a giant cat and the logo of the San Francisco 49ers.

Another cyclist, Bret Lobree, spent four hours drawing a huge turkey around a 53mile route in California for Thanksgiving.

Strava, MapMyRide and various other so-called 'cyclist apps' work on a very similar basis.

Their point? To allow riders to record their activity on a range of compatible GPS devices, including iPhone, Android, some fitness watches and Google Glass.

The kind of data they can record include the distance and where the cyclist has been on a detailed map - pinpointing exactly where the rider has been from start to end.

Calories burned, duration, speed, elevation and pace are also among the features it can track.

Some even give suggested routes, uploaded by other users.

Cyclists can then browse, analyse and compare their efforts with previous ones as well as other users and challenge themselves to do better. Their results can also be shared with friends and ranked on a leaderboard.
