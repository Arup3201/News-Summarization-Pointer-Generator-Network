The boyfriend of a young mother who was found stabbed to death at her home has been charged with murdering her.

Liam King, 25, appeared before magistrates today after police discovered the body of Rebecca Ayres - who had a three-year-old son - at her home in Salford, Greater Manchester.

A post-mortem found the 24-year-old known as Becks and Becky died of multiple stab wounds.

According to one of Becky's friends she was about to end her relationship with Mr King (left) after the christening of her three-year-old son Riley this Sunday

The couple had been in the same year at school but didn't begin a relationship until September 2012

Police were called to her home on 
Thursday morning following reports of concern for her welfare, a force spokesman said.

King, also from Salford, appeared at Manchester City 
Magistrates' Court today charged with the murder. He remains in custody.

In an emotional tribute Miss Ayres' family described her as a 'doting mum'.

'Becks was our hard-working, ambitious and fun-loving princess who lived life to the full,' they said.

'She had a smile that would light up any room and the hearts of everyone she came into contact with.

'She
 was a special daughter, granddaughter, sister, cousin, aunty and friend
 to many. She was a doting mum to her three-year-old son, who was her 
life.

'This has had a 
devastating impact on us all, including the community in which she 
lived, especially the Monaco Morris Dancing Troupe, of which she was a 
member from a very early age.'

Becky and Mr King were in the same year group at Wentworth High School and struck up a relationship in 2012

To friends in the area they added: 'On
 behalf of her family and friends, we would like to thank you for all 
the messages of support, tributes and condolences received and take 
comfort in the amount of support shown.

'Life will never be the same and it is unfair that we have to go on without her in our lives.'

A friend said Becky was due to have her son Riley christened tomorrow and had talked about ending the relationship.

The friend said: 'Its such a tragedy, Becky was a devoted mother to 
Riley and a lovely friends. We were all heartbroken.

'Riley was due to be
 Christened on Sunday but we heard Becky had been unhappy in her 
relationship with Liam.

'He doted on the little the boy but things 
weren't working out between Liam and Becky. It's possible that the fact 
they were living together meant they were getting under each other's 
feet.

Police were reportedly called to the couple's home after a male relative was unable to get a response

'We believe she wanted out and was planning to end their 
relationship after the Christening. Everyone's devastated - the real 
tragedy is her little boy who will now be without his mother.'

Becky
 and Mr King were in the same year group at Wentworth High School in 
Eccles, Greater Manchester, and began their relationship in late 2012.

Becky's son Riley was not at home at the time and had been staying with a relative

Police were called at about 9.15am on Thursday to her 
terraced home after a male relative reportedly raised the alarm when he could get no response from the property.

Neighbours also reported hearing screams and shouts coming from the house.

Chief Superintendent Mary Doyle of Greater Manchester Police said: 'A woman has been killed and our thoughts 
are with her family and friends at what is obviously a totally 
devastating time for them.

'I would like to reassure residents that 
we do not believe there is any danger to the community, we believe this 
is an isolated incident and are not looking for anyone else in 
connection with her death.

'We have a team of highly skilled 
detectives already working on this case but if anyone has any 
information they think can assist please call us.'

Tributes from friends of Miss Ayres flooded in from friends and social media users.

Close friend Lee Blackman, 24, who used to live with Becky, said: 'I feel sick, this can’t be real. She was a beautiful person.

'I’m truly shocked at the moment, I’m numb. We used to work together and rented a flat.

'She was a lovely girl and will be sorely missed.

'She had a son Riley, my heart goes out to him.'

Floral tributes were left outside the home where Becky was found murdered

Natalie Cadogan Leigh wrote: 'God bless you Becky taken away so early in life.

'My heart goes out to your family and friends at this most difficult thing they have ever imagined.

'Salford has lost another Beautiful Lady and you are truly honored and will not pass in vain. God bless.'

Riley was not in the property at the time of Miss Ayres' death and was on a sleepover with relatives.

Friends of the boy's father, who is in the armed forces, said they had been left ‘gutted’ by the loss of a ‘wonderful girl’.
