CEO Mary Barras has outlined a campaign to help GM move on from a troubled 2014 and reamain America's number one automaker

General Motors is recalling more than 117,000 cars and trucks in North America for a defect that could cause the vehicles to stall.

The automaker said it is unaware of any crashes, injuries or deaths related to the defect. 

Some 117,651 vehicles have been recalled, but the company estimates only roughly 1 per cent of the recalled vehicles suffer from the problem.

The issue involves the the chassis control module, which is a part of the vehicle's electronics system linked to the braking, steering, and suspension.

The defect can cause the chassis to be short-circuited by small metal fragments, potentially causing the car or truck to stall.

GM's announcement yesterday is the latest in a series of blows to the US's largest automaker's reputation.

In 2014, GM has recalled an unprecedented number of vehicles, after disclosing a fatal ignition switch flaw that went unreported for a decade.

On February 13, it announced the recall of more than 780,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s (model years 2005-2007). 

Two weeks later it added 842,000 Ion compacts (2003-2007), and Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars (2006-2007). All of the recalled cars have the same ignition switches.

According to CBS News, at least 23 people have been killed in crashes linked to faulty ignition switches.

GM said the ignition switches can wear from heavy, dangling keys. If the key chains are bumped or people drive on rough surfaces, the switches can suddenly change from the 'run' position to 'accessory' or 'off'.

In 2014, GM has recalled an unprecedented number of vehicles. Without counting the results of yesterday's announcement, the automaker has recalled 29.4 million cars and trucks this year

This cuts off power-assisted steering and brakes and can cause drivers to lose control. The air bags also may not inflate in a crash and protect the driver and passengers.

GM is urging people not to put anything on their key rings until the switches are replaced. 

The latest recall involves:

The company has admitted knowing about the problem switches for at least 11 years, despite not recalling the vehicles until this year. 

It scrutinized its older vehicles for the fault and announced more than 60 recalls.

Without counting the results of yesterday's announcement, the automaker has recalled 29.4 million vehicles so far in 2014.

The news of the most recent recall comes after top executive of GM outlined the company's campaign to ensure the automaker stays at the top.

CEO Mary Barras said: 'In the nine months that this leadership team has been together, we have spent a significant amount of time setting our goals for the future of GM and developing a specific action plan,'

'Our strategic plan is a pathway to earn customers for life and create significant shareholder value in the process,' she added.

'Every chance to connect with a customer is an opportunity to build a stronger relationship.'
