Clive Palmer's beloved dinosaur Jeff has been destroyed in a fire at his Coolum Resort.

A fire crew arrived the Sunshine Coast dinosaur park on Tuesday at 1.40am after reports the nine-metre mechanical lizard was ablaze.

The Palmer United Party leader confirmed that Jeff is now extinct and that the 'cause of death' was due to an electrical fault. 

Initially, police had investigated if the fire was intentionally lit.

'Jeff the dinosaur's body has been burnt out,' a spokesman for Mr Palmer confirmed.

'The fire department and police are completing their inspections this morning and the area is cordoned off to prevent access.

'Jeff will be dismantled and taken away once we have received clearance from the fire and police Departments.' 

He was apparently too devastated to comment further when personally contacted by the Sunshine Coast Daily.

Crews extinguished the fire in 20 minutes but were unable to save the dinosaur, which was 95% destroyed. The dinosaur's skeleton, a metal frame, is all that remains.

The resort is the largest dinosaur park in the world with more than 150 specimens on display. 

Chinese-import Jeff was the pinnacle of the display with moving limbs and simulated breathing and growling.

It weighed in at around 1.7 tonnes and is 20 metres in length. 

Mr Palmer allegedly named the mechanical giant after Queensland's former deputy premier, Jeff Seeney following a disagreement.  

Mr Seeney was contacted by Daily Mail Australia for comment following the death of his namesake.
