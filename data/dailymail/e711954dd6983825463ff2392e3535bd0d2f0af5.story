'Honeytrap': British professor Paul Frampton

A British scientist is being held in an Argentine jail on suspicion of smuggling cocaine.

Professor Paul Frampton, an Oxford graduate, was stopped at an airport in Buenos Aires as he tried to board a plane after police discovered two kilos of the drug in a suitcase.

Last night the professor, a former member of the UK Institute of Physics, was facing the nightmare prospect of a 16-year jail sentence if convicted.

The scientist, who is 68 and divorced, is said to have told investigators the drugs were planted in the suitcase without his knowledge in a honeytrap sting involving a model he met on the internet.

Reports say he claims he flew to Argentina to see his online girlfriend but ended up not meeting her.

Instead, a woman purporting to be her agent persuaded him to take the suitcase with him on the understanding that it belonged to the model.

He was arrested on January 23 at Ezieza International Airport moments before he boarded a plane to Peru for a second flight to the States. The drugs were in the lining of the suitcase.

He has spent the past two months in Villa Devoto Prison in Buenos Aires, scene of the worst jail riots in Argentine history in 1978 which left 62 people dead.

Professor Frampton, who was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, now lives in the United States and teaches physics at the University of North Carolina.

He has protested his innocence, saying: ‘I will not be convicted. There is easily enough evidence that I didn’t know there were drugs in the bag, and that will come out.’

But investigators say it is ‘improbable’ that a 68-year-old man ‘with a solid university education’ would agree to carry a suitcase for someone he had not met.

Friends are now trying to get him freed from prison while the investigation continues. Ex-colleague David Stallard said: ‘He never showed any interest in drugs and it is inconceivable to me that he intentionally smuggled cocaine. He must have been duped.’

Retired lawyer John Bird, a former neighbour, said: ‘There’s no one in the world more improbable who would smuggle cocaine. He got set up. I would bet my life on it.’
