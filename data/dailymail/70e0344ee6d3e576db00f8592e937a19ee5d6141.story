Football star Peter Crouch has clocked up nine points on his licence in a month after being caught speeding twice in the space of a month.

The former England international has been fined £1,000 for driving nearly 20mp over the speed limit in Macclesfield, Cheshire, last November.

Crouch, 31, who lives in nearby Mottram St Andrew, was also given five penalty points when he was spotted driving at 49mph in a 30mph zone.

The 6ft 7in striker had already been hit with four points earlier this month for another speeding offence.

The Stoke City star was driving a Land Rover at the time of the latest incident.

He was due to plead not guilty to speeding at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court yesterday, but changed his plea to guilty.

A second charge of failing to provide information on the identity of the driver was dropped.

Crouch, who didn’t appear in court, was ordered to pay £350 costs and a £15 victim surcharge for speeding at around 8.05pm on November 19.

Barry Warburton, defending, said: 'It was a Saturday evening in November and there was no traffic on the road whatsoever.

'He has accepted his guilt and his punishment should be at the bottom end of the scale.

'My client clearly has a disposable income and I will make sure he pays the fine immediately.'

Crouch had the four previous points put on his licence this month during a hearing at Stoke magistrates court.
