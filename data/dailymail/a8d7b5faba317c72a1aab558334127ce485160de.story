The extreme sports enthusiast completed his first base jump from the West Gate Bridge in his hometown of Melbourne Australia in 1997 and has been hooked ever since.

He said he films his jumps to remember his experience and help him improve on his technique.

This particular footage was captured on a 1600metre jump in France.

Mr McDougall said: 'I was a surfer, skateboarder and then I just went to do one skydive and that skydive changed my life forever, I then did my first basejump and have never looked back.

Mr McDougall - who has also been a surfer and a skateboarder - captured this particular footage on a 1600 metre jump in France. He said one skydive changed his life forever

Mr McDougall said that as this jump was quite technical, he 'stayed quite high' for the wing suit base jump

'What I love about basejumping is the friendships, the exotic locations and being responsible for your own destiny and the freedom.

'With every single jump I do, I am super scared but fear is your friend in this sport if you use it correctly.

'This particular jump was in France, it was my first time on this jump, it is quite technical that is why I stayed so high off the ground so I could check everything out.

'It is a very beautiful place, the jump went perfect and I was very happy.

'I film most of my jumps, it provides memories and it is a learning tool to get better at the sport.'
