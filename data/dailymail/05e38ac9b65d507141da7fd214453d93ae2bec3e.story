A teenage show jumper died in a freak accident after she was head-butted by her own horse during a competition, an inquest heard.

A-Level student Ella Pallister was knocked unconscious when her horse refused to jump a fence and 'pecked', suddenly lifting its head and striking her in the face.

She then fell off the back of the animal, named Cocoon II, and apparently hit her head on the jump.

Accident: Ella Pallister died when she was struck in the head by her horse Cocoon II during a competition

Hobby: The teenager was a keen show jumper who hoped to compete in the Olympics one day

As her leg was still stuck in the stirrup, she was dragged along the ground by her beloved horse for a short while.

Ella, 17, was rushed to hospital after the horrific accident at the Kingston Maurward Equestrian Centre in Dorchester, Dorset on January 27, and was later transferred to a specialist unit at Southampton Hospital.

However, doctors were unable to save her and she died three days later.

Hayley Greening of Dorset Police conducted an investigation into the accident, which took place in the practice arena during a show-jumping contest.

She told the inquest in Dorchester yesterday that the teenager had jumped over the practice fences multiple times and was about to take part in the competition itself.

'In my view Ella was a keen and talented rider,' Ms Greening said. 'It seems the horse refused the jump. The horse's head went down low, pulling Ella forward out of the saddle.'

The animal then 'pecked, whereby it lifted its head up and backwards suddenly, striking Ella's forehead'.

The officer continued: 'She fell in an unusual position and her left foot stuck in the stirrup, which would have been unlikely had she been responsive.

'The horse stood still before walking, trotting and cantering a short distance. The way she was dragged suggested to me she was not responsive.

'The horse then kicked out, Ella's foot came out of the stirrup and she lay on the ground. This was a tragic and unavoidable accident.'

Missed: Ella's father said he and her mother were 'very proud of her' and 'miss her very badly'

Dorset coroner Sheriff Payne recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying: 'In this case, as always, it is tragic that a young girl her age came to grief following a sport she loved.'

After the inquest, Ella's father Ted Pallister said: 'Her mum and I were very proud of her, we miss her very badly.

'I would hope this is something that never happens to anyone else.'

Ella had been studying for business studies and PE A-Levels at school, as well as for a BTEC National Diploma in Animal Science at Kingston Maurwood College.

She was part of the Thomas Hardy School horse riding team which recently competed at the National School Equestrian Association's national showjumping finals, and hoped to compete at the Olympics one day.

Ella lived with her parents - who run an indoor riding school - and her younger sister in the village of Portesham, near Weymouth.
