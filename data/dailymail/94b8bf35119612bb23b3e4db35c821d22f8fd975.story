Manchester United have sold all 55,000 season tickets in record time ahead of Louis van Gaal’s arrival in England this week.

Van Gaal’s exploits in taking Holland to the World Cup semi-finals in Brazil has fired a surge of interest among United fans and a message on the official club website last night confirmed that season tickets are now sold out for 2014/15.

It is the earliest United have reached this point since the stadium was expanded to 76,000 fans in 2006. The remaining 21,000 seats are held back for away fans and supporters who want to attend individual matches.

The news of an upturn in ticket sales 
will be a huge boost and relief to United who are expecting to unveil 
van Gaal to the world’s media at Old Trafford on Thursday before they 
depart for their pre-season American tour.

After last season’s disappointing 
seventh-place finish under David Moyes which meant the club will not be 
involved in Europe, they wrote to their eight thousand corporate-seat 
holders agreeing to reduce prices by 15%.

Unlike season-ticket holders, corporate tickets are used for cup matches as well.

Whereas Moyes wanted to give all 
United’s players a chance to prove themselves last summer, van Gaal is 
expected to make quick decisions about who he wants to stay.

Patrice Evra is close to completing a £1million move to Juventus after the club agreed to his request to go to Italy with the player’s wife Sandra keen to move.

The club may also be willing to listen to offers for Wilfried Zaha, Bebe, Anderson, Marouane Fellaini, Danny Welbeck and Javier Hernandez.

Van Gaal has already signed £30million left-back Luke Shaw and holding midfield player Ander Herrera and is keen to add a left-back, centre-half and two midfielders.

Daley Blind and Wesley Sneijder from Holland’s World Cup squad are targets and the manager is a confirmed fan of Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal who played for Chile in this summer’s tournament.
