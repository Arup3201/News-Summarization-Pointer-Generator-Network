When Caroline Wozniacki’s world came crashing down in May, her wedding plans suddenly and very publicly cancelled, she knew who she could turn to.

Beyond her immediate family, one of the first people she called was Serena Williams, asking if she fancied to spend some party time together on Miami’s South Beach to help try and regroup after the shock.

Serena, who was also going through a turbulent time with her coach/boyfriend Patrick Mouratoglou, agreed and the pair seemed to be content to be photographed hanging out together.

Friendship: Serena Williams was there for Caroline Wozniacki after her split from Rory McIlroy

Shelved: While close off the court, all bets will be off when Wozniacki and Williams meet in the US Open final

Barely three months after offering mutual support they will on Sunday night contest the final of the US Open, with both pledging their friendship will be set aside as Wozniacki goes for her first Grand Slam title and Williams her 18th.

The appearance in the final of the two means that eight different women have featured in the climaxes to the Major events in 2014.

Billie Jean King, godmother of professional women’s tennis, sees this as a sign of the game’s health but is clear that she thinks Williams is about to end her barren spell in the Slams this season.

Not only that, she also believes that, even approaching 33, the world No1 will one day pass Steffi Graf’s mark of 22 Major titles — she stands now on 17 and would equal Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert with victory.

‘Serena is the one to beat, she should win if she plays well. The main difference is her serve, although Caroline is doing a better job on her serve than she was, actually the biggest weakness in women’s tennis right now is the serve,' King says.

Good humour: Wozniacki impersonates Williams at a charity match and the pair on holiday in Miami

‘I think Serena will end up with many more than 18 — and 22, I can imagine her doing that. It’s up to her, whether she is willing to pay the price. I played until I was 40. She is a phenomenal athlete and gets a lot of free points on her serve.’

Frankly it will not say much for the depth in women’s tennis if Williams does get to 23 sometime in her mid-thirties. Like everyone, King, a remarkably strong character herself, much admires the way Wozniacki has bounced back from personal trauma this summer.

‘I think it’s very character revealing after the break up with Rory McIlroy what she has done. Taking up the [New York] marathon as well and doing it for charity. It shows how strong she really is.

Going for it: Williams is playing for her 18th Grand Slam title on Sunday

Unfinished business: Although Wozniacki's been No 1 in the world, she's yet to win a major title

‘They have both done well in their careers but I think Caroline is one of the greatest of people, she is very respectful and I take my hat off to her how she has handled everything.

‘In the final she has to go to the net when she can. She’s very good at defence so she has to maintain that and her serve has to hold up.’

It is the most fascinating backdrop to a women’s final in years, with one great champion trying to salvage what has been a difficult and deflating season, featuring dramas such as her dazed behaviour at Wimbledon.

The challenger is being driven by something more than the desire to win, perhaps as McIlroy was when he went on his tear through the Majors.

Europeans do not always get much support when tackling an American at Flushing Meadows, but even the most stone hearted New Yorker would struggle not to be somewhat torn about this.

Billie Jean King will join Sir Elton John to stage Mylan World Team Tennis Smash Hits on finals day of the Statoil Masters Tennis tournament at the Royal Albert Hall on 7th December. The event, which will benefit the Elton John AIDS Foundation, will feature John McEnroe, Tim Henman and Kim Clijsters. For tickets visit www.statoilmasterstennis.com or call 0207 070 4404
