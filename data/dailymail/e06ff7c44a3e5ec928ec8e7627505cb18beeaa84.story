The victim of a vicious kidnapping and torture is speaking out for the first time about the ordeal, revealing his struggle as he was handcuffed and beaten for hours over the weekend.

Police say that Thomas Chapman’s six roommates turned on him on Saturday evening, torturing him in the basement of their Magna, Utah, home, binding his feet, stapling his lips shut and jabbing at his chest with a power tool.

Speaking to KSL TV today, Chapman chronicled the agonising hours, saying he was punched and kicked by his attackers, but that was only the beginning.

Brutality: Thomas Chapman said he was viciously beaten by his six roommates, had his lips stapled and was cut with a power tool during the assault, which lasted hours

Wounds: Chapman shows where his assailants poked at him with a drill

He told the station: 'They put my hands behind my back and stuff and handcuffed me with my own handcuffs.

'Next thing I know I’m getting beat up with my laptop, keyboards, boards, sticks, having knives put to my throat, getting kicked in the ribs, getting kicked in the head.'

Chapman also had his lips, ears and chest stapled and his assailants poked at him with a Dremel drill, all while he was held at gunpoint.

Jennifer Moses, 30, Lee Carl Moses, 26, David Masters, 55, Paula Masters, 43,  Brandon Haggard, 20 and 45-year-old Tracy Jordan allegedly kidnapped the man late on Saturday evening.

The suspects were reportedly suspicious about Chapman, 41, who only moved into the house in Magna, near Salt Lake City, 11 days ago.

The roommates struck him multiple times with objects including a crutch, keyboard, laptop and the butt of a shotgun.

Unified Police Lt. Justin Hoyal said : 'All night they tortured him. One of the suspect's claims over the last several weeks different people have pulled a gun on him in the street. They believe [the victim] was responsible for it.'

The group decided at 4am on Sunday that the roommate might not have been behind the threats and apologised before letting him go, Officer Hoyal said.

They released Chapman, who fled to a relative's home wearing only underpants and was taken to a hospital. He remains in a stable but serious condition after his ordeal.

The six were booked into the Salt Lake County Jail on charges of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated assault and obstruction of justice.

Records showed all suspects remained in custody today. It was unclear whether they have attorneys.

Chapman had agreed to remodel the basement instead of paying rent at the shared home. The relationship between those living at the residence was unclear.
