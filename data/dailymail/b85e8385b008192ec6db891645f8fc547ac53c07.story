It seems there is always time to have a little fun even if it is in the middle of a civil war.

A video has emerged of a Syrian rebel mocking a loyalist sniper by teasing it with a puppet. 

The puppet is made by covering a spade with a balaclava and black jacket.

The soldiers, believed to be from Uzbekistan, appear to be cornered by the sniper and are fighting for the opposition in Syria.

However, they are seen in footage laughing hysterically and joking as one of them holds the shovel and provokes the sniper by repeatedly making it appear from around the corner of a wall.

The sniper can be heard firing gun shots at it. 

The footage, which has appeared on YouTube, has gone viral with more than 1.4 million views.
