On any other stretch of water it probably wouldn’t garner a second glance. But this is monster territory.

Footage of a shadowy figure briefly emerging from the depths of Loch Ness has once again fuelled speculation that its legendary resident is alive and well.

Grainy footage has emerged showing a long and thin shape swaying in the water that bears a striking resemblance to Nessie’s fabled slender neck.

Richard Collis appears to have captured footage of Nessie's head and neck emerging from Loch Ness 

The video shows the object waving in the choppy water, around 500ft from the loch’s shore.

It was captured by Richard Collis – who counts himself amongst the most ardent Nessie cynics after years of fishing on the waters without a sighting.

But the tree planter was so taken aback by the mysterious shape he noticed while driving along the edge of the loch that he filmed it on his iPhone, and believes he might have stumbled upon the real deal. 

‘As I was watching, I was thinking what the hell is that?’ said Mr Collis, 58, who noticed the shape while travelling around a mile from Fort Augustus at the south-west end of Loch Ness.

He added: ‘I don’t really believe in anything like that until I see it.

‘I’m not saying it was a fire breathing dragon and I never saw teeth or anything like that, but I must have thought there was something there if I stopped to take pictures.’

Mr Collis said he thought the figure in the water was about 500ft away from the shore in the choppy waters 

The footage, lasting two minutes in total, was taken last Thursday.

Mr Collis’s wife Vibeke, 60, added: ‘I’ve been here 37 years and my husband has been here his whole life, so we are completely aware of how unique this is. I couldn’t believe it and laughed when he showed me because I knew he could never set that up. He’s not very technical.’

The image will now join hundreds of other possible sightings that have amassed over the years, some of which have been confirmed to be fakes. Only last week, paranormal investigator Jonathan Bright published an image taken three years ago appearing to show the head of a monster in the loch.

But despite decades of speculation, the mysterious creature has so far proved little more than a myth.

The video footage appears to be the latest sighting of the monster, since it was first spotted 1,500 years ago

In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app.

The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is ‘likely’ to be the elusive beast.

An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com

Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathon's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.'

Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged.

In 2001 semi-retired photographer James Gray and friend Peter Levings took this while they were out fishing
