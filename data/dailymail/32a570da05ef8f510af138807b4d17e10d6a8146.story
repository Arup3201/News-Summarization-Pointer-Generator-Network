These horrifying pictures show how a cyclist was hurled ten feet into the air after being struck by a motorist who then drove off,.

Patrick Knetemann, 34, suffered broken discs in his neck and severe bruising after he was hit head-on by the VW Golf as he cycled along a main road in Slough, Berkshire, last month.

A video camera mounted on his bike's handlebars captured the terrifying incident and the footage has been passed to Thames Valley Police officers who are investigating.

Mr Knetemann, from Kensington, west London, had gone to Slough for an afternoon's cycling when he was hit by the black car as it crossed the road in front of him.

He was thrown from his saddle and into the car windscreen, which shattered with the force of the impact, and left him lying, injured, in the gutter, but the motorist still sped off.

A bullet cam on his handlebars continued filming as the bike spun wildly through the air and landed, broken in two, ten feet away behind the car.

The crash completely sheered off the front forks and wheel of the experienced cyclist's £1,000 red BMC road bike.

A passing off-duty paramedic came to Mr Knetemann's aid and he was rushed to nearby Wexham Park Hospital, where he spent two days being treated for fractures to two cervical discs in his neck and bruising to his upper body.

Mr Knetemann said: 'He came out of nowhere. The impact was so quick I had no time to stop.

'I hit the windscreen with my shoulder and it shattered straight away - that shows how fast and hard he hit me.

'I think he was turning right to go into the Kwik Fit garage and didn't see me.  But I had a light on my bike, and I was wearing a bright red helmet.

'After one or two seconds he sped off, leaving my there on the pavement.'

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'We are investigating the incident on June 14 on Langley Park Road.'

Anyone with any information is asked to contact the police by calling 101.
