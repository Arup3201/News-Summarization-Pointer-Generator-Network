Charged: Convicted sex offender Kathy Perkins has been accused of kidnapping her stepchildren

A Washington state sex offender has been accused of kidnapping her step-children and trying to disguise them as she started a new life with her boyfriend.

Kathy Kay Perkins, who is on the sex offenders' register, was charged earlier this month with kidnap, after a school contacted police with concerns about some new students.

Perkins allegedly dyed the hair of ex-husband's children and tried to enroll them at an elementary school using new names.

A counselor at Hazelwood Elementary School contacted police in Auburn last October, after becoming suspicious of Perkins.

The 42-year-old is accused of taking the young girls from their Oregon home in March or April last year.

She took them to California, where she told a court she was their mother and that she was filing a restraining order against the children's father, according to court papers seen by Seattle PI.

Her stepdaughters were enrolled at a school in California under fake names, but Perkins is accused of fleeing with them again when police started to investigate.

During the time the children were away from their father, Perkins was using the surname of the new man she was dating.

She is accused of trying to convince the children that she was their real mother, and their father was not biologically related to them.

'The girls would later disclose in an 
interview that Kathy had told them multiple times that she was their 
true mother and [their father] was not their real dad,' a detective 
said in charging papers.

Perkins, who had been ordered to sign the sex offenders' register over an indecent liberties charge from 2004, used several aliases, including the surnames Brown, Hall, Fox, Woods, and Johnson, as well as the name Rios Hall.

She was already wanted for failing to register as a sex offender and now faces two counts of custodial interference.
