Soil from the First World War battlefields of Flanders was today blessed and added to a memorial garden which will mark next year's 100th anniversary of the start of the conflict.

Seventy bags arrived in London yesterday and were taken by gun carriage from HMS Belfast to Wellington Barracks, where the Flanders Field Memorial Garden is being created.

On the way the carriage passed national landmarks such as St Paul's Cathedral and Buckingham Palace.

Poignant: Sacred soil from the battlefields of Flanders was today carried through London after being unloaded from a Belgian frigate. It was drawn by six colour matched black Irish Draught horses to Wellington Barracks, near Buckingham Palace

Sacred: The soil arrived yesterday and will be used to create the Flanders Memorial Garden in central London

Mission: The bags wound their way through the streets of London during the symbolic journey towards the barracks

Each bag had the poppy symbol stitched into its fabric, as well as the dates 14-18, representing the timeline of the Great War. 20 was added to mark 2014, the year the new garden will open

The bags were delivered by the Belgian Navy frigate Louise-Marie, which sailed through Tower Bridge, opened fully in recognition of the event.

The frigate berthed alongside HMS Belfast, and the sandbags were 'cross-decked', or moved, to the quarterdeck of the British ship by Belgian naval ratings and members of Number 7 Company Coldstream Guards.

They were then loaded on to a gun carriage of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.

Respect: The horse-drawn carriages pass through through Horse Guards Parade on their way to the barracks

Never forget: Woollen poppies were stitched to the bags, which carried soil from WWI battlefields

Symbolic: Soldiers stand guard next to the sacred sacks after they arrive at their final destination

A casket, symbolically containing a crucible of soil from all the battlefields, waspiped ashore from HMS Belfast and placed with the bags on the carriage before departure.

The 1.5 ton carriage, drawn by six colour matched black Irish draught horses, crossed Tower Bridge and proceeded into the City of London, before ending at the barracks

There was a short ceremony in the presence of the Minister-President of Flanders, Kris Peeters, and Defence Minister Lord Astor, and the casket of soil was then placed in the garden by Patrick Casey, eight, from Barnet.Â

For the cause: The soil was gathered by 1,000 schoolchildren from Belgium and Britain during the summer

The garden, designed by Belgian architect Piet Blanckaert, will be opened officially on Remembrance Sunday 2014.

Lance Sergeant Michael Moran, No 7 Company Coldstream Guards, from South Shields, who helped to place the sandbags in their safe area on HMS Belfast, said yesterday: 'It was amazing and such a great honour to be involved in the ceremony today.

'This is a once in a lifetime event, and I found being part of it almost overwhelming.

Ceremonial: Earlier, the bags had arrived on the Belgian Frigate Louise Marie, which sailed underneath Tower Bridge on its way to HMS Belfast

Landmark moment: The new memorial garden will be ready for the public by the summer of 2014

'An event like this gives us all a sense of closure. I've done two operational tours of Afghanistan but what those soldiers went through in the First World War was far worse. Those were real men.

'When the garden is complete it will be a quiet place to go and pay respects to all those lost in the Great War fighting for our freedom.'
