Scotland's Dan Keatings put his London 2012 heartbreak behind him by winning Commonwealth gold on the pommel horse in Glasgow's SSE Hydro.

The 24-year-old produced a stunning routine in front of his home crowd to score 16.058 and see off the challenge of the returning Englishman Louis Smith and triple Commonwealth gold medal winner Max Whitlock.

Whitlock claimed the silver medal with a score of 15.966, while Smith took away bronze in his first major competition since the Olympics two years ago with a mark of 14.966.

Victory: Keatings' score of 16.058 was enough to hold off the English challenge from Smith and Whitlock

The highly anticipated final had been billed as a showdown between Olympic silver medallist and comeback king Smith, England and Great Britain's brightest new all-around star Whitlock and Scotland's Keatings, who has battled back from a series of injury setbacks to compete at his home Games after missing out on selection for the London Olympics.

Smith was not chosen for May's European Championships, where Whitlock saw off the challenge of Olympic pommel horse champion Krisztian Berkhi to claim gold after Keatings missed out on the showed by failing to qualify.

It meant, however, that the stage was set in Glasgow for a battle of Britain's best on the apparatus, with more than just pride at stake.

Canada's Anderson Loran opened the final with a steady routine, but one which lacked the difficulty for a place on the podium with Wales' Clinton Purnell also not hitting the heights required.

Keatings was up next and punched the air after he nailed a routine which achieved a huge score with a 7.200 difficulty rating to throw down the gauntlet to his opponents.

Wales' Jac Davies scored 14.800 before Smith took to the horse an pulled out all the stops with a slight hesitation before his dismount to move into silver medal position with 14.966.

Scotland's Dan Purvis went clean but his 14.516 placed him in fourth before it was Whitlock's turn on the apparatus.

The newly crowned Commonwealth floor and all-around champion produced a clean routine but, despite having a higher start score than Keatings - 7.4 - his execution was not judged to be as good, leaving the Scot to take the glory.

Next up was the women's bars final where England's Becky Downie won gold ahead of Australia's Larrissa Miller in silver while England's Ruby Harrold took bronze.

A fall ended the medal hopes of Wales' Elizabeth Beddoe but Downie hit her routine and was awarded a score of 14.666 to move into gold medal position at the early stage in the final.

Miller slotted in behind Downie with 14.566 before Canada's Black went into bronze medal position.

It meant Downie led at the halfway point and the Beijing Olympian held on as Wales' Rear Theaker came off to finish last in the rankings, with Harrold making a late charge to bronze with a score of 14.366.
