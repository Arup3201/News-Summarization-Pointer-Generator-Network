A bride-to-be has told how her fiancé was murdered by his friends who brutally beat him before setting his body alight on his stag night.

Mandy Hammond, 41, was left heartbroken after her husband-to-be Ramsey Raulinautis, 35, died three days after the brutal attack left him with horrific injuries and severe burns over 60 per cent of his body.

His friends, Polish-born Pawel Lysonik, 22, and Kamil Semrau, 28, were jailed for life after being convicted of his murder after a trial.

Two other men Lukas Kalkowski, 30, and 
Stanislaw Gliszczynski, 31, were found guilty of GBH with intent and 
sentenced to 17 years in prison.

Ms Hammond revealed how her fiance had gone out with friends to 'celebrate his last night of freedom' when his bachelor party turned violent and Mr Raulinautis ended up being badly beaten before his body was set on fire.

Ms Hammond had spent the evening having her nails painted and hair prepared for the wedding ceremony the following morning while her fiance was out enjoying himself.

But the police called in the early hours to say Ramsey was in a critical condition and four of his Polish friends had been arrested.

Ms Hammond said: 'When I heard their 
names my jaw dropped in disbelief - they were the friends he'd gone out 
with for his stag night.

'Ramsey had invited them around for dinner in the past - I had welcomed them into our home and cooked a meal for them.

'I still don't know what happened that night and why they killed my husband-to-be.'

Miss Hammond became concerned when her fiance didn't answer his phone while on his stag night.

She heard a knock at the door in the early hours and ran to answer it, thinking her husband-to-be had come home.

But two police officers told her Mr Raulinautis had been viciously attack outside a hotel and his body then set on fire. He died in hospital three days later.

Ms Hammond said: 'I felt as if I'd been kicked in the stomach. I was asked to identify his body - when I got there I looked down at the man who I should have been saying my vows to.

'I had to steady myself against the wall to stop from collapsing, I could barely recognise him, he had horrific injuries and burns.

'I went home and took my wedding dress out of the wardrobe, I lay on the bed and looked at it as I had so many times before, but this time I was sobbing.'

Construction worker Ramsey moved to Newport, South Wales, where he met mother-of-seven Ms Hammond five years ago.

He later proposed on a trip to meet his family in his hometown in Lithuania. The couple came home and set their wedding day for 10 March, 2011.

Ms Hammond said: 'My wedding dress is still hanging in my wardrobe - I wish Ramsey could have seen me wear it.

'Everyday I think about the torment he endured, I will never get over losing him.

'I still have all his clothes, I can't bear to part with them. They still smell of him and it comforts me.'

The four men who were with Mr Raulinautis on the night of his death stood trial at Cardiff Crown Court last year.

Polish-born Pawel Lysonik, 22, and Kamil Semrau, 28, were found guilty by the jury of murder and jailed for life.

Lukas Kalkowski, 30, and Stanislaw Gliszczynski, 31, were found guilty of GBH with intent and sentenced to 17 years in prison.

Cardiff Crown Court heard the four men refused to give any explanation why they carried out the fatal attack on Ramsey.

Judge Justice Roderick Evans told the men: 'This was a shockingly violent, cold blooded murder and you caused your victim extreme suffering.

'He was given a ferocious beating but his body was then so badly burned many of the injuries were unable to be seen by a pathologist.

'You stuffed paper into his clothing and set him alight - even in his injured state he must have been in agony.'
