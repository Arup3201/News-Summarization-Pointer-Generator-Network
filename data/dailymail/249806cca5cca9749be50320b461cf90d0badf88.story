The UK's biggest rooftop solar plant - the size of two-and-a-half football pitches - has been unveiled.

Costing £4million, the 7,000 panels have been installed at the Promens plastics plant near Beccles, Suffolk.

With a capacity of 1.65MW, the panels produce enough energy to power 480 homes.

The UK's largest solar roof installation went live in time to 
beat a Government deadline next week to withdraw Feed-in Tariff funding for larger sized schemes. Adrian Banks, engineering manager at Promens, said: 'This is really another step along the path of commitment to reduce our impact on the environment and this is the most significant step Promens Beccles has done in the last 12 months.'

Almost all of the power produced from the sun's energy falling on the plant roof will be used on-site, with any surplus feeding into the national grid.

The scheme was paid for by hundreds of small investors from across the UK who contributed sums starting at £3,000.

They were brought together by fund manager Octopus to cash in on a Government subsidised scheme, that has now had its rules changed to allow individual households to benefit.

The installation was developed by Lightsource, a renewable energy installer and operator, and built by Grupotec, a Spanish engineering and architectural consultancy which specialises in green power generation.

Nicholas Boyle, chief executive of 
Lightsource, said: 'This roof-top solar plant highlights the important 
role solar generation has to play in our future energy mix, particularly
when the energy it produces is used at source, removing the need for 
wasteful distribution networks.'

'Getting
this site online before the August deadline was a considerable 
achievement and it is a real credit to Grupotec, for their speed and 
coordination during design and construction, and to Promens as a company
for their commitment to the project and a willingness to do what was 
needed to get it completed.'

Paul Latham, managing director of 
Octopus said: 'The Promens installation isn’t just a great achievement 
in its own right, but also a validation that Octopus can deliver to its 
investors what we said we would. Given the tight deadline set by the 
Government, we were one of very few investment houses able to provide 
funding for solar projects such as this one.

'However, none of it could have been 
done without the support from our investors, who recognised that solar 
offers a unique opportunity to benefit from Government-approved 
incentives by investing as little as £3,000.'

It
is the largest initiative of its kind to date and changes to Government
subsidies are expected to limit future developments on this scale.

Ministers
were becoming concerned that solar farm developers would drain the 
limited funds that are primarily intended for domestic rooftop 
installations.

The Government has dramatically reduced the subsidies available for any solar 
scheme over 50KW coming online after August 1, so it is likely that this 
will be the UK’s largest roof-top installation ever.
