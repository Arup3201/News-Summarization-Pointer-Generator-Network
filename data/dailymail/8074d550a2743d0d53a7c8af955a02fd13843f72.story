Shamed celebrity chef  Paula Deen continued to butter up fans for a comeback attempt on Wednesday as she announced plans for a subscription-only internet network.

Paula Deen Ventures, a new company formed to help launch a comeback for Deen, says the Paula Deen Network will launch in September and will be accessible by computer, smartphone or tablet.

‘You can throw out your TV, now,’ gushed the fallen Food Network star.

'You can throw away your TV, now': Deen announced last week that she'll be launching a digital cooking and entertainment network for subscribers only to stream on tablets, phones and home computers

Comeback: The Paula Deen Network will become available in September and become part of the fallen Food Network star's attempt at a comeback following her scandal over racist remarks that destroyed the 67-year-old's career last year

The network will feature daily programming in an unscripted format with new recipes, episodes and cooking tools.

‘We're going to have so much fun being together and cooking up some wonderful new and classic dishes,’ Deen said. ‘Y'all can get my recipes, tips and cooking anytime you want — this is for you. I can't wait to crank up the oven and get cooking for the people I love: my family, my friends and my fans!’

Production for the network began last month at a new studio in Savannah that has been designed to look like the set of her first television show, Paula's Home Cooking. The set was built to accommodate a live studio audience, and guest appearances are planned.

The announcement of the digital network is the latest step in a comeback strategy Deen kicked off in February when she announced a deal with the Najafi Companies, an Arizona-based private investment firm that's putting millions into rebooting her public career.

On Friday, the 67-year-old gave a sneak peek of her upcoming 20-city comeback speaking tour with an appearance at the opening of her Gatlinburg, Tennessee retail Paula Deen Store.

Fans were disappointed from the start, though. Deen made them wait hours outside for her to arrive and open the place.

Like old times? Production for the network began last month at a new studio in Savannah that has been designed to look like the set of her first television show, Paula's Home Cooking. Deen attracted over a million viewers to her Food Network show in 2012, but it remains to be seen how many will make the jump to digital after last year's racism scandal

'We're going to have so much fun being together and cooking up some wonderful new and classic dishes,' Deen said. 'Y'all can get my recipes, tips and cooking anytime you want - this is for you'

The 90-minute Paula Deen Live! show that
 features a mix of cooking demonstrations, games with audience members 
and personal stories. The shows in Piegon Forge, Tennessee, on June 21 
and 22 will feature a preview of the Paula Deen Network.

Members
 of the public will pay anywhere up to $211 for tickets and she will be 
joined by her husband Michael on stage at the start of the tour.

Wednesday's
 announcement comes about a year after a sworn statement by Deen that 
she had used racial slurs in the past became public. The Food Network 
and other corporate sponsors soon parted company with Deen.

To help promote her new network, Deen is embarking on a 20-city tour across the southern states starting in late June. She gave a sort of sneak peek of the speaking tour on Friday when she showed up for the opening of her Gatlinburg, Tennessee retail store
