Joe Marler hopes England will take their frustration out on Scotland in Saturday's RBS Six Nations clash at Twickenham.

Any hope of completing the Grand Slam evaporated with a comprehensive 19-9 defeat by Ireland, who are now the title favourites ahead of their trip to Cardiff.

England return to Twickenham for the final two rounds of the tournament against Scotland and France, and Marler has demanded they finish on a high.

'We definitely need to see a reaction after losing to Ireland and because of the levels of frustration and the edginess we've seen in training, I hope there will be one,' said the loosehead prop.

'Ireland was 10 days ago but there's still a massive amount of frustration from the boys and me personally.

'But we have an opportunity this weekend at home to deal with that frustration and look to try and put in a better performance.

'Scotland will have plenty of ambition and have some experienced guys in the forwards, so it will be a tough ask at the weekend.

'We're lucky to be back at Twickenham for the last two fixtures of the tournament. It's our home, we love playing there and the crowd are really behind us these days.

'I hope we can put in a performance we're proud of and that the fans will be proud of.'
