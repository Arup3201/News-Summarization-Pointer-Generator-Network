On a night when Mario Balotelli made headlines for the reasons Liverpool hoped he would after paying £16million for the striker in the summer, controversy was still not far from the Italian.

With just his second touch of the match Balotelli got on the end of a Fabio Borini cross to stab home the goal that levelled Liverpool with Swansea 1-1 with just four minutes left in regular time. 

It set up the match for a grandstand finish that saw Liverpool snatch victory from the hands of defeat as Dejan Lovren claimed the injury time winner with a header at the back post from a free-kick.

Yet still in his short time on the pitch after being brought on for Rickie Lambert in the 79th minute, he still managed to be at the centre of a blow-up with Swansea's Jonjo Shelvey.

Both formidable figures on the pitch, the Italian and the Englishman squared up, pointed, poked and had what appeared to be harsh words with each other on the pitch, and met again at the end of game. 

It was an encounter that required team-mates and officials to step in, with Jordan Henderson appearing to escort his team-mate from the pitch to help avoid any further dramas.

While not appearing to be a major incident, with Shelvey extending what seemed to be an olive branch with a handshake at the end, Balotelli continues to be a problem child for Reds boss Brendan Rodgers.

He offended fans and team-mates when he capped off a poor performance in the Champions League against Real Madrid by swapping shirts with Pepe in the tunnel as the pair left the pitch at half-time. Balotelli was subbed at the break by Rodgers, but was not impressed when told by the media of the shirt swap after the match.

Balotelli then attracted more unwanted attention amid claims he used 'threatening behaviour' against a woman trying to take pictures of his Ferrari. However, after investigating, police decided to take no further action.
