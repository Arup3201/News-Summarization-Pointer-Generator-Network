The California retreat where Frank Sinatra married his fourth wife and where guests, from the Queen of England to Clark Gable, have vacationed, is to host President Obama and the China's leader.

Sunnylands, a sprawling 200-acre pink-roofed estate in Rancho Mirage, will be the setting for a critical meeting as President Obama discusses cyber crime and North Korea with President Xi Jinping.

Built in 1966 by billionaire Walter Annenberg and his wife Leonora, the Sunnylands estate includes a 20,000 square foot main house, three cottages and a nine-hole golf course.

Desert retreat: Sunnylands in California was designed to reflect the pink hues of the sunset over the mountains

It is best known for its pink roof complete with pyramid, requested by Mrs Annenberg who wanted 'to match the sunset glow on nearby foothills'.

The Annenbergs liked the color of the roof so much that they used the same stone for the burial chamber where they were laid to rest, according to NBC News.

When the billionaire couple decided to build their country estate, they turned to A Quincy Jones, said to be the only true modernist architect in the U.S.

The long-time dean of the University of Southern California's School of Architecture, was renowned for his statement roofs and ability to blend modern architecture into landscapes.

At Sunnylands he added walls of glass to make the most of the natural light, overhangs to provide shade from the desert sun and Mexican stone lava walls.

'Traditionally, great estates have been built in historic styles,' Los Angeles architect Frederick Fisher said.

'So it was a bold move on the part of the Annenbergs to bring in a modernist architect to design Sunnylands, one of the great and arguably the only purely modernist estate in the United States.'

Jones's ultra-modern design was offset by 
Mrs Annenberg, who introduced a rose and cactus garden and Hollywood 
Regency style interiors.

She employed William Haines and Ted Graber, who had refurbished the White House under the Reagan administration, to work on the inside of their home.

Yellow and pink marble was used for the main house floors and guest wings, and small groups of low sofas and tables were added to encourage a relaxed atmosphere.

The couple's collection of works by Picasso and Van Gogh hung on the lava stone walls. After their death, the collection was donated to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Prints of the originals now hang in their place. A Rodin statue of Eve still remains in the atrium however.

For all its grandeur, Sunnylands was the Annenbergs' home for at least five months of the year, from 1966 to 2009.

When the Queen of England stayed with them in 1983, Mr Annenberg told her she would 'see how ordinary Americans live'.

Mrs Annenberg always went out of her way to make her guests feel comfortable, ensuring magazines to suit their individual interests were left out for them, and that color-coordinated jelly beans were put in the guest bedrooms, which were decorated in either yellow or pink.

The procession of famous guests to Sunnylands, including seven Presidents, Fred Astaire and Sammy Davis Jr, would join the Annenbergs in watching movies on a large screen, for lunch by the pool or a simple game of the couple's favorite pastime, Backgammon.

When the couple died, their generosity and love for Sunnylands led them to turn the estate over to the public.

After a $60.5 million renovation last year, the estate opened to visitors for four days a week - as long as world leaders aren't using it.

The couple's love of art was reflected in the garden, which was designed to look like Van Gogh's 1889 painting, Olive Trees.

Landscape architect James Burnett was commissioned to transform nine acres of desert scrub into a masterpiece of color that would constantly change with the seasons.

Visitors can meander along one and a half miles of path, which take in the vibrant native desert plants and reflection pools, as the 10,000 San Jacinto mountain looms in the distance.

'We like desert plants for their beauty, sculptural habits, and color,' Burnett had said.

His choice was also an environmentally friendly one. Despite the expansive, colorful garden, it uses only 20 per cent of the water allotted to the resort's grounds.

The gardens have become a haven for wildlife, with cotton tails, jack rabbits, iguanas and monarch butterflies regularly spotted.

With its peaceful surroundings, and luxuriant interiors, Sunnylands has often been described as an escape from the real world.

This was certainly the case for Richard Nixon, who stayed there after his resignation as President in 1974.

After his visit, he wrote: 'When you're down, you find out who your real friends are,' according to NPR.

The
 estate's nine-hole golf course, designed by Dick Wilson in 1964, and 
opened for rounds before the house was completed, was popular with 
President Eisenhower, who was the first president to play a round on it.

The Annenbergs had wanted their beloved Sunnylands home to continue to be used like a West Coast version of Camp David.

This
 weekend is the first time world leaders will use it since Mrs Annenberg 
died in 2009. The estate is run as a non-profit organization made up
 of the couple's children and grandchildren.

When
 President Obama arrives for talks this weekend, he will use the 17,000 
square foot purpose built building commissioned by Mrs Annenberg to be 
used for retreats.

The
 building, which was finished in 2011, should feel like home for the 
President - its interiors were designed by Michael Smith, who also 
refurbished the Obama family's living area in the White House.

During the crucial meetings with the Chinese leader, President Obama is expected to tackle China's alleged cyber attacks to try to steal information from the U.S. government and private sector.

'We expect this to become a standing issue in the U.S.-China relationship, given the importance of cyber security to the global economy,' a senior administration official told ABC News.

The superpower leaders are also due to discuss economic co-operation, human rights abuses, and North Korea.
