A survivor of Elliot Rodger's deadly rampage has recounted the heart-wrenching phone call she made to her mother after she lay beside her two dying friends.

'I've been shot,' Bianca de Kock, 20, told her mother Sharrese. 'I don't know what 
happened. It's crazy. But I love you. I love you so muchâ€¦ 
I'm afraid I'm going to die.'

The 20-year-old student was walking with two of her Tri Delta sisters to their sorority house at the University of California, Santa Barbara on Friday when they were sprayed with bullets.

De Kock, whose arm and chest were struck, was the only survivor; her friends, freshman Veronika Weiss, 19, and senior Katie Cooper, 22, both died in the attack.

Fears: De Kock, pictured with her family, called her mom, top left, after she was hit to say she loved her

Speaking to Good Morning America in an interview that aired on Friday, she recounted seeing the shooter, Elliot Rodger, smile at the girls from his black BMW before he pulled the trigger.

'He wanted to do this,' she said of the attack. 'He looked happy about it.'

She initially thought they were hit by rubber bullets, but 'then I realized I'm bleeding, I'm in pain,' she said. 'It didn't seem real.'

Another student, Kyle Sullivan, heard the gunfire and ran towards the girls. He searched for a police officer and took the officer to the scene, before laying down beside de Kock, comforting her, before she was taken to hospital.

'I was just trying to be there for her,' he told GMA. 'And make sure that she would make it through it.'

De Kock said that she believes his comforting words helped pulled her through.

'I don't think I would have made it without any support,' she said, adding that she knew they would now be firm friends: 'We're going to be bonded now.'

She was released from hospital on Monday and has returned to her family's home in Alameda, California. She said she does not think she will be able to return to the university to finish the semester, but that she still has every intention of graduating.

She also refuses to read Rodger's manifesto or watch his videos, in which he describes his plan to 'slaughter' every girl in a sorority house to get back at them for paying him no attention.

De Kock is also trying to come to terms with being the only survivor, while her friends passed away.

Survivor: Nick Pasichuke also survived the attack last week and spoke out from his bed on Thursday night

Injuries: He broke both of his legs and suffered facial fractures after he was hit by Rodger's car near campus

Determined: He is on his school's water polo team and has already told his coach he will be back next season

'They were both two very incredible, beautiful people,' she said through tears. 'And that's how I want them remembered.'

Her parents said they are also trying to come to terms with how the tragedy happened.

Sharrese de Kock asked: 'How did he slip through the cracks? It shouldn't happen.'

Another survivor, Nick Pasichuke, also spoke out from his bed on Thursday night to say that, while it is a sad time, people should remember how many people pulled through. As well as the six students who lost their lives, 13 people were injured.

Pasichuke, who appeared weak and covered with scratches, was hurt when Rodger plowed him down as he rode his longboard while visiting a friend at the campus.

'I want to come out here and show a positive side to it,' he told Anderson Cooper on CNN. 'It's a time where a lot of people are feeling sad and I don't want people to be so distracted by that side of it to forget that people survived this thing.'

Pasichuke, a University of Pacific freshman, explained that he was riding his longboard with a friend and chatting and 'the next thing I know, a car comes and just swoops me into the air,' he said.

Before he was hit, he had heard pops, but thought nothing of it.

'The first time we thought it was probably fire crackers or something,' he said. 'We thought it was just some commotion in the street.'

He said that only about 10 minutes after he was hit did they realized the pops were bullets.

Scene: After hitting Pasichuke and a cyclist, Rodger crashed into parked vehicles and shot himself dead

Pasichuke broke both of his legs and sustained facial fractures and scarring on much of his body from the impact. His friend was also injured, but was able to walk after the accident.

Pasichuke underwent surgery on Saturday and he is resting up. He also vows to get back to water polo next season.

'I'm in a bit of pain but it's nothing I can't manage, nothing that can't be fixed over some time,' he said.
