Two Boston park rangers were stabbed Tuesday by a homeless man with a violent history at the Boston Common, the nation's oldest public park. 

Police Commissioner William Evans said Tuesday night that Bodio Hutchinson, 34, attacked the unarmed rangers in an unprovoked confrontation at about 4:30 pm.

A 46-year-old ranger sergeant is in surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital with life-threatening injuries, Evans said.

The second victim,a 23-year-old ranger new to the service, is in stable condition at Tufts Medical Center with less serious wounds.

A witness says the rangers approached the man and asked him to put out his cigarette — and fight broke out when he refused, FOX 25 reported. Witnesses said

Boston mounted police keep a perimeter around the scene where two park rangers were stabbed Tuesday in an unprovoked confrontation. One of the victims, a 46-year-old sergeant, is fighting for his life in the hospital

 'We run up here, we see cops —  just like, bleeding,' another eyewitness, Jackson Marchant, told the Boston Globe. 

'A lot of people were helping the cops. But he was stabbed right in the central stomach, and it was bloody, it was bleeding, his whole torso was covered in red.

'He was holding himself, praying.' 

Witnesses say officers followed the suspect as he ran into the nearby Public Garden 

'He stopped and he told them to shoot him,' Nicholas Rusk, 19, told the Globe. 'They didn’t shoot him, they just tackled him to the ground.'

Witnesses took a series of pictures of the arrest and handed them over to police.

Evans said a knife police believe was used in the attack was recovered from Frog Pond.

'He’s not a newcomer, obviously, to the criminal justice system,' Evans told reporters. 

Evans said Hutchison faces attempted murder charges.
