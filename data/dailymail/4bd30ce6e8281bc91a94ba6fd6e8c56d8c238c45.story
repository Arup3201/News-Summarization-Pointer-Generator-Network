Jungle MP Nadine Dorries arrived back in Britain today, and immediately put herself at odds with the Tory leadership.

The Mid Bedfordshire MP insisted she would 'do it again tomorrow' as she was confronted by paparazzi photographers at Heathrow after viewers made her the first contestant to be booted out of I’m A Celebrity…. Get Me Out Of Here.

But the outspoken Conservative contradicted party claims she had been suspended or summoned to a meeting with Chief Whip Sir George Young and claimed to have missed only three parliamentary days, despite the Commons sitting 11 times while she was away.

Nadine Dorries arrived back in Britain today to face the music after her appearance on Iím A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!

The Mid Bedfordshire MP used Twitter to express her alarm at the media scrum as she arrived back in Britain, and defended taking time off from Westminster

She told reporters she would 'do it all again' but said press reports about her were wrong.

'I’ve only taken three parliamentary days off,' she said. 'The whip has not been withdrawn, it’s incorrect.'

She also denied she was set to have a meeting with Sir George. 'I’ve not been summoned for any meetings.'

However, Tory HQ has repeatedly said they expect her to meet with party whips as soon as she returns to Westminster.

Tonight a senior Conservative source said: 'When Nadine went to the jungle, she was suspended from the party, pending a meeting with the Chief Whip. Now a meeting can take place and I presume that meeting will take place soon.

'It is for her to meet with the Chief Whip and we will see what happens at that meeting.

'She will have to explain herself to the Chief Whip. She says she sought permission from the whips and received permission - the whips that were around at the time say that's not the case.'

Mr Cameron has 'input' into decisions on party discipline, but it is for Sir George Young to restore or withdraw the whip, said the source.

The Mid Bedfordshire MP claimed she wanted to use her appearance on I'm A Celebrity to discuss political issues in front of a TV audience of millions

A Downing Street insiders today said she had been 'very clearly' informed in a letter that she was suspended pending a meeting.

'The Chief Whip will decide her fate after the meeting,' the source added.

It is understood the meeting could take place as early as tomorrow, with Mr Cameron determined to send a clear message to other Tory MPs his unhappiness at her decision to swap Parliament for the Australian jungle.

Before flying home, she took a swipe at critics in her own 
party, claiming female MPs who condemned her for abandoning her 
constituents were fuelled by ‘jealousy’.

Ms Dorries had claimed she wanted to reach out to voters through the TV series, but she became the first celebrity to be dumped out of the jungle

David Cameron led the criticism of her decision to take up to a month off from Parliament to take part in the ITV show.

'If you're in the Australian jungle 
you can't really be representing your constituents either in 
Bedfordshire or in Parliament,' he said earlier this morning.

Chief Whip Sir George Young suspended Ms Dorries from the Tory party, 
and is expected to summon her for a face-to-face meeting to explain her 
actions.

Announcing her 
return on Twitter, she wrote: ‘Arrived in Heathrow to scores of Paps - 
has world gone mad? I’ve HAD ONLY 3 SITTING DAYS AWAY!! REST WAS HALF 
TERM!’

Last Thursday, when the Commons was debating women bishops, giving prisoners the vote and welfare reform, Ms Dorries was pictured going down a slide with Linda Robson, Charlie Brooks and Ashley Roberts

Instead of taking part in Commons debates, the Mid Bedfordshire MP was seen chatting with former darts champion Eric Bristow

Ms Dorries hoped to use the platform to discuss her policy concerns, but was instead seen fretting about the loud voice of TV chef of Rosemary Shrager

From the moment Ms Dorries arrived in Australia she has been the target of intense criticism from Tory colleagues, including several female MPs who accused her of making it harder for women to be taken seriously in politics.

But in an interview before flying home, Ms Dorries was unrepentant when asked if she thought she would be frozen out on her return to Westminster.

‘Do I care? Why would I know? Why would I be interested in that? The word jealousy springs to mind actually,’ she told Iain Dale on LBC 97.3.

‘I know what’s happened. A lot of MPs including the female MPs, and the female MPs I’ve been told are the critical ones are the jobless and the more ambitious.’
