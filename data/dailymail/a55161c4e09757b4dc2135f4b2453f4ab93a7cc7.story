With their exit from the FA Cup against Arsenal, Manchester United's attention now rests solely on their Premier League campaign.

Supporters won't expect Louis van Gaal to be winning any silverware this season, but a top four finish is a must for a club that invested heavily in the summer. 

Is that now a realistic possibility, though? United haven't beaten a side currently in the top half of the Premier League since their home win against Liverpool in mid December last year.

Manchester United face a testing final 10 games in the Premier League, they'll play all of their rivals 

Louis van Gaal has won less than half of his games against side's in the top six of the Premier League 

To make matters worse, they now face the prospect of playing four of the top six in their next five games (and all of them before the end of the season).

With Liverpool just a point behind United in the league, and Tottenham a further two points behind them, Van Gaal knows he can't afford to slip up.

His record against the top six, though, is not especially encouraging. A fortuitous win at Arsenal and comfortable victory against an out-of-form Liverpool are the only notable moments.

Monday's FA Cup tie proves the Gunners will be no pushover and Liverpool are unbeaten in the league since their loss at Old Trafford in 2014.

With just 10 games to go until the end of the campaign - half are away from home and half are against direct rivals - Van Gaal and his side will need to show considerably better form to secure Champions League football next season.

After Angel di Maria's red card against Arsenal, United will be without their record signing for the next match

United will have to stop the league's most in-form striker when they face Tottenham in their next game

Tottenham (H) - Sunday March 15

These two sides drew 0-0 at White Hart Lane earlier in the season but with the Premier League's most in-form striker among Spurs' ranks this will be a stern test for United, who will be without the suspended Angel di Maria. 

Liverpool (A) - Sunday March 22

A formidable proposition for Van Gaal. Liverpool haven't lost in the league in three months and have won nine of their last 11 matches. 

Aston Villa (H) - Saturday April 4

A month ago United fans would have considered this an easy win but Tim Sherwood has reinvigorated Villa, who have now won their last two games in all competitions.

Liverpool have not lost a Premier League game since they were beaten by United in December 2014

United still have to host their fiercest rivals, and Premier League champions, Manchester City

Manchester City (H) - Sunday April 12

United lost to their rivals 1-0 at the Etihad Stadium, City aren't in the most convincing spell of form but they are the Premier League champions nonetheless. 

Chelsea (A) - Saturday April 18

Away at the league leaders. This isn't a match Van Gaal can rely on getting anything from. 

Everton (A) - Sunday April 26

Everton have struggled this season but Goodison Park is always a difficult place to go, as United know well from recent history. 

A trip to league leaders Chelsea will be arguably the most difficult challenge of United's season

Arsenal's win at Old Trafford in the FA Cup quarter-final suggests this will be a difficult match for hosts

West Brom (H) Saturday May 2

Arguably the easiest of their remaining games, but Tony Pulis will make sure West Brom don't go down without a fight. 

Crystal Palace (A) - Saturday May 9

Alan Pardew's Palace are a force to be reckoned with at Selhurst Park. Arsenal can testify to that - the Gunners were fortunate to escape with three points when they visited and so will United. 

Arsenal (H) - Saturday May 16

Arsene Wenger's side are in fine form and their win at Old Trafford in the FA Cup quarter-final suggests this will be a difficult match for hosts. 

Hull City (A) - Sunday May 24

After an abysmal start to the season, Steve Bruce's side are finally finding some form and have only lost once in their last five matches.
