A Texas man is fighting for custody after his live-in girlfriend dumped their baby son at a fire station a week ago, fearing she would 'stab him.'

The man, who hasn't been identified, said he didn't know the mother, who has also not been unnamed, had abandoned the eight-month-old child until he saw it on the news and claims she lied when he asked where the boy was.

Firefighters at Houston's Fire Station 39 discovered the infant on Monday when they returned from a call and heard crying.

'The firefighters were inside trying to get breakfast. At about 10:05, they heard a baby crying,' Houston Fire Department spokesman Captain Ruy Lozano told ABCNews.com.

They went outside and found the child in a stroller.

'They immediately grabbed the baby and took him inside out of the heat because it's very hot in Houston right now,' Lozano said.

The baby was 'clean, well-fed and well-dressed' and firefighters played with him until protective services arrived. The boy was then taken to the hospital to be examined.

'He was released yesterday evening from the hospital and placed in a foster home,' Child Protective Services spokesman Estella Olguin told ABC.

The man said his girlfriend told him she was dropping the infant with his 'real father' when she abandoned him at the station. He believes he is the child's father though a DNA test to confirm paternity is underway.

The mother came forward at an emergency hearing on Tuesday. She said she abandoned the baby 
because she couldn't take care of him
but Olguin wouldn't give details.

A source told KHOU the mother explained to the judge she dropped the baby off because she was afraid she might stab him. Neighbors said she recently tried to leave the child with its grandfather and kicked another son, a teenager, out of the house.

'She didn't come forward to claim 
him,' Olguin said. 'She really just came forward to say, "I am the 
mother and these are the reasons I surrendered him."'

Under Texas law, parents who cannot care for their child can leave the infant at a safe place such as a fire station, hospital or EMS station up to the age of 60 days, without facing questions or charges.

Because this baby is older than 60 days protective services have to investigate the case and seek out relatives who might want to care for the baby.

Protective services have taken a DNA sample from the woman and they are sure she is the child's mother.

'She showed us legal documentation -- birth certificate, medical records, Social Security -- and photographs. And she looks like him,' Olguin said. '(There are) photographs of the baby throughout the few months of his life and we really have no doubt that she is the mother.'

When protective services contacted the baby's father he said he wanted to take custody of the child.

A DNA sample will be taken confirm paternity and the infant will remain in foster care in the meantime.

Lozano applauded the woman's actions.

'The lady still showed a lot of courage,' he said. 'I don't know what's going on in her life. Sometimes they feel so desperate they don't see any other way out.

'I'd rather have them taken to a fire station than for me to make those calls where I find a baby in a dumpster or a ditch.'
