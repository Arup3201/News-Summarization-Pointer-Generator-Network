Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's bizarre baby name instantly became the subject of jokes around the globe after it was revealed on Thursday.

And it seems even the reality TV star, 32, found the name North West rather humorous when it was first raised in public during an interview with Jay Leno back in March.

Not going for North: Kim Kardashian firmly turned down the idea that her child would be named North West in a March interview with Jay Leno

It's official: A birth certificate obtained by MailOnline reveals that the little girl will be called North West, with no middle name

Three months before giving birth, Kim laughed at Leno when he brought up rumours Kanye wanted to name the baby North - 'so he [or she] would be North West.'

Without batting an eyelash, a giggling Kim immediately dismissed the idea and the audience guffawed along with her. 

'That is not one of the names on our list,' she insisted, before adding: 'But that I do like Easton West.'

'It kind of goes with North. I think that's cute,' she said with a smile.

Despite her chuckles, North West turned out to be no joke - MailOnline obtained a copy of the 
birth certificate on Friday, confirming that the couple have settled on the moniker - and no middle name.

There was widespread speculation that Kim would follow her family's 'K' tradition but even back in March she admitted that her baby name list was varied.

'Some of them are K names and some of them are not,' she said.

Another direction: The 32-year-old instead offered the name Easton West, which she thought was 'cute'

Mixing things up: Kim also said that she's fond of the trend to give girls names traditionally used for boys

News
 of the baby's name comes five days after Kim was rushed to a hospital 
in Los Angeles on June 15, giving birth to her daughter after going into
 labour five weeks before her due date.

One week later, the pair checked out of the hospital following the premature birth. 

And a source told UsWeekly that the couple have already given their daughter a nickname - she will be 'Nori for short'.

Proud parents: Kim and partner Kanye West welcomed their first child on 15 June

While North was to prove her final 
choice, Kim was said to be very keen on Kaidence, to match her family's 
fondness of the letter 'K'.

The reality star was reported to like the idea of calling the baby Kai for short.

And further report claimed the middle name would be Donda, in honour of Kanye's 
late mother, who died in 2007 due to complications from cosmetic 
surgery.

Nothing official: Despite the birth certificate leak, Kim has yet to make a statement on the baby's name

Meanwhile Kim's close friend Larsa Pippen recently revealed that she had been to visit the baby in the hospital and a decision was nearly made.

But she said Kim didn't welcome her suggestions.

'We kind of went back and forth and the name that I wanted, [Kim] didn't love,' she said.

First for everything: The name of the baby was predicted to start with K, just like the names of the couple and of Kim's siblings

Kim gave birth to her first child Saturday 15 June.

Mail Online exclusively revealed that the reality star had been admitted to hospital in Beverly Hills the night before.

Kim had taken out a birthing suite at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a hospital of choice among many celebrities including Britney Spears, Victoria Beckham and Jessica Simpson.

Hours later - around 1:30 a.m. - she gave birth to her baby girl, now believed to be named North.

Her partner, rapper Kanye, and mother Kris Jenner were reportedly at her side.

Kim's due date was reportedly July 12, just one day after Kate Middleton. 

The date would also have been Kanye's mother Donda West's 64th birthday.
