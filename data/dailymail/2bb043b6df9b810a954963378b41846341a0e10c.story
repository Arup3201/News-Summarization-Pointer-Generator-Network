One type of medication prescribed for Parkinson's increases the risk of compulsive behaviours 

A drug company has offered a settlement to patients who claim they became addicted to gambling and sex after taking medication to treat Parkinson's disease.  

Pfizer has confirmed it has proposed the settlement after class action was taken by 150 patients.

They claim they were not warned of the side effects.

A hearing had been scheduled in the Federal Court of Australia next year, the Guardian reported.

But the settlement offered is now set to be considered by the court, who will decide whether to agree it.

A Pfizer spokeswoman said: 'On that basis, Pfizer Australia is unable to make any further comment at this time.'

A study published earlier this year found drugs commonly prescribed to treat Parkinson's disease increase the risk of behaviours such as sex addiction, compulsive shopping and gambling.

Parkinson’s is a degenerative condition that occurs when nerve cells in the brain die, causing a lack of the chemical dopamine.

This, in turn, interferes with movement and co-ordination.

The disease is incurable - the aim of treatment is to alleviate the symptoms.

There are two types of medication: ‘levodopa’ drugs, used since the Sixties, and ‘dopamine agonists’, introduced 12 years ago.

Both attempt to replace the missing dopamine, but the levodopa group restores it artificially, while dopamine agonists mimic its role by stimulating nerve cells.

Impulsive and compulsive behaviour is a known side-effect of both types of medication, although it’s more common with dopamine agonists.

Up to 14 per cent of patients develop changes in behaviour.

These problems can be extensions of existing traits - for example someone who has always enjoyed a flutter might develop more of a gambling problem.

In a new study, researchers found dopamine agonist drugs were made patients more likely to indulge in pathological gambling, hypersexuality and compulsive shopping.

Usually these habits disappear once patients stop taking the medication. 

Those affected find themselves trapped in an almost impossible situation: their compulsions are caused by medication, but they can’t stop taking it because it would leave them unable to function physically. 

The Parkinson’s Disease Foundation says in one earlier study, dopamine agonists were linked with compulsive behaviours in up to 14 per cent of patients.

While these side effects have been known for around a decade, researchers at the Institute for Safe Medication Practices in Alexandria, Virginia, wanted to investigate the link further. 

Lead author Thomas J. Moore and his team analysed 2.7 million serious drug side effects reported in between 2003 and 2012 in the U.S. and 21 other countries. 

They identified 1,580 impulse control disorder events - 710 linked to dopamine agonist drugs and 870 associated with other drugs.

The dopamine agonists were most often prescribed for Parkinson’s disease but were also sometimes prescribed for restless leg syndrome.

Up to 14 per cent of patients develop changes in behaviour. 

Dopamine agonist drugs were 277 times more likely to result in a report of specific impulse control symptoms than other drugs, Mr Moore told Reuters Health. 

'This tells you that reports associating a drug with pathological gambling or hypersexuality are extremely rare, except for this group of drugs,' he said.

The actual risk could in fact be higher, since the data relies on official reports of drug side effects, added Joshua J. Gagne, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.

The study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine.

Daiga Heisters, of Parkinson’s UK, said: ‘A significant minority of those taking dopamine medication find they have problems with compulsive behaviour.

‘Every individual reacts differently to Parkinson’s drugs.

'By talking with their specialist, they can look at altering the dose or drug, and side-effects can be alleviated or even eliminated.

‘It’s important doctors make their patients aware this can happen and monitor them.’

The three main symptoms of Parkinson’s disease are tremor (involuntary shaking of particular parts of the body), slow movement and stiff and inflexible muscles.

Other symptoms include depression, constipation, problems sleeping, loss of sense of smell and memory problems.
