A member of the House of Lords has broken a 40-year-old world speed record for an electric car.

Former Science minister Lord Drayson smashed the previous record of 175mph behind the wheel of his converted Lola Le Mans race car.

He achieved the feat in the 600bhp race car at the RAF Elvington Airfield in Yorkshire on Tuesday evening where he achieved the staggering speed of 204.185mph.

The previous record for an FIA-sanctioned vehicle of 175mph was set by the US-built Battery Box Electric almost 40 years ago back in 1974

Lord Drayson, 53, an entrepreneur who was the science minister from 2008 to 2010, had to perform two runs at the airfield within an hour for the record to stand

The previous record for an FIA-sanctioned vehicle of 175mph was set by the US-built Battery Box Electric almost 40 years ago in 1974.

The Labour peer’s record-breaking ‘Drayson B12 69/EV electric Le-Mans Prototype’ is built by Drayson Racing in Oxford.

Lord Drayson, 53, an entrepreneur who was the science minister from 2008 to 2010, had to perform two runs at the airfield within an hour for the record to stand.

He said: 'I’m delighted we’ve beaten the record tonight and can show the world EVs can be fast and reliable.

'Drayson Racing is a laboratory for EV technology, testing it to the most extreme level, as we’ve seen today.

'It is not the outright speed that is most impressive about this record, but the engineering challenge of accelerating a 1,000kg electric vehicle on a short runway over a measured mile.

'What it, I hope, shows to people is just what the future potential of electric cars is.'

Drayson Racing is a research and development business, pioneering the development of sustainable technologies in the challenging environment of motorsport.

With the electric land speed record it intends to showcase what is possible with an electric drivetrain and underscore Britain’s leadership position in the EV industry.
