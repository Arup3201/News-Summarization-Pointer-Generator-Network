Dallas officials have revealed the city spent $155,000 on the emergency response to the Ebola crisis, including $27,000 to care for nurse Nina Pham's spaniel for three weeks.

City officials released a statement Wednesday outlining the expenses incurred since Thomas Eric Duncan was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in September.

Duncan died about a week later. Two nurses, Amber Vinson and Ms Pham, who treated him became infected, but both recovered in October and the city was officially declared Ebola-free November 7.

One pricey puppy: Nina Pham's dog, Bentley, cost the City of Dallas $27,000 in expenses during his three weeks in quarantine 

Pampered: City officials shelled out more than $17,000 to prepare a pet care facility at a naval base for Bentley, where vets in hazmat suits checked up on him twice-daily 

Pham's beloved dog, a King Charles spaniel, was quarantined for 21 days at secret Dallas navy base and monitored twice-daily by veterinarians in hazmat suits for signs of the deadly virus.

The nurse and Bentley were privately reunited November 1 at a secret location.

At a news conference held that day, Pham tearfully thanked for the thoughts and prayers for 'me and Mr Bentley,' whom she called 'one of my best friends.'

Ms Pham was the first Ebola patient in the US to have been in contact with a pet as she came down with the virus. She requested that her pup be placed in quarantine instead of destroyed like a Spanish nurse's dog.

City officials shelled out more than $17,000 to prepare the pet care facility for Bentley, which came equipped with a special cage to collect his excrement for testing and disposal.

Another $1,000 was spent on supplies, and more than $2,000 on a generator and to cover labor costs. An additional $6,000 went towards clean-up expenses.

The cost of the pup's care will be offset by $19,000 in private donations and grants, the city said.

'It speaks to the character of Texans and our love of animals. It was not even an option to put down a dog that had not been tested for Ebola,' Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed told TH Online.

The city's other Ebola-related expenses included hazardous material response, police and fire department overtime and bills for the care and security of Duncan's family, who were put under a mandatory quarantine that required relocation from the contaminated apartment Duncan had stayed at.

Under observation: Workers in hazmat suits removed Bentley from Pham's home, and took him to a special isolation room at a nearby naval base. He has been treated by veterinarians and other workers every day

Hazmat response totaled nearly $60,000 in expenses, according to the report, and almost $19,000 went toward rehiring paramedics for a 21-day monitoring period.

The invoice released by the city does not include expenses paid for by Dallas County, the state or federal agencies in response to the Ebola crisis.

Meanwhile, the Texas Department of State Health Services says it incurred about $1.28million in costs.
