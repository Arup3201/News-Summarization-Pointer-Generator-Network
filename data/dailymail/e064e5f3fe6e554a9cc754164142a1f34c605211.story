Christopher Symons, 63, was jailed today for murdering his business partner Patricia Goodband, 76, and throwing her down a brick shaft to try to get a 1m inheritance

A policeman's father was jailed for 27 years today for brutally murdering a millionairess with a wrench before dumping her battered body in a disused 12ft well and covering it with soil from a cemetery.

Christopher Symons battered wealthy 76-year-old Patricia Goodband to death and then devised a grand plan he dubbed, 'The 12 days of Xmas', in an attempt to inherit her fortune.

In a scrawled note the 63-year-old listed daily tasks to try to cover up the grandmother-of-two's murder and throw detectives off the scent.

The incriminating list was found in his car by detectives searching for clues over Mrs Goodband's murder and it was used as a vital piece of evidence in the case against him.

Amazingly Symons' own son Ben works as a Police Constable for Thames Valley Police - the same force investigating the death.

Symons mapped out his detailed plan and enlisted the help of his elderly lover and a grave digger friend to cover his tracks.

Today he showed no emotion when he was told he would probably die in prison as he will serve a minimum term of 27 years meaning he would be aged 90 years before there was a chance of parole.

Sentencing him at Reading Crown Court Judge Zoe Smith told Symons: 'This was a murder where the particulars of the offence were particularly high.'

Describing further the particulars of the killing which involved a heavy wrench, she said: 'The substantial planning. The concealment of the body. The false trail after her murder.

'The deceit employed to convince Mrs Goodband's daughter that her mother was missing and the recruitment of others to sure up your cover story.

'I find that the purpose of the murder was to ensure that your entitlement to her savings and house remained intact.'

Betrayed: Patricia Goodland was brutally murdered by her friend and business partner Christopher Symons just before Christmas last year

Symons' manipulated lover Jennifer Creasey, aged 73 years, was convicted of perverting the course of justice after making a false statement to police in a bid to protect him

She was sentenced to six months in jail.

His accomplice, Robert Taft, 60, previously admitted to misleading police by claiming he had dropped Mrs Goodband off at a railway station and a separate charge of possession of ammunition without a licence.

Police found 22 calibre bullets in a jacket pocket which Taft claimed Symons had given him. He too was jailed, but for only 10 months.

Mrs Goodband, who ran a haulage business with Symons, was last seen alive three days before Christmas on Decmber 22 last year.

The three-week trial had heard that Mrs Goodband was reported missing by her daughter Samantha McLoughlin, who lives in North Yorkshire, on January 9.

Symons sent himself a series of texts from Mrs Goodband's phone in a bid to mislead police.

He also got lover Creasey to write a fake Christmas card to Mrs Goodband and enlisted Taft’s help in fabricating the story that the divorcee had decided to travel north for the Christmas period.

Following a painstaking investigation Mrs Goodband's body was found concealed in the deep well shaft in the garden of her home in the rural village of Woodham, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire on January 21 this year.

She had been repeatedly beaten around the head before her body was thrown into the well.

Symons, from Aylesbury, was found guilty of a single charge of murder by a jury after just over four hours of deliberations.

Creasey, from Benson, Oxfordshire, was found guilty of one count of perverting the course of justice and Taft, also from Aylesbury, admitted the same charge.
