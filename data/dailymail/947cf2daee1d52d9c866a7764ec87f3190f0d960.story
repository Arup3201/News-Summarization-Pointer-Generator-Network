Louis Walsh has signalled he will quit X Factor at the end of this series.

The 62-year-old indicated he will stand down after 11 years, telling The Mail on Sunday: ‘You have to move on, I’ve got things to do. I’m still managing Shane [Filan] from Westlife and that’s my real job, you know.

‘I love doing X Factor but it’s not my only job.’

Louis Walsh has admitted that he wants to quit the X Factor after 11 years on the judging panel 

Walsh is the longest-serving judge on the series which began in 2004 and still attracts about 9 million viewers.

He intended to call it a day last year, only to be wooed back to do another series by X Factor creator Simon Cowell in a deal said to be worth £1 million.

The veteran music manager, who steered Boyzone and Westlife to success in the 1990s, has caused controversy on the show in the past by backing novelty acts such as Wagner, Goldie Cheung and Jedward.

This time round, it is ‘annoying’ sisters Blonde Electra, comprised of Jasmina and Ruby King – who claim they grew up in a cult led by their hippie parents who have disowned them as ‘sinners’ for liking pop music.

The prospect of Walsh’s departure follows reports that fellow judge Cheryl Fernandez-Versini wanted producers to hire someone younger to replace him.

Walsh, 62, said his day job was managing Shane Filan's solo career admitting that he 'loves doing X Factor'
