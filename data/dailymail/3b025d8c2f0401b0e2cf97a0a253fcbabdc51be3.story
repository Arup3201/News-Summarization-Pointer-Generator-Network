Hell hath no fury like a woman with a large supply of sanitary towels scorned.

Angry Li Tan, 23, from China, decided to stick sanitary pads to her boyfriend's car because she thought he was having an affair, according to People's Daily Online.

In fact, her loving partner De Wu, 24, was at a friend's house in the Dancheng Township in eastern China's Zhejiang province, planning a surprise birthday party for her.

Aftermath:  Li Tan went to the shop and bought 30 sanitary towels before sticking them to her boyfriend's car in front of stunned passers-by

Scorned: Angry Li Tan, 23, from China, decided to stick sanitary pads to her boyfriend's car because she thought he was cheating on her

When De failed to return home an hour after he'd promised, his furious girlfriend went to a nearby shop, bought 30 sanitary towels and stuck them on his rental car as stunned passers-by watched on.

Li's friend, Chung Chen, 24, said: 'She was furious, and I told her she should wait to see what he said before she attacked the car, as it wasn't even his.'

'But she wouldn't listen as she was convinced he was cheating on her and so I let her get on with it. It made her feel better,' she added.

Li then posted pictures of the Toyota online with the caption: 'That's right, I did it!!'

She was soon swamped with messages of support from online viewers. Xia Lo posted: 'Great move! That'll teach him.'

Tao Fang added: 'Hahaha, go for it, girl.' And Yu Feng wrote: 'You should have done it with used ones.'

Gloating: Li then posted pictures of the towel-covered Toyota online with the caption: 'That's right, I did it!!'

De was somewhat bewildered when he returned home and tried to explain why he had been out all night.

'I asked her what had happened and she flew into a rage,' he said. 'I explained what I had been arranging her surprise party for and showed her the reservation I had made online for a fancy restaurant I was going to take her to.

'I then told her her that all her friends were going to turn up later.

'She eventually believed me and we sorted things out, but I don't think anyone will want to rent that car anytime soon.'
