German neo-Nazis helped Palestinian terrorists kill 11 Israeli athletes during the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, newly released intelligence files reveal.

Abu Daoud, who is believed to the mastermind of the atrocity, met fascist Willi Pohl in Dortmund, according to a city police dossier kept secret for 40 years.

But despite the file being passed on to the German federal intelligence agency, Verfassungsschutz, there is no evidence that they acted upon the 2,000-page report.

And this lack of action allowed Daoud, who is named in the police report as his alias Saad Walli, to travel the country to meet fellow terrorists and plan the attack.

Pohl, who is now a crime fiction author, told magazine Der Spiegel: ‘I chauffeured Abu Daoud through the entire Federal Republic where he met in different cities with Palestinians.’

The 68-year-old, who insists he had no idea the group were planning the attack, claims he unwittingly also helped Daoud obtain false passports and other documents.

But Pohl allegedly later bragged to his employer about his contact with the extremist wing of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, according to the report.

Pohl, who spoke on the condition that he was not photographed, was later asked by the PLO's leadership to carry out vengeance attacks for the police killings of five militants, the files say.

Several possible attacks were considered, including a hostage-taking at the cathedral in Cologne, it was claimed.

But he was arrested in Munich in October 1972 and later jailed for two years for possession of illegal weapons.

Police
found he had hand grenades, firearms and a threatening letter from 
Black September addressed to a judge who was preparing to bring charges 
against Palestinians involved in the Munich massacre. The documents also
suggested Pohl helped to procure weapons that may have been used in the
atrocity itself.

Black 
September had used the same sort of grenades - made in Belgium from 
Swedish explosives - to kill the Israeli hostages, the files show.

Daoud, whose real name was Mohammed Daoud Odeh, died in July 2010 aged 73.

He claimed responsibility for the attack in his book Palestine, from Jerusalem to Munich, published in 1999.

He defended the act as a military operation against athletes who were military reservists.

Defeat: The burned wreckage of the helicopter in which nine Israelis held hostage were killed after a botched rescue mission

It
began on the morning of September 5, 1972, with six days left in the 
Games, when eight terrorists stormed the Olympic village and raided the 
Israeli contingent’s apartment.

Two Israeli athletes were killed and nine more were seized as hostages.

They demanded the release of over 200 Palestinians serving time in Israeli jails, along with two renowned German terrorists.

After a day of unsuccessful negotiations, the terrorists collected the hostages and headed for the military airport in Munich for a flight back to the Middle East.

At the airport, German sharpshooters opened fire, killing three of the Palestinians .

A horrifying gun battle ensued, claiming the lives of all nine of the hostages and two terrorists on board a helicopter.

The three surviving assassins were captured, but later released by West Germany following the hijacking a Lufthansa airliner by Black September.
