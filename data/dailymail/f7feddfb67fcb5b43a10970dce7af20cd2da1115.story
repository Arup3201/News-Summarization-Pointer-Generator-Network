Grandmother Delthy A. Graham, 50, was charged Thursday with child neglect while father DaQuan N. Smith, 35, was also busted on the charges.

Mother Eboni S. Tucker-Smith, 32, had an outstanding warrant for perjury.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that Ocoee police first came to the house when the Duke Energy company cut power to the home due to thousands of dollars in unpaid utilities. 

Police found the family squatting there.

Upon getting a search warrant to go through the house, they discovered toilets full of feces, trash strewn everywhere, and dog feces.

'There was old and current dog feces on the floors and beds of which appeared to be where the children slept,' according to the police. 'In two children's bedrooms the beds were old and dirty with mold and rust stains on them. I observed insects on top of the beds (roaches) and rotting food on the floors and the beds.'

A broken window in the bedroom had been used to throw trash into the backyard.

Police also observed that the refrigerator did not close all the way and was filled with roaches both dead and alive, and there was a loaded handgun in the master bedroom.

'The backyard of the home was filled with garbage bags, these bags had rotten food, roaches and I observed a rodent inside a fast food bag,' read the report.

The family had been driven to stealing water from a neighbor.

The unnamed children have since been turned over to a family member. 

The parents and grandparents have all bonded out of jail.
