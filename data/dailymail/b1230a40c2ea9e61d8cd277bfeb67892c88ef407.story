Evelyn Stevens had complained of being 'terrorised' before her death

The first picture of an elderly woman feared murdered outside a block of flats has been released as her family pay tribute to a 'vibrant and vivacious' loved one.

Evelyn Stevens, aged 88, had confided in neighbours she was being terrorised by a man in the days before she was discovered sprawled on the concrete below her flat.

The pensioner was even said to have changed the locks at the property and called the police about a man, who she had initially befriended.

She was spotted lying outside the property in a tree-lined street not far from the seafront on January 3.

Ms Stevens was discovered outside Baltimore Court in The Drive in Hove, East
Sussex

A second floor window above the body, was wide open and the victim was clad only in her nightwear. She lived at the property.

Today her family released an emotional statement in which they paid tribute to a woman with a 'love of the finer things in life.'

They said: 'We are saddened by the sudden and tragic loss of Evelyn Stevens. Evelyn was a vibrant and vivacious character, with a love of the finer things in life.

'We hope that she is now resting in peace. We fully support the police in their investigation, and ask that our privacy is respected at this time.'

Sussex Police have referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission after admitting they had previous contract with Mrs Stevens.

A police spokesman said: 'This is a matter of standard procedure.'

Jo Hewitt, a neighbour of Mrs Stevens, yesterday said: 'She was a lovely, eccentric lady who loved to wear hats and had bright red hair.

'She had spoken about a man who had befriended her but terrified her.

'She said she called the police last night and had changed the locks.'

A post mortem revealed Mrs Stevens had injuries consistent with a fall from height.

Detectives from Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding her death.
