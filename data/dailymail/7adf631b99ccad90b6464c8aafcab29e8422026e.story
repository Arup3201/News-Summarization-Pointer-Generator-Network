This is the horrifying moment 11 passengers found themselves trapped inside a London Underground station after striking workers locked up before the last train dropped them off.

The commuters were locked inside South Ruislip station in freezing conditions for almost an hour until a station employee returned to free them at 1am on Thursday morning.

Passengers called out for help after getting off a Chiltern Railways train at around midnight to discover the gates had been closed and locked.

Some of the passengers stranded at South Ruislip station were forced to climb over barbed railings to escape

The station, which provides mainline train services as well as Metropolitan Line underground connections, closed earlier than usual at 11pm due to the strikes.

Passenger Beren Reid, 22, said: 'The tunnel that goes under the mainline tracks and onto the station concourse had been shut off and padlocked at the point where it joins the underground passageway.

'From there we could see that the exits at the front of the building had also been shut off, and we tried calling out and rattling the gate to get the attention of tube staff but nobody came.'

On realising they were stuck, passengers called British Transport Police, who told them that an officer would be sent but could take up to 90 minutes.

Taking matters into their own hands one passenger hopped the fence and scavenged car parts from a nearby garage to build a makeshift ladder to help six of the ten other passengers get out.

Mr Reid added: 'One person managed to climb over the railing on the Southbound platform of the mainline station, and came round to the front to shout through the gates to inform us of an escape route.

'We were all weary, freezing, and angry that we would have to wait 30 minutes or more for help.

'The first person had to resort to parts of cars found near the car repair company based in the dark and dinghy service road adjacent to the station, to give the six other people daring enough to scale the fence a stepladder to get over.

'Once over the railing, they found themselves atop large commercial waste bins with flimsy lids that were six feet off the ground, but thankfully they all managed to get over safely.'

A dozen passengers were trapped for almost an hour at South Ruislip station in north west London on Thursday morning

The 48-hour London Underground strike ended yesterday evening but many still reported disruption across the network.

During the 48 hour strike there was no service on the Waterloo and City, Circle or Bakerloo lines.

The Picadilly and Central lines didn't operate through central London but services continued through some outlying stations.

The Jubilee and Victoria lines continued operating trains every five minutes throughout the strike but over a reduced distance.

The District and Metropolitan lines operated a severely reduced service with some station closures and trains ran on the whole of the Northern Line but 17 stations were closed.

When contacted today, Transport for London (TfL) claimed the mistake was nothing to do with them and was instead the fault of Chiltern Railways for dropping off the customers.

Chiltern Railways' Operations Director Andrew Munden said: 'We are incredibly sorry that our passengers were affected in this way, particularly on a day when travel in London was significantly disrupted.

'We are unique in that over half our stations in London are owned and staffed by London Underground.

'Serving these stations during a strike is a challenging and complex logistical exercise, as we are dependent on London Underground for many services including, on part of our route, signalling of trains.

'Despite these challenges, we took the decision to operate our full train service and allow passengers to travel, rather than cancel trains and inconvenience hundreds of customers. We had no indication that South Ruislip would be locked and, in fact, it had been open the night before with no issue.

'We hugely regret that our passengers were inconvenienced in this way, and will be reviewing our procedures with London Underground for future strikes.

'The reason this happened, however, was a direct consequence of us working hard to ensure we could provide a service to London Underground owned stations that would otherwise have gone without.'

A Transport for London spokesman said: 'The Chiltern Railways train dropped them off after the station closed.

'It was nothing to do with us other than our staff let them out.'

Central Line Operations Director Peter McNaught said: 'After South Ruislip Underground station had been closed for the evening, we were made aware that around 15 customers of Chiltern Trains, which also serves the station, had mistakenly got off at the station.

'We immediately sent a member of staff to open up our gates so that the customers could make their way home.'

Transport for London had earlier
 warned that services would still be disrupted after 9pm yesterday, and 
had urged people not to 'leave it too late to travel'.

Commuters wait to board a limited service Tube train during the strikes

TfL said almost three out of four Tube stations were open, with services running on nine out of 11 lines, although many commuters were forced to find other ways of getting to work

London Underground services returned 
to normal this morning after huge delays and disruption caused by the 
strike over ticket office closures.

Fresh talks will be held today to try to resolve the bitter dispute which sparked the strike.

The
 walkout by members of the RMT and TSSA unions officially ended at 9pm 
last night, but a further 48-hour stoppage is planned from next Tuesday 
evening if there is no deal at the talks.

Journeys on the capital's Barclays bicycle hire scheme were up by 50 per cent for the second day, although wet and windy weather persuaded many people to work from home.

Mike Brown, managing director of London Underground, who had urged the unions to bring forward the meeting, said he was grateful for the ‘patience’ shown by passengers.

The unions have been urging London mayor Boris Johnson to meet them to discuss the closures, which will see the loss of 950 jobs.

London Underground said eight of 11 lines were running trains, keeping London "open for business", but unions said the company had under-estimated the impact of the 48-hour walkout

LU said more trains ran to more destinations and more stations yesterday than on Wednesday, but passengers still faced disruption to Tube services, and long queues at bus stations and on roads

The mayor has refused to meet the 
unions unless they call off the industrial action. RMT leader Bob Crow 
said: ‘Our negotiators are geared up and ready to enter the exploratory 
talks.’

TfL
 said almost three out of four Tube stations were open yesterday, with 
services running on nine out of 11 lines, although trains were not 
stopping at some stations.

Mr
 Johnson said: ‘I understand how frustrating this has been for many 
Londoners and I'd like to thank them for their patience and stoicism 
during this completely unnecessary strike.

‘I am grateful to the London Underground staff who rejected this pointless action and worked, and to the hundreds of volunteers who are helping passengers through the day.

‘I'm pleased that having failed repeatedly to engage in constructive talks around TfL's modernisation plans, the unions have agreed to sit down with TfL at Acas.

‘Rather than hurting hard-working Londoners and hard-pressed small businesses, they should have been talking to TfL this week. That the unions won't negotiate until after the strike is over tomorrow says a lot about their failure to engage.

‘If, as they claimed yesterday, Mr Crow and Mr Cortes are happy to embrace modernisation, new technology and change, then what on earth are they doing on strike when these changes do just that and involve no compulsory redundancies?’
