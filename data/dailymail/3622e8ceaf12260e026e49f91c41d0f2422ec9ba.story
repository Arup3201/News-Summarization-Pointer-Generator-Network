The school district that includes Hershey, Pennsylvania, home of the U.S.'s largest chocolate maker, is urging parents to refrain from sending cupcakes and other sweets with their children on their birthdays.

Derry Township School District is joining a host of districts around the country that have been pushing healthier alternatives since July when restrictions on the nutritional content of food sold in schools took effect as part of a federal law that aims to curb childhood obesity.

Derry Township sent a letter to parents asking them to send items like pencils, pens and stickers instead of treats to mark special occasions.

Superintendent Joseph McFarland said during a school board meeting on Monday that elementary school administrators tried to make a list of healthy snacks but found it difficult to decide what should be on it, according to PennLive.com. 

He added that district personnel didn't know what goes into making homemade treats.

So instead they advised sharing pens and pencils or celebrate special days by doing something different such as wearing silly socks, McFarland said.

Board member Andrea Abruzzo suggested a compromise: parents who wanted to send cupcakes could also throw in some fruit or carrots.

Dan Tredinnick, director of school and community information with the district, said he and his colleagues were trying to encourage more non-food rewards, Fox 43 reported.

'We are not banning snacks, but we are steering folks who prefer to provide snacks, to do so as part of the four seasonal classroom parties each elementary room schedules,' he said. 'There's going to be no cupcake cops or anything like that. This is a collaboration with our community.'

The new federal rules, included in the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act championed by first lady Michelle Obama and her 'Let's Move!' campaign, only restrict food actually sold  in schools, including in vending machines, on snack carts and at daytime fundraisers, according to The Wall Street Journal. 

The law allowed for 'infrequent' fundraisers, and states could decide how many bake sales they would have that don't meet the standards. 

First lady Michelle Obama joins students at the food line to pick up lunch items at a school cafeteria in Alexandria, Virginia, in January. She has championed the federal rules that are leading more districts to restrict cupcakes and other sweets 

Many districts are going behind the restrictions and targeting foods that aren't sold, like the much-loved birthday cupcake. 

'We don't think that snacks are a bad thing,' Tredinnick said. 'We think that snacks have a place in everybody's diet, but food served in schools brings with a whole host of challenges. I think that there's other ways that we can collaboratively make kids feel special, and recognize their accomplishments, that don't necessarily have to involve food.'

The district's wellness policy has been in place since 2008, but Tredinnick said that but growing problems like food allergies helped compel them to send the letter. 

Parents, many of whom recalled enjoying bringing cupcakes to school as children, had mixed reactions to the effort.

Parent Kelsey Fox said she doesn't agree with the change but understands why it was made.  

'We brought in donut holes. That was a big deal, going through Dunkin Donuts,' she said. 'While I would like to bring in baked goods and homemade things, I also understand that it's better to be safe.'

Sarah Smith objected strongly to the change.  

'I think it's ridiculous that kids can't bring in cupcakes and things like that,' she said. 'It's their birthday; they're going to do it at home, so why not be able to share it with all of the other kids at school.'

At the board meeting on Monday, members acknowledged this will be an ongoing debate.

'It's a cultural issue in the community,' board member Chris Barrett said. 'The cupcake conundrum bears more discussion. There is a lot of confusion.'
