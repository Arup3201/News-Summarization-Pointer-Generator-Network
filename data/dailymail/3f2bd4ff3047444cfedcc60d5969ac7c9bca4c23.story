Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's sister has been arrested for allegedly threatening to bomb a New York City woman.

Police say Ailina Tsarnaeva, 24, made the threat via telephone Monday and turned herself in earlier today. 

She is charged with aggravated harassment targeting her boyfriend's former girlfriend who lives in Harlem. Police say the North Bergen, New Jersey, resident is due in court September 30.

According to the New York City Police Department, Ms Tsarnaeva called her boyfriend’s ex and told her: 'I know people who can go over there and put a bomb on you.'

Police say Ailina's boyfriend, identified by the New York Post and George Briones, has been locked in a dispute with his former lover over the custody of their three children.

After the threatening phone call, the unnamed 23-year-old Harlem resident contacted police, prompting Ms Tsarnaeva to turn herself in at around 2.30pm Wednesday, reported CBS Boston.

The 24-year-old North Bergen woman has been required to check in with Massachusetts probation officers since last October after prosecutors say she did not cooperate with a counterfeiting investigation. 

Tsarnaeva's arrest comes just days after it was revealed in the media that her sister-in-law, slain bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev's widow Katherine Russell, has moved in with Ailina and her sibling, Bella.  

The women were found by the news station WCVB two weeks ago living in a nondescript blue house in the New Jersey township of North Bergen - population 58,000 - located about 10 miles west of Manhattan.

Ailina and Bella's 20-year-old brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is currently awaiting federal trial for his role in the April 15, 2013, bombing that killed three people and left 260 others wounded.

The two ethnic Chechen brothers from southern Russia were accused of planting two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon finish line.

Tamerlan was killed in a getaway attempt after a gun battle with police. Dzhokhar, who was captured hiding in a tarp-covered boat outside a house in a Boston suburb and is hospitalized, was later charged with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill.

The Tsarnaev sisters have had legal problems of their own in recent years.

Ailina is expected to go on trial next month on charges of misleading police in a counterfeit money probe, while Bella stands accused of marijuana possession with intent to distribute.

Both women have visited their younger brother in jail. Dzhokhar is set to face trial in November.

Over the weekend, Ailina Tsarnaeva declared to a news crew from WHDH outside her home that her brothers had been framed.
