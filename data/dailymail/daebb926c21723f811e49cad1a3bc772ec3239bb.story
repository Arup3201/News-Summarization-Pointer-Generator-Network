A three-storey 28-bedroom country manor has been bought for just £600,000 - because it is too big.

Stunning Moreton House is a Grade II-listed 'gentleman's residence' near Bideford, Devon, which is spread over a staggering 34,250 sq ft.

This makes it around 35 times the size of the average UK home and more than half the size of a football pitch.

Bought for £600,000: Moreton House is a 28-bedroom 'gentleman's residence' in Devon, which was completed in 1821 - 60 years after work commenced

Set in five acres, it has a wealth of period features and boasts 28 bedrooms, 19 reception rooms, an impressive ballroom and eight bathrooms.

It was put on the market with a guide price of in excess of £500,000.

The mansion was given the eye-catching price-tag because it is simply too big.

There was international interest and offers of as little as £200,000 were made for the mansion from people wanting to turn it into a hotel, a wedding venue and even an academy for builders. 

Moreton House: This property boasts a wealth of period features and elegantly proportioned rooms spread over 32,000 sq ft

Beautiful interior: The stamp duty bill from a £7.1 million purchase would be enough to buy the mansion

But a price thought to be 'in excess of £600,000' has been agreed and the deal went through on Friday.

This is half the price of a one-bedroom flat in Mayfair and a around quarter of the price of a row of parking spaces which have just gone on sale in prime central London.

It is the same price car dealer John Collins paid for a pair of registration plates for his Ferraris last week.

Staircase and garden: Work on the mansion is thought to have been started in 1760 and it was completed in 1821

James Gibbs, land and new home director at Jackson-Stops & Staff, managed the sale.

He said: 'We had all sorts of people showing interest in Moreton House, with calls coming from Australia, Abu Dhabi, India.

'Some wanted to convert it into a hotel, others as a wedding venue and there was interest in it being used as a residential home.

'I believe the buyer will be using it as a family home and they have got a great deal. It is fitting it went through on Black Friday.

'We were proven right about the price, but if it was in the Home Counties it would have cost more than ten times as much.

'The buyers have upsized from another large home. Everyone is delighted with the sale.' 

Work on the mansion started in 1760 and it was completed 60 years later. George Buck, who was the High Sheriff of Devon, lived in the home.

Location: Moreton House is located near Bideford in north Devon, west of Barnstaple

Grounds: Set in five acres, it has a wealth of period features and elegantly grand rooms

Enormous: Moreton House, which appears to be in good condition, was given its attractive price because it is 'so big'

Over the years it has undergone significant changes and, in 1913, three of the first floor rooms overlooking the gardens were merged to create a ballroom with ornate ceilings and a parquet wood floor.

Other period features include ornate ceilings and fireplaces, bay windows and a Jacobean style staircase with carved newels. 

Mr Gibbs had previously said that if it was a tenth of the size it would probably still be the same price - with the buyer 'basically getting 90 per cent free'.
