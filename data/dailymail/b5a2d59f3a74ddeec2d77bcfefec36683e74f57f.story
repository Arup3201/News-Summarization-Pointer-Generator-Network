Los Angeles Angels hitting coach Don Baylor broke his right leg in a freak accident while catching Vladimir Guerrero's ceremonial first pitch Monday night.

The 64-year-old squatted to catch Guerrero's off-target throw but as he moved his right leg bent back awkwardly and he couldn't move.

Two team employees helped Baylor to the dugout, leaving the Angels in disbelief on the field at Angel Stadium. 

Baylor is a survivor of multiple myeloma, a cancer that attacks bone marrow and can increase the chance that the bones will break or fracture.

Baylor, who joined the Angels' coaching staff in the offseason, had to be helped off the field. 

He was taken to a hospital and is scheduled to have surgery tonight on his right femur.

The accident happened before the Angels' 10-3 loss to the Seattle Mariners.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Don right now,' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.

'Obviously it's a freak (injury). We'll see how it turns out.'

'It got me sick when I was warming up and hearing what happened in the dugout,' said Mike Trout, who hit a two-run homer in the first inning.

Baylor was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2003, and he is active in fundraising efforts to combat the disease.

The cancer can weaken bones all over and increase the chance that the bones will break or fracture, sometimes breaking from just a minor stress or injury.

The former manager of the Rockies and Cubs, he left the Arizona Diamondbacks in the offseason to return to Anaheim, where he played six seasons with the California Angels.

He replaced Jim Eppard as the Angels' hitting coach last October.

Los Angeles also hired assistant hitting coach Dave Hansen, who was the Mariners' hitting coach last season.

Baylor and Guerrero are the only AL MVPs in Angels franchise history. Baylor won the award in 1979 during arguably the best season of his 19-year major league career with seven teams.

Guerrero threw the ceremonial first pitch to celebrate his retirement with the Angels on a one-day contract.
