From the Eiffel tower in Paris and a Van Gogh painting, to the Northern Lights and a tiger, a nine-year-old boy in Texas is compiling a bucket list of things to see before he goes blind.

Ben Pierce is slowly losing his vision in both eyes because of scar tissue left over from health issues caused when he was born prematurely.

As his world gets dimmer, the adventurous little boy is trying to see as much of the world as possible so he can have clear memories of what it looks like.

Visual memories: Ben Pierce has written a bucket list of things he wants to see before he goes blind

Painting pictures: Ben hugs his mom, Heidi, as they look at Van Gogh's Haystacks after Dallas Museum of Art opened early just for the family

Doctors suggested to his parents Kit and Heidi that they should show him as many sights as possible so he would remember what things look like.

'Let him see the mountains and let him see the ocean. Take him to see animals so he can describe it better when he doesn't have the ability to see it,' Ms Pierce told KTLA.

She and her husband sat down with Ben and helped him create a bucket list of places and things he wanted to see.

Already Ben has managed to tick off a few items on his wish list, with the Dallas Museum of Art opening early recently so he could get a close up view of Van Gogh's Haystacks.

The family
 have been constantly amazed by the generosity of people who have heard 
about Ben's list and sent in donations, or helped make items on it 
possible.

In
 less than two days, more than $17,000 was raised on a Give Forward page to 
help Ben complete his wish list, which includes trips to Shakespeare's 
Globe in London, seeing waterfalls and safari animals, and visiting a 
toy factor.

Magical: During a trip to Harry Potter World, Ben was 'picked' by a wand at Ollivander's store

Spell bound: An anonymous donor paid for Ben and his family to visit Harry Potter World, above, after the nine-year-old revealed how much he loved the books

Out of this world: Ben takes a seat next to the flight director at NASA's Mission Control, who let him talk to astronauts in the space station

No one knows when Ben will lose his sight for good, and he is already learning to walk with a cane and perform everyday tasks such as cooking without relying on his eyes.

'I just don't want to be blind,' Ben told WFAA as he started to cry during a recent interview. But despite his fears, he is embracing what time he has left with his vision.

His eye problems are a lingering after effect of being born four months early. He weighted just 1lb 6oz at birth, and his eyelids were still fused shut.

While he bounced back from other health problems caused by his early arrival, his eyes have not been able to recover.

However, he is working hard at building up a visual memory bank through his bucket list, and already has visited Harry Potter World and mission control at NASA.

With a large family - Ben has five brothers and sisters - and a bucket list that covers several countries, the Pierces have been holding fundraisers to pay for some trips, and others have been provided by generous donors.

One anonymous donor paid for the family of eight to fly from their Texas home to Florida so Ben could explore Harry Potter World.

Family fun: On each trip, including one to meet NASA's astronauts, Ben is accompanied with his five brothers and sisters, and parents Kit and Heidi

Adventure: Doctors suggest to Ben's parents that they let him experience as many things as possible before losing his sight

Fighter: Ben weighed just over 1lb when he was born more than four months early. Although he is healthy, his eyes were damaged

Travel: Google Earth at NASA allowed Ben to see images of the Eiffel Tower, but he wants to see it for real too

The nine-year-old loves to read, and the books about the schoolboy wizard are among his favorites.

When he woke on the first day, Ben was able to see the spires of Hogwarts Castle from his hotel room. During the trip he was picked at Ollivander's store to let a wand choose him.

'He was so excited, I cried seeing his expression,' Ms Pierce wrote on a blog about the day trip.

'You try a few wands that cause funny mishaps (boxes flying off shelves, flowers dying) and then the correct wand chooses the child – complete with spotlight and music and burst of air blowing the child’s hair up. It was so fun!'

Some of his bucket list wishes were more straightforward. The technology fan wanted to visit an Apple store.

Generous: When Ben asked to visit an Apple store, the staff gave him a yellow Genius T-Shirt and an iPad

Original: Some of the bucket list trips are more unusual, such as this one to see a water tower

But when his parents reached out to a store, they not only welcomed Ben in and gave him one of the yellow T-shirts their Genius teams wear, they also gave him an iPad filled with apps to help those who are visually impaired.

He has also visited a water tower, watched books being made, visited farm animals and Dallas Zoo.

One of the more memorable trips was to NASA, where Ben and his family got to meet astronauts, tour mission control and listen to astronauts in the space station.

'[NASA] gave him an experience beyond his wildest dreams in so many ways. None of us could have imagined how incredible our visit would be,' Ms Pierce said, adding that Ben had been 'given him memories that will stay with him forever'.

The family know Ben won't be able to see everything for himself, so they have also asked for well-wishers to send postcards to him from their favorite places.
