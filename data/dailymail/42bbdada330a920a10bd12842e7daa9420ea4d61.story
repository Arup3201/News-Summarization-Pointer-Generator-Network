Glad to be alive: Performance poet Benjamin Zephaniah was just 45 minutes from death after suffering acute appendicitis

Lying on a hospital trolley,  his stomach gripped by spasmodic episodes of searing pain, Benjamin Zephaniah expected the journey to the operating theatre to be his last.

Diagnosed with appendicitis and warned of the possibility that he could be suffering from septicaemia (blood poisoning), the poet and writer knew the outcome looked bleak.

‘I just remember lying there thinking I could die here. But strangely, I didn’t mind for myself,’  he says.

‘I told myself I’d had a good life.

‘But then I kept thinking of my poor mum, who used to be a nurse and still volunteers as a hospital visitor in Birmingham.

'I’m one of eight brothers and sisters  and we’re so close. What would she do? This would break her heart.’

Fortunately, no one had to break such calamitous news to Mrs Zephaniah – even though doctors later told her 53-year-old son that he had been 45 minutes from death because of the advanced stage of his condition.

But speaking for the first time about nearly losing his life, Benjamin – known to a new generation through his role  in BBC series Peaky Blinders – does dwell on the irony that his non-drinking, non-smoking, exercise-loving vegan lifestyle gave him no protection from appendicitis, which randomly affects six in every 100 people in the UK.

What’s more, unlike Sir Elton John, who last year had his appendix out after two weeks of serious pain, he was given no advance warning.

The day of the trauma – March 22, 2012 – started like any other. Benjamin, professor of poetry at Brunel University in West London, had been lecturing students on novel writing when he felt a ‘little pop’ in his stomach.

‘I didn’t think anything of it,’ says Benjamin, who broke into the literary world while performing dub poetry alongside stand-up comedians and punk bands in 1980s London.

‘However, over the next few hours I started to feel slightly nauseous and I had a vague stitch in my right-hand side. I thought maybe it had just been a long day.

'Then as the pains started to get a little worse, I thought I had some kind of food poisoning since it reminded me of how I felt when I once ate an out-of-date can of pineapples.’

Back in his hotel room – his home is in Lincolnshire – he tried to sleep off the now escalating pain and sickness.

Get it out: How an appendix is removed during an operation

‘By about 6.30am, the pain was so bad that I was almost hallucinating. Somehow, I reached for the phone to call reception for help, but as I picked up the receiver I couldn’t speak. The receptionist must have heard me panting down the phone and raced upstairs. When I didn’t answer the door, he got someone to kick it down.’

He was rushed to Hillingdon Hospital and recalls a young doctor smiling over him. ‘She looked about 17, and the first thing she said was, “I’ve just read one of your novels.” I think she was trying to calm me down as she then told me I had suspected appendicitis and they needed to get me on the operating table – fast.’

The appendix is a finger-shaped pouch connected to the large intestine which sits in the lower right side of the stomach. An evolutionary throwback, it is ‘absolutely useless’, says surgeon Sanjay Agrawal of Homerton University Hospital in London and BMI London Independent Hospital.

However, if it becomes inflamed it must be removed urgently. Left untreated, the appendix can become abscessed, then gangrenous and burst, releasing poison into the abdomen, causing peritonitis – inflammation of the lining of the abdomen – which can spread rapidly to the rest of the body. Appendicitis is most common in people aged ten to 19 but can happen at any age, and it remains the most common reason for emergency surgery.

Appendicitis: If the appendix becomes inflamed it needs to be removed immediately

Agrawal says: ‘Appendicitis is usually triggered by a blockage at the entrance of the appendix which can then become inflamed.

'It can happen to anyone – there isn’t anything that makes one person more or less vulnerable.’ Sometimes, he says, the condition can be overlooked in its early stages, possibly confused with gastroenteritis, gallstones, or a urinary tract infection.

'There is only one treatment – removing the appendix, either through keyhole or open surgery.

‘It can take from 20 minutes to three hours depending on what the surgeon finds – such as a lot of infection,’ says Agrawal. ‘I have done one through open surgery in 12 minutes.’

Benjamin was told his operation would begin with keyhole surgery but if the appendix burst they would need to open him up to reach infected areas.

With keyhole surgery, three small incisions are made – one near the belly button, one about 1in long in the lower right of the stomach, and then a tiny incision in the middle of the bikini line.

A camera is placed through one incision to assess the state of the appendix. Then it is carefully removed through the port on the right side of the stomach.

Benjamin recalls: ‘I didn’t care how they did it. I wasn’t in a place to make decisions. Anyway, they gave me morphine and it all started to get a bit surreal. I remember the anaesthetist being this rather prim but kindly Miss Marple character while the theatre nurse was  a guy from Trinidad who kept up an optimistic patois, saying things like, “Tell me a poem, man.” ’

Although the appendix had ruptured, it had not burst. However, Benjamin was told it had been a close call. ‘It was almost ready to burst. My surgeon told me that had I waited another 45 minutes for help, I’d have been a dead man. Those words still play round and round my head – how close I was to not making it.

‘When I came round, I just thought, wow, I’m still here. What was incredible was that there were three of my students by my bed. They’d bought me fruit and Caribbean patties. I was so touched. The head of my department phoned and I burst into tears. I was glad to be alive.’

Benjamin spent two days in hospital, and then two weeks in Brunel recuperating before returning home. ‘Putting my key in the door was an emotional moment,’ he says. ‘At one point there was a chance I’d never come back. I also couldn’t help thinking how great the NHS had been. They cured me, and not one person asked me to write a cheque.’

Now fully recovered, the only manifestation of his ordeal are three small but fading scars. He continues to practise tai chi and yoga and always starts the day with an hour of aerobic exercise, such as cycling. He breakfasts on muesli and fruit and then eats nothing until about 6pm, when he enjoys a tasty vegan dish such as butter bean stew.

Benjamin says: ‘I never took life for granted, but what this has taught me  is that if I have the slightest twinge of inspiration, then I go for it. Everyone should feel this way.

‘Don’t wait until you’re challenged to do the same.’
