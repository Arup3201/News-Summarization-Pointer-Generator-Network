Royal pursuit: Prince Charles is a well-known country sports enthusiast

Licensed gun owners have expressed outrage over a new hotline which the public can call if they suspect neighbours with firearms are terrorists.

The new Crimestoppers number has also raised fears that it will be used by animal rights activists to make false accusations against country sports enthusiasts, whose numbers include members of the Royal Family, such as Prince Charles.

The Home Office-approved measure is designed to encourage anonymous tip-offs about individuals at risk of criminal or terrorist behaviour.

Andy Marsh, the Association of Chief Police Officers’ firearms spokesman, has called on members of the public, including shooting enthusiasts, to help police gather intelligence about possible extremists with access to firearms.

He said: ‘If you are concerned that guns are being kept insecurely or notice signs that shooters may be vulnerable to criminal or terrorist groups or have shown sympathy towards extremist acts, please report it.’

But the Countryside Alliance condemned the move as ‘an unwarranted attack on shooting’ and fears the hotline will lead to law-abiding citizens being wrongfully branded terrorists.

The organisation also insists there has not been one case of a lawful gun owner being radicalised to take part in terrorist activity, or any problem with the theft of licensed firearms.

Alliance chiefs condemned the hotline as ‘a waste of time and money and an unwarranted attack on shooting’ and said it could be used by activists to make false accusations.

Concerns: The new Crimestoppers number has  raised fears that it will be used by animal rights activists to make false accusations against country sports enthusiasts

Tim Bonner, director of campaigns, said he hoped to mobilise the country’s licensed gun owners to lobby the Government to drop the scheme. 

He said the campaign was ‘unjustified and ill-judged, and it will serve only to waste police resources and alienate a large and law-abiding section of the community’.

He added: ‘We have not been made aware of a single recent incident in which a licence holder has misused a firearm in pursuit of an extremist agenda.’
