Reseachers believe that people with a history of gout have their risk of developing Alzheimer's cut by a quarter 

People with a history of gout have their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease reduced by a quarter, a new study has found.

The painful joint condition, known as the disease of kings due to Henry VIII famously suffering from it, appears to have a protective effect on the brain, researchers have said.

They believe this is possibly thanks to the excess uric acid that is built up during a gout attack.

The study was carried out in the United States by the Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston University Medical Centre, but analysed people in the UK by looking at The Health Improvement Network (THIN), an electronic database from GP's surgeries around the country.

They looked at 3.7million people aged 40 and over but excluded anyone already diagnosed with gout or dementia.

Analysis was carried out of Alzheimer's disease amongst adults with gout compared with up to five without it.

Overall, the researchers identified 309 new cases of Alzheimer's disease among 59,224 patients with gout.

And in their comparison group over a five-year follow-up period, they found 1,942 cases of Alzheimer's among 238,805 patients.

They concluded this shows there was a 24 per cent lower risk of Alzheimer's among people with a history of gout, after taking into account age, sex, body mass index, socio-economic status, lifestyle factors, prior heart conditions and use of heart drugs.

The report concluded: 'Our findings provide the first population-based evidence for the potential protective effect of gout on the risk of Alzheimer's disease and support the purported neuroprotective role of uric acid.

'If confirmed by future studies, a therapeutic investigation that has been employed to prevent progression of Parkinson’s disease may be warranted for this relatively common and devastating condition.'

Last year it emerged that the number of people suffering from gout is on the rise, with hospital admissions for the painful condition rising by a fifth over the last five years in England.

Associated with a diet rich in purines such as red meat, seafood and beer, the most common symptom is a sudden and severe pain in the joint along with swelling and redness.

Men are most commonly affected, and other factors that increase a person’s risk include their age, being overweight or obese or having high blood pressure or diabetes.

The full report is published online in the Annals Of The Rheumatic Diseases.

Gout is a type of arthritis, which causes sudden and severe pain in joints, along with swelling and redness.

It usually affects the joint of the big toe but it can develop in any joint.

The condition is caused when crystals of sodium urate form inside and around the joint causing them to swell.

It is often associated with a diet rich in food containing purines, such as red meat, seafood and beer.

Men are most commonly affected, and other factors that increase a person’s risk include their age, being overweight or obese or having high blood pressure or diabetes.

It is often referred to as the disease of kings due to Henry VIII famously suffering from it.
