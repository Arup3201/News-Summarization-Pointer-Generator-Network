An elderly British couple have been knocked down and killed in America whilst trying to cross a five lane freeway in America to reach a roadside diner.

Edward McElroy, 76, and his 70-year old wife Brenda were thought to have been walking hand-in-hand when they were hit by a pick-up truck - just 24 hours after they arrived in the US for a last-minute 'fly drive' holiday.

A nurse attempted to give first aid to the couple, but both were pronounced dead at the scene having been killed instantly.

Tragedy: Brenda and Edward McElroy from Blackpool, Lancashire, who have been killed in a horror crash while on holiday in America

Retired loss adjuster Mr McElroy, known as Ted, and his wife, a former customer services advisor, had travelled to West Virginia where ‘leaf peepers’ were visiting to marvel at the changing colours of the tree-filled landscapes in Autumn.

The couple, from Blackpool, Lancashire, who have three children and three grandchildren, booked into a Best Western hotel in Barboursville and tragedy struck as they were crossing the road to get to a restaurant which had been recommended to them.

Their eldest daughter Gillian, 49, has now flown to the US to arrange for the bodies to be repatriated back to England.

On Monday Mrs McElroy's sister Eileen Dobson, 65, said: ‘We're all devastated and so sad especially after we saw them only last week for Ted's birthday.

‘They were so excited and were telling us about the trip. I asked if they were looking forward to it and they said they couldn't wait. It's heart-breaking - they were so full of life.’

She added: ‘Ted and Brenda had initially booked a holiday to go and stay with a friend in Kentucky but they couldn't go because the friend had a stroke and wasn't well enough to put them up.

‘When they came to try and change the flight it was going to cost them a lot of money so they booked a fly/drive holiday. It was a last-minute decision. They were planning to go all the way across West Virginia.

Heart-breaking: The couple were described as being 'so full of life'

‘I didn't want them to go at all. Instead of rebooking those flights where you don't know where you're going I thought they should have gone to Cornwall and I just felt it was jinxed from the start.

‘But they loved America and were determined to go. They did everything together.’

‘Personally I can't believe they've essentially crossed a motorway in the dark. Normally they're sensible people who are always so aware of their surroundings so I just can't understand what's happened.

‘It was a five-lane freeway. Apparently it is a notoriously dangerous place to cross and local residents were campaigning to get lights put there.

‘You just wouldn't cross a motorway here so why do it in America.’Mr and Mrs McElroy were seasoned travellers, visiting several parts of the world.

The couple originally met at a yacht club and later married in Canada. He worked across the world as a loss adjuster in locations as diverse as London, Nigeria and Canada.

Later in his career, Mr McElroy, a model railway enthusiast, was employed as a civil servant for the Department of Work and Pensions. The couple were members of a crown green bowling club and were involved in amateur dramatics.

Mrs Dobson added: ‘Brenda and Ted used to like doing different things and liked visiting friends and making friends. They were very outgoing.

Keen travellers: The couple had arrived in Barboursville on a last-minute fly-drive holiday

‘They loved socialising and entertaining and they always had two holidays a year. They had done the Great Wall of China and went on a cruise round Norway this Spring.

‘They had only just got to Barboursville when it happened. They set off at 6am from Manchester to West Virginia so I would think that they didn't get there until late at night, so they couldn't have done much because they would have just got there and picked up a car. They would have been very tired and they may have had a glass of wine.

‘Their advanced ages were on my mind when they said they were going there. I know how tiring a long-haul journey like that is.

‘I said it's such a long way and I asked if they were sure about it. I wanted them to stay in this country but they were so used to going out on these exotic holidays.

‘She said this would be the last holiday and it just shows you have to be careful what you say because it was their last one.

The crash happened at 8.15pm local time on Tuesday of last week. The manager of the Best Western motel, where the couple were staying, was reported to have said the McElroys had gone to the front desk minutes before the accident to ask where they could go for dinner.

The eastbound lanes of the road - known as Route 60 - were closed for several hours while police and ambulance crews attended the scene.

The driver of the pick-up truck - a 56-year-old woman - was treated for shock in hospital after the incident. Police said there were no charges pending against the driver.

The mayor of Barboursville, Paul Turman, said he would talk to the department of highways to see if any lessons could be learned from the tragedy.

He said: ‘One thing that has come up that would be helpful is to try and help with the lighting in the area. It's unfortunate and we are saddened by it.’

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘We are aware of the deaths of Edward and Brenda McElroy in the US. We are in contact and are providing consular assistance.’

West Virginia is a popular tourist destination in September and October for ‘leaf peepers’, who visit to marvel at the changing colours of the tree-filled landscapes in Autumn.

Nearly 80 per cent of West Virginia is covered in trees and ‘fall driving tours’ are a popular tourist attraction.

The trips are so popular that the West Virginia Division of Forestry provides weekly ‘fall foliage reports’, which includes maps of autumn colour by county and a ‘foliage colouration guide’ by tree species.
