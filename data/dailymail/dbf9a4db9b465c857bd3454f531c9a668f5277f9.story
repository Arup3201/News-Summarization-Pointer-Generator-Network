With its sinister dim lighting, map floor and huddled centre seating, it looks more like a James Bond secret lair than a Cabinet meeting.

But the room - complete with a domed roof and suspended overhead screens - is in fact a conference facility at Leeds Museum, and the attendees, a group of ministers.

And pictured deep in conversation, Prime Minister David Cameron was not discussing a covert wicked plot, but instead the country's HS2 high-speed rail link.

The map of Leeds on the floor was 
remarkably similar to that used by evil villain Goldfinger to show his 
mobsters his plan to obliterate the world economy.

And while Cameron was not wielding a stick, and did not have to fight off James Bond, he did face an attack from those opposed to his plans.

He faced a backlash from 
Conservative MPs opposed to the high-speed rail link as the 
Government published draft plans to extend the line to the north of 
England.

The Prime Minister 
said extending the already-planned London to Birmingham HS2 line as far 
as Manchester and Leeds would 'spread wealth and prosperity' around the 
country.

But campaigners 
denounced the scheme as 'fundamentally flawed' and Transport Secretary 
Patrick McLoughlin faced anger from senior backbenchers as he outlined 
the preferred route in the House of Commons.

Labour said it was a 'major error' to put off a decision on a proposed spur to Heathrow pending the results of Sir Howard Davies' review of future airport capacity, which is not due to give its final report until the summer of 2015.

The second phase of HS2 envisages five stops on a 211-mile Y-shaped extension northwards from Birmingham - scheduled to be completed in 2032, six years after the first phase.

There
will also be a 'dedicated link' alongside the high-speed line at Crewe 
to link up with standard trains - reducing journey times to Liverpool 
and Glasgow.

Officials say 
the Â£32.7billion project will create at least 100,000 jobs and would 
cut the journey time from Manchester to Birmingham to 41 minutes, and 
from Manchester to London to one hour eight minutes - almost half the 
present times.

Talks: Cameron told a Cabinet meeting that the high-speed rail would 'radically reduce journey times' and was 'a vital part of economic regeneration and the future of our country'

Leeds will be
57 minutes away from Birmingham compared to one hour 58 minutes today, 
and one hour 22 minutes away from London Euston, down from two hours 12 
minutes, according to Department for Transport projections.

The
move was widely welcomed by businesses, which called on the Government 
to follow it up with funding for further infrastructure links within the
regions.

But critics 
suggested that siting the Sheffield stop outside the city centre and 
locating the east Midlands station between Derby and Nottingham meant 
that much of the benefit of shorter travel times would be lost as 
passengers switch to slower local services for the final leg of their 
journey.

Mr Cameron told the 
Cabinet meeting in Leeds that high-speed rail would 'radically reduce 
journey times' and was 'a vital part of economic regeneration and the 
future of our country'.

He 
indicated he was determined to withstand pressure for a U-turn, telling 
Sky News: 'This is going to happen. I have been a strong supporter right
from the start.'
