The Muslim ex-husband of American woman Nicole Lynn Mansfield, shot dead in Syria for supposedly fighting with rebel forces, is a religious hardliner who may have indoctrinated her into his beliefs.

Ayman Mohammed Bafil, from Saudi Arabia, hates the freedoms that people have in the U.S. and thinks anyone who does not believe in Islam is ‘going to hell’.

A close family friend said that he has medieval beliefs and sees women as only being fit for cooking, raising children and having sex.

The friend fears that he could have 
controlled Nicole Lynn Mansfield, killed by government forces in Syria 
last Sunday.

The claims, made exclusively to 
MailOnline, give an insight into the man Nicole’s family 
believe could have set her on the course which resulted in her death.

MailOnline has also obtained the 
first picture of Bafil, who now lives in Saudi Arabia with his third 
wife, an American Muslim convert like Nicole.

The photo, reportedly taken in 2007, shows a man in traditional Saudi dress with a slim face and youthful appearance.

Nicole, 33, and two other Westerners 
were shot dead in Idlib province in northern Syria, making her the first
 American to be killed in the country’s civil war.

State media reported that she was 
fighting with an al Qaeda-affiliated group and that she threw grenades 
at government soldiers when caught in an ambush.

Other reports suggested she was setting up an observation post when she was shot.

Her
 family, including her 18-year-old daughter Triana Jones, who all live 
in Flint, Michigan, are baffled as to how an apparently harmless woman 
could have ended up in such a situation.

The
 turning point in her life appears to have been five years ago when she 
met Bafil and converted to Islam, though it is not clear if he 
introduced her to the religion or if she was already interested in 
becoming a Muslim.

Now 
MailOnline can reveal his full story for the first time - and how he has
 been married three times in his quest to find the perfect housewife.

Bafil,
 32, wed his first wife in Saudi Arabia in 2002 under an arranged 
marriage to a Saudi woman. Both were from strict Sunni Muslim families.

They
 moved to Eugene, Oregon in 2006 so he could study English and then 
engineering with a grant from the Saudi government which covered his 
tuition fees, accommodation and living expenses.

However his wife soon grew unhappy and rebelled at how she was treated. In 2007 they split up and later divorced.

The friend said: ‘He carried on as if they were still in Saudi Arabia. He is very religious and didn’t allow her to get cable or to play music.

‘He did not let her drive - even in America - and the only way she could was by stealing his car when he didn’t know.

‘He hated Christianity and people who were not in the same religion as him.

‘His wife was supposed to wear the full burka. He thought a woman should be at home, cooking, watching the kids and there for sex. That’s what a woman is in his eyes.’

Bafil and his first wife have two children, a girl aged nine and a five-year-old boy.

They went through a bitter court battle which ended with her being granted custody but he is allowed visitation rights when he returns to the U.S. He does so once or twice a year even though he reportedly detests America.

The friend said: ‘He is completely against America. He thinks there’s too much freedom here. He thinks young people who have sex are like animals and he doesn’t like drinking.

‘The bottom line is that he thinks they (Americans) will burn in hell’.

In July 2010, Bafil married Nicole in Flint having met her on the Internet but their marriage lasted just over a year. They divorced in August 2011.

Her relatives have told MailOnline that it was a ‘deal’ under which he would get a green card and paid her cash and gave her a van in exchange.

Daughter: Triana Lynn Mansfield, right, took to Facebook on Friday to blame the Syrian government for her mother's death while denying her accused ties to terrorism

But for Nicole at least it seems that there was definitely a commitment of some kind, regardless of her motives.

The friend said: ‘She came to visit him every weekend and do the wife thing and cook and clean for him.

‘Then she would go back home and carry on her life. She paid for everything and just wanted to be there for him.

‘She would be a housewife for him, basically’.

It is not clear if Nicole was already a Muslim before she met Bafil or if he persuaded her to convert, although in Islam converting a non-believer is seen as extremely praiseworthy.

Regardless of which, it is likely that he brought her round to his militant viewpoint during their time together.

The friend said that he was ‘capable of putting ideas into her head’ and that he was supportive of Muslims who had taken part in jihad against the Russians in Afghanistan in the 1980s with the backing of the Saudi government.

The friend said: ‘He is capable of doing anything. He is manipulative and two-faced.'

By October 2011, Bafil moved onto wife number three and wed Muslim convert Theresa Rutgers, who was 33 at the time and living in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Defense: Nicole's daughter Triana Lynn Mansfield took to Facebook today to defend her mother, pictured, claiming she was a 'regular American woman who was misguided by the people'

The pair are now living in Saudi Arabia where he works as an engineer for Saudi Airlines and she is a stay-at-home mother.

She has told friends she is extremely happy and loves her new life.

During a phone conversation, Theresa, who was not aware that Nicole had died, said: ‘That’s awful news. I’m so sorry.

‘Ayman never has a bad thing to say about her. I knew they were married but it was not a bitter divorce.'

MailOnline has not received a comment from Ayman Mohammed Bafil.

Among those who have defended Nicole's actions have been her daughter Triana who has given a tearful interview in which she said that her mother was ‘lied to’ by whoever persuaded her to go to Syria.

She claimed that her mother could not have afforded her plane ticket and that she told her last week that she wouldn't be home for a few weeks because someone stole her ID.

That same ID, her Michigan state driver’s licence, was later flashed on TV screens when she was killed.

Nicole’s father Greg Mansfield revealed that he contacted the FBI five years ago when Nicole traveled to Dubai and asked them to take away her passport.

He has said that he ‘knew something wasn’t right’ and that if they had followed his instructions she would still be alive.

Nicole’s family now want her body returned to the U.S. so they can give her a Christian burial and bury her in a plot next to her grandfather.

Today the Sunday Telegraph reported the group that Nicole was fighting with is called Ahrar al-Sham, translated as ‘Free Men of Syria’, which controls a large area in the north of the country.

A rebel fighter who declined to give his name said that Nicole was not a terrorist and that she was helping to plan operations against government forces and nurse wounded fighters.

He said: ‘The American sister, Nicole, is a brilliant woman.

‘She was an instructor for our movement. She gave training to other women who wanted help.

‘When she died, she was on a mission planning and studying the military geography of an army base.
