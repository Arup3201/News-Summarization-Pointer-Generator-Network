Burnley boss Sean Dyche insists his side have the character to bounce back from their growing streak of disappointments and beat the odds by securing Barclays Premier League survival.

The Clarets go in search of their first top-flight win at their ninth attempt against Everton at Turf Moor on Sunday.

A second-half lapse cost his men dear against West Ham last week but Dyche is adamant there is still the desire within his camp to turn things round.

 Dyche said: "We are having to learn as we go.

"There is no doubting the players' physical power, their energy, their endeavour and belief - but it comes down to quality and awareness and experience.

"We haven't got a very experienced Premier League squad and we have had some tough lessons already.

"We believe this group is honest enough to keep learning and not be broken by it. You just get dented and you take the knocks and come off the ropes and get ready to take it again.

"We hope to use that mentality wisely over the season and the next step is to use it to learn how to win."

It has been a tough season already for Burnley supporters, whose side are nineteenth in the Premier League

Dyche hopes midfielder Dean Marney will be fit to return after missing three games with a hamstring injury while Steven Reid is also pushing for a recall.

Despite Everton's inconsistent start to the season and a midweek trip to France in the UEFA Europa League, Dyche is under no illusions about the difficulties of finally claiming a three-point haul on Sunday.

Dyche added: "They have had an indifferent start to the season by their standards but they are a great club with a great manager and these are the kinds of challenges we wanted last year.

"The players want it and the town wants it. We have gone up to a different level and we are creating chances. it is all about delivering that cutting edge that we know is there."
