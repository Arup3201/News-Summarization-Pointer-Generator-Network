Police are on the hunt for a thief who bears a striking resemblance to the popular children's character Burglar Bill.

Wearing a distinctive dark blue and white striped jersey with a black woolly hat and gloves, this burglar is a real-life doppelganger for the cartoon crook.

The cartoon villain, who appeared in the popular book series by Janet and Allan Ahlberg, was best known for his stripy jumper and his catchphrase: 'I'll 'ave that!'

CCTV footage: The thief and an unknown accomplice stole two cameras and Xbox controllers from Waitrose in Southend, Essex, on Christmas EveÂ 

And this real-life thief, dressed in his stereotypical burglar attire, obviously adopted the catchpharse for himself when he popped into a Waitrose store.

The thief and an accomplice - who was dressed in a far less eye-catching black hooded top - were captured stealing two cameras and Xbox controllers from Waitrose in Southend, Essex, on Christmas Eve.

One staff member at Waitrose commented: 'It is quite comical to see the similarity between this guy and Burglar Bill.

'You would have thought he would wear something less conspicuous when breaking into the store.'

The children's book, published by 
Penguin from 1977 to 1999, followed Bill as he snuck down dimly-lit streets, 
climbed up walls and crept into houses through unlocked windows to steal
food and goods completely undetected.

His life is then turned around when he accidentally steals a baby who helps him turn over a new leaf. 
The book remains a children's classic and can still be ordered online.

Police today released CCTV images in the hope someone will recognise 'Bill' and his accomplice.

Anyone with information in relation to the burglary, which took place on Christmas Eve last year 2012, should contact Detective Constable Paul Brown at Southend CID on 101 or via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
