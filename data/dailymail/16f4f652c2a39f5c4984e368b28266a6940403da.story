Millie Mackintosh is the golden girl of Made in Chelsea, almost as famous for her dewy glow and good looks as she is for her relationship with Professor Green.

And now you can achieve her look at home with a little help from make-up artist and YouTube sensation  Tanya Burr, a close friend of Millie's who has been doing the star's make-up for years and is frequently behind her glossy camera-ready look.

In a ten minute exclusive video with a simple step-by-step guide, Tanya works her magic on Millie, transforming her from girl next door to red carpet ready.

Before and after: Tanya transforms Millie's look from natural daytime to Christmas party ready

In the film, 23-year-old Tanya, whose YouTube videos get four million hits a month, explains how she plans to give Millie a glittery gold party eye and red lips.

She begins by removing Millie's make-up with Nelson's Pure and Clear facial wipes to 'cleanse the canvas' in preparation for the makeover.

She moisturises Millie's skin and explains that if you have oily skin, it is essential to use a primer before applying make-up.

The foundation of choice is Nars Sheer Glow Barcelona, which she applies with a brush and then blends in with her fingers, explaining that Millie 'loved it' on her skin the last time she used it.

'I use their tinted moisturiser in the day but I think that this is more of an evening look,' says Millie.

Tanya then uses a Tom Ford brow definer to sculpt Millie's eyebrows before applying Urban Decay Naked Palette eyeshadow.

'This is the perfect colour for Christmas parties. If you don't like going for a dark smoky eye,' explains Tanya, as she intensifies Millie's eye make-up with Clinique Liner in Intense Brown.

To sparkle up Millie's look, Tanya applies MAC's antique gold reflex glitter to her eyelid before sweeping Maybelline Volume Express Mascara over her lashes.

'And now for the really exciting part, we are going to use Millie's new Soho lashes, they are amazing,' says Tanya.

'These are perfect for the party look, they give a really sexy feline look,' adds Millie.

Tanya then uses Bobbi Brown Corrector in Light Peach to brighten up Millie's eyes and brushes Rimmel Stay Matte Powder over the centre of her skin before sweeping NARS Laguna Bronzer into the hollows of Millie's cheek bones.

To create Millie's sexy red lips, Tanya uses MAC Brick Lipliner to help the Kate Moss Rimmel Kiss Of Life Lipstick lipstick last longer.

'Millie is now looking absolutely gorgeous like she is going to a Christmas party,' says Tanya.

Millie adds: 'I love it, you have 
made my skin look absolutely flawless, it's a little more coverage than I
 would usually wear but I think it really suits the look, it really ties
 it all together.

'I love the bright red lips, it's an amazing party red and I love the texture of it, especially with the amazing glittery eyes.'

Tanya Burr is a 23 year old make-up artist, fashion and beauty blogger and YouTube beauty guru phenomenon.

She
 has trained with and assisted some of the UK's top make up artists and 
also worked for Laura Mercier and Clinique where she learned a lot about
 make-up, skincare and the industry.

She made her name by setting up a YouTube channel and posting
 regular make-up tutorials online, with the help of her boyfriend's 
sisters Sam and Nic. She would record videos after getting
 back from her job on the beauty counter in a department store.

Now she runs a highly successful YouTube channel delivering tutorials and beauty guidance to thousands of viewers every day.

Her channel attracts over four 
million people a month looking for beauty tips - and her young audience is so hungry for her advice that many even cry when they meet her.

Tanya
 keeps up to speed with current trends, attending and working behind the
 scenes at London Fashion Week and says she 'can't wait' to get home 
afterwards to write up all the trends.

Skills: Tanya can recreate any celebrity look for her fans, here she does Cara Delevingne

However,
 while her job now takes her to celebrity parties from London to Dubai, 
the homebird insists that she will never leave her quaint barn 
conversion in Bramerton, near Norwich, for the bright lights of a big 
city.

'I
 am still so flattered that people like me enough to watch me every day 
and it makes doing the videos so rewarding,' said Tanya.

Despite
 the firm grounding she has in her local roots, Miss Burr is no longer 
just a make-up artist, but a trend-setter too.

Even the clothes and 
accessories Miss Burr wears are closely observed. A Mulberry handbag she
 recently showed off saw the Mulberry website bombarded by a massive 
surge in hits. As a result thrilled Tanya was invited to the Mulberry 
fashion show and after party.

'I
 get to do such amazing things. But I really want to remain someone 
people can relate to and my tutorials professional and full of 
instructions,' she said.

'The most important thing is to give viewers what they want and to keep the videos unique and professional.'
