Jerry Monerville, convicted of a violent robbery, went on the run from Hollesley Bay open prison near Ipswich, Suffolk this week

A police force have come under fire for delays in telling the public that a violent criminal was on the run following the third escape in the area in three years.

Elected police chief Tim Passmore hit out after Suffolk Police took nearly 20 hours to tell locals that Jerry Monerville had absconded from Hollesley Bay open prison near Ipswich.

Monerville, 49, originally of Islington, north London, was serving an eight-year jail sentence for twice slashing the face of a 15-year-old Asian boy in Bethnal Green, east London, in November 2010.

He failed to return to the notoriously insecure open prison - which has been dubbed Holiday Bay by inmates - by 3.30pm on Tuesday after being given leave to go to London last Friday.

Police were informed the prisoner was missing from the jail at about 5.30pm on Tuesday but only told the public and media at 12.55pm on Wednesday.

Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner Mr Passmore said he would be challenging Suffolk Chief Constable Douglas Paxton about the embarrassing blunder.

He said: 'I was given an assurance by the Deputy Chief Constable last July that communications to the public in these situations would be reviewed.

'Clearly this is not working and that is completely unsatisfactory.

'I will now take this up with the Chief Constable again and seek a cast-iron guarantee that such public information is released without delay.

'My understanding is that the information was not released for 19 hours and this does not help maintain public trust and confidence in the criminal justice system.'

Monerville twice slashed a teenager's face before 
launching a racist tirade, his 2011 sentencing hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court, east 
London, heard.

Monerville
 and his accomplice Shane Doyle, 26, ambushed the teenager from behind 
on November 21, 2010 and punched him in the face and kicked him before the boy's mobile phone was taken.

Monerville knocked the boy to the ground and pinned him down before slicing open his cheek in the terrifying late-night attack.

It is the second escape from Hollesley Bay open prison - which has been dubbed Holiday Bay by inmates - in two years

The pair tried to flee but were arrested just yards away after a passer-by heard the boy's screams.

They
 admitted robbery and causing grievous bodily harm, but claimed they 
were drunk at the time. Doyle, from east London, was jailed for seven 
years.

Commenting on Monerville's escape, a Suffolk 
Police spokesman said yesterday: 'Suffolk Police were contacted by HMP 
Hollesley Bay just after 5.30pm yesterday (Tue) reporting that Jerry 
Monerville had failed to return to the prison.

'Overnight we carried out initial enquiries including liaising with other forces to check known addresses.

Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore has slammed the county's police over 20-hour delays to warning the public Monerville was on the loose

'We
 were not able to locate Monerville and therefore a media appeal was 
requested this morning. The safety of the public is our priority at all 
times and is our first consideration.'

The spokesman said Monerville should not be approached and appealed for anyone who knows his whereabouts to contact them.

The latest escape in Suffolk comes after it took the county's police nearly 20 hours to warn residents that kidnapper Daniel Best was at large after he disappeared from Hollesley Bay last July.

Best, 25, had been described by a judge as a 'danger to society' after abducting his ex-girlfriend in Ipswich in 2007. He failed to attend a roll call at Hollesley Bay on July 5.

Police were notified at 8pm, but only put out an appeal to find Best just after 3.30pm the following day. Best was later recaptured

After a meeting with the chief and deputy constables, Mr Passmore said at the time: 'The Constabulary accepts that the information could have been released at an earlier stage - and, as a result, we will be reviewing our processes.'

Deputy Chief Constable Paul Marshall said then: 'In this particular case, an assessment carried out after liaising with the prison service concluded that the risk to the public from Daniel Best is low.

'At the same time, there were a number of sensitive inquiries which needed to be carried out as a priority.'

In October 2011, the police force delayed warning the public that three violent criminals had escaped from a secure hospital in Suffolk.

It took officers 11 hours to put out a warning that Luke Sparks, 21, Ross Beeby, 22, and Jason Williams, 21,had escaped from St John's House in Palgrave, near Diss. The trio were all recaptured after a huge search.
