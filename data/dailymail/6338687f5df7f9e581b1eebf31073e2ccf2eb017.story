Beatles fans with very deep pockets are being given the chance to own the house where John Lennon wrote some of the band's most famous songs.

The beautiful mock Tudor mansion in Weybridge, Surrey, was home to Lennon and his first wife Cynthia between 1964 and 1968.

The 1920s era estate boasts six bedrooms, a swimming pool, 1.5 acres of well-manicured, landscaped garden and a £15 million price-tag.

Kenwood: John Lennon's former home in Weybridge, Surrey

Sprawling: The estate boasts 1.5 acres of 'well-manicured, landscaped gardens'

Good neighbourhood: Kenwood was a stone's throw from Ringo Starr and George's Harrison's country piles

The property, named Kenwood, is described by estate agents Knight Frank as a 'luxuriously finished family home'.

Happy couple: John Lennon with his first wife Cynthia, with whom he bought Kenwood

Originally called the Brown House, it
 was designed by architect T.A. Allen, and built in 1913 by local 
builders, Love & Sons.

It was re-named former owner by Ken Wood, founder of the famous 
food mixer company, when he owned the property.

John Lennon bought the house for £20,000 on July 15th, 1964, on the advice of The Beatles’ 
accountants, Dr. Walter Strach, and James Isherwood.

Cliff Richard and 
Tom Jones had earlier bought homes on the St George’s Hill estate.

It's also close to Sunny Heights, 
the former home of Ringo Starr, and a short drive from Kinfauns, George 
Harrison’s former home in Esher.

During his time there, Lennon wrote a number of tracks for The Beatles' Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album.

The house features also in scenes from a home movie which featured in the film Imagine: John Lennon.

According to music legend, the rock icon spent 
several days in the house taking drug LSD before proclaiming himself the
 reincarnation of Jesus Christ to the rest of the Beatles.

Lennon met Yoko Ono while living at Kenwood, which contributed to the downfall of his marriage to Cynthia.

It's has been claimed Cynthia returned from a holiday to Greece and 
discovered her husband and Ono in a compromising position and under the 
influence of drugs.

Luxurious: The indoor pool is a more recent addition. In Lennon's time the swimming pool was outdoors

Bargain: Lennon bought the house for £20,000 and sold it for £40,000

Though he reportedly regarded Kenwood as a 'stop-over' on the way to something better, Lennon spent twice the original 
£20,000 purchase price on renovations, reducing its 22 rooms to 17, 
landscaping the grounds and building an outdoor swimming pool.

Much of the initial decoration was 
left to interior designer Kenneth Partridge, whom Lennon employed after 
being impressed by his design work at a lavish party held by Beatles’ 
manager Brian Epstein to celebrate the Beatles’ departure for their 
first tour of the USA.

However, when Partridge had completed
 his work, Lennon and then-wife Cynthia immediately made a number of 
further alterations and Cynthia’s mother was given an allowance to fill 
the shelves of the house with antiques and antiquarian books, and a 
heavy sliding wooden door was installed at the gate entrance to keep out
 fans.

All in the name: The house was named Kenwood by a former owner, the founder of the Kenwood food mixer company

Kenwood has three floors and on the 
ground floor during the Lennon period the front door opened on to an 
entrance hall, where he placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit.

The
 sun room was filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a 
Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to 
mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbituates and LSD.

There was also a yellow sofa or 
chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a 
present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (nee Stanley) also known as Mimi.

Behind the sunroom was the split-level
 kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex 
that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.

Drugs: Lennon reportedly spent several days in the house taking drug LSD before proclaiming himself the reincarnation of Jesus Christ to the rest of the Beatles

Rising prices: The house has changed hands several times since lennon sold it. It was last sold in 2007 for £5.8 million

The house had six bedrooms, with five on the first floor. The giant master bedroom featured a huge double bed, white carpets and an en-suite bathroom complete with sunken bathtub, shower, Jacuzzi and ‘his and hers’ wash basins.

Lennon wanted the guest bedrooms to contain works of art by students of the Liverpool Art College. In particular, two drawings by former Beatles’ bassist Stuart Sutcliffe were hung, for what Lennon described as 'sentimental reasons'.

The first floor also had a study. On the top floor was the attic, which Lennon claimed as his own, painting the ceiling one bright colour, then changing to another when the paint ran out, and installing most of his musical equipment there.

Lennon moved out of the house after his split from Cynthia and it was sold for £40,000 to Bill Martin, writer of songs such as 'Puppet on a String' and 'Congratulations'.

It’s changed hands several times since then, and last went on the market, with an asking price of £5.95 million, in 2006 and was sold in January 2007 for £5.8 million.
