Oscar Garcia's reign as Watford head coach has come to an abrupt end following health concerns, with the club confirming Billy McKinlay has taken over. 

The former Fulham assistant, 45, has stepped in as Garcia stepped down after a sustained period of time in hospital over the past fortnight.

The Spaniard was released from hospital last Sunday after undergoing tests on his heart and was at Watford's game against Blackburn on Saturday, albeit watching from the directors' box.

McKinlay was brought in as first team coach last week and the latest developments mark a sad end for Garcia after such promise when he arrived in August. 

'I was closely involved with the appointment of Billy McKinlay, because I was aware that I may not be able to return,' Garcia said.

'I always wanted an experienced British coach within our set-up, because it's important to have that mix of cultures and experience with this squad.

'I would like to thank Watford's fans for their kindness during my time here at the club. I will be hoping to see you all as a Premier League club next season.' 

Hornets' CEO Scott Duxbury added: 'Everyone feels it is important that there is continuity in the coaching structure. Ruben Martinez and Javier Pereira will therefore continue as Billy McKinlay's assistants.

'We appreciate Oscar's candour in placing the best interest of Watford FC ahead of his own personal thoughts and we wish him well for his future in football.

'In Billy McKinlay, we have someone with the qualities and significant experience to build further on the foundations already laid for a successful season ahead.'

Garcia, who only took over at Vicarage Road just over three weeks ago, has  missed the Hornets' 1-0 win at Blackpool and last Saturday's 1-1 draw against Bournemouth, which should have been his first home match in charge.

McKinlay was close to being appointed Blackburn manager two years ago but Rovers' global adviser Shebby Singh was warned to change his mind by supporters who protested against the plan.
