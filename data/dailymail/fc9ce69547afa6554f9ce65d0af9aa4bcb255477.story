Two con artists posed as a high-flying couple looking for a new home so they could find empty luxury accommodation to squat in, a court heard today. 

Married Richard and Hazel Jerome are accused of using the elaborate ruse to find out which high-value properties around the UK were sitting empty so they could move in quickly and live there rent free until they were forced out.

A jury was today told how the couple had already been convicted for a similar stunt in Cambridgeshire when they decided to embark on another property scam in Devon - changing their names so sellers wouldn't read about them in the press.

The Jeromes, of Chacombe, Oxon, are now on trial at Exeter Crown Court where they have denied eight fraud charges.

Con artists: Richard and Hazel Jerome, who were convicted of fraud in 2009 after posing as a rich couple looking for a new home so they could find empty properties to squat in, are accused of carrying out the same scam in a different part of Britain

Prosecutor Peter Combe told the jury: 'The two defendants are habitual confidence tricksters.'

He said they have developed a ruse where they pose as rich cash buyers of upmarket properties and end up living in them rent free until they are eventually forced out.

He said: 'They pose as a wealthy couple who are interested in buying expensive properties.'

He said 65-year-old Richard Jerome, known as Rick, pretends to have ‘substantial business interests abroad’ while his wife, 63-year-old Hazel, is a retired schoolteacher.

The jury was told how the couple have already been convicted for carrying out incredibly similar housing fraud after a court case held at Huntingdon Crown Court in 2009.

The court heard how after posing as a wealthy couple, they made cash offers on two expensive houses which were on sale with vacant possession.

Then they would spin tales and lies as they explained delays in the house purchase - and ask to rent in the interim but never handed over any money.

The Jeromes have previously been convicted for living rent-free in this house Bradville Milton Keynes for a year

The jury heard that one couple from this previous scam lost £167,000 on the value of the property and unpaid bills and rent.

Jerome
was jailed for 15 months after he admitted fraud and deception while 
his wife was given a ten month suspended term after she too admitted 
fraud.

Mr Combe said they used the same methods when they turned their attention to the West country.

The court heard that in East Looe, 
Cornwall, the Jeromes claimed they wanted to buy a house for their base 
in the UK because they lived for six months each year in Barbados.

They made an offer of £310,000 on the property but then blamed delays on Jerome being seriously ill and his recuperation.

But Mr Combe said when they made that offer they had already pleaded not guilty to the frauds in the Huntington case.

The prosecutor said it was ‘somewhat surprising’ they could splash out £310,000 on the house when they had three county court judgements against them for various sums of money.

He said the Jeromes ‘work together’ and Rich Jerome ‘takes the lead and does the talking’ but Hazel Jerome plays her part as they tell vendors about their ‘fantastical lifestyle’.

The court heard the purchase of the Cornish house was still going on when the couple later admitted the fraud in Huntingdon crown court.

The seller then read about the Jeromes' fiddle in newspapers and baled out without losing too much money on the deal.

The Jeromes then turned their attention to another property in Sidmouth, Devon - one on a cliff top with lovely sea views.

But this time they allegedly used a false surname - Ausson - so the seller wouldn't hear of the court case.

They again posed as a wealthy couple with international business interests with a cash deal for the £750,000 property - not long after Jerome had been released from jail.

The court heard they wanted to complete the deal in two and a half weeks but then made another series of excuses for delays and problems blaming solicitors and illness.

But a surveyor they used and failed to pay for his work discovered their real identities and alerted the various parties and the police became involved again.

The Jeromes were arrested at their home. Jerome questioned why police wanted his passport saying that he had not been abroad for two years - despite telling vendors that he was a high flier travelling around the world constantly.

Police also recovered bank statements which showed he never had more than £200 in his account.

He refused to comment in police interviews while his wife denied being involved in any fraud and said she lived off her State pension and her school teacher pension.

She said they had looked to buy a retirement home in the West country for £300,000 or more and was told by her husband that his off shore company would making the purchase.

The court was also told how private school headteacher Diane Gardner was duped into handing Jerome £10,000 after meeting him through a dating website.

Miss Gardner, from Camberley, Surrey, said: 'He told me that he was divorced. He said he worked in the money markets and said that he had been in the RAF and worked for Rank Zerox all around the world.'

She said they first met on line in 2003 but they only met in person six to eight times in five years. She said he told her he needed some money to finalise a deal and she ‘stupidly’ gave him £4,400.

She gave Jerome a further £5,000 to help her set up a mortgage - but she ended up doing it herself and never saw the cash again.

She called him ‘extremely plausible’ but she never got her money back even when she asked for it.

She told Exeter Crown Court: 'I loaned him a total in excess of £10,000 and got none of it back. It was probably more. I felt completely foolish.'

The Jeromes deny eight joint fraud charges in Cornwall, Devon and Northamptonshire.

The trial continues.
