Arsenal and Southampton are battling it out over a deal worth £1m for Newcastle keeper Freddie Woodman.

The England Under-19, who plays for the national team against France on Tuesday evening as they target a place in the European Championship finals, is one of the biggest prospects in the game.

Woodman, the 18-year-old who is the son of Newcastle’s keeper coach Andy Woodman, has already represented England at Under-16 and Under-17 level.

Arsenal and Saints are both looking to the future and Woodman, who is a regular in Newcastle’s Under-21 team, is on the wanted list.

Woodman, who has been on the bench for the first team, helped England win the Under-17 championships in Malta last summer.

Newcastle want Woodman to stay at St James’ Park, but the young keeper will be tempted by interest from other teams in the Barclays Premier League.

Arsenal and Saints, who have already put down their markers for the keeper, would allow Woodman out on loan next season to gain vital first team experience.
