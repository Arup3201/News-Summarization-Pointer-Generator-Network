Sales of scented candles are booming. Last year we spent £91.4 million on them, an increase of almost 14 per cent since 2011. But does a pricier product get you a longer-lasting and more fragrant candle, or are you literally burning money?

Fragrance expert Lawrence Roullier White says that, on the whole more expensive ingredients do make for better candles but also points out that some unscrupulous manufacturers have all sorts of tricks to save money and seduce you into thinking you’re buying a better quality product. ‘Some will just scent the top layer of the candle, or even the wick,’ he says.

But can even Lawrence’s expert ‘nose’ sniff out a cheap candle? We asked him to compare some high-priced candles with cheaper alternatives . . .

Marks Spencer White Grapefruit Scented Candle

Jo Malone Grapefruit Scented Candle

Marks & Spencer White Grapefruit Scented Candle, £15, marksandspencer.com. At least 60 per cent natural wax, burn-time up to 40 hours (38 p per hour).

Jo Malone Grapefruit Scented Candle, £39, jomalone.co.uk. Paraffin wax, up to 45 hours (87 p per hour).

Lawrence says: I instantly recognised the Jo Malone one. But, though the M&S one lacks the complexity, it’s not at all bad.

We say: Everyone loves Jo Malone, but for a fraction of the price, the M&S one is a good buy.BEST BUY: Cheaper, M&S.

Baldwins Eucalyptus Peppermint candle

Espa energising candle

Baldwins Eucalyptus & Peppermint, £6.99, baldwins.co.uk. Soy wax and beeswax, up to 15 hours (47p per hour).

Espa energising candle (with mint & eucalyptus), £21, espaskin care.com. Paraffin wax, up to 40 hours (53p per hour).

Lawrence says: While the Espa candle had a strong scent, the Baldwins one had a lovely eucalyptus hit. I could tell it was based on essential oils.

We say: At £6.99, the cheaper candle can’t be beaten. BEST BUY: Cheaper, Baldwins.

Tesco Glade Vanilla Sandalwood Candle

Neom Organics Serenity Home Candle Vanilla Sandalwood

Glade Vanilla & Sandalwood candle, £7, tesco.com. Paraffin wax, up to 30 hours (23p per hour).

Neom Organics Serenity Home Candle — Vanilla & Sandalwood, £39.50, neomorganics.com. Vegetable wax, up to 50 hours (79p per hour).

Lawrence says: You can tell the Neom one is scented with pure essential oils. Plus, having three wicks rather than one will help it burn more evenly. The Glade one smells sickly.

We say: We’d rather save up and buy the Neom one.

BEST BUY: Pricier, Neom.

St Eval Candle Company Sea Salt Candle

Jonathan Adler Sea Salt Candle

St Eval Candle Company Sea Salt Candle, £8.92, stevalcandle company.co.uk. Blended mineral wax, 45 hours (20p per hour).

Jonathan Adler Sea Salt Candle, £38,  jonathan adler.com. Paraffin wax, about 40 hours (95p per hour).

Lawrence says: I thought the St Eval candle was the more expensive one!

We say: The St Eval tin packaging, potent fragrance and rock-bottom price makes it our winner.

BEST BUY: Cheaper, St Eval.

Price's Candles Fresh Fig Jar

Daylesford Fig Scented Candle

Price’s Candles Fresh Fig Jar, £5.26, prices-candles.co.uk. Paraffin wax, 30 hours (18p per hour).

Daylesford Fig Scented Candle, £25, selfridges.com. A blend of non-GM rapeseed oil, no burn time given.

Lawrence says: The Price’s one smelled soapy. The vanilla I could smell takes away from its freshness.

We say: If you like a sweeter smell, the Price’s might be for you, but for perfume snobs it has to be the Daylesford one.

BEST BUY: Pricier, Daylesford.

BHS Cotton Co Sicilian Lemon with Mint candle

Urban Apothecary Sicilian Lemon

BHS Cotton & Co Sicilian Lemon with Mint, £8, bhs.co.uk. Natural wax, 38 hours (about 21p per hour).

Urban Apothecary Sicilian Lemon, £25, urban apothecarylondon.com. Natural soy wax, 12 hours (£2.08 per hour)

Lawrence says: The Urban Apothecary one has a stronger, almost sherberty lemon scent, while the mint in the BHS version gives it a mossy edge.

We say: For £25, the beautifully presented Urban Apothecary is a great gift. But if you’re not sold on sherbet lemons, the BHS one is just as good.

BEST BUY: It's a tie between the two

Yankee Candles White Gardenia Small Pillar, £9.95, yankee candle.co.uk. Paraffin wax, 35-45 hours (22p per hour)

Diptyque Gardenia Candle, £40, diptyqueparis.co.uk. Vegetable/paraffin wax mix, up to 60 hours (67p per hour)

Lawrence says: The cheaper one smells sugary, and the smell is less defined. The Diptyque wax looks creamy and even, while the Yankee Candle one is unnaturally white.

We say: Yankee gives an inexpensive sweeter scent. But for luxury and fragrance depth, Diptyque justifies its price.

BEST BUY: Pricier, Diptyque.
