Nick Gargan, the Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police, has been suspended while an investigation into a number of serious allegations that relate to inappropriate conduct towards female members of staff at the force takes place

A police chief has been suspended while claims of inappropriate behaviour towards female officers and staff are investigated.

A number of 'serious allegations' against Avon and Somerset Police chief constable Nick Gargan have been made, police and crime commissioner (PCC) Sue Mountstevens said.

Ms Mountstevens added that she had decided to suspend Mr Gargan, whom she appointed as chief constable in March last year, to 'protect the integrity of the investigation'.

She said: 'Following a number of serious allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards female officers and staff by the chief constable, Nick Gargan, I have decided to refer the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), who will now conduct an independent investigation.

'Due to the public interest in the case and to protect the integrity of the investigation, I have decided to suspend the chief constable while the independent investigation is carried out.'

A source familiar with the situation said: ‘It doesn’t really surprise me. He had an eye for the ladies, that’s for certain.’

The IPCC confirmed it has launched an independent investigation.

Ms Mountstevens added: 'Deputy Chief Constable John Long will act temporarily as Chief Constable and all officers and staff have been informed of this decision.

'I would like to assure the communities of Avon and Somerset that the Constabulary remains a high performing force.

'Both police officers and staff are committed to ensuring the area remains a safe place to live, work and visit.'

An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said: 'The matter has been referred to the IPCC by the Police and Crime Commissioner. It is not appropriate for us to comment any further.'

Mr Gargan, 47, who is dating a local BBC journalist, was apparently unaware of his impending suspension when he Tweeted Tommy Cooper gags at around midday today.

Mr Gargan posted a joke on Twitter this afternoon, just hours before his suspension was announced

He wrote: 'Stand by for a Tommy Cooper classic to celebrate a day with a rare few gaps on the diary......'

Two minutes later he tweeted: 'Police arrested 2 kids yesterday: one was drinking battery acid, the other was eating fireworks. They charged one & let the other off.'

Mr Gargan's policing career began in 1988 when he joined Leicestershire Constabulary and has a degree in French and Politics at the University of Leicester.

In 1995 he was seconded to the National Criminal Intelligence Service, working in Interpol and then in the British Embassy in Paris.

Mr Gargan worked extensively on the investigation into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales

He worked extensively on the investigation into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, eventually giving evidence at the Inquest into her death and the death of Mr Dodi Al Fayed.

He returned to Leicestershire in 1998 and rose through the ranks to become Chief Superintendent.

In April 2006 he joined Thames Valley Police as Assistant Chief Constable and led the roll-out of Neighbourhood Policing across the force.

Mr Gargan moved to the National Policing Improvement Agency at the beginning of 2010 and became its Chief Executive in the September of that year.

The Portishead HQ of Avon and Somerset police, where Gargan took the helm in 2013

He took over the top job at Avon and Somerset in 2013 with a basic salary of £148,159 per year and oversaw more than 5,000 police officers and staff. He was selected by the newly-elected Ms Mountstevens to replace his predecessor Colin Port.

Mr Port had decided not to re-apply for the position after Ms Mountstevens announced she would invite applications for the role rather than extending his contract.

He took her to the High Court in a failed bid to seek an injunction to block the interviews of candidates for the post of Chief Constable.

Mr Gargan was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in the New Year's Honours List 2012.

He is an avid supporter of Leicester City football club, where he is a season ticket holder and his other interests include running, cycling and opera.

The role nets him a basic salary of £148,159 per year and oversaw more than 5,000 police officers and staff.
