While Anna Windass was torn over her deal to have sex with a crooked business partner to help her family, the actor who plays her, Debbie Rush, says she'd have no similar qualms.

'I have three children and would do anything for them,' insists the married mum, 48. 'When you have kids you'd go to the ends of the earth for them.'

Corrie's version of Indecent Proposal - the 1993 hit movie in which Robert Redford paid $1 million for a night with married Demi Moore - is continuing to grip the nation: Anna's been left tormented after secretly sleeping with psychotic builder Pat Phelan.

Debbie says that if it meant helping her kids she would say yes to an Indecent Proposal

The villain has left Anna's partner Owen owing the bank Â£80,000 over a dodgy building deal and is also threatening to go to police after being attacked by her son Gary. Sleeping with Anna was his price to stop the harassment.

'It was sold to me as Indecent Proposal, only much less glamorous,' says Debbie. 'But whereas in the movie they do it out of greed, Anna doesn't want money, she just wants her family to be left alone.'

And while the Hollywood blockbuster had a happy ending, Corrie viewers can expect a different outcome for Anna and Owen.

Debbie's character is living a similar storyline to Demi Moore in Indecent Proposal

'Anna's desperate to hold the family together by keeping this a secret, but things never stay secret in soapland, and she's racked  by guilt. As the family unravels, the question will be, "Was it worth it?"'

It's a dream storyline for Debbie, who only started acting at the age of 35. She'd always wanted to be a performer but lost confidence after being bullied at school and credits her new career to husband Andrew.

The couple met while he worked as a chef in his father's hotel where Debbie was a cleaner.

'We fell madly in love. On our first date he took me to see the musical Oliver!,' she says. 'He made me feel confident enough to perform again - but then parenthood took over.'

Debbie admits using thoughts of their three grown-up kids to act this harrowing storyline - and draws on her own life to portray cash-strapped Anna. 'When my children were little I worked in Asda to make ends meet - sometimes 13 days in a row.'

It was the deaths of her dad Neil and stepdad Tom within six months of each other that prompted her to change her life. 'They were only in their 50s. I was nearly 30 and it made me think life was too short not to follow my dream,' says Debbie.

After juggling motherhood and amateur dramatics, then drama school - 'I did it in the evenings and it took five years. I still had to work in the day' - Debbie had roles in a Hollyoaks spin-off and the drama Shameless before joining Corrie in 2008.

And what of the future? 'On the Street I'm getting good storylines and working with people I adore, so we'll see. But I'm really ambitious. I believe if you focus you can do what you want in life. That's my motto.'
