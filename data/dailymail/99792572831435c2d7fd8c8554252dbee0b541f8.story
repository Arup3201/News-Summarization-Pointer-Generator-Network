Four teenagers were yesterday questioned on suspicion of murdering a former company director, who died after being knocked down by youths tearing along a seafront promenade on a ‘quadricycle’.

John Wilcock’s devastated wife Lynne released the last picture of the 65-year-old grandfather, taken moments before he was struck from behind by the rented pedal-powered vehicle.

The retired marine engineer, who had been battling cancer, was discharged after hospital treatment but died six days later.

Mrs Wilcock said her husband leaves behind three sons and two grandchildren.

Detectives questioned four teenagers – two aged just 15 – on suspicion of murdering Mr Wilcock after witnesses said the four-wheeled bike had been driven antisocially along the promenade at New Brighton on the Wirral. They were later released on bail.

Officers previously released a CCTV image of four teenagers said to have been acting anti-socially on the quadricycle in a bid to trace them.

Detective Inspector John Griffith, from Wirral CID, said: ‘We are carrying out a thorough investigation into what happened on New Brighton prom involving the people on board this quadricycle and the gentleman who sadly subsequently died.

‘A number of passers-by went to this man’s aid after he had been knocked over and I would also encourage those people to also contact the police as they may have information important to this case.’

It is understood the Wilcocks were walking their two boxer dogs along the pedestrian promenade, between Bubbles play centre and Home Bargains, when the blue quadricycle came up behind them.

The youths were earlier spotted riding and acting aggressively towards other people, according to witnesses.

The quadricycle struck Mr Wilcock, knocking him to the floor. The group stopped momentarily and got back onto the quadricycle and left the scene in the direction of Fort Perch Rock.

He was taken to hospital with swelling, bruising and head trauma before being discharged back to his home in West Derby, Liverpool.

But two days later Mr Wilcock was readmitted after his condition deteriorated, and he died in the early hours of Monday morning.

DI Griffith added: ‘At this stage it is too early to draw conclusions about the cause of the man’s death and it is unhelpful to speculate. We are treating it as an unexplained death until the results of a post-mortem examination are known’.

The incident took place on July 22, at New Brighton, Wirral, and the four teenagers were seen fleeing the scene towards Fort Perch Rock
