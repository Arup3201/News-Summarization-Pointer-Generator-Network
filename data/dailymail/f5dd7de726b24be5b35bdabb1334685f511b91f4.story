Team news

Bournemouth 

Bournemouth will be without Harry Arter and Steve Cook due to suspension after they picked up their fifth bookings of the season against Birmingham in the 8-0 win at the weekend.

However, Eddie Howe is boosted by the return of striker Yann Kermorgant after he served a three-match ban.

Marc Pugh celebrates the second of his three goals against Birmingham  in Bournemouth's 8-0 win

West Brom  

Strikers Victor Anichebe and Brown Ideye could start for West Brom at Bournemouth with head coach Alan Irvine likely to make several changes.

Anichebe scored after coming off the substitutes' bench to help the Baggies to a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace on Saturday while £10million summer buy Ideye is fit again after an ankle problem. Boaz Myhill could start in goal while Gareth McAuley, Cristian Gamboa and Youssouf Mulumbu may be recalled.

Winger Silvestre Varela is unlikely to be risked as he recovers from groin surgery, Jonas Olsson is struggling with an Achilles problem while Claudio Yacob is in his native Argentina due to family illness.

Provisional squad: Foster, Myhill, Pocognoli, Gamboa, Dawson, Lescott, McAuley, Davidson, Wisdom, Baird, Morrison, O'Neil, Mulumbu, Brunt, Blanco, Sessegnon, Samaras, Ideye, Berahino.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) 

Dan Gosling has scored four goals in three League Cup games this season.

Chris Brunt has assisted three goals in his last three appearances in this competition.

West Brom have won four of their last five against Bournemouth in all competitions (L1); a run that includes both previous League Cup meetings between the sides.

This is only the third time that Bournemouth have reached this stage of the League Cup; they lost both previous Round 4 games (0-1 v York in 1961/62, 1-2 v Stoke in 1963/64).

The Cherries have not won in 12 League Cup games against top-flight sides (D3 L9), though they did eliminate then-Premier League Blackburn Rovers on penalties in September 2004.

West Brom have scored exactly four goals in three of their last five League Cup away games.
