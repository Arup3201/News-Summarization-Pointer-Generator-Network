A professional horse trainer has been shot dead in front of his partner in the Long Island home they shared in what police believe was a targeted attack.

Ross Reisner, a popular riding school instructor in the Hamptons, was killed by a bullet fired through the window of his house on Tuesday evening.

The 50-year-old's family described it as a 'planned, professional murder' and police believe the gunman was deliberately targeting the couple.

They had just finished dinner at about 8.45pm when several bullets were fired, killing Mr Reisner and grazing the arm of Kevin Murray, whom he had been in a relationship with for 26 years.

Neighbors in quiet, wealthy Setauket, on Long Island's Gold Coast, recalled hearing gunfire and screams for help.

'I did hear a male voice screaming, "Oh God, help him. Please help me. Help him," neighbor Michelle O’Toole told CBS New York.

The victim's family said a high-powered weapon was used in the attack and Suffolk County police commander John Fitzpatrick said: 'It's clear that person was firing at them.'

He added that the gunman had stood in the couple's yard and waited for the men to appear in the window before shooting. The suspect is then believed to have fled on foot.

Mr Reisner's brother told the Daily News a 45-year-old long-time friend from Manhattan was allegedly being sought over the murder.

'He was an old friend and now this 
craziness. There was something weird 
going on, some bad blood,' Ian Reisner claimed.

His brother was a well-known equestrian in the North East, who had been competing since he was a teenager.

He had recently opened a horse farm in Mattituck with childhood friend Bobby Ginsberg, and the two had been enjoying a successful start to their venture.

'When it came to his training and his riding, he was very serious and dedicated to it - he loved to win,' Mr Ginsberg said. 'On his downtime, he was just one of the funniest people you'd ever hope to meet.'

He told Three Village Patch he was shocked that his friend and business partner had been murdered, and added: 'Everybody knew Ross. He always had clients at the horse shows. He was always striving to be a great trainer and rider.'

The victim's brother said: 'He taught members of high profile families how to ride. He was at the top of his profession.'

Mr Reisner was shot dead in the $600,000 home the couple had been remodeling.

'They had just built their dream house five-and-a-half years ago,' Ms O’Toole, who says she heard at least six gun shots, said.

Mr Reisner was due to take a riding team to the U.S. Equestrian Federation finals in New Jersey next month.

As news of his death reached equestrian circles, many posted tributes to their trainer and fellow horseman on Facebook.

Grace Duy described him as 'not just an amazing trainer but an extraordinary friend.'

Many others, including Alexandra Maracic, posted photos of Mr Reisner walking show jumping courses with them and offering advice at competitions.

Shanette Barth Cohen, who runs the Hampton Classic horse show, said: 'He was very well-liked and it’s a real shock and sad for the whole Long Island equestrian community.'
