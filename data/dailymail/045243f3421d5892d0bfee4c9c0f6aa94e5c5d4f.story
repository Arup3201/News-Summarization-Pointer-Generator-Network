France's foreign minister today said Tony Blair should keep his advice about combating the Islamic terrorists of IS to himself.

Laurent Fabius made it clear that his country did not appreciate the former British Prime Minister suggesting that ground troops should be used against them.

'And where Iraq is concerned, I'm not sure that Mr Blair is the best placed to give out advice,' Mr Fabius told BFMTV from New York, where he is taking part in the UN General Assembly.

Anger: France's foreign minister today said Tony Blair should keep his advice about combating the Islamic terrorists of IS to himself

Mr Blair, who sent troops to invade Iraq along with the Americans in 2003, wrote in an essay for his Faith Foundation that Western powers should consider the use of ground forces 'in the future if it is absolutely necessary'.

The 2003 Anglo-American invasion of Iraq toppled the regime of the dictator Saddam Hussein but led to hundreds of thousands of deaths.

It also led to chaos within the liberated country, allowing jihadist groups such as IS - Islamic State - to flourish.

France started an aerial bombardment of IS forces in Iraq last Friday, with Mr Fabius saying the operation would be 'a long term affair'.

He said: 'If France, like many other countries, has taken a firm stance, it's because we are defending ourselves.' 

His comments came as America and five Arabic countries launched dozens of air strikes against Isis, killing at least 20 militants and blasting a series of its bases.

The attacks - described as 'shock without awe' - began early this morning local time, with Tomahawk missiles, B1 bombers, F16, F18 and F22 strike fighters and drones involved. A total of 50

American air power was backed by warplanes from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, all of whom are determined to destroy ISIS, which they see as a threat to their own governments.

Strong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. The U.S. has also been increasing its surveillance flights over Syria, getting better intelligent on potential targets and militant movements

 Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Arab participation was essential for Obama as he looked to expand the American campaign of air strikes to Syria from Iraq, where the U.S. military has already carried out 190 strikes as of Monday.

Several Arab countries have offered to join the United States in air strikes against Islamic State targets, a senior U.S. official told reporters on Sept. 14.

But the United States has so far refused to detail which nations have given private assurances to Washington that they would join in air strikes in Syria, part of a broader strategy against the Islamic State that includes training and arming moderate Syrian opposition fighters.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said in television interviews over the weekend that other nations were willing to join air strikes in Syria. 

Vital allies: All the U.S. partners in the airstrikes against Syria are Middle Eastern nations. They are Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and Bahrain.

'I will make you a prediction,' Power said on ABC. 'We will not do the air strikes alone if the president decides to do the air strikes.'

Several Arab states have powerful air forces, including Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, for example, has also already agreed to host U.S. training of Syrian opposition fighters.

But many Gulf Arab states have been reluctant to be seen aggressively joining the U.S. campaign in Iraq and Syria, fearing in some cases reprisals by extremists or forces loyal to the Syrian government.

The White House last week declined to 'telegraph' when strikes might occur or what preconditions stood in the way.

Obama will give a speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday to make the case again for world action against Islamic State.

News of the airstrikes comes as ISIS' highly-organized press office released a second propaganda video appearing to feature captured British hostage John Cantlie.

The journalist - wearing a Guantanamo Bay-style orange jumpsuit - is filmed questioning America's preparation for attacks on ISIS, and compares the 'unwinnable' conflict to the Vietnam War.

'The president once called George Bush's Iraq conflict a "dumb war", and couldn't wait to distance America from it when he came into power. Now he's being inextricably drawn back in,' Cantlie says. 

The air strikes were launched from land bases in the Middle East, while the F18s were launched from the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush, which is in the Persian Gulf.

Tomahawks were fired from the USS Arleigh Burke, a guided missile destroyer in the Red Sea.

Hit: The American airstrikes also struck other militant groups in Syria - among them Al-Nusra Front (pictured)

The first wave of strikes lasted for 90 minutes and one video on social media showed blasts across Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic state.

Among the targets which reports from social media claimed had been hit were the city's governor's house, national hospital and the Equestrian Club.

One account said 20 of the militant group's fighters had been killed in the strikes.

Other targets were hit in Deir al-Zor province in the north of Syria, where ISIS have gained territory.

And areas held by the al-Qaeda group called Al-Nusra Front in Aleppo and Idlib were also struck, sources said.

Just the beginning? Along with partner nations Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, the strikes began in the ISIS stronghold city of Raqqa
