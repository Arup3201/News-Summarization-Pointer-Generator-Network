Cadbury is to stop selling chocolate bars aimed at individuals containing more than 250 calories as part of a government anti-obesity initiative.

The former British favourite, controversially bought by American-owned confectionary firm Mondelez International in 2010, will phase out its most calorific bars as part of a drive by the Department of Health to crack down on obesity.

The Dairy Milk bar and a half, Dairy Milk Whole Nut bar and a half, and Dairy Milk Fruit and Nut bar and a half, are among the products affected. These are all aimed at individuals.

Family-sized bars are not affected by the change because they are meant for sharing, thus do not fall under the initiative.

Earlier this year, hundreds of foods and drinks companies were asked to outline moves they will make to help people make healthier choices as part of the Department of Health’s voluntary Responsibility Deal. 

Mondelez said at least two other food brands it owns could be altered in size, indicating that a corresponding price decrease for those items could be on the cards.

It did not say which but the company also produces popular products like Philadelphia cheese spread and Belvita breakfast biscuits.

In a statement the firm said: ‘Mondelez International knows it has a part to play in helping people lead healthier lives.

‘One way do to this is to help consumers reduce their calorie intake, which is why we signed the calorie reduction pledge.

‘As
 part of this pledge, we have committed that, by the end of 2015, all 
our single serve (bars) confectionery products will be 250 calories or 
less.’

The Department of Health’s anti-obesity deal with food firms has been criticised because it is voluntary.

As a result, Coca-Cola, Kellogg, Danone have so far ignored requests to lower the number of calories in their products.

Ministers aim to cut the calories consumed in England by five billion per day. Sainsbury, Kraft Foods, Nestlé, Tate & Lyle and Unilever, have also failed to join the joint pledge on calorie reduction.

Public Health Minister Jane Ellison 
welcomed the food companies which did co-operate with its health 
initiative, but said more efforts were needed.

'Whilst it is very encouraging to see so many companies getting behind the Responsibility Deal, we know there remains more to be done'

She said: ‘Whilst it is very encouraging to see so many companies getting behind the Responsibility Deal, we know there remains more to be done.

‘We cannot credibly tackle the major public health challenges our country faces without engaging with the companies that play such a big part in people’s lives and it is vital that momentum is maintained.’

In the UK, 67 per cent of men and 57 per cent of women are either overweight or obese, according to the Global Burden of Disease study.

More than one in four children are overweight or obese, and more girls are overweight than boys.

In 2012 the Cadbury’s single Dairy Mail shrunk by eight per cent in size from 49g to 45g. Despite the reduction in size, the price of the bars has increased by a penny to 60p.

In 2011 Cadbury reduced the size of the 140g bar of Dairy Milk to 120g, losing the equivalent of two chunks.
