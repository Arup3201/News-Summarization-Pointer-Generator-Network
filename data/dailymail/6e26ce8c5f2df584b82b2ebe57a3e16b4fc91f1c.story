The devastated 19-year-old sibling of murdered mother of four Tia Maria Landers has paid tribute to her caring big sister who bought her up when their father got sick with cancer.

And the teenager has described how she will ‘step up’ and look after Tia’s four children now their mother has been so cruelly killed, just like Tia used to look after her.

Jamie Landers, who was away at university in Queensland, when she found out that her 28-year-old sister had been brutally murdered, described Tia as a ‘bubbly’ and ‘adoring’ mother who was ‘always helping other people’.

Police say Tia suffered a violent death, but have not revealed exactly what killed her. She had been missing for a month when her body was found in a shallow grave in a state forest at Beerburrum, north of Brisbane, on Thursday.

‘I am devastated… I helped her raise her kids, she was the best mum, they adored her, she was always spoiling them and making them princess dresses,’ Jamie told MailOnline.

Jamie, who is studying for a law degree and hopes to join the police academy, said she always looked up to the big sister who brought her up throughout high-school.

‘We used to pretend we were the Spice Girls, I pretended I was Baby Spice and she was Scary Spice because of her curly hair.

'She used to have friends to stay and we would play mums and dads. She was always caring about everyone else, she always bringing people home and taking care of them,’ she explained.

Tia would not only look after her own four young children but also ensured Jamie was ready for school.

‘She made my lunches and made sure I got dressed for school. She helped me grow up and she let me be there for her children, she taught me how to do so many things it’s hard to list them all.

‘She’s going to be missed. I lived with her when my dad first got ill with cancer.’

Tragic: The mother of four had been missing for a month before her body was found by police in bushland in a state forest at Beerburrum, north of Brisbane

Jamie described her sister as a popular and outgoing young women and said when she was murdered it wasn’t just Tia’s life that was taken but ‘a piece of all her family’.

‘She has so many friends, everyone knows her for being bubbly, out there, and having fun and living in a dream world.

‘So many people are missing her at the moment,’ she said. 

Jamie also wants to set the record straight after Tia was described as a ‘gangster’s girlfriend’ in the press.

Of criminal Wade Bartz, who Tia was romantically linked to, Jamie said: ‘They are not in a relationship.’

She explained that Wade is definitely not the father of any of Tia’s four children and that the pair only met ‘two years ago’.

‘She didn’t even know him when her last daughter was born,’ Jamie explained.

After her body was found, Ms Landers' sister wrote on Facebook: 'Rest in peace my beautiful sister'

The student explained how Tia’s two boys and two girls, aged 4, 5, 8 and 10, are ‘not doing well’ since their mother went missing on June 16.

Jamie now feels it is her responsibility to ‘take them on and look after them’.

‘I’m the youngest sibling and the only one without children, so I will step up,’ she said.

‘I study and work, but I won’t be looking after them just now because my parents are still able to. But my father is very ill with cancer so when they are unable to I will step up and take over.’

Talking about putting her own dreams aside, Jamie added: ‘You've got to do what you’ve got to do.’

Jamie hadn’t seen her sister recently before her death, as she was away at university, but she received a message on her phone asking her to call her a few days before she disappeared.

‘I didn't get to speak to her and then I saw her missing person report in the papers and online. At first I thought “this is a joke, this is a bad prank, she is probably just at a friend’s place”.

Confused: 'I just don't understand it's like a sad movie. Things like this don't happen in real life,' Jamie said of her sister Tia (pictured)

‘I never imagined this would happen. I just don’t understand it’s like a sad movie. Things like this don’t happen in real life,’ she said.

Jamie became really worried about her sister when her mother phoned her in tears and said the police were conducting searches in the bush.

‘She knows what my sister is like so to hear her in tears that’s when I thought “oh no don’t let this be”.’

Brisbane couple John Edward Harris, 42, and Linda Eileen Appleton, 40, who police say were known to Ms Landers, have been charged with torturing and murdering her and will spend at least the next six months behind bars after they were remanded in custody during a court mention on Friday.

Jamie is desperate for answers after police alleged the couple tortured her sister at their home north of Brisbane before killing her.

‘I don’t know how this happened and how it led up to this. She would help other people before she'd help herself.

Popular: 'She has so many friends, everyone knows her for being bubbly, out there, and having fun and living in a dream world,' Jamie said of her big sister Tia

‘She'd ask for money just to give to friends she was always helping other people,’ Jamie said.

Speaking out on behalf of the Landers family, who have flown in from all parts of Queensland to be together, Jamie also addressed rumours in the press that her sister was schizophrenic.

‘She had health issues but it wasn’t to do with that,’ she said.

She explained: ‘Everyone makes mistakes. I think she should be judged by who she actually was.’

Jamie is now busy making funeral arrangements for Tia with her mother.

‘I’m helping my mum organise the funeral because we feel we know Tia best.

‘There will be nothing fake that she's not. She was bubbly, out there, she’d always do crazy make-up, all colourful. We don't want it to be a sad day, there will be no black,’ she said.

Keen to explain the type of person her sister really was, Jamie added: ‘She is a human being she's not a gangster’s girlfriend. She is a mother of four, a sister, a friend, a daughter… she deserves to be treated nicely.'
