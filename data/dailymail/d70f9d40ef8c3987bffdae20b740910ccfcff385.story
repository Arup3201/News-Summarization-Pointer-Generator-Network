Controversy: LA Lakers star Kobe Bryant has said that he wouldn't necessarily support someone because of the color of their skin and criticized Lebron James and Miami Heat

LA Lakers star Kobe Bryant has been heavily criticized after saying that he didn't think he should necessarily have an opinion on Trayvon Martin's shooting just because he is African American.

During an interview for a profile piece in the New Yorker, which will be published on April 4, the 35-year-old said also took the opportunity to pour scorn on Lebron James and the Miami Heat for posting a photo of them wearing hoodies in the aftermath of Martin's death at the hands of George Zimmerman.

Asked about that, Bryant said he took exception to any idea that Africa-Americans should hold opinions based on their race alone.

'I won’t react to something just because I’m supposed to, because I’m an African-American,' Bryant said.

'That argument doesn't make no sense to me. So we want to advance as a society and a culture, but, say, if something happens to an African-American we immediately come to his defense?

'Yet you want to talk about how far we’ve progressed as a society? Well, we’ve progressed as a society, then don’t jump to somebody’s defense just because they’re African-American.

'You sit and you listen to the facts just like you would in any other situation, right? So I won’t assert myself.'

The comments have provoked a huge backlash and debate and led to accusations that Bryant is out of touch with real African-American issues.

Indeed, Bryant, who spent much of his childhood in Italy, where his father was a professional basketball player, has even faced calls for young people to boycott any product he endorses.

Civil rights activist Najee Ali, director of Project Islamic H.O.P.E., called for a boycott of all things Bryant.

'African American youth should no longer buy Bryant’s jerseys or shoes and should boycott all products he endorses,' Ali said in a statement according to Fox News.

'Bryant doesn’t identify with the struggle that our African-American youth face nationally. So why should we continue to support Bryant who has never truly identified with the African American experience.'

Division: Trayvon Martin was killed on Februaru 26, 2012, as he passed through the gated, Sanford, Fla., community where George Zimmerman lived and served as a watch volunteer

Speaking on Friday,  Miami Heat's Wayne Wade responded to the the piece, called 'The Last Quarter'.

He denied that race was the overriding factor in posing for the hoodie picture and said that proximity was the biggest factor.

Martin was killed on Februray 26, 2012, as he passed through the gated, Sanford, Florida, community where Zimmerman lived and served as a watch volunteer.

'It was our backyard, and being in our backyard, being something that a lot of guys on this team—not only growing up in the kind of environment that Trayvon was in—but also having young boys,' Wade told Bleacher Report.

'Knowing that he is a big fan of the Miami Heat. That is something that we got behind. As a team. I can't even say the organization.

'It was as a team. We got behind it. And it was more so that than the color of his skin.'

Support: Some did not take umbrage with Kobe Bryant's comments and offered qualified support for them

Response: In the aftermath of his comments to the New Yorker magazine being reported, Kobe Bryant clarified his position on the matter in this Tweet

However, hours later, Bryant tweeted support for Martin, saying 'Travon (sic) Martin was wronged THATS my opinion and thats what I believe the FACTS showed. The system did not work #myopinion #tweetURthoughts.'

But Twitter was split on coming to the defense of the 16-time NBA All-Star and challenging his support of issues in the African American community.

Hall of Fame NFL running back Jim Brown told the New Yorker that Bryant doesn’t understand African-American culture.

'Kobe is somewhat confused about culture, because he was brought up in another country,' said Brown.

A piece at The Urban Daily declared, 'Over the span of Kobe Bryant‘s career….we’ve seen him do and say some very smug, cavalier and even cornball things at times but the comments that he made regarding the Miami Heat’s support after Trayvon Martin was killed…by far takes the cake!'
