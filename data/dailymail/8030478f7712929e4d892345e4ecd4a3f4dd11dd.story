NYPD detectives say they have identified the biker who brutally beat a tech executive after a harrowing chase through the streets of New York last weekend.

The New York Post reports that police believe Reginald Chance, 38, of Brooklyn, is the prime suspect in the attack, part of which was captured on a fellow rider's helmet cam. Chance has retained a lawyer and is expected to turn himself into cops on Friday.

Alexian Lien was dragged from his Range Rover and beaten so badly he had to be hospitalized after he enraged dozens of members of a biker club after a confrontation on a New York City highway.

ID'd: Reginald Chance, 38, is believed to be the man that NYPD detectives have been seeking in the beating case, which has captured national attention

Fearful: Alexian Lien and his wife Roslyn Ng have revealed how they were just trying to protect their family when their car plowed down a group of bikers that had cornered them in New York City

Chance is described as working at a sandwich shop, where is his both a driver and a manager. The Post reports that he is from Guyana.

Lien was driving his wife, Rosyln Ng,
and their two-year-old daughter as the couple celebrated their first 
wedding anniversary, when one biker braked in front of them, causing 
Lien to hit him and sparking the chase through the streets of New York.

At
one point, the 20 to 30 bikers cornered their car, causing a panicked 
Lien to plow through the crowd, seriously injuring one rider. He sped 
off but when he came to a standstill in Manhattan traffic, bikers 
smashed his window, pulled him from the car and beat him.

'Our plan last Sunday was to 
celebrate our wedding anniversary by having a nice family day out with 
our two-year-old daughter,' Lien's family wrote in a statement released 
through their lawyers.

'Unfortunately, instead, we were placed in grave danger by a mob of reckless and violent motorcyclists.'

The
family extended their sympathies to the severely injured biker, Edwin 
Mieses, Jr., who will never walk again. But they insisted that Lien had 
no choice but to drive through the intimidating group.

'We
were faced with a life-threatening situation, and my husband was forced
under the circumstances to take the actions that he did in order to 
protect the lives of our entire family,' a statement said.

Organizer: Jamie Lao puts together rallies of hundreds of bikers - all from his parents' basement

Terrified: They say they were justified in their fears because Lien was later pulled from the car when it stopped in traffic and beaten, pictured. They said they had just been trying to protect their daughter, 2

Force: This shows the moment he decided to drive through the crowd to escape, seriously injuring a biker

Injuries: The biker, Edwin Mieses, Jr., suffered a broken spine and will not be able to walk again, his family said

'Our fear for our lives 
was confirmed when the incident ended with the ruthless and brutal 
attack on my husband, me, and, most importantly, our two-year-old child.

'We
know in our hearts that we could not have done anything differently, 
and we believe that anyone faced with this sort of grave danger would 
have taken the same course of action in order to protect their family.'

They
also thanked witnesses who ran to their aid and stopped the bikers from
hurting Lien any further, and they thanked people from across the 
country for their support.

As police work to identify the perpetrators of the attack, The Post published the name of one of the organizers of the rally that brought hundreds of bikers together.

Jamie Lao, 29, operates two websites that rally the New York City motorcyclists - and he does it all from his mother's basement in Queens.

Neighbors say his rallies are a nuisance - and are frightening.

'There was about 300-400 bikes,' one neighbor said.

'Itâ€™s disturbing to see 300 bikes, the neighbors were terrified. All the smoke went into the houses. Everybody was traumatized.'

Arrest: One of the bikers, Christopher Cruz (right, pictured with his lawyer H. Benjamin Perez in New York on Wednesday) has been charged after allegedly sparking the incident with reckless driving

One biker, 28-year-old Christopher Cruz, has already been charged in the incident; he appeared in court on Wednesday to face charges of reckless driving and unlawful imprisonment.

Prosecutors say he is the biker who slowed down in front of the SUV, sparking the chain of events.

Cruz
is the only person charged criminally so far in the encounter that was 
caught on a helmet-mounted camera worn by another biker and was posted 
online anonymously.

The 
Manhattan district attorney's office decided not immediately to 
prosecute a second person arrested, Allen Edwards, 42, who surrendered 
to police on Tuesday.

Vigil: On Wednesday night, friends and family gathered outside the hospital for a candle-lit vigil for Mieses

Emotional: His wife Dayana sobbed at the vigil. She said her husband was just trying to help another biker

As the police push forward with their investigation, Edward Mieses, Jr. remains in hospital after being hit by Lien as he drove away.

He suffered broken legs and spine injuries that have left him paralyzed, his family said.

His wife, Dayana Mieses, has insisted he was simply trying to help another rider when he was hit.

On Wednesday night, she held a candle-lit silent vigil outside the hospital where he is being kept.
