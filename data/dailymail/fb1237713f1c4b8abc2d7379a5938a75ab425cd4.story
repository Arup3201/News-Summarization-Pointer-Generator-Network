In the second of a new weekly column, Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel gives his verdict on the footballing issues of the week, saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver...

WHAT'S HOT

Black boots

Puma killed it. On May 14, 2014, the sportswear manufacturer unveiled their ‘Tricks’ boots. 'The right boot is pink, the left boot is blue,' they announced, breathlessly, confirming that Cesc Fabregas, Radamel Falcao, Mario Balotelli and Yaya Toure would be among those wearing them at the World Cup. So that went well. Actually, that’s not fair. They did have one of the leading members of the German squad signed up, too. Marco Reus. So that went really well.

On that day, coloured boots jumped the shark. The greatest footballers in the world are meant to look like athletes, not one candelabra short of Liberace. At which point, no doubt, the greatest of them all knew exactly how to be special again.

'Black,' said Cristiano Ronaldo. 'Next season, it’s back to black.' And so, at last weekend’s Clasico, he revealed his new look. Being Cristiano, there were of course, individual touches – a large CR7 embossed in white on the side – but Ronaldo has reverted to old school black footwear and so far it has been a winner. Ronaldo’s Real Madrid outplayed Barcelona and the next day Robin van Persie scored an injury time equaliser for Manchester United against Chelsea – also in retro black.

Indeed, considering how intimidating Mike Tyson used to look in black boots and plain black shorts – what the hell was the rest of football thinking prancing around in pink? These lads liked a bit of black, too.

 

Marouane Fellaini

Poor old David Moyes. Even his guy, the first major signing of his brief Manchester United reign, is now playing better under the new guy. In the last two matches, Louis van Gaal has brought more out of United’s £27million midfielder than Moyes did at any stage last year. Man of the match against Chelsea, Fellaini is shaping up as a dominant force in the heart of the play, just in time for the derby meeting with Manchester City on Sunday.

Fellaini looked short of confidence under Moyes, shrinking in his red shirt when he should have been an imposing presence. Van Gaal is believed to have told Ed Woodward, the chief executive, that he did not see Fellaini as a United player and was ready to let him go to Napoli on loan. Then circumstances intervened. Injury thwarted Fellaini’s departure – and now he has taken his chance.

A late equaliser against West Bromwich Albion restored his self-belief. Charged with keeping Chelsea’s Cesc Fabregas quiet last week he did just that, and then won the header to set up United’s equalising goal. His figures were superb: he ran 12.17km, one kilometre farther than any other player on the pitch, including 70 sprints – more than either of United’s overlapping full-backs. Nine games in, Van Gaal he is convinced that English football requires greater physical qualities – and Fellaini fits that bill. After Fabregas, he will be picking on someone his own size this weekend in Yaya Toure.

Madison Bumgarner 

Crazy name, crazy guy. Well, not really. The crazy guys in Major League Baseball are the ones who can hit the ball out of the park. Bumgarner isn’t like that. He’s the one who stops the fun, a pitcher who ties the hitters in knots. And he’s the main reason the San Francisco Giants are World Series champions again. 'The difference,' said Sports Illustrated. Simple as that.

Bumgarner was named Most Valuable Player after the Giants beat the Kansas City Royals 4-3 in a best of seven series. He came out of the bullpen to close out the last five innings for no score as the Giants won the deciding game 3-2. So why didn’t he start? Two days earlier, Bumgarner had thrown a 117-pitch shut out. No runs, and only four hits. He was being rested.

That’s the difference between baseball and cricket. One guy can pitch every ball. And Bumgarner threw in 21 of San Francisco’s 61 innings. In the days when pitchers’ arms are protected like Qing dynasty porcelain, that is a stunning record. Of his 291 pitches, 205 were strikes. Baseball had become an increasingly discredited sport dominated by steroid-packed big hitters. Bumgarner has restored it to the old days: the pitcher as king. 'He’s a stud,' said Tim Hudson, without a trace of envy. Who’s Hudson? The pitcher he replaced.

WHAT’S NOT

Lee Clark's agent

Good God, who is advising this guy? Has he got a death wish? Actually, I take that back. Maybe Clark is the headstrong type. Maybe he won’t listen to reason. Either way, he can certainly pick them. Clark would appear to have talent. He took Huddersfield Town on a record-breaking 43-game unbeaten run, only to be sacked three months after it ended having lost two games. He then spent two fulfilling years at potless Birmingham City, where he prevented them losing 8-0 at home to Bournemouth, which they promptly did the moment they sacked him.

Now Clark has returned – at Blackpool. No, seriously he has. He’s jumped from the second worst team in the Championship, to the absolute worst. That’s right. Worse than the team that lost 8-0 at home to Bournemouth. Worse by five whole points. Blackpool are the team with the poorest point aggregate – six from 14 matches – in the top seven divisions of English football. At least there was an excuse for the mess at Birmingham: their owner went to prison. Blackpool’s Karl Oyston is very much at large. It comes to something when your football club might be better run from Parkhurst.

It is only a pity that George Reynolds of Darlington is no longer around. Convictions for smuggling, safe-cracking, handling explosives, burglary, theft and tax evasion, and a club that ended up reforming as Darlington 1883 in Division One of the Northern League, after he had left them ruined. No doubt Clark would love to work with an owner like George.

The London Olympics

Very hot, the London Olympics. Very hot in 2012. In 2014, not so much. Nevertheless, the usual moans have accompanied news that builders Balfour Beatty will need an additional figure of around £50m from the public purse to convert the roof of the Olympic Stadium to the satisfaction of West Ham United. There is annoyance that, under the terms of the deal, the club does not bear the cost.

The critics are outraged, insisting West Ham have the deal of the century, a brand new home given to them by the people of Britain. So let’s walk it through one more time. To begin with, this could all have been avoided if the gang of three overseeing the project – Lord Coe, Tessa Jowell and Ken Livingstone – had accepted a football tenant was the only profitable legacy, and had insisted on a design that could be seamlessly converted. They didn’t. So this is the story.

There was an Olympics. We had to build a stadium. The Olympics are now over. There will not be another here any time soon. Nor will there be sufficient athletics events or pop concerts to support the venue. So either the Olympic Stadium finds a regular tenant, or it sits empty, running up enormous maintenance costs, like the Millennium Dome, until it crumbles into the Thames. Your call. This way, we pick up one last tab and then it starts working for us. The other way, you pay. For ever. Thank the gang of three for this Hobson’s choice.

Manchester City

We all know what constitutes a crisis for an elite club these days: three games without winning. What was a drama after the surrender of a 2-0 lead against CSKA Moscow, became a blip with the loss to West Ham and a full-blown crisis after defeat at home to Newcastle United. Lose to Manchester United and it is possible City will reach headline stage four: meltdown.

That first result saw them staring at an early European exit, the second left them trailing Chelsea by four points – and it could have been worse – then Newcastle’s reserves dumped them from the Capital One Cup. The pressure is on Manuel Pellegrini, with speculation already surrounding his future if City fail to win a trophy of significance.

Meanwhile, in retirement, Sir Alex Ferguson looks like a genius. He regularly kept his serial winners at United hungry with nothing more than a reign of terror. Pellegrini appears lumbered with dilettantes. They thought they had the Moscow game won, only woke up to West Ham’s threat when the second went in, and took Newcastle for mugs. There is only one set of mugs after that sequence of results. They need to win the next one, and not just to keep Jose’s big, front-running horses in sight.
