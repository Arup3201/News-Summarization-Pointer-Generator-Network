Everton and England defender Phil Jagielka talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes and career highlight to who would play him in a movie about his life. 

WHO IS YOUR SPORTING HERO? 

My brother, Stephen. You always want to do what your big brother does. He started out with Manchester City and had spells at Shrewsbury and Accrington. Stephen  encouraged me to chase my dream and became my idol.

WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN IF YOU WERE NOT A SPORTSMAN?

I think I’d have always been in sports. If I hadn’t been a footballer, I’d have wanted to be a golfer. In reality, I’d probably be a PE teacher. I couldn’t work in an office. That would send me stir crazy.

WHAT WAS THE BEST MOMENT OF YOUR CAREER?

I’ve got a few; my Everton debut, my first cap and goal for England, but I have to choose my debut for Sheffield United against Swindon (May 2000). I came on as a substitute in a 2-2 draw and knew then I had a chance of making it.

AND THE WORST... 

Rupturing my cruciate ligament against Manchester City in April 2009 and I missed the FA Cup final against Chelsea because of it. Sitting in a suit at Wembley in sweltering heat with my knee in a brace was torture.

Rupturing his knee ligaments and missing the 2009 FA Cup final is Jagielka's worst career moment

IF YOUR HOUSE WAS BURNING DOWN, WHAT WOULD BE THE ONE POSSESSION YOU WOULD SAVE? 

As long as my wife, Emily, and kids, Mia and Zach, were safe, all I’d be bothered about is my dog, Leo. He’s a fearsome shih tzu, disguised as a little ball of fluff.

THREE FAVOURITE SONGS ON YOUR IPOD?

I’m not a big music fan. I’ll have Radio 1 on when I’m on the way into work but I tend to use my time in the car to give my Dad or my mates a safe, hands-free call.

WHAT WAS THE BEST BOOK YOU'VE READ?

I’m not a big reader, either, but I’ve just completed my team-mate Leon Osman’s autobiography. It was especially good.

Leon Osman's (right) autobiography was the last book that Jagielka can remember reading

WHAT'S YOUR BEST KARAOKE SONG?

I wanted to do Eye of The Tiger as my initiation song when I joined Everton but got stitched up. I told Phil Neville about it but he told Ossie, who got up and sang it before me. I ended up doing an impromptu version of Blue Suede Shoes. I think I pulled it off. Just.

CAN YOU COOK?

Yep, I’m not bad. Lasagne, spaghetti bolognese. If I can chuck it in a pan and stir it around, I’m fine. You won’t catch me going for any fancy ingredients or adding garlic to everything, mind.

IN A FILM OF YOUR LIFE, WHO WOULD PLAY YOU? 

If we are going Hollywood — and why not? — I’d say someone like Will Ferrell, Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler.

TELL US A SECRET... 

I still get called ‘Son of Neil’. It’s well known I had a great relationship with Neil Warnock but he used to come into training and ask in front of the lads whether his wife, Sharon, had cooked my scrambled eggs properly that morning. 

I went along with it for the banter but that’s where the nickname came from. I can categorically say, however, Mrs Warnock never made my breakfast!
