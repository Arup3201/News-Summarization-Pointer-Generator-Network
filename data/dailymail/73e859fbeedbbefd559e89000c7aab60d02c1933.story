Claim: Abdel Hakim Belhadj, who led the rebel assault on Tripoli, could be in line for a £1million payout

A Libyan rebel leader handed over by 
MI6 for torture by Colonel Gaddafi’s henchmen yesterday launched legal 
action against Britain.

Abdel Hakim Belhadj – who this year 
helped Nato oust the tyrant by leading the military assault on Tripoli –
could win £1million compensation from UK taxpayers.

He claims Britain helped snatch him 
on behalf of Gaddafi’s regime in 2004, a few days before Tony Blair 
embraced Gaddafi in the notorious ‘Deal in the Desert’.

He says he suffered six years of 
abuse in the despot’s brutal prisons, and during this time was 
interrogated by British spies including a female MI6 agent.

Mr Belhadj, who was released from 
custody in 2010, is now a key figure in the new Libya and many expect 
him to run for president.

His wife, Fatima Boucher, who was 
pregnant when she was seized with him, is also suing the UK.

She was 
held for four months so could be in line for hundreds of thousands in 
compensation.

Lawyers acting for the couple served 
legal papers on the Treasury Solicitor yesterday, and insisted Mr 
Belhadj was only suing the Government because ministers had ignored his 
requests for a full apology over his ‘barbaric’ treatment.

Mr Belhadj, 45, claims he was 
injected with truth drugs and left hanging by his wrists in a Tripoli 
cell as his interrogators beat him and demanded to know the whereabouts 
of Osama Bin Laden.

Whitehall sources have claimed a 
Cabinet minister would almost certainly have had to approve MI6 agents 
turning him over to Gaddafi, although the Foreign Secretary at the time,
Jack Straw, has denied any knowledge of it.

Letter apparently implicating the Government: The note congratulates Libya on the arrival of Abu 'Abd Allah Sadiq - the other name Abdel Hakim Belhadj went by. The authenticity has not been confirmed

Mr Belhadj fled Libya as a dissident 
in the 1990s. He ended up Malaysia where he sought asylum through the 
British High Commission.

But MI6 agents tipped off the CIA, 
and Mr Belhadj and his wife were taken into custody as they changed 
planes in Bangkok, it is alleged. U.S. officials then flew him to Libya, it is claimed.

Sapna Malik, the couple’s lawyer, 
said: ‘The barbaric treatment which our clients describe, both at the 
hands of the Americans and the Libyans, is beyond comprehension and yet 
it appears that the UK was responsible for setting off this torturous 
chain of events.’

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘The
Government stands firmly against torture and cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment or punishment. We do not condone it, nor do we ask 
others to do it on our behalf.’

Close alliance: Tony Blair meets Colonel Gaddafi at his desert base in Tripoli. The court case is likely to be embarrassing for the British Government
