A startling video has revealed truckers texting and calling on their phones while driving on New York City's busy highways - risking the lives of their fellow motorists.

The footage was revealed by WABC as the families of victims who lost their lives to distracted truck drivers called for stricter penalties for using devices behind the wheel.

The video shows one driver on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway texting on his phone, while another driver on the Long Island Expressway looks down to dial on his phone before chatting away.

Danger: In a video taken by WABC, a driver in the New York City area apparently texts on his phone

Unaware: Another driver chats with his passenger as he apparently checks his phone behind the wheel

And in one particularly shocking clip, one bearded driver can be seen using one hand to speak on his phone, before switching hands to continue a conversation on a second phone.

If stopped for talking on their cell phones, the drivers would face penalties such as a $150 fine - or up to $400 if it was a repeat offense - and five points on their licenses.

But officials and families of victims say that is clearly not deterring the drivers.

The adult children of New York couple George and Kathy Weed, who were killed when a driver slammed his tractor-trailer in the back of their car as he allegedly texted on his cell phone, said the drivers need to think about the potential results of their actions.

Oblivious: This driver could get five points on his driving license if stopped by police, the news channel noted

Their father was slowing to stop when the truck hit their car from behind and forced them into another truck, killing them.

'We're an extremely close-knit family,' daughter Tricia Weed told WABC. 'And this utterly destroyed us. I mean devastating beyond words.'

NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said he was shocked to see the drivers on their phones and that the penalties needed to be addressed.

'[The video] indicates a lot of people driving commercial vehicles are still using personal electronic devices and that would indicate the enforcement side of it is not strong enough,' he said.
