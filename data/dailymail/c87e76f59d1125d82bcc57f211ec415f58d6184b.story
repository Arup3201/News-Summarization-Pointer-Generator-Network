New York's Metro-North Railroad says one of its employees was struck and killed by a train while working on tracks in Manhattan.

The nation's second-busiest railroad says it happened at 12:54 a.m. Monday at Park Avenue and East 106th Street.

The employee was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. His identity wasn't released.

Dead: A Metro-North employee was struck and killed by a train in Manhattan while doing work on the tracks Monday morning, MTA officials confirmed

About 50 passengers were aboard the train, the 12:47 a.m. from Grand Central Terminal bound for Poughkeepsie.

Service was suspended while emergency crews worked, and the 50 passengers on the train that hit the worker were transferred to another train resuming their trip at 2:17 a.m.

The death is being investigated by Metro-North and MTA police.

Service was restored before the morning rush.

Timeline: The Hudson Line train departed Grand Central Terminal at 12:47 a.m. en route to Poughkeepsie. Approximately 50 passengers on the train were safely moved to another train and resumed their trip at 2:17 a.m.

Metro-North serves 281,000 riders a day in New York and Connecticut.

It has experienced a spate of problems in the last year, including a derailment in the Bronx that killed four passengers and injured 71.

Last May, a derailment in Bridgeport, Connecticut, injured 76.

In the same month, track foreman Robert Luden, 52, 
was killed in Connecticut after a student rail controller put the track 
where Luden was working back into service without approval.

Last nights death comes after Metro-North's new president, Joseph Giulietti, vowed to improve safety on the 31-year-old railroad.
