If you think your family is a handful, spare a thought for Sarah Ward. 

Every day, the busy mum from Crayford, Kent, changes up to 30 nappies, eight sets of clothes, makes 12 bottles of milk and washes and irons four loads of washing. 

The 29 year old is looking forward to a well earned rest as she prepares to celebrate Mother's Day for the first time at home with her young brood of four.

The day is especially significant for Sarah as she feared she might never conceive.  

She said: 'The last year has been hard work and being a mum to four one year olds is crazy and yes it is like running a nursery at times but I would not change it for the world.

‘I used to dread Mother’s Day when I was struggling to fall pregnant, now I cannot wait - they are my little miracles.’

Sarah's son Freddie was just eight weeks old when she discovered she was pregnant again.

When the doctors discovered that she was expecting triplets, they advised her to abort one of hte babies to give the other two a better chance of survival.

But Sarah and her partner Benn Smith, 31,decided to keep all three.

She said: ‘I just couldn’t do it. How could I pick one? 

'Thank God I didn’t because look at them now. They are perfect.'

Sarah said that looking after four children under the age of one makes her the 'luckiest mum in the world and possibly the most tired too'

Against the odds, the triplets were born seven weeks prematurely on March 10 last year when big brother Freddie was still only nine months old.

Stanley arrived first weighing 3lb 12oz, followed by Reggie, 4lb 7oz and sister Daisy 3lb 14oz.

The babies were rushed straight to special baby care where the family spent their first Mother’s Day fraught with worry.

They were finally discharged a few weeks later, so this will be their first ever Mother’s Day at home as a family.

Proud Sarah says she still feels like the luckiest mother alive after once fearing she would never be a mother at all.

She had been booked in to see her GP over suspected fertility problems when she conceived Freddie, who was born 1st June 2013. 

She added: ‘Mother’s Day feels so exciting this year because we finally have them all at home. 

'Now I have the family I always dreamed of and more.

‘I am the luckiest mum in the world and possibly the most tired too.’

Postal worker Benn plans to treat Sarah to a meal and chocolates – and she certainly deserves to put her feet up.

Sarah said: ‘It’s exhausting but we wouldn’t change it for the world.’
