These striking images show how our hands are riddled with bacteria and viruses from everyday tasks such as picking up an old dishcloth to cleaning a kitchen surface.

They have been produced as the latest scare tactic to encourage hand washing - therefore reducing the risk of illnesses such as norovirus, E.coli, colds and flu.

Bacteria from faeces are spread around when people don’t wash their 
hands after using the toilet, changing nappies, handling cat litter and 
similar activities.

Dirty: These images show how bacteria and viruses attach themselves to our hands during everyday tasks

We then touch surfaces and then put our hands, and the bugs - including ones 
that are found in human faeces - into our mouths

The photos were created by Peter Hoffman, an expert in infection control at Public Health England.

He touched everyday objects and contaminated foods - or had used the toilet. .

He then pressed his hands onto a substance that only allows germs from faecal matter to grow.

He said: 'People may not be aware of how many
 germs they get on their hands after doing a range of general everyday 
tasks,  so this series of photos really helps to highlight this.'

An old dishcloth, for example, was riddled with with bugs - more than after using the loo. 

However the images also highlight just how easy it is to get rid of the majority of the bugs with simple soap and water. While it doesn't totally sterilise the hands (see images), when done properly, basic hand washing greatly reduces contamination

Mr Hoffman added: 'Just as contamination was passed from my hands to the growth surfaces in
 the pictures, so it could be passed from your hands to your mouth, the 
food you handle or any other route of infection.'

However the images also highlight just how easy it is to get rid of the majority of the bugs with simple soap and water.

While it doesn't totally sterilise the hands (see images), when done properly, basic hand washing greatly reduces contamination.

Experts warn that not handwashing means just one bacterium can grow into hundreds and thousands in a short space of time

Mr Hoffman added: 'Washing the hands using
 soap and water is integral to breaking the cycle of transmission of 
harmful bugs whether that is in a hospital or in our own homes and 
everyone needs to adopt this very good habit.'

The images come as new resarch reveals that just two thirds of Britons admit to washing their hands after using the loo. 

Perhaps
 unsurprisingly, men are the least thorough with their hand washing - 
with less than six in ten always washing their hands thoroughly 
after using the toilet.

Women adopt better hygiene habits with almost 
three quarters claiming thorough hand washing, according 
to market analysts Mintel.

Dr Paul Cosford, Director of Health Protection and Medical Director at Public Health England, said: 'It is quite shocking to see just how many bacteria we get onto our hands from doing everyday tasks.

'If we don’t wash our hands properly then just one bacterium can grow into hundreds and thousands in a relatively short space of time.

'These are then spread around our environment and onto other people and so on. This is why it is so important that we wash our hands thoroughly particularly before preparing food, after handling raw meat and after going to the toilet.'

The new Mintel research found that Londoners pays the least attention to hand washing with 55 per cent failing to follow basic hygiene rules. People in Manchester and Liverpool boast the highest levels of hand hygiene (75 per cent).

It also highlights low levels of hygiene in many of Britain’s kitchens.

Less than 40 per cent of Britons disinfect food preparation surfaces after contact with raw food and even fewer (22 per cent) disinfect food preparation areas before using them.

If hands aren't washed, the bacteria will be spread and could cause illness
