A 35-year-old married woman from Arizona who faked cancer and posed online as a 16-year-old girl to have sex with teenage boys has pleaded guilty to child molestation.

Jennifer Dempsey pleaded guilty on Friday morning to child molestation, attempted sexual conduct with a minor and sexual conduct with a minor.

She is accused of engaging in sex acts with a 14-year-old and 16-year-old in her car at a Phoenix park and at her home between November and January, and police believe she may have many more victims.

Phoenix police Sgt Trent Crump said the 
Dempsey also lied about being pregnant and for the past five years has 
convinced her family she is dying of cancer when she is perfectly 
healthy. He said she even attempted to use the fake illness to avoid 
arrest last week.

'She used her cancer ploy to our detectives to try and stay out of trouble,' Crump told CBS5 News.

'She said this is the reason why she didn't engage in the sexual conduct because she was constantly ill from chemotherapy, all of which we learned in the following days, was not true.'

According to Azcentral.com, Dempsey used various names to lure the boys on Facebook. When they came to her home that she shares with her husband, she told the victims the property belonged to her aunt.

Crump said Dempsey lied to both teens 
about being pregnant and even met with one of the boy's parents to 
discuss the fake pregnancy, which is how her plan was foiled.

After the meeting, the parents raised concerns about her age with police and also said they'd discovered nude photos of Dempsey on their son's cell phone.

Crump said incriminating text messages led to her arrest and a search of her home uncovered further evidence.

Dempsey has admitted having sex with the older boy but denies sleeping with the 14-year-old though police said statements she made when questioned corroborated claims she did engage in sex acts with him.

To keep the intricate five-year-long cancer hoax alive, Dempsey shaved her head, bought wigs and had a fake chemotherapy port taped to her chest to fool her relatives, Crump said. It is not clear what the motive for the fake illness was.

Neighbors told CBS5 they regularly saw the woman with a tube in her chest as she came and went from her condominium complex.

'It was my belief that she was very, very ill,' Carolyn Chavez, the office manager at Dempsey's apartment, told the news channel. 'She wore a tube all the time. We've had other residents with cancer and I thought she fit the profile.'

Another neighbor Elizabeth Slipek said: 'It really is shocking.'

'I can't believe somebody would go to great lengths to go to something like that. It's ridiculous, especially as an adult.'

Dempsey was arrested on February 7 at her home and booked into jail where she is being held on several counts of sexual conduct with a minor. She's scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 22.
