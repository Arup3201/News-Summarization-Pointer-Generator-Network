The parents of the six-year-old British boy killed in the Sandy Hook massacre said they are 'filled with love' for the women who died trying to protect him.

Nicole and Ian Hockley paid tribute to the teachers who 'selflessly' died when gunman Adam Lanza went on the rampage at the Connecticut elementary school.

The couple, who moved from England two years ago with Dylan and his eight-year-old brother Jake, said: 'Though our hearts break for Dylan, they 
are also filled with love for these and the other beautiful women who 
all selflessly died trying to save our children.'

'We will always be a family of four': Nicole and Ian Hockley have paid tribute to their son Dylan (left) who was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre last week. Also pictured is Dylan's brother, Jake

Dylan died in the arms of teaching aide Anne Marie Murphy, right, and 'loved' his classroom teacher Vicki Soto who was shot dead saving her students from gunman Adam Lanza

Dylan's parents also paid tribute to Sandy Hook Elementary School principal Dawn Hochsprung, left, and school psychologist Mary Sherlach, right, who helped the six-year-old with his special educational needs

Dylan was one of 20 students killed by Lanza.

Six staff also died including headteacher Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach.

Mr and Mrs Hockley said the pair were 'exceptional women' who helped them 'navigate' their son's special educational needs.

Dylan's teacher Vicki Soto died while saving her pupils. She hid them in her classroom closet and confronted Adam Lanza, telling them the children were at the other end of the school.

Six children panicked and tried to escape but the teacher put herself in the line of fire so she could save them, but they were all shot multiple times.

Mr and Mrs Hockley said their son's teacher was 'warm and funny' and Dylan 'loved her dearly'.

The couple also said they take 'great comfort' in knowing that their son did not die alone.

He was found in the arms of teacher's aide Anne Marie Murphy, who was also shot dead.

They said in the statement:  'Dylan loved Mrs. Murphy so much and pointed at her picture on our refrigerator every day.'

Dylan 'flourished' at the school and loved his teachers Vicki Soto and Anne Marie Murphy

Mrs Hockley, who is American, and Mr Hockley, who is British, moved into
a house on the same street as the mother of the shooter, Adam Lanza.

But despite the tragedy they said they did not regret moving to the 'beautiful community'.

They said they have been given 'strength' by the level of support from Sandy Hook and across the world.

The couple, who also thanked the emergency services, said: 'We feel the love and comfort that people are sending and this gives our family strength. 

'We thank everyone for their support, which we will continue to need as we begin this long journey of healing.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the other families who have also been affected by this tragedy. 

'We are forever bound together and hope we can support and find solace with each other.'

'Beaming smile': Dylan, pictured playing with Jake, was loved by everyone who met him

Remembering their son, Mr and Mrs Hockley added: 'Everyone who met Dylan fell in love with him.

'His beaming smile would light up any room and his laugh was the sweetest music.

'He loved to cuddle, play tag every morning at the bus stop with our 
neighbors, bounce on the trampoline, play computer games, watch movies, 
the color purple, seeing the moon and eating his favorite foods, 
especially chocolate.

'There are no words that can express our feeling of loss. We will always
be a family of four, as though Dylan is no longer physically with us, 
he is forever in our hearts and minds. We love you Mister D, our special
gorgeous angel.'

They said Dylan was learning to read and was 'so proud' when he read them a new book every day.
