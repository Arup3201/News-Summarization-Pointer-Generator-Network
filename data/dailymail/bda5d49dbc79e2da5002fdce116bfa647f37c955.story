Hundreds of mourners attended the joint funeral of a 'perfect couple' killed in a hit-and-run as they rode a tandem bicycle.

The two coffins of Ross and Clare Simons were adorned with white 
flowers and laid side by side in a hearse as it arrived at Westerleigh 
Crematorium in South Gloucestershire.

The couple died when their bicycle was hit by a Citroen Picasso car in Hanham near Bristol, less than 24 hours after they celebrated being given the go ahead to begin IVF treatment.

Tribute: Flowers spell out the name of 30-year-old Clare Simons, who was killed alongside her husband Ross

Mr Simons, 34, and his 30-year-old wife, who were described by friends as 'two peas in a pod', were hoping to start a new life together.

Family and friends, who were asked to
wear bright colours to reflect the couple's characters, fell silent as 
they caught sight of the hearse.

Dreams: Mr and Mrs Simons were hoping to start a new life together

Relatives hugged each other in support and wiped tears from their cheeks as they followed the wooden coffins into the crematorium.

They had asked those who attended the funeral not to bring flowers but to donate money to a Bristol IVF charity in the hope that it will give another couple the chance of having a child.

In a statement they said: 'Both families are sure this is what Ross and Clare would have wanted. Also, could anyone who attends make sure they wear bright colours, and no black.

'This is because Ross and Clare were both colourful and bright people. Ross and Clare have left a huge hole in the lives of everyone who knew them.'

During the service there were several readings and tributes to the couple who - as stated on the order of service - lived by the words 'Love, Laugh, Live'.

Their wedding song, Heaven, by DJ Sammy, was played along with Endless Love, which the family said gave people a time to reflect on Mr and Mrs Simons' love for each other.

At the end of the service the families and other mourners scattered white rose petals over the coffins.

Reverend Peter Cook, who led the service, said: 'At the end the coffins were completely snowdrift in white rose petals which was just a very beautiful thing.

'Ross and Clare were loved so much 
and I think it was a very beautiful service with people able to express 
that love for the couple.

Fitting tribute: Mourners were asked to wear bright clothing to the funeral as a tribute to the 'colourful' couple

'There were lots of stories told about Ross and Clare, they were a couple who lived life to the full.

'Ross loved wakeboarding and things, and there were stories of Clare collecting worms as a child. It was great, just that sense of their love of life.'

He added that the two families were dealing with their grief in different ways but had conducted themselves with dignity throughout.

'The family are very different and they are coping in different ways,' he said.

'Some are coping better than others, 
but it is one of those things, whoever they are, just taking one day at a
time and struggle through what that day brings.'
