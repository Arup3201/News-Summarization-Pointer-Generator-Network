With rain forecast from Thursday, those braving Glastonbury this weekend are clearly going to have to pack their wellies.

But for those wishing to escape the misery of the mudbath in store in a traditional tent, there is an oasis in sight.

This luxurious temporary hotel on the outskirts of the music festival has a four-bedroom suite that comes with its own butler.

The so-called ‘Tenthouse suite’ has three bathrooms, expensive rugs on top of the wall-to-wall carpets, antique furniture and sofas to take the weight off your feet.

With rain forecast from Thursday, those braving Glastonbury this weekend are clearly going to have to pack their wellies. But for those wishing to escape the misery of the mudbath in store in a traditional tent, the luxurious glamping site offers an oasis

The master bedroom inside a Tenthouse Suite certainly beats a leaky two-man tent anyday - especially with the luxury of fresh linen sheets, plump pillows, electricity points and internet access

For a cool £9,995 for the long weekend – tickets not included – the 2,000sq ft series of tents sleeps up to eight people and also comes with free spa treatments such as facials and pedicures.

Celebrities including singer Katherine Jenkins, model Cara Delevingne and actor Chris O’Dowd are all believed to have enjoyed ‘glamping’, glamorous camping, either here or at similar sites while attending the festival.

Guests at the Pop-up Hotel will also notice the difference compared to the other 130,000 campers at Glastonbury with the luxury of fresh linen sheets, plump pillows, electricity points and internet access.

The company, which also offers a more modest 16sq ft luxury tents with beds that comfortably sleeps three to five people, has an array of facilities including  a reception, 200-seater restaurant, bar, showers and make-up areas.

Tattinger champagne can be bought for £45 a bottle and every room it offers is decked out with floor-boards, rugs, wardrobes, LED lighting and large double beds.

Forget burgers and chips - at the Pop-Up Hotel flatbreads, and chicken, tomato and artichoke salads are the order of the day. Or perhaps a glass of Hennessy Cognac, for £5 a pop

The hotel also still has 'American-style' vintage caravans available that have a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and sofa to watch the festival in comfort on. They come with room service and cost between £6,000 to £9,000 for the length of the festival

Managing director Mark Sorrill said he had been inundated with late bookings since the weather fore-cast revealed it is due to rain most days during the festival in Somerset.

‘We’re all hoping for a nice and sunny Glastonbury and not have the problems of mud, but here you don’t get it,’ he added.

‘There is less people walking around as we’re just off the main Glastonbury site and there’s not the mud. We’ve been receiving loads of late calls with people wishing to upgrade and there are still a few different sizes of accommodation available.’

The sumptuous surroundings guests at the Pop-Up Hotel can enjoy are a far cry away from those experienced by the average Glastonbury festival-goer

Mr Sorrill came up with idea of creating the hotel after spending 12 years in property development in the Caribbean. After developing Indigo Bay, a thatched hut resort in Grand Cayman, the 44 -year-old decided to bring the idea home to Somerset, England.

He added: ‘Glastonbury 2011 is where the Pop-up made its first appearance, and it’s really taken off from there.

‘We really aim to design the tents and hotel to match the surroundings, so naturally for Glastonbury, we try and make the tents quite arty, but still very classic and British.

‘It takes 20 to 30 people around two and half weeks to set up the site for the festival.’

The hotel also still has ‘American-style’ vintage caravans available that have a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and sofa to watch the festival in comfort on. They come with room service and cost between £6,000 to £9,000 for the length of the festival.
