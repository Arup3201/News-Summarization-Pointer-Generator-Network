Stevan Jovetic was given an odd request on Sunday, as a London waiter begged him not to score against Liverpool... via a message on his restaurant bill.

The Manchester City forward hot-footed it to the capital after playing 67 minutes of his side's 1-1 draw at Goodison Park on Saturday and dined at posh west London restaurant Jak's Bar.

When the bill arrived at his table, Jovetic also had a message from his waiter, which read: 'Never score against Liverpool plz.', alongside the price of £0.00.

On Sunday March 1, at 12.00pm, Manchester City travel to Liverpool in the Premier League

Jovetic then uploaded a picture of the bill to his Instragram account, alongside three laughing emoticons.

The waiter, named on the bill as 'Basri', is thought to be a Reds fan, desperate for the Manchester City man not to repeat his feat from earlier in the season.

City hosted Liverpool in their second game of the Premier League season, where Montenegro striker Jovetic netted twice to help the champions to a 3-1 win.

Unless they meet in the fifth round of the FA Cup in February, the next chance the 25-year-old could have to net against the Reds will come in the Premier League at the beginning of March.
