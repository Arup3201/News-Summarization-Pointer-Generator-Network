Asprey worker Martin with the £80,000 bags

This may not be a question you've ever asked yourself, but how much would you be prepared to pay for a money safe shaped like a gorilla? A tenner? £100?

What do you mean they'd have to pay you to take the monstrosity home? Would it make a difference to discover that the gorilla is solid silver, hand-crafted by some of the finest silversmiths in the land, and on sale in a shop that epitomises the 'If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it' ethos?

The actor Samuel L Jackson fell in love with this, er, unusual piece on a trip to London. It isn't known if he paid the full price (celebrities often don't), but for a mere mortal to take it home would cost an eye-watering £55,000. 

The price of a solid silver gorilla safe is just one of the life lessons you learn from watching a jaw-dropping documentary that goes behind the scenes at Asprey, the jewellery and gift store to the rich and famous.

Austerity Britain this is not. One customer, who comes in to buy handbags, expresses an interest in some rings as she's about to leave. A particularly sparkling little gem  is placed on her finger. The price?  £4.6 million. That she doesn't have a heart attack tells you everything you need to know about the clientele.

A bona fide British institution, Asprey can trace its history back to 1781 and has been a presence on upmarket New Bond Street since 1847. It's held a Royal Warrant from every British monarch since Queen Victoria awarded it one in 1862, and everyone from Mae West to  the Beckhams has been a customer. And at one point the joke went that the Sultan of Brunei was the only customer, so lavish were his spending sprees there.

The last time Paul McCartney popped in it was because he needed a couple of dozen wine glasses for a party. Not that 'need' is a word much associated with Asprey.

Who 'needs' a solid silver cocktail shaker shaped like a rocket (£7,500), or a stag's head decanter – an Asprey bestseller at £2,500? 'It's not a case of  "I need one." It's a case of "I want one,"' says one staff member. 'And what people are buying is exclusivity.'

The staff are upfront about the fact that prices aren't emblazoned all over the shop. Mostly you need a magnifying glass to find one. One salesman talks about how you sell a champagne bath (it's a big bucket, basically).

It seems you don't scream about how it costs £30,000, you point out how long it took to make, and how it is a unique piece. By the time the question of 'How much?' comes up, he says, the customer is likely to think, 'That's just the thing for my yacht.'

In an age of mass-market consumerism, Asprey is something of a relic. It's still the place to go in certain circles for gifts though, and it's never too young to start. One can quite imagine Elton John and David Furnish practically moving in when they were doing up the nursery.

A solid silver baby hairbrush will set you back £265 (although you'd probably want the matching comb – £185 – too, so as not to look like a cheapskate). An egg cup shaped like a rocking horse costs £495, while a little tube to hold a birth certificate is £675.

The company made its name making intricate gilded travel cases for the discerning. The manufacturing process involved heating mercury to extreme temperatures – at which point it gives off deadly fumes. Dying on the job was an occupational hazard, and the average lifespan of the Asprey craftsmen, back in the day, was just 41.

These days the craftsmen and women who toil in the workshops may have dwindled to just a handful (due to a lack of demand rather than mercury poisoning), but they're still responsible for making and mending some of the world's most iconic pieces, including the Crown Jewels.

Watching them at work is awe-inspiring, and as a lament to the lost world of the British master craftsman this programme is as powerful as it gets. It can take months, even years, to craft some items, but in the modern world these are no longer skills that are valued.

One silversmith is filmed cleaning the toilets. His services doing the job he trained for were no longer required. Another, Stuart Greig, is filmed nervously stepping onto the shopfloor in his overalls, to hand over a necklace that will retail at £133,000. 'I'm a scruffy urchin. I feel out of place,' he says.  

Alas for the purists the market for near-priceless trinkets has evolved and the customers targeted today are likely to be film stars and footballers with an eye for the eccentric. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie even designed a range of jewellery for them called The Protector in 2009.

The fact that cameras have been allowed in for the first time shows that things are changing. Once Asprey was a byword for discretion and quiet opulence. But the company has had its share of tribulations in recent years.

Its own financial history is chequered; the firm posted losses of  £10 million in the mid-90s. The latest financial figures are healthier following a £50 million refurbishment by Lord Foster and a surge in demand from Middle Eastern customers.

The programme doesn't flinch from showing the challenges of keeping a company like Asprey afloat. An extraordinary project – the sale of 41 bespoke handbags – is launched while the cameras are there. These are off-the-scale high-end bags, some made from crocodile skin with 18-carat gold fittings and encrusted with diamonds. The most expensive is £80,000.

Special events are arranged to try to flog these handbags. High teas are laid on, but the sandwiches and macaroons remain uneaten. Treasured clients are invited but fail to turn up. Celebrity events are held.

After one month, only a couple of the bags have sold. Alex, the salesman charged with shifting them, starts to sweat. He works on commission, has a small child at home, and is now worried about having one of his 'bread and water months'. We cheer for him when a Saudi Princess swoops in at the last minute and buys a dozen.  

In some ways the programme lifts the lid on a preposterous world. There's a Texan tourist who's with a salt and pepper set shaped like The Owl And The Pussycat. Yes, yes, it looks as hideous as it sounds, but she absolutely won't hear of leaving without it.

The price? £6,995. One Oriental gentleman is warmly greeted – hardly surprisingly, since we learn he comes three or four times a year. He's looking for a watch and when he's told the price of the one he likes is £85,000 he buys two.

Will it make you wish your husband was the sort to pop into Asprey and ask them to help him choose your birthday gift? Yes and no. The gentleman who does this asks the saleswoman to model some earrings for him so he can choose.

She duly obliges. It's not a service you get in Argos, granted, but some might find it a bit, well, weird that while the birthday girl's earrings may have cost £15,750, they've also been in someone else's ears. Priceless.
