Director of football Andoni Zubizarreta has rubbished reports suggesting Luis Enrique was not Barcelona's first choice replacement for Gerardo Martino and has hit back at claims suggesting his side's squad are too old.

Enrique fielded six players in their 30s during Barcelona's recent 3-1 defeat in the first El Clasico of the season against Real Madrid at the weekend.

Xavi, Dani Alves and Claudio Bravo were among the players over the age of 30 who started at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.

The Catalan giants'  ageing side have been criticised since losing to Real Madrid which has angered Zubizarreta.

Zubizarreta, speaking to El Pais, said: 'It's a temporary issue because if we had played the likes of [Marc-Andre] Ter Stegen, [Marc] Bartra, Sergi Roberto and Rafinha then the average age would have come down noticeably.

'We have players in different age groups and we are not just leaving the team to grow old, although admittedly the players we signed in the summer were experienced ones, with the exceptions of Ter Stegen and Douglas.

'But we are building a team for a season, not just one match.'

The former Barcelona and Valencia goalkeeper said of Enrique's appointment at the Nou Camp: 'Luis Enrique was always first choice. Football is evolving and perhaps we needed to make some modifications in certain aspects.

'That is what we have done with Luis because we have raised the intensity and maintained the pressure higher up the pitch.'
