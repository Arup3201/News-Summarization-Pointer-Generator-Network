A McDonald’s waitress has claimed she was unfairly sacked for sprinkling too much chocolate on a McFlurry dessert.

Sarah Finch, 19, was fired for gross misconduct for giving extra chocolate topping to a colleague for the 99p ice cream.

She is taking the company that owns the McDonald’s restaurant where she worked to an employment tribunal.

Sarah Finch, 19, claims she was sacked by a McDonald's because she gave too many flakes of chocolate to someone buying a McFlurry

Before sacking her from her £180-a-week job, McDonald’s described Miss Finch as as an 'exceptional employee'.

Her bosses then accused her of giving her away food without payment.

The teenager said in a statement: 'I was dismissed on the grounds of gross misconduct. I was accused of stealing food.

'The matter was trivial, in that I provided a fellow employee, who was purchasing a dessert, a generous sprinkling of chocolate pieces.

'There is no standard for such measures - they are always imprecise and will vary among customers.

'My colleague had asked me: “Make it a nice one”.

Miss Finch said she was asked to make the McFlurry a 'nice one' for her colleague who was buying it

'So the measure I gave erred on the side of more than, rather than less than, the mean.'

Miss Finch worked at a McDonald’s in Carmarthen, west Wales, for 18 months.

She said: 'The issue was that I had done this in response to a specific request for someone I actually knew.

'Had it not been in response to a request, or it was someone I did not know, then I do not believe there would have been even a warning.'

Miss Finch, of Kidwelly, Carmarthen, said it was common practice for managers at the McDonald’s to give away food to unhappy customers.

Her application for unfair dismissal is against franchise company Lonetree who run a string of McDonald’s restaurants.

She has submitted her claim at the employment tribunal in Cardiff. A full hearing is due at a later date where she is represented by her mother Tessa.

Managing director Ron Mounsey confirmed he backed his manager’s decision to sack Sarah who is being represented at the tribunal by her mother Tessa.

Mr Mounsey, a renowned supported of youth employment schemes, refused to comment today.

But in a letter to Sarah’s mother, he said: 'I am aware of the circumstances of your daughter’s dismissal, where she has admitted giving away food to someone without receiving payment.

'This is classed as gross misconduct as per my employee handbook, the consequences is dismissal.

'My managers acted correctly according to my policies and I fully uphold their decisions.

'You may feel it is trivial, but with 740 employees in my business, if my management team were just to overlook such incidents then quickly it would become a free for all.

'This is and always has been a dismissable offence in my business.

'There are reminder notices in every one of my staff rooms reminding employees of this policy as well as the Employee Handbook.

'Employees are aware of the risk they take should they decide to do this. This will continue to be the case.'
