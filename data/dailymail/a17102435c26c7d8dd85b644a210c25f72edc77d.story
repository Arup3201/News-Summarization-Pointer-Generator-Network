Rescued from car boot sales and online auctions, these throw-back images from the 1950s and 60s showcase a long-forgotten Britain and highlight how this country has been changed beyond recognition in the space of a single generation.

Where once there was  a bustling city centre and a quaint family-owned chemist, there is now nothing more than a carpark and a charity shop.  

In one shot from the 1960s the Mayor of St Ives is seen strutting through the city centre dressed in his red robes of office, surrounded by officials decked in purple, medals from the all too recent First and Second World Wars pinned proudly to their chests.

By comparison a photograph taken in precisely the same spot today  shows a mass of parked cars, double-yellow lines, railings, benches, and parking machines - though the town's war memorial still stands tall.

Then: The Mayor of St Ives and town officials are pictured walking through the main square with medals, likely from service in the recent Second World War, pinned to their chests

And now: While the War Memorial still takes pride of place, little else has remained the same as car parking has been added, along with modern road markings, a parking machine, railings and benches

Quaint: Bryant's party shop is pictured next to family chemist (right) in St Ives while classic cars can been seen parked along the street

Today: The party shop has been replaced with a department store, while a charity shop occupies the site of the old chemist

This remarkable set of pictures, which would make even the most hardened heart long for the Britain of 50 years ago, was put together by collector and amateur photographer Martin Snelling.

But a second set of comparison photographs, taken half a century later, also reveals how much this nation has changed during those years.

If she were alive today, the Queen Mother would barely recognise a lawn in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, where she took a stroll outside an agriculture show in 1960s, in front of cheering crowds.

Today, the building has been transformed into a Toyota garage, while the lawn itself has been tarmacked over as a space to park the display cars. A small verge which borders the main road is all the greenery that is left.

The only thing that has hardly changed is the River Ouse cutting the same course as ever through the village of Hemingford Grey, nestled just below St Ives, where a group of leisure seekers were pictured rowing along in 1960. 

Time gone by: Old fashioned cars and a van for Smedley's Frozen Foods are parked along Bridge Street in the centre of St Ives

Modern Britain: A row of hi-tech cars sit along the much wider pavement, while the shops in the background have long-since changed hands

Out for a stroll: The Queen Mother waves to the crowds and amateur photographers as she walks on a lawn outside an agricultural fair in St Ives, Cambridgshire, in 1960 

Transformed: Another image taken of the same site today shows it has been turned into a Toyota garage, while the lawn has been covered with tarmac to provide space for the display cars

The old images, which portray a forgotten age in the years after the Second World War as Britain learned to enjoy itself once more, were among 200 60mm and 70mm slides Mr Snelling found on for sale on eBay. 

Old-fashioned shops line streets dotted with classic 1950s and 1960s cars, couples wear their finest clothes as they enjoy an al fresco meal on their patio and children flock in their masses to church for Sunday schools.

He has spent the past six months collecting more than 6,000 retro slides as part of an art project documenting the changing face of Britain.

In one of the more astonishing pictures Heathrow is seen without the modern-day entrance halls, shopping centres, jet planes and departure gates. Instead a single piece of tarmac is dotted with propeller-engined planes, while passengers walk across the runway on foot.

At a traditional country fair a car can be won for just one shilling, while a sign proclaims 'Please help us to help the spastics' - a dated term used to refer to sufferers of cerebral palsy. 

Taking a punt: A man and a group of women enjoy a leisurely day out as they row their way down the River Ouse, in Hemmingford Grey

Unchanged: The river is one of the few things that remains unchanged in half a century, winding the same path as always through the country

Happy as a sandboy: Two women and a young boy enjoy a day out at the beach at Hunstanton, Norfolk in 1960

Early days: A British European Airways flight is boarded by passengers at Heathrow in this colourful photo taken in the late 1950s

Scenic: Passengers casually lean out of the window of a steam train as it snakes through the Welsh hills in September 1958

The amateur photographer regularly picks up boxes of the pictures at auctions and car boot sales but bought the most recent batch  for £13.

He was sent two boxes of old slides but when he opened them up he found nearly all of them were all taken in St Ives.

Believing the pictures were taken by one man named David Bryant, Mr Snelling, 44, launched an online campaign to return the album to its original owner or his descendants.

He has now had contact with Mr Bryant's son, who has said he does not want to be reunited with the images. 

Sunday school: A large group of children gather for church school on a sunny day in Spring in St. Ives, Cambridgeshire in 1958

Artistic: Weathered boats docked in water near a church surrounded by trees at Hemingford Grey on the Great Ouse, near St. Ives

Al fresco: A couple enjoy a spot of lunch on the patio outside their home on a sunny day in St. Ives in April 1958

March: The Mayor is followed by a procession including a judge and a priest during the annual Mayor's Parade in St. Ives, 1960. The man with the top hat to the right of the vicar has been identified as Jack Bullen, town clerk of St. Ives at the time

He did not explain his decision, but told the photographer that he wanted to get rid of the slides and had actually dumped them in a skip himself.

Mr Bryant's son revealed his father and mother Molly as well as his sister Jane have all since passed away.

Now Mr Snelling is hoping to track down the faces in the photos and reunite them with lost glimpses of their former lives.

He said: 'There are other families involved who are in the photos and who I would like to get in touch with.

'There was a lot of information on these ones which helped me work out the people involved whereas other ones I collect have very little detail.

'It is a great feeling when you eventually reunite people with these childhood memories and I want to track down the faces in the pictures.'

The father-of-three, from Portchester, Hampshire, added: 'They show a lot of family moments like christenings, weddings and family holidays.

Quaint: A woman walks up a road winding parallel to the seafront at Bournemouth in this stunning picture taken in 1958

Commemoration: A group of  men march up Market Hill, St Ives, Cambridgeshire, in this picture captioned Battle of Britain Parade, from 1960

Wrapped up warm: A young girl wearing matching red gloves and wellington boots pictures in a garden in St. Ives in 1960

'The colours are amazing and still remain strong. They have been placed in glass and have obviously been in storage which has protected them from the light.'

He added: 'I think I was searching eBay one day because I was in a creative rut. I picked up some slides for about £3 and got addicted.

'I just thought it would be interesting to see how people and places had changed over the past few decades.

'My wife isn't best pleased because the house is now full of boxes of photographic slides.'

Break from the slopes: A group of skiers are seen relaxing and drinking outside a bar in Wengen, Switzerland in 1959 

Bargain! A car is offered as a competition prize, entry for which is just one shilling, at a fair believed to have been held at at Kimbolton School, Cambridgeshire. The sign 'help the spastics' is an outdated reference to cerebral palsy sufferers and is no longer acceptable to use

One of the particularly scenic photos was taken from a popular boathouse with upstairs tea rooms and a balcony overlooking the Geat Ouse. The boathouse was built by Ernest Giddins in the 1920s. 

After his early death, it was subsequently run by his brother Jack until it was taken over post-war by Jack's son Rodney.

Sadly, the wooden building required major renovation and restoration during the 1970s and the funds were not available to carry out the work so it had to be demolished.

In the late 1950s, a trip out on one of the boats would have cost around one shilling per hour or five shillings for the day.

Pensive: This photo dates back to May 1958 and was captioned as the Bournemouth Round Table Conference

Dated: A woman walks past Barton Chemist on Bridge Street, St. Ives, Cambridgeshire, in 1960

Mr Snelling bought the slides on eBay on January 2 from a man who found them at an auction in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. 

The seller knew nothing of their history so Mr Snelling posted the images on social media, and he now wants to identify the people pictured in the album.

Happy memories: This photo, captioned Brian & Daphne's Wedding, was taken on April 4 1958 in St. Ives, Cambridgeshire
