David Cameron admitted yesterday he should cut benefits and tax credits for immigrants more quickly to stop Britain being such a ‘massive draw’.

The PM was asked by MPs about what lessons he would draw from the Government’s failure to hit its net migration target.

Giving evidence to the Commons liaison committee he said: ‘The biggest lesson I would learn is we need to act more rapidly on the financial draw to Britain.

‘I think that the way the tax credit system and benefit systems work to make Britain a massive draw – not only because we’re creating so many jobs but also the financial draw – we needed to act on that faster.

‘I have made very clear pledges about what will happen in the next Parliament if I’m lucky enough to come to another one of these meetings.’

In 2010, Mr Cameron pledged to reduce net migration – the number of arrivals minus departures – to below 100,000.

But despite sharp cuts in the number of non-EU migrants, a surge in European arrivals means the figure has barely changed in the past five years.

The figure currently is 260,000 a year.

In November, Mr Cameron promised to stop EU migrants claiming in-work benefits, such as tax credits, and getting access to social housing for four years.

Child benefit and out-of-work benefits will also be curbed, he said. The measures will form the centrepiece of his proposed renegotiation of EU free movement rules ahead of a proposed referendum in 2017.

Some Tory backbenchers were disappointed by the speech because it stopped short of more robust action, including a temporary ban on migrants – the so-called emergency brake.

It emerged that No 10 dumped the idea after German Chancellor Angela Merkel made it clear it would not win EU support.

The Tories are expected to keep the net migration target as part of their election manifesto.

Last month Mr Cameron said Britain would be a ‘better, stronger country’ if the number of immigrants was cut.
