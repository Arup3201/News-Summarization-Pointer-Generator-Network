An ISIS-linked Egyptian terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the killing of an American oil worker in August this year.

William Henderson, 58, died while working for Texas-based energy company Apache Corporation in Karama, Egypt on August 6th this year.

Militant organization Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, which now refers to itself as the Sinai Province, has posted pictures of Mr Henderson's passport and two identification cards on its Twitter, but has not specified when or how they killed him. 

Claiming responsibility: ID-cards and passport of oil worker William Henderson, who died in Egypt in August this year, has been posted by an ISIS-linked militant group in Egypt claiming responsibility for his death

The ID-cards posted by Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, identifies Mr Henderson as an employee of  Apache Corporation and Qarun Petroleum Co., a joint venture with Egypt.

An obituary published in a local Oklahoma newspaper at the time of his death, say Texas-born William 'Bill' Byron Henderson had 'passed suddenly' while working in Egypt.

The obit said Mr Henderson, a married father-of-two who had left Oklahoma for Fayetteville, Arizona in 2010, had worked for Apache for 28 years. 

The U.S. embassy declined to comment on the militant group's claim, and Apache could not immediately be reached for comment.

Apache said in August that one of its supervisors had been killed in an apparent carjacking in Egypt's Western Desert, but did not identify William Henderson.

Ansar Beit al-Maqdis has carried out scores of attacks, including a suicide bombing on a tour bus in the south Sinai resort town of Taba, that killed three South Koreans and their local driver in February this year

'The victim was a long-time employee who works with production operations and we are deeply saddened by his death,' Apache spokesman Bill Mintz said at the time, adding that Apache was working with Egyptian authorities and investigating the death.

Mr Mintz said the attack had taken place Wednesday August 6th, as the employee was driving in the desert between Qarun and Karama, southwest of Cairo and had been killed by gunfire.

Egyptian security officials said the Apache worker's body was found in a car on a road outside Cairo with another foreigner who had been working with the Egyptian government-owned company Qarun Petroleum.

The second person's citizenship was not immediately disclosed, nor was it made  clear if the second person was killed or still alive when the body of the Apache worker, believed to have been Mr Henderson, was found.

Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, a Sinai-based jihadi group, has carried out scores of attacks mainly targeting Egyptian security forces, particularly since the July 2013 overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. 

Last month it pledged allegiance to ISIS, which controls vast swaths of Syria and Iraq.

In a separate statement late Sunday, the Egyptian group claimed to have carried out more than 10 attacks in the past four weeks.

It said it blew up six army and police armored vehicles, killed seven police officers and conscripts, and demolished the house of a man accused of being a spy for the army.

The northern part of the Sinai Peninsula has been under a state of emergency since the group attacked an army checkpoint in October, killing 31 soldiers.
