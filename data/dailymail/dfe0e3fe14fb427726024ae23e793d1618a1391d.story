Aged 13, she was given her first journal by her mother in the summer of 1832.

Now, more than 180 years later, the early diaries of the future Queen Victoria are to go on show at Windsor Castle.

In the books, the then-Princess speaks of the 'friendliness' of locals in the 'desolate, blasted and black' Midlands following the Industrial Revolution.

She also comments on her school timetable, which saw her undertake lessons in history, geography, Latin and general knowledge.

The diaries are among an array of royal treasures to go on display in an exhibition celebrating 100 years of the Royal Archives.

Queen Victoria, who is Britain's longest serving monarch, was given her first journal by her mother, the Duchess of Kent, in August 1832 as they visited Powis Castle in Wales.

The Duchess encouraged her daughter to record her impressions of the places they saw as they attended a series of educational tours across the country.

Passionate writer: During her lifetime, the Queen even kept brief diaries in Hindustani - 13 of which survive in the Royal Archives today. She began to learn the language with the help of Mohammed Abdul Karim (pictured)

During the tours, the Princess was met with an unfamiliar sight of the newly industrialised Midlands, prompting her to write: 'The men woemen (sic), children, country and houses are all black.

'But I can not by any description give an idea of its strange and extraordinary appearance.

'The country is very desolate every where; there are coals about, and the grass is quite blasted and black. I just now see an extraordinary building flaming with fire.'

However, despite her bleak surroundings, the future Queen was apparently charmed by the people she met, writing, 'We have just changed horses at Wolverhampton a large and dirty town but we were received with great friendliness and pleasure.'

In 1832, the Princess recorded her school timetable in her journals, revealing she would spend half an hour at 9 o'clock each morning writing in her diary before undertaking a variety of lessons.

The monarch's early diaries mark the beginning of a passion for writing that would last a lifetime, seeing the production of more than 43,000 pages within 141 journals, as well as vast amount of personal and official correspondence.

It was the Queen's legacy that in 1914 prompted the creation of a permanent home for all documents relating to the Royal Family and Royal Household.

Dedicated: Britain's longest-serving monarch continued to keep a diary until her death in 1901

As well as recording her thoughts and observations of daily life in her personal journals, Queen Victoria corresponded frequently with members of her family in Britain and throughout Europe.

She also communicated with ministers, ambassadors, heads of state and the Church.

The monarch even kept brief diaries in Hindustani - 13 of which survive in the Royal Archives today.

She began to learn the language ten years later after being made Empress of India in 1877.

She was taught by one of her Indian servants, Abdul Karim, who later became her Indian Secretary and Munshi.

Queen Victoria continued to keep a diary until her death death in 1901. Only 13 of the original volumes survive, dating from 1832 to 1836.

Upon the Queen’s instructions, her daughter, Princess Beatrice, produced abridged copies of the remaining volumes, destroying the originals.

In 1912, Queen Victoria’s grandson King George V decreed that ‘All the Royal Archives shall be kept...in the Round Tower’, and in 1914 the transfer of the records to their new home in the Round Tower at Windsor Castle began.

The monarch's first journal is among more than 100 items featured in the book Treasures from the Royal Archives, which is being published by Royal Collection Trust on Saturday, May 17.

It is also one of 25 documents being exhibited at Windsor Castle until January 25 next year.
