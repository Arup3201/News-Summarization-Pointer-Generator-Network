A favourite chef of The Queen who headbutted a colleague in a drunken rage during a party at the Buckingham Palace staff living quarters has been handed a community order.

Adam Steele, 28, was popular with the Royal Family and was regularly requested by Prince Philip to cook for his guests.

But the experienced sous chef was sacked after he left his friend and colleague James Thompson 'bleeding profusely' after telling him he was going to 'f*** him up' during a party at the Palace's staff accommodation.

He had downed ten cans of lager and four shots before suddenly turning aggressive and launching the unprovoked attack on October 17.

Steele pleaded guilty to common assault at an earlier hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court and was given community service and a fine today.

Prosecutor Izolda Switala-Gribbin said: 'The defendant and victim were chefs working together at Buckingham Palace. On the day in question, Friday the 17th of October, they were having a party at the premises.

'The individual had some alcohol on the night in question and they were playing games.

'At some point he was seen becoming aggressive towards Mr Thompson, who asked the defendant if he was OK before he headbutted the victim in the face and was swinging punches at him.

'He had a split eyebrow and was bleeding profusely from his nose and eyebrow area.

'Prior to headbutting the complainant, the defendant said I'm going to f*** you up.'

'He was being aggressive for no apparent reason and there were complaints about his behaviour becoming difficult when consuming alcohol in the past.'

Ms Switala-Gribbin said that after his arrest Steele told officers he had drunk 'eight to ten cans of lager and three or four shots of spirits'.

'He couldn't remember the incident and admitted to it being stupid.'

Edward Jones, defending Steele, told the court his client had been dismissed from work over the assault and was still looking for a job.

He said: 'He has no previous convictions and does display remorse. He realises what he did was incredibly foolish and very costly for him. He let himself down very badly on this occasion.'

Mr Jones added that Steele had 'lost a friend' in Mr Thompson over the incident and had tried to apologise to him in person.

Magistrate Christina Townsend ordered the chef to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work over the next 12 months.

He was also made to pay £200 compensation to Mr Thompson, £85 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

She said: 'This offence is so serious it should be dealt with by a community order.'
