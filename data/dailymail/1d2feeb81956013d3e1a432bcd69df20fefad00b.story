This stunning series of photographs offer a bird's eye view of the moment a great grey owl swooped on a tiny field mouse. 

The bird, which has a five-foot wingspan, stalked the rodent from snowy treetops in Ontario, Canada, before launching its attack. 

Its eyes never straying from its prey, it made a somewhat inelegant landing in the snow before scooping up the mouse with its claws. 

The great grey owl is a deadly predator, its hunting skills aided by its superior sense of hearing.

Its soft feathers allow the bird to glide unheard, taking its prey by surprise. 

Photographer Marc Latremouille captured this particular encounter during one of his photography workshops.
