It seems there is nowhere Google Maps hasn't reached, from mountain tops to ocean floors.

But now the map has offered a new service, letting culture vultures tour 13 iconic National Trust properties from the comfort of their own homes. 

A collection of historic country houses and outstanding landscapes from the UK have been added to Google Street View in partnership with the National Trust.  

St Michael's Mount; This iconic rocky island is home to a community of just over 30 islanders and boasts its very own subtropical garden and legend of Jack the Giant Killer

Lyveden New Bield; The Tresham family who owned the estate were involved in the infamous Gunpowder Plot

Trelissick Garden; Trelissick is situated on its very own peninsula with ever changing views of the estuary of the River Fal

The sites that can be toured include Montacute House, which will represent Greenwich Palace, Henry VIII's main London seat and the site of Anne Boleyn's arrest, in the forthcoming BBC Two series Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies.

Stourhead House, the inspiration for Lady Penelope's residence in the original Thunderbirds puppet series in the 1960s and Formby, one of the only places in the UK where the rare red squirrel can be spotted.

Tom Barker, head of digital at the National Trust, said: 'We're delighted to team up with Google to showcase online some of the special properties and places we look after on behalf of the nation.

'At the heart of our charitable purpose is the principle of opening up the countryside and the historic homes in our care to everyone, forever. It's great that this technology will allow so many people wherever they are in the world to get a taste of what visiting some of the nation's most beautiful places is like.' 

Montacute House; Montacute has been used for filming before – The Libertine and Sense and Sensibility. In the forthcoming BBC Two series Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies the Elizabethan mansion represents Greenwich Palace, Henry VIII’s main London seat and the site of Anne Boleyn’s arrest.Montacute also has the longest portrait gallery in England

Kedleston Hall: The main house was never intended to be a family home , but instead a canvas to showcase the Curzon’s family art collection

Formby, in Liverpool, is one of the only places in the UK where the rare red squirrel can be spotted

Brownsea Island; This was where the Scouting Movement first started and inspired Enid Blyton in her writing of the Famous Five

Tyntesfield; Family fortune was founded on guano (bird droppings). It was also rumoured that Kylie Minogue was keen to purchase the house when it originally went up for sale

Hardwick Hall; It was built at a time when glass was a very expensive material so it was known as ‘Hardwick Hall, more glass than wall.' Bess of Harwick rose up to become the second richest woman in Elizabethan England

Stourhead House; Stourhead house was the inspiration for Lady Penelope’s residence in the original Thunderbirds puppet series in the 1960s.The Temple of Apollo, at Stourhead, was used as the location for a rain-drenched dramatic exchange between Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet in the 2005 remake of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice starring Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen.

The images were taken earlier this year using the Google Trekker – a four-foot, 40lbs backpack, fitted with a 15-angle lens camera, taking 360 degree pictures every 2.5 seconds – which is designed to capture imagery in locations that the Street View car can't typically reach.

The images have been processed and carefully stitched together by Google to give a seamless 360 degree view of the various buildings and parts of their grounds and landscapes where accessible. The routes at each location were designed in conjunction with the Trust.

The 13 iconic landmarks are: Montacute House, Lyveden New Bield, Attingham Park, Stourhead House, Tyntesfield, Brownsea Island, Formby, Trelissick Garden, St Michael’s Mount, Sizergh Castle, Hardwick Hall, Kedleston Hall and Brockhampton Estate.
