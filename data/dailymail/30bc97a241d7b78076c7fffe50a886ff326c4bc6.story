James Turner Street: The Birmingham street made famous by a Channel 4 documentary for the amount of benefits claimants living there is now also the worst place to live near to get car insurance

Postcodes around the city’s infamous James Turner Street - catapulted to stardom by the Channel 4 series ‘Benefits Street’ - make up the majority of black-listed areas.

Insurers said Britain’s second city also has the highest number of bogus whiplash claims - which add £90 to every motorist’s bill.

In a survey of all UK cities by SmartWitness Incident Cameras, it found Birmingham’s motor insurance premiums are now seven times higher than Aberdeen - the UK’s cheapest city for car insurance.

The price of insuring a BMW 3 Series in Bordesley Green, Birmingham B9 - the worst postcode found - was £1,101.62 per year compared with Aberdeen city centre which comes in at only £157 for the same car.

The next nine postcodes are all in Birmingham - and most are within just a few miles of James Turner Street.

Overall Birmingham has more than a fifth of the worst 100 postcodes for motor insurance premiums in the country - 22 in total.

Aberdeen £156.98 Plymouth £170.43 Bristol £177.03 Oxford £186.55 Edinburgh £187.05 Carlisle £187.51 Cambridge £187.60 Lancaster £194.47 Brighton and Hove £195.06 Norwich £198.61 Glasgow £199.35 Exeter £200.50 Sunderland £213.94 Portsmouth £215.36 York £229.91 Dundee £232.57 Derby £237.36 Southampton £237.60 Gloucester £239.10 Nottingham £253.15

The second worst city in the UK for car insurance is Liverpool with 17 of the top 100 with East London third, with 12, and Manchester fourth, with 11.

North London take fifth place with nine in the top 100 followed by South East London with seven, Bradford with six and Sheffield with three.

Insurance figures were calculated for a 43-year-old married man with three children, working as a retail account manager and owning his own home and parking on the street.

He drives a £20,695, BMW 318 2012-2014 Diesel 2.0L Manual 4 doors D SE, and does around 6,000 miles a year.

SmartWitness managing director Simon Marsh said: 'Part of the reason for the sharp increase for the car insurance premiums is that Birmingham has become the capital of whiplash claims in the UK.

The six top areas for Third Party Injury (TPI) claims are all in Birmingham and it’s no great surprise that those neighbourhoods mirror very closely those with the highest premiums in our survey.'

The top five areas with the highest number of third party injury claims were B8, B12, B10, B9 and B6.

Simon said: 'Most insurance experts have said that whiplash claims have cost motorists around £90 a year in increased premiums.

'Over 40 percent of motor insurance claims are contested but only two percent of SmartWitness claims are, so you can see that having reliable video evidence practically eliminates bogus whiplash claims.'

Other UK cities with high numbers of TPI claims are Bradford with four of the top 20 worst postcodes, Manchester next with three, and Liverpool and London have one each.

The cities with low TPI claims also had the lowest insurance premiums. Several of Scotland’s cities had the lowest premiums in the UK and also the lowest number of TPI claims.

Aberdeen had three postcodes in the top 20 lowest areas for TPI claims - and is the cheapest UK city for car insurance.
