Second wife: Jonathan Agnew, pictured with his second wife Emma, has spoken out about his relationship with his children from his first marriage

The familiar voice appeared to break as Jonathan Agnew spoke about his two daughters from his first marriage.

‘My relationship with my kids is the one sad area of my life,’ the cricket commentator lamented yesterday in an emotional moment on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs.

Agnew, the voice of BBC cricket, told presenter Kirsty Young of the ‘tough time’ he had maintaining his relationship with Jennifer and Rebecca after his divorce from their mother Beverley.

The 52-year-old former England fast bowler, affectionately known as Aggers, went on to say he wanted to ‘stand up’ for absent fathers in broken families who want to play a part in their children’s lives.

And he described how he and his second wife Emma had made a ‘conscious effort’ to ensure that her former husband maintained a relationship with his children from that marriage.

Yesterday, however, the first Mrs Agnew insisted it is the BBC cricket correspondent’s ‘own fault’ that he doesn’t have a better relationship with Jennifer, 27, and 24-year-old Rebecca.

She said: ‘He has had the opportunity to see and be with his children any time he chooses. He’s been in control of that. So, if he hasn’t taken part in their lives that’s been his choice.

‘He’s never been stopped from seeing his children and I don’t think I’ve made it difficult at all.’ Mrs Agnew, 56, who owns a child care centre in Leicester, said her former husband has provided for her children financially but has not been there emotionally.

She said: ‘I think he feels if he’s done financial stuff he’s done his bit as a dad, but actually kids just want some time.

‘He thinks he can buy them a nice Christmas present and they don’t need to be spoken to for a few months.’

Perhaps the most stinging criticism came from Agnew’s own daughters who claim to have felt like ‘an embarrassment’ to their father once he remarried.

Rebecca, who works with her mother, said: ‘If it wasn’t for Mum we wouldn’t have a relationship with him.

'We’ve felt very unimportant since Dad married Emma – pushed out. We always felt like an embarrassment. We’ve both wanted to be part of his life but we’ve just never felt involved.’

Jennifer, a veterinary nurse, added: ‘Because we didn’t have much of a relationship when we were young, it’s difficult now we’re adults.

‘He doesn’t know anything about me now. He has a much better relationship with his stepchildren than he does with us.

'He’s been forgiven for a lot. He’s been given multiple chances.’

Test Match Special broadcaster Agnew was apparently astounded that his daughters were not among those listening to him on the radio.

Mrs Agnew said: ‘He said to me once, “My children have no idea who I am and what I do” – because they didn’t listen to the cricket on the radio.

'I said, “You are their dad and what you do is irrelevant”. He thought his children should listen to the cricket to know what he did but it’s not really the kind of thing girls like is it?’

Mrs Agnew said she ‘gave up everything’ to be with the cricketer after meeting him when he was on tour with his county team Leicestershire in her home country of Zimbabwe.

He joined Test Match Special in 1991 and Mrs Agnew said their ten-year marriage, which ended in 1993, was ‘difficult’ because he would be abroad for months covering games.

She added that her former husband has let his daughters down ‘repeatedly’ over the years, missing school pick-ups, parents’ evenings and sports days.

Mrs Agnew said: ‘Jennifer had a school concert when she was about ten or 11. He only came back from abroad that day.

'He turned up at the concert, came late, sat down and his daughter sang one of her four songs and he got up and walked out because he was tired.

‘I was looking at her face and the disappointment... It would have been better had he not come at all. You can’t explain that to children.’

Agnew married Emma in 1996 and became stepfather to Charlotte, 22, and 19-year-old Thomas.

The commentator said yesterday he was ‘proud’ that he and Emma had helped her first husband, Brian Dodds, keep in contact with his children.

He told how Mr Dodds, a solicitor who died of motor neurone disease in 2005, would enjoy family meals with them and even go on holiday with them.

But his first wife insists she too had done all she could to help her daughters keep in contact with their father.

She said: ‘I even went and had Christmas dinners with them where I joined his new family so the children could see him, which was a very uncomfortable situation for me. I had to bury my pride on many occasions.’

Mrs Agnew added: ‘His relationship with his children is on and off. They’re both adults now so they’re old enough to have their own relationship.

'Jenny’s just been for a job interview which he knew about but hasn’t bothered to ask about.

‘He always said I should remind him of these things. It’s not for me to be his secretary. He can pick up the phone.’
