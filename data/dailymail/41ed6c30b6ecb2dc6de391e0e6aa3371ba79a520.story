A Republican congressman in Texas asked Ted Nugent, who has referred to President Obama's administration as 'evil' and 'America-hating,' to attend the State of the Union address with him- and the rocker has accepted.

Rep Steve Stockman of Texas said Monday on his website that Nugent will be his guest for the president's speech on Tuesday night. 

Stockman has previously spoken of impeaching Obama over his gun control and immigration proposals, and has numerous sections of his website that say 'Obama vs Texas.'

Nugent, an NRA boardmember, has not made his opposition to Obama's gun control push a secret. Stockman's website also identifies Nugent as a supporter of his campaign.

In a speech to the NRA during the 2012 campaign, Nugent said that if Obama were re-elected, he would either be 'dead or in jail.'

In the incendiary speech, Nugent urged supporters to vote for presumed Republican nominee Mitt Romney and called Obama 'vile,' 'evil' and 'America-hating.'

He also compared the Obama administration to a 'coyote' that should be shot. And on election day, he said encouraged his supporters to 'chop [Democrats'] heads off.'

But neither dead nor in jail, the 'Cat 
Scratch Fever' singer will be in the crowd as Obama delivers his remarks
before a joint session of Congress.

Nugent
tweeted on Monday: 'Well well well, there will be a freedom addicted 
all American uppity Motown guitarplayer facing the POTUS at the SOTU 
addresss tomoro-lovely.'

Nugent's comments led to meetings with representatives of the Secret Service.

Rep Luis V. Gutierrez said another guest would be Gabino Sanchez of South Carolina. 

Gutierrez described Sanchez as a husband, father and an illegal immigrant fighting deportation.

The president will press a politically-divided Congress to approve more tax increases and fewer spending cuts, as well as an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws and tighter gun measures.

The agenda Obama will outline Tuesday before a joint session of Congress will include more money for infrastructure, clean energy technologies and manufacturing jobs, as well as expanding access to early childhood education.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama would outline 'his plan to create jobs and grow the middle class' as the nation struggles with persistently high unemployment.
