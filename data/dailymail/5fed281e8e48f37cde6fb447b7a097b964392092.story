The private household of King Herod has been laid bare in a new exhibition being held at a museum in Israel.

Herod the Great: The King's Final Journey at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem features exhibits that offer an intriguing glimpse into the home life of the divisive figure, including his bath and the decorations that adorned his palace.

The 250 artifacts were excavated over a period of 40 years at Herodium, the builder-king's excavated palace on an arid hilltop a short drive from Jerusalem.

Museum staff have recreated sections of the palace to house the exhibits, including a mock-up of the tomb where King Herod was laid to rest and contains what experts believe is his excavated sarcophagus.

There are also numerous busts and statues, as well as a one-piece stone bath excavated from the hot bath house at the site.

They come from the period when the Romans occupied the Holy Land and appointed Herod the monarch of Judea.

Herod, who ruled in what is now Israel and the West Bank for over 30 years and died in the year 4 BCE, was known for elaborate palaces and fortresses.

He is branded a baby-killer in the Christian tradition but remembered by many in Israel for rebuilding the Jewish Temple two millennia ago.

However, the opening of the exhibit has provoked a modern-day row between Israel and the Palestinians over who has the right to dig up his artifacts.

Palestinians have complained many of the exhibits were taken from the occupied West Bank, land Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which Palestinians seek as part of a future state.

Palestinians said the artefacts were removed without their consent.

The Palestinian minister of tourism and antiquities, Rula Ma'ayah, said all Israeli archaeological activities in the West Bank were illegal.

'Many dig locations (in the Palestinian territories) fall under Israeli control ... and we are unable to reach them. All the work at digs in the occupied territories are against the law, but Israel carries them out and even if they don't dig themselves they don't allow us to do so,' he said.

Israel Museum director James Snyder said archaeological digs on West Bank land were carried out according to international conventions and protocols laid down in interim Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.

Snyder said he was unaware of any discussions with Palestinian archaeological officials over the exhibit and there had been no way to study the artefacts properly on site at Herodium.

The relics, he said, would eventually be returned to Herodium once proper facilities to house them were in place.

In the Christian story, Herod ordered his men to kill all baby boys in and around Jesus' birthplace Bethlehem, fearing one would grow up to become 'King of the Jews' and challenge his rule.

According The Gospel of Matthew, Jesus and his family escaped the slaughter by fleeing to Egypt.

Historians said Herod ruled Judea from about 37 BC until his death in 4 BC - four years before Jesus' official birth day, though that date is also contested.

King Herod has been called as 'the greatest builder of human history,' but was also responsible for killing his wife and three of his children over alleged treasons.

He rebuilt the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem and was also renowned for other grandiose construction projects, such as the fortress at Masada.
