The message from the Aston Villa fans was all too clear as they crashed to another defeat: 'We want Lambert out,' they chanted.

There was some murmuring of discontent during last week's narrow 1-0 FA Cup win over Blackpool but nothing like this with boss Paul Lambert also taunted with 'You don't know what you're doing' after he substituted Carlos Sanchez.

In the end Villa fell to Paul Konchesky's goal just before half-time but it could easily have been a lot more as Leicester showed they have the fight to stay in the Premier League.

For Konchesky it was a moment to remember, as he drilled home after nemesis Alan Hutton had failed to clear Leo Ulloa's hopeful cross.

It came only a month after the former England left back was sent off – later rescinded – for clashing with the right back at Villa Park and this was another fiery encounter with Matty James and Ciaran Clark both sent off late.

Marc Albrighton made only his second start for Leicester following his summer move from Villa as Nigel Pearson opted for an attacking system with Anthony Knockaert occupying the other flank and Ulloa and Dave Nugent operating up-front.

It was the hosts who defied their league position to take control of this game with Nugent seeing an early shot deflected wide from Danny Simpson's cross.

Leicester really should have taken the lead on 13 minutes from a delightful break. Knockaert's powerful long ball was well controlled by Albrighton whose run picked out Nugent who somehow sidefooted wide with Knockaert also queuing up to score behind him.

Pearson's side missed another good chance as Nugent headed wide from almost on the goal-line as Ulloa headed on Knockaert's cross.

Villa could have capitalised on Leicester's failure to take advantage of their early chance as Gabby Agbonlahor caught the home defence napping but shot well wide.

Then Tom Cleverley saw an effort deflected into the hands of Ben Hamer, preferred in goal to Mark Schwarzer, from the edge of the area while Jores Okore blazed well over from Ashley Westwood's corner.

But Leicester finished the half strongly with Nugent seeing a volley from the edge of the area come back off the bar with the headed rebound from Ulloa going over.

They got their goal in the first minute of stoppage time to Konchesky's delight. It was his fifth goal in 146 Foxes appearances.

Leicester continued where they had left off at the start of the second half with Brad Guzan spectacularly saving to keep out Matty James' header from Albrighton's cross.

From the resulting James corner Westwood's header nearly went into his own net.

Villa fans had had enough as they chanted 'we want Lambert out' and they cheered ironically when Christian Benteke shot tamely at goal.

They had Guzan to thank again when he saved well from Albrighton who had burst through to run onto a Nugent pass.

Villa were fortunate not to concede a penalty as Westwood appeared to foul Ulloa in the area as he shaped to shoot from Knockaert's pass.

Sub Tom Lawrence missed another good chance for Leicester blazing over from more hold up play by Nugent.

But it did not matter as Villa – with just 11 goals in 21 Premier League games this term – never looked like scoring.

There was drama late on with James sent-off for a tackle on Jores Okore while Ciaran Clark was dismissed for a second booking for his part in the ensuing melee. 

James and Clark appeared to clash as the players made their way towards the tunnel.
