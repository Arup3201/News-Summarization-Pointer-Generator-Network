Whether you're standing in an airport security line or waiting at a crowded gate, it would be nice to take the load off your feet while travelling sometimes.

Now a company using Kickstarter to fund its new invention hopes people will be able to do just that with a handy seat that's so small it fits in a back pocket.

The Sitpack is a compact seat made of a strong type of plastic often used for bullet-proof glass or Lego, which folds out into a seat on a stick.

Take a seat: The fold-away chair has raised more than £90,000 on Kickstarter and would sell for £30

Designer Jonas Lind-Bendixen says the idea for the Sitpack (right) came four years ago, when he was waiting for a band to come on stage. It folds into the size of your back pocket (left)

The product - which would retail for $50 (£30) - enables people to rest their legs and back by transferring their weight to the seat attached to one long pull out leg.

Danish company Mono+Mono recently introduced the Sitpack, and the team behind its design has to date raised more than 812,000 kroner (nearly £90,000) on Kickstarter with three days to go in its campaign.

Creator Jonas Lind-Bendixen says the idea for the Sitpack came four years ago, when he was waiting for a band to come on stage and thought about how people are often left standing for long periods of time, leading to an aching back and legs.

The monopod comes in various different colours to suit all tastes (left) and even the packaging is cool (right)

The designer calls the product a 'monopod' and it is so small it literally fits in your pocket when folded up. 

'Ive been doing sports most of my life, and through the sports I've accumulated various small injuries in my knees, back and so forth,' Lind-Bendixen said.

'All this waiting that you expect when you go to watch sports, go shopping with your girlfriends or travel. You wait for several hours at a time, which can be quite uncomfortable.'

Designed to fit in the back pocket, the Sitpack can travel pretty much everywhere in a pocket or bag

Folded up, the Sitpack is 6.6 inches tall and 2.6 inches in diameter. 

To extend it, the user pulls out both sides of the horizontal seat and pulls down on the monopod, or extending 'leg'. 

The Sitpack is height-adjustable and can extend to about 34 inches tall. 

The seat itself, when extended, is 13 inches in diameter and supports a weight of up to 20 stone.

When sitting on the device, the user must keep their feet on the ground just like with a traditional shooting stick. 

Balancing is therefore required but Lind-Bendixen insists this doesn't take much effort and supports correct posture.

So does the Sitpack mean an extension of our sedentary lifestyles?

'It is better to stand up than sit down,' Lind-Bendixen acknowledges. 'But the thing is, how long is it better to stand up? When you stand for a long time, it's inevitable that your lower back will start aching. 

'Your body is tired, and gravity does take its toll on everybody, so you need to sit down at some point. This kind of bridges the gap between sitting and standing all the time.

'With the Sitpack, because you're so high, you don't sit with all of your weight on it. You move all the small muscles, and you can keep your energy levels higher [than when sitting on a chair], especially when you wait three hours in the same spot.'

The developers plan to have the product on sale by April 2015. 

What Sitpack says on Kickstarter: 'For the first time ergonomic seating is truly portable, inconspicuous enough to use in public and exceptionally functional. 

'Sitpack lets you enjoy all the benefits of portable resting without being a burden to bring along.

'Imagine if you could pop out a foldable seat when your back and knees starts aching, watching your favorite sports or concert. Imagine not having to carry a clumsy chair with you when going hunting, fishing or bird watching.

'Remember standing in 2+ hour passport lines after 8 hours of flight or waiting for delayed transportation.

'NOW, IMAGINE: Having a seat in your pocket that will help you stay focused and active, keeping you in eyeheight with your standing friends, while being inconspicuous enough for nobody to notice!' 

People who want to contribute to the product's manufacture can visit the Kickstarter website for the next three days only.
