Power couple: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in Sydney last week. The Oscar-winning actress was reportedly spotted house hunting in Marylebone

They already own a sprawling Los Angeles home and a 35-bedroom French chateau - and now Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are thought to be looking for a base in London.

The Oscar-winning actress was spotted house hunting in Marylebone, according to reports, sparking rumours that the Hollywood power couple could be looking for a new home.

If they do buy in the upmarket area, they will be moments away from celebrity hotspot the Chiltern Firehouse - where Jennifer Aniston, Princess Beatrice and Kylie Minogue have dined this month.

Jolie has looked at homes priced at up to £20million, a local source told The Sunday Times. 

Earlier this week it was revealed that a number of lavish apartments have gone on sale in the area, part of a new property development called The Chilterns. 

One four-bedroom penthouse - which boasts David Bailey artwork and an in-house chef - is on the market at £25million. 

Perks include an on-site gym and a 24-hour hotel-style concierge which will take care of everything from travel arrangements and theatre tickets to dry cleaning and shopping. 

And a neighbouring plot, designed by top architects Squire & Partners, is on the market for £12.6million. 

It is not yet clear whether Jolie and Pitt are planning to move with their six children to London permanently.

Their main home is Chateau Miraval, their sprawling estate nestled in an ancient village in the south of France. 

The property is surrounded by a moat, and boasts a spa, two gyms, and an indoor swimming pool. 

The couple chose the stunning chateau as the venue for their private wedding ceremony - attended by just 22 guests - this summer.

If they do splash out on a London home, they will be the latest in a string of A-listers to snap up property in the UK.

Last month it was reported that the couple's close friend George Clooney bought a multi-million-pound riverside home in Oxfordshire for his new bride Amal Alamuddin. 

The facilities they can enjoy include a state-of-the-art spa complex and a cinema room. 

And Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence was reportedly looking at a number of multi-million pound properties in London's trendy Belsize Park. 

MailOnline has contacted Angelina Jolie's representative for comment.
