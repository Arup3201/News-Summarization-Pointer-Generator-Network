Thousands of supporters braved the wind and rain yesterday to provide a massive show of strength for Boxing Day hunts.

More than 250,000 turned out to celebrate one of the highlights of the countryside calendar in the face of growing anger over the hunting ban.

Campaigners claimed 6,000 gathered to meet the Heythrop Hunt in Oxfordshire. Earlier this month, David Cameron's local hunt became the first to be convicted of illegally killing foxes in a prosecution brought by the RSPCA.

Although hunting for foxes with hounds is illegal, drag hunts using scented trails are still permitted.

In Chipping Norton, where riders 
gathered for a traditional 'stirrup cup' amid cheers from supporters, 
Stephen Lambert, chairman of the Council of Hunting Associations, said: 
'For all the nonsense talked by opponents of hunting, real people are 
showing real support for this hunt and the 300 others meeting all over 
the country.

'When the hounds rode off down the High Street the cheers from the crowd brought a tear to quite a few eyes.'

Chairman of the hunt, Mikey Elliot, 
praised the 'sense of community' around the Heythrop and branded the 
RSPCA prosecution – which led to a £4,000 fine – 'corrupt bullying'.

At the annual North Cornwall Foxhounds in Camelford a mother was injured when a horse slipped and fell on her.

Onlookers say the woman's daughter was on the horse, called Honeybell, when it suddenly spun round, fell, and landed on top of her.

Witness Peter Glaser said: 'The horse slipped and fell on top of her. Paramedics arrived to treat her and she was wrapped in a blanket to keep warm. It must have been a nasty shock.'

Elsewhere, a spectator was taken to 
hospital with a head injury after she was kicked by a horse at a hunt in
 Rivington, near Bolton. The 63-year-old was airlifted to hospital at 
the start of the Holcombe Hunt meeting.

The Heythrop, which Prime Minister David Cameron has ridden with, was recently the subject of a 
£327,000 private prosecution by the RSPCA.

Two
 members of the Heythrop Hunt  - Richard Sumner and Julian Barnfield - 
admitted unlawfully hunting with dogs on four separate occasions.

According to the Countryside Alliance over quarter of a million people turned out for the biggest day in the hunting calendar, despite the ban on hunting with dogs passed under Labour in 2005

 was ordered to pay a fine of £1,800 plus £2,500 in court costs while 
Barnfield was ordered to pay a £1,000 fine and £2,000 in costs. Heythrop
 Hunt Ltd was fined £4,000 and ordered to pay £15,000 in costs.

To
 avoid breaking the law, most of the gatherings practice trail-hunting 
where huntsmen follow a trail laid with a rag steeped in a fox-based 
scent.

The ban on hunting with dogs was passed under Labour in 2005, but many say the law as it stands is unworkable.

Barney
 White-Spunner, Executive Chairman of the Countryside Alliance, said: 
'Today has been an extraordinary display of support for hunting right 
the way across the country.

'Those hundreds and thousands of people 
have sent a clear message to the government.

They understand the 
difficulties of coalition government and the serious issues facing the 
nation, but this law is flawed and it has failed.'

However supporters of the ban say the
 majority of Britons want it to stay including most Labour and Lib Dem 
MPs and some Conservatives.

Joe
 Duckworth, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports said the 
organisation is spending £1m on recruiting investigators working to 
catch people hunting illegally.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: 'Three quarters of people in this country want to see fox hunting stay illegal.'

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson appeared to rule out bringing the issue before the Commons next year saying there is no imminent prospect of a parliamentary vote on repealing the ban.

Mr Paterson, a keen supporter of country sports including hunting, told the Daily Telegraph: 'There's only a point having a vote if you're going to win.

'At the moment, it would not be my proposal to bring forward a vote we were going to lose. There needs to be more work done on Members of Parliament.'

He went on: 'It is our clear intention to have a free vote but we need to choose an appropriate moment.'

Campaigners say enforcing the restriction wastes police time, and suggest some officers turn a blind eye to breaches of the law.

But David Cameron has been accused of
 dragging his heels over acting on the coalition agreement promise of a 
free vote on overturning the ban.

Many Tories would support repeal, but most Labour and the Liberal Democrats are still in favour of the ban.

For Labour, shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh said there was no public support for ending the hunting ban.

'Most people back Labour's ban on hunting wild animals with dogs and accept there is no place for animal cruelty in a civilised society,' she said.

'People are worried about their incomes falling, prices rising and losing their jobs, yet this out of touch Tory-led Government wants to bring back hunting.

'After the recent high profile conviction of members of the Prime Minister's hunt, I hope that hunts will respect the law this year.'
