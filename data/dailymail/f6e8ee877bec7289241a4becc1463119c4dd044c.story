A young woman is breaking traditional perceptions of 'tomboys' by combining her career in sports with entering the world of beauty pageants.

While Codie Applebee loves nothing more than having her blonde locks tended to by hairdressers and enjoying a weekly manicure, her path to the finals of Miss England is very different from most.

Unlike other beauty queens, she’s not afraid to break a nail or get her perfect spray tan covered in mud when she she plays professional ladies football twice a week.

Codie says her love of football started at a young age when she used to play in the garden wit her father

Codie has been so successful in the pageant world that she has now reached the finals of the Miss England competition

Student Codie, 17, from Leicester, plays centre midfield for West Bromwich Albion ladies’ squad - and regularly faces trips to A&E following spills on the pitch.

Her rather masculine career hasn’t stopped Codie from reaching the finals of national beauty pageant Miss England however, and the teen is hoping to carry away the crown.

Although she’s training as a hairdresser, working part time in a beauty salon, Codie would love nothing more than to win a scholarship to an American football academy - and play football for England.

Codie said: 'All my friends see me as a typical girlie girl - I love my hair extensions, fake tans, and trips to the salon as much as any of my friends.

'But they don’t understand why I’m so keen to go and get covered in mud down on the football pitch at the weekend.

Codie is equally as happy giving her all on the pitch as she is getting a manicure and competing as a beauty queen

Codie says she hopes to inspire other young girls to pursue football through her work in the pageant

'Sometimes men expect me to be a bit of a bimbo, and can’t believe I want to watch the football with them, but I usually end up explaining the offside rule to them.

'I have loved football ever since I used to have kickabouts with my dad when I was about five or six. He got me really into the game, and now I love it as much as he does.

'But we’re the only two in our family who are really interested in footie - all my cousins and uncles aren’t really that bothered about it.

'I’ve been so excited about competing in Miss England, and I was thrilled to get through the semi finals.

'I was a bit worried, as I had a nasty fall on the pitch a couple of weeks before, and I was worried my arm was going to be in a sling while I was competing - luckily it was ok though.

'I really want to help raise the profile of women’s football and encourage other girls to go out and give it a try.'
