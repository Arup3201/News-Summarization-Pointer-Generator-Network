JK Rowling nearly killed off Harry Potter or one his two best friends midway through writing the books, the writer has revealed.

Halfway through the wildly popular series, Miss Rowling said she 'seriously' considered 'polishing one of them off'.

And it was ginger-haired joker Ron Weasley who seemed the most likely candidate for the axe, Miss Rowling admitted in a no-holds-barred interview with the star of the films, Daniel Radcliffe.

The British author, who is apparently worth Â£530million, said she considered having Ron die 'out of sheer spite'.

She said she had never originally intended to kill off one of the three main characters, and thought the fact she even considered it showed she 'wasn't in a very happy place' at that point.

'I think in my absolute heart of heart of hearts, although I did seriously consider killing Ron, I wouldn't have done it,' she told the actor in their interview on a new DVD.

A fan wrote on The Leaky Cauldron fan site: 'Ron cannot die because he's Hermione's true love.'

Another said: 'Well she killed off three of my favourites: Sirius, Snape and Dobby, so I suppose I should be grateful she didn't kill Ron.'

Miss Rowling served up some brutal treatment for some of her best-loved characters.

and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry's uncle Sirius Black perishes in the
fifth, The Order of the Phoenix.

Harry's owl, Hedwig, dies in the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

'Funnily enough, I planned from the start that none of them would die,' said the author in the special feature on the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 DVD.

The interview was leaked online ahead of the DVD's release later this year.

The writer goes on to say: 'Then midway through, which I think is a reflection of the fact that I wasn't in a very happy place, I started thinking I might polish one of them off.

'Out of sheer spite: "There, now you definitely can't have him any more."

'But I think in my absolute heart of heart of hearts, although I did seriously consider killing Ron, I wouldn't have done it,' she added.
