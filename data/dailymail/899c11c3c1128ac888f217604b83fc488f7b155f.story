The UK financial markets yesterday suffered their biggest one-day loss in a year amid fears over the ebola virus and global economic concerns.

As America’s health authorities warned about the spread of the disease, an alarming slump on the London Stock Market was followed by a dramatic dip on Wall Street.

Millions of shareholders, including the big pension funds, were left with heavy losses last night after stocks fell, wiping as much as £46billion off the value of Britain’s biggest listed companies.

The FTSE100 index of leading shares in London tumbled by as much as 2.8 per cent, or 181.04 points, to close at 6211.64, its biggest plunge in a day for a year. It has lost 10 per cent in the last week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.64 per cent or 267.31 points to 16047.88 in late afternoon in the US after plunging as much as 450 points earlier in the day.

In a terrible day for world markets the spread of ebola combined with a raft of negative developments caused what dealers described as a perfect storm. In the US, the fall in the Dow gathered momentum after the US Center for Disease Control said it was not clear how a second worker had contracted the virus.

Officials have said they also don’t know how the first health worker, a nurse, became infected. The Federal Center for Disease Control and Prevention said ‘an additional health care worker testing positive for ebola is a serious concern’.

Fears over a political crisis in bailed-out Greece and gloom over the outlook for the American economy caused investors to cut their losses and sell.

Markets were also spooked by disappointment after stagnation in the eurozone, a slowdown in China and unexpected falls in the global oil price.

Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: ‘Carnage on the markets today as European markets hit by a perfect storm of disappointment over the health of the economy in Europe … as well as ebola.’

In France the Cac was down 3.25 per cent while in Germany the Dax fell 2.5 per cent.

Ebola survivor Will Pooley has said he is preparing to go back to west Africa to help deal with the epidemic because it is ‘something I need to do’.

The volunteer nurse, from Eyke in Suffolk, said there was an urgent need for strong medical support as the virus has claimed almost 4,500 lives, mainly in west Africa.

Mr Pooley, 29, made a special appearance at a training and discussion session in Whitehall for NHS workers who have volunteered to help on the ground with the international effort.
