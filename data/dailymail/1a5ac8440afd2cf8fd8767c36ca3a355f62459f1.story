Indianapolis Colts linebacker Joshua McNary has denied allegations that he raped a woman at his apartment after the pair had met during an evening of heavy drinking in early December.

McNary was taken into police custody on Wednesday night after charges of rape, criminal confinement with bodily injury and battery resulting in bodily injury were filed against him.

On Thursday morning, McNary's attorney, Edward Schrager, released a statement in which he said his client ‘unhesitatingly denies all accusations made against him.’

Indianapolis Colts linebacker Joshua McNary has denied allegations that he raped a woman at his apartment after the pair had met during an evening of heavy drinking in early December

‘Following the public release of these allegations, Joshua immediately reported to law enforcement officials in a respectful and peaceful manner,’ read the statement.

‘The charges and affidavit publicly disseminated on Wednesday afternoon are not evidence of wrongdoing, but simply one side's story.’

The statement went on to say that McNary believes the matter should be addressed in court rather than in the media.

The Colts had issued a statement on Wednesday saying they were aware of the allegations - but did not immediately suspend 26-year-old McNary. 

The player, who has been with the team since 2013, currently remains listed as active on the team's roster for Sunday's AFC Championship game.

According to the probable cause affidavit, two Indianapolis police officers said a 29-year-old woman accused an unknown man they later determined to be McNary of attacking her in the early morning hours of December 1.

Police, according to the report, determined the man was McNary after investigating a cellphone the woman claimed she took from the man's apartment.

'At one point, the female can be heard crying and becoming emotionally distraught,' the report said. 

Police reported that a nurse found dried blood behind the woman's ear and other injuries following a sexual assault examination, and that a friend of the accuser played a 2-minute voicemail from the women for police. 

The woman, whose name was redacted from the document, claimed the two engaged in a 'physical fight' and that she scratched his neck, face, back and shoulder before the alleged sexual assault took place. 

In the report, police said the woman also picked McNary's image out of a group of photos.

The police also wrote that when they arrived at McNary's apartment to investigate, McNary said: 'I know why you're here.' The report said McNary claimed to have preserved evidence because he expected the police would be coming.

McNary has been with the Colts for two seasons after finishing his college career as Army's career leader in sacks and tackles for loss. 

The Rice incident, along with a spate of domestic abuse cases among players including Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson, brought down a firestorm of public criticism on the most popular U.S. sports league

He spent two years on active military duty to fulfill his commitment before signing with Indy in 2013. He had 20 tackles during the regular season and no tackles in the playoffs, and still serves in the National Guard as part of his military obligations.  

The Colts issued a statement saying they're aware of the allegations.

'Unfortunately that's the limit of our knowledge,' the team said. 'At this time we are very concerned and trying to find out what the relevant facts are, but we have insufficient information to venture any opinion. As we learn more we will make appropriate updates.'

According to the report, the woman also said she believed the man slapped her on the left side of her face with his hands before forcing himself on her.  

Since the alleged incident, McNary has played in four regular season games and two playoff games for the Colts, according to NFL.com.

McNary attended West Point played football at Army before signing with the Colts as a free agent in April 2013.

The charges against McNary come a day after an independent probe found the league failed to properly investigate a domestic assault incident in which running back Ray Rice punched his then-fiancee on an elevator in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

The Rice incident, along with a spate of domestic abuse cases among players including Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson, brought down a firestorm of public criticism on the most popular U.S. sports league.
