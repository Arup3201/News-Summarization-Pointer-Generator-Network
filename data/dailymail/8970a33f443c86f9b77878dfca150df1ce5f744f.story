Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale lead the celebrations as Real Madrid took to the streets of the Spanish capital to celebrate their Champions League victory over city rivals Atletico.

The Real players celebrated with fans in the early hours on Sunday morning on an open top bus in Cibeles Square in Madrid just hours after the 4-1 win in extra time.

Carlo Ancelotti and his players headed straight back to Madrid after the final in Lisbon and the celebrations went on long into the night.

Team captains Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos shared the honour of draping a team flag around the neck of the Cibeles statue in the centre of the fountain in the square. 

Music blared from a makeshift stage kept supporters going until around 6am, when the Real team, wearing 'La Decima' on their shirts in reference to the 10th title they had coveted for 12 years, finally arrived back with the trophy.

It could have been so different after Diego Godin put Atletico in front nine minutes before half time, and Diego Simeone's side looked destined to get their hands on the trophy but Sergio Ramos popped up in the 93rd minute to send it to extra-time.

The crucial moment came five minutes into
 the second period of extra-time when Bale nodded home at the far post 
after good work from Angel Di Maria. Disappointingly for Atletico, they 
collapsed after that, with Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo making it 4-1 
to take the title back to the Bernabeu for the tenth time in their 
history.

Bale – who signed from Spurs in the summer for £86million - insisted that he and his team-mates always believed they could come back to win, despite being behind for most of the final.

'For us when we play our own football we win matches and it was literally just about attacking and keep doing what we do best,' Bale said.

'We believe in that and we believed if we kept doing that we would win.'

Man of the moment: Ramos scored the goal that sent the game into extra time

During normal time it looked like being a frustrating evening for Bale, with the former Spurs winger missing three decent opportunities, but the Welshman was pleased to see his efforts rewarded in the end.

'I've learned from past experience to just keep going, forget about the chances you've missed, and keep persevering. Thankfully I got the decisive goal,' he added.

'It was great to see it go in.'

With the Champions League triumph rounding off his first year at Real Madrid, following his world record £85million move last summer, the 24-year-old now has an appetite for more success.

'I came here to play in big competitions and win trophies. We want to win more now,' he said.

'This is what every footballer dreams of and it doesn't get any bigger in club football.'
