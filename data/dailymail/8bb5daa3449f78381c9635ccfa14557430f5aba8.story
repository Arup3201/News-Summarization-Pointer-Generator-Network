Prosecutors say Valdez had been living with the couple in the basement apartment for about six months on the condition he would go to school, work and contribute to household costs.

When he failed to do that, his aunt told him he needed to move out of the North Kildare Ave apartment, angering the teen, according to the Chicago Tribune.

On Christmas Eve, Valdez was allegedly home drinking while his aunt was at a party and Diaz-Hernandez was visiting family members.

When Diaz-Hernandez came home to find there was no beer left in the house, he went to a nearby drugstore with Valdez.

Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Kingsley Sawyers told a bond hearing that Valdez hid a hammer by the apartment's door before leaving.

When the men returned home, Valdez allegedly picked up the hammer and struck Diaz-Hernandez  in the back of the head.

Sawyers said the man fell and Valdez struck him up to 10 more times. Valdez then covered the windows, played loud music and began hacking the man's body with a butcher's knife.Â 

Prosecutors say Valdez then put the head, ears and nose on his aunt's bed 'as he, quote, 'Wanted to leave his aunt a present',' Sawyers said.

According to an arrest report, police who responded to the home early on Christmas Day found Valdez sitting in the front yard holding an iPad.

When one officer asked, 'What's going on?' Valdez allegedly replied, 'Shouldn't you arrest me before you ask me questions?', the Chicago Tribune reported.

When the officer asked why he should arrest Valdez, the teen allegedly replied: 'Because I just killed a man, and he's in the basement,' before slamming the iPad to the ground.

He also allegedly told police he would have also killed his aunt if she had witnessed the attack.

He has been ordered held without bond.
