Tim Sherwood says he is being told lies as another manager is strongly linked with his position at Tottenham.

Current Ajax manager Frank de Boer is the latest to be connected with the role, having recently declared himself open to speaking with Spurs - despite the club themselves denying that any approach has been made.

Sherwood, who signed an 18-month contract in December when he took over 
from Andre Villas-Boas, spoke of his frustration at the continued 
undermining of his position at the club.

'When clubs come out - and managers too - it’s disappointing. Somewhere along the line someone is telling porkies.

'We’ll
 see where the discussions at the end of the season take us. It’s a 
difficult time when there are outside distractions but I have to 
concentrate on the job in hand.

'My office is on the field. I think it’s gone reasonably well for me in the Premier League but we’ll just have to wait and see.'

De Boer is one of the hottest young managers 
in Europe, having led Ajax to four consecutive Eredivisie trophies since
 he took over the role in 2010.

‘Spurs haven’t had contact with my agent yet. They have approached Ajax, but that’s it,’ he said.

‘Spurs have let Ajax know they would eventually talk to me when the season’s finished.

Reunited? De Boer could end up managing Christian Eriksen again at Spurs, who left Ajax last summer

'After the last league game (against NEC on Saturday) I’ll think about it.’  

Tottenham’s
 interest in the 43-year-old brings up the sensational possibility of 
Dennis Bergkamp joining his colleague in north London.

The
 former Arsenal star is currently De Boer’s assistant at the Amsterdam 
Arena, and the pair have formed an incredibly strong working 
relationship.
