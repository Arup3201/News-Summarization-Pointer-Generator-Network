Two Southern California girls who vanished during a weekend sleepover were found near their hometown, police said late Monday.

Raylynn Bolt, 12, and Diana Tourdot, 14, were found by police in San Bernardino, about 15 miles away, Riverside police Sgt. David Amador said in a statement Monday night.

Police did not say anything about the girls' condition or provide any other details about them or their reappearance, saying only that they would be returned to Riverside and interviewed by detectives there.

Police said earlier that the girls most likely ran away during the Saturday night sleepover at Diana's home.

People had reported seeing the pair together near a city plaza on Sunday, Amador said earlier.

Family members and police using bloodhounds had searched for the girls after they vanished.

'Unfortunately I think these two girls just got into a little bit of trouble,' Donald Bolt, Raylynn's father, told KABC-TV.

He said the family gets along and enjoys video games and other activities.

The girls were spending the night at Diana's home. Her mother said she fell asleep around 11 p.m., heard a noise around midnight and woke up at 6:30 a.m., when the girls were gone, Donald Bolt said.

Tourdot's parents reported that the bedroom window was ajar.

Bolt's grandmother Sandy Brown told KTLA she dropped her off at Tourdot's home Saturday afternoon and that the two girls planned to go to the mall afterwards.

From there, she has no idea what 
happened. She received a call from Toudot's parents the next day 
informing her that the two girls were missing.

'It's
 not like my granddaughter to do something like that. She loves school. 
Today's a school day, and she's not going to be here to do school,' she 
said.

Bolt's cellphone pinged Sunday in nearby Corona at the 91 Freeway and McKinley Street but all calls went straight to voicemail.
