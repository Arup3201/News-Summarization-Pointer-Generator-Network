As the king who thought nothing of killing off an inconvenient wife or rival, his place on the history curriculum is assured.

But few would single out Henry VIII as a role model.

Which is why Education Secretary Nicky Morgan was facing ridicule last night after a bizarre interview in which she singled him out when asked to name her favourite monarch.

Nicky Morgan said the controversial king was her favourite monarch in the interview with politics website ConservativeHome, but opted for Elisabeth I on advice from aides after her first choice prompted surprise

The reign of Henry VIII, pictured,  was dominated by his break from the papacy, and he is said to have carried out large numbers of political executions – 330 in the years 1532-40 alone, with some estimates up to 72,000

‘Well I love the Tudor period. I think Henry VIII,’ she said.

The minister quickly withdrew her choice when aides and her interviewer on the politics website, ConservativeHome, expressed their surprise.

She said: ‘Shall I change that to Elizabeth I? A strong female monarch at a time when there weren’t many examples.’

Henry’s reign was dominated by his break from the papacy and the establishment of a reformed, national church.

But he carried out large numbers of political executions – 330 in the years 1532-40 alone. A contemporary chronicle says he had 72,000 people killed, although the true figure is likely to be much lower and in line with other monarchs in troubled political and religious times.

Henry’s most famous victim was the second of his six wives, Anne Boleyn, who he had accused of adultery. He also had his fifth wife, Catherine Howard, beheaded for being ‘unchaste’.

A Conservative campaign for new grammar schools came under fire yesterday – from the Tory Education Secretary.

Nicky Morgan said she ‘was not sure that separating people at the age of 11’ would improve social mobility or transform education. She insisted instead that she wanted all the country’s state schools to do well.

Her comments come after senior party figures called for an expansion of grammar schools to be included in next year’s general election manifesto.

Home Secretary Theresa May and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon have backed plans for new ‘satellite’ grammar school campuses in their constituencies.

Kent county council has asked Miss Morgan to approve its plans for an extra grammar school to meet demand in Sevenoaks, Mr Fallon’s constituency.

Earlier proposals were rejected by Mrs Morgan’s predecessor Michael Gove.

Mrs Morgan told the ConservativeHome website it was wrong to think that the only way to get access to good state education was to reintroduce grammar schools: ‘I would push back on that and just say actually we want all of our state schools to be good and outstanding.’ 

His inner circle were never safe and Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell were among many courtiers and nobles put to death in a reign that ran from 1509 to 1547.

Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said Mrs Morgan’s choice showed appalling ignorance of British history. ‘Henry VIII is a figure more akin to Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader,’ he said.

‘He was a tyrant. He was responsible for the executions of thousands of people.

‘He used to burn Protestants and Catholics in the same place, on the same day, alongside each other.

‘What a fool Mrs Morgan is. It’s laughable. She has to be kidding. It’s someone who doesn’t know her history.’

Asked in the interview to name her political heroes, Mrs Morgan chose Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev and FW de Klerk, the last apartheid ruler of South Africa. 

The two men were ‘prepared to take on the system, having been elected or appointed in that system’, she said. 

Mrs Morgan was also asked if this country was in need of glasnost – the policy for openness in government institutions in the Soviet Union.

She replied: ‘The Westminster system, there’s no doubt about it, people want to know honestly from their politicians about what can change and what can’t change and why we’re doing things. They want to know what motivates us to be making change.’
