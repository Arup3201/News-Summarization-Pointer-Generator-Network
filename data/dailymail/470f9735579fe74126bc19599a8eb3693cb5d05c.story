A stray Tabby who was rescued last week has given birth to 11 kittens just days before Christmas.

Donatella gave birth to the large brood yesterday, less than one week after arriving at her new home at the Cats Protection's adoption centre in Bridgend, South Wales.

One of Donatella's kittens was stillborn but vets say the remaining ten newborns are in good health following their mother's five-hour labour.

The adorable kittens were born after Donatella went through a five-hour labour yesterday 

Donatella, thought to be aged one, was handed into the charity last week after a householder who had been feeding the cat noticed she was heavily pregnant.

Vets say it was lucky Donatella was handed in when she was, in time for the gruelling labour.  

Cats Protection's Clinical Veterinary Officer Beth Skillings said: 'The large litter is in itself unusual, but for so many to survive the birth is exceptional. 

'Late pregnancy is very draining even for cats in good health, so for an underweight stray like Donatella it would have been particularly gruelling.

'First time mums usually have smaller litters, so it's possible Donatella may already have had a litter, despite being so young herself.

'It's hard not to find Donatella's story heart-warming, especially at this time of year.

Donatella, believed to be aged one, was handed into the charity one week earlier, after a householder who had been feeding her noticed she was heavily pregnant

'But it's important to remember this is not a fairytale - Donatella was a stray who has been through quite an ordeal to carry and give birth to so many kittens.

'She is lucky that someone noticed her and handed her into us as it is likely that many more of her kittens would have perished otherwise.'

Cats usually give birth to an average of three to six kittens. Larger litters often result in high rates of stillbirth. 

According to Cats Protection, the world's largest litter was born in 1970 when a Burmese/Siamese cat gave birth to 19 kittens. Four were stillborn.
