I was walking down the corridor of The Grove, one of the nicest hotels I’ve ever been in, looking for my room.

Across my arms I had some England training kit, I was a bit like the Gavin and Stacey character Smithy played by James Corden in that Comic Relief sketch when he stumbles upon the England squad.

The important difference was that I was actually in the England squad. The painter and decorator from Bexleyheath had hit the big time.

Called up: Jimmy Bullard with England team-mate David Beckham on international duty

I walked up and down the corridor, 292, 294 . . . aha, got it! Room 296. The temporary abode of England footballer Jimmy Bullard.

I wiggled my key card into the door and turned the handle, but nothing happened. So I did it again. And again. And again.

If I had to go back to reception carrying all this gear because I can’t get into my room, they’d probably throw me out for being too blinking thick.

I gave it another go and, as I wiggled the card in the slot, I heard someone coming down the corridor — hopefully a member of hotel staff who could get me into my room.

I couldn’t make out who it was from a distance, although they were also carrying gear so it must be another player.

The figure finally emerged from the shadows of the corridor and my heart skipped a beat when I realised it was David Beckham. Goldenballs! He was going to think I was a right spanner.

‘I’ve heard about you,’ said Becks as he got close enough for me to hear him. ‘I suppose that’s my room, is it?’

‘Naah, no, no . . . ’ I replied, but before I could say any more Becks looked up at the door number and down to the envelope for his key card and said: ‘It is my room!’

I looked at my envelope and saw that it said 269, not 296.

What a 
total donut. To make matters worse, I immediately felt guilty for no 
reason. ‘I know you think I was going to do something in there, but I 
wasn’t, honestly,’ I kind of pleaded.

Becks grinned at me and replied: ‘Go on, hop it you!’

I was so embarrassed, completely mortified.

As I went off towards my room I kept thinking: ‘He’s never going to believe that I wasn’t trying to pull some kind of prank.’

Becks and I had a little bit of previous which would certainly have raised his suspicions.

It all stemmed back to a pre-season trip I’d been on with Fulham a  couple of years before.

We were staying in the same plush hotel as Real Madrid, who Becks was playing for, and we were playing them in a friendly.

For the entire six days I put everything - a round of golf, some golfing gloves, buggies for a few of the players, I even treated myself to a new Vokey wedge and lots of drinks - on our gaffer Chris Coleman’s room.

I’d clocked his room number when we checked in. Room 206. I hadn’t been there long but I thought: ‘This will be a classic.’

Later, we were all in the bar and so were a few of the Madrid lads, including Becks and Raul.

‘Right lads, what are you all drinking?’ I said as I proceeded to order one of the most enormous rounds of drinks in history.

Feeling
 pleased with myself, I called Becks over for a chat, although my 
team-mates were reluctant as if they were somehow scared of him.

But they were soon back when I asked about the rumours that he’d had an affair with the Beckhams’ former nanny Rebecca Loos.

‘What’s happening with Loosy and all that then?’ I said to him. ‘Come on, open up!’

He started to laugh. ‘To be honest, she fancied Victoria, not me!’ was his reply.

We all started to laugh. ‘That’s a great “Get Out of Jail Free” card, that is, Becks,’ I said. ‘Don’t give me that, what’s the true story?’

But he told us he was being serious. We laughed even more.
