A disabled man has finished the Chicago Marathon more than 16 hours after it began.

Maickel Melamed, 38, completed the marathon in 16 hours and 46 minutes at 1:30am Monday. The average completion time is about four hours.

Surrounded by supporters chanting his name, Venezuelan Melamed crossed the finish line to whoops and cheers, the very last of 45,000 runners who participated.

Melamed suffers a rare muscular condition similar to muscular dystrphy.

His condtion, generalized muscle hypotonia, was caused by a complication during birth from nuchal cord, which occurs when the umbilical cord becomes wrapped around a fetus' neck.

Hypotonia causes low muscle tone, which makes most activities that require any strength extremely difficult for sufferers.

Doctors told Melamed's mother he would never walk.Â 

Endurance: The Chicago marathon was Melamed's third; he completed the New York Marathon in 2011 and the Berlin Marathon in 2012

Melamed began running marathons two years ago, successfully completing the New York city Marathon in 15 hours and 22 minutes after two years of training in his hometown of Caracas.

Today, with an entourage of almost 30 people, Melamed finished the 26.2-mile course in Chicago.

It was his third marathon, having already competed in New York City in 2011 and the Berlin marathon in 2012.

Accomplished: Melamed is also an economist, psychotherapist and motivational speaker

'If you dream it, make it happen. Your life is the most beautiful thing that can happen to you. So, make the best of it,' Melamed said after the marathon.

The inspirational long-distance runner is also a motivational speaker, economist and psychotherapist.

In 2006, Melamed climbed Venezuela's highest peak, Pico Bolivar.

He also has run the New York and Berlin marathons, and hopes to run the marathons in Tokyo and Boston.

Melamed has said he takes on these challenges to show young people all over the world anything is possible if you put your mind to it.

The winner of the Chicago Marathon was Kenyan Dennis Kimetto, who finished the course in two hours, three minutes, 45 seconds.
