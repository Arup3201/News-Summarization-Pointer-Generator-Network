A woman has been rescued after she was swallowed by a three-metre deep sinkhole and submerged in water while hanging out some washing.

The 53-year-old cleaner was assisting an elderly woman in her Springvale home in Melbourne's south-east when the ground gave way beneath her at around 11:30am, the Herald Sun reports.

Paramedic Stephanie Palamberis said that at one stage the woman's head was submerged underwater.

The sinkhole may appear small in width, but authorities said it was actually at least three metres deep

A 53-year-old cleaner was assisting an elderly woman with her washing when the ground gave way beneath her at about 11:30am

'The woman states that she was hanging her washing today over some grass and the ground has just given way from underneath her feet and she's just slid straight down and she's fallen into a pool of water at the bottom,' Ms Palamberis said.

'She was initially submerged, but she managed to get her head back above water, attempted to climb out of the hole and she remained there because she was just too deep.'

After about half an hour swimming in the sinkhole, she managed to attract the attention of her neighbours who called 000 around 12:10pm. 

'The woman told us she couldn't touch the bottom of the hole, so was trying to swim and stay afloat, to avoid the risk of further mud collapses,' Ms Palamberis said.

A Country Fire Authority spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the woman was removed from the sinkhole within 15 minutes of the 000 call.

'The hole was only half a metre wide (at the top), but actually it opens up very big inside, so there was nothing for her to grab on to get herself to try and get herself out,' Paul Carrigg from the Country Fire Authority told the Herald Sun.

'There was only dirt there, and every time she put her hands up, the dirt disappeared.

 Engineers were brought in to investigate the cause of the sinkhole, which was revealed to be an old poorly concealed well

The 53-year-old woman was not injured 

Engineers were brought in to investigate the cause of the sinkhole, which was revealed to be an old poorly concealed well.

'The well a number of years ago was covered up, but not too satisfactorily and (the cover) degraded over the years to the point where the lady has fallen through,' a council spokeswoman told the Herald Sun.

The 53-year-old woman was not injured.

Ms Palamberis said firefighters did a 'great job' to get the woman out of trouble so quickly.
