A luxury car left in a 30-minute parking space has been there so long nature has started to reclaim it, with grass sprouting from the bonnet of the fully taxed, insured and MoT'd black BMW 320i.

Police and council officials have been unable to trace the owner of the 3 series saloon, abandoned three months ago in Chester.

Cheshire West and Chester Council has now conceded that the car should be classed as 'abandoned' and fixed a notice to it stating that it will be crushed if the owner does not claim it within seven days.

Grass has started growing out of the bonnet of the black BMW 320i after it was abandoned in Chester

The 2004 manual BMW, that would cost around £23,000 to buy brand new, was abandoned beneath the historic City Walls opposite Albion Place in Chester in October 2014.

The mileage of the vehicle is unknown but it is still believed to be worth around £2,000. 

It has become a talking point among neighbours and regulars at the Albion Inn with a number of theories about the mystery car doing the rounds.

At least three parking tickets have been slapped on the car's windscreen over recent months.

The vehicle, parked haphazardly over two bays, is fully taxed, insured and MOT'd

The grass can be seen emerging from under the bonnet of the abandoned vehicle

A council spokesman said: 'We've tried every avenue to contact the owner and it's now classed as abandoned. 

'The problem was it was fully taxed, insured and MoT'd so there was nothing wrong with it. 

'So we had a duty, working with the police, to make every effort to locate the individual before any action could be taken. 

'There was a lot going on behind the scenes. We still do not know what has happened to the owner.'

News of the destruction notice on the four door car - parked haphazardly across two bays - has been welcomed in the area.

Clare Churchill, chef at the Albion Inn, said: 'It's certainly been a talking point among our regulars. There have been plenty of theories about why it was abandoned. It's a bit of an eyesore and we'll be happy to see it go.'

The BMW is set to be crushed in seven days after attempts to trace the owner have drawn a blank

A neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: 'About time. It doesn't give a very good impression of the area, right beneath the Walls for people to see as they walk past. I have no idea why it's taken this long to sort out.'

People have also taken to Twitter to comment on the abandoned car.

Neighbours described the car as an 'eyesore' and said it was 'about time' it was removed
