The terror of a man trapped in a house about to collapse into a flooded river is plan to see, even though he is too far from the camera for his face to be seen.

The dramatic incident is believed to have been filmed in Shifang, Southwest China’s Sichuan Province where the flooding has seen the Shiting River swell over weekend.

The footage shows a lonely man standing on a balcony on a three-story house which has ended up in the middle of the roaring river.

Fear: As he moves across the balcony he appears to try to communicate with the people safely ashore

The flooding in Sichuan triggered a landslide which buried about 30 people in the city of Dujiangyan and trapped hundreds in a nearby highway tunnel.

There was no immediate word on the chances of survival for the 30 or so people buried in the landslide in the city, but rescue workers with search dogs rushed to the area, the official Xinhua News Agency said.

The conditions of the hundreds trapped in a highway tunnel between Dujiangyan and Wenchuan are unclear as authorities are unable to make contact with them, state-run China Central Television said.

The landslide and destroyed a high-profile memorial to a devastating 2008 earthquake that left 90,000 people dead or missing in the area.

He can be seen walking back and 
forwards outside the house in an attempt to communicate with people 
ashore, but it is mere seconds before the river overpowers the 
structure. 

In front of his shocked neighbours, the house is swallowed by the water and collapses into the river.

Powerless to do anything to help, the 
people ashore are forced to watch the poor man disappear into the river 
as the house crumbles.

Torrential rain started to fall in 
Shifang County of Deyang on Monday evening, damaging factory buildings 
and residential houses, and trapping hundreds of people.

As he holds on the the window ledge, the second floor collapses underneath his feet as the power of the river becomes too strong for the isolated house

No escape: The house collapses below the man's feet and his neighbours are powerless

Destruction: The house is engulfed by the river and only the bright blue roof can be seen above the roaring wave

According to Shifang Meteorological 
Department, continues rain has swelled the flow of the Shiting River to 
2,710 cubic meters per second, a historical level.

In another part of Shifang, a phosphate factory had to be rescued when he was stranded by the flowing Shiting River. 

Buildings of a phosphate factory in the city of Deyang, were damaged in the floods.

The worker, stranded outside a damaged building, could find no escape as all paths were inundated and his co-workers had to use sticks to save him.

Cut off: The river is raging behind the man as his co-workers help him to safety after he was stranded among collapsing buildings

Destruction: A building collapses near the factory worker in the city of Deyang

Power of nature: The river shows no mercy as it swallows factory buildings, roads and construction

Cause: Torrential rain started to fall in Shifang on Monday which has led to the flooding of Shiting River

According to local police, the more 
than 200 factory workers and local villagers have been transferred to 
safety with one seriously injured and four missing, as the rescue 
mission continues.

The flooding in Sichuan has affected 
an area that is home to 360,000 people, damaging or destroying 300 
homes, and forcing 6,100 people to evacuate, local news quoted China's 
Civil Affairs Ministry as saying.

'The water is rather torrential and 
has submerged the railway after inundating the highway. The water is so 
high that vehicles, forklifts and excavators have all been washed away,'
said Wei Xiao, a factory worker.

Risky journey: A train runs across the Mianyuan River Bridge of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway Sichuan as the Shiting river rages underneath

Close call: Some land slides have had severely damaging effects, such as this where a huge stone is seen on the Duwen Expressway
