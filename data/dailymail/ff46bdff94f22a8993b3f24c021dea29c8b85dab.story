A mother has been charged with murder after her two toddlers died in a car in sweltering August heat in Tennessee.

Police say Samantha Harper, 25, left Savannah Marise, aged two, and her three-year-old brother Daniel Marise in the car parked outside her home in Smyrna, while she went inside the house and fell asleep.

When she awoke three hours later, she found the two children dead inside the car, police said.

Mother: Samantha Harper is alleged to have left her children in a car for up to three hours on an August day in Tennessee

Harper has now been indicted on two counts of murder and two counts of aggravated child neglect following the toddlers' deaths on August 2 last year, according to The Tennessean.

At the time of the tragedy police said soaring temperatures in Smyrna on the day were in the mid-nineties, and that the temperature inside the vehicle could easily have topped 100 degrees fahrenheit.

'You put someone in a car with the windows rolled up, with no ventilation, it can increase the temperature easy 30 to 40 degrees inside the vehicle,' Smyrna police spokesman Sgt. Bobby Gibson said last August.

Tragedy: Daniel Marise, seen left as a newborn, and his sister Savannah, seen right as a baby, died in the car

Harper's attorney said at her first court appearance that the deaths of her two children were a 'tragic accident'.

One the day of the children's deaths Harper's house was condemned by health officials after police officers found it in a 'deplorable' state.
