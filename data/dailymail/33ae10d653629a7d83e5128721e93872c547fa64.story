The step great-grandfather of a Buffalo Bills player went on a mass shooting spree in Union County, Florida Saturday killing two and injuring another two before committing suicide.

According to Union County Sheriff Jerry Whitehead, Hubert Allen, Jr walked into Prichett Trucking, his former workplace, early Saturday morning and shot David Griffis.

Griffis was taken to UFHealth in Gainesville where he is currently in critical condition.

Mass shooting: Hubert Allen, Jr first went to Pritchett Trucking where he shot David Griffis, before moving on to the owner's farm where he proceeded to shoot three more people

After leaving Pritchett trucking, Griffis went to owner Marvin Pritchett's farm Rolling Oaks.

He shot and skilled farmhand Rolando Gonazalez and Pritchett.

Lewis Mabrey, Jr was also shot and is in critical condition at UFHealth. 

Marvin Pritchett started Pritchett trucking in 1980 after buying a timber business in 1970 that came with three trucks. When the timber business changed in the mid-70s and the industry was put on quotas, he shifted his energies to the trucking business.

Today the company employs well over 400 people and has grown to over 600 trailers, transporting such things as refuse, live floor, dump, flatbed, log, wood by-products, equipment, and contaminated dirt.

Injured: Two men were killed and another two injured. The injured two are in critical condition at UFHealth in Gainesville

Allen then went back to his house where he committed suicide by shooting himself.

Investigators still don't know what the motive of the shooting was.

Allen was the step-grandfather of Buffalo Bills running back CJ Spiller.
