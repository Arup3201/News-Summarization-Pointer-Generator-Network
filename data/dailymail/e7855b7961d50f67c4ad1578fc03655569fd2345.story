Foreign tourists, including Europeans and Americans, were injured when a train derailed on a popular traveling route in Thailand this morning.

French, Australian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and American tourists were among 23 people hurt when seven carriages overturned on old tracks in the mountains north of the country.

Local authorities said one passenger was seriously injured, although it is not clear where they are from.

Twenty-three foreign tourists were injured when seven carriages flipped over on route to Chiang Mai

Australians, Americans and Europeans were among those injured in the crash at Den Chai district of Phrae

The rest suffered minor 
injuries and were given free transport to their destinations.

It was the 
second derailment on the route in a month.

The
 overnight train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, which was carrying 300 passengers, skidded off the tracks and 
seven out of 10 carriages flipped onto their sides, State Railway of 
Thailand governor Prapas Jongsanguan said. 

The accident occurred in 
Phrae province's Den Chai district.

Railway authorities believed the accident was caused by old tracks that were scheduled for repair. 

Railway authorities said the unhurt passengers were free transport to their destinations

Railway authorities said the crash was caused by old track on the route from Bangkok

'From
 an initial investigation, the train was traveling under its limit, but 
the tracks at that stretch were old and in poor condition.

'The last 
carriage, therefore, skidded and brought down other cars,' Prapas told 
The Associated Press.

The
 Bangkok-Chiang Mai train is popular among foreign tourists and a train derailed earlier this month but no one was injured.

Train service heading north on the route was expected to resume later Wednesday after the wreckage was cleared.

300 passengers were on board the sleeper train when it derailed - the second time on that route in a month

At
 least 30 passengers, mostly foreign tourists, were injured when a train

State

train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai skidded off the tracks in Phrae 
province and seven of the 10 carriages flipped on to their sides.

Railway authorities believe the accident was caused by old tracks due for repair.

Mr
 Prapas said one passenger was seriously injured and the rest had minor 
injuries and were given free transport to their destinations.
