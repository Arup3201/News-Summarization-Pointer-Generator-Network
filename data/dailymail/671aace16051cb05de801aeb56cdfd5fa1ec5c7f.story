You couldn't help but see that there was something a little different in Sydney's Hyde Park this morning. 

Workers in the city centre were met with the unusual spectacle of an 18 metre (60 foot high) bright pink condom which appeared over city landmark heritage-listed obelisk. 

The giant sheath is part of a new awareness campaign about HIV by ACON, a health promotion organization with a central focus on HIV/AIDS, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender health. 

The pink condom is being used a campaigning tool against HIV and was lowered onto Sydney's Hyde Park Obelisk on Thursday night

Nicholas Parkhill from the AIDS Council of New South Wales (ACON) said: 'This installation is sure to create lots of interest as we've selected a very visible icon in a high traffic area.' 

Parkhill said while new drugs were able to help in the fight against HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, condoms were still crucial in stopping the spread of the disease, particularly among gay men.

'We need to constantly find new ways to promote this message, especially in the lead up to World AIDS Day on December 1,' he added.

The giant condom is visible from all angles in Sydney's CBD 

The condom has caused quite a stir with the Australian Christian Lobby calling it 'disappointing' 

But Wendy Francis from the Australian Christian Lobby said the stunt was disappointing and "inappropriate for open spaces where children can see it", she told Australian Associated Press.

The number of new HIV cases in Australia is at its highest level in 20 years with 1,235 new cases diagnosed in 2013.

The giant condom, which reads 'Test more + treat early + stay safe = ending HIV, 'will be on the obelisk until Wednesday.
