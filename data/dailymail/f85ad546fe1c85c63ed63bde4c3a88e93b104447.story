Thug: Gareth Williams, 31, was jailed for knocking out a grandfather in front of his family at an Elvis festival in south Wales

A steroid-using thug was jailed today for knocking a grandfather unconscious in front of his family  at an Elvis Presley festival.

Gareth Williams, who has previous convictions for assault, wounding and arson, felled Terrence Niblett, 66, with a single punch at the international event in Porthcawl, South Wales.

Mr Niblett, who has been left deeply traumatised by the assault, had been enjoying a day out with his wife, son and grandchildren.

As the group prepared to watch a performance in a pub, the music fan was saving seats for his son and daughter-in-law when two women asked if they could have them.

When Mr Niblett refused, burly bodybuilder Williams appeared - wearing a T-shirt with the word 'LETHAL' printed on the back - and struck the older man in the face, knocking him unconscious.

Mr Niblett claims he has been crippled by fear and anxiety since the incident - which took place at the Hi Tide pub in Porthcawl.

In a statement read in court, he said: 'I thought I was in a place where I was safe and I have felt frightened and nervous since of anybody I don't know who comes close to me.

'I am an honest man who has never been in trouble and I cannot understand why a person would assault someone for no reason.

'It will affect me for the rest of my life'.

Cardiff Crown Court was told Williams was a steroid user who drinks, takes Class A drugs and has previous convictions for assault, weapon possession, arson, burglary and wounding.  

Describing the shocking incident, prosecutor John Warren said: 'Without warning [Williams] punched Mr Niblett, knocking him off his feet, to the floor.

'The next thing he recalls is coming round and being treated by St John Ambulance staff.

Williams, of Maesteg, south Wales, pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm at Cardiff Crown Court, above, and was sentenced to 34 weeks behind bars

'He was taken to hospital where three stitches were put in the wound on his face'.

Williams, 31, of Maesteg, South Wales, pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm.

Owen Williams, defending, said that Williams regretted his actions after sobering up and claimed his client wants to change.

Judge Philip Richards warned Williams he would 'end up killing someone if he didn't change his ways' - and sentenced him to 34 weeks prison in the prison.

Judge Richards said: 'He has learned nothing from his past offences and if he doesn't stop he will end up killing somebody.
