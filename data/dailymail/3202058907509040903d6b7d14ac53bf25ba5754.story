Christopher Madill, of Phoenix, has been indicted on five counts of sexual exploitation of a minor by a Maricopa County grand jury

A woman was horrified to discover her close friend had allegedly stolen Facebook photos of her nine-year-old daughter and posted them to a child porn site, boasting to pedophiles that he had been abusing her.

Christopher Madill, of Phoenix, has been indicted on five counts of sexual exploitation of a minor by a Maricopa County grand jury. 

Mother Ashley Williams only found out about the alleged crimes committed by her high school friend after she was phoned in January by Homeland Security.

They told her they had been monitoring a Russian child porn website and said the 32-year-old had uploaded 83 innocent pictures of her daughter from Facebook.

'He had told everybody that he was her father and that he got to molest her every single day,' Williams told KTLA.

'And, he was using her pictures to trade with other fathers that are on this website that molest their children. 

'He took the innocence and made it something disgusting.' 

Williams said the news is concerning as her and her friends used to spend time with Madill and they all have children.

'What I want to happen to him, is not really nice,' she said.

'But, I want the justice system. I want him to stay in jail.'

Madill is being held on $100,000 bond at the Lower Buckeye Jail in Phoenix.

Madill is scheduled to be arraigned on February 9. 

She said investigators told the 32-year-old had stolen 83 pictures (pictured) of her daughter from her Facebook
