He has hugged an elephant, rubbed shoulders with celebrities and fulfilled a bizarre dream to go crowd-surfing in a rubber dinghy.

There’s not much Stephen Sutton didn’t get round to on his 46-point ‘bucket list’, right down to having a tattoo and learning to juggle.

But yesterday the cancer-stricken teenager chalked up one achievement he never anticipated when he set himself a series of challenges after he realised he didn’t have long to live.

The Teenage Cancer Trust tweeted 'You Did It' celebrating Stephen's Just Giving page reaching the £1million mark

Joy: Upon hearing the news, Stephen tweeted his thanks - and amazement - to all involved

Stephen's efforts were helped considerably by the comedien and TV presenter Jason Manford, who has  started the Twitter trend #thumbsupforStephen

Mr Sutton's story captured the hearts of the nation when he declared he wanted to tick off a particular part of his bucket list - raising £1m for charity to 'prove there has been some purpose to my short life'

The 19-year-old former schoolboy athlete raised £1million for charity – and saw himself become an internet sensation as he clung to life in a hospital bed.

With a broad smile and ‘a final thumbs-up’ sign posted on his web page diary, he thanked everyone who helped him raise the money and declared: ‘Wow. Just wow.’

Stephen, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer when he was 15, originally hoped to raise £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

It was number one on his ‘to do’ list, which included organising a charity skydive, quizzes, a football match, and playing the drums in front of a huge crowd.

But his plight so captured the hearts of those who followed his Facebook, Twitter and internet updates, he all but abandoned the list after crossing off 33 challenges – and used the growing goodwill to keep fundraising.

Number 42 was ‘to inspire someone to become a doctor or fundraiser’. ‘Done’ he wrote next to it on his blog, adding: ‘The main thing I want to do is help others.’

The comedian and TV presenter Jason Manford has pledged to help Stephen raise the money. Stephen tweeted that he is 'hanging in here as best I can'

Stephen (pictured with comedian Jimmy Carr) has been battling cancer since the age of 15. Within six months he underwent a hemicolectomy to remove a tumour from his bowel

Stephen, from Burntwood, 
Staffordshire, was healthy and active before he was stricken with 
colorectal cancer, competing at county level in athletics and 
cross-country running, and playing for Walsall FC’s youth team. His 
burning ambition was to become a doctor.

He had a tumour removed but the cancer returned and spread.

Told
 that he was unlikely to survive for more than a few years, in January 
last year he started his internet diary, supported by his mother Jane, 
49, brother Christopher, 21, and stepfather Tony.

He
 gave motivational talks on his illness and recruited the likes of Piers
 Morgan, Clare Balding, Robbie Fowler, Alan Davies and Jimmy Carr to his
 cause. 

Plight: Last summer, Mr Sutton gave a speech at Downing Street about his illness

Despite the 'dire' state of his health, Stephen took to Twitter to express his appreciation for the donations

In a tongue-in-cheek swipe at his illness to complete number 23 on his list he had a pair of scissors tattooed on the operational scars that run along his body

He increased the fundraising target when it became clear how much interest he was generating.

He wanted ‘to prove there has been some purpose to my short life’.

Yesterday
 a £10 donation from a well-wisher called Jilly tipped the fund over the
 £1million mark with the message: ‘Looks like your wish will come true.’

But Stephen warned his condition was ‘dire’, telling his followers: ‘I think this is just one hurdle too far.’

As donations continued to pour in at around £50 a minute, he declared: ‘That’s it from me’, and thanked everyone.

He added two words of advice: ‘Enjoy life.’

Bowel cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is the third most common cancer in the UK, and also one of the most preventable forms of the disease, World Cancer Research Fund says.

In 2011, 42,747 cases of bowel cancer were diagnosed. Scientists estimate that about half of all bowel cancer cases in the UK - over 20,000 - could be prevented by maintaining a healthy weight, choosing a healthy diet, not drinking alcohol and being physically active.

Many different factors contribute to the development of bowel cancer, with some of the most important factors being every day lifestyle choices such as diet.

The WCRF found that lifestyle factors that can increase the risk of developing bowel cancer include being: overweight or obese, lack of physical activity, diets low in fibre, diets high in red and processed meat, drinking alcohol, smoking.

Other factors include age, family history of bowel cancer, or personal history of polyps or inflammatory bowel disease.

Last January the fun loving teenager drew up his bucket list of 46 tasks to complete before he dies - including taking part in a skydive

Stephen organised a World Record Attempt for the World's longest continuous group drum roll
