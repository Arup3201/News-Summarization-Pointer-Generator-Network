Police say the shooting occurred at the mail giant's facility in Inglenook, an industrial area near Birmingham airport, about 9.30am, and that both of the male victims were supervisors.

According to WIAT.com,the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office have identified the shooter as 45-year-old Joe Tesney.

The married man, who has two young daughters, was wearing his UPS uniform at the time of the attack, police said.

He then turned the gun on himself.

Shooting rampage: Police stormed a UPS warehouse in Birmingham, Alabama, on Tuesday after a gunman shot dead two workers before killing himself

The UPS warehouse was closed off after a UPS employee opened fire Tuesday morning inside one of the facility in Alabama, killing two people before taking his own life

Tesney had reportedly been served his final papers on Monday and was not expected to return to work, police said.

Tensey shot dead two of his managers.

The killer was a member of the North Park Baptist Church along with his wife and two children according to pastor Bill Wilks.

Wilks described Tesney as being 'troubled' over his work and financial situation.

'I think it's been an ongoing situation. In his own spirit he's been troubled, and he's asked for prayer about that.'

Tesney
 and his wife, Melissa, are listed as distributors for Advocare, a 
multi-level marketing company that sells health and fitness products. 
They have a website advertising the business that says: 'Just tell us 
your needs, your dreams your desires ... and we'll make it happen!'

Police said Tesney had gotten that final notice in the mail.

Court
 records showed a Birmingham business sued Tesney and UPS in 2010 
claiming he had wrongly picked up a $4,000 radiator for shipment either 
intentionally or by mistake. The lawsuit went on for years before a 
judge ruled in favor of Tesney and the shipping company exactly one year
 ago - Sept. 23, 2013.

However, it was not immediately clear why Tesney had been fired or whether that lawsuit may have played a role.

The
 UPS warehouse, a light brown building sitting on a hill with company 
logos on the front and side, is used to sort packages and send them out 
on trucks. About 80 drivers had already left on their routes, and a 
small number remained when the shooter drove up in a private vehicle 
Tuesday morning and walked inside through a truck dock door in the back 
of the building.

The building has a parking lot surrounded by barbed wire.

The
 man was wearing a UPS uniform and opened fire either in or near some 
offices inside the warehouse in an industrial area just north of the 
Birmingham airport, Birmingham Police Chief A.C. Roper told reporters.

The gunman had apparently shot himself by the time officers got inside the warehouse, Roper said. No one else was hurt.

Employees
 who were at the warehouse when the shooting happened were taken to 
another location so that they could be interviewed by investigators and 
provided with counseling, Roper said.

The shooter reportedly targeted offices inside the warehouse.

Police arrived at the scene following numerous calls for help, with employees said to have fled the facility in fear.

When authorities arrived, the gunman and the two victims were already dead.

'We'll be digging into the work history, into the background, also talking to family members and these other employees who may be able to shed some information on what happened today,' Birmingham Police Chief A.C. Roper told AL.com.

'We have a pretty good idea about what transpired inside the business.

'We want to make sure we get a good picture of what led up to today and what we can do in the future to prevent it.'

According to AL.com, Tesney's family are in shock over what has transpired.

'He was one of the best men I have ever known,' his mother-in-law, Wanda Binney, told the website.

'He was a kind husband and a wonderful father.

'He never hurt anyone in his life.'

Tesney was reportedly fired a month ago and tried to appeal the decision.

However he lost.

Court documents obtained by AL.com show he was the subject on a 2012 lawsuit, with a business claiming Tesney removed a $4000 radiator while picking up a package.

The radiator was never returned, however a judge found in favor of Tesney and UPS in September last year.

No other people were injured.

Police did not fire any shots.

'It is extremely troubling for the city, for the families involved,' Roper added.

'When they came to work today they had no idea it would be their last day alive on earth.
