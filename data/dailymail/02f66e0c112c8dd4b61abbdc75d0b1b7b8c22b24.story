A device that can diagnose attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and teenagers has been approved for use

A device that can diagnose attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and teenagers has been approved for use.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now allowing marketing of the device which measures brain function to help assess whether a child has the condition.

It is designed to be used to confirm a doctor’s diagnosis, or to make up part of a complete examination which would also include psychological tests.

The Neuropsychiatric EEG-Based Assessment Aid (NEBA) System records different electrical impulses given off by nerve cells in the brain, and the number of times the impulses are given off each second.

During a 15 minute non-invasive test it calculates the ratio of two standard brain waves – theta and beta waves.

The theta/beta ratio has been shown to be higher in children and adolescents with ADHD than in children without it.

‘Diagnosing ADHD is a multi-step process based on a complete medical and psychiatric exam,’ said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA’s Centre for Devices and Radiological Health.

‘The NEBA System, along with other clinical information, may help healthcare providers more accurately determine if ADHD is the cause of a behavioural problem.’

To test the device, a clinical study was carried out that evaluated 275 children and adolescents ranging from six to 17-years-old with attention or behavioural issues.

Clinicians evaluated all 275 patients using the NEBA System and using standard diagnostic techniques, including behavioural questionnaires, IQ testing, and physical examinations to determine if the patient had ADHD.

An independent group of ADHD experts reviewed the data and decided on a diagnosis.

The study results showed that the use of the NEBA System helped doctors make a more accurate diagnosis of ADHD when it was used in conjunction with a clinical assessment for ADHD, compared with doing the clinical assessment alone.

However, not all experts have welcomed the device.

Some doctors believe that clinical examinations are sufficient to diagnose ADHD and claim that using this device would just increase the cost of diagnosis.

ADHD is one of the most common behavioural disorders in childhood.

Children with ADHD have difficulty with attention, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and behavioural problems.
