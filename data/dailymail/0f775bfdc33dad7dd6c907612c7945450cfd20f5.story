It took 33 years but a California man's beloved finally came back to him.

A blue 1964 Thunderbird stolen from Gary Chartrand in 1981 was found by police officers far from Chartrand's Sacramento home.

'I donâ€™t even remember how to get into the glove box,' Chartrand told KOVR as he sat in the front seat of his T-Bird for the first time in decades.

Lovestruck: Gary Chartrand reacts with surprise after seeing his baby blue Thunderbird roll back into his life after 33 years

He had bought the car for $1,600 to cheer himself up after a divorce ended his 10-year marriage.

A year later, the car was gone too. That night in 1981, Chartrand was bartending at Fanny Ann's Saloon, a bar in Old Sacramento.

Police found the stolen car 750 miles north in Washington. Whoever had taken an interest in the classic car had kept it in 'beautiful' condition.

'Just a few bumps and bruises,' said Chartrand. 'Boy, not much has changed.'

Based on the state of what's under the hood, Chartrand thinks whoever had it last 'was getting it registered or ready for the road.'

Now that the baby blue hardtop is back in Chartrand's care, the next question will be where it was all these years.

KOVR reports that police are still searching for the original police report that Chartrand filed when the car was first stolen.
