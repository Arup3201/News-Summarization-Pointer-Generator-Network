Five students at New Jersey's William Paterson University pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges they restrained and sexually assaulted a female student in a dorm.

The five are charged with crimes including conspiracy, criminal restraint and aggravated sexual assault. The alleged attack occurred November 25 on the campus in Wayne.

Jahmel Latimer of Hoboken, Darius Singleton of Jersey City, Garret Collick of Paterson, Noah Williams of Camden and Tremaine Scott of Vineland pleaded not guilty through their attorneys at a brief proceeding Tuesday. Scott was delayed until his attorney arrived.

Bail was lowered from $200,000 to $50,000 by the Passaic County prosecutor's office. The five were being held at the county jail and appeared in court in prison uniforms. 

The female student reported last week that she was attacked in a dorm room at William Paterson University and then held against her will.

According to the criminal complaint, the five men turned out the lights and used 'physical force or coercion' to attack the victim at the Overlook South residence hall.

They then forced her to perform multiple sex acts before they stopped her from leaving the room. 

Court documents show that the five men arrested were Noah Williams, Garrett Collick , Termaine Scott, Jahmel Latimer and Darius Singleton, who all studied at the University.

The men, who are all 18, are facing a range of charges from kidnapping to aggravated criminal sexual contact, and bail has been set at $200,000 for each suspect.

According to the Record, which obtained the complaint to police, Latimer is accused of pulling the woman by the hair and forcing her to perform sex acts.

The other four men are alleged to have conspired to commit sexual assault, restrained another person unlawfully and exposed them to risk of serious bodily injury.

The school's president Kathleen Waldron confirmed that all five of the accused lived at the university and have been 'barred from campus'.

In a statement she added: 'My deepest concern is for the victim of this criminal act who has courageously stepped forward to take legal action and seek justice.

Locals: The university in Wayne, New Jersey has a student population of around 11,500. The suspects come from the nearby cities of Jersey City, Camden, Paterson and Vineland

'No expression of anger or sadness on my part can alleviate the harm done to the victim and my heart goes out to her and her family.'

The case comes just weeks after an article in Rolling Stone magazine described an alleged gang rape on campus at a fraternity house at the University of Virginia.

The article detailed the alleged sexual assault of a freshman woman by seven men at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 2012.

The university, in Charlottesville, has suspended all activities of its fraternities, sororities and related groups until January 9 to address sexual violence and assault.

Police are investigating and Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said he would be appointing an independent counsel to review the school's sexual violence policies.
