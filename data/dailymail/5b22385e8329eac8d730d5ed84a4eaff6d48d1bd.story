Getting married: Gary Hersham, 60, will be giving away his actress daughter Gabriela, pictured, as planned this weekend

As the founder of one of London’s most exclusive estate agents, regularly selling homes worth in excess of £20 million, burly Gary Hersham has always been a force to be reckoned with in the property market.

But despite being fit and a keen tennis player, 6ft Gary was no match for the four thugs who followed him by car as he drove his Mercedes near Marble Arch at the weekend - and then subjected him to a vicious attack the moment he had parked.

Three of the men launched themselves at him as he clambered out of his car - he was on his way to meet a friend - grabbing him from behind, punching and throttling him and covering his eyes.

They relieved him of his watch and his keys. The fourth remained at the wheel of their getaway car.

‘It was an expensive watch, and of sentimental value. I will be wearing an Accurist from now on,’ says Gary, 60, who will be giving away his actress daughter Gabriela, pictured, as planned this weekend.

Typically, the businessman was bloodied but unbowed. Hersham refused hospital treatment despite being left shaken by the incident and suffering a bruised larynx. He was back at work 48 hours later.

‘They must have been following me,’ he tells me. ‘I parked and they stopped their car in the middle of the road. A porter at a block of flats nearby saw what happened and managed to get their number plate, but the police haven’t traced them.’

Urbane Gary, a friend of Ukrainian billionaire Gennadiy Bogolyubov, started his Beauchamp Estates company in Mayfair 35 years ago - he is currently marketing a luxurious ten-bedroom mansion in St John’s Wood for £25 million.

And he is refusing to let the mugging affect his plans for his daughter’s wedding. Beautiful Gabriela, 25 - Gary’s child by his first wife, Ada - is marrying her boyfriend of the past two years, French-born hedge fund entrepreneur Antoine Nussenbaum.

In a bizarre coincidence, Gabriela’s acting career has often involved her playing roles almost as scary as that of her father’s real-life incident.

She is co-starring as a werewolf in the forthcoming horror flick Crying Wolf and has also been filming a pilot for a  U.S. TV series in which she plays a femme fatale thief.

Just weeks after I revealed that Tory MP Tracey Crouch had split from her Lib Dem DJ boyfriend Steve Ladner, I gather she is not short of offers from other men.

She was in a bar over the weekend - alone, alas, and reading a book - when she was approached by what she describes as a ‘drunk guy harassing me’.

She tweeted friends asking whether she should deflect him by pretending to be a lesbian, swearing or leaving.

Her colleague, Police Minister Damian Green, advised her to simply tell the truth. ‘Tell him you’re an MP,’ he suggested.

It did the trick, but all the more reason for Ms Crouch to find herself a new chap, perhaps.

Back to school: Mother-of-four Sian Williams already has a qualification in trauma counselling

Elfin broadcaster Sian Williams made the news herself when she refused to join the BBC exodus to Salford and left the Breakfast programme’s sofa.

Now she is raising eyebrows again with a decision to combine her career with reading for a masters degree in psychology at the University of Westminster.

The mother-of-four, 48, who turned down Strictly Come Dancing after consulting her children, already has a qualification in trauma counselling.

She became interested in the area after reporting on the Asian tsunami in 2004 and the Pakistan earthquake in 2008.

‘Sian hasn’t done any exams for nearly 30 years, but her sons have been helping out with revision tips,’ says a friend.

Sian is leaving Radio 4’s Saturday Live show to concentrate on her studies.

‘This is an exciting new chapter for Sian. She will be spreading her wings and taking on a number of new TV projects in the next year,’ adds the friend. 

In the world of celebrity crimper Nicky Clarke, there is no such thing as a bad hair day - fixing the follicles of stars and the super-rich is what he charges £500 a snip for.

But Mayfair stylist Nicky, whose clients have included Liz Hurley and Cate Blanchett, is experiencing problems with his own lush tresses.

Nicky, 55, who shares his life with fashionista Kelly Simpkin, has bought an Italian scooter to nip between home in St  John’s Wood and the West End.

But he complains that wearing a crash helmet on the five-mile journey flattens down his famously flowing hair, making it lose its ‘bounce’.

Better than losing your bonce, Nicky.

Plan: JCB diggers tycoon Sir Anthony Bamford's wife Carole Bamford is about to open a restaurant near their Gloucestershire home

Newly elevated to the House of Lords, Tory donor and wildly rich JCB diggers tycoon Sir Anthony Bamford will be able to celebrate his investiture in style — at the restaurant his wife is about to open  near their Gloucestershire home.

Carole Bamford has spent more than a year overseeing the renovation of the former Tollgate pub in nearby Kingham, hanging its name to The Wild Rabbit.

Although she is not the licensee, Lady Bamford has ensured some uniquely personal touches — much of the produce will come from her Daylesford estate and for five years the chef Adam Caisley was her family’s private cook.

Caisley previously worked for Michel Roux Jr at the Michelin-starred Le Gavroche and friends say Lady Bamford hopes he might be able to win her a star, too.

The hostelry opens next week and will no doubt attract custom from the so-called Chipping Norton set, which includes David Cameron, Jeremy Clarkson and troubled ex-newspaper boss Rebekah Brooks.

It is an intriguing development for Lady Bamford. Her Daylesford Organic brand has endured challenging trading conditions.

Latest figures from Companies House show the business made a £4.3 million loss at the end of 2011, and the Bamfords state in the accounts that ‘they will provide financial support to enable the company to continue as a going concern’.

Chanteuse Cheryl Cole may have endured 15 painful hours having giant roses tattooed on her bottom, but she is not the only one for a penchant for covering her body with artwork.

A fan of classical singing group Blake has had her entire torso and both arms inked with the band’s lyrics, along with intricate pictures illustrating each tune.

‘A mother and daughter from Dorset came to one of our gigs a couple of weeks ago and the daughter proudly showed us these tattoos,’ says tenor and former Winchester Cathedral chorister Ollie Baines, 30.

‘They were multi-coloured and all over her upper body, back and arms and she’s considering having our faces done next apparently. It was quite a surprise.

‘The lengths that some fans go to is really rather extraordinary.’

P.S. Proof, surely, that talk of Prince Andrew and Fergie remarrying is just that: Madame Tussauds has no plans to bring their waxworks back.

The couple were removed from the attraction years ago. Not that the Yorks have completely vanished.

‘We store in our archives all the moulds, heads and hands of every figure we’ve ever made,’ says head of marketing Nimali Weerasinghe.

‘We have re-cast and updated figures in the past - to date we’ve created 23 figures of the Queen. At this moment, we don’t have plans to create new figures of the Duke and Duchess of York.’
