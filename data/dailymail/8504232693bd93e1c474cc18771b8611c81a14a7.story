Seven years ago, Nathan Bracken was the world’s number one bowler in one day international cricket and was on his way to becoming a cricket legend.

Today, he has a permanent disability, cannot straighten his right leg and can barely carry his baby son for fear that it will buckle under him.

He and his family say they face financial ruin because of the tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills they face after an injury he suffered playing for Australia.

His wife, Haley Bracken has spoken to Daily Mail Australia about her family's struggles as they continue to fight Cricket Australia during an exhausting five year legal battle.

‘Nathan has suffered severe depression. There have been times that he’s been balled up on the couch crying, so stressed,' Haley Bracken told Daily Mail Australia.

‘He’d say to me “What am I going to do? I can’t support our family”. 

'We haven't spoken out for sympathy but the truth is, I have experienced anxiety attacks and we worry about our future everyday. 

'This situation has impacted on the family in a very negative way,’ said Haley, a model, dancer, presenter and mother.

When Nathan's career ended instantaneously, he was left with no other job prospects and no income. 

He had never finished his degree, a Bachelor of Communications, due to his international travel commitments with cricket and had anticipated he had years of cricket ahead of him. 

A role was made for Nathan in his father-in-law's recruitment company.

The couple, parents of two young boys, have already sold a property and two cars to make ends meet and fear that their little family could have to sell their home. 

‘My parents have already offered that we can all move in there if we need to,' Haley said. 

'We already sold the land where we’d planned on building our dream property and had a garage sale to get rid of belongings. We have to drive past that property every day on the school run.’ 

The couple allege that Nathan approached Cricket Australia one year after his career-ending knee injury to enquire about what policies were in place to assist with his medical costs.

CA officials allegedly refused to help him.

‘That’s when we knew it was going to be very difficult,’ said Haley.

Their lives changed immediately, descending from the glory of first class cricket to no source of income. 

Nathan had no other job opportunities and an endless pile of medical and legal bills, which continue today.

‘The letters keep on coming. Every time I look at a new lawyer’s letter I feel sick because I know it’s just another massive bill. I just have to try and think about it all one day at a time,' said Haley.

Nathan Bracken first launched his lawsuit in 2011 against Cricket Australia, seeking compensation for lost wages, medical expenses and damages.

He had been forced to retire that year at the age of 31. 

Although it is not the easy option, Haley says she knows it was the right decision to take a stand.

'I want people to see that if we can stand up for our rights, they can too. To question those in authority and question what happens in big corporations.' 

It hurts Haley to see the impact it has on her husband who found so much happiness playing cricket.

'What breaks my heart the most is that Nathan gave his heart and soul to cricket,' she said.

'He was away a lot and there was a lot of sacrifice. For them to turn around and wipe their hands of him breaks my heart'

The couple try to stay strong as they are incredibly concerned for their two young sons; Chase, seven and Tag, one.

‘My eldest son is the sweetest, most sensitive soul. It does make this process hard because he is so sensitive,’ she told Daily Mail Australia.

‘This has unavoidably had a huge impact on my family.

‘We try to keep him out of it. But Chase said to us, “I don’t want to play cricket”...’

He told us, “Dad, you hurt your knee playing cricket, I don’t want to do that.” This whole thing has skewed his view, he’s just a kid.’

Haley says she and her family have become stronger through the process, 

Her husband has battled debilitating injuries after his incredible cricket career and has been left with a permanent disability.

Haley says the impact of those injuries has been immense, to the point that her husband would not carry their baby down stairs, terrified his injured knee would buckle.

Nathan is unable to straighten his knee so he cannot do an exercise as simple as kicking a football in the backyard with their two little boys.

‘Nathan had an ankle operation on the other leg (not the knee which currently needs surgery) and he collapsed on the floor.

‘He just couldn’t get up. I tried to help him up but there’s quite a height distance between us so I couldn’t.

‘So I just sat on the floor and cried with him, thinking: “this is our future”. I don’t want that to happen, where I can’t lift him or help him in any way.’

Haley is grateful for her resilient family and relieved that they will soon have certainty about their future.

‘We know that no matter what we’re going through, we’ve got our family.

‘I say to Nathan that even if we’re living in a cardboard box we’ll always have each other.’  

Nathan and Haley also allege that Cricket Australia are not fulfilling their responsibilities as an employer, neglecting him once he was injured.

They are concerned that Medicare and private health insurance have been allegedly paying for cricketer's injuries, accusing Cricket Australia of not having adequate insurance schemes.

'Those resources are being taken away from people who have no other option,' Haley claimed.

'It’s important to stand up for your own rights but it’s particularly important to stand up for other’s rights as well.' 

Cricket Australia were contacted by Daily Mail Australia but said they could not comment on legal grounds. The case is set down for hearing in the Supreme Court in October.

‘I just want to be free from the situation, for us as a family to be free from it and to be able to move on and close that chapter.’ 

'All of this - it's just not cricket.'
