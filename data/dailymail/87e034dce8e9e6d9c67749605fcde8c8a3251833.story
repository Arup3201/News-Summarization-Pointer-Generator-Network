Residents of a New York City neighborhood spooked by recent sightings of an unidentified creature can rest easy.

Locals in the Morris Heights area of the Bronx have been seeing the creature scurrying about the area for months, generally by night but sometimes in broad daylight.

Some thought it was a skunk, others a raccoon, but now it's finally been identified: the unusual-looking animal is a fisher, sometimes called a fisher-cat, and it could be the answer the New York City's rat problem.

Mysterious: This creature was photographed around the Bronx for months before it was identifed

The Department of Environmental Conservation describes the fisher as a 'large, dark, long-haired member of the weasel family. Their stature is relatively low to the ground, with short legs, small ears and a well-furred tail.'

'One night, I was out putting out garbage and I saw it running across, and I was like, "Wow what is that?"' Patrick Watson told CBS New York.

The first sighting was in April when NYPD officer Derek Lenart managed to take a picture of the animal.

After that, others documented its meanderings around the area, but no one knew what it was until now.

Zoologist Roland Kays identified it as a fisher after being sent a picture of the creature.

The fisher
 is a member of the weasel family that once lived in the New York City 
area in abundance until the fur trade pushed them north and into the 
Adirondacks.

Kays, of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, tells CBS that the creature may have come down the river.

No natural predators: Fishers are hunters that prey on small rodents - but aren't a threat to humans

Rat catcher: Zoologists say it is a fisher, a rat-eating member of the weasel family that was driven from the New York area in the 1600s after it was over-hunted for its fur

Re-establishing: It's unclear if the fisher is making a comeback or if the Bronx creature is the only one of its kind

'I'm guessing maybe he came down the river, kind of connecting up some of the natural areas, and then kind of took this side trip off into the Bronx. They're very good at sneaking around,' he told CBS.

New Yorkers should be thrilled.

Turns out the fisher preys on rats and squirrels. It's not a threat to humans but could be to cats and small dogs.

They can climb trees and have even been known to prey on deer.

Fisher trapping was banned in the 1930s. Kays says today the fisher population is booming in the Northeast and a trapping season has been reinstated.

Kays said the last sighting of a fisher in the New York City area was probably in the 1600s.

If the Bronx fisher is a sign of the species re-establishing itself in the city, it will face a host of challenges, such as avoiding being hit by cars.

'We’ve never seen them survive in anything as developed as the Bronx, so we don’t know,' Kays told DNA Info. 'Can they really set up a population?'
