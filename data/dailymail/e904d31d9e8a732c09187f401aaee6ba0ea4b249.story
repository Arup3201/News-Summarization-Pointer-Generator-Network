Luis Suarez is understood to be taking advice from a Spanish lawyer with strong links to Barcelona to help him in his appeal against his four-month ban for biting.

Juan de Dios Crespo is working with Suarez and the Uruguayan FA with the ongoing appeal to FIFA against the punishment, which also includes a nine-match international ban, after Suarez’s initial legal pleas, which included a denial that the bite took place, proved disastrous and only antagonised FIFA’s disciplinary commission.

Barcelona are believed to have insisted that Suarez make a public apology if he wants to move to the Catalan club from Liverpool this summer – and the player obliged yesterday, admitting his guilt for the first time and apologising to Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini.

Now De Dios Crespo, the same lawyer Barcelona have used to help them fight their transfer ban that was imposed by FIFA after they were found guilty of infringing regulations in signing youth-team players from abroad, is also working on the case.

The respected Spanish lawyer is an expert on sports law and on FIFA’s procedures and his engagement and Suarez’s public apology indicates that the line of defence is likely to change from the ham-fisted attempt by the Uruguayan Federation to divert blame for the incident.

Suarez’s defence is now likely to include an admission that he bit Chiellini, a display of contrition and a plea for mitigation. As such, it is likely that he will face a reduced ban and could be playing for Barcelona early next season, if his move from Liverpool is completed.

In his initial submission to the FIFA Disciplinary Commission, Suarez was quoted as saying: ‘In the run-up to the impact, my knees came together, I lost my balance and that destabilised my body and I fell into my opponent.

'In that moment, my face came into collision with the player, causing a small bruise on my cheekbone and a lot of pain to my teeth, which caused the referee to stop play. That is what happened and in no event did I, as is written in the document, ‘bite’ or ‘try to bite.’

However, the attempt to deny the incident appears to have been an enormous misjudgement by Suarez and his legal team and resulted in a more severe sanction than might have been expected had any contrition been shown, as the FIFA Disciplinary Commission noted ‘that at no point did the player show any contrition or repentance of any type, nor did he admit any violation of FIFA regulations and has therefore not shown any knowledge of having committed any offence.’
