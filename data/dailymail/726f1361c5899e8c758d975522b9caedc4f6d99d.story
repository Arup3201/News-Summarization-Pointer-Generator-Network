Two Australian men think they may be in possession of the world's oldest burger, after they kept a Quarter Pounder with cheese bought for a friend who never turned up to eat it.

When  Eduard Neetz and Casey Dean were 13 an 14 respectively, they took a trip to their local McDonald's restaurant in Adelaide to grab some food after a party.

The men picked up an extra for their mate Jono who never showed. That was 20 years ago.

Jono told the boys to hold on to his meal until next time he came to visit as a joke, and 'he hasn't been back yet', the men told The Project.

Two decades later it has no mould on it whatsoever

Eduard and Casey have kept the burger under lock and key for the past two decades, and though it looks as though it was picked up at a Maccas just moments ago, the Quarter Pounder is 'rock hard'.

'It's rock hard, absolutely solid as a brick' the friends said while showing off their prized possession.

After all that time kept behind closed doors, Casey told the program it was time to 'free the burger' and boys have released a song on iTunes dedicated to their 'Senior Burger'.

'As opposed to a Junior Burger', Casey joked.

The pair horrified The Project hosts when they pretended to eat the burger

They have now released a song in honour of 'Senior Burger' with all proceeds going to Beyond Blue

All proceeds raised from sales of their song go directly to BeyondBlue and Carry Bickmore soon asked the pair how much she would have to donate for them to sample the burger. 

Despite all The Project hosts trying to get Eduard and Casey to take a bite out of the age-old snack and the men playing along, quite quickly they flat out refused.

'No way you guys are sick!' Casey laughed. 'It's a 20-year-old burger we're not eating it, no way.'

The men have set up a website, Twitter account and Facebook page for Senior Burger, where fans can purchase merchandise and listen to their serenade to the Quarter Pounder.
