A young girl who was diagnosed with kidney cancer after she fell off her bike on holiday, has celebrated overcoming the illness by flying like Peter Pan.

Five year old Nikkita Mills, was enjoying a family holiday in France in August 2011 when she took a tumble. She was rushed to hospital after she developed internal bleeding.

But
the accident turned out to be a blessing in disguise, when doctors treating her discovered she had a Wilms' tumour.

Nikkita (pictured before treatment left), underwent a year of gruelling treatment for kidney cancer. She enjoyed a day at the pantomime (pictured right) where she met the cast and had a go at flying on a wire

Her father Adrian, 44, from Canterbury, said: 'That accident quite probably saved her life.

'Who knows how long it 
would have been before we started noticing any signs she was unwell with
the tumour if it wasn't for that accident?'

As soon as she arrived back in the 
UK she started chemotherapy treatment at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London to shrink the tumour before having
surgery to remove it, along with her right kidney.

She then started a 
four week course of radiotherapy and a 36 week course of chemotherapy. 
During Nikkita's treatment she needed blood transfusions and platelet 
therapy.

She struggled with numerous infections and contracted E. Coli, which 
resulted in her being hospitalised for a month.

A form of kidney cancer that affects around 70 children in the UK each year. It most often develops in youngsters below the age of five.

Wilms' tumours, also known as nephroblastomas, begins to develop when a baby is still growing inside their mother.

However, it may not cause any symptoms until a few years after the child is born.

Wilms' tumours usually only affect one kidney (unilateral) but in about seven out of every 100 children it can affect both (bilateral).

Most Wilms' tumours are quite large when they are found - very often much bigger than the kidney itself. Fortunately, most of them have not spread toÂ  other parts of the body.

The most common symptom is a swelling in the abdomen, which is usually painless.

Occasionally, the tumour may bleed slightly and this can cause irritation in the area of the kidney, which may be painful.

Children with the condition may have blood in their urine, or their blood pressure may be raised.

The child may also have a fever, upset stomach, weight loss or a lack of appetite.

However, the brave girl finished 
treatment in September 2012 and last month her family received the fantastic news that she was in remission.

She will continue to have regular check-ups but for now the gruelling rounds of treatment are over.

Nikkita was able to celebrate the good news by flying like Peter Pan, thanks to a wish-granting charity.

Last week she met the cast at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley led by actress Jennifer Ellison, before having a go on a practice swing.

She then met Tinkerbell, played by CBBC presenter Gemma Hunt, who gave Nikkita her very own costume to fly in.

Nikkita then took to the skies with Wendy and Peter Pan whilst the rest of the cast from the pantomime production of Peter Pan filled the stage to sing.

She rounded off her fabulous day by watching the matinee performance of the show along with her mother Caterina, father Adrian and seven-year-old brother Minali.

Mr Mills said the cast 'were all wonderfully attentive and made Nikkita feel very special. Thank you for giving Nikkita a memory that will shine above the memories of her long treatment.'

Nikkita's day out was organised by the Make-A-Wish foundation.
