A lesbian couple have spoken of their fury after a security guard at a cinema ordered them to leave the ladies' toilets because he thought they were men.

Tracey Seaton and Keira Williams had just watched a film at a branch of Cineworld when they popped into the loo.

But they were followed in by a male guard, who accused them of being men and kicked them out of the area.

Miss Seaton, 28, and her 27-year-old partner Miss Williams had just watched the new film adaptation of Annie at the cinema in Ilford, east London.

'Just like most people, we went to the toilet after the film,' said Miss Seaton, who works as a lifeguard.

'It seems strange to say, but since we're women we went to the women's bathroom.

'But when we were washing our hands, this horrible guard came in and told us to get out. He said, "Don't you know this is the women's bathroom?"

'I've never been so angry and embarrassed in my entire life. He was adamant we were in the wrong toilet, and kept insisting on it.

'It was shocking treatment - they definitely need to be more gay-friendly. We're never going back.'

Outrage: The couple say they were left 'angry and embarrassed' after the recent incident

The couple, who have been together for seven months, were offered £20 gift vouchers and two free tickets to the cinema as compensation for the way they were treated.

However, they have turned down the offer and are calling on Cineworld to investigate the incident fully to ensure it never happens again.

Miss Williams, a bookmaker, said: 'I just want them to train their staff on how to deal with these situations and on how to treat people appropriately.

'It was quite intimidating, and the guard didn't even bother to apologise. This is the first time either of us have ever experienced anything like it. It's disgusting.'

And Miss Seaton added: 'At the pool where I work, quite often people accidentally walk into the wrong changing room - but you don't have a go at them.

'Most people will correct their mistakes pretty quickly, and it's not for workers to decide the gender of customers based on their appearance.'

A spokesman for Cineworld, which operates more than 800 screens across the UK, said: 'At Cineworld, we treat all customers equally regardless of gender, religion, race or sexuality.

'We have investigated this complaint fully and we have apologised to Tracey and Keira, in addition to offering them a goodwill gesture.

'In this case, our security staff were responding to concerns expressed by other customers. We recognise that this could have been handled more sensitively by our security staff. We have spoken to the staff concerned to ensure that this does not happen again in future.'
