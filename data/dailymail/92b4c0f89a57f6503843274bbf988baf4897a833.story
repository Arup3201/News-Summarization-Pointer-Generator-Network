The Great British Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood has split from his wife of 15 years.

The news comes just weeks after Paul filmed the US version of the hit cookery show alongside a younger, more glamorous version of Mary Berry - 34-year-old Marcela Valladolid.

A statement from Hollywood's agent confirmed the news, reading: 'We confirm that Paul Hollywood has separated from his wife. Their priority is protecting their son. He will be making no further comment on this private matter.'

Have they split? Paul Hollywood and wife Alexandra's rumoured split is thought to have shocked their friends

The statement did not comment on 
reports that Paul's 'close friendship' with Marcela was partly to blame 
for his marriage breakdown.

According to reports, Paul, who is 
known as the George Clooney of baking, has now moved out of the family 
home and was living in a studio flat in Kent, and is only telling friends he has split from wife Alexandra.

Following the news breaking, Paul cancelled a book signing that was scheduled in Glasgow, Scotland, on Saturday.

Paul, who has an 11-year-old son with his
wife, only recently returned from LA where he appeared on the US 
version of the show, The American Baking Competition.

Divorced
mother-of-one Marcela, who is the US version of 78-year-old Mary Berry,
and Paul were said to have 'hit it off from day one' and the Tequila 
brand owner described him as a 'handsome devil.'

And during his time in LA, both Paul and Marcela frequently shared pictures of themselves together on Twitter.

Since they stopped filming the series, the pair's Twitter conversations haven't ended, 
with Marcela telling Paul she was sending him a 'big hug'.

A friend of Paul's told The Sun: 'Marcela loved his Scouse charm and he thought she was gorgeous and talented - the perfect package.

'During filming they got very close and count each other as close friends'.

Friends are said to be astonished Paul
and Alexandra's marriage is over as before the presenter started 
filming in the US he whisked her off on a romantic holiday to Paris.

Paul and Alexandra first met when he was a chef in a top hotel in Cyprus, and Paul said in a recent interview that his wife finds his new sex symbol status 'hilarious'.

He added of the George Clooney 
comparisons: 'It’s flattering. But I always think they are taking the 
mickey. I don’t really believe it.

'It’s
quite embarrassing. I’m quite shy, really. The figure you see on TV, 
that’s just a persona. I like getting home, putting my feet up, getting 
into my slippers and dressing gown.'

Paul continued: 'I get marriage proposals, maybe one a week. Women do flirt, yes. They just want someone from the telly.

'They come and talk to you and I guess baking is more attractive and so they feel they have something in ­common with me.'

Close: Since Paul returned from the US the pair have been tweeting each other - but have remained silent on the nature of their relationship

Paul is now hoping that his involvement in the US show will increase his profile Stateside.

Speaking about the new show to the Daily Mail at the TV Bafta Awards on Sunday, Paul praised 
British contestants for having a ‘stiff upper lip’ and admitted he was 
surprised to discover how thin-skinned their American counterparts were.

He said: ‘It’s exactly the same show. 
Same tent, same set up, same stations, same people. Except they are 
bigger. They are very emotional, and of course I’m not the right person 
to put up with that. Within the first week, all of them were crying.

The George Clooney of baking! The Bake Off has made Paul something of a heartthrob

UK pride: Hollywood, pictured on last year's Great British Bake Off with Mary Berry, said contestants in America lacked the 'stiff upper lip' of the Brits

‘I
said “I’m so sorry, but I’m only saying your cake doesn’t look good.” 
And then they just burst into tears. It’s all a bit much. But in Britain
it’s all stiff upper lip. And then you get crying later.’

He added: ‘To be honest, the bakers 
over here are much better. But we are filming series four now here so 
the fact is things will only get better in America. You are going to 
attract a more qualified baker.'

MailOnline has contacted Paul for a comment on the allegations.
