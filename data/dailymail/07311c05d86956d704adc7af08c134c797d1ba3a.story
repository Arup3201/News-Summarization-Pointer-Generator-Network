Amid the angry chants directed towards the board, another sound could be detected emerging from the Celtic fans who filed dejectedly out of Parkhead on Tuesday evening.

It was the noise of thousands of heads being scratched. A low grumble of disaffected bemusement at precisely what Ronny Deila had been attempting to achieve with elements of his team selection, tactics and substitutions in the dire 1-0 defeat from Maribor. Some are still wondering more than 24 hours on.

It remains far too early in the Norwegian’s tenure for any sweeping judgments about his future prospects in the role. Make no mistake, however, this was a decidedly bad night on a personal level for the affable 38-year-old.

Not happy: Celtic fans protest after their side crashed out of the Champions League on Tuesday

Early exit: Celtic were beaten at home by Maribor after drawing the first leg in Slovenia

A lack of investment from above may have created the loudest outcry but Deila now finds himself under serious scrutiny from supporters dismayed at two exits from the Champions League in the space of three weeks.

Ultimately, the reprieve UEFA handed down after the Legia Warsaw debacle merely proved a passport to further ignominy.

The blame game is already being played with a greater intensity than Celtic managed against Maribor but Stefan Johansen is adamant the manager should not be left to carry the can.

The Norway midfielder previously worked alongside Deila at Stromsgodset – where they won a first league title in 43 years for the club – and instead feels the burden of guilt lies with those on the pitch.

‘We are a team,’ argued Johansen. ‘We lose and we win together. We had a match-plan and the players were not able to do it. So it is not the manager’s fault.

‘Of course he needs time to put his stamp on the team. I have told the media that since he came, that it takes time. It is not his fault we are out.

‘The manager made it clear what he wanted us to do and we wanted to control the game but it was us players who did not manage it.’

Johansen’s stance is correctly loyal and not without merit. But questions about Deila’s decision-making are unavoidable in the wake of such a paper-thin performance.

A clean sheet on home turf was all that was required after he seemed to get his set-up right in the 1-1 first-leg draw. Unfortunately, the composure seen in Slovenia was replaced by confusion in Scotland as Maribor pressed Celtic out of any fluency.

Blow: Adam Matthews of Celtic looks dejected

Deila’s starting line-up was a source of debate from before kick-off. The decision to omit Kris Commons was an eye-catching indication of his current status but understandable in the context of maintaining a midfield that had been effective the previous week.

The logic behind playing Efe Ambrose at right-back was less clear. The Nigerian international was all at sea during the first half, persistently out of position as if ordered to tuck inside and abandon the flank. His inclusion displaced Mikael Lustig to centre-back, where the Swede partnered Virgil van Dijk to decent effect before succumbing to injury.

It all seemed unnecessarily complicated. Young Jason Denayer was implicated in the goal conceded in the first leg but had otherwise looked to have the makings of a decent double act with van Dijk. Joining him among the subs was Adam Matthews, a Welsh international right-back who would be expected to be more reliable in the role than Ambrose.

An awful opening 45 minutes created a need for the ball to stick further forward. Deila reacted by bringing on Commons for Beram Kayal, which initially seemed to give the side a lift - albeit at the expense of lightening the central midfield.

It was somewhat more puzzling when Jo-Inge Berget was replaced by Matthews. He took up a post on the right side of midfield, with Callum McGregor switched to the left. The final change was forced by the injury to Lustig. Derk Boerrigter was introduced rather than Denayer and another reshuffle was underway. Three minutes later, Marcos Tavares struck the goal that sealed Celtic’s fate.

Berget had been grim in the first half but seemed to apply himself with real energy after the restart, contributing to an improved spell for his team. The Cardiff City loanee told Norwegian media he was surprised to be taken off.

‘I wanted to stay on the field,’ he said. ‘In the first half, we didn’t play well and nothing happened for us, but the second half was much better and I was enjoying it.

‘But the manager makes the decisions and he had a plan behind my substitution. I was certainly ready to play on and we had no agreement that I would be replaced.’

There is a sense that Deila is still grasping towards his best team and formation. Perhaps that will only be clear if and when he is able to import enough of his own players.

Questions to answer:  Celtic manager Ronny Delia has endured a tough start to his reign at the club

Aleksandar Tonev, on loan from Aston Villa, has yet to be seen because of injury. Wakaso Mubarak has now been added to the squad after his loan from Rubin Kazan was finalised, while a deal for striker Stefan Scepovic remains pending.

Will they be enough to make the difference come the Europa League group stages? The fact Legia – who routed Celtic 6-1 on aggregate - will be fourth seeds in that draw if they qualify suggests a wholesale improvement will be required.

That was recognised by Johansen as he faced up to a season without the financially-rewarding thrill of Europe’s elite competition.

‘It is early in the season and, of course, everyone wanted to play Champions League but we need to improve as players and as a team,’ said the 23-year-old.

‘We are in the Europa League, we want to win the league and the Scottish Cup. We need to get our heads up as soon as possible. It is tough now and it is going to be difficult but we need to do that.

‘To be honest, we are not good enough (for the Champions League) right now. We have the Europa League now and we have to improve.’
