Hundreds of ambulances specially designed to deal with obese patients weighing more than 50 stone have been rolled out across the UK.

Ambulance chiefs are planning to upgrade their fleet with wider doors, a stretcher for patients weighing 56 stone  and a device which can carry a person  up to 34 stone down a flight of stairs.

A quarter of British adults are obese. Experts said spending up to £100,000 for specialist ambulances demonstrates the need for tougher measures to stop people becoming overweight.

Ambulance services began introducing small numbers of specially equipped 'bariatric' vehicles about four years ago to deal with the growing obesity epidemic.  

But figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act revealed how there are now more than 800 ambulances in the UK equipped to deal with obese patients.  

One trust, the East of England Ambulance Service, recently trialled the new wider ambulances and over a period of eight months, were called upon 260 times.  

The most common call-outs were for falls or patients with blood poisoning. Paramedics said it is also now common for them to treat patients housebound by their weight. 

Tracy Nicholls of the East of England Ambulance Service, a council member of the College of Paramedics, said: 'A lot of the time we're only finding patients when they reach crisis point because they haven't sought the routine checks and help they need out of embarrassment or simply because they cannot get out of the house.

'We have situations where two or three ambulances and a fire truck arrive in a street and we have to remove a window to get the patient out of their home and that attracts a lot of attention and can be just awful for that person.

'It is really important to paramedics that they can treat patients, who are often collapsed or in an awkward situation, with dignity.  Having the right equipment and training is a big part of that.

'We don't want to be in a situation where we can't treat a patient because of their size - they deserve a good service, just like everybody else.'

The new ambulances include wider doors and a stretcher for patients weighing 56 stone 

But Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum said more should be done to tackle the obesity crisis. 

He told the Times: 'There is no getting away from the fact that if you have these people, you have to cater for them and have extra-heavy ambulances. 

'But what we're doing is spending a sack of money on treatment, when what we've really got to be doing is stopping people getting fat in the first place.'  

The East Midlands Ambulance Service said it operated 119 bariatric vehicles and aimed to upgrade its entire fleet by the end of 2017. It said this was a good use of funds as these vehicles could be used 24/7 whereas dedicated bariatric ambulances would sit idle until needed. 

South Western Ambulance Service said that 295 vehicles — 98 per cent of its fleet — could deal with bariatric patients.

Yorkshire Ambulance Service said that, since 2009, all new vehicles had been bariatric capable and it operated 183 specialist ambulances. 

The South East Coast Ambulance Service has three bariatric vehicles in its fleet which were used 534 times in the past year.

The Welsh Ambulance Service has 196 such vehicles. The West Midlands Ambulance Service said all of its vehicles were bariatric-capable but it owned or leased nine specialist ambulances

The North East Ambulance Service has two bariatric vehicles which it deployed 798 times in the past year. Although also used to deal with patients without weight problems, this is a huge increase from just 29 cases in 2008-09.
