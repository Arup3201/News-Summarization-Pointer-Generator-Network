Breast enlargement might be the UK's most popular cosmetic operation but for Sharon, 51, from the West Midlands, having large breasts is a curse.

A 34D for most of her adult life, Sharon was left in excruciating pain after her breasts increased by nine cup sizes to a 40L following a hysterectomy.

So agonising was the back pain that resulted, Sharon was forced to take daily doses of morphine and found herself unable to sit at the supper table or even stand up unaided because of her gargantuan bosom.

Painful: Sharon's breasts grew nine sizes in just two years, leaving her in agony and unable to stand unaided

Shocked: GP Dr Pixie McKenna said that Sharon's breasts were the largest she's ever seen

'They've just grown and grown and grown,' says Sharon, who appears on tonight's episode of Embarrassing Bodies. 'I'm in excruciating pain sometimes, they're just horrible things.'

Indeed, so large have Sharon's breasts become, Embarrassing Bodies GP Dr Pixie McKenna was left shocked and revealed they were the largest she had ever seen.

Sharon's problems began when she hit the menopause aged 45, with the drop in hormones resulting in a lessening of support for her breasts.

As her hormones declined, her breasts grew and with them, back pain, neck pain and a series of itchy rashes beneath her breasts.

'You could fry an egg under there,' jokes Sharon, who spends hours applying ointment and talcum powder in a bid to minimise the pain.

Despite her jokes, the effect on Sharon's confidence has been devastating. 'When I first knew Sharon. she was always dancing and singing and very jolly,' says husband Sam. 'To see her now... That's not the Sharon I'm used to seeing.'

But after years of pain, Sharon's ordeal has come to an end, courtesy of a breast reduction operation at the Ramsey West Midlands Hospital.

Under the watchful eye of plastic surgeon Sultan Hassan, the 51-year-old endured more than four hours on the operating table, as 6kg of breast tissue was removed.

She has also had to begin physiotherapy in a bid to combat the hunched posture she developed as a result of her L cup breasts.

Nevertheless, she says she is thrilled to be rid of her uncomfortably large breasts. 'It's made me feel like a woman again because all I had was these big saggy boobs but now they're amazing,' she reveals. 'I couldn't have asked for a better result.'

Her new-look bosom has also given her confidence a huge boost. 'I still can't believe it's me,' she enthuses.

'It means the world to me that I've had this operation done. I feel more confident, I feel more of a woman. I've actually got boobs and not big dangly things hanging down on my hips.

'Wearing a bra was so uncomfortable with all the sores and things under my breasts but now that's all gone!

She adds: 'I can't wait to get a bikini and show my boobs off.'
