Emma White has been jailed for a year after she attacked Dean Roche with her stiletto, shattering his cheek so he needed four plates inserted into it

A mother-of-four who broke a man's cheek in four places after she attacked him with her stiletto in a drunken rage has been jailed. 

Emma White shattered Dean Roche's cheek after she battered him with her high heeled shoe outside a Yates' Bar in Poole High Street in Dorset. 

White, of Bournemouth in Dorset, was jailed for 12 months for the unprovoked vicious attack.

Mr Roche needed four metal plates screwed into his face after the assault, launched on him as he was looking the other way as he waited in a taxi queue. 

He still has no feeling down the right side of his face eight months after White's assault.  

White initially denied the five charges she faced - two of affray, two of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and one of inflicting grievous bodily harm.

But the 28-year-old changed her plea of inflicting grievous bodily harm just days before the trial was due to start at Bournemouth Crown Court.

Mr Roche's right cheek bone was broken in four places by the impact of the heel against his face, leaving him with severe bruising around his eye, and he underwent a three-hour operation to reconstruct his cheek.

Mr Roche, 22, who works as a security guard at Asda in Poole, said: 'There was no explanation for the attack other than she was blind drunk and going wild at people.

'I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

'I'm a bit shocked that she has been sent to jail, I was expecting her to get a suspended sentence, but I do feel like justice has been served.'

The incident happened outside a Yates' bar in Poole High Street, Dorset, on April 26 last year.

Mr Roche was stood in a taxi queue when White came at him with the shoe she had already taken off and was carrying.

He said: 'I had been out for the night and was waiting for a taxi when a woman came out of nowhere and hit me on the side of my head with a stiletto.

Mr Roche said he was standing in a taxi queue when White launched the unprovoked vicious attack on him 

The security guard needed stitches and had a three-and-a-half hour operation to repair his broken cheekbone

'It was totally unprovoked. I didn't even see her coming, she came at me from the side.

'I had no idea who the woman was, I had never seen her before. She was on a rampage, hitting other people with her stiletto.

'When she hit me I was in agony - I've never felt pain like it. My mate grabbed hold of me and turned me away because he thought I had been hit in the eye.

'I went home and the next morning I went to hospital. Straight away they told me that my cheek had collapsed.

Mr Roche, pictured with his mother Karen Mason, said he still has no feeling down the right side of his face 

'They took an X-ray and found my cheekbone was shattered in four places. I had to have four metal plates put in my cheek during a three-and-a-half hour operation.

'I was signed off work for seven weeks to recover. Eight months on from the attack I still have no feeling down the right side of my face.

'For a while I was very cagey about going on nights out and the first time I went out after the attack I made sure I was in a big group of friends.

'It's been a long eight months and I'm glad it's all done and dusted now.'
