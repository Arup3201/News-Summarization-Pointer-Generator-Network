Wanted: Convicted kidnapper Peter Watton is being hunted by police across Britain over a savage rape 48 hours after his release from prison

A convicted kidnapper is today being hunted by police across Britain for allegedly raping a jogger just 48 hours after he was freed early from jail.

Fugitive career criminal Peter Watton, 37, has been described by detectives as 'risk to the public' and should not be approached.

Yet he had been allowed back on the streets by prison authorities only last week - just half way through a six year sentence for the drug fuelled abduction and robbery of a terrified teenager.

Just two days after Watton's release from jail on June 12, a female jogger, 44, was taken prisoner and raped as she was out exercising on the afternoon of Friday June 14 with her pet dog on parkland in the Handbridge area of Chester.

It is feared the woman was held for up to eight hours before she managed to escape and call police in the early hours of the following morning.

Cheshire Police has launched a massive manhunt and took the unusual step of naming Watton as the man they wanted to speak to over the attack.

A picture of a bike used by the rape 
suspect was also released. Police believe the bike may have been stolen 
and are keen to speak to anyone in the Chester area that may be missing a
grey/blue 'X rated' mountain bike.

Officers also urged other women living in the historic city not to go to isolated places alone including the banks of the River Dee.

The rape victim is being counselled by specially trained detectives and is said to be 'deeply traumatised' by her ordeal.

Probe: Police with dogs searching the area of Chester where the woman victim was raped

Watton, from Crewe, had been jailed at Chester Crown Court in July 2010 for kidnap and robbery after he and two accomplices abducted an 18-year old boy whilst armed with a screwdriver and forced him to drive them around while they tried to score drugs.

Later the lad was blindfolded and taken to a flat where Watton stole a laptop and a significant amount of clothing. He also threatened two more people whilst one of two pals - a convicted rapist- threatened to 'burn the place down.'

Watton had previously been jailed for six years in 2000 for an attempted kidnapping and had a lengthy record of dishonesty offences. He was freed on parole on June 12 under laws allowing prisoners to be released after serving half their sentences.

Today Cheshire Police said Watton was is in breach of his licence conditions and is wanted on a recall to prison but urged anyone who sees him to call 999 and not tackle him themselves.

Help: Police have released the picture of this bike, similar to the one used by the attacker in Chester

Detail: The bike is branded x-rated and police believe that it was Watton who was on it

Det Supt Andy Southcott said 'We have a number of active lines of inquiry that we are progressing and believe that Peter Watton may be able to assist us in our investigation.

'I would urge anyone who has any information about Watton's whereabouts or who sees him not to approach him but to contact Cheshire Police immediately on 999.

'My concern is not only for the public at large but also for Peter himself, and I would also appeal directly to Peter Watton to make contact with the Police or present himself at the nearest Police Station.'

Det Insp Simon Lonsdale said ' This is a very serious but isolated incident. I would like to reassure the public that we have a number of lines of enquiry that we are following and extra police and support officers will be patrolling the area.

'People using the area around Eaton Road and the River Dee should remain vigilant and take basic precautions such as not going to isolated areas alone and reporting anything untoward to police'.

Anyone with information about the whereabouts of Peter Watton should call Cheshire Police on 999 quoting incident number 6 of 15 June, or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
