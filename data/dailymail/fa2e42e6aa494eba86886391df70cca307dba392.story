The estranged wife of Marco Pierre White has been banned from going anywhere near the celebrity chef's home after she used her own blood to daub offensive graffiti on the side of the property and smashed up his Range Rover with a child's scooter.

Matilde Conejero was also given 40 hours community service after she admitted the damage, which also included writing insults in red paint.

The 47-year-old used a child’s scooter to smash the front and rear windscreens of the TV star’s top of the range 4X4 vehicle, causing £12,000 damage.

When he failed to answer the buzzer at this home, the mum-of-three used her own blood and red nail varnish to scrawl insults on the walls of the communal hallway outside his front door.

Eventually, when another woman appeared at the door, Conejero 'lurched' at her in a jealous rage and had to be restrained by police.

Nicholas Alexander, prosecuting, told Isleworth Crown Court how Pierre White, 50, was asleep at his luxury home in leafy Holland Park home on May 7 this year when he was woken by a commotion outside.

Mr Alexander said: 'He had been sleeping at the time and was awoken to be told his ex-wife was outside the property.

'He could hear noise coming from outside the property and went to the window to see what it was.

'Whilst looking through the window he could see his wife by his Range Rover, smashing the vehicle and damaging it using a child’s scooter. Extensive damage was caused to the vehicle.'

The court heard police were called 
and an officer arrived to find both windscreens had been damaged and the
panels scratched, causing thousands of pounds of damage.

Mr
Alexander continued: 'As he approached the address he noticed the 
defendant had a bleeding little finger and he noticed she was wearing 
red nail varnish.

'As he 
approached the property he saw, daubed in blood and red nail varnish, 
she had written graffiti offensive towards Mr Pierre White.

'He also noticed scratches to the Oak front door and nail varnish within the lock.'

The court was told that when the 
officer knocked on the front door, it was opened by another woman and 
Conejero 'lurched' towards her.

Conejero,
who the court heard has a previous conviction for drink driving was 
arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and escorted from the premises 
towards an awaiting police van.

In
police interviews, Conejero admitted causing the damage to the car and 
home, but said she had a right to as it was jointly hers.

She
pleaded not guilty in the Magistrate’s Court, but changed her plea to 
guilty when the Crown Prosecution Service refused to drop the charges.

But she was sentenced to the community service and also given a restraining order not to enter Addison Road in Holland Park, where the attack happened.

Pierre White, who was due to give 
evidence at the trial, was kept on the opposite side of the building 
from his wife, but through the prosecutor he said he wanted his wife’s 
behaviour to be 'observed' by the court.

Mr Alexander said: 'His personal observation would be that there needs to be some recompense to the community for these actions.

'Given
that the ultimate person who would pay any costs and compensation would
be Mr Pierre White I don’t make any specific application for costs or 
compensation.'

David Jubb, in mitigation, described 
Conejero - known as Mati - as a woman of 'impeccable character' who had 
suffered since the breakdown of her marriage to the Hell’s Kitchen chef.

Mr Jubb said: 'She was in a long-term relationship with the complainant.

'They
had been together since 1992 and married in 2000. They have been 
separated for some time and it has been an emotional and distressing 
period of time for this woman.'

Judge Philip Matthews adjourned sentencing until later this month, but indicated she did not face custody.

The Hell’s Kitchen star met third wife Conejero at his restaurant The Canteen where she worked as a bartender, and married in 2000.

In 2003, Marco Pierre White had to spend 14 hours in a cell at Notting Hill police station after a violent row with his wife where she accused him of cheating with American banker Robin Saunders.

White has denied that he was violent towards his wife, but said he had to restrain her after she threw a lamp in his face and kicked him in the groin.

Ms Conejero withdrew her accusation, but not before sending out a text to White's entire phonebook saying 'Marco Pierre White has left his wife and three children for Robin Saunders'

The pair have three children, Luciano, Marco Jr and Mirabelle.

They began divorce proceedings in 2007, after Mati stormed into Marco's restaurant Luciano’s and accused one of the waitresses of sleeping with him in front of a restaurant full of diners.

They halted proceedings them last year after running up massive legal bills totalling an estimated £3 million.

She now lives in a flat above a pizza restaurant he once owned in Chiswick, west London, with their 10-year-old daughter.

Pierre White, the youngest chef to be given three Michelin stars and who is estimated to be worth £25million, lives with the other two children.
