Rafael Nadal has confirmed he will not participate in the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London next month due to appendix surgery.

The world No 3 revealed his decision after suffering defeat to 17-year-old Borna Coric in the quarter-finals of the Swiss Indoors on Friday.

Nadal had pulled out of next week's Paris Masters earlier in the day and later announced that he was bringing his season to a close in order to undergo surgery on November 3.

He said: ‘It is the day to say goodbye for the season. I am not going to play in next week’s Paris Masters or in London. I am not competitive enough to do that.

‘It has been a very hard year for me mentally and physically too.

‘I tried to practise to try to get fit but it was not possible. It’s difficult to play and compete when you’re not able to practise weeks in a row.

‘I’m not a player who competes to try to be in quarter-finals. I try to win tournaments. I will be back at the start of 2015.’

Nadal had followed a course of antibiotics after being diagnosed with appendicitis ahead of the Shanghai Masters earlier this month.

The 28-year-old surprised some observers by competing in Basle this week and he struggled on court on Friday night, losing 6-2, 7-6 (4) to the Croatian teenage wildcard.

Coric was just three points away from claiming a first-set bagel but Nadal reeled off two games in a row before Coric finally sealed the set.

Nadal battled back in the second set and forced his young opponent to serve to stay in the set twice.

Coric duly held his nerve and claimed victory on the first of two match points in the second set tiebreak as Nadal pushed a forehand wide.

Nadal's withdrawal from the season-ending event is a boost for the qualification hopes of Andy Murray, who currently sits just inside the Race to London cut at No 8.

The British No 1 still has much work to do, though, as he faces a semi-final against fellow contender David Ferrer at the Valencia Open on Saturday.

Top seed Roger Federer remained on course for his sixth title in front of his home crowd after beating Grigor Dimitrov 7-6 (4), 6-2.
