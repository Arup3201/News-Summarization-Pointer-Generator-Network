The Mean Girls star, who is currently on stage in London's West End, said Brazil is a country she adores

Neves, a business-minded former governor and candidate of the center-right Brazilian Social Democracy Party, is currently in a runoff election with President Dilma Rousseff.

Lohan, 28, also shared the following message on Facebook: 'Brasil needs change and I support Aecio Neves! He deserves to win the presidency to push forward positive changes and policies for ALL people of Brasil, a country that I adore.'

According to the International Business Times, Neves, 53, has been trying to overcome a past reputation as a party-loving playboy with a penchant for luxury. 

La Nueva Televisora del Sur reported Neves was embrolied in a cocaine scandal last year when a helicopter owned by his company, Agropecuaria Limeira, was seized by federal police with 4.5 tons of the drug aboard.

A congressman who is a political ally of Neves, Gustavo Perella, was jailed over the scandal despite claiming that employees of Agropecuaria Limeira took the helicopter without permission.

Neves main pledges in the upcoming election are focused on business, and include tax reform, a scaled-back government role in the economy, a floating exchange rate and a boost for investment.

Translated, the caption on the post reads: 'about lindsay (and any other celeb gringa supporting any party)'
