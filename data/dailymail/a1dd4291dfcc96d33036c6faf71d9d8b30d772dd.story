Princess, a pitbull-pug mix, saw her owner being attacked and ran to the rescue in Fort Worth, Texas

A 60-year-old woman was saved by her dog named Princess after two men grabbed her computer and shoved her against a fence.

Princess, a pit bull-pug mix, saw the attack and ran to her owner's rescue in Fort Worth, Texas on January 20. 

The unnamed woman was carrying a computer out of her home when she was approached by the two men who attacked her. 

After the first man ran away with the woman's computer, the second pushed the woman against a fence, according to NBC DFW.

Princess ran up to the man, bit him on the leg and scratched him on the face as he held the woman, police said.

After being attacked, the man let the woman go and limped away.  

The Fort Worth Police Department posted a letter on their Twitter account on Tuesday congratulating the dog for her bravery. 

The letter read: 'A big congratulations and thank you to Princess for rescuing her mother and possibly saving a life! She's a big hero in our hearts and her owner's, too!' 

The force later tweeted a photo of Princess with a police officer and a man with a camera captioned, 'Princess ready for her first interview w/FWPD and @NBCDFW'. 

Police are still looking for the men who both escaped the scene.

The man who was bitten by Princess is described as a black male, 45-50 years old and six feet tall. 

He was wearing a green jacket and brown sweatpants with jeans over them at the time of the attack.

The other man is described as a Hispanic male, 24-30 years old, tall with a thin build. He was wearing a hoodie and dark pants at the time of the incident. 

The Fort Worth Police Department was grateful for Princess's heroic actions that saved her owner. Princess ran up to the man who was holding her owner to a fence, bit him on the leg and scratched him on the face
