More than 800 patients suspected of having cancer were discharged from a  hospital by mistake.

At least two of them died and a further 121 may have suffered life-threatening delays in diagnosis or treatment.

A major probe has been launched into how the clerical errors went undetected for three years.

MPs say they want managers at West Hertfordshire NHS trust to be held to account. It emerged last night that the man who was in charge at the time quit the Health Service just as the problems were coming to light.

Two managers have been suspended after a hospital trust admitted discharging hundreds of suspected cancer patients by mistake. West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust said at least one person might have died as a result of the errors and 121 patients are yet to have their cases reviewed

Jan Filochowski, who had moved on to Great Ormond Street, suddenly left the London hospital in December, saying he wanted to pursue ‘other opportunities’.

He takes with him a £3million taxpayer-funded pension pot. The mistakes affected 810 patients urgently referred to the West Hertfordshire trust for tests between 2010 and 2013 because their GP feared they had cancer.

None turned up for their initial examinations however, possibly because they did not receive appointment letters.

Given the urgency of their cases, staff should have contacted them immediately to arrange another slot.

Instead, it is thought they were removed from the computer system with no further action taken.

The blunders made some patients wait several weeks for diagnosis – with fatal results in two cases.

A review by the trust, which runs Watford, St Albans and Hemel Hempstead hospitals, found that 686 people were not harmed by the delays.

It is investigating other 121 cases and speaking to doctors and relatives.

The mistakes came to light in November when Samantha Jones, who took over from Mr Filochowski as chief executive last February, asked for a review of the system for booking cancer appointments.

A few weeks later, Mr Filochowski, 62, announced he was going to retire just a year into his Great Ormond Street posting. The married father of two gave up a £280,000 annual salary, saying he wanted to focus on NHS consultancy and business books.

He was handed a retirement lump sum payment of £412,000 on top of his £140,000-a-year pension – one of the most generous in the public sector.

Miss Jones said: ‘It is absolutely clear that the trust was not always following the correct administrative processes for these patients and we let them down.

‘These concerns date back a number of years and were identified as part of the new management team’s commitment to improve the way we administer and manage patient care.

‘I would like to apologise to each and every patient who has been affected and particularly to the relatives of those who have since died.

‘We have of course made significant changes to help prevent this ever happening again and will share the outcome of our investigations with those affected and with the wider public.’

A spokesman for the trust refused to comment on whether Mr Filochowski was at fault – but confirmed that two managers had been suspended.

Richard Harrington, Tory MP for Watford, said: ‘There is absolutely no doubt that the trust’s failure to follow the correct administrative process for urgent referrals is unacceptable, and deeply wrong.’

He has written a statement with four other local MPs calling for proper accountability of senior bosses once the investigation has finished.

Anne Main, Tory MP for St Albans, said: ‘This is an extremely worrying situation which may have health implications for my constituents.

'Frankly, the public deserve better when it comes to the NHS.’

A spokesman for the West Hertfordshire trust could not explain why the patients had not turned up for their appointments.

He said in some cases letters may have been lost in the post, others may not have been told of the urgency by their GP, while others may have just forgotten to attend.

An investigation has since been launched – overseen by Stephen Ramsden, of the Putting Patients First campaign – which will try to establish exactly how many people were affected.

Speaking from his £1.3million home in Islington, North London, last night Mr Filochowski said: ‘I’m not prepared to comment having no knowledge about the issues and it being some time since I left the trust. I will try to find something out about this.’

There is widespread evidence that cancer patients in Britain are less likely to survive than those elsewhere in Europe due to delays in diagnosis and treatment.
