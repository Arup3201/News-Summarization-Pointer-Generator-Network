NASA has released a photograph that appears to show huge fires raging across North Korea.

The pictures show large plumes of smoke over the east and southeast of Kim Jong-un’s state.

Some of the fires are apparently in farm areas and it is possible that the fires may have been set deliberately by farmers to aid in the fertilisation of the soil.

This photograph taken by a NASA satellite clearly shows plumes of smoke wafting over over the east and southeast of Kim Jong-Un¿s state

Others are in forests which means that they could be wildfires such as those that at times plague southern California and Australia or they could have been started by damaged power cables.

‘Collectively, the fires were producing enough smoke to send plumes of haze drifting east over the Sea of Japan,’ NASA said on its website.

The 
pictures come a month after North Korea launched its own space agency 
NADA and has ‘borrowed’ the logo from its American counterpart.

The images were taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite, earlier this week.

North Korea has launched a remarkable attack on the United States three months after its human rights abuses were exposed by the United Nations (UN).

According to the UN, North Korea is committing human rights violations ‘without any parallel in the contemporary world’.

In response, the secretive state has issued its own report claiming that the United States and its allies were running a ‘human rights racket’ and demanding to know how a homosexual could lead an investigation into human rights. (Michael Kirby, an openly gay former Justice of the High Court of Australia, led a three-member UN panel that spent a year investigating abuses in the country.)

Now the Korean Central News Agency has published an article entitled News Analysis on Poor Human Rights Records in US

It claimed that America has racial discrimination, unemployment, surveillance and poverty concluding ‘The US is the world's worst human right abuser and tundra of a human being's rights to existence’.

It alleged: ‘The US is a living hell as elementary rights to existence are ruthlessly violated.

‘The number of impoverished people increased to 46.5 million last year, and one sixth of the citizens and 20-odd percent of the children are in the grip of famine in New York City.

‘All sorts of crimes rampant in the US pose a serious threat to the people's rights to existence and their inviolable rights.

‘The US government has monitored every movement of its citizens and foreigners, with many cameras and tapping devices and even drones involved, under the pretext of "national security".‘

Fires could be caused by farmers fertilising land or poor infrastructure
