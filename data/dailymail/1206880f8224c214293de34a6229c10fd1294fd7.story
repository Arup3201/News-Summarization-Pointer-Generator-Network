It is a cruel irony for the millions of holidaymakers who slam Ryanair for charging them for hidden ‘extras’ while flying.

Because soon, the budget airline’s passengers will feel grateful for the chance just to spend a penny.

For it plans to rip out even more toilets from its planes – whittling them down to just one loo per aircraft.

No stranger to controversy: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary argues that the move would ultimately benefit passengers, as it 'would fundamentally lower air fares by about five per cent.'

The move, which takes ‘no frills 
travel’ to a whole new level, could see 200 passengers vying to share 
one facility – forcing them either to wait in very long queues or cross 
their legs and pray.

Michael O'Leary's plan is the latest scheme from the budget airline. Some have been implemented, while others have not. They include...

Charging passengers £1 to use the toilet on flights

Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O’Leary said he wants to replace the toilets with extra passenger seats 
in order to offer cheaper air fares.

He is pressing Boeing to 
‘re-certify’ Ryanair’s aircraft to enable six extra seats to be 
installed, particularly for short-haul flights.

The airline flies only one type of 
aircraft type, the Boeing 737-800. It has 189 seats on each plane, the 
maximum allowed under current rules.

Fitting six extra seats would mean 
ripping out two of the three loos – leaving 200 passengers to share just
one. But Mr O’Leary insists: ‘We very rarely use all three toilets on 
board our aircraft anyway.’

The move ‘would fundamentally lower 
air fares by about 5 per cent for all passengers – cutting £2 from a 
typical £40 ticket’, he added.

There is no legal stipulation for an 
airline to provide toilets on its aircraft. Boeing declined to be drawn 
on the plans, saying: ‘We don’t discuss those conversations.’

The budget airline has announced plans to remove two of the three lavatories from its planes - a move that it believes will allow space for up to six extra seats

Ryanair will carry 75million 
passengers this year. Its longest UK route is from Rhodes to Liverpool, 
taking four hours and 25 minutes. Initially, though, the higher-capacity
aircraft would be deployed on shorter routes.

A spokesman for the Association of 
British Travel Agents said: ‘We all know how inconvenient it can be if a
toilet on a plane is out of order. This move could be a step too far.’

But aviation consultant John 
Strickland said: ‘High fuel prices are making it difficult for even 
Ryanair to keep fares low, so anything which helps reduce costs is 
essential.’

Last summer Ryanair said it planned to
introduce flights where passengers stand up rather than sit, from £4 
per ticket. The plan would remove the back ten rows of seats from its 
250 planes and replace them with 15 rows of vertical seats.

The Office of Fair Trading is investigating a ‘super-complaint’ by the Consumers’ Association into charges by low-cost airlines.

Ryanair – which charges up to £20 per 
piece of checked luggage per flight – faced outcry in 2009 for plans to 
charge passengers a pound to visit the plane toilet. The plans to 
‘charge a pound to spend a penny’ have now been dropped, Mr O’Leary 
said.
