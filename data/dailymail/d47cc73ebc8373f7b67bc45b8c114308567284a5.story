Like a scene out of Ghostbusters, the sickening images of the oozing, putrid grease blocking London's sewers made even those with the strongest stomachs queasy.

The stinking mass of lard, and much worse, highlighted Britain's love of cooking oil - and how we think nothing of throwing it down our sinks.

Now the double-decker sized blockage is getting worse, after experts discovered three tonnes had been added to the mass since its discovery last month.

Fatberg: The mass of lard and other household waste has grown by a huge three tonnes since its discovery in the sewers of London

Despite engineers' efforts to remove the then 15 ton mass and pleas from the water company, fresh grease is continuing to clog up our sewers.

The blockage was so critical at one point it threatened to blast the covers off manholes in Kingston with raw sewage.

But Thames Water contracts supervisor Gordon Hailwood said a campaign for customers to bin their fat has done little to ease the problem.

Growing: Despite pleas from Thames Water, customers are still getting rid of their cooking oil in their sinks rather than their bins

He said: 'This sewer pipe collects the sewage from across most of Kingston so it could be coming from anywhere.

'Old, congealed fat is white, but this was yellow in colour, so it’s been put into the sewers over the last few weeks.

'We’ve
 spent a lot of time drawing attention to the dangers of putting fat 
down the drain, so I can’t imagine where these huge amounts are coming 
from.'

Heavy cost: The repair bills to fix problems caused by fat blockages in London have now reached £1million

Mr Hailwood adds: 'We need everyone to treat these sewers better. And that means one thing: Bin it - don’t block it.'

This issue is nothing new, but in the late Nineties, Thames Water spent £2 million a year removing fat from its network - that figure bulged to £12million in 2012.

It's not only disgarded cooking oil which is adding to the current batch of Fatbergs, a 15 per cent annual rise in wet wipes has also been blamed - a product our Victorian sewers cannot deal with.

Simon Evans, a Thames Water spokesman, said: ‘We are seeing an increasing trend across Britain of people using wet-wipes instead of loo roll. Goodness knows why.

Discovery: Thames Water workers were shocked to find the original 15-ton blockage in August

Residents alerted engineers to the 'fatberg' after they complained of not being able to flush their toilets

‘Our sewers are designed to take human waste and loo roll, and nothing else.

'When a wipe goes down, it doesn’t break down. Manufacturers say they do eventually, but that’s in a landfill site. In contrast, loo roll breaks down in seconds.

‘No moistened wipe has yet to come on the market that is acceptable to sewers.’
