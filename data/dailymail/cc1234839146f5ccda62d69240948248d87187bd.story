Republicans are bracing for a 'wave' election on Tuesday that could put them in control of both houses of Congress for the last two years of Barack Obama's presidency.

They already run the House of Representatives, and expect to enlarge their majority. But the battle royale is in the Senate, where the GOP's 45 seats could become as many as 54 by the time the dust settles.

'Democrats are expecting an old-school shellacking,' a campaign consultant  who worked for Obama's 2012 campaign in Iowa told MailOnline on Monday. He was promised anonymity so he could speak freely.

'President Obama has been the worst thing that could have happened to Dems in the Senate this year. Everything Obama touches this year turns to s**t. The Republicans are going to laugh all the way back to Washington, and the president is going to be on defense until he leaves.'

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, though, insisted on Monday the president believes Democrats will retain control of the Senate. And Vice President Joe Biden said CNN that he doesn't 'agree with the oddsmakers. I predict we're gonna ... keep the Senate.'

HAPPY AS A PIG IN SLOP: Republican former hog farmer Joni Ernst looks to upset Rep. Bruce Braley Tuesday in Iowa

IS IT ENOUGH? Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (left) brought out Hillary Clinton's big guns to help her combat former Republican Sen. Scott Brown in New Hampshire

Obama has largely stayed off the campaign trail as his fellow Democrats find it a liability to be seen with him in public.

He showed up in Michigan on Saturday to help Congressman Gary Peters – who is already leading by an insurmountable margin.

Iowa is one of the most hotly contested races, with both Bill and Hillary Clinton showing up in person in recent weeks.

Nationally, the electoral map favors Republicans this year because Democrats are defending just 15 of the 21 seats up for grabs.

In 2016 the tables will be turned, however, leaving the GOP with a two-year window to bring sweeping changes to Washington – with a recalcitrant president standing in their way.

A cavalcade of Republican senators and Senate hopefuls have promised voters everything from new trade authorizations to a complete repeal of the Obamacare medical insurance law if they find themselves in charge Wednesday morning.

Obama would veto a mass-scale rewrite of the Affordable Care Act, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and other hard-line conservatives have suggested firing off an endless series of bills attacking individual portions of the law – putting the president in a position to either compromise or accept the label of obstructionist.

'I am absolutely convinced that you’re going to see with a Republican led Senate – if we are lucky enough to get that – you’re going to see bills get to the president’s desk,' 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said Sunday on the Fox News Channel. 

'He will sign some. Some he won’t sign, no question about that. He’ll veto some, but I think at that point we’ll find out who really is "the party of no".'

IMPOTENT? Obama will be powerless to dictate the terms of legislation or stop Senate votes from happening if Republicans perform Tuesday as expected

Just weeks ago the Senate election outcome seemed anyone's guess.

But the final opinion polls have put enough contests in the likely 'win' column for the Republican Party that even analysts atThe Washington Post, which typically supports Democrats, has acknowledged that the GOP has a 94 per cent chance of winning Senate control.

In New Hampshire, former Republican Sen. Scott Brown has turned a deficit into a 1-point lead, according to an New England College poll released late Sunday night. 

The once-tight Iowa race has turning into a runaway, with former pig farmer Joni Ernst going ahead of Democratic Congressman Bruce Braley by 7 points in a Des Moines Register poll.

Ernst, who grew up on a hog farm, put herself on the map during the primary season with an ad recalling her chore castrating pigs – as a signal that she would 'cut pork' in Washington.

Incumbent Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu looks to be in serious trouble in Louisiana, despite leading Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy by eight points in Sunday's NBC News/Marist poll. 

A quirk in the Pelican State's election law provides for a runoff if no candidate wins 50 per cent of the vote and avoid a December 6 runoff. In the same poll, voters said they would prefer Cassidy by a 50-45 margin in a head-to-head do-over.

Georgia is the other state with a runoff clause in its election law. That race, pitting Democratic former nonprofit leader Michelle Nunn against Republican businessman David Perdue, might not be decided until January 6 – three days after the new Congress is sworn in.

That scenario, comical for its timing, looks to become a reality.

Perdue has led in each of the last five polls, but by only 2 or 3 points – not enough to push him over the 50 per cent mark.

The spoiler is Amanda Swafford, a Libertarian Party candidate who is pulling enough votes from Perdue to keep him from winning the seat outright on Tuesday.

The other wild card is in Kansas, where a court battle allowed independent pol Greg Orman to replace the only Democrat on the ballot.

If he beats incumbent Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, he could choose to caucus with either party.

That race is a statistical dead heat according to a new Fox News poll, with Roberts ahead by only a single percentage point.

If Republicans have only 50 Senate seats at the end of the night, he could play the role of kingmaker – with Republicans and Democrats wooing him with promises of committee chairmanships and pork-barrel projects for his home state.

Should the final numbers read 50-50, Biden would exercise his official role an President of the Senate and cast tiebreaking votes – leaving things in the hands of Democratic Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid.

Other races are tightening as Election Day draws near. In Colorado, Republican Rep. Tom Cotton's lead over Democratic Sen. Mark Udall has shrunk from 6 points to just 2 in the past two weeks, according to the latest Quinnipiac University poll.

The GOP expects to snatch Democratic seats easily in West Virginia, South Dakota and Montana, anomalous 'red' states that elected Democrats six years ago when President Obama's massive support at the polls benefited his party in other races.

Democrats will handily hold on to their seats in Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New Mexico and Minnesota.

Staying in the GOP column without a struggle will be Oklahoma, Maine, Tennessee and Idaho.

LOSING IT: Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada could find himself out of a leadership job if Republicans perform as expected

Alaska is a toss-up, with incumbent Sen. Mark Begich struggling to mobilize the state's native tribes that have traditionally sided with Democrats in the way African Americans have in the 'lower 48' states.

North Carolina is in the same boat, as Sen. Kay Hagan tries to hold on against Republican Thom Tillis, a member of the state legislature. 

Kentucky looks to remain with Sen. Mitch McConnell, likely the next Senate Majority Leader, who is handily leading the state's Secretary of State, Alison Lundergan Grimes by trading on both his voting record and his seniority.

'It gives our state an enormous advantage, he said in a weekend stump speech, 'to have the agenda setter for the entire country looking out for Kentucky on a daily basis.'

Grimes also shot herself in the foot in October by refusing to say if she had voted for the politically nuclear Obama.

Then the real battle begins as Congress will send bill after bill to the president and force him to sign them or be labeled an obstructionist
