Alexandra Klimenko was picking up her youngest child from nursery when the sudden violent explosion shook the Ukrainian street. 

When the dust cleared, they would find the 33-year-old's body shielding her beloved three-year-old daughter. 

Alexandra - called Sashinka by friends and family - was dead, killed by a rocket launched 80 miles away by a pro-Russian rebel.

In the Ukraine - just a four hour flight away from the safety of the UK - carrying on everyday tasks can prove fatal, and even hiding in your home will not shield you from the rockets the two sides are firing at each other.

Devastated: Alexander Klimenko says goodbye to his wife Alexandra, who was killed by a rebel rocket

Tragedy: The body of Vladimir Kolozin lies in the street next to the biscuits he had bought from the shop. His wife Tanya was killed seconds later in a separate attack, which saw a missile hit the couple's balcony

Since fighting broke out between the Ukrainian government and the Moscow-backed separatists almost a year ago, nearly 6,000 people have been killed.

The fierce fighting has driven an estimated 1million people from their homes.

A ceasefire agreed in Minsk last week, which should have seen both sides start to withdraw from a 'buffer zone' around the front line from Sunday, has had little effect.

Indeed, rebels said they had no intention of observing the ceasefire at Debaltseve, where they have been advancing since January and now have a Ukrainian unit all but encircled.

Meanwhile, one rebel commander claimed the Ukrainian army had broken the ceasefire 27 times in the just 24 hours.

Images of the conflict circulating in western media show tanks, soldiers and the occasional bursts of rockets being launched.

What they rarely show are the people still trapped between the two warring factions, desperately trying to carry on with their everyday lives - just like millions across Europe.

Broken: The ceasefire agreed between the two sides is not being stuck to by either the government or rebels

Clean up: Residents who have not fled the battle zones are left to deal with the consequences of the war

One million: It is estimated up to a million people have left since the war started almost a year ago

Destroyed: Igor shows of the damage to his flat after last Tuesday's assault on Kramtorsk

So it is easy to forget the countless stories of loss, and the suffering Europe has not experienced since the genocidal bloodletting that engulfed the Balkans in the 1990s. 

On February 10, Alexandra became another of those countless stories.

She had left her home in Kramatorsk, a city to the north of Donetsk, to pick up her daughter from nursery.

She was in a rush: her seven-year-old son was at home, ill with the flu, and she wanted to get back to him as quickly as possible.

But she never returned home. Instead, she was killed by a Tornado rocket – one of the most sophisticated weapons in Moscow’s arsenal - when she was a couple of steps from the entrance to her building.

Several other shells had landed around her, tearing massive holes into the sides of buildings, shattering windows and destroying cars.

Mourning: The graves of fighters without names marked with numbers in the cemetery of Mospyne

Her neighbours said she’d thrown herself on top of her daughter to protect her from the explosions.

Shrapnel from the rocket tore into the child’s arm and killed Alexandra instantly.

‘My neighbour told me to call her after we heard the explosions. I never thought anything might happen,’ recalled Alexandra’s aunt, Tatyana Alexandrovna, in her flat Saturday.

‘She hadn’t phoned all day and I knew her son had been ill for a couple of days. 

'Normally, her going to the day care earlier than usual wouldn’t have warranted a phone call,’ she added.

Her aunt attempted to reach her via mobile phone at least half a dozen times.

‘I kept calling and calling…there was no answer. I tried again, then again. The mobile provider kept giving me a message that she wasn’t available. 

'Finally I got through and a very hesitant man’s voice was on the other end, ‘ said Tatyana.

‘Where is my Sashinka?’

‘She’s dead. A shell exploded and killed her. I’m sorry,’ said the voice before hanging up.

‘I froze. I just didn’t know what to do,' Tatyana said. 

'My neighbour got me together and insisted we go to her flat. When we arrived the neighbours told us the emergency teams had taken her to a nearby hospital with all those who’d been wounded. 

'We rushed there hoping that maybe the man on the phone had been wrong; maybe she was just hurt and still alive. 

'When we got to the emergency room the doctors told us she was dead on arrival and that they may have to amputate her daughter’s arm.'

At Alexandra’s funeral, relatives and friends as well as her distraught husband decried the on going violence, blaming all involved for waging war on the local population.

Her son has yet to be told of his mother’s death.

‘I wanted to take him to the coffin and let him kiss mummy goodbye. I just couldn’t do it. He keeps asking for her. I have no idea what to do,’ said her husband Alexander, who works in Moscow.

‘The little one in the hospital doesn’t speak expect for when asleep, calling out for mum. We’re just happy the doctors didn’t have to amputate,’ said Tatyana Alexandrovna. 

‘We still need to tell her 93-year-old grandmother. She’s been asking about her for days, wondering why, “my Sashinka hasn’t come to visit.” We still don’t know how to tell her what happened.’ 

On a different part of the city, another family is coming to terms with its own horrendous tragedy - a tragedy which serves to show arbitrary cruelty of this civil war.

Vladimir Kolozin, a 62-year-old former engineer and director at the city’s NKMZ machine factory, was returning home after buying biscuits a rocket exploded less than five feet away.

The blast threw him against the wall of the building behind him, nearly blowing off his face in the process.

Waste: It was hoped the ceasefire would bring an end to the deaths of civilians and fighters like this one

Picking up the pieces: All the people left behind can do is try to continue to live their lives

Splayed out on the frozen pavement, his newly bought biscuits lay just a few inches from the hand that was carrying them home.

Seconds later, his wife Tamara - who was awaiting his return home for their midday meal - was killed as a second rocket ripped through the couple’s balcony.

All three - Alexandra, Vladimir and Tanya - were killed in the same spate of attacks last Tuesday. 

On Saturday, Kolozin’s former colleagues participated in a citywide vigil for those killed in last Tuesday’s attack.

Far from being unique, it was one of hundreds which have rained down on countless towns in eastern Ukraine. 

Caught between the combatants, the civilians that are forced to endure the horror of indiscriminate shelling.

Nearly 14,000 people have been wounded since fighting between Ukrainian armed forces and pro-Moscow rebels, backed by regular Russian army units, began last April.

Shattered: Windows in Kramatorsk have been blown in by the blasts - letting freezing air into homes

Destruction: Despite the chaos around them, people remain hopeful things might change for the better. 'It was a lovely flat once,' Igor told MailOnline. 'Once all of this is over and Putin leaves us alone, It will be again'

As has been the case on dozens of occasions in Donetsk, Slavyansk, Debaltsevo and Mariupol, Kramatorsk’s emergency room surgeons had to work frantically to care for the dozens of wounded flooding in the door, while nurses and orderlies were charged with trying to console family members that had packed into the dark hospital corridors.

‘My husband is in surgery. They won’t tell me anything other than to wait. He was just at work like any other day,’ a distraught young woman named Marina said in the city’s main hospital, shortly after last week’s attack.

Those who survive are left to pick up the pieces; comforting distraught relatives and cleaning up their shattered homes. 

Yana, whose flat is around the corner from where Kolozin and his wife were killed, is one of those people.

‘I was sitting here in my bedroom – my husband had just decided to go downstairs to the shop when I heard heavy concussion explosions,' she told MailOnline. 

'Luckily, I had just walked into the next room when a shell exploded right outside our balcony.'

Yana and her husband Igor, a couple in the mid-50s, have spent most of their life savings from their meagre earnings as engineers to refurbish their flat in an old Stalin-era building in the city centre.

Amid the shattered glass, pock marked walls are the couple’s charming collection bric-a-brac from their trips to Thailand, Goa and Singapore.

‘Well, it was a lovely flat once. Once all of this is over and Putin leaves us alone, It will be again,’ said Igor.
