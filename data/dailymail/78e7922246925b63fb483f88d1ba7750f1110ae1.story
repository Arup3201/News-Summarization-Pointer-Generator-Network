The elderly are being denied life-saving operations in a postcode lottery of age discrimination in the NHS, figures show.

Some patients over 75 are six times more likely to have operations to remove cancer than those living in other areas where doctors have written them off because of their dates of birth.

Age discrimination in the NHS has been illegal since last October and patients can take doctors, hospitals or GP organisations to court if they think they have been unfairly denied treatment.

But figures uncovered by the Lib Dem MP Paul Burstow reveal patients’ chances of having surgery to remove tumours, hip and knee replacements and other vital procedures depend on where they live.

Mr Burstow, a former health minister, and campaigners say the variations are so marked they can only be caused by age discrimination in some areas. The figures show that women aged 75 in Mid Devon are almost six times more likely to have surgery to remove breast cancer than those living  in Birmingham.  

There were 325 such operations per 100,000 in this age group in the Mid Devon Primary Care Trust last year, compared with just 52 in the Heart of Birmingham PCT.

Similarly, patients over 75 in Dacorum, Hertfordshire, are 12 times more likely to get knee replacements than those in Brent, North London. The rates are 665 per 100,000 in this age group in Dacorum, but only 54 in Brent.

Mr Burstow said: ‘These figures reveal a postcode lottery of age discrimination. In some parts of the country, life-saving surgery  is not being made available to older people.

‘If things don’t change thanks to the ban on age discrimination in the NHS, older people can take action to make sure they are not treated as second-class citizens.

‘The NHS should provide people of all ages with the best possible quality healthcare. Decisions on whether a person receives an operation should only ever be made on the basis of individual assessments and never because of a person’s date of birth.’

Michelle Mitchell, of the charity Age UK, said: ‘The clear implication of these figures is that many older people, particularly in certain areas of the country, still face unfair, discriminatory and potentially illegal practice in the NHS.

‘Everyone deserves fair access to medical care, yet older people’s health and even their lives are at risk if arbitrary decisions are made about their care based on their age rather than clinical need. We cannot allow healthcare to be a postcode lottery, with older people in some areas paying a high price.

‘The ban on age discrimination was an important step forward, but these figures show there is a lot further to go before every older person can be confident there’s a level playing field when it comes to their treatment on the NHS.’

The figures – which also compare the numbers of operations for bowel cancer, gallstones and hernias – suggest that the worst areas for age discrimination are Brent in North London, Bromley in Kent, Harrow, also in North London, and Sefton in Liverpool.

The Mail has long called for improvements in the care of older patients as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign.

As a result of last year’s amendment to the Equality Act making age discrimination illegal, patients can also take legal action if they believe they have been neglected or not treated with dignity or respect by nursing staff.

Decisions on operations are normally made by consultants. In some cases, patients may be too frail for surgery or a general anaesthetic. But campaigners say doctors should always assess them face-to-face rather than just looking at the date of birth in their medical records.
