The Duke of Cambridge has backed a music video made in Sierra Leone about tackling the spread of ebola, telling people in West Africa: 'Keep safe - the world is thinking of you'.

William recorded a video message for local film makers Future View who created the song Ebola is Real to educate people on how to prevent the transmission of the disease.

The Duke, whose heartfelt message was posted on Future View’s Twitter account  and on YouTube, paid tribute to those working in the region in the fight against the virus.

Heartfelt: The Duke of Cambridge has recorded a heartfelt message on behalf of Future View

Since the first cases were discovered in Guinea in December last year, 14,413 victims have been recorded worldwide, although the vast majority are in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.

Of these, 5,504 have died according to figures supplied by the World Health Organisation, of which 1,545 have been in Sierra Leone.

The WHO has also warned that at current rates of infection, up to 10,000 new cases could be being diagnosed each week by mid December. 

'I’ve been watching with great concern what’s been happening in West Africa due to ebola,' said William in the video which was recorded at Kensington Palace.

'I wanted to take time to add my name to this video by Future View called Ebola is Real. It’s an educational piece that will keep you guys safe on how to treat and prevent the spread of ebola.

Plea: In it, he asks locals to 'stay safe' and said 'the world is thinking of you'

Tragedy: So far, 14,413 confirmed victims of the disease have been recorded according to WHO

'Health care workers down in West Africa have been doing a tremendous job and long may that continue. 

'I want to congratulate them on the tackling and prevention of the disease - it’s a horrible disease and working in very difficult circumstances.

'So please listen to the health care workers. They know what they’re talking about. I just want to say keep safe - the world is thinking of you and be safe.'

Future View is based in Sierra Leone and supported in the UK by Purple Field Productions, and has spearheaded efforts to raise awareness of the disease.

British troops and medical experts are currently stationed in the country and are helping to build an emergency hospital to treat victims of the disease. 

Help: British hospital ship RFA Argus docked in Sierra Leonese capital Freetown late last month

Building: British army personnel have constructed this Kerry Town facility for ebola victims 

Initiative: Among initiatives aimed at helping ebola victims is the new Band Aid 30 Christmas single

Other initiatives on behalf of Africa's ebola victims include a DEC charity appeal and a new version of Do They Know It's Christmas featuring One Direction and vlogger Zoella, among others.

The new video message is the Duke's second in two days, after he took to film yesterday in an appeal on behalf of the endangered pangolin - or scaly anteater as it's also known.

In that video, he called for efforts to stop poaching to be stepped up and warned that the animal could 'die out in my lifetime'.

'The humble pangolin, a scaly anteater, is one of the most endangered animals on the planet because of poaching,' he said.

'The pangolin runs the risk of becoming extinct before most people have even heard of them.'
