Archaeologists believe they have discovered the oldest depiction of spiders in the world.

A ‘very unusual’ carving, which is thought to be of arachnids, was found on the west wall of a sandstone valley in the Kharga Oasis in Egypt.

It is thought to have been carved in 4,000 BC by prehistoric man, although the identification of the lines as spiders is rather tentative and no one is sure why they were drawn.

The rock panel, which is now in two pieces, is said to show a few spiders and a web (next to the spider on the far left) as well as extra enigmatic lines that could be insects trapped by the spiders, plants or tubes of silk, Professor Ikram said

The panel, discovered in the desert some 108 miles (175km) west of Luxor, is positioned to be illuminated by the morning sun.

Egyptologist Salima Ikram, a professor at the American University in Cairo who is also co-director of the North Kharga Oasis Survey Project, told LiveScience the find is ‘very unusual’.

‘The images are noteworthy if they are indeed spiders, as these would be unique depictions of such creatures in Old World rock art,’ she wrote in the journal Sahara.

Interestingly, a piece of rock broken off of the main panel shows what could be a harvestman insect, which is drawn in a different style to the other ‘spiders’.

While archaeologists are excited by the discovery, they are also baffled as no other examples of this kind have ever been found in Egypt or anywhere else in the world.

Spiders are also rarely depicted in ancient Egyptian carvings, adding to the mystery.

The only hieroglyphs showing spiders are from religious texts depicting the ‘opening of the mouth’ ritual, which was performed on a mummy to restore its senses for use in the afterlife, according to Professor Ikram.

Archaeologists believe the spiders perhaps held religious significance to prehistoric people.

Arachnologist Hisham El-Hennawy said Argiope lobata spiders that live in the western and eastern deserts of the country and bask in the sun in the middle of their orb webs, could have been the inspiration for the ancient artwork and have religious meaning to people.

Writing in the Sahara article, she said: ‘This would combine the force of the sun and the ability of this solar creature to survive its heat successfully, and thus be worthy of reverence or totemic allegiance.’

There is one theory that the artwork might have acted as a warning as some spiders are known to bite people, which would have threatened prehistoric people.

Of course, someone might just have liked spiders and carved images of them in a rock without intending it to have a meaning, Professor Ikram said.
