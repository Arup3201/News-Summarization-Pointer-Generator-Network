A former mayor has been banned from attending her daughter's graduation after molesting a 14-year-old boy from the same high school.

A judge ruled Friday that Linda Lusk, 53, waited too long to appeal the superintendent and school board's denial of her request in March.

Lusk was officially barred from school district activities after pleading guilty in 2011 to inappropriately touching Bubba Frank, her daughter Karlie's ex-boyfriend and classmate at Prosser High School in Washington.

Lusk was investigated after Frank bragged to friends about his sexual encounters with Lusk, who was the wife of the school principal Kevin Lusk.

Lusk, a former mayor of Prosser, said she sent multiple written requests to the superintendent asking for an injunction to attend the June 7 graduation.

However Rocky Johnson, the district’s attorney, told the judge in Benton County Superior Court  that Lusk had ample time to appeal the ban. Lusk has 30 days to appeal a decision or waive her right to challenge it in court.

He said Lusk was creating a media frenzy by bringing the issue to court so close to graduation weekend, according to the Yakima Herald.

'We fully believe the 30-day provision would apply and that Ms. Lusk did not exercise that right of appeal,' Johnson said.

Lusk's attorney Greg Dow, however, argued the 30-day rule is only for decisions and orders, not school policies.

'Apparently parents have no right to 
challenge school board policy unless they appeal within 30 days of 
enactment. We are in America, we want the right to appeal everything,' Dow said.

Judge Vic VanderSchoor upheld the school's decision, ruling that Lusk waited too long to appeal.

The ruling means it will be difficult for Lusk to attend any district events as long as she is a registered sex offender.

Lusk has made several requests to attend district events since the initial no-trespass order was issued in August 2012. Every request has been denied.

In a sit-down interview with ABC News's 20/20 program last year, Lusk preempted that she would be banned from her daughter's graduation.

In 2011, Lusk pleaded guilty with an Alford plea in which a defendant maintains she did not commit a crime but admits prosecutors have enough information to convict her.

The mother-of-five served two months of a 90-day jail sentence with a year of probation and registered as a level-one sex offender.

This meant Lusk couldn't attend many of her children's extracurricular activities or even their birthday parties until her probation ended in 2012.

'The fact that I've been denied access to their parent-teacher conferences gives me grave concern that they're going to deny my access to graduation,' Lusk told ABC News's 20/20.

Lusk's family supported her throughout the aftermath of the sex scandal, including her husband Kevin Lusk. However he filed for divorce in June 2012, which was finalized in 2013.

According to court documents, Lusk's 'relationship' with Frank began in early 2010 and culminated in a sexual encounter at her home in April.

Frank reportedly told a group of Prosser High School students about the incident.

It wasn't until May 31 that the boy's coach learned about what had happened, prompting detectives to investigate.

Benton County sheriff's detectives' investigative reports obtained by the Tri-City Herald claimed Lusk intitated contact and Frank played along with sexts from Lusk.

At her home, Lusk was said to have removed Frank's clothing and performed a sex act with him. He said the encounter was interrupted after a few minutes when he received a text message and returned to school.

Frank also shared his story and revealed his identity on ABC News's 20/20 program.
