An almost-complete skeleton of a woolly mammoth, complete with tusks, is being offered up in a rare auction. 

The specimen, which is an incredible 11.4ft (3.5 metres) high and 18ft (5.5 metres) long, is expected to attract bidders from both museums and private collectors.

Rupert van Der Werff, director of Summers Place Auctions that is selling the mammoth, says the Ice Age remains could fetch up to £250,000 ($409,000).

'Nearly complete skeletons are pretty rare. This is a fabulous skeleton in pretty good condition,' he told Ashish Joshi at Sky News.

'All sorts of people are collectors. The most famous ones are John Travolta and Leonardo DiCaprio. It's something to really show off about.'

The woolly mammoth is thought to be a male who would have weighed over six tonnes when it roamed Earth 10,000 years ago.

Resurrecting a prehistoric creature might seem like a sci-fi dream, but scientists say they have taken a step towards cloning the extinct woolly mammoth and there is a 'high chance' it will happen.

Experts expect to extract ‘high quality DNA’ from a 43,000-year-old carcass found in Siberia.

The announcement follows the autopsy on the female mammoth found last year in permafrost in Russia's diamond region of the Sakha Republic, which is also known as Yakutia.

There was palpable excitement among the team which included scientists from Russia, the UK, the USA, Denmark, South Korea and Moldova,’ The Siberian Times reported.

The researchers expect test results on blood extracted from the woolly mammoth to provide the genetic material needed to attempt to clone the animal.

Woolly mammoths finally died out in eastern Siberia around 4,000 years ago.

Radik Khayrullin, vice president of the Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists, said: ‘The data we are about to receive will give us a high chance to clone the mammoth.’

But he called for responsibility in bringing the ancient beast back to life, urging that competing teams seeking to win a race to clone the mammoth, not to play God for the sake of it.

Rupert van Der Werff, director of Summers Place Auctions that is selling the mammoth, says the Ice Age remains could fetch up to £250,000 ($409,000)

James Rylands, of Summers Place Auctions, said: 'What’s exceptional about this one is it’s more or less complete with two magnificent tusks. There are one or two toes missing.

'It looks very impressive, the inside curve of the tusks is about 8ft (2.4 metres). It’s bigger than an elephant.' 

It would have been covered in long fur on top, with a shorter undercoat. Although quite similar to today's elephant, it had smaller ears and a shorter tail to retain heat.

Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, stretching across northern Eurasia and North America, so its diet was mainly grass and rushes, which explains why it only had four molar teeth and curved tusks.

The woolly mammoth co-existed with early humans, who hunted them for food and used their bones and tusks for making art.

Woolly mammoths and modern-day elephants are closely related, sharing 99.4 per cent of their genes.

Mammoth remains can be dated from the rings on the tusks. A thick line denotes a year and a thinner line the weeks and days in between.

Their trunks had two finger-like projections at the end to help them pluck vegetation.

Japanese scientists are working on a project to bring the species back from extinction using DNA from a carcass and an egg from an elephant which will act as the surrogate mother.

The species gets its name from the Russian ‘mammut’, meaning earth mole, because it was once believed they lived underground and died on contact with light – explaining why they were always half-buried.

Up until now, the mammoth has been part of an old Eastern European private collection. Due to its huge size, it has only been pieced together recently.

'To the best of my knowledge, I don’t think there has been one sold at auction, certainly not in the UK and I don’t think in Europe, so it’s a first in that respect,' said Mr Rylands. 

'It could either go to a museum or if you have a big conservatory it would definitely make a serious statement.

'It’s not like a number 14 bus, there isn’t going to be another one coming along.' 

The mammoth will be sold at Summer Place Auctions' 'Evolution' sale on Wednesday, 26 November in Billingshurst, West Sussex.

Last year a diplodocus skeleton sold at auction for more than £400,000 ($654,000).
