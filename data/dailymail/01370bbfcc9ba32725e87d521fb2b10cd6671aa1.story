A couple who prayed and rubbed olive oil on their dying son rather than calling 911 have been sentenced to more than six years behind bars.

Dale and Shannon Hickman, both 26, were convicted of manslaughter in September for the death of their son, David.

The baby boy was born two months 
early at his grandmother's home and died nine hours later when he had 
trouble breathing and turned blue.

On Monday, a judge told the couple, who are members of a controversial Oregon faith-healing church, that they could have done more to save their baby.

Guilty: Dale and Shannon Hickman wait to be taken into custody at Clackamas County Court, Oregon after being jailed for six years for the death of their son

They cried and hugged after being sentenced to 75 months in prison and three years of 
probation.

Sentencing the couple at Clackamas County Court, Oregon, Judge Robert Herndon said: 'As the evidence unfolded and the witnesses testified, it became evident to me and certainly to the jury … that this death just simply did not need to occur.'

He added that in the trial in September, the jury had come back with a verdict in a 'stunningly' short time.

During the trial, prosecutors explained David was born with a bacterial infection and underdeveloped lungs and had a 99 per cent chance of survival with medical care.

Mr Hickman said he didn't call 911 because he was praying. The couple never considered taking the baby to the hospital, prosecutors said.

Shannon Hickman said that she must defer to her husband because of church rules. ‘I think it's God's will whatever happens,’ she testified.

The Followers of Christ church was founded in the 1890s in Kansas but moved to Oregon City in the 1940s.

The
devout followers firmly believe that the power of prayer and the laying
of hands - where ministers lay their hands on believers while 
praying - can cure illnesses.

It’s
thought that some followers secretly visit traditional doctors - but if
found out, they are likely to find themselves ostracised.

The
baby boy died quickly and there was no evidence that medical care would
have saved him, Mark Cogan, defending, told the court.

The Followers of Christ Church has a history of rejecting medical care for children and relying on as prayer and anointing the sick with oils.

Five other church members have been 
convicted in Clackamas County for crimes related to the rejection of 
medical care for their children.

The Hickmans' conviction on 
second-degree manslaughter charges typically requires a mandatory 
minimum sentence of six years in prison.

But many feared that, because of a religious exemption in 
state law at time of the crime, they might have received just 18 months 
in prison and a $250,000 fine.

In response to deaths among Followers of Christ members, state lawmakers removed the religious defences from criminal laws this year. 

Those exemptions had made it tougher to 
convict parents shunning a child's medical care for religious reasons 
instead of neglect.

The change will allow prosecutors to seek stiffer manslaughter or murder charges in faith-healing cases.

On Monday, Prosecutor Mike Regan said a message needed to be sent to the church that child abuse for any motive is still child abuse.

He said: 'These generally are good, decent, law-abiding folks, except in this one narrow area of their lives. One (area) where they have told us stubbornly – and arrogantly, if I may – that "We are not going to change."

'The law of civil society demands that they change. It demands that we sent a message to all of them that whether you believe this or not in Oregon, you cannot act upon that belief.'

Two other parents from the church were convicted earlier this year for failing to seek medical care for their infant daughter.

She had a growth that could have left her blind in one eye - and they were sentenced to three months in jail.
