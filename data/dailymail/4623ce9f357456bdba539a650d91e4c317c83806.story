A lunatic driver who uploaded a video of himself breaking a highly illegal record by driving 26.5 miles around Manhattan in just 24minutes and seven seconds before bragging how he couldn't be traced, has been arrested.

Officers swooped on the New York City home of Christopher Adam Tan in East Harlem yesterday and impounded a 2006 BMW Z4 he allegedly used to tear through the streets at breakneck speed in August this year.

Tan, who was charged with reckless driving and reckless endangerment, is believed to have uploaded hair-raising footage taken on a dashboard camera onto YouTube video, under the pseudonym, 'Afroduck'.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Smile! Christopher Adam Tang was arrested at his East Harlem home Thursday night

Arrest: A driver using pseudonym 'AfroDuck' who claims he drove 
around Manhattan in 24 minutes has been traced by police and ID'd as Tang

This 2006 BMW was impounded at the scene of Tang's arrest

When other YouTube users asked why Afroduck hadn't
 waited for a year so he couldn't be traced as previous 'record holders'
 had done, he said he couldn't be identified from the video and that 'records were meant to be broken'.

After news of the stunt made headlines earlier this week, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly declared war on Afroduck, and made it a priority to track him down.

The high-speed journey in a manual 2006
 BMW Z4, begins at FDR/East Side Drive at 116th Street, just outside of Harlem, with Tan weaving through traffic, undertaking moving cars at breakneck speed.

He then hurtles across the Williamsburg, 
Manhattan, and Brooklyn Bridges, before tearing through the Battery Park 
Tunnel and around the downtown tip of the island to beat an earlier 2010 record of 26 minutes, three seconds.

Held up: The driver says he stopped at six red lights in his manual 2006 BMW Z4 3.0SI

The illict racer dismissed claims he is a reckless driver, saying he was in control the whole time.

While some car enthusiasts on motoring blogs have praised the unknown driver, others say he sets a bad example for young drivers.

However the driver has dismissed claims he was reckless while averaging speeds of 66 miles an hour.

'Whether you're a good driver or not, 
when you're on the road, you have a high chance of getting hit by a 
drunk driver, being cut off, especially in New York,' he told Jalopnik.com.

'Being
 a good driver, you're more aware of what is around you.

'Being a fast 
driver doesn't mean that you're inherently a bad or reckless driver.

'Like
 I said before, I'm in control. That said, understand traffic patterns, 
understand what's around you and understand how others control or don't 
control their cars.'

Record-breaker: The driver raced around the eastern edge of Manhattan and looped around the island¿s southern tip

Dare-devil: The motorist weaved through traffic in the city's tunnel but miraculously avoided a collision

Footage of the journey, compressed into a six-minute clip, shows the driver zip through West Street/West Side Drive, which finally opens up in 
Midtown by all of Trump's buildings.

Heading north, he turns right by 
the George Washington Bridge in Washington Heights and gets across Manhattan at one of its narrowest points.

He turns back 
onto FDR/East Side Drive and races to the finish line, where he started the trip.

Sight-seeing: The driver was probably driving too fast to take in views of the Hudson River on the west side or the East River on the east side

New record? The driver claims to have completed his journey in 24 minutes and seven seconds - the fastest time ever

He said he prepared for the run by working out the traffic flows.

'Other than my car being stocked, I went out various times throughout the night to figure out the traffic patterns,' he told Jalopnik.com.

'I was always in control. In fact, this wasn't the first time I 
broke the record. I can do it consistently under 24 minutes and most 
likely beat my own record again.'

He also invited anyone to try and beat his record.

'Go ahead. Just watch out for the speeding tickets,' he said.

Illegal speed racer Alex Roy circled Manhattan in 27 minutes in 2001, reaching speeds of 144 miles an hour over the 24.48 mile distance. He never released the tape.

In 2010, another driver smashed that record with a time of 26 minutes, three seconds, released by Corporate Broadcasting Company.
