Ruling: Property investor Mark Howell, pictured outside London's Civil Appeal Court, has been refused permission to appeal his divorce

It was only a tiff about a woman’s ability to map-read.

But property investor Mark Howell’s ten-year marriage appears to have lost its way the day he argued with his wife over her navigational skills.

The couple took a wrong turn in France while driving along back-roads to Burgundy on a wine-tasting holiday.

Mr Howell stopped the car and clashed with his wife Nalini over her ability to plan the route.

And although the disagreement lasted only ‘a matter of moments’, it would later form a plank of Mrs Howell’s successful bid to divorce him.

Yesterday Mr Howell lost a costly legal battle against the decision to end the marriage – despite a judge admitting he had similar rows with his own wife.

London’s Civil Appeal Court heard that Mr Howell, 60, went on the French trip with Nalini, a 51-year-old company director, two summers ago.

Judge Michael Horowitz QC granted the couple a decree nisi in December – and revealed that he and his own wife also argued about map-reading.

But Mr Howell, of Kennington, South London, claimed the judge was wrong to accept his wife’s account that the map-reading clash was one of many.

He also maintained the marriage had not irretrievably broken down. So yesterday he asked another judge, Lord Justice Thorpe, to overturn the decision and give him the opportunity to breathe life into a marriage he insisted was not dead.

Although he admitted  having the row, he denied acting unreasonably and also objected to being ordered to pay his wife’s £20,000 legal bill.

He told the court: ‘There was nothing on which the judge could conclude that my wife could not be reasonably expected to live with me. I believe as I stand here that the marriage has not irretrievably broken down.

‘She said that there had been lots of 
arguments between us, but she never mentioned any arguments to the judge
when asked a direct question, apart from one about map reading on the 
way to a wine tasting in France.

‘I conceded that the argument about map reading had happened and the judge said he and his wife argued about map reading.’

Refusing Mr Howell permission to 
appeal, however, Lord Justice Thorpe said of the earlier hearing: ‘The 
conclusion of the judge was that the marriage had irretrievably broken 
down.

‘It is sad, as it seems to me, that 
this couple have spent far more energy and wasted far more money than 
was ever necessary had there been a more realistic assessment of where 
they stood and how to bring their failed marriage to an end.’

Mr Howell’s ex-wife was not at court yesterday and was not represented.
