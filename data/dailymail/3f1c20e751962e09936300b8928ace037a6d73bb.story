When Oscar Cotton was diagnosed with eye cancer, he faced a desperate race against time.

His parents had planned their wedding day - and they desperately wanted Oscar to see them get married.

He underwent gruelling chemotherapy treatment and although he lost the sight on one eye, surgeons managed to save the other.

This picture of Oscar Cotton was taken just before he was diagnosed, and you can see the unusual white shadow in his left eye, which is a symptom of an eye cancer called Retinoblastoma

Oscar's chemotherapy lasted several months and ended in January this year. Afterwards doctors confirmed he is blind in his left eye. But his right eye was fine

It meant that he was finally able to see his relieved parents tie the knot in an emotional ceremony.

His mother Emma, 31, said: ‘We were desperate to save Oscar’s sight and more than anything we wanted our son to see us getting married.

‘He was so brave throughout his treatment and we can’t thank the surgeons enough for saving his sight.’

Oscar was born healthy in July 2010, but when he was nine months old, Mrs Cotton noticed that his left eye was looking the wrong way. It corrected itself, but then it kept happening when Oscar was stressed or concentrating.

Mrs Cotton said: ‘I thought it was unusual, but it always corrected itself so we didn’t worry initially.’ 

At his 12 month check, the health visitor suggested Oscar might have a squint. She arranged an appointment with an optometrist. It was discovered that Oscar had a patch on his retina and he was referred to a specialist.

Oscar is still having regular check ups but is going from strength to strength, according to his proud mother Emma Cotton

Despite battling through chemotherapy, brave Oscar managed to attend the wedding of his parents, Emma and Nick Cotton in December, eight weeks after he had started treatment

Mrs Cotton said: ‘At home I researched ‘patch on retina’ on the internet.

One result mentioned retinoblastoma, cancer of the eyes. I told myself that it couldn’t possibly be that as it was incredibly rare.

But three weeks later doctors at Birmingham Children’s Hospital discovered that he did have retinoblastoma -  and he had tumours in both of his eyes.

Mrs Cotton, who lives with husband Nick, 31, a customer services representative for a mobile phone company, and their two other sons

Tyler, ten, and Zakk, four, in Stoke on Trent, said: ‘It was our worst nightmare. If it was just in one eye they would try and remove the eye, but as it was in both, they told us they would try and save the sight in both with chemotherapy.

‘He started treatment in September 2011. All his hair fell out and he’d wake up screaming in pain. It was terrible to watch him and I felt helpless that I couldn’t help him. But despite the side effects, he responded well, and he was so brave throughout it all.

‘A few weeks later we set a date for our wedding. We were desperate for Oscar to see us get married, but would the doctors be able to save his sight. We had to hope and pray that he could. I couldn’t bear the thought of my little boy not being able to see us get married.’

Despite battling through the chemotherapy treatment, brave Oscar managed to attend the wedding in December, eight weeks after he had started treatment.

Mrs Cotton said: ‘We had 30 guests at our wedding. But the most important person of all was Oscar. He matched his brothers in his tiny pinstripe suit,  and he watched us both say ‘I do.’ It was the most emotional day of our lives.

‘All the guests knew about Oscar’s battle. We were so proud of him. He was the bravest little pageboy we could have asked for.’

In January this year Oscar finished his chemotherapy. Afterwards doctors confirmed he is blind in his left eye. But his right eye was fine. The tumours were inactive. 

Mrs Cotton said: ‘We are thrilled he is doing so well. He still has regular check ups but he’s going from strength to strength, and we just can’t thank the doctors enough for saving his sight. Now we’re looking forward to Oscar seeing in our one year wedding anniversary with us.’
