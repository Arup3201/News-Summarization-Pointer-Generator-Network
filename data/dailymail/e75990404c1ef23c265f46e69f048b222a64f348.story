A new wandering wolf has been spotted in Oregon hot the paws of the famed OR-7, who fathered pups last summer.

The sighting, in woodland close to the rural community of Keno, confirms that wolves are now starting to repopulate the area after being wiped out completely in the mid-1940s through a centuries-long eradication campaign.

Biologists do not know the sex of the newly-sighted gray wolf but they can tell by the size of its body that it is an adult. 

New sighting: This January 5, 2015 remote camera photo shows a gray wolf west of Keno, Oregon

It was caught on an automatic wildlife camera on January 5 after tracks were discovered in the snow in December.

Commenting on the discovery, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist John Stephenson said: 'I am surprised to see another wolf unrelated to [OR-7's] rogue pack down in that area so soon. 

'It does suggest some sort of dispersal corridor [through which] they are making their way over to that part of the state. But we have no way of knowing. 

'We have a number of long-distance dispersers out there that aren't collared. 

'Even though it appears this one is staying in this area, I don't think we completely know it will stick in that area or keep moving around.'

OR-7 became famous around the world after his GPS tracking collar chronicled his travels once he left the Imnaha pack in northeastern Oregon in 2011.

He meandered across mountains, forests, deserts and highways to the southern Cascades, south into Northern California, and back again before finding a mate last winter and settling down on the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest and having a set of pups.

The newly-released blurry photo taken January 5 shows a gray wolf trotting down a gravel road past a stand of tall pine and fir trees.

Though it does not show the animal's head, it is clear from the body that it is an adult, Stephenson said. 

He adds that though it is gray, like OR-7, they know it is not him because his GPS tracking collar showed him far away at the time. 

Based on the photo, Oregon Fish and Wildlife would establish a new Area of Known Wolf Activity in the area next week, spokeswoman Michelle Dennehy said.

Wildlife agencies last week confirmed official pack status on OR-7, his mate and their pups.

Rob Klavins of the conservation group Oregon Wild said he hoped the state would get ahead of the curve and work to prevent conflicts between the wolves and livestock by working with ranchers to take non-lethal steps to protect their herds grazing in the area.

He cited U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics that about 1,000 cattle are lost each week in Oregon to weather, dogs, disease and other causes, while just five have been confirmed killed by wolves each of the last three years.

Hugh Charley, past president of the Jackson County Stockmen, grazes cattle each summer in the area west of Keno where the wolf was sighted. 

Oregon Fish and Wildlife informed him and other ranchers of the wolf sighting last weekend at the group's annual meeting. 

Though ranchers were not happy to learn another wolf moved into the area, Charley said he expected they would learn to live with them.

'It's not going to go away,' he said of wolves.

Extermination programs to accommodate the livestock industry drove wolves out of the west coast in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

However, the species has been steadily reintroduced since the 1990s.
