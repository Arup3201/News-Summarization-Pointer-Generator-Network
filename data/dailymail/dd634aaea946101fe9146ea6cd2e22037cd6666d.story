A trainee accountant has been caught selling fakes on Facebook under the name of his alter ego Rodney Trotter.

A covert sting operation was set up to catch Ryan Flood, after trading standards noticed his Facebook page, named after one of Only Fools and Horses'  Trotter brothers, was selling dodgy goods.

The 25-year-old, a talented table tennis who has competed internationally, was then caught offering £150 of counterfeits including a Rolex watch for £20 and DVDs.

Ryan Flood, a keen table tennis player who has competed internationally, admitted selling dodgy goods online under the name 'Rodney Trotter'

Flood, from South Wales, admitted 19 offences under the Trademarks Act and was given an eight month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months.

Justin Davies, prosecuting, said  officers had spotted the Facebook page selling the dodgy items as part of ongoing internet monitoring.

'It offered for sale what appeared to be designer products that cost significantly less than if genuine,' said Mr Davies.

A sting was set up and goods worth £150  were ordered through the Facebook page. They arranged to meet Flood on October 21 last year outside a Spar shop in Merthyr.

Flood disappeared around the corner before returning a few minutes later with the items. 

He told the officers that if they wanted any more then orders would have to be placed before a specific day because he would be playing football.

The real Rodney Trotter (Nicholas Lyndhurst), Del Boy (Sir David Jason) and Grandad (Lennard Pearce) in Only Fools and Horses always had a get rich quick scheme which usually backfired 

His home was raided at the beginning of December and a hoard of counterfeit goods were discovered. Flood claimed to be unaware that selling the goods was illegal.

Mr Davies told the court that had the 32 items found been genuine, they would have been valued at £151,146.95.

Wheeler dealer brothers Rodney and Del Boy Trotter always had a get rich quick scheme on the go in the BBC's comedy classic Only Fools and Horses.

They are convinced their dodgy goods and fake merchandise will one day make them millionaires, but, almost without fail, their plans backfire.

One of Del's dodgy schemes included the purchase of twenty-five briefcases that are locked with the slip of paper containing the combination lock number inside.

Another unsuccessful plan came when the brothers offer their chandelier cleaning service. But in one of the programme's most famous scenes, Grandad accidentally unscrews the wrong chandelier.

He added that no buyer would have been deceived into thinking a £60,000 Rolex watch was being sold for £20.

The court heard there had been a spike in the sales of counterfeit goods.

Andrew Davies, defending Flood, said buses had run from the area to the Bristol fruit market where dodgy goods were being openly bought and sold.

He said Flood, who first moved to Cardiff in August 2010 to study at Coleg Glan Hafren and train at the Welsh Institute of Sport, was a talented young man, both academically and in sport, having trained with the national table tennis squad with a view to competing in the Olympics.

Mr Davies said Flood, who has no previous convictions, was being backed by the Welsh Table Tennis Association to help him set up a local academy.

He said Flood, who has a daughter with his partner and is father to her older child, had also taken on the parenting of his partner's family following a death.

'At the time these offences were committed there were particular pressures on the family unit,' added Mr Davies.

Flood, from South Wales, admitted 19 offences under the Trademarks Act and was given an eight month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court

Sentencing Flood, Judge Richard Twomlow said: 'All the transactions happened away from the address, which suggests that you did not think that what you were doing was proper.

'All your customers knew very well they were buying counterfeit goods so nobody was being deceived.

'Having strayed from the proper path you seem to be back on it.'

Flood, who faces a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing next year, will have to pay a £100 victim surcharge.
