The head of of BBC TV has said he is prepared for BBC3 to lose viewers when it moves online in a bid to save £50million.

The corporation has earmarked the station for a move to its iPlayer service from 2015, which it says would save millions to reinvest in other programming.

If plans are approved, the channel will close and move completely online next autumn. 

But moves to effectively scrap the channel after 11 years has faced criticism from many of its stars, including Jack Whitehall, Dj Greg James and Richard Bacon, who started a Twitter protest to block the move.

Danny Cohen, head of BBC TV, has admitted he expects BBC3 will lose viewers when it moves online in a bid to save £50million

The majority of the new, smaller budget - 80 per cent - will be spent on traditional comedy and documentaries.

The remaining 20 per cent will be channeled into short films and digital media designed to draw in young viewers from sites including Tumblr, YouTube and Twitter.

It will also allow the corporation to launch a BBC1 +1 channel and show two hours more of CBBC a night.

BBC Director of Television Danny Cohen did not go into detail about which programmes would survive the move but the emphasis on comedy and documentary it could signal the end for entertainment shows including Don't Tell The Bride and Snow, Sex And Suspicious Parents.

Mr Cohen told reporters: 'We expect an initial drop overall and that's why we want BBC1 and BBC2 to pick up the weight. It's also why we see this as a package in our proposal to the trust for a BBC1 +1, because we know those +1 channels are very important to people.'

Mr Cohen said the BBC, mainly based at Media City (pictured), needed 'to learn, fail, learn again, innovate and succeed' to cope with the changing landscape where more people watch TV on computers and phones

The decision to axe BBC3 – which is expected to save around £100million a year – must be approved by the corporation’s governing body before it can go ahead. 

In 2010, the BBC was forced to abandon plans to axe Radio 6Music after its stars organised a vocal public protest.

Mr Cohen said the BBC needed 'to learn, fail, learn again, innovate and succeed' to cope with the changing landscape where more people watch TV on computers and phones.

Damian Kavanagh, who is in charge of putting the plan together, said: 'This 80/20 mix would extend and enhance the BBC3 experience and be of the moment, giving audiences more.

'It's a radical change for a TV channel to propose committing such a significant amount of its budget to non-TV content but I believe this will lead to greater innovation and allow us to engage with audiences for longer and more depth than ever before.'

In recent years, the BBC has repeatedly come under fire for wasting money. The controversial IT project known as the Digital Media Initiative was axed by Lord Hall at a cost of £100million to the licence fee payer.

And the corporation was castigated by MPs after a report by the National Audit Office discovered it had handed out £369million in severance payments to its staff over eight years.

The decision to move the channel is a controversial one - about 187,000 people signed an online petition opposing the move less than a week after the decision was made public.

Jono Read, one of the organisers of a campaign to save the channel, said the announcement 'left a lot of questions still unanswered'.

He said: 'The BBC Trust claimed that BBC3 was both diverse and young, and reached this audience better than any other BBC channel. Now the BBC admits it will see a drop in these audiences when it moves online.

'Why allow this audience to move elsewhere, and what happens if there's a significant drop? Will the BBC have a Plan B?

'We know that not everyone can get television online because of issues with broadband provision, particularly in rural areas, and the BBC is launching a BBC1+1 for that very reason, but for young people it's made the decision to take that content off our screens altogether. This somewhat defies logic.'
