Nicolas Sarkozy was today bracing himself to be summoned by judges investigating a variety of fraud cases as his presidential immunity officially ends.

The prospect of France's former head of state facing criminal proceedings has already been raised by two examining judges.

A serving president cannot be prosecuted, but Sarkozy’s immunity ends at midnight tonight following his election defeat to Francois Hollande last month.

Casting a shadow: Now that former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is about to lose his legal immunity, he faces a string of fraud probes relating to his time in office

Sarkozy has already faced accusations that the office of French president – the second-most powerful executive position in the world – was bused to harbour a criminal and that he should have already waived his immunity while in office.

Judge Jean-Michel Gentil believes that Liliane Bettencourt, the L'Oreal cosmetics heiress and France's richest woman, may have illegally contributed two payments of 400,000 euros (£335,000) each to Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign.

Both were traced to Swiss accounts, and one was allegedly received by Sarkozy in person in Paris, in return for offering Mrs Bettencourt tax breaks once he came to power.

A prosecuting source close to the so-called 'Bettencourt Affair’ said: 'According to the French Constitution, Mr Sarkozy will be available for summons within a month of May 16.

Facing probe: Judges are keen to question Sarkozy about Liliane Bettencourt (pictured), the L'Oreal cosmetics heiress and France's richest woman, who may have illegally contributed 800,000 euros to his 2007 election campaign

'He will be called to explain his role in alleged illegal party funding within months and may be placed under investigation with a view to prosecution.'

Sarkozy's former treasurer, Eric 
Woerth, is just one of numerous close associates currently under 
judicial investigation in connection with the Bettencourt Affair.

Judge
Renaud Van Ruymbeke also 'urgently' needs to question Sarkozy about his
part in the so-called 'Karachi Affair’, which involves illegal arms 
sales to Pakistan and the murders of 11 French workers in a bomb attack.

Sarkozy
was the campaign spokesman for presidential candidate Edouard Balladur 
when kickbacks from Pakistanis were said to be secretly paying for his 
electoral campaign in 1995.

'Sarkozy will certainly have to answer to the Judge once he loses the presidency,' said another judicial source in Paris.

There is so much evidence being massed
against Sarkozy that Eva Joly, a former anti-terrorist judge who 
herself stood as Green party candidate for the presidency, said he 
should have waived his immunity from prosecution earlier.

Joly
said 'We now have proof' pointing towards the 'illicit financing of 
Nicolas Sarkozy's campaign in 2007' and that this was 'very serious for 
democracy’.

Segolene Royal,
who stood as Socialist candidate for president five years ago, 
suggested that the main reason Sarkozy had been desperate to remain in 
office was to 'avoid prosecution'.

Suspicions aroused: There are also compelling claims that Sarkozy may have received millions of pounds in illegal funding from the late Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi (right), meeting the ex-French President here in 2007

Precedent: Sarkozy will be particularly worried because Jacques Chirac (right), his conservative predecessor, received a two-year suspended prison sentence last December for misusing public funds

Sarkozy will be particularly worried because Jacques Chirac, his conservative predecessor, received a two-year suspended prison sentence last December for misusing public funds – making him the first former French in history to receive a criminal conviction.

There are also compelling claims that Sarkozy may have received millions of pounds in illegal funding from the late Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.

Suspicions were raised when Sarkozy invited the tyrannical dictator to Paris for a state visit within months of his election in 2007.

Sarkozy has regularly denied any wrong-doing, but has so far produced no evidence in response to any of the allegations. Sarkozy is now living in Paris with his third wife, the former supermodel Carla Bruni, and their baby daughter, Giulia.

The conservative politician is a trained lawyer and has opened a small office in the French capital, from where he is expected to work on his defence to all the allegations.

Slur: A new semi-fictional book written by a member of Nicolas Sarkozy's own party depicts him as a violent dictator

A controversial new book has portrayed Nicolas Sarkozy as a violent dictator who had sex with female politicians in his office at the Elysee Palace.

The thinly-veiled fictional account of his presidency written by a member of his own UMP political party is said to have sent shockwaves through his inner circle.

Author Marie-Celie Guillaume has insisted that although names and dates have been changed, all the events depicted are based on fact.

In one scene in her book, The Monarch, His Son, His Fiefdom, the character Rocky, who is said to be based on Sarkozy, is miming boxing moves in front of a mirror in his office when a young female MP enters.

Ms Guillaume, who claims the event actually happened, said the woman had come to ask him about funding for a museum project, but he replied by telling her he was feeling 'very hot'.

He is quoted as telling the MP: 'Look at the state I'm in. You can't leave me like this. Be nice. You can see I need relaxing. Come on, it's no big deal.'

The woman is then said to have 'obliged' Sarkozy with a 'little treat'.

But Ms Guillaume adds: 'The sexual exchange was very brief because the monarch was very busy.'

France's 20 Minutes news website said: 'The author has said publicly that this is a true story.'

Ms Guillaume was chief cabinet director to the head of Sarkozy's UMP party Patrick Devedjian, and is said to have turned against the president when he overlooked Mr Devedjian for a place in government.

Shockwaves: The novel claims Sarkozy had sex with female politicians in his office at the Elysee Palace, seen here on the day he took office from outgoing President Jacques Chirac in 2007

In an interview with France's Marianne magazine, Ms Guillaume insisted she was not seeking revenge on Sarkozy for betraying her former boss.

She said: 'I wrote it because I needed an outlet. 

'These are the kinds of things that go on in the corridors of power. Everything I have written about is based on fact.'

Asked which character most embodied the 'political violence'  portrayed in the book, she added: 'Rocky, and his violence is all the more shocking because he is the monarch and the person who is supposed to unite and pacify.'

But staunch Sarkozy ally Isabelle Balkany, the deputy mayor of the Paris suburb of Levallois, said: 'I find it astonishing that she dare write a pseudo-satirical and borderline slanderous book about elected officials from the community she works for.

'It is an outrage on every level.'
