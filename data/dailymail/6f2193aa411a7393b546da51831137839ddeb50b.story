Prime Minister David Cameron is often accused of being out of touch with the British public because of his privileged background.

So now Dee Kelly, aka White Dee from Benefits Street, says she can give disillusioned voters a voice - as she intends to run for parliament in the future.

The 43-year-old mother-of-two, who found fame thanks to reality TV, says she's always been passionate about politics.

'I have always been interested in politics, I'm interested in the country and the people of the country so it's something I may go into in a couple of years,' she said on today's This Morning.

Dee, from Birmingham, said she won't throw her hat into the political ring just yet as she wants to wait for a time when she will be voted for based on her policies and not her celebrity status.

She said: 'It's something I want to do because I'm passionate it about it and if my policies are good. I want to get in because of my policies, not because I'm topical.'

She told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden she would be a good candidate to represent constituents because she has the 'right ideas' and 'feel for what real people are like'.

Dee starred in Benefits Street in January 2014, filmed on James Turner Street in Birmingham. The fly-on-the-wall documentary followed her and her friends and neighbours as they lived their lives on benefits.

She went on to star in Celebrity Big Brother in the summer of 2014 alongside Lauren Goodger and Edele Lynch, where she was voted the fifth most popular housemate.

As a result of the fortune fame has brought her, she's been off benefits for a year.

But she said she still feels she suffers from the stigma of having relied on handouts.

She said: 'It's a touchy subject, I have always said you have people who are happy on benefits and that's why hard workers get annoyed but for others, it's not a choice, it's where they are at that particular time. 

'People still tell me to get a job.' 

Dee admitted despite now having an income, she's not sure what her job title is. 

After recently losing three stone, she currently has plans to release a fitness DVD.

She said losing weight has made her feel happier and healthier so she wants to share the secret to her success with others.

She said: 'I have always had low confidence, I come across as gobby but I'm a shy person and private person. 

'It's about having motivation to get off sofa and do things and I'm getting there now.

'For my children, it's nice for them to see their mum feeling better in themselves, then you can give more to your children.'

She admitted that her swift rise to fame has been 'surreal'. 

'I still describe life as unreal,' she said. 'I still walk the same streets, I have the same friends and my children are at same schools but I am stopped all the time, it's surreal. It takes me ages to do a supermarket shop as I'm always stopped and chat to people.'
