Every parent should be issued with a ten-point checklist of skills that their children must master before their first day at school, the head of Ofsted said yesterday.

Sir Michael Wilshaw warned that too 
many youngsters have been starting their education unable to use the 
toilet, follow simple instructions or even make themselves understood.

Launching Ofsted’s first report into early-years education, he said that while many parents ‘intuitively’ teach children vital skills, others fail to do so, condemning their offspring to struggle at school.

And he claimed that a list of ‘essential skills’ – such as sitting still, listening and understanding the words ‘no’ and ‘stop’ – would help parents ensure their children were equipped to start primary school classes.

He also demanded more places for two-year-olds at school-based nurseries, particularly for poorer youngsters, to help them catch up with their wealthier peers.

Addressing childcare professionals in London, Sir Michael revealed that across the country, only a third of youngsters from low-income backgrounds reach key development milestones by the age of five.

He said: ‘The poorest children are less likely to be able to follow instructions, make themselves understood or manage their own basic hygiene.

‘By age five, many children have started reading simple words, talking in sentences and can add single numbers. But far fewer of the poorest children can.’

Sir Michael went on to attack the ‘middle-class’ idea that structured learning is damaging for young children.

He criticised the ‘chattering classes’ who believe children should be free to enjoy themselves without being required to learn.

‘Let us not pander to those who think childhoods are being stolen,’ he said, adding: ‘It is a middle class prejudice for which some of the most disadvantaged pay the price.’

But early years consultant Nancy Stewart told Sir Michael: ‘There is a lot of evidence about what counts in children’s later success and it is not putting on your shoes and going to the toilet, or even being able to  recognise your name.

‘It is things like being confident, being curious and motivated.

'We need to be careful when we look at what are we saying are the essential things to be ready for school but also to be life-long learners.’
