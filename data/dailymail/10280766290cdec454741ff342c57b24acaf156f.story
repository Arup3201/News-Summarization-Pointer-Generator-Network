Tragedy: Nicholas Harrison-Longmate, 36, was found dead outside his ex-partner's home after drinking a bottle of vodka

A man found dead outside his ex-partner's home has been camping in the block of flats for weeks in a desperate bid to win her back.

Nicholas Harrison-Longmate had inundated former partner Kerry Buchanan with poems, letters, phone calls and text messages after she called time on their five-year romance.

When she refused to give in to his attempts to win her back, he began following her around and took to sleeping outside Ms Buchanans flat.

He spent nearly a month living there, sometimes on her 
neighbour’s balcony or in the corridor of the block of flats, a coroner in Reading, Berkshire said.

The 36-year-old's campaign ended tragically when he was found outside her Reading home following a heavy drinking session.

Mr Harrison-Longmate has been following Ms Buchanan as she shopped at her local Tesco supermarket and was
regularly spotted drinking beer and bottles of vodka as he lurked 
around her block of flats in the weeks prior to his death.

The
6ft 4in Manchester United fan was described by his family as 'a gentle 
giant' who was simply 'trying to rekindle a lost love.'

The inquest into his death was told that Mr Harrison-Longmate had drunk excessively after the relationship ended and had downed a one litre bottle of vodka on the day of his death this summer.

He
sent a series of alarming text messages to Ms Buchanan where he indicated 
that he wished to take his own life, some of which were read out during 
the inquest on Tuesday.

One response sent by Kerry a month before his death, read: ‘I’m sorry but it’s over. Please let me get on with my life.’

Mr Harrison-Longmate was found outside his former girlfriend’s home in Reading, Berkshire on July 29 this year. Paramedics were called but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Detective James Faulkner of Thames Valley Police, confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.

Recording
a verdict of misadventure, Mr Bedford said he could not be sure Mr 
Harrison-Longmate intended to take his own life using alcohol, but noted
the ‘tragic circumstances’.

Mr Harrison-Longmate’s family was 
present at the inquest with his mother Susan, 56, releasing a family 
statement which described him as a thoughtful man with a big heart.

‘Nick never meant any harm to anyone. He was a gentle sort, with a huge grin and abundant generosity of heart and assets.

‘A big heart, kind, thoughtful, loving son, brother and grandson.'

Broken heart: Mr Harrison-Longmate was desperate to win his ex-girlfriend back and after trying to contact her through letters and phone calls he began following her and sleeping outside her Reading home

The statement read: ‘He never settled in one place for long, either moved job or house, never settling until he met his last girlfriend.

‘He died trying to re-kindle a lost love. He had become besotted with his ex-girlfriend and wanted to marry and start a family.

‘Sadly, this never happened and he leaves a heartbroken family to struggle with this tragic loss. We knew he found happiness, until recently and now hope he has found peace.

- Family statement

‘Nick’s long term girlfriend ended their relationship of five years a short while before his death.

‘He felt utterly betrayed and couldn’t understand, nor accept, this had happened.

‘He never came to terms with this rejection and quickly spiralled downhill to the point where he just sat outside her flat.

‘He did just that on Sunday, 29 July 2012, complete with vodka and energy drinks - and that is where he died.

‘I do not think he set out to end his life that day. His rucksack contained a clean change of clothes, a few snacks and his deodorant and toothbrush.

‘I just think it all became just too much to bear that day.’

A post-mortem examination concluded Mr Harrison-Longmate died from ‘acute alcohol toxicity.’

The inquest was told his liver showed a history of chronic alcoholism, and the toxicity levels in his blood showed 352mg per 100ml of blood - more than four times the drink drive limit.

The report concluded that the results show that Mr Harrison-Longmate consumed a very large amount of alcohol prior to his death, adding that more than 300mg could cause loss of consciousness or coma and up to 400mg is lethal.
