The family of a lottery winner who was poisoned with cyanide the day after he collected his $1million jackpot are at war with his widow amid claims she tried to cash the winning check in the days after his death.

Urooj Khan's brother, ImTiaz Khan, has alleged that Shabana Ansari attempted to claim the windfall 'shortly' after Urooj's death but was unable to do so.

ImTiaz Khan also claimed that his late brother and Shabana were not even married, meaning that she could miss out on half of the lottery prize to which she is entitled.

In another sign the family are tearing themselves apart, Urooj's sister Meraj Khan has launched aÂ  legal bid to take guardianship of his daughter Jasmeen from his first marriage.

Meraj wants custody of the 17-year-old even though she appears to have lived with step-mother Shabana at her home in Chicago for most of her life.

Miss Ansari's lawyer told MailOnline that his client had been questioned for four hours by police and had 'nothing to hide'.

The developments come as the Cook County Medical Examiner is expected to seek a court order to exhume Urooj's body later this week.

Family members told MailOnline that they do not wish to see the body if it goes ahead because it will be too traumatizing.

It is a tragic turn of events from July 19 last year when a delighted Urooj, 46, collected the over-sized cheque from Illinois State Lottery officials at the 7-Eleven where he bought the winning scratchcard.

Mr Urooj's 32-year-old wife Shabana, who moved to the U.S. after marrying him 12 years ago, is pictured at the event.

She can be seen wearing a green traditional Indian dress with a scarlet scarf. Her step-daughter Jasmeen stands beside her wearing a grey sari.

Urooj is seen smiling widely and told the TV cameras he was going to use the money to pay bills, donate to St Jude's Children's Hospital in Chicago and grow his dry-cleaning business.

After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 as he opted to take in a lump sum.

The day after receiving his winning cheque, Urooj came home from work and ate a traditional Indian Kofta curry that his wife had prepared.

He died a short time later. The initial examination by the Cook County Medical examiner found he had died of heart disease or natural causes.

After his death, the winning check was eventually cashed on August 15. However, in probate documents filed with the Cook County Court, ImTiaz Khan suggested that Shabana  had tried to do so before.

In a September filing, ImTiaz writes: 'Ms Shabana Ansari is in possession of the lottery cheque and is concerned she may attempt to cash the cheque again, as she did shortly after the decedent's (Urooj) death, even though the estate is entitled to the funds'.

ImTiaz also alleges that his brother's 'only known heir is his daughter Jasmeen Khan' and pointedly states that Shabana is not her biological mother.

He says he wants her to get her 'fair share' and alleges 'there remains question as to whether (Urooj) was married to Ms Ansari' .

His filing reads: '(ImTaiz's) counsel was informed by Citibank that (Urooj's) spouse, Ms Shabana Ansari, has been in communication with the bank and believes Ms Ansari may be attempting to control (Urooj's) accounts.'

The papers also state: 'Meraj Khan, (Urooj's) sister, filed a petition for Guardian of the minor (Jasmeen) on September 19, 2012.'

The day after receiving a check for his winnings, Khan awoke screaming in pain in his bed at his Chicago home (pictured). An expert said this is caused when muscle contract suddenly as the poison kills you 'cell by cell'

As a result of the filings last year, the jackpot was frozen and will remain so for the next three months.

In response, Ms Ansari filed documents of her own which stated she was indeed married to Urooj and the court agreed, making her the administrator of the estate.

The remaining three months will allow family members to make their case to the lawyer organizing how funds will be handed out. In normal circumstances, 50 per cent goes to the spouse and 50 per cent to the children, unless there are grounds for complaint.

In one sense Urooj, who emigrated from India in the 1980s, should not even have been gambling in the first place because of his Islamic faith.

He had recently returned to Chicago from the Hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, inspired to lead a better life and had sworn off buying lottery tickets - except just this once.

His death would have gone unnoticed as the first toxicology report said Mr Khan died of heart disease.

However two months later, a relative called the medical examiner demanding a fresh inquiry into the poisoning as he 'didn't accept it was going to be a natural death', MailOnline earlier revealed.

During the dramatic phone call, the family member flatly rejected the original ruling and ordered investigators to have another look.

A second, more thorough toxicology report turned up the cyanide poisoning as cause of death.

Deborah Blum, a poison expert whose book The Poisoner's Handbook is being made into a PBS TV series, said that Urooj would have been in 'absolute agony' after eating the cyanide.

Ms Blum, a former chemist, said: 'A good lethal dose of cyanide will kill you in ten minutes. A mid-range dose and people die within the hour. For a poison that's pretty fast.

'Cyanide poisoning is a nasty death. There is an enzyme which allows your cells to breathe and the cyanide wipes that enzyme out.

'It suffocates you cell by cell. Symptoms include seizures, extreme shortness of breath and usually cardiac arrest.'

In her latest interview, Miss Ansari told the Chicago Sun-Times that she hopes 'God will reveal the truth'.

She has previously paid tribute to her husband as a 'workaholic' and vowed to keep his laundry business open to honor his memory.
