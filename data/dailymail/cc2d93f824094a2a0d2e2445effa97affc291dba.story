A Government website has beaten The Shard and the 2012 Olympic Cauldron to be named the world’s best design.

Gov.uk saw off nearly 100 competitors in the Design Museum’s Design of the Year 2013.

The basic-looking site features links to pages such as ‘Housing and local services’, ‘Driving and transport’ and ‘Inside Government’.

Surprise: A Government website has beaten The Shard and the 2012 Olympic Cauldron to be named the world's best design

It has only two small pictures – of the Cabinet Office and of a couple outside a house to promote an energy scheme.

The site promised to save the public £50million by bringing together all Government departments in one place. It was described as ‘well thought out yet understated’ by the judging panel and – in a reference to fashion – ‘the Paul Smith of websites’ by museum director Deyan Sudjic.

‘Gov.uk looks elegant and subtly British thanks to a revised version of a classic typeface, designed by Margaret Calvert back in the 1960s,’ Mr Sudjic gushed.

The font used on the site is Gill Sans - the same as that used on Keep Calm And Carry On merchandise.

Winner: Gov.uk saw off nearly 100 competitors in the Design Museum's Design of the Year 2013, including The Shard, pictured

Winners in seven categories - architecture, digital, fashion, furniture, graphics, product and transport - were shortlisted for the award.

The website, which won the digital section, was chosen over the six other category winners, which included a modernised Parisian tower block in the architecture section and the Morph folding wheel for wheelchairs in the transport section.

Television presenter and member of the judging panel Griff Rhys Jones said the Gov.uk site was ‘a clear winner’.

He added: ‘It’s a vote of confidence in the idea that the Government can lead the way with simple and clever design.’

Prime Minister David Cameron claimed the win was ‘another example of Britain’s world class design talent standing out on the global stage’.

Gov.uk was designed by the Government Digital Service and launched in autumn 2012.

It has promised to save the public £50million by bringing together all Government departments in one place.

Internet users can perform basic tasks like renewing car tax or checking the balance of a student loan from the site, as well as accessing information on everything from income tax to claiming benefits.

But many more complicated problems must be dealt with by phone and some services need password access.

The Designs of the Year awards, now in its sixth year, aims to celebrate ‘the most original and exciting designs, prototypes and designers in the world today’.

Previous overall winners have included the London 2012 Olympic torch and the ‘Hope’ poster designed by Shepard Fairey for Barack Obama’s election campaign.

Success: The website also beat off stiff competition from the 2012 Olympic Cauldron
