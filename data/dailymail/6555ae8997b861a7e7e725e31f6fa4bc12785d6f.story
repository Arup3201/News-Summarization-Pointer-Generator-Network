He always wears whites, is fast approaching a century and was even known in his youth to bowl the odd maiden over.

But Pope Francis’ latest initiative could still leave some Vatican insiders stumped - the independent state is to field, for the first time, an international cricket team.

Catholic priests will bat and bowl against players of various religions including Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs, Vatican Radio said.

The Pontifical Council for Culture is also looking for cricket-playing nuns to form a women's team, it said.

'Going in to bat and bowl for the Vatican team will be mainly priests and seminarians who played cricket back in their home countries and are keen to keep their eye on the ball during their time here in Rome,' the official broadcaster to the Pope said.

'The organisers foresee some interesting ecumenical and interfaith prospects for the club and they are also on the lookout for any religious sisters interested in forming a women's XI as well.’

The idea for the team came from the Australian ambassador to the Holy See, John McCarthy, a former member of the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust.

The team will be formally announced on October 22.

The part time players will not be the only national squad. Pope John Paul II established a Vatican sports department in the year 2000, with the aim of 'reinvigorating the tradition (of sport) within the Christian community'.

The state has a national football team but they have only ever played three matches, a draw and two defeats against Monaco.

Pope Francis is a card-carrying supporter of his hometown Buenos Aires soccer team, San Lorenzo.
