Google’s attempts to put driverless cars on the road may have suffered a setback due to new motoring laws in California.

Under the rules all drivers must be able to take ‘immediate physical control’ of a vehicle for it to be able to travel on roads in the US state.

The law comes into effect on September 16 meaning that Google will either have to get it changed or convince legislators it is complying with its futuristic vehicles.

U-turn? Under the rules all drivers must be able to take ‘immediate physical control’ of a vehicle for it to be able to travel on roads in the US state. But the tech giant has created a car with no steering wheel or pedals which will be completely autonomous and rely on GPS technology, cameras and in-built maps of cities to steer it

That will be tricky as the tech giant has created a car with no steering wheel or pedals which will be completely autonomous and rely on GPS technology, cameras and in-built maps of cities to steer it around.

It wants to debut the two-seater vehicle in California where driverless cars are legal - but now lawmakers appear to have done a partial U-turn.

Google has not revealed how it will comply with the regulations as its prototype driverless car only has buttons for start, pull over and emergency stop.

There is also a computer screen showing your route on the vehicle, which Google hopes to have on the streets by 2017.

Testing on private roads has is due to start next month and will include temporary manual controls.

A Google spokesman said that the new California driving rules covered testing of its cars only.

He said: 'During our testing we are equipping the vehicles with manual controls such as a steering wheel, brake pedal, and accelerator pedal. 

'With these additions, our safety drivers can test the self-driving features, while having the ability to take control of the vehicle if necessary.'

However that is not the only hurdle that the cars have to overcome.

Another issue is liability for insurance companies in the event of an accident - experts have asked who will be responsible if there is no driver and Google is effectively in charge of the vehicle.

To get round this California has insisted that anyone testing a driverless car must have a $5 million insurance policy to cover any eventualities.

In the US driverless cars are only allowed on roads in certain states if someone sits in the driver's seat.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as September.

Changes to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic, which dates back to 1968, are also afoot.

It used to state: 'Every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.'An amendment agreed in May would allow a car to drive itself, as long as the system 'can be overridden or switched off by the driver'.

A driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time.

The convention covers European countries, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Russia, although not the United States, Japan or China.

Google has developed a
 digital simulation that its cars can drive around in (3D mapping 
software of the cars shown) and test their abilities before they head 
out into the real world. Google has not revealed how it will comply with regulations as its prototype driverless car only has buttons for start, pull over and emergency stop

David Hall, the chief executive of Velodyne Inc, which makes laser technology used by Google's autonomous cars, told the Wall St Journal that these questions left him concerned.

He said: ‘Who pays when there's a crash? Who will insure us against this?’

Google’s car is powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles before charging.

Its shape suggests a rounded-out Volkswagen Beetle - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face.  

The prototype two-seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive.

The car makes turns and react to other vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do, and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read in real time what other objects are actually doing.

The route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to Chris Urmson, the leader of Google's self-driving car team.

The car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles (160 km) before charging.

The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians.

In these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph (40 km/h) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles.

Ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service.Driving works by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map.

A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights.

Google has suffered other setbacks with its driverless cars after critics pointed out they will be able to exceed the speed limit.

Cyber security experts also warned that they could be vulnerable to hacking because they will use wireless technology.
