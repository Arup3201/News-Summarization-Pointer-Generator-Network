A meningitis outbreak at Princeton University last month prompted health officials to provide students with an unapproved vaccine to protect against the rare strain of the disease, and now parents at a university on the other side of the country - where there is a similar outbreak - are asking why their kids haven't been given the same vaccine.

The strain of meningitis that hit Princeton is meningococcal type B. So far, eight students have been diagnosed with the dangerous disease at the Ivy League school.

At University of California Santa Barbara, four students have been infected, including one who had to have his feet amputated.

Vaccine: An unapproved meningitis vaccine was given to Princeton students to protect against an outbreak of the deadly diseas

University of California freshmen Aaron Loy, 18, has had his feet amputated after being sickened in a meningitis outbreak at UC Santa Barbara

There currently is no vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for that particular strain of meningitis in the U.S. But there is in Europe, Australia and Canada. So health officials approved the import of the vaccine for Princeton students.

UC Santa Barbara students didn't get the same approval.

'I'm very concerned and upset about [Centers for Disease Control's] response,' Jeff Klonoff, who has two children who attend UC Santa Barbara, told 
ABC News. 'In UCSB, there has been four [infections] in the last month. 
If there's an explanation for why they're treating them differently, 
they haven't conveyed that.'

Outbreak: Since March, eight students at Princeton University have been diagnosed with the rare disease

Health officials say that they tend to only consider vaccination when there is an ongoing threat that people will catch a particular disease.

'We consider vaccinating when there's a sustained outbreak and ongoing 
transmission, and it looks like there's a continuing risk for the 
students,' said Dr. Thomas Clark, chief of the meningitis branch at the 
CDC. 'If you look back at the meningitis [strain B] outbreaks we've 
seen, out of the 13 we looked at, 11 [outbreaks] were four cases or 
fewer.'

Additionally, Clark said that the CDC needs to make sure that the vaccine would even work against the strain of the disease at UC Santa Barbara, since it's unclear whether the two strains are identical - while the diseases are similar, they might have different 'genetic fingerprints.'

At UC Santa Barbara, there have been four cases of meningitis, including one student who had to have his feet amputated

'All the data so far suggests that [the imported vaccine] would work against this strain, but then we [need to] test this actual bacteria that caused the cases,' said Clark.Clark said the CDC would continue to monitor the situation. If the situation worsens, he said, health officials would consider approving the vaccine for UC Santa Barbara students.
