Lotus owner Gerard Lopez has urged Renault to name names in future the next time they attempt to drop teams in trouble.

Renault Sport F1 president and managing director Jean-Michel Jalinier revealed last week at least one team had not paid their bill with regard to their supply of this season's power units.

Jalinier admitted the late payments were 'a serious concern' and that the critical point was 'just weeks away'.

Let's be clear! Lotus owner Gerard Lopez insists they've paid Renault for this season's power supply

With four teams as Renault customers - Red Bull, Toro Rosso, Lotus and Caterham - the belief at the time was that Jalinier could not be referring to the former two marques, given their resources in being backed by energy drinks billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz.

The obvious deduction was Jalinier was pointing an accusing finger at Lotus and Caterham, both of whom are reputed to be struggling financially.

Caterham team principal Cyril Abiteboul insisted his marque had paid up, leaving only Lotus as the sole team under suspicion.

Following Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, Lopez was seen engaged in talks with Renault bosses in his team's motorhome at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona.

Seemingly to clear the air, Lopez said: 'This is why we had a meeting, because I wanted them to clarify their price.

'I said to them if they are going to say things, then name the team that is an issue.

'Don't just say 'teams' and then expect people to make their own judgements. We respect the arrangements we have with them.

'If there is (somebody who has not paid), it must be somebody else, but I'm not even sure there is, to be honest with you, so we'll see.'

Asked directly whether Lotus had paid up, Lopez replied: 'We've paid up. We're absolutely in line with them.'

The situation, however, did not detract from Lotus' best result of a previously troubled season as the Enstone-based marque scored points for the first time this campaign.

From a season-high fifth on the grid, Romain Grosjean finished eighth, dropping three places according to Lopez due to an electronic issue with the power unit for a couple of laps.

Lopez had previously insisted Spain would effectively be the start of his team's season, and so it proved, and now he has high hopes.

'We've been saying from the beginning of the season we have a really good car, but it's been tough because of the foundations we had,' he said.

'In theory, we have a car that is behind Mercedes - well, everyone is behind Mercedes! - but closer to Red Bull, and then able to fight and beat pretty much any other car.

'This is one more step of confirmation, but only that, so we need to keep on pushing and working.

'But I think we will now have a normal season, which for us is being able to fight for being the third, fourth team (in the constructors' championship).'
