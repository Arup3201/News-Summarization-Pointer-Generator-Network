Everton have a great reputation for bringing through talented youngsters and will once again give youth a chance in Thursday night's Europa League encounter against Krasnodar.

Having safely progressed to the knock-out stages as Group H winners already, Blues boss Roberto Martinez is using the clash as a chance to experiment with his squad.

With talent such as boyhood Evertonians Wayne Rooney and Ross Barkley coming through the Goodison Park ranks over the last decade, Martinez is excited to show off the lastest 'diamonds' unearthed by the club.

The Spaniard hasn't been afraid to call on players from the Everton academy during his 18 months on Merseyside and the game with Krasnodar, who have already been eliminated, is the perfect opportunity to give some of the club's youngsters a taste of competitive football on the European stage.

After breezing through what was a tough group on paper - Everton did the double over Bundesliga high-flyers Wolfsburg and scored three without reply against Ligue 1 side Lille - Martinez is keen to enjoy the final fixture before the competition gets serious once more. For the first time ever, this term's Europa League winners will secure a place in next season's Champions League.

Speaking on Wednesday, the Everton boss said of Thursday's dead-rubber match: 'I think it should be a celebration. We have one game to go, we have had an exciting time in Europe and it is ideal for us to experiment.

'We are going to have a couple of our youngsters which is really, really exciting. We want to show a few diamonds of our development system. It is a really exciting game for us.'

One of the jewels in  Everton's crown is 17-year-old Ryan Ledson of whom big things are expected.

The midfielder - who captained the England Under 17s to glory in the European Championships in May - made  the bench against Southampton last season and, just like with Rooney and Barkley before him, mentions of his name have been heard around Goodison Park long before his first-team debut. Tidy in possession, Ledson could be given the nod by Martinez to make his first competitive start for the club.

Whilst the Blues manager was coy about which youngsters would start he did reveal promising right back Tyias Browning and 21-year-old left back Luke Garbutt would feature.

Boasting arguably the Premier League's best and most attacking full back duo in Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman the Blues have two deputies in Browning and Garbutt who are more than capable of filling in when called upon. Both have already impressed during brief cameos this term and it's fair to say both have been thrown in the deep end by Martinez who is clearly confident in their ability.

Browning's two appearances this season have come at Anfield and Old Trafford while Garbutt gave a composed and assured performance in a backline which kept a clean sheet against Wolfsburg as Everton claimed a 2-0 victory in Germany last month. 

Relishing the chance to play under the floodlights at Goodison, both will be desperate to catch the eye and stake a further claim for more first-term action.

Martinez also revealed defender Antolin Alcaraz will play a part, as will 22-year-old forward Conor McAleny who has patiently waited for his second chance in the first-team after coming on as a substitute against Arsenal at the Emirates back in December 2011.

Jonjoe Kenny, a 17-year-old defender born a short walk away from Goodison Park, and 19-year-old forward Chris Long have also been mooted for a possible cameo. 

It's not just the Everton youngsters who will be looking to impress during Thursday night's 'experiment'. Steven Pienaar, Christian Atsu, goalkeeper Joel Robles, Bryan Oviedo and Arouna Kone were also mentioned alongside Browning and Garbutt as the seven who would feature for the Blues against Krasnodar.

Striker Kone - hoping to banish his injury hell after being sidelined with knee problems for the past 15 months - is desperate to impress the Toffees faithful after managing just five Premier League appearances without a goal to his name following his £6million move from Wigan in the summer of 2013.

‘If I did manage to score it would be fantastic,’ said the forward on Wednesday. ‘It would represent the beginning of a big comeback. I’ve got such a huge passion to get my first goal for Everton. It would be marvellous.’  

Meanwhile, midfielder Gareth Barry trained on Wednesday afternoon at the club's Finch Farm training complex and could be used by Martinez as a wise head in the middle of the park who can pass on his experience and know-how as the match progresses.

Another name who will have certainly had an affect on Everton's younger players - both on and off the pitch - is striker Samuel Eto'o.

One of the best strikers in world football during the mid-noughties, members of the Blues academy must pinch themselves every time they share a training pitch with a player they undoubtedly grew up watching and admiring.

Having won the Champions League with Barcelona and Inter Milan, Eto'o still shows glimpses of his world-class ability and the former Cameroon international's winning mentality certainly boosts the Everton squad in this competition. 

Having a player of Samuel Eto's calibre at the club will have a hugely positive affect on the Toffees' youngsters

After storming to the top of their group to secure qualification with a game to spare, the Toffees will be keen to go unbeaten and complete the round in style.

With a chance to shine on the main stage, Everton's talented crop of youngsters can learn so much in a competitive game without the added pressure of needing a result. It is the perfect chance for the Toffees manager to see what his players are made of in a game they can enjoy.

Martinez will be hoping Everton's mix of youth and experience can see his side sparkle on the road to Warsaw.
