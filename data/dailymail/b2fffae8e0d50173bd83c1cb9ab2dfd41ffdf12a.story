A maths teacher has been arrested for allegedly trafficking methamphetamine in what could be a real-life version of the hit TV series Breaking Bad.

Stephen Doran, 57, has been charged by police after he was found with a package believed to contain almost half a kilo of the drug which had been sent to his school in suburban Boston via the US Postal Service.

When he appeared in court, bald-headed Doran's lawyer said he has undergone months of chemotherapy for stage three cancer.

'His life was on the line - literally,' he said.

In court: Police said they caught math teacher Stephen Doran, 57, with almost half a kilo of methamphetamine

Accused: Doran is accused of having a large package of the drug sent to the school via the US Postal Service

Evidence: Police say they found more drugs, $10,000 in cash, digital scales and 'other items consistent with drug distribution' at Doran's home

The case bears a remarkable resemblance the plotline of award-winning TV series Breaking Bad, in which high school chemistry teacher Walter White begins producing and dealing meth after being diagnosed with cancer.

In the show, Mr White - played by actor Bryan Cranston - uses the money to pay for medical bills and support his family believing he has only months to live.

Police said Stephen Doran left Match Charter Middle School at around 12.30pm on Tuesday after receiving a large package.

When he was pulled over by state troopers they recovered two heat-sealed bags of a crystalline substance which analysts say is consistent with methamphetamine.

Police said they were acting on a tip-off and that the drugs had a street value of around $50,000.

A search of Doran's home revealed $10,000 in cash, a digital scale and 38 additional grams of a similar substance.

The Emmy award-winning TV series starring Bryan Cranston, revolves around the life of Walter White.

The middle-aged chemistry teacher had the chance to be a brilliant academic but chose instead to work in a high school.

At home he has wife who nags him constantly and a brother-in-law who works for the Drug Enforcement Agency and never ceases to let Walter know he is the alpha male of the family.

Then he is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer and everything changes.

Walter encounters an old pupil of his, Jesse Pinkman, who happens to be a local methamphetamine dealer.

Using his chemistry expertise, the pair set up as a producers and dealers of crystal meth.

Walter's purpose appears to be solely to earn money to pay for his escalating medical bills and create a nest egg for his family after his death.

But the change of career and the fear of his mortality also triggers much-deeper changes in this once placid character.

The fifth and final season of Breaking Bad will run in the US from August 11.

The teacher has been charged with drug trafficking and also violating the state's drug laws in a school zone.

Doran was ordered to remain on home confinement with a GPS device attached to him.

He is allowed to leave his house for medical appointments if he posts $10,000 bail.

If convicted he faces between eight and twenty years in prison.

A spokesman from Doran's school, Mike 
Larsson, told CBS television he had 'no knowledge, nor any reason to 
believe, that any staff, teachers, or students were involved in this 
matter or were in danger in any way'.

Doran had been a tutor at the school for nine months and his also believed to have studied at London's School of Economics.

He also served as a Democrat state representative for the 15th Middlesex House District between 1980 and 1994.

His contract at the school has been terminated and he is due to reappear in court on June 24.
