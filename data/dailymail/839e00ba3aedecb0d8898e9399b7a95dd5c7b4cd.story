Charter boat captain Jim Sharpe was on his dock in Summerland Key, Florida. last Friday when he noticed a brown pelican with its throat slit, making it almost impossible for it to swallow fish.

Each time the pelican tried to swallow, the ballyhoo would fall out of its large pouch and onto the ground.

'It looked like the pelican’s throat had been cut with a knife,' he told the Miami Herald.

Cruelty: Each time the pelican tried to swallow, the ballyhoo would fall out of its large pouch and onto the ground. After about the seventh attempt, Sharpe said, he put a cast net over the water bird and made a gruesome discovery

A 10-inch clean slit reached from the point of the bird’s beak, all the way back to the glottis.

'The windpipe was dangling from the bird’s neck, almost like it was breathing out of a snorkel,' Veterinarian Don Harris, director of the Avian & Exotic Animal Medical Center in Miami, told the Herald.

Several more brown pelicans have been turning up in the area with the same injury, and Maya Totman, director of the Florida Keys Wildlife Rescue, said she fears there’s a person or group of people out there doing this to innocent animals.

'We’ve seen a lot of ripped pouches, but never anything like this,' she said.

Clean cut: 'It looked like the pelican's throat had been cut with a knife' Sharpe said. And it was not just one clean slice, but two cuts about six inches apart, creating a large hole in the pouch

Rescuer: Captain Jim Sharpe of Sea Boots Charters on Summerland Key found this brown pelican on the dock with a large chunk of its pouch cut out, which prevents it from eating

It's not clear how the bird was maimed but it is possible that the bird was slashed from the inside.

Harris agreed that the cuts on the pelican brought in by Sharpe appeared to be intentional.

'I firmly believe it to be malicious,” he told the paper, even likening the lacerations to 'a Colombian necktie' — in reference to a method of murder that began during the Colombian civil war.

Totman said she found one dead pelican and four others with their throats slit on Cudjoe Key on Sunday.

'If we don’t catch them soon they are going to die from starvation a terrible death,' she said. 'This is so sad. So sad.'

Brown pelicans are a fixture at Florida marinas and other coastal areas. While they are delightful to many, Sharpe says they are not beloved by all fishermen.

'They can be aggravating and try to grab your fish if you are fishing out of a boat,' he said. 'But I can’t imagine anybody deliberately maiming them, even though they can be a nuisance.'

On Sunday, a fisherman reported seeing several live brown pelicans with their pouches cut near Venture Out resort on Cudjoe Key. It’s separated from Summerland Key by a bridge.

The brown pelican is federally protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. It’s also on Florida’s protected list as a species of special concern, the Herald reported.

'They can be aggravating and try to grab your fish if you are fishing out of a boat,' Harris said. 'But I can’t imagine anybody deliberately maiming them, even though they can be a nuisance.'

Gorwing: As many as nine pelicans have been spotted with intentional cuts to their pouches between Cudjoe Key and Summerland Key in just the past two weeks

This one will survive: The pelicans have been found by fishermen but she and some of her colleagues are now patrolling the nearby islands to try to spot more. Some of the birds have been observed with cuts to their pouches but have flown away
