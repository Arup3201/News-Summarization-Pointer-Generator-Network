Crackdown: Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was time to limit outside earnings for MPs who earn hundreds of thousands of pounds

MPs should be banned from earning hundreds of thousands of pounds in lucrative second jobs, Ed Miliband said today.

The Labour leader said there should be
a limit on the amounts politicians can earn from outside interests but 
faced claims he was using the issue to deflect attention from his 
failure to stand up to his union paymasters.

Mr Miliband sought to get back on the 
front foot after dire headlines over union dominance of the Labour 
party, using financial muscle to influence policy and candidate 
selection.

The row erupted over claims of 
criminal activity in the Labour safe seat of Falkirk, amid allegations 
that people were signed up as party members by Unite without their 
knowledge in order to secure the union’s preferred candidate in the 
seat.

In a speech in central London today, 
Mr Miliband sought to reclaim the initiative by condemning Unite’s 
activities in Falkirk as ‘a symbol of what is wrong with politics’.

He said: ‘That was a politics closed, a politics of the machine, a politics hated – and rightly so.’

In a much-hyped speech he said he 
would reform the system of affiliating union members to Labour, 
introduce a code of conduct for would-be election candidates and 
introduce open primary elections for Labour's next candidate for London 
Mayor.

But despite being heralded as the 
biggest challenge to the unions’ ties to Labour, the plans were warmly 
welcomed by the heads of some of Labour;s biggest trade union donors.

It also emerged that the man chosen to
lead reforms of party rules is Lord Collins, a former TGWU assistant 
general secretary who helped steer the union into a merger with Amicus 
to create Unite – the union accused of exerting excessive influence over
Labour.

In a surprise move Mr Miliband 
announced it was time to end MPs earning big money outside Parliament in
as lawyers or advising the corporate world.

He said it was wrong that sometimes MPs earn higher salaries from second jobs than as a Member of Parliament.

Picking a fight: Mr Miliband said he wanted to change Labour's relationship with the unions

Fightback: The Labour leader used the speech at The St Bride Foundation near Fleet Street to counter claims his party is in hoc to his union paymasters

Some
295 of the 650 MPs declared some form of income, and 20 made more money
outside Parliament than their MP's salary of £65,738.

The total declared by Conservative MPs came to £4.3 million and by Labour MPs £2.4 million.

The MPs to declare the most income included:

Gordon Brown (Lab) £1.37million

Stephen Phillips (Con) £740,000

Geoffrey Cox (Con) £417,000

Nicholas Soames (Con) £305,000

Sir Malcolm Rifkind (Con) £276,000

Alistair Darling (Lab) £263,000

John Redwood (Con) £238,000

Jack Straw (Lab) £183,000.

Latest figures show MPs earned 
£7million from outside jobs last year, including 20 who received more 
than the MPs' standard salary of £65,738.

Embarrassingly for Mr Miliband, one of
the most in demand was former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who 
declared earnings of £1.4million , although he insists he does not 
receive the income himself  but ‘all the money goes directly to charity 
or to fund charitable work by himself and his wife’ Sarah.

Mr Miliband said: 'The British people expect their MPs to be representing them and the country not anyone else.

'They understand that Members of 
Parliament need to keep connected to the world beyond Westminster and 
will always write articles and give speeches.

'But can it be right that the rules 
allow MPs to earn hundreds of thousands of pounds from private legal 
practice while they are supposed to be an MP? Or from outside 
corporations without any real form of regulation?

'We will change things in the next 
Parliament. That is why I believe that at the very least there should be
new limits on outside earnings, like they have in other countries. And 
new rules on conflict of interests too.'

He urged David Cameron and Nick Clegg to work with him to tackle the problem.

But in the Commons Mr Clegg rejected the idea as an attempt to distract attention from Labour's woes over union influence.

The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'I 
think that what is important is that it is done in the most transparent 
and accountable way possible.

'People do expect MPs to work for 
their constituents. That is what we are here for and that should remain 
the principle purpose of all MPs elected to this place.'

In what is billed as the most 
significant reform of his party for a generation, Mr Miliband said union
members will have to ‘opt in’ to hand over an annual £3 donation to 
Labour, which they currently pay automatically.

It has the potential to dramatically 
reduce the amount of money Labour receives via union membership, but 
would increase the number of fully paid-up Labour members.

Mr Miliband is desperate to regain 
credibility while police probe claims that members of the Unite union 
conspired to fix a Labour candidate selection in Falkirk.

Mixed messages: Last night Unite leader Len McCluskey denounced the 'opt-in' plans as 'unworkable' but today said he welcomed Mr Miliband;s reforms

In his speech, he called for a ‘new direction’ with the unions, even though aides conceded this may ‘take years’ to achieve.

Unite leader Len McCluskey last night denounced the ‘opt-in’ plan as ‘unworkable’.

But today the head of the union which has given £8.4million to Labour since Mr Miliband’s election in 2010.

But today Mr McCluskey said he was 
‘very comfortable’ with Mr Miliband's proposals, which he said could 
result in tens of thousands more union members joining Labour.

Conservative Party Chairman Grant 
Shapps said: ‘Nothing has changed.  Under Ed Miliband’s proposals, Len 
McCluskey would still bankroll the Labour Party, pick Labour’s 
candidates, and still elect Labour’s leader.

Backing: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he supported the plans to curb the influence of the unions

‘It’s still the same old Labour Party:
a weak leader in the pocket of the union bosses who’s unable to stand 
up for hardworking people.’

At present, three million workers, 
including shop staff, nurses and train drivers, automatically have the 
cash taken from their union subscriptions, because their unions are 
‘affiliated’ to Labour.

But the levy has long been the source 
of resentment for some rank-and-file members, many of whom want to 
belong to a union but may not support Labour.

Under Mr Miliband’s plan, members would have to ‘opt in’ to the levy instead of the status quo where they are told to ‘opt out’.

The plans received the support of 
former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, who admitted that he should 
have made the same reforms himself when he was leader from 1994-2007.

'I think this is a defining moment, and I think it's bold and it's strong. It's real leadership,' Mr Blair told Sky News.

'I think it's important not only in 
its own terms, because he's carrying through a process for reform in the
Labour Party that's long overdue.

'And, frankly, probably I should have 
done it when I was leader - but at the same time, what he is doing - and
I think this is also very important for the country - is that he's 
sending a very strong message to the country that in the end he'll do 
what's right for all the country and not simply for one section of it.

'This is big stuff and it takes a real act of leadership to do it.'

However it is unclear whether the plans would succeed in diluting union influence over Labour policy and elections.

Mr Miliband is also resisting calls to
change rules on electing a Labour leader – a process in which union 
members still have huge influence – or whether he will dilute their 
voting power at party conference, where the unions still enjoy a 50 per 
cent block vote.

Under Mr Miliband's plan, members would have to 'opt in' to the levy instead of the status quo where they are told to 'opt out'

It remains unclear how the opt-in plans can work without union cooperation because its officials would have to administer it.

But the move was hailed by Miliband 
allies last night as the most significant reform to Labour since the 
party moved to one member one vote 20 years ago.

But the plans are some way short of challenging Labour’s links to the unions.

If, as expected, the number of union 
members formally affiliated to the party via the levy drops 
dramatically, union bosses could actually enjoy more power over Labour 
unless the leadership and conference voting rules are changed.

If the unions keep their block vote they would be able to manipulate the party by influencing just a few thousand union members.

In a fresh blow, the Tories yesterday 
asked Scotland Yard to launch an investigation into Unite activities in 
two other seats, Lewisham Deptford and Ilford North.

The full extent of Unite’s influence 
over Labour was laid bare last night when a leaked document written by 
the union’s political secretary revealed that the union has privately 
boasted of changing Labour policies and dictated the subject of 
Parliamentary debates.
