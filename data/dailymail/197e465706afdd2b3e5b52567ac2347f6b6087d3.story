On what should be the happiest day of her career, Wimbledon winner Marion Bartoli has faced an online backlash with trolls branding her 'fat', 'manly' and an 'ugly b****'.

The vicious attacks took place after 28-year-old Bartoli scooped the woman's singles prize at today's Wimbledon final.

Online trolls took to Twitter to criticise her looks, saying that she did not deserve to win as she is too 'ugly'.

Winner: Bartoli was attacked by Trolls on Twitter criticising her looks and branding her 'manly'

Shock: The Frenchwoman has described the win as a childhood dream come true

One Twitter user said 'Bartoli didn't deserve to win because she is ugly'.

Another said: 'For the first time ever a man wins the women's Wimbledon final! Go team men. #balls'

And she was also told to: 'get a boob job with the money you won. ugly b***'(sic)

Radio commentator John Inverdale also caused outrage when
 he asked BBC Radio 5 Live listeners: 'Do you think Bartoli’s dad told 
her when she was little "You’re never going to be a looker? You’ll never
 be a Sharapova, so you have to be scrappy and fight."'

The BBC was forced to apologise after the remarks that were made live on air.

Inverdale later said: 'We poked fun, in a nice way, about how she looks ... but Marion Bartoli is an incredible role model.'

Second place: Sabine Lisicki was left devastated when she lost today's final, but Bartoli comforted her by saying she would have another go in the future

All smiles: Some Twitter users compared Bartoli's looks with those of her rival Sabine Lisicki

A BBC spokesman said: 'We accept that this remark was insensitive and for that we apologise.'

The Twitter attacks have prompted an outpouring of criticism online as with Bartoli supporters rush to her defence.

One said: 'Bartoli as the complete underdog has just won Wimbledon. WHY ARE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HER FACE AND BODY!!?!'

John Inverdale made a derogatory comment about the tennis champion

Another added: 'Sadly being an amazing athlete counts for nothing if you're a woman :('

Bartoli today defeated 
Sabine Lisicki, who had gained huge admiration for the way she beat last
 year's champion Serena Williams earlier in the tournament.

But she lost to 15th seed Bartoli 6-1, 6-4 after an hour and 21 minutes on Centre Court.

Bartoli had endured a difficult 2013 before this fortnight. She failed to pass the third round of any tournament and her coaching relationship with her father Walter came to an end.

She had also never won a major tournament before.

But she was a picture of delight this afternoon as she lifted the famous Venus Rosewater Dish on Centre Court after racing into the stands to hug Walter.

Bartoli reached the final here in 2007, but she seemed over-awed by the occasion at the beginning.

'Honestly I just can't believe it,' she said. As a little girl I dreamt about this moment for so long.

'I was there in 2007 and I missed out. I know how it feels Sabine, and I'm sure, believe me, you'll be there one more time, I have no doubt about it.

'When I started this campaign on Court 14, I think if you told me I'd be here in the final i wouldn't believe you. To hold the trophy is unthinkable.

'I'm just so happy to be holding this trophy. It's been my dream since i was six years old.'
