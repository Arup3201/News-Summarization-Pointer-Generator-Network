A fruit which originated in the Bolivian rainforest and is now grown in Australia is on sale on the UK high street for the first time.

Marks & Spencer has introduced the achacha, a small orange-coloured fruit in the same family as the mangosteen that has a melon-like taste and soft texture.

The retailer said the achacha can be eaten at room temperature, cold or even frozen and the skin can be turned into a ‘thirst-quenching’ drink.

Its nutrients include calcium and vitamin C and less sugar than many other fruits, M&S said.

The retailer said the farmer of the fruit grew up eating the achacha in Bolivia and, on moving to Australia, missed it so much that he spent four years cultivating it to be grown successfully and sustainably.

M&S fruit expert Shazad Rehman said: ‘We’re very excited to be introducing the achacha to the UK high street for the first time.

‘It’s delicious eaten on its own or great popped into a glass of fizz or a fruit salad at a dinner party - certainly a conversation starter.

‘We pride ourselves on innovation and being the first to bring new fruit and veg to the high street. We were the first to discover bubblegum plums, liquorice pears, tiny tangerines, giant strawberries and now the delightful Achacha. We’re already looking at what could be next.’

The Achacha costs £2.50 for a pack of four.
