Working class: John Major would front the campaign

An attempt to play down the Conservative Party’s ‘posh’ image backfired when a campaign to promote working-class Tory MPs found only 14 with sufficiently humble roots.

Panicking party chiefs have now launched a desperate search for more Conservative MPs who were not ‘born with silver spoons in their mouths’ – begging them to step forward to rescue the initiative.

David Cameron had hoped to launch the campaign, which features former Prime Minister John Major, the son of a circus performer, at the party conference in September.

But he has been forced to go back to the drawing board because the 14 ‘working-class Tories’ featured in the new ‘Party of Opportunity’ campaign represent fewer than one in 20 of its 305 MPs.

To add to the problems, other MPs have said that some of the ‘I’m a working-class Tory’ claims are ‘laughable’. And the organiser, David Amess, has faced a revolt by fellow MPs who have said that despite their genuinely modest backgrounds, they had been given no opportunity to take part.

In an email marked ‘strictly private and confidential’ he told them: ‘A number of colleagues have complained that they are working class and want to know why they were not included. I did my best to identify working-class Tories and I am sorry if you were left out. As a result we are producing a further edition. If you have working-class credentials and want to contribute, let me know.’

Mr Amess’s account of his own working-class roots states: ‘I was born in the East End of London. We had no bathroom, a tin bath used to hang on the wall outside, an outside toilet, and a scrubbing board, not a washing machine. We didn’t have a telephone, we just threw the window open and shouted loudly. So when I became Basildon MP I was completely at home with lots of Eastenders.’

High Peak MP Andrew Bingham wrote: ‘My grandfather was a chef who once made a cake for [Russian Communist leader] Nikita Khrushchev.’

Armed Forces Minister and Essex MP Mark Francois said: ‘Defence brought me into politics. I was fascinated by the Second World War and my bedroom was full of Airfix models and plastic soldiers.

‘I’ve always had contempt for champagne socialists racked by middle-class guilt who profess their love for working-class people but would scarcely dream of inviting them to dinner.’

Yorkshire Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke wrote: ‘Seeing people I went to school with who never bothered doing homework or paying any attention fail their exams and spend years living off the State shaped me.

‘I used to be up at 5am to do the papers in WH Smith before college, and got up at 4am to sweep a factory floor while doing my degree.’

Former miner, Transport Minister Patrick McLoughlin, and Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Sajid Javid, whose father came to Britain from Pakistan with £1 in his pocket, also feature in the campaign.

One Conservative MP told  The Mail on Sunday: ‘We are right to be proud of real working-class Tory heroes like Major, McLoughlin and Sajid.

‘But this campaign has been badly handled. With only 14 MPs, it has played into our opponents’ hands.

‘One or two of the stories sound like the Monty Python sketch where one Yorkshireman boasts about living in a shoe box in the middle of a road and another says he lived in a paper bag in a septic tank.’
