Tears filled the eyes of John Singleton as he stood on the first tee on Thursday, in front of friends, family and workmates from the nearby resin mixing factory that had been temporarily closed so they could follow the action.

Even
 the coach from his three years spent at American college in Illinois 
was there — Dave Smith having flown in at the last minute to watch his 
former pupil.

VIDEOVIDEO The Open: First Round highlights 

After the raucous reception for the man who drives forklift trucks at Advanced Electrical Varnishings came the nerves, as the dream for the local qualifier became reality.

He had to back off because someone sneezed and then, to the loudest cheer of the morning, he striped it long and straight down the middle of the fairway to get his unlikely appearance at a Major championship off to the perfect start.

Five hours later he was back after what he described as ‘the time of my life’, despite a six-over-par back nine having eroded an impressively solid start and seen him finish on 78.

Special: Singleton was followed by friends, family and workmates from the nearby resin mixing factory

His performance is likely to mean that it 
will all be over for Singleton by Saturday night and that a return to the day 
job beckons next week. But nothing could dilute his enthusiasm after his
 round, or that of his mates who had followed him round in the Hoylake 
sunshine.

‘It feels like I shot six
 under, it was something special I can keep for the rest of my life,’ he
 said. ‘I’m not some big-time Charlie who is going to win. I wanted to 
enjoy myself and soak it all in. My boss paid for all of my workmates 
who wanted to come. I had a beer with him last night and he told me he 
has never wanted anyone not to come back to work so much on a Monday.’

So
 informal was the atmosphere that Singleton’s friends scrounged some sun
 lotion from him on a day when the Wirral peninsula had a somewhat 
Mediterranean feel.

‘They told me to throw them some suncream,’ he 
revealed. ‘I said "I’m playing the Open", they said

'No, throw us some, 
we are burning”. They kept it as well!’

The start had provided a 
poignant Open moment. ‘I had tears in my eyes but I was more focused on 
my shaking hands,’ he said. ‘As it turns out, I hit one of the my 
best-ever shots under pressure.’

The front nine was a white knuckle ride as he clung on to level par. 

At
 times it was almost Ballesteros-like, as Singleton repeatedly got 
himself into trouble but then  rescued par, often through delicate chips
 from just off the green. Only when he double bogeyed on the twelfth by 
taking two to get out of the rough was he derailed, although he can 
always hold dear the knowledge that he was once ahead of Tiger Woods in 
the Open.

Singelton’s fiance Lucy Johnson is expecting their first 
child in six weeks and consequently restricted herself to watching him 
play only five holes.

Focused: Singleton enjoyed the experience despite dropping six shots on the back nine

It was she who encouraged him to try and enter
 the qualifying event at Hillside that led to Singleton swapping his 
forklift truck for the massive Hoylake galleries.

She said: ‘I was unbelievably proud of him on the first tee although I was a nervous wreck.

‘I kind of enjoyed it, I really enjoyed seeing him out there. I’m not a golf fan really, but I encouraged him to do this.

‘He
 felt like he had unfinished business in terms of his golf career. I 
know how committed he is and how driven he is and I wanted him to pursue
 it.

‘I think I’ll try not to do so much walking tomorrow but I’m 
looking forward to it, even if I’m putting myself through the ringer 
again.’
