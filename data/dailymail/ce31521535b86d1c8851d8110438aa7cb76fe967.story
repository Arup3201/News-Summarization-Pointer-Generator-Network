A paedophile suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann has been linked with attacks on another five British girls.

They include a ten-year-old who was sexually assaulted in Praia da Luz two years before three-year-old Madeleine vanished from the resort in the Algarve, British police revealed yesterday.

The attack took place in the ‘heart of the resort’ in 2005 but the victim, now thought to be 19, did not tell her parents at the time.

She only came forward following an appeal by Scotland Yard last month about a lone sex offender already thought to have targeted 12 British families holidaying in the region between 2004 and 2010.

Their apartments were broken into and five young girls were assaulted in their beds by a predator who police believe may be a local binman described as ‘smelly and pot-bellied’.

Since the appeal six other British families have come forward to report that their children aged six to 12 fell victim to the offender over the same period.

Five of those children – including the ten-year-old molested in Praia da Luz – were sexually assaulted and there was one ‘near miss’ when the intruder was disturbed in neighbouring resorts.

Police have received 500 calls about the mystery man said to have ‘a vile interest in young, white, female children’.

The latest development comes as police
 announced that they are about to begin ‘operational activity’ on the 
ground in Portugal, raising hopes that arrests could be imminent.

Detectives
 are preparing to fly out to Portugal in the next fortnight in a move 
which will coincide with the anniversary of Madeleine’s disappearance.

They
 hope to be able to arrest and quiz suspects but any formal interviews 
will be conducted by Portuguese police with Met officers sitting in.

After months of stalling, the Portuguese authorities are set to give the go-ahead by the end of the week on three letters of request from Scotland Yard which are thought to include the questioning and arrest of suspects.

Detectives hope the breakthrough will mean British and Portuguese officers can act within days.

Three incidents took place in Praia de Luz - between 2005 and 2010

Five incidents took place in Carvoeiro between 2004 and 2006

Nine incidents took place in the Praia de Gale, Vale de Parra, Sao Rafeal (Albuferia district) between 2004 and 2008

One incident took place in Vilamoura in 2005, a new offence which has come to light since the March appeal

But they have still to agree a timescale with the Portuguese authorities which have refused to mount a joint investigation with their British counterparts, preventing Scotland Yard detectives from carrying out their own activities in Portugal.

It emerged yesterday that the Portuguese have already snubbed a number of requests from Scotland Yard’s Operation Grange set up in 2011 to investigate the toddler’s disappearance.

One key thing detectives want to establish is if there are any local police files on the break-ins, now totalling 18, of British tourists’ apartments around the Algarve.

Astonishingly, local police knew about 14 of them at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance, but dismissed any link as they were spread over a wide area and there were no attempts to abduct the children targeted.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said the attack on the ten-year-old girl was particularly significant because it ‘now takes us into’ Praia da Luz.

Madeleine disappeared from her family’s holiday apartment on May 3, 2007, as her parents Kate and Gerry dined at a nearby restaurant.
