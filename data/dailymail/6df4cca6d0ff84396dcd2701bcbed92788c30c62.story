Factory workers in China assembling iPhones and iPads for Apple are working exhausting hours for low pay, a report commissioned by the computer giant has admitted.

The inquiry, set up by Apple after a series of suicides at its Chinese factories, revealed employees often worked more than 76 hours a week and 11 days in a row.

The investigation, which was run with America's Fair Labour Association, found 'significant' failings at three Chinese plants run by Foxconn, a major supplier for Apple which also makes half of the world's consumer electronics.

Critics have blamed a string of 
suicides and injuries on appalling conditions at the 'sweatshop 
factories', where 90 per cent of Apple's products are put together.

As a result of the report, Apple and 
Foxconn bosses have agreed to reduce working hours, improve health and 
safety conditions, and 'establish a genuine voice for the workers'.

Apple said in a statement: 'Empowering workers and helping them understand their rights is essential.'

The investigation found that within 
the past year, all three factories exceeded both the group's standard of
60 working hours a week and 36 hours maximum overtime a month. Some 
also exceeded the work week limit of 76 hours set by Chinese law.

It came as Apple chief Tim Cook paid a
visit to China. Vice premier Li Keqiang, who is likely to be the 
country's next leader, reportedly told Mr Cook that multinational 
companies should 'pay more attention to caring for workers'.

However, 
the report has not been favourably received by some of the factories' 
workers, many of whom are concerned that a cut in hours will mean much 
lower salaries.

One employee, a 23-year-old called Wu,
said: 'We are worried we'll have less money. If we work less overtime, 
it means less money.' Apple stocks fell slightly after the report's 
findings were unveiled.

Foxconn City is part of Taiwan's Hon 
Hai Precision Industry Company, which employs up to 1.1million in 
factory complexes in China.

The New York Times claimed in a recent
report that some workers making iPads and iPhones said they stand so 
long their legs swell until they can hardly walk.

Between 2009 and 2011, at least 19 
Foxconn staff were linked to suicides or attempted suicides. Foxconn – 
which also makes items for Sony, Nintendo and Hewlett Packard – disputed
claims of long shifts and crowded living conditions.
