A woman allegedly depicted in a pornographic video made at a university library is now trying to rally fraternity brothers to come to her defense.

Kendra Sunderland, 19, faces a potential jail sentence and fine if convicted of public indecency.

Court documents say, 'The defendant, on or about January 27, 2015, did and with the intent of arousing the sexual desire of defendant or another person, expose her genitals; contrary to statute and against the peace and dignity of the State of Oregon.'

The documents - obtained and published by the Smoking Gun - accused Sunderland of committing public indecency on the sixth floor of Valley Library at Oregon State University.

Video: Kendra Sunderland allegedly appeared in an explicit video filmed at an Oregon State University library

Legal issues: Sunderland is now facing a public indecency act over the video 

The video reportedly shows the 19-year-old performing a sex act and flashing the camera.

Sunderland, who attended OSU but dropped out, asked in a since-deleted Wednesday Facebook post for assistance from fraternity members.

The post read 'Dear Oregon State Frat Brothers I need your help, comment here and we will DM...and please no dumb replies, this is a serious issue regarding my court date tomorrow.'

She later lashed out on Facebook at the school's Interfraternity Council. 

Sunderland alleged 'The OSU Frat Council wants to take away people's right to protest [sic]. What do you think?'

Attached was a selfie showing her giving the camera the middle finger, as well as a link to an article on MStarz.

The article included a message allegedly written by OSU Interfraternity Council President Michael Conan to FriendFinder Networks CEO Ken Hawks, requesting that Hawks refrain from contacting OSU fraternity members to protest on Sunderland's behalf. Conan stated that fraternity chapters were warned of 'judicial ramifications' for their participation.

Conan declined to comment to Daily Mail Online, referring questions to OSU spokesman Steve Clark.

Clark said he was aware of Conan's reported remarks.

OSU's Interfraternity Council did not respond to a request for comment. 

Hawk said Conan sent him the text message on Tuesday at 12:02AM PST.

According to the Smoking Gun, Sunderland may be forced to pay a $6,250 fine and spend as much as one year in prison. Her arraignment is planned for Thursday, the website reported.  

An Oregon State Police log written by Trooper Christopher Graves said 'On January 27, 2015 at approximately 2:30pm I was tasked to looking into a complaint of a video of a female that was posted to a pornographic site claiming that the solo act that was being performed occured [sic] in the Oregon State University library. I was able to identify the suspect as the female [redacted]. The suspect was cited for Public Indecency [sic] and released.' 

The log was obtained and published by the Oregonian in January.   

New career: Sunderland began performing in webcam videos during a failed job search in Fall 2013 for a waitress position, when she was still a OSU student

Business venture: Sunderland is behind the website Date Broke College Girls and appears on the homepage

Daily Mail Online earlier reported that Sunderland is behind the website Date Broke College Girls.

'I created this site to match college girls like me who are struggling to pay for school and looking for a rich older boyfriend,' she wrote online. 'Hopefully this will keep them from getting naked in the library and help them use it to study!'

In early February, the New York Daily News reported that Sunderland began performing in webcam videos during a failed job search in Fall 2013 for a waitress position, when she was still a OSU student.

'Working a minimum wage job, there's people that are just mean to you when they're having a crappy day,' Sunderland told the newspaper. 'On MyFreeCams, [users] had nothing but nice things to say. And I made way more than I would working any other job.'

The New York Daily News reported that Sunderland made approximately $700 from filming the on-campus webcam video in October, before soon leaving school and making more videos.

Clark told the newspaper that Sunderland was banned from school grounds.

A MyFreeCams attorney also told the New York Daily News that Sunderland's video violated the guidelines for the website, and she is banned. 

Both the Benton County District Attorney's office and Sunderland did not respond to requests for comment. 

Sunderland's attorney, Michael Flinn, said Wednesday 'What I can tell you is this: We believe the charge should never have been filed, but we will appear in court tomorrow to start a vigorous defense against it.' 

A publicist for Sunderland said a comment would be made after the Thursday arraignment.
