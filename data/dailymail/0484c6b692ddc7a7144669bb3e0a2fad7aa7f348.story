It's the battle which could decide who becomes the third team to reach the World Cup semi-finals. But one Belgian newspaper has decided to take a light-hearted look at Vincent Kompany vs Lionel Messi.

Brussels based Het Laatste Nieuws opted to depict the pair dancing the tango on their front page on Saturday, just hours before Belgium clash with Argentina in Brasilia for a place in the last four.

Accompanied by the headline 'Tonight we dance the tango', the Manchester City defender and Barcelona forward get up close and personal in the mocked-up image - just like they will at the Estadio Nacional.

The same newspaper also reveal the result of their poll which asked who will win Saturday afternoon's huge quarter-final.

A massive 74 per cent of readers believe that their country will defeat Alejandro Sabella's side and set up a semi-final clash against the winner of Holland vs Costa Rica.

The confidence among the Belgian population can also be seen on the front cover of sports publication DH Les Sports, who go with the headline 'Messi, welcome to hell' and an image of the Argentina star being faced with Kompany, Thibaut Courtois and Daniel van Buyten in front of a fiery background.

Van Buyten is confident that his side will deal with the threat of Messi, who has already scored four goals during the tournament.

The Bayern Munich defender said of the 27-year-old: 'If he gets past one player, he will have to get past a second player, because another will help out. We will have to show our big heart.'
