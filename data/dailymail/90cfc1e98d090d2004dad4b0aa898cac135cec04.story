Labour was last night accused of attempting to hijack a petition calling for new laws to shackle the Press.

The petition, launched by the father of Madeleine McCann last week, urges the three party leaders to implement every word of Lord Justice Leveson’s 2,000-page report on press standards.

Set up by the Hacked Off protest group, it has been widely portrayed as non-partisan campaign.

But last night it emerged the Labour Party is using its own resources to mobilise support for the petition.

It hopes to force David Cameron to back down on his pledge to protect free speech by shunning Lord Leveson’s call for a state-backed regulator.

Today it emerged both the Prime Minister and Lord Justice Leveson have been called to give evidence to a powerful parliamentary committee on his plans for press regulation.

The Commons Culture, Media and Sports Committee has launched a new inquiry into press regulation, and hopes that the PM and the Appeal Court judge will be star witnesses.

Press Complaints Commission chairman Lord Hunt, Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger and representatives of the Hacked Off campaign have also been asked to give evidence.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller today pleaded for cross-party unity as MPs again clashed on the government’s response to the report.

Mr Cameron has made clear he opposes using the law to enforce regulation of the press, defying calls from Labour, Lib Dems and some of his own Tory MPs.

As the Commons began a debate on the judge’s report, Mrs Miller warned MPs: ‘We must not allow this debate to polarise us. We all agree on the need for a tough and independent regulator for the press ... we all agree that the suffering of the victims and their families cannot be allowed to happen again.

‘We all agree that the status quo is not an option. It is the responsibility of this House to ensure that whatever is put in place is effective.

‘This is common ground, let us put to one side the politics and let us turn our focus on the principles.’

But Labour’s deputy chairman Tom Watson has said the party would ‘bring to bear every resource’ on the issue.

Mr Cameron has grave concerns about state involvement in a regulator and believes the Press should be given the chance to face a tough new regime of independent regulation.

Yesterday it emerged that 2,000 editors are ready to sign up to independent regulation in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.

Lord Hunt, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, dismissed claims that legislation was needed to persuade publishers to join a tougher regulatory system.

The peer, who will take part in talks between the Prime Minister and newspaper editors tomorrow, said five-year rolling contracts would ensure publications could not ‘walk away’ from a new regime.

He said: ‘I have spoken to 120 publishers speaking on behalf of 2,000 editors. They have all told me they will sign up.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday urged his 177,000 Twitter followers to sign the petition.

Mr Watson has been authorised to use Labour’s databases to email all party members telling them to back the petition.

In an extraordinary message, he told them to persuade family and friends to sign up as well, in the hope of forcing the Prime Minister to reverse his ‘betrayal’.

Mr Watson went on: ‘We will bring to bear every resource, call in every promise, rattle every skeleton in every cupboard. This is a step too far by Cameron.’

Making it clear that he sees the petition as a means of launching a Labour Party onslaught on the Prime Minister, Mr Watson continued: ‘Cameron wants to sell out to Rupert Murdoch and powerful press interests because he is scared, and he is weak. But that is why he cannot succeed – because he is weak. And he is wrong.’

Yesterday Peter Preston, former Guardian
editor, weighed into the debate. He warned: ‘Of course, everyone has 
been very nice to Lord Justice Leveson. But, in truth, this report is a 
sloppy, elephantine piece of work that relies on nobody having the time 
to read it before taking sides.’

Tory MP Conor Burns said Labour had made a ‘fatal error of judgment’ in calling for the implementation of the report, which civil liberties campaigners have warned raises serious concerns.

Mr Burns, a member of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, added: ‘It is a huge but characteristic error of judgment on Tom Watson’s part to try and turn a legitimate debate on press regulation into a squalid partisan rant.’

All in law: The petition wants to implement every word of Lord Justice Leveson's 2,000 page report

Fellow Tory committee member Philip Davies said Labour’s involvement would raise questions about the campaign’s independence.

He said: ‘It rather undermines the impression that campaigners want to leave that this is a non-party political movement if Labour party members are being agitated to sign this.’

Hacked Off yesterday boasted that its online petition had been signed by more than 100,000 – although critics have questioned the thoroughness of checks to ensure all signatures are genuine. 

A similar petition on the Government’s website, where all names are checked, has been signed by fewer than 5,000.

Hacked Off insisted that the petition remained a ‘cross party’ campaign.

A spokesman said Mr Watson had acted ‘on his own initiative’.

Labour last night announced it will bring forward its own draft legislation before Christmas to implement Lord Leveson’s proposals, although it is backing away from Mr Miliband’s original insistence that the broadcasting regulator Ofcom should oversee a new system of regulation.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller has already ordered officials to draw up a draft Bill, but has warned it will ‘demonstrate our concerns’ that new laws could be amended by MPs to curb free speech.

Labour accused her of ‘bad faith’ and said its own proposals could form the basis of a pincer movement with the Lib Dems to force the legislation on to the statute book.
