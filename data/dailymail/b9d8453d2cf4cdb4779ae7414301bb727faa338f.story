New video evidence in the Bruce Jenner car crash incident could spell trouble for the transitioning reality star following the four-car incident that left one person dead and seven injured on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, earlier this month.

An MTA bus traveling behind the Hummer involved is reported to have captured the entire incident on mounted cameras, evidence that is now in the hands of the police.

The footage, which has been reconstructed, shows the 65-year-old former Olympian smash his Cadillac Escalade into the back of both the victim’s white Lexus and the Toyota Prius involved.

New video evidence could spell trouble for Bruce Jenner, according to reports, following the four-car incident that left one person dead and seven injured on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu earlier this month

Bruce Jenner surveys the crash scene: An MTA bus traveling behind the Hummer involved is reported to have captured the entire incident on mounted cameras, evidence that is now in the hands of the police

Most significantly  the video shows that the Lexus driver didn’t make contact with the Prius involved, reports TMZ.

Sources familiar with the video told TMZ that Jenner hits the Lexus, propelling it into a Hummer coming the other way. Jenner then continues on and hits the Prius.

If correct, the MTA video makes a more compelling case that Jenner was following too close, which opens the door to a possible vehicular manslaughter prosecution, claims TMZ.

According to previous reports, the Lexus had been in Jenner's path after coming to a halt when it hit a Prius travelling ahead.

The Lexus was then pushed into the path of a Hummer coming the other way, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant, 69-year-old Kim Howe, dead.

The Kardashian family patriarch, who escaped the crash unscathed, took a roadside sobriety test in front of officers in the wake of the collision, which he passed.

This latest evidence suggests that rather than the chain reaction being caused by the victim's Lexus hitting the Prius in front of her, Jenner may have hit both cars, claims TMZ. 

Law enforcement sources told the celebrity news site that one operating theory is that the Prius had been stopped behind cars and, as a traffic light turned green, vehicles began moving.

It was at this point, sources say, that Jenner rear-ended the Lexus and when the Lexus cleared his lane, his car kept moving and crashed into the Prius.

TMZ reported that police say when Jenner hit the Lexus, it veered left while his Escalade moved to the right.

Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation. If any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison.

If it is determined that Jenner's Escalade struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely, it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely than if he was just part of the chain reaction, TMZ claims. 

Investigations will determine if Jenner, or any of the other three drivers involved in the collision, were texting or on their mobile phones at the time of the collision.

It is illegal to text while driving in California.

The star's representative has denied that he was texting behind the wheel.

Breaking his silence on the crash the following day, Jenner said in a statement: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident.'

'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.'

But three days after the crash, Jenner was seen talking on his phone while driving in Los Angeles.

The reality star had the device pressed to his ear while behind the wheel in Thousand Oaks, California.
