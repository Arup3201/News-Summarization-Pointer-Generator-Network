Police investigating Jimmy Savile are poised to make fresh arrests this week after Gary Glitter was taken into custody.

The convicted paedophile was the first to be detained in what is expected to be a wave of arrests of celebrities and former BBC staff.

Detectives warned Savile’s living accomplices last week that ‘we are coming for you’, and have drawn up a detailed arrest strategy.

Pop star: Glitter was yesterday arrested at his home after being accused of sexual offences in connection with the Jimmy Savile scandal

Taken away: The Metropolitan Police swooped yesterday at 7:15am to arrest the 68-year-old pop star, whose real name is Paul Gadd, at his London house

They have refused to discuss who will be next in line for questioning.

Comedian Freddie Starr has strenuously denied groping a 14-year-old girl
in Savile’s BBC dressing room but he announced on Friday that he was 
prepared to speak to police about it.

PR guru Max Clifford claimed dozens of big-name stars from the 1960s and
70s have contacted him because they fear being implicated in the 
widening child abuse scandal.

He said young girls threw themselves at the celebrities but they ‘never asked for anybody’s birth certificate’.

Mr Clifford said: ‘I think there are a lot of very famous people who are very concerned and very frightened.’

Police arrived at former pop star Glitter’s flat in Marylebone, central 
London, at 7.15am and arrested him on suspicion of committing sexual 
offences.

Wearing a bobble hat, thick grey coat, grey trousers, black gloves and 
sunglasses, the 68-year-old, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was later 
ushered into an unmarked police car.

He was questioned at Charing Cross police station for nearly ten hours, 
while officers scoured his flat for evidence. They removed several black
sacks.

Gadd was released on police bail until mid-December pending further 
inquiries. He arrived home in a taxi at 5.15pm and refused to comment.

He is the first person to be arrested in relation to Operation Yewtree, the Savile abuse inquiry.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘Officers working on Operation Yewtree 
have today arrested a man in his 60s in connection with the 
investigation.

Police leave the home of Gary Glitter in central London after the former pop star was arrested

Arrested: Glitter, born in Banbury, Oxfordshire, had a hugely successful music career in the 1970s

Driven away: Glitter was seen getting into a car outside his home in central London

'The man, from London, was arrested at approximately 
7.15am on suspicion of sexual offences, and has been taken into custody 
at a London police station. The individual falls under the strand of the
investigation we have termed “Savile and others”.’

Gadd, originally from Banbury, Oxfordshire, was jailed for four months 
in 1999 for downloading child porn. Later he was imprisoned in Vietnam 
for child-sex offences.

Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, is being described as one 
of the most prolific sex offenders in UK history. He is thought to have 
abused at least 300 victims over four decades, and police are following 
more than 400 leads.

Probe: Police are investigating devastating claims that Jimmy Savile, who died last year, sexually abused 300 young people over a 40-year period

Others thought vulnerable to arrest include a former BBC employee who 
was a close associate of Savile. The Mail revealed three weeks ago how 
he allegedly ‘procured’ girls for the star, and has also been accused of
committing rape himself on BBC premises.

A former singer claimed last night that she had a relationship with Savile spanning  almost two decades, and aborted his baby.

Donna Foot, 50, of Leatherhead, Surrey, said she met the late Jim’ll Fix
It presenter when he flattered her outside BBC studios, but she had no 
idea that he was a paedophile.

The mother of two said she felt physically sick to remember  how she had
almost given birth to Savile’s child, and was  glad she had gone 
through with the abortion.

Meanwhile, a video has emerged of a moment when Savile groped a petrified teenager on live TV.

Sylvia Edwards can be seen sitting next to Savile on Top of the Pops as 
he announces the next song to viewers, surrounded by teenage girls.

Then a horrified Sylvia leaps off her seat, shrieks and tries  to move 
away from smirking Savile, who calmly talks into  the camera.

The presenter grins as he puts his hand up her skirt, tries to grab her 
bottom and fondles her as she looks distressed  and attempts to wriggle 
free from him.

Pop star: Glitter's name was chosen after he worked through the alphabet for an alliterative phrase

Former pop star Gary Glitter is barely recognisable today from the confident star of 1970s glam rock.

In his prime, he enjoyed transatlantic success with a string of hits, selling 18 million records in five years in the early 70s.

Glitter was born Paul Gadd in Banbury, Oxfordshire, in 1944 and began his search for fame in his teenage years as a singer on the club circuit.

His first attempts to break into the charts failed, but when the glam era began his Glitter persona helped him to shoot to stardom.

The name was chosen after Gadd worked through the letters of the alphabet looking for an alliterative phrase, having ruled out Terry Tinsel and Stanley Sparkly.

His breakthrough hit, Rock and Roll (Parts One and Two), reached the top 10 in both the US and UK and in the following years, as Glitter, he continued to prove popular as he returned the top of the charts.

At 5ft 6in, Glitter's stage presence was boosted by the addition of platform heels and big hair. But as the glam era fizzled out, he found himself divorced, bankrupt and struggling with alcohol abuse.

In the 1980s and 1990s he enjoyed occasional comebacks and enjoyed a measure of celebrity touring as a student novelty act.

In later life, Glitter was reported to have been living in Spain and then Cuba, before moving to South East Asia, where he was jailed for child sex offences in Vietnam in 2006.

He returned to the UK in 2008. The 68-year-old now faces further police questions in connection with Scotland Yard's investigation into allegations of sex abuse by Jimmy Savile.
