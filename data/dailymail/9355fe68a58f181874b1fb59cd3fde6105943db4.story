The American football star who claimed last week that he lost his NFL career because he was a vocal advocate of same-sex marriage has said he has no regrets and stands by his allegations that his former coach Mike Priefer is a ‘bigot’.

Former Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe accused Priefer of repeatedly making homophobic comments including telling him he would 'burn in hell with the gays', in an article published last Thursday.

Priefer has refuted the allegations, but on Monday Kluwe told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that he stood by his original comments and denied that his actions were caused by bitterness that his playing career has ended.

‘I am 100 percent confident that everything I wrote related how it happened,’ said Kluwe.

In the wake of Kluwe’s accusations, the Minnesota Vikings have retained a former chief justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court to conduct an independent investigation. 

‘It is extremely important for the Vikings organization to react immediately and comprehensively with an independent review of these allegations,’ said Vikings’ president Mark Wilf.

Kluwe told CNN that he was encouraged by the team's decision, but he also demanded anonymity for any teammates willing to speak out, so their careers couldn’t be jeopardized as he believes his was after he became an advocate for gay marriage.

Priefer has released a statement denying Kluwe’s allegations. ‘I want to be clear that I do not tolerate discrimination of any type and am respectful of all individuals.

'I personally have gay family members who I love and support just as I do any family member,’ he said.

In the Deadspin article, I Was An NFL Player Until I Was 
Fired By Two Cowards And A Bigot, Kluwe
 called Priefer a ‘bigot’ and then-coach Leslie Frazier and General 
Manager Rick Spielman ‘two cowards’ for their roles in his firing.

Kluwe
 alleges that Preifer 'said on multiple occasions that I would wind up 
burning in hell with the gays, and that the only truth was Jesus Christ 
and the Bible' and said in a meeting that 'we should round up all the 
gays, send them to an island, and then nuke it until it glows.'

Priefer has said that such comments conflict with the atmosphere he has tried to create as a coach.

'The primary reason I entered coaching was to affect people in a positive way,' he wrote.

'As
 a coach, I have always created an accepting environment for my players,
 including Chris, and have looked to support them both on and off the 
field.'

During his final season as a Vikings player, Chris Kluwe was an outspoken advocate for same-sex marriage

Priefer is said 
to be well-liked within the organization and several players have come 
to his defense on Twitter, including Jeff Locke - the punter who 
replaced Kluwe - and kicker Blair Walsh, as well as fullback Jerome 
Felton and safety Harrison Smith.

In
 a statement on Thursday the Vikings said Kluwe was released based 
solely on his football performance: 'Any notion that Chris was released 
from our football team due to his stance on marriage equality is 
entirely inaccurate and inconsistent with team policy.'

Kluwe says he will fully cooperate with the Vikings' investigation and has hired legal counsel to represent him.

'I want the truth to come out from the investigation, not in litigation,' said Kluwe.

He
 told CNN on Monday that he had eight wonderful years at the Vikings and
 his problems were solely with the three individuals that he had named 
in his original article.
