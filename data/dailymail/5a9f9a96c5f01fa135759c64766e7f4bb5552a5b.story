A grand jury in Ferguson did not reach a decision on Friday over whether they will indict the officer who shot Michael Brown, sources have told CNN.

Tension is steadily building in the Missouri city as they wait for the decision concerning Darren Wilson, who shot the 18-year-old dead in August. 

It had been expected to come on Friday, but law enforcement officials told the station that the group had not come to an agreement and were still in session.

Tensions: The delay in the grand jury decision over whether to indict Darren Wilson - the officer who shot 18-year-old Michael Brown dead - came as Ferguson experienced a third night of unrest 

Heightened security: There was large police presence in the city as the community prepared for troubles

There was also questions over when they will next reconvene. 

Overnight authorities arrested three protesters during a third straight night of unrest, while business owners have boarded up their windows in preparation for expected troubles.

St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch has said the grand jury decision will be announced this month. 

His spokesman, Ed Magee, told reporters at around noon on Friday that the grand jury was still in session. Five hours later, though, Magee declined to say whether the panel was still meeting. 

He did not respond to messages seeking comment Saturday. 

St. Louis County police said large groups of protesters blocked traffic three times in the St. Louis suburb Friday night. 

Officer Darren Wilson (right) - who is allegedly stepping down from the Ferguson police force as a result of the scandal - reportedly told the grand jury that he feared for his life when he confronted Michael Brown 

That happened twice near the police station and once on West Florissant Avenue, the site of violent protests soon after Brown's death. 

A motorist lost control and crashed into a light pole during the unrest on West Florissant. Protesters converged on the car, but no one was hurt. 

Calls for peace and restraint emanated from several quarters, including President Barack Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder and civil-rights leaders and business owners.

The most emotional appeal came from Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr.

'Hurting others or destroying property is not the answer,' Brown said in the video released by the group STL Forward. 'No matter what the grand jury decides, I don't want my son's death to be in vain. I want it to lead to incredible change, positive change, change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone.'

Holder issued a general reminder to police to prepare for demonstrations and to 'minimize needless confrontation.'

His video message did not explicitly mention Ferguson, but it did reference demonstrations over the past few months that have 'sought to bring attention to real and significant underlying issues involving police practices.'

Attoney Gray, the attorney for Brown's family, spoke about preparations being made for the grand jury decision on Friday. They were told that the group were still in session and deliberating

Obama also urged Ferguson to keep the protests peaceful, saying all Americans have the right to peacefully assemble to speak against actions they regard as unjust. But, he said, using any event as an excuse for violence is contrary to the rule of law.

The president commented in an interview with ABC News scheduled to air Sunday. The network released his comment about Ferguson on Friday night.

Eddie Hassaun of the civil rights group Justice Disciples urged protesters not to be confrontational and for police to follow suit.

'We're looking for the action on the other side to be equally as committed to peace in the streets and peace for the demonstrators,' Hassaun said. 

Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, shot the black unarmed 18-year-old shortly after noon on August 9 in the center of a street, after some sort of scuffle occurred between them. As Brown's body lay there for hours, an angry crowd gathered. 

Riots and looting occurred the next night. In the following days, police responded with tear gas and smoke canisters as some protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails. 

Wilson reportedly told the Grand Jury that he feared for his life when he was confronted by Brown.
