Found? A car belonging to missing teacher Lisa Hayden-Gordon, 51, has been found in a Florida river

A car belonging to a missing Florida music teacher has been found submerged in a river more than a month after she vanished following a night out.

Police have said that a body was found inside the car but have not yet confirmed if it belongs to Lisa Hayden-Gordon,  CBS reported. The 51-year-old piano instructor went missing after watching a concert with friends on January 24.

The vehicle was found submerged in the New River near Cooley's Landing Marina in Fort Lauderdale on Friday and teams pulled it out from the water.

The body will now be taken to the medical examiner's office for processing. 

Hayden-Gordon had gone out with a man she met online and several of her friends, and they attended a Keller Williams show at Revolution Live in Fort Lauderdale.

The group  wanted to take her home because they thought she had had too much to drink, but she went to the restroom at a bar, the Poorhouse, and never returned.

They looked for her but when they could not find her anywhere, they ended up leaving, and she has not been seen since.

A friend told CBS that people had seen Hayden  walking away from a bar with her keys in her hand the night she went missing.

'Everybody who saw her that night said that she was so happy and having just a good time,' her sister Tara Cloe previously told the Sun Sentinel. 'She's always singing, she was probably singing the whole time during the concert. And then she left.'

Police admitted two weeks ago that they had few leads. 

'We do not believe that she voluntarily left the area,' police spokeswoman DeAnna Greenlaw said.

'We do not know if possibly she was involved in some type of crash or an accident when she did leave the downtown area. We don't know if she met up with someone. There's a lot of unknowns right now.

'We are basically exhausting our resources and we will continue to do that in hopes of locating her or her vehicle.' 

Hayden-Gordon had driven a distinctive blue 2003 Hyundai Elantra that was decorated with stickers of the sun, moon and stars on its hood. 

Missed: There has been no sign of Hayden-Gordon, known as 'Noodle' to her friends and students, since she left a concert and went to a restroom but witnesses said they saw her walking away with her car keys

Friends have made tearful pleas for information about the woman they called 'Noodles', a nickname that stuck after she became addicted to the food while in hospital recovering from a car accident as a child. 

'My sister would never leave us. And she's the most loving, outgoing, friendly person,' Susan O'Leary told the Sun Sentinel.

'For her not to be here, be a part of our lives, I don't even know how to tell you what kinds of emotions you could have. We don't know what to do, where else to go, where else to turn.'

Authorities urge anyone with information to call police at 954-764-4357 or Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-8477.
