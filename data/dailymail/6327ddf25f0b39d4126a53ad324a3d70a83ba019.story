Brendan Rodgers insists Liverpool will remain an attractive destination for the game’s top players even when they lose one of their biggest stars.

Liverpool’s manager was determined to move on this Thursday by drawing a line under the story of Steven Gerrard leaving, stressing it was time ‘to concentrate on football’ when asked about his captain’s revelation that he would have stayed had a contract been offered last summer.

What Rodgers did recognise, however, is that 34-year-old’s move to LA Galaxy leaves a void on and off the pitch. One ramification is that he will never be able to use the line ‘come and play with Steven Gerrard’ again when making a big sales pitch.

Rodgers, though, is refusing to lose heart and he maintains Liverpool have a duty to be competing at the top end of the market.

‘We have to have confidence that in the time I have been here, there have been some outstanding players who have come,’ said Rodgers. ‘But there is no doubt we need to replace that quality, either through some young players getting an opportunity or our players stepping up to the mark.

‘But (it is) also (about) bringing in that quality. Time will tell on that. It has been difficult and over the last couple of years, some of our top players have gone out. No one knows that more than me. The likes of Suarez leaving and Carragher going in the first year.

‘They were fantastic players. Steven is going to move on. I want to work with that level of player. As a coach and manager, I enjoy working equally with the stars and the world-class talent as I do with young players so I am not purely one who needs to work with young players.

‘If you speak with the elite and world-class players, they will say they enjoyed working with me. But for us it is something that needs to be done. This is Liverpool - we have to be in the running for the world’s best.’

Yet even with Gerrard, Liverpool have found it difficult to woo big names and in the last two years, for one reason or another, they have missed out on Alexis Sanchez, Diego Costa, Willian and Henrikh Mkhitaran. They struggle to complete deals but Rodgers says Liverpool’s name still appeals.

‘We have to believe it can be done,’ said Rodgers. ‘Last season after nearly winning the league and playing a game that excited people, we were in a great position to attract a level of player. The team has changed but the great name of Liverpool is still the same.

‘It is still a big attraction for players. Hopefully we can still keep moving forward and come the end of the season, we will be in the Champions League having won something as well. You have to keep working to find the players who’ll make you the best you can be.’

One positive for Rodgers is that he should soon be able to call on Daniel Sturridge again. The England international has returned from undergoing intensive rehabilitation in the United States and it is hoped he will be available ‘towards the end of January’.

‘We have to trust the work he has done,’ said Rodgers. ‘It has been very good and when he comes back he hopefully sustains his fitness.’

Meanwhile, Dr Zaf Iqbal, Liverpool’s first-team doctor since 2010 has left his post abruptly. No reason has been given for his departure.
