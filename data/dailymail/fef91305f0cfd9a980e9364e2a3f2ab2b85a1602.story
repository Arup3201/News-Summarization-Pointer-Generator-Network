England assistant manager Gary Neville has been accused of telling a cameraman to ‘f*** off’ during a walk in Rio de Janeiro.

According to FA sources, the Sky Sports pundit and former Manchester United star finally snapped after being followed for around a mile by a persistent cameraman just hours after the England squad arrived in Brazil for the World Cup.

In one picture which circulated on Twitter, an angry-looking Neville was seen glowering into the camera while being followed by a man dressed head-to-toe in small Brazil flags.

Having checked in to the team hotel, Neville was said to have gone for a walk on Sao Conrado beach with other members of the England party.

According to Globoesporte, which is part of Brazil’s biggest broadcaster, he then told the photographers and cameramen following him to leave him alone, shouting at one: 'Do you speak English? Back off. I just want to walk on the beach,'

It is also reported that he put his hand over one camera lens and swore.
