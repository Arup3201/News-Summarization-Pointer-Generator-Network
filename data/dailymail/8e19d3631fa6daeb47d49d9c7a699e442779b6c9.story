In four billion years, the Andromeda galaxy will come hurtling into the Milky Way - tearing planets and suns into new orbits in a fearsome and turbulent battle.

But Andromeda - flying towards us at more than 250,000 miles an hour - is already a bit of a galactic warrior, having already bumped up against the Triangulum Galaxy (otherwise known as M33).

Recent studies with the National 
Science Foundation's Green Bank Telescope (GBT)Â  seem to confirm a disputed 2004 discovery of hydrogen gas streaming
between Andromeda and the 
Triangulum.

Fast: Andromeda (pictured) is plowing toward Earth's galaxy at roughly 250,000 miles per hour, which is the equivalent of traveling from Earth to the moon in 60 minutes

Bruised victim: The Triangulum galaxy (pictured), which is 2.3 million light years away, had a near miss with Andromeda

Jay Lockman, of 
the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, said: 'The properties of this gas indicate that these two galaxies may 
have passed close together in the distant past.

'Studying what may be a
gaseous link between the two can give us a new key to understanding the
evolution of both galaxies.'

The two galaxies, about 2.6 and 3 million light-years, respectively,
from Earth, are members of the Local Group of galaxies that includes 
our own Milky Way and about 30 others.

The hydrogen 'bridge' between the galaxies was discovered in 2004 by
astronomers using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in the 
Netherlands, but other scientists questioned the discovery on technical 
grounds.

Detailed studies with the highly-sensitive GBT confirmed the 
existence of the bridge, and showed six dense clumps of gas in the 
stream.

Observations of these clumps showed that they share roughly the same
relative velocity with respect to Earth as the two galaxies, 
strengthening the argument that they are part of a bridge between the 
two.

Starting off as a tiny speck in the distance, the galaxy known as Andromeda (left of the picture) looks harmless at first

Previously just a small dot, earthlings of the future would be forgiven for panicking as Andromeda moves closer to our galaxy

The formerly tiny galaxy now dominates the foreground of the computer generated image as it swallows up the Milky Way

When galaxies pass close to each other, one result is 'tidal tails' 
of gas pulled into intergalactic space from the galaxies as lengthy 
streams.

'We think it's very likely that the hydrogen gas we see between
M31 and M33 is the remnant of a tidal tail that originated during a 
close encounter, probably billions of years ago,' said Spencer Wolfe, of
West Virginia University.

He added: 'The encounter had to be long ago, because 
neither galaxy shows evidence of disruption today.'

Lockman said: 'The gas we studied is very tenuous and its radio emission is 
extremely faint - so faint that it is beyond the reach of most radio 
telescopes.

'We plan to use the advanced capabilities of 
the GBT to continue this work and learn more about both the gas and, 
hopefully, the orbital histories of the two galaxies.'

The Aftermath: Following the collision of the two galaxies, a countless number of stars will be sent spinning into space as Andromeda and the Milky Way lose their previous forms

On
to our own deadly encounter with Andromeda: The head-on encounter is 
expected to happen four billion years from now - catapulting our sun to 
another area of the galaxy, with stars tossed on to different orbits, 
astronomers at the Space Telescope Science Institute revealed last 
month.

Although Earth and its solar system won't be destroyed, it will be pushed away from the galactic core more than it is now.

'After
nearly a century of speculation about the future destiny of Andromeda 
and our Milky Way, we at last have a clear picture of how events will 
unfold over the coming billions of years,' said Sangmo Tony Sohn, 
Baltimore, Maryland-based institute.

After
the Andromeda galaxy finally strikes the Milky Way, it will be another 
two billion years before the two totally come together and form a single
elliptical galaxy.

Impact: Earth won't be destroyed when Andromeda smashes into the Milky Way (pictured), but stars will likely be tossed into different orbits and it will take an additional two billion years for the two galaxies to totally merge
