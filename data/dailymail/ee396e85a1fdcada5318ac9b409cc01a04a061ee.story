Zlatan Ibrahimovic is loved by all in the French capital, and the Paris Saint-Germain striker will receive his very own waxwork.

The Swedish striker visited the Musee Grevin - the French version of Madame Tussauds - where work began on his own statue of his famous celebration.

Ibrahimovic was measured, molded in wax and covered in cling film on his visit to the famous waxwork museum, which is home to more than 300 statues.

The statue of Ibrahimovic's famous celebration will be ready towards the end of the year or early 2015 for the French public to view.

Such is his status in France, the Swede will become only the second foreign footballer after Pele to receive his own statue at Musee Grevin.

Ibrahimovic told PSG's official website: 'It was a really fantastic day. It's a great honour for me to have my own wax statue, here at the Musée Grévin.

'I am very happy to have been chosen to stand alongside all these international celebrities. Don't forget to come and see me when the statue is unveiled!'

Zlatan's waxwork will soon be rubbing shoulders with the likes of Zinedine Zidane and George Clooney.

Museum president Béatrice de Reyniès explained: 'First of all we took all his information, all his measurements, we made a scan. Now we will work in our studios, first on the scan, to create a prototype and then the sculptor can begin his sculpture.

'He will then have a second rendezvous with Zlatan to see how the likeness is. In total, the whole project will take around 6 months.'

Ibrahimovic moved to Paris from AC Milan in 2012 in a deal worth around £16m and he has scored 56 goals in Ligue 1 during his two seasons with the club.
