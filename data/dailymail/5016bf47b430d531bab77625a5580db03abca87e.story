The shocking moment when a cicada breaks through its creepy larva shell to emerge as a fully-grown vivid green adult, has been captured by a photographer.

The stunning shots show the creature making its strange journey through its own former shell before unfurling its new wings to dry them out.

Photographer Thomas Marent was lucky enough to witness the strange process, which took around 30 minutes.

The bugs spend most of their lives beneath the Earth and can lie there for 17 years. They only venture above ground level to shed their ugly larva shells and sprout wings to become adults.

Once matured, they sing for a mate.

Mr Marent saw the cicada, still within its larva shell, clamber up a plant close to an exit tunnel in the ground where it had previously lived, and choose a leaf strong enough to support its weight - suitable for the creature's transformation.

As the cicada begins to emerge, the amazing photographs show the stages at which the insect's wings begin to unfurl.

However, they are still soft and wet and need to be aired out, so the cicada stretches them out so they are able to dry.

The whole process from 'birth' to developing its fully grown wings took 30 minutes.

Mr Marent, 47, captured the transformation at Palmerston National Park in Queensland, Australia.

The professional nature photographer from Neuenhof, Switzerland, said: 'I was at the camping ground of the park and there were hundreds of horseflies around me, the car and the tent.

When the cicada has wriggled out of its restrictive shell, it gradually unfurls its delicate wings, which are soft and wet (pictured left) and then spreads them fully to they can dry out (pictured right) It is hanging on to its discarded former 'nymphal case'Â  or shell

'The horseflies disappeared when it got dark at 6pm so I decided to explore the forest area at night.

'Equipped with cameras, flashes and a torch I walked along a small trail and after seeing a few katydids and spiders, I found a cicada larva crawling on the forest floor.

'I watched and waited for an hour until it found a decent spot to rest and start the metamorphosis on a twig.

'After two hours nothing happened so I lost my patience and went back to my tent to sleep - but all I could think about was the cicada larva.'

Kept awake by the thought of missing a great photographic opportunity, Mr Marent left his tent at around midnight and walked back to the spot where he had seen the cicada.

'Right on time the cicada larva started 
its metamorphosis and I grabbed my camera and took all the pictures of 
the different stages,' he said.

Cicadas live underground as nymphs for most of their lives, at depths ranging from about 30 centimetres to 2.5 metres. The nymphs feed on root juice and have strong front legs for digging. They construct an exit tunnel to the surface and emerge to molt (pictured) on a nearby plant for the last time to emerge as adults

'I was so lucky. After about 30 minutes the metamorphosis was done and I could calmly go back with a good conscience for a nice sleep.'

Mr Marent fulfilled a lifetime ambition of photographing a cicada emergence from start to finish.

He said: 'I've wanted to photograph a cicada larva for many years so I could get all the different stages from their birth.

'In the past I've seen loads of empty nymphal cases hanging on twigs or tree trunks but I finally managed to see the whole process this time.'
