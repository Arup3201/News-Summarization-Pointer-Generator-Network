It was billed as a David and Goliath moment that came to symbolise the power of the people over the might of the machine.

As violent demonstrations raged in Egyptian capital Cairo on Tuesday, images of a government tank being pushed off a bridge by a handful of protesters were beamed around the world, fuelling the authorities' justification for its brutal and deadly crackdown.

But new footage has emerged that appears to show the armoured vehicle did not in fact fall but reversed off the overpass without any help at all.

The van plunged off the 6th October 
Bridge on Tuesday before demonstrators attacked the wreckage.

It is not 
known how many people were on board and how many people survived the 
fall, but bloodied men were seen lying around the van moments 
afterwards. Unconfirmed reports on Twitter claimed five were dead.

The dramatic pictures showed the van being ambushed by dozens of people before crashing through a
 protective fence on the bridge.

can then be seen on the ground as nearby police officers pull injured 
men out of the crushed vehicle.  

But
 today's footage, filmed from the window of a high-rise apartment 
building 400 metres away, shows the incident was in fact due to driver 
error.

It happened on a day
 of violence which left at least 343 people dead as police clashed with 
protesters angry over a lethal clampdown by security forces who stormed a
 camp to clear protesters supporting deposed President Mohamed Morsi.

Witnesses
 said many of those killed were hit by snipers on surrounding rooftops. 
Heavily-armed police and troops reportedly opened fire with machine guns
 on thousands of demonstrators, including women and children.

As Egypt descended into bloody violence, videos were broadcast which purported to show burned corpses on streets which resembled a war zone. British TV cameraman Mr Deane, working for Sky, was among those killed in the escalating violence, which provoked global condemnation.

The United States lead urgent calls for restraint warning that 'the world is watching.' Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan called on the U.N. Security Council and Arab League to take immediate steps to stop a 'massacre' in Egypt.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the violence is deplorable is a serious blow to reconciliation efforts, adding that it runs counter to Egyptians' aspirations for peace.

He urged Egypt's interim leaders to take a step back and calm the situation to avoid further deaths. He also said the U.S. strongly opposes a return to a state of emergency law and that should end as soon as possible.

David Cameron also condemned the violence, saying: 'What is required in Egypt is a genuine transition to a genuine democracy. That means compromise from all sides - the President Morsi supporters but also the military - that's what needs to happen.

Battle: Egyptian security forces are said to have opened fire on mostly unarmed protestors in the operation which began shortly after 7am local time

'We don't support this violence, we condemn it completely, it's not going to solve the problems.'

The Muslim Brotherhood claimed over 2,000 people had been killed and thousands wounded in eight hours of continuous firing while Egyptian authorities said Mr Morsi's supporters opened fire on security forces.

The exact death toll could not be confirmed but an AFP reporter counted at least 124 bodies in three separate locations around the camp in the capital, with many appearing to have died from gunshot wounds.
