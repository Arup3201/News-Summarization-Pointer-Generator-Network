More than 300 workers at luxury fashion label Mulberry's handbag factory are being screened for tuberculosis after two workers came down with the lung condition.

Staff at the brand's plant in Shepton Mallet in Somerset now face an anxious wait to see if they too have caught the disease, which can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

The most common symptoms of the infection include a persistent cough, weight loss and if left untreated, it can be fatal.

According to the Sun, two employees at the factory were diagnosed with the condition but were now back working at the plant.

It is thought one worker was confirmed as having TB in January, while another was diagnosed in May.

This prompted Mulberry to test the rest of their workforce at the Somerset factory for the condition and send letters to all 300 staff on advice from Public Health England as TB may not show symptoms for several years.Â 

A spokesperson told the newspaper: 'Mulberry has fully complied with Public Health England advice on this.'

It is thought that anyone else who tests positive for the condition will be referred to specialist doctors with Public Health England adding that it is very much now a curable disease, which can be treated.

TB almost disappeared from the UK by the early 1970s thanks to the BCG vaccination and antibiotics.

However, cases are now on the rise, which is being blamed on increased immigration from Eastern Europe where TB is more common.

British label Mulberry has long been the handbag of choice for many A-list celebrities including Kate Winslet and Sienna Miller.

Their ad campaigns are fronted by supermodel Cara Delevingne, who visited the Somerset factory in June ahead of launching her own collection for the brand.

In a film released ahead of the collection, it shows the 21-year-old visiting the archives, choosing leathers, sketching ideas and discussing the practical needs she had for a multi-functional bag.

She was also shown at the affected flagship factory using the sewing machines, discussing her designs and smelling the leather on a newly made Mulberry satchel.

Tuberculosis - or TB - killed one in four people during Victorian times but was almost wiped out in Britain by the 1970s.

Less crowded living conditions in the 20th Century cut infection. Administration of the BCG vaccine from the 1920s, the discovery of antibiotics in 1928 and the introduction of the antibiotic streptomycin also helped.

But there has been a dramatic rise in cases recently, especially in and around London, where 40 per cent of all TB cases are detected.

In 2011, 8,963 cases of TB were reported in the UK.

There is fear that the disease may spread further, due to a combination of foreign immigrants infected with TB coming to the UK, increased travel abroad, and hospital staff who are not trained to spot the disease from early symptoms.

Tuberculosis is a communicable disease caused by infection with the tubercle bacillus (also known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. tuberculosis), most frequently affecting the lungs.

These tiny bacteria are usually passed on through mucus in the same way as colds are passed on, such as when people sneeze, talk or cough.

The bacillus can remain active in the air for several hours in confined warm spaces such as planes and the London Underground

A cure for TB was developed more than 50 years ago, but it is still one of the top three killer diseases in the world, along with malaria and HIV. An untreated person with TB can spread the disease to ten to 15 people each year.
