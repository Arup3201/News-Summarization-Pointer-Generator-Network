A decorated World War II hero's son has been reunited with his father's five medals after losing them near the Cenotaph during yesterday's poignant ceremony.

William McMurdo, 65, was proudly wearing the honours, which belonged to his father Thomas McMurdo, when he dropped them while caught up in the large crowds.

They were found by veteran Cliff Palmer, 32, who immediately launched an online appeal through social media to track down their owner.

Mr Palmer, who was in the Royal Navy for ten years, uploaded the photos to Facebook and Twitter and they were shared by thousands of people in just a few hours. 

Today the pair met for the first time at the Cenotaph in London.

Retired gardener Mr McMurdo, from Lewisham, South East London, said he was distraught when he realised he had lost the medals

He said: 'I've never been so upset in all my life - I felt like I'd let my father down. It was so devastating I didn't even want to tell people about it when I got home.

'I spoke to police officers at the service and I was running around like a mad man trying to find them but I had no luck.

'But I was over-the-moon when I got the phone call to say they had been found. I heard about what Cliff had done in trying to track me down - it's absolutely incredible.

'I can't put into words how grateful I am for what he's done.

'When I heard that he had served in the Royal Navy, I knew he would understand how heart-breaking this has been for me.

'I'll be very glad to proudly wear them again on Remembrance Day.'

Mr McMurdo's father was awarded the five medals, which include the Africa Star, the Italy Star, a 1939-1945 Star, a Defence Medal and a War Medal, after fighting for the duration of World War II as a sergeant in the 8th Army.

His father was also awarded the bronze Oak Leaf and mentioned in dispatches for rescuing 20 comrades from a minefield at the infamous 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino, Italy, - which William proudly wore to the service.

Mr McMurdo, whose father passed away in 1976, added: 'It was a brilliant feeling so see Cliff walking towards me with the medals.

'As soon as I saw him I could tell he was an ex-serviceman - he looked very smart and professional.

'I have no idea how to thank him and those who helped get the medals back to me - it's been truly overwhelming.'

Mr Palmer, who served on a number of Type 42 ships during his time in the armed forces including HMS Ark Royal and HMS York, was thrilled to hand over the medals.

He said: 'I served in the Royal Navy for 10 years and it was my dream to see the Remembrance Service in London.

'It was a fantastic experience and then as I was crossing the road I could see the medals face down on the floor.

'A few people walked over them and my heart hit the floor - it was devastating.

'I picked them up and I couldn't believe my eyes - the owner of these medals is a true hero.

'That is what the Remembrance Service is all about - honouring the people that gave everything and more for our freedom.

'So I was determined to get them back to the owner and I posted a picture on my Facebook account but had no luck.

'But friends started seeing it and sharing it and one of my pals set up a Lostbox feed and the story went viral.'

Proud father Cliff, who now works as a part-time doorman, travelled from Bristol in the early hours of the morning to attend the service in London where he was left devastated to see the medals on the ground.

But after posting an image online - Clare Owen set up a page on Lostbox to share the image and help trace its original owner.

Cliff said: 'Clare has been absolutely fantastic - without her we'd never have found William.

'My grandfather had some of the same medals and he would have been absolutely distraught if he'd have lost his.

'I felt terrible when I saw them lying on the floor and I know William would have been exactly the same.

'But to see the look on his face when I gave them back was incredible.'
