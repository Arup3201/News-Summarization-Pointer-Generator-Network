A schoolboy has been left with a broken back after being knocked off his motorcycle by a driver who then swore at him and drove way from the scene.

Steven Smith was nearly paralysed in the hit-and-run smash, and his parents are appealing for help in bringing the driver to justice.

The teenager has recalled how the driver who hit the back of the bike walked over to him and said, 'serves you right' before leaving him bleeding in the road.

His father Paul said: 'Accidents do happen - but I would not have left a dog like this. He left my son in the road to die.'

Shock: Steven Smith, pictured in hospital with his mother Celia, sister Shirene and father Paul, broke his back in three places after being hit by a car while riding his motorbike

Steven was given the bike as a birthday present in November last year, and was riding round Old Whittington in Derbyshire on January 6 when he was hit by a black people-carrier.

After the driver sped off, a passer-by who knew first aid found him lying in the road and put him in the recovery position while waiting for an ambulance to arrive.

Doctors at Sheffield's Northern General Hospital believe her quick thinking may have saved Steven from being paralysed for life, and say that the teenager will eventually be able to walk again.

Two of the three breaks he sustained to his back are set to mend on their own, but the third, which is close to his spine, could require surgery.

Steven is currently recuperating in the hospital's spinal unit, where he will remain for the next two months, and is unable to stand or sit up.

He has had to put his plans to leave school and become a bricklayer on hold while he recovers from the crash.

Callous: The driver got out of his car and laughed at the victim before speeding off again

Recounting his ordeal, he said: 'All I remember is a black people-carrier clipping the back of my bike - he kept speeding up behind me before hitting me and I went flying into the air.

'The driver got out of the vehicle and walked over to me. I was in terrific pain but he just stood there effing and blinding, he said, "Serves you right", then he laughed and drove off.

'It was obvious I was badly injured but he thought it was funny.'

Steven continued: 'Luckily a woman with first aid experience found me. She realised I had a serious back injury and knew exactly what to do.

'If it hadn't been for her I could be spending the rest of my life in a wheelchair.'

Scene: The accident happened while Steven was riding in Old Whittington in Derbyshire

His mother Celia said she had been almost unable to process the horror of her son's accident.

'I got the phone call every parent dreads,' she said. 'It was one of his friends who told me Steven had been involved in an accident.

'I screamed and dropped the phone. My daughter picked it up and found out where Steven was.

'We drove to the accident scene and found Steven covered in the blood and being treated by emergency services in the road. It was a terrible sight - a paramedic was cutting off his clothes and told us he had spinal injuries.

'We can't believe that anyone could be so heartless and cruel. The man even got out of the vehicle and swore at him. We are all devastated and just want Steven home and whoever did this caught.'

Mr Smith added: 'To leave a lad in the road without calling for help is callous. We just hope the appeal jogs someone's memory and they come forward.'
