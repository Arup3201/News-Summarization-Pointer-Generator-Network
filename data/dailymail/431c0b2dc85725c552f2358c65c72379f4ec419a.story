Malaysian authorities are hunting for a former policeman who is believed to be living in Australia after he had his acquittal over the murder of a model reversed as part of a high-level political corruption scandal. 

Malaysia's highest court on Tuesday upheld death sentences for two police officers convicted of killing and blowing up Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu, a 28-year-old model and interpreter.

Authorities in Malaysia said they will seek the help of the Australian Federal Police to arrest and extradite   one of the policemen, Sirul Azhar Umar, who flew to Australia in October last year.

Ms Shaariibuu was murdered in 2006 and was linked to a former associate of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in a sensational scandal involving allegations of high-level corruption that shook the long-ruling regime.

The allegations related to massive kickbacks in the $1.1 billion 2002 purchase of French Scorpene submarines.

Court testimony stated Ms Shaariibuu, who was involved in negotiations for the submarines, told her killers she was pregnant and begged for her life to be spared before she was shot twice in the head and then blown up with military-grade explosives, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The remains of Ms Shaariibuu were found in a jungle clearing near Kuala Lumpur.

Adding to the intrigue, she was a lover of Abdul Razak Baginda - the man in charge of purchasing the submarines and a close associate of current Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was defence minister at the time of the deal.

Allegations have simmered for years that Ms Shaariibuu was murdered to keep her quiet about purported kickbacks to high-level Malaysian officials.

Sirul and the second convicted policeman, Azilah Hadri, were members of an elite unit that guarded top Malaysian ministers and government critics have long alleged that the two men were scapegoats in Ms Shaariibuu's murder. 

The authoritarian government has long refused calls for a wide-ranging inquiry and the subject is taboo.

Both accused deny killing Ms Shaariibuu. Sirul has previously alleged he was being 'sacrificed' to protect others.

The Federal Court panel said Tuesday the two officers had both separately led investigators to the site where the body was found, which 'strengthened the case' against them.

A shocked-looking Azilah was led out of the courtroom Tuesday after the decision.

Sirul's defence team, however, told the court they did not know his whereabouts. An arrest warrant was issued.

Kuala Lumpur police chief Mohmad Salleh said Malaysia will liaise with the AFP if Sirul is found to still be in Australia.

But the extradition of Sirul would be problematic for Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, should he be located in Australia.

Mr Abbott last week said Australia 'opposes the death penalty' when speaking about the case of Bali Nine drug smuggler Myuran Sukumaran, whose appeal against his death sentence has been rejected by Indonesia.

Sirul and Azilah were convicted in 2009 and sentenced to hang, but released when an appeals court overturned the conviction in 2013 after raising questions about how their trial was conducted, prompting the prosecution's appeal to the Federal Court.

Critics frequently allege government manipulation of sensitive court cases.

The case centres on allegations French submarine maker DCNS paid commissions of more than 114 million euros ($142 million) to a shell company linked to Abdul Razak Baginda, who is not related to the premier.

Malaysia's opposition claims these were kickbacks.

No motive for Ms Shaariibuu's death has ever been revealed.

French judicial officials, acting on a request by Malaysian human rights group Suaram, opened an investigation in 2010 into the sale. The inquiry is ongoing.

Cynthia Gabriel, who runs a Malaysian anti-corruption NGO, welcomed the decision but said too many questions remain unanswered.

'For truth-seeking Malaysians, they want to know the motive for her brutal death and if anyone high up in the political leadership was also involved in the murder,' she said.

In 2008, private investigator P. Balasubramaniam implicated several government officials, including Najib, in the murder. He later recanted, saying he was being coerced to keep silent, and fled abroad.

Najib has denied any involvement.

Balasubramaniam returned in 2013 vowing to expose the truth, but died within two weeks of an apparent heart attack.
