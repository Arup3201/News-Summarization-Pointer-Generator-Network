Residents of a rural part of Nottinghamshire have suffered almost 100 earthquakes since Christmas.

The tremors around the village of New Ollerton are believed to have been caused by nearby coal-mining works.

The British Geographical Survey has recorded 93 quakes, all of less than 2.0 on the Richter scale, in the area since mid-December.

The village of New Ollerton in Nottinghamshire has been hit by 93 earthquakes since Christmas

They began a month after the Chancellor George Osborne visited the nearby Thoresby Colliery

The Thoresby Colliery is one of the last deep coal mines in Britain

Although the BGS said there was little risk that earthquakes this size would cause any structural damage, residents have reported that their homes are shaking and shuddering.

It began only a month after Chancellor George Osborne visited the nearby Thoresby Colliery, one of the last deep coal mines in Britain, to single out Nottinghamshire as a place where his economic plan is working. The BGS said: ‘This is an area with a history of seismic activity related to coal mining and the recent activity is consistent with this.

‘Earthquakes of this size are not likely to cause any damage and the hazard from mining-induced seismicity in the UK is typically low.’

There are roughly 200 to 300 earthquakes in Britain every year, but most are so small that no one notices.
