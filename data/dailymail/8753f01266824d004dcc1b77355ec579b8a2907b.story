The trial of a mentally-ill man who hacked a psychotherapist to death with a meat cleaver begins today.

Opening statements start on Monday in David Tarloff's murder trial after five years of uncertainty about whether he would ever be fit to stand in court.

Kathryn Faughey was brutally killed by Tarloff, 44, at her Manhattan office in 2008. His lawyers don't dispute that he killed the 56-year-old but they argue 
he was so psychotic that he shouldn't be held criminally responsible for
her death.

Prosecutors and Faughey's family say Tarloff carried out a considered, criminal plan.

Tarloff admitted he wanted to rob Faughey's colleague with whom she shared an office to get money to take his sick mother to Hawaii.

Tarloff was deemed mentally unfit for court months later. After doctors said his condition had improved, jury selection got started in 2010 but he was again declared unfit.

Authorities say that Tarloff set out with a bag full of knives
to hold up his psychiatrist for 
$40,000, grab his mother out of a nursing home and escape with her to 
Hawaii.

The case has stalled for years at a time because 
of the schizophrenic's mental state, which halted an attempt to 
try him in 2010.

If the trial goes forward, jurors will be asked to decide whether 
Tarloff, who has a decades-long history of hospitalizations and 
hallucinations about God and Satan speaking to him, knew he was doing 
wrong when he killed Faughey.

They had never met. He had said he was frightened that she was going to attack him because her long fingernails alarmed him.

'Believe me, I wish she was never there - but I thought she was evil,' 
Tarloff told a psychologist in 2010. 'I went to kill her. I thought I 
had no choice.'

'Everything about his thought process was so bizarre - so crazy - that 
the proof in the case shows he was legally insane,' lawyer Bryan Konoski
has said.

However prosecutors and Faughey's family feel that, whatever Tarloff's 
illness, his actions bespoke a considered, violent scheme.

'He planned this out' and was heavily armed, said Owen Faughey, one of 
her brothers.

'He was determined, it would seem, to stop anyone who 
would interfere with his plan. And, unfortunately, that's where our 
sister fell victim to his plan. He should be held fully accountable.

It was an accident that Tarloff and Faughey, a 56-year-old therapist who
specialized in helping people with relationships, met at all. Faughey 
shared an office with psychiatrist Dr Kent Shinbach, who treated 
Tarloff in 1991 but hadn't seen him since.

Yet in February 2008, as an increasingly panicky Tarloff tried to craft 
what he saw as a rescue plan for his mother, he thought of Shinbach. He 
figured the psychiatrist had money, and he'd get it from an ATM after 
forcing the doctor to disclose his code, Tarloff later told police and 
psychologists.

'I figured a little bump on the head. No one would know, and I would have $40,000,' Tarloff said.

He went to Shinbach's office one evening with a rubber mallet, a set of 
kitchen knives, rope, duct tape, a suitcase full of adult diapers and 
clothing for his mother â€” and a belief that the plan had God's blessing,
he told a psychologist.

He encountered Faughey instead and hacked her 15 times, then seriously wounded Shinbach when he tried to save her.

Tarloff, now 44, was a college student when his mind abruptly began 
fracturing into paranoid suspicions of classmates and a preoccupation 
with God and the devil.

Over the years, as he was hospitalized more than a dozen times, he 
recounted seeing 'Satan' spelled out in his mind and the 'eye of God' on
the kitchen floor, according to psychologists' reports and court 
papers. He heard police sirens and concluded they'd been summoned by his
bad thoughts.

He viewed pieces of paper on the street as a special 
message from God. His relatives begged him to stay in mental hospitals or adult homes, but he left them, psychologists said.

After his mother, Beatrice, moved from the Queens apartment they shared 
into a nursing home in 2004, Tarloff grew still more erratic and 
fixated. Convinced she wasn't getting good care at a series of homes, he
repeatedly clashed with staffers.

Two weeks before Faughey's death, he 
got arrested in a scuffle with a security guard at a hospital where his 
mother was being treated.

'Our mother is getting sick and it is making me extremely beyond any 
normal patience furious and unnerved,' he wrote to his brother around 
that time.

Tarloff is pursuing an insanity defense. It requires proving not only 
that he has a serious psychiatric disorder, but also that he didn't 
understand the nature or consequences of his actions.

Such defenses are offered for less than 1 per cent of felonies nationwide
and successful only about a quarter of the time, research has shown.

When they do succeed, defendants are acquitted but held in secure mental
hospitals until - if ever - a judge decides they're safe to release.

A jury was being chosen for Tarloff's trial in 2010 when he refused to 
leave a courthouse holding cell, ran nude around a psychiatric ward and 
was declared unfit for court, a finding separate from an insanity 
defense.
