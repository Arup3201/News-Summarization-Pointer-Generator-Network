Sacked: Scott Mcmillan, 39, lost his job after his staff in the clubhouse kitchen made a penis-shaped shortbread

A chef at a prestigious golf resort owned by U.S. billionaire Donald Trump was fired after his staff baked a penis-shaped shortbread - even though he   was on a day off when it happened.

Scott Mcmillan, 39, lost his job at Trump International Golf Links at Menie Park Lodge in Balmedie, near Aberdeen in Scotland, after his colleagues in the   clubhouse kitchen made the suggestive biscuit and posted it on his Facebook page with the message 'For Scott'.

After noticing he had been taken off the rota, Scott had a meeting with HR staff and was told the behaviour is not the 'Trump way'.

Another two chefs also lost their jobs as a result of the phallic shortbread.

Mr Mcmillan, of Aberdeen, told The Sun: 'I wasn't there and had absolutely nothing to do with it.

'It was the guys having a laugh - something that's happened in every kitchen I've ever worked in.

'Sacking people who have worked hard for the company over something as petty as this is pretty rough.'

He added that bosses confronted him with nine pages of pictures from his Facebook account, even though he claims his private account has nothing to do   with his employers.

A spokesperson for Trump said: 'We make no apology for terminating the contracts of a number of individuals for gross misconduct on our property.

'We offer a world class service and customers in our hotel, restaurant and golf complex are our number one priority.

'We will not tolerate unprofessionalism of any kind and so we took immediate action to protect the interests of our business and guests.'

Prestigious: The golf course, hotel and restaurant opened in July. It is one of a number of courses owned by Trump

The golf course, which opened in July, has been beset by controversy.  The property magnate has been accused of bullying local people into accepting his plans.

In February The Apprentice star Trump  lost a high-profile court battle after taking the Scottish government to task over their approval for an offshore wind farm in Aberdeen Bay.

He had hoped to build a the second 
18-hole links golf course, as well as a five-star hotel, luxury holiday 
homes and a residential village.

Trump claimed the wind farm would have a negative impact on the views from his luxury £750million links course in Menie.

As a result Trump announced his Trump Organisation would be focusing 'all of our investment and energy' on the Irish Doonbeg Golf Club in County Clare, with views over the Atlantic coast and renamed the Trump International Golf Links Ireland.
