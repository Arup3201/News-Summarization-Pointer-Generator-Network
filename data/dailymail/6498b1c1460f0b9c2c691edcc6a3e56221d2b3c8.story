A man who shot himself in the head while playing ‘Russian Roulette’ is fighting for his life.

Donnie McLendon, 26, is in a critical condition with a single gunshot wound after he was rushed to Florida hospital by others taking part in the deadly game, according to St Petersburg police.

McLendon was the third person to place a loaded weapon against his head and pull the trigger.

Hospitalized: Police say 26-year-old Donnie McLendon, pictured from a 2011 arrest, allegedly shot himself during a game of Russian Roulette

Changing stories: Witnesses first told police that McLendon, pictured, was the victim of a home invasion but later admitted to playing the deadly game Russian Roulette

Two other men taking part in the game, had fired the gun and survived.

The others taking part in the game had initially claimed that McLendon had been shot during a violent home invasion.

They claimed the ‘home invader’ shot McLendon in the head and then fled with the suspect dropping his gun.

But as detectives began making inquiries the men, named as Daniel McKee, 22, and Thomas Rady, 29, changed their story.

They said after drinking and smoking marijuana they began playing Russian Roulette.

Police recovered a .44 calibre handgun as well as a single bullet casing.

Police
said Mckee, Rady and Mckee's girlfriend, who was sleeping in another 
room at the home when the shooting took place, picked up McLendon and 
carried him to Mckee's car and drove him to the hospital.

Mckee told investigators he was house-sitting at the residence for a friend, police said.

‘At
this point, everything they told us of what happened (involving Russian
roulette) seems plausible,’ said police spokesman MIke Puetz

After he was treated at St. Anthony's, McLendon was transported to Tampa General Hospital where he remains in a critical condition.

No charges have been filed, but the investigation is ongoing, police said.

As a perhaps surprisingly popular game, captured in the film Deer Hunter starring Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken, McLendon is the Florida Bay Area's second victim in recent months.

In June a 17-year-old lost his life while playing the game with three other teenagers at his home in Largo.

On the West coast in California, a 35-year-old man lost his life in early September after shooting himself in the head at an apartment in San Bernardino while playing the game with three others.

The game has also been accused as a method of torture after four men allegedly held a Winter Garden, Florida family hostage while playing Russian roulette with their five-year-old son in February.
