Chinese journalist Chai Jing has been branded a hypocrite and traitor for giving birth to her daughter in the U.S. in October last year.

Chai, a China Central TV host, sparked the outcry based on her journalistic work.

She is dubbed the 'Chinese liberals’ goddess' and in the eyes of the public she is seen as an advocate for China.

As a journalist, Chai built an established career based on investigative work on the SARS outbreak, the Sichuan earthquake and coal mine accidents - becoming one of the country's most respected journalists.

Traitor: Giving birth to her daughter in the US last year has caused public debate in China over whether Jing, pictured in a US airport, did the right thing

In 2009 she spoke at the Beijing Journalists Association’s speech competition where she outlined the value of a strong nation.

The speech resonated deeply with the public and elevated Chai to celebrity journalist status.

'A country is built upon individuals; she is constructed and determined by them. It is only if a country has people who…build but do not take advantage of the land,' Chai said. 

When photographs of Chai holding her new born daughter, Chai Zhiran, in a U.S. airport emerged, the Chinese public was hurt and angered.

Acclaim: Jing was held in high regard by the Chinese public for her work advocating China

Giving birth to her child in the U.S. was seen to undermine Chai's work advocating the country and the people took to the web to vent their rage and label her a hypocrite and traitor.

Despite there being no confirmation that Chai's daughter is a U.S. citizen, the move has been labelled as unpatriotic. 

The images sent Weibio, China's version of Twitter with more than 300 million users, into a frenzy. 

Off Beat China reported that users did not agree with Chai's decision and were vocal about their reasons.

'I have no problem of her giving birth in the U.S. But she shouldn’t put on a show on TV as if she is a patriot and cares about this country or its people,' one user said.

Debate: Chinese social media went into a frenzy when news of Jing giving birth in the US broke

Another user said: 'If she is an ordinary mum, I won’t be so disgusted. But Chai’s been trying hard to establish herself as a patriot who cares about this country. If so, be a Chinese!'

'This shows the hypocrisy of liberals in China. Their credibility is declining. People are glowingly disappointed at these so-called liberals,' said another.

But not all the feedback was negative, with one person pointing out many others would do the same thing if given the opportunity.

'After all, U.S. has better environment, better healthcare, better education and better everything.'

The backlash is also fueled by China's culture of corruption with many corrupt officials, known as naked officials, moving their entire families overseas, but mainly to the U.S.

But to cash in the on their power the officials remain in China and are seen to have no desire to improve life in the country.

The practice of 'birth tourism' is popular with Chinese women who travel to the U.S. on tourist visas in order to give birth to children who automatically become American citizens.

The cost of having a so-called 'anchor baby' in America is estimated at $20,000. 

This includes accommodation, care in the weeks running up to the birth and for a month afterwards. 

Assistance with immigration paperwork is normally included in the deal.

The practice of 'birth tourism' does not violate federal law but there are dubious ethical issues surrounding the practice.

It is written into the U.S. constitution under the 14th Amendment that those born in the U.S. will be granted citizenship.

According to studies on 'birth tourism' it is popular with wealthy mothers-to-be from several countries including China, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey.

Although most mothers return home after giving birth, because their child has been born in the U.S., it allows them to get around strict international rules for studying at American colleges.

Once they turn 21, the children can also petition for permanent residency for their parents through family reunification.

The government estimates that there were 7,462 births to foreign residents in 2008.

The Center for Immigration Studies said close to 40,000 births each year are to 'birth tourists' - however that number could be as high as 200,000.
