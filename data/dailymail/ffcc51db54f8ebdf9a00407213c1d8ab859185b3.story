California house building is on the increase as Chinese buyers look to invest in vast sums of money in property abroad.

Experts say that for many buyers money is not an issue and property is being bought for up to $1.5million in cash.

House builders are even using Feng Shui in their designs to suit the Chinese market.

Architects are also making plans to accommodating more than two generations of a family. 

Realtors say Asian families are attracted
 to the state by the quality of education and the potential for price 
growth on the homes.

Property investments account for 14 per cent of China's total GDP with real estate and construction a major driving force in the world's second largest economy.

Many wealthy Chinese people are looking to invest abroad as the housing boom in the country spirals.

Kinney Yong, of RE/MAX Premier Realty, told NBC: 'They see the market here still has room for appreciation. What's driving them over here is that they have this cash, and they want to park it somewhere or invest somewhere.'

Companies such as Lennar, Pulte, K Hovnanian and Ryland are buoyant are a difficult time during the housing crash.

According to NBC, 20,000 turned up to look at the plans and model homes of the Great Park Neighborhood, in Orange County.

Most of those thinking about investing in one of the 5,000 planned homes were Asian.

Emile Haddad, chief executive of 
Fivepoint Communities, which is developing the Great Park Neighborhood, 
told NBC: 'We are seeing a lot of Asians who are buying as an 
investment, but their kids are going to school here, so kids live in the
 home.'

Some families are concerned about instability at home and fears that the property bubble in China will burst.

This year, the government gave virtually no warning before a mandatory 20 per cent tax was introduced on homes, sparking panic among owners.

After the Chinese government gave citizens the right to buy their own homes in 1998, the middle classes invested heavily in the property market, primarily because there was nowhere else to put their money.

The result was a massive housing boom and although official statistics vary wildly, some economists claim that in the capital Beijing, prices rose by a staggering 250 per cent between 2006 and 2010.
