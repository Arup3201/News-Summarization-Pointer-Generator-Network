Zlatan Ibrahimovic set his sights on winning the Champions League with Paris Saint-Germain next season as the French side continued their pre-season preparations in Hong Kong.

The Swedish superstar looked as though he was feeling the intense heat as PSG trained on Saturday ahead of their latest warm-up match with local side Kitchee.

Ibrahimovic returns to action after a summer free of tournament football and was quickly back into his stride on the practice field.

And the striker was still smiling later as he took to the catwalk at a fashion show for Swiss watchmaker Hublot.

Ibrahimovic, who watched the World Cup from the sidelines after Sweden failed to qualify, captained PSG in their last friendly - a 2-1 win at Nice on Wednesday night.

They reached the last eight of the Champions League last season before being eliminated on away goals by Chelsea.

PSG kick off their defence of the French title at Reims on August 8.
