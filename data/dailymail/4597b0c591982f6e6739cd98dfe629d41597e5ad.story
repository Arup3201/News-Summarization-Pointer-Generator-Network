Ever heard your doorbell go, dropped what you're doing rushed downstairs to open the door, only to find it’s an unwanted visitor?

That’s a scenario one London-based company hopes will be a thing of the past with their i-Bell technology, a Wi-Fi video doorbell that can connect with your smartphone or tablet.

By using a camera and connecting to the internet, the device will let you know who is at your door even if you’re out and about at work, the shops or elsewhere.

The Wi-Fi enabled i-Bell device lets people see who is at their door through the use of a 1080P camera. This can be synced to a smartphone, tablet or PC across multiple platforms and, when the bell is rung, the homeowner can see who is at their door and speak to them through their phone

To use the i-Bell, which is currently part of a Kickstarter campaign to raise £30,000 ($50,000), it is installed on your door like a normal bell and sits at face level.

Size: 110 x 60 x 22mm (3.9 x 2.4 x 0.9 inches)

Weight: 320 grams (0.7 pounds)

Camera Quality: 1080p HD

Camera field of view: 180°

Wi-Fi enabled: Yes

Battery: Internal rechargeable lithium

Audio: 2 Way audio speaker and microphone

Video: One-way (homeowner to visitor)

Other features: Cloud Storage, Voicemail

On the front is a button for visitors to activate the bell, and also a camera at the top.

When a visitor presses the button the camera springs to life and calls the device it is synced with, which can be any Android, Apple, Windows and Blackberry smartphone or tablet, and also any PC.

You can then choose to 'answer' the call with your chosen device and then speak to the person on their doorstep.

If it's a delivery, for example, the visitor could be asked to go drop it with a neighbour.

Or if it's a guest but you're out of the house they could be asked to come and meet you somewhere.

The camera isn't two-way though, so the visitor won't be able to see you.

When it is released later this year, possibly November, the product will retail for £179.50 ($307).

The i-Bell uses a 1080p HD camera and communicates with the guest via a built-in speaker and microphone.

i-Bell also allows users to screen their visitors, so they can choose whether or not to answer the door to a cold-calling salesman or an unwanted guest on the doorstep.

When someone is at the door you can chose to 'answer' the call with your chosen device  (shown) and then speak to the person on their doorstep. If it's a delivery, for example, the visitor could be asked to go drop it with a neighbour. Or if it's a guest but you're out of the house they could be asked to come and meet you

High-security brackets help to keep the gadget safe and secured to the front door, and the i-Bell can be connected to from any synced device anywhere in the world.

If you miss a call, the digital doorbell will also be able to take a picture, using the cloud to store images of people calling at your door to be checked later, while it can also record audio in the form of a voicemail.

'There’s nothing quite like i-Bell on the market right now,' said Graham Kershberg, Co-Founder of the company.

'It’s going to revolutionise daily life for a lot of individuals and businesses.

'Arranging deliveries around working hours or getting an unexpected visit from a relative who gets no answer at the door can really disrupt an individual’s plans.

'But now it’s possible to communicate directly with the person ringing the doorbell, let the postman know where to leave a package, or tell Aunt Mabel that you’ll be home as soon as possible without even being on the premises.

'Fun to use and practical, i-Bell makes it possible to answer the door from any corner of the world, whether that’s five minutes down the road on the school run or from a sun lounger overseas on a long awaited holiday.'
