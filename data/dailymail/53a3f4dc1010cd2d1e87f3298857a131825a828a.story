They are the fragments of the ancient world that have long been a bone of contention between Greece and Britain. And now the Parthenon Marbles have come under closer – and brighter focus – thanks to a clever technique that brings Athens’s revered past to life.

The Acropolis Museum – the showpiece institution which displays many of the artefacts from the famous hill that has long been the heart of the Greek capital – has announced an ambitious idea that sees it ‘colour in’ some of its key exhibits through digital technology.

Before and after: The museum is using 3D imagery to 'restore' the marbles to their original appearance

Panels from the Parthenon temple, which were once daubed in bright hues, have been ‘restored’ to their original condition via the use of 3D digital images.

Stones from the celebrated structure’s west frieze – which show a procession of pilgrims paying tribute to Athena, the Greek goddess who gave her name to the city – have been ‘resurrected’ in this manner, with flowing capes and brandished weapons.

The images have been 'scanned' onto the ancient stones to show them as they would have appeared some two-and-a-half millennia ago.

The concept is part of the celebrations for the fifth anniversary of the museum’s launch.

A striking structure of glass and concrete, the museum opened in June 2009 as a modern showcase for the treasures of the Acropolis – on whose southern slope it sits.

‘In the first five years of life, the Acropolis Museum has fulfilled our country’s high expectations,’ says Dimitros Pandermalis, the museum’s president.

‘New technologies are increasingly finding their place in the museum, and now offer essential tools to aid the understanding of the great exhibits.’

Landmark: Thanks to its lofty location, the Parthenon is visible from many corners of Athens

The museum has been regarded as a considerable success since it opened its doors, welcoming over 6.5 million people in its first half-decade – over 170,000 of them British.

Its arrival has rekindled the debate about the fate of the Elgin Marbles – panels from the Parthenon which, notoriously, are currently on show at the British Museum in London.

While the Acropolis Museum holds around half of the Great Panathenaia – the main frieze which circled the Parthenon, telling a single story about worship in the ancient city – the other half has been kept in London for over two centuries.

Striking: A temple to the Greek goddess Athena, the Parthenon was constructed in the fifth century BC

The Marbles were removed from situ between 1801 and 1812 by the British collector of antiquities Lord Elgin – nominally for their protection at a time when Greece was occupied by Ottoman Turkey.

However, the advent of the Acropolis Museum as a world-class facility on the doorsteps of the temple has amplified the calls for the Marbles to return home.

‘We comfortably welcome 3,000 visitors a day, and we are proud to have been recognised as being amongst the three best museums in the world,’ Mr Pandermalis adds.

Blast from the past: The 're-colouring' of the friezes is part of the celebrations for the museum's fifth birthday

Long viewed as one of the finest remnants of the ancient era (although it was not considered one of the original ‘Seven Wonders of the World’), the Parthenon was constructed in the fifth century BC.

It remains an Athenian landmark, visible from most corners of the city.
