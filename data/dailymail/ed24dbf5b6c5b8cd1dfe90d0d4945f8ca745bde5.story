Passing the driving test on the first attempt is an achievement most people would be proud of.

But for Latvian driver Gatis Caunitis the feat is even more remarkable as he has no arms and has to use his feet to steer the car.

The 26-year-old from Riga successfully passed his driving test and gained his full drivers license on Sunday using just his legs and feet to control the car.

Gatis Caunitis from Latvia, who has passed his driving test, despite having no legs, and having to use his feet to steer the car 

The 26-year-old from Riga uses his right foot to push the pedals as well as to put the key in the ignition to start the engine 

The only concession is that he drives a vehicle with an automatic gearbox, but apart from that he steers the car like any other driver.

He uses his left foot to steer the car, resting it on the steering wheel.

While his right foot is used to push the pedals, move the gear stick and turn on the ignition.

And even though he only uses his feet to drive, passengers who have been in the car with Mr Caunitis say his driving is absolutely safe.

He uses his left leg to steer the car, keeping his left foot on the steering wheel at all times 

Passengers who have been in the car with Mr Caunitis say his driving is absolutely safe, despite using his feet 

Even though he only uses his feet, Mr Caunitis, who was six when he lost both of his arms, passed his driving test on the first attempt 

Mr Caunitis was just six when he lost both of his arms, when he was hit by a strong electrical current after entering an unlocked electrical unit while playing hide and seek.

But that hasn't stopped him wanting to lead a normal life or wanting to learn to drive and he was lucky enough to find an instructor willing to teach him.

He explained: 'The instructor in the driving school showed no sign of surprise when he saw me. Like if it was just an ordinary situation.

The only concession is that he drives a vehicle with an automatic gearbox, but apart from that he steers the car like any other driver

'I asked him if he was afraid of driving with me, he said no.

'I passed both theory and practice in the first attempt.

'Actually, before allowing me to sit on a driver's seat, the instructor asked the Department of Transportation if there could be any claims against a disabled student.

'They said they had none.'
