A series of covert police investigations into alleged VIP paedophile rings were shut down as they went ‘to the heart of the Establishment’, officers have claimed.

Serving and former detectives have vented their fury on an internet chat forum, claiming Scotland Yard investigations into child sex abuse were ‘canned’ during the 1980s and 1990s as they closed in on powerful figures, some of whom were said to be at ‘cabinet level’.

As reported by Exaro, it comes as a senior MP said he was aware of six police probes into child sex abuse being shelved, five of which were run by Scotland Yard.

Detectives have vented their anger on an internet chat forum where they claimed investigations into child sex abuse in the 1980s and 1990s by Scotland Yard as they closed in on powerful figures were 'canned'

The extraordinary claims of a cover-up by 14 members of the forum will heap pressure on the Government and Scotland Yard, which have launched a string of probes into historic child sex abuse allegations linked to politicians. 

One ex-officer of 30 years’ service wrote: ‘Some very senior people have been habitually sexually assaulting the most vulnerable in society.

‘This is about kids being raped by those in power that included politicians of all sorts. It goes to the very heart of our Establishment.

‘There is very clear evidence that the general nature of the allegations are true.

‘There are enough officers on this site who have mentioned paedophile ops involving high-profile politicians being stopped at the eleventh hour.’

Labour MP John Mann yesterday admitted that he was aware of six inquiries which were shelved for 'no good reason'

A former detective constable said: ‘In the 90s I uncovered a middle class paedo ring at [a police station in east London]. It linked into a massive UC [undercover] paedo job which was being run by [a named detective sergeant].

‘The UC who shall remain nameless found that it went to cabinet level and four years of work was pulled overnight.’

Some of the officers also claimed there was a secret file dating back to the 1960s on a celebrity recently linked to historic abuse.

One civil servant, who said he had signed the Official Secrets Act, wrote: ‘The cover up began in 1985 when operations were closed for no apparent reason except that prominent persons were allegedly involved and again in 1990 and again over the North Wales child abuse and successive governments have continued the practice.’ The forum is open only to those who have worked in the Metropolitan Police or closely alongside the force.

The discussions surfaced in an investigation by Exaro, a news website, which was allowed access to the forum by one member. 

The claims were posted over a four-month period from July, when child protection campaigner Chris Fay, of the now-defunct National Association of Young People in Care, said a Special Branch detective held a gun to his head, telling him to stop investigating an alleged paedophile ring at Elm Guest House in south-west London.

Yesterday Labour MP John Mann said: ‘I am aware of six inquiries that were shelved for no good reason. These officers are obviously aware of more than that.

‘It’s important that they are interviewed by the police, the Home Affairs Select Committee and the national inquiry. If these officers fail to come forward it would be a dereliction of duty.’
