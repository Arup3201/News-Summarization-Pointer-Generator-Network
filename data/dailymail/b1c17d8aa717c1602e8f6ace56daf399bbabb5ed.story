Meet some of the world's rarest and adorable baby animals.

From rare river otters giving their pups swimming lessons to baby Sunda pangolin hitching a ride with its mother - these creatures are among some of the most endangered and native species to Singapore.

More than 400 baby animals were born or hatched at the Wildlife Reserves Singapore across four of its parks - Jurong Bird Park, Night Safari, River Safari and Singapore Zoo since January.

Nearly one in four babies are among the critically endangered or 'threatened' species, which includes the cotton-top tamarin, javan langur, proboscis monkey and the southern river terrapin.

Found throughout the forests of South-east Asia, the Sunda pangolins from the Night Safari is one of the most iconic and rarest creatures at the park.

Night Safari is the world’s first zoological institution to house the elusive, solitary and nocturnal creatures.

In recent years, the Sunda pangolin have been driven closer to extinction by illegal animal trafficking, habitat loss and being hunted for their meat and scales at an unsustainable level.

The rare species of javan langur, also known as an ebony leaf monkey,  features a distinctive deep orange coloured fur and can measure up to 87 centimetres in length.

Another exciting animal comes from the giant river otters at River Safari, which displays the rare species for the first time in Asia.

After their pup didn't survive in 2013, the newly parents Carlos and Carmen have become more experienced in raising their pups, while teaching them how to swim as well.

Over at Jurong Bird Park, the Goliath palm cockatoo are the largest of all cockatoo species and can grow up to 50 centimetres.

They have one of the lowest hand-rearing success rates among the parrot species due to their specialised diet.

WRS' Chief Life Sciences Officer Dr Cheng Wen-Haur said: 'Each of these births represents a precious glimmer of hope in our effort to help save the planet’s biodiversity.

'Many of them are part of coordinated conservation breeding programmes to safeguard against extinction in the wild,' he said.

'All of them are invaluable ambassadors for their species to connect our visitors to the need for their protection.'

Jurong Bird Park welcomes more than 900,000 visitors, 1.1 million at Night Safari and 1.7 million at Singapore Zoo each year.
