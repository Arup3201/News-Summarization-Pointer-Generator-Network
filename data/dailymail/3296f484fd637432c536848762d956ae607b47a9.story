Record-breaking musical Cats is to get a modern makeover complete with a rapping 'street cat' when it returns to the West End later this year.

The musical, inspired by the poems in TS Eliot’s book Old Possum’s Book Of Practical Cats, closed in London on its 21st birthday in 2002, making it the fourth longest running show in the West End.

Now, after a 12 year absence Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical is to return with a strictly limited 12 week run at the London Palladium.

Making memories: Record-breaking musical Cats is to get a modern makeover complete with a rapping 'street cat' when it returns to the West End later this year

Welcome return: Director Trevor Nunn, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and choreographer Gillian Lynne will all return for the new production

However, those hoping to relive their memories of the original show may be in for a surprise with Lloyd Webber revealing that the character of Rum Tum Tugger would become a rapping 'street cat' in the new version.

The composer said he was 'never very happy' with some parts of the show including the Rum Tum Tugger song, adding: 'I’ve come to the conclusion that having read Eliot again, maybe Eliot was the inventor of rap'. 

He said: 'The thing about the Eliot verse is that you can tell he’s American, nobody other than Eliot would have written "The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat".'

The revamped show will run at the London Palladium from December 6, reunites Lloyd Webber with the original team behind Cats including director Trevor Nunn and choreographer Gillian Lynne.

His previous show Stephen Ward The Musical, which was inspired by the 1963 Profumo Scandal, ended in March this year after a run of less than six months but Lloyd Webber said there was nothing wrong in putting on a new version of one of his old shows.

He said: 'I don’t think that is necessarily true because if you said that we wouldn’t have a lot of room for Shakespeare.'

Since its debut in 1981, Cats has been seen by more than 50 million people in more than 30 countries.

The musical, which features songs including Memory and Macavity: The Mystery Cat, ran in the West End for 21 years and 18 years on Broadway, collecting handfuls of awards, including Best Musical at both the Laurence Olivier Awards and the Tony Awards.

Lloyd Webber said there would be an announcement in September about casting, with would-be Grizabellas and Old Deuteronomys following in the footsteps of the original production's stars Elaine Paige and Brian Blessed.

Memory: Elaine Paige as Grizabella

Inspired by Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T. S. Eliot, Cats tells the story of a tribe of cats called the Jellicles as they decide which cat should ascend to the Heaviside Layer and start a new life in what is called the 'Jellicle choice'.

The cats explain to the audience that they are marking the Jellicle Ball, and that their leader Old Deuteronomy will choose one of their number to be reborn on the Heaviside Layer.

As the cats, including Jenny Anydots, Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer, introduce themselves though song, the audience meets a shabby old cat Grizabella, who is shunned by the other Jellicles.

After more songs focussing on many of the individual cats, Old Deuteronomy allows Grizabella to address the group and she is chosen to be the one to go to the Heaviside Layer.

A large tire rises from the junk piles, carrying Grizabella and Old 
Deuteronomy partway toward the sky; he then steps off so she can finish 
the journey on her own.

The songs were mostly Elliot's verse set to music, with the exception of the show's most famous piece, Memory, sung by Grizabella, which was written by Trevor Nunn. 

Set on an oversized junkyard without scene changes, the show is completely told through music with virtually no spoken dialogue in between the songs.
