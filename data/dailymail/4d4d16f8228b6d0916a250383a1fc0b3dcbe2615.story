Agony aunt: Love-struck Hannah wrote to Taylor Swift on Instagram seeking advice and was shocked when the country singer responded

Hannah, using the name 'sherbetswift', posted a picture of herself with a question: 'There’s a guy Taylor, a guy who’s sweet and charming and makes me laugh...

'A guy who I have the biggest crush in the whole wide world on, and he’ll never like me back. (And he has a girlfriend who he adores and she’s pretty and has an amazing figure and is actually nice to me)... @taylorswift can you give me some advice maybe. I love you.'

To her amazement, her music idol swiftly responded.

'Hannah. Eyes, eyes, eyes. Woah. You have 
the prettiest, widest, most child like eyes. (Composes herself) Okay. 
About this guy. I think we grow up thinking the only love that counts as
 true love is the kind that lasts forever or is fully realized. When you
 have a broken heart, the first thing a stranger will ask is ‘how long 
were you two together?’

'As if your pain can be determined by how long 
you were with someone. Or if you were with them at all. I don’t think 
that’s how it works.

'I think unrequited love is just as valid as any 
other kind. It’s just as crushing and just as thrilling. No matter what 
happens in this situation, I want you to remember that what you are 
doing is selfless and beautiful and kind.'

Swift continued: 'You are loving someone purely 
because you love them, not because you think you’ll ever have your 
affections reciprocated.

'You are admiring something for its beauty, 
without needing to own it. Feel good about being the kind of person who 
loves selflessly. I think someday you’ll find someone who loves you in 
that exact same way.'

Hannah was clearly surprised the 'Love Story' singer replied to her post, writing back, 'I feel like you’re the big sister I don’t have. Thank you, I really did need to hear that from you.'

Taylor is no stranger to heartbreak, known for penning songs about her famous past loves - and infamous breakups - including Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhaal and John Mayer.

Romantic: Some of singer Taylor Swift's songs are inspired by love and relationships

The blonde beauty has even compared music to being in a relationship, saying that discovering new artists or albums can be like anything from 'a passing fling' to finding 'the one'.

'Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to),' she wrote for the Wall Street Journal earlier this month.

'Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past.

'However, some artists will be like finding 'the one'. We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren.'
