A woman walking her dogs was astonished to see a cloud shaped just like an elephant in the sky above her head.

The 72-year-old former GP was strolling along the banks of the River Forth in Scotland near her home in Aberdour when she spotted the uncanny cumulus cloud.

Mrs Worrall, a keen amateur photographer, had been taking pictures of butterflies flitting around the wildflowers when she saw the unusually-shaped cloud.

She said: 'Every day I take my dog for a walk down at the beach on the banks of the Forth.

'On this particular day I was actually taking pictures of butterflies when I happened to look up into the sky and see this cloud.

'I had to look twice because one of the clouds looked just like an elephant.Â  Sometimes you think you see the vague outlines of animals in clouds but this was very clear.

'My house looks right over the water and I have seen some incredible cloud formations before but I've not seen anything like this.

'I don't have any special equipment, just a basic digital camera, and while I often have to edit my photos on the computer, this one was perfect.'

Cumulus clouds are a type of low-level cloud known for their puffy shapes and clearly defined edges.

They are formed at heights less than 6,500ft and often appear in clusters.
