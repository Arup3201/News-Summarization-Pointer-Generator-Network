Dressed in overalls and carrying axes, these are the women who helped the Allied forces on their way to victory during the Second World War.

The women, nicknamed the 'Lumberjills' were members of the Women's Timber Corps (WTC), whose job it was to fell trees, work in sawmills and carry out other heavy land duties.

They were recruited by the Forestry Commission and replaced the men, who had left their jobs in order to join the armed forces.

The women, nicknamed 'Lumberjills' carried out work such as felling trees, working in sawmills and driving tractors 

Home-produced timber was urgently required for industry and the war effort: for pit props and railway sleepers, telegraph poles, aircraft construction, ship-building, gunstocks for the troops, transport packaging for army supplies, charcoal for explosives and gas-mask filters – and coffins.

It was gruelling, backbreaking work - often carried out in harsh conditions - but more than 8,000 young women, some only in their mid teens, tackled it without a peep of protest.

Girls were officially recruited from the age of 17 - although some who joined were as young as 14 - and came from all kinds of backgrounds and all walks of life.

And today as the nation fell silent at 11am to mark Armistice Day, former Lumberjills up and down the country were reflecting on the wartime years with the WTC.

One of those who stopped to pause at 11am and remember her time working on the land was 91-year-old Christina Forrester.

Then 19-year-old Christina Forrester, left, signed up to join the Women's Timber Corps in 1942. Today, right, Mrs Forrester, 91, was reflecting on her time as a Lumberjill 

Mrs Forrester was just 19 when she volunteered for the Corps in 1942, when she was working in an office in Dalmarnock, Glasgow.

She was then sent to Shanford Lodge in Brechin, Angus, for a month's training where she was taught how to manually cut down trees.

After that she was then posted to Alyth in Perthshire along with two other girls who joined up at the same time.

There were 8,700 women recruited as Lumberjills during the Second World War and it was 2008 before they received any recognition for their role 

She explained: 'When I went into the WTC I didn't know what was ahead of me.

'People didn't travel much in those days and moving from the Glasgow area to Perthshire seemed far away from family and friends.

'But everyone felt the same as they came from far and wide too. We all supported each other when someone was homesick or unwell.'

But despite the tough nature of being in the WTC, Mrs Forrester says she has great memories of her time with the other Lumberjills.

She explained: 'You had to get used to being told what to do and when to do it although it wasn't too regimented. Leisure time was a Sunday and there was dancing on Friday and Saturday night.

'The girls all walked four miles to and from the dances except when Jimmy Shand was playing and we were allowed a lift, in all our finery, on the back of a lorry.

'When the camp was disbanded in 1944, two of us were kept on and had lodgings in the village of Alyth. That was luxury. It was a great part of my life with many fond memories.'

But despite their hard work, the 8,700 Lumberjills received no recognition and it was 2008 before they receive a badge acknowledging their efforts.

The Women’s Timber Corps was disbanded in August 1946, with each girl handing back her uniform and receiving a letter from Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, who was their patron.

However, in 2008 they all received badges in recognition of their efforts and a year later, many were invited to Buckingham Palace for a tea party with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

Last year then marked the final year the veterans of the Women’s Land Army and Timber Corps marched past the Cenotaph in central London on Remembrance Sunday.
