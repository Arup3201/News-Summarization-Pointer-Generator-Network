As the race to be the next London Mayor reaches its crucial final days, candidate Ken Livingstone is facing embarrassing allegations that he earned up to £1.2million over the past three years, but still used a tax loophole to save more money.

The figure is thought to be more than his rival current London Mayor Boris Johnson, was earning at some points in recent years.

It has been claimed that by funnelling his wages into his company, the Labour candidate may have paid as little as 18 per cent tax, which saved him up to £220,000, according to The Sun.

On the campaign trail: Mr Livngstone earlier today in North London. In the run up to Thursday's London Mayoral elections, it is an embarrassing revelation for Mr Livingstone, who has previously named tax avoiders as 'rich b******s'

Crucial week: Ken Livingstone walks his dog Coco as he meets voters - a poll shows Mr Johnson is beating him by 56 per cent to 44 per cent in the second round run-off

The allegations could leave the Mr Livingstone red-faced as three years ago he criticised tax avoiders, 
saying: ‘These rich b******s just don’t get it. No one should be allowed
to vote in a British election, let alone sit in Parliament, unless they
pay their full share of tax.’

The figure which emerged last night is significantly higher than the £50,000 it was previously thought he had saved  -  some of the money was earned from personal appearances, speech making and hosting a radio show.

It is an entirely legal move, but has still proved controversial.

It was paid into a personal company set up by Mr Livingstone and Emma Beal, his then partner who is now his wife.

The pair are sole shareholders in their company, Silveta Ltd.

Because Silveta is a small firm, it does not legally have to spell out its income and outgoings.

In contrast, Boris Johnson paid the top rate, which was pushed up to 50 per cent in April 2010.

Every second counts: Although it was raining when Mr Johnson left for work this morning, it had cleared up when he visited Bexleyheath this afternoon. After yesterday's gaffe when he swore live on BBC lunchtime news,  Mr Johnson was keen to impress

Silveta is a small firm, so it is not legally obligated to detail its income and outgoings.

The study of Silveta’s Companies House declarations estimates it made £1,239,000 from 2008-09 to 2010-11, reported the newspaper.

Over the three years, Conservative candidate Mr Jonhson declared £1,278,360 total earnings and paid £519,276 in tax. 

But accountants believe that Mr Livingstone managed to pay significantly less, because he was charged corporation tax.

Accountant Andrew Hamilton told The Sun the ploy had saved £65,000 in 2009-10 alone — meaning a tax rate of just 22 per cent.

Today a spokesman for Mr Livingstone defended him and said to the MailOnline : 'He has paid all his taxes. What Londoners want to know is how they will be better off, which is why he’ll be cutting fares. Boris will hike fares above inflation.'

A spokesman for Mr Johnson told the MailOnline: ‘It has taken others to expose what Ken Livingstone refused to release himself, despite promising to do so.

‘When you look at the tax rate he paid, which is so much less than the other candidates, and at the comments he has made in the past, it is no wonder he has been trying to hide the truth about his tax affairs.

‘How can Londoners trust him as Mayor when he has been caught out again saying one thing and doing another?’

The revelations angered the Taxpayers' Alliance who said:

'Livingstone is a hypocrite, he criticised tax avoiders but it seems he has now been caught out himself. He promised voters that he would publish full details of his tax affairs over three weeks ago but has yet to deliver, it’s hard to see how Londoners can trust him on any of his other promises.'

Both candidates are under pressure to
succeed from their respective parties in Thursday's elections, and yesterday Mr Johnson 
launched a foul-mouthed rant at a TV interviewer.

The
Tory incumbent, who opened up a 12-point lead in a new poll, let rip on
camera after a BBC journalist  questioned him about his links to the 
Murdoch media empire.

Time for a change? The candidates speak during a live Sky News debate at Heron Tower, London

On track? Ken is known for taking the tube in London, but could it be that Ken is no Gentleman and does not give his seat up for a lady?

In a sign of the pressure he is under, Mr Johnson described the line of questioning as ‘f****** b*******’.

He
got a major boost last night when a Populus poll for the Times showed 
him opening up a sizeable lead over his Labour rival and former mayor 
Ken Livingstone after a week in which the contest had seemed on a 
knife-edge.

The poll showed Mr Johnson beating Mr Livingstone by 56 per cent to 44 per cent in the second round run-off.

But
Mr Johnson lost his famous sense of humour after facing questions 
about attempts to secure commercial deals  with News International while
Scotland Yard was probing phone hacking by  the company.

Mr Johnson asked the Murdochs’ firm to sponsor a cross-Thames cable car in East London while he was chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority.

At the time, the force was investigating the firm over phone hacking.Mr Johnson told the BBC: ‘I don’t know of any discussions going on about that  but what I can tell you is that I think  it’s right to work with the private sector to get contributions that will be for the  benefit of London.’

He then urged the BBC to concentrate on the money he has raised during his term of office from the private sector, rather than questions raised by BBC London political editor Tim Donovan.

He said: ‘I’m very proud that over the last four years we’ve got more than £100million in sponsorship that I’ve raised for this city: £50million for the bikes, £36million for the cable car.

‘You’ve got to get this on the air! Come on, this is the most important thing. Stuff Donovan and his f****** b*******.’

The swearing was broadcast on the BBC lunchtime news.
