Would-be burglar: Fingerprints of Kevin Potts were found on an open beer can at the house he broke into

A bungling burglar who smashed into a house has been jailed after leaving fingerprints on an open can of beer at the house he was raiding.

Kevin Potts, 36, smashed the glass of an external door on the property in Sprotbrough, South Yorkshire, waking the householders who then alerted police.

Doncaster Crown Court heard that the fingerprints of Potts from Mexborough, South Yorkshire was a positive match to an open can of beer left at the house.

Potts left the house without taking anything but was arrested by police a short time later, walking and drinking a can of beer.

Pc Fahd Nassar said on Monday that burglary was an ‘incredibly intrusive and disturbing crime’.

He added that it often left the victims feeling ‘violated and no longer safe in their own home, whether anything was stolen of not’.

Potts pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison for the attempted burglary in the early hours of July 10.

He was also sentenced to an additional four months in prison for breach of a previous suspended sentence.

It comes as Jake Smith, 24, was jailed to 21 months after he tried to break into a house, completely unaware his every move was being captured on a CCTV camera positioned just inches away from his face.

He can be seen in footage trying to force open the bathroom window of a property in Wednesfield, in the West Midlands, flashing his face to the camera several times.

Smith, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, was tracked down after police released the footage of the incident and received dozens of calls from people who recognised him.

David Cameron revealed yesterday his own experience of being burgled twice as the government unveiled plans to make it easier for people to defend their homes.

The Prime Minister said the on one occasion raiders targeting his home in North Kensington in London 'loaded up my Skoda and drove off'.

He told Sky News: 'It's a horrible feeling when your house has been invaded and your privacy has been invaded and you don't know what they have taken, you don't know what they were doing.
