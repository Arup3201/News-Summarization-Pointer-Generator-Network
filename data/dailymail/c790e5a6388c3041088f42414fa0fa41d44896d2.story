Probe: Police have re-opened an investigation into the death of Princess Diana (pictured in 1990) after new evidence from Soldier N - who has now fled the country

An sniper who claims the SAS were involved in a plot to kill Princess Diana has reportedly fled to Thailand in fear of his life.

The anonymous soldier is said to be laying low in south-east Asia as police investigators probe claims that members of the Army helped cause the car crash that killed Diana in 1997.

It has been claimed that special forces agents shined a light into the eyes of Diana's driver, which led to him losing control of the car and hitting a pillar in a tunnel in Paris.

The sniper - known only as Soldier N - made the claims to police investigators, leading to the inquiry into the Princess's death being reopened.

But he fled the country before Scotland Yard could properly examine the evidence, which was handed over by the Royal Military Police, reported the Daily Star.

Previous reports had placed Soldier N in an ex-part community in Dubai, but an anonymous military source had claimed it would be a hostile - and expensive - environment for him.

The source said: 'He will not be welcome in the Middle East as there is a large community of former SAS personnel who use Dubai and other locations as a base for their work.

'It is also expensive to live in the Gulf states and I donâ€™t believe that he has the resources to sustain a new life there.'

'Those in the regiment will not be happy with his comments about Princess Diana.'

Thailand is said to be a popular destination for runaways due to its lenient police system and low cost of living.

As Soldier N has a criminal record for handling firearms, there are many countries he would not be allowed to enter.

Former Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, 84, whose son Dodi was in the car with Diana and also died, has repeatedly called for further investigation of the crash, and is said to be angry that Soldier N was not prevented from leaving the country.
