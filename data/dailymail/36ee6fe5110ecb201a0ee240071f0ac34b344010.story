Calls for help: Campaigners have called on the Duchess of Cambridge to put pressure on her favourite High Street store to better the lives of its workers

Campaigners have called on the Duchess of Cambridge to put pressure on her favourite High Street store to better the lives of its workers.

Zara has hit by a string of ‘slave labour’ scandals including the deaths last month of two workers in a Bangladeshi factory which supplies the Spanish chain.

Kate, who turns 30 on Monday, is seen regularly shopping in the chain’s branches and has worn two of its outfits on high profile public occasions since becoming a member of the royal family.

The first was a £49.99 cornflower blue dress she sported the day after her April wedding as she and Prince William left by helicopter from Buckingham Palace.

The second was a daringly short nude and black lace tulip dress she wore to a Gary Barlow charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall shortly before Christmas.

Both sold out within hours.

The publicity was a huge coup for the firm which has been heavily criticised for the standards in factories used to manufacture its clothes.

This week hundreds of workers took to the streets in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, demanding compensation for the families of victims of a blaze at the Eurotex factory in December.

Taslima Akter, 22, and Jesmin Akter, 20, were died after a boiler explosion caused staff to stampede.

The country’s National Garment Workers’ Association, partnered by British charity War On Want, are supporting the calls for redress.

Greg Muttitt, campaigns and policy director at War on Want, said: ‘Kate has been a public ambassador for the Zara brand. In contrast, she has shown no interest in the lives and conditions of the workers who make Zara’s clothes.

‘Following this tragedy, a people’s princess would insist that Zara fairly compensates the bereaved families and call on the British government to enact legislation to protect overseas workers for UK retailers.’

Zara is owned by Inditex, a family business founded in 1975 by Amancio Ortega.

The 75-year old is the richest man in Spain and ranked seventh in Forbes' billionaires list, with an estimated fortune of $31bn (£19bn). 

It is hugely popular for its mid-range priced fashion and has 1,540 stores worldwide, including 64 in the UK. 

In 2005 64 workers were killed at another Bangladeshi factory producing their clothes and questions have been raised about the conditions of its workers in Brazil.

The company was unavailable for comment yesterday due to the fact that it was a public holiday in Spain.
