Alan Curbishley has turned down an approach to make a swift return to Fulham after a wrangle over pay.

The former Charlton boss had been lined up to become Kit Symons’ new director of football at Craven Cottage.

But the two parties were unable to agree on a financial package, with Curbishley eventually declining the opportunity.

The 57-year-old was appointed as the club’s technical director in December last year while Rene Meulensteen was in charge, but was sacked in the weeks after Felix Magath landed the job.

Curbishley has taken on a number of punditry roles on television since his last managerial job at West Ham, which ended in 2009, but was keen to take on the role.

Symons is still on the hunt for more members of staff as he plots a swift return to the Premier League.

The Cottagers lie 11 points behind the play-offs after the stoppage time defeat away at rivals Brentford last Friday.

Curbishley's previous spell as technical director lasted just two months
