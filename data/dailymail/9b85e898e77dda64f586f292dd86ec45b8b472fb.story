Danny Welbeck has revealed that he was finding life at Manchester United 'difficult' before deciding to make his £16million to Arsenal.

Welbeck, who has enjoyed playing in his favoured centre forward position since joining the Gunners, often found himself playing on the wing or on the substitutes bench at Old Trafford.

Speaking to Arsenal's official website, Welbeck said: 'When you’ve been somewhere for so long and then you’re going to start a new chapter in your career, you’ve got to think about it a lot.

'Over the past year or so, I started to think about what’s best for me because at the time I was playing on the left wing a lot and in a 4–4-2, which is very difficult for me because I can’t make an impact on the game.

'You start to have thoughts but at that time you’re still going to training and I was still giving 100 per cent and giving my all in every single game – that’s just me, I’m not going to change that.

'But you do start to think about what’s best for you.'

The 23-year-old has scored 10 goals for club and country since joining Arsene Wenger's team and believes he's in the right place to further his career as a striker.

He added: 'It’s going well, it’s a great set up here and a really good environment to be in. All the players, the staff, everyone around the club – they have all welcomed me with open arms and that is very pleasing. I’m really grateful for that.'
