Moors Murderer Ian Brady has written a letter from his hospital bed describing how he believes he will die soon - but wishes he had killed himself years ago.

The notorious 77-year-old wrote the 750 word letter  from his bed at Ashworth psychiatric hospital in Merseyside.

Known as the Moors murderer, Brady tortured and killed five children with his then-girlfriend Myra Hindley,

Along with Hindley – who died in prison aged 60 in 2002 – Brady murdered Pauline Reade, 16, John Kilbride, 12, Keith Bennett, 12, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17, between 1963 and 1965.

Victims were lured to their deaths, sexually tortured then buried on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester. 

In his most recent letter, Brady still expresses no remorse for his sickening killings.

Instead he complains he is 'still bedridden and worsening' after breaking his hip and arm in fall a year ago. 

He wrote: 'This cell block is described as a "discharge ward"; I've been sitting here 30 years... and there's no turnaround of inmates unless in a coffin.

'So it's more accurately a blocked sewer-pipe!'

Brady also suggests he wishes he had taken his own life years ago.

He writes: 'Had I divined the future of spending half a century in prison and the final fifteen years being force-fed by nasal tube in an unmonitored zoological cesspit of regression, I would've exited decades ago.'

The letter to Channel 5 News correspondent Julian Druker was written before Christmas.

Terry Kilbride, whose 12 year-old brother John was snatched and murdered by Brady in November 1963, has slammed Brady's correspondence as 'crafty'.

Mr Kilbride from Ashton-under-Lyne, said: 'This letter coming through  about him not being so well and "I'm dying, I'm on my deathbed" and all this, it's just another ploy to get people to think "do we feel sorry for him?".

'Like hell they do.'

Forensic psychologist Dr Chris Cowley, who has met Brady numerous times, believes the killer may be feeling ignored by the public.

Dr Cowley said: 'Brady's a very egocentric person.

'He likes being in the limelight. I think probably at this point in time he's a little bit frightened that people aren't remembering him and people have maybe forgotten about him.' 

Taxpayers have forked out more than £14 million on Brady since he was convicted nearly 50 years ago.

The Moors murderer has racked up the costs of his keep by staging a 15-year hunger strike and a series of failed legal challenges - for which he has relied on legal aid.

Relatives of the five children murdered by Brady and Myra Hindley in the 1960s have said the money would be better spent tracing the remains of victim Keith Bennett, the location of which Brady refuses to reveal.
