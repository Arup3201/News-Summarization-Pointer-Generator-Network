Two British brothers were lured to fight for Isis in Syria by playing the video war game Call of Duty, their father claims.

Ahmed Muthana claims his sons Nasser, 20, and Aseel, 17, were given a copy of the game by extremists in a bid to groom them with violent fantasies.

The game, commonly referred to as CoD, is a first-person experience of warfare. In one version, players massacre civilians to infiltrate a separatist movement in the Middle East led by a leader named 'Al-Asad'.

Now, the Cardiff-born boys have joined the jihadist faction in Syria - and Mr Muthana believes the game manipulated them.

Last month, Nasser was one of four British Isis members who took to YouTube promoting their activities. 

In a chilling online message, the former medical student unveiled a photograph of what is thought to be a collection of improvised explosive devices or IEDs. Underneath the image, he wrote: 'So the UK is afraid I come back with the skills I’ve gained.'

He also wrote about decapitating his enemies alongside a picture of a chain-like weapon. 

And Aseel has proclaimed his support for Sharia law online.

Distraught, their father claims he had always refused to buy them violent video games for fear it would affect them - and he is certain Call of Duty was used to groom them. 

Mr Muthana, 57, told The Sun: 'I believe the game was bought for them by the same people who encouraged them to go to Syria.'

His claims come after British jihadist Abu Sumayyah al-Britani compared their sieges to CoD.

The father-of-three boasted that life with ISIS, who have taken control of parts of Syria and Iraq, is 'really, really fun' and 'better than that game Call of Duty.'

Psychologists warned this year that violent video games stunt the 'moral maturity' of teenagers.

Brock University in Ontario found adolescents who immerse themselves in these games are losing their sense of 'right' and 'wrong'.

Warning: Psychologists have warned violent video games make adolescents feel they can 'play God'

They also lure players into believed they can 'play God', another study found.

First-person shooters, they say, are very effective at giving players the sense that they’re totally in control of their environment and destiny.

The consequences of shooting the enemy, for example, becomes apparent very quickly – and this gives gamers the thrill of being effective.

That shoot-em-ups give gamers an enticing sense of control is something that has been underscored by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Lennart Nacke, the director of the Games and Media Entertainment Research Laboratory at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology.

But there are other factors in play, such as the rewarding feeling of making decisions.

Mr Nacke told The New Yorker: ‘Video games are essentially about decision-making. First-person shooters put these tasks on speed. What might be a very simple decision if you have all the time in the world becomes much more attractive and complex when you have to do it split second.’

Violent games also give users an adrenaline rush that men used to get from fighting wild animals.

Nacke added: ‘If you look at it in terms of our evolution, most of us have office jobs. We’re in front of the computer all day. We don’t have to go out and fight a tiger or a bear to find our dinner.

‘But it’s still hardwired in humans. Our brain craves this kind of interaction, our brain wants to be stimulated. We miss this adrenaline-generating decision-making.’
