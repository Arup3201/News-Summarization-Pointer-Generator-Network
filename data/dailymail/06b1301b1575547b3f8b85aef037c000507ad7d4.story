A teacher stole more than £22,000 from his own wife just months after marrying her - in order to fund his gambling addiction.

Timothy Jones, of Burntwood, Staffordshire, has been jailed after plundering the bank account of his new bride Jo, 41, by using two of her credit cards behind her back.

She only found out about the fraud when she gave him a hug and felt a large roll of banknotes in his back pocket, a court heard.

With her suspicions aroused, she then tried to check her bank account while out shopping in December last year and found a balance of just £91.

Her 48-year-old husband had also changed all her online passwords in order to pocket her hard-earned cash, Staffordshire Crown Court was told.

Heartbroken Mrs Jones, a primary school teacher, then confronted her husband who came clean about his addiction to gambling at the bookies on gaming machines.

Now he is waking up behind bars after admitting three charges of making false representations.

Sentencing him to eight months in prison Recorder Professor Martin Wasik said: 'It gives me no pleasure sending a man like you to jail but it is the breach of trust which makes this so serious.

'When you first met her you already had problems.

'You were unable to address that problem and the issue continued throughout the time you were in the relationship.'

Prosecuting Neil Ahuja said the total defrauded from Mrs Jones was £22,251.

This included £7,692 from her bank account, £6,543 on one credit card and more than £8,000 on another.

The couple’s relationship started in 2009 after they met at a theatrical group, but they did not marry until the summer last year.

Mrs Jones was the breadwinner for the family while her husband studied on a college teaching course and looked after the household, the court was told.

But Jones was caught out last December when his wife was hugging him and noticed banknotes in his pocket after he had come back from the shops.

She then tried to access her bank account online and her password was not recognised.

Whilst they were Christmas shopping in Tamworth, Staffordshire days later, she manually checked her account and found just £91 in it.

The defendant then ‘drip fed’ confessions to his wife about his gambling problems and she tried to persuade him to hand himself in.

Mrs Jones eventually contacted police after her husband threatened to kill himself and he was arrested at their £200,000 home.

When questioned, he told officers he had a gambling problem with gaming machines and betting shops which was out of control.

Defending Paul Lamb said the couple were no longer together following the revelations about his addiction.

He added: 'He has shown a great deal of regret and remorse for the distress and difficulties he has inflicted on his now estranged wife and step children.'

Jones’ career as a teacher is also now in ruins following the conviction.

He had obtained a degree and a teaching qualification and was employed as a supply teacher when he was arrested.
