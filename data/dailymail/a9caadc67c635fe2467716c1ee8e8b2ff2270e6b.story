Target: The email, whose recipients were mostly Asian and female, also said that Facebook founder and Harvard alum Mark Zuckerberg (seen above with wife Priscilla) would be killed as well

The sender also claims they are going to kill Harvard alum and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

'Email threat sent to predominantly Asian female undergrads at Harvard College. Be careful ladies,' wrote student Phebe Hong on Twitter, who shared a grab of the letter she received.

All students at Harvard.

My name is Stephanie Nguyen.

I live in Boston.

I will come tomorrow in Harvard University and shoot all of you each one of you all Harvard students, I will kill you individually.

I'll be back tomorrow at 11 o'clock in your fuc*ing university and will kill you, you sons of bitches.

Even Mark Zuckerberg of facebook I willl kill

I'm going to kill every one of you

I promise you, slit-eyes 

In one email the sender goes by the name of Stephanie Nguyen.

In others the name is Eduardo Nguyen and Huy Dinh. 

'At this time the campus remains open and operations have not been curtailed,' wrote Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano in an advisory message to students last night.

That being said, at least one major event was cancelled for safety reasons.

The Harvard Crimson reports that after meeting with campus police, members of the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association decided to postpone an event on the Asian American experience at Harvard scheduled for later today.

'To all of our dear friends who received this afternoon’s email, we express our sincerest sympathy and support,' organizers wrote in an email announcing the cancellation. 

'No one should have to open their inbox and see a such a threatening and racially charged message.' 

Under control: The university reached out to the FBI, although one group cancelled an event scheduled for today as a safety precaution 

Famous face: Among the many alums of Harvard, one of the nation's best schools, is actress Natalie Portman (above)

More famous faces: Actor Matt Damon also attended Harvard, writing Good Will Hunting with pal Ben Affleck (above) shortly after dropping out just 12 credits shy of graduating 

The university has reached out to the FBI as they try to find the person or persons responsible for this threat. 

In addition to Zuckerberg, famous alums at the Ivy League university, considered one of the best in the nation, include actors Natalie Portman and Matt Damon, President Barack Obama and Chief Justice John Roberts.
