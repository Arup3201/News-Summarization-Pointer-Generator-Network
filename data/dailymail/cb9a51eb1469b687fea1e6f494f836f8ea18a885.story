Plans by the health watchdog to allow relatives to spy on poor care homes have been branded an ‘admission of failure.’

The Care Quality Commission will this month publish guidelines setting out how families can place hidden cameras in the rooms of their loved ones if they suspect abuse.

It follows several harrowing cases that were only uncovered by relatives or whistleblowers taking matters into their own hands and secretly filming the treatment of carers.

But critics say the CQC is not doing enough to monitor care standards, while the care home industry says it is unacceptable for filming to be encouraged.

The watchdog insists covert filming should be used only as a last resort after families have raised concerns with it and with care home managers.

But Stephen Burke, chief executive of the Good Care Guide, a TripAdvisor-style website for care homes, said: ‘The fact that the CQC are sanctioning people to undertake secret filming suggests that the system is not working. That’s a huge admission of its own failings as an inspector of care.

‘We would expect the CQC to pay much more attention to what families are saying. If the families are flagging up that there a problem, a worry, serious concern, we would expect the CQC to be in there... and tackle the early signs of poor care before it’s too late.

‘The key to improving care is not by introducing a Big Brother-style culture but to ensure the industry is well inspected, regulated and staff are properly trained, supervised and managed while punishing those who provide inadequate care.’

Professor Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, which represents private care homes said: ‘It’s unacceptable to give the green light for people to do covert filming. Where is the choice of the older person in all that? I’m at a loss as to why the regulator is coming out with this as a position.’

In 2012, the family of Gladys Wright, 79, secretly filmed carers pushing her and swearing at her at a £800-a-week home in Somerset. One employee was later jailed.

The family of 92-year-old Bridget Rees, suspicious after noticing bruises on her arms and legs, secretly filmed a carer throwing objects at her face, poking her, slapping her and swearing at her at a North London nursing home.

As a result, Faderera Grace Bello was jailed for four months in June.

And in April, BBC1’s Panorama secretly filmed staff ignoring the cries of a 98-year-old woman while another was seen being slapped. It resulted in seven staff being sacked from the home in Essex.

The CQC guidelines, to be published this month, will also set out how managers can covertly film staff they suspect of abuse.

Andrea Sutcliffe, CQC chief inspector of adult social care, said providers and relatives will be advised what issues they need to take into account when filming, adding: ‘Respecting the dignity of people is central.’

The CQC has just begun tough new inspections of all 25,000 care homes and home help services in England. Teams of three or four inspectors will give an Ofsted-style rating from outstanding to poor.

It follows several high-profile scandals, including the shocking abuse of adults at Winterbourne View in Bristol, exposed by a Panorama investigation in 2011. The CQC had passed the home as safe and ignored the concerns of a whistleblower.

It also gave Furness General Hospital in Cumbria a clean bill of health in 2010, even though up to 14 women and two babies are feared to have died needlessly in the past decade.

It emerged that the CQC’s former chief executive, Cynthia Bower, and chair, Jill Finney, tried to cover up a failed inspection although both deny the claims.
