It may be 65 years old but classic It's A Wonderful Life has beaten all its modern rivals to be nominated Britain's favourite Christmas film.

The 1946 movie, which stars James Stewart as George Bailey a man who plans to kill himself on Christmas Eve until a guardian angel intervenes, picked up almost a fifth of the 3,000 votes cast.

The online poll, carried out by www.radiotimes.com, longlisted 50 films set on or around Christmas and asked people to pick their favourite.

Golden oldie: It's A Wonderful Life from 1947 starring James Stewart and Donna Reed has been voted Britain's favourite Christmas film

The second most popular was The Muppet Christmas Carol which picked up 10 per cent of votes, followed by the Richard Curtis film Love Actually.

A slightly less obvious choice was Die Hard which took eighth place. The film, which stars Bruce Willis as off-duty cop John McClane battling a building full of criminals on Christmas Eve, took 4 per cent of the vote.

Romantic: Love Actually starring Bill Nighy came in at number three

Radio Times film editor Andrew 
Collins said: 'As it is the season to be jolly, I won't disguise my 
rosy-cheeked joy that the poll named Die Hard one of the top 10 
Christmas movies of all time.

'Die
Hard may come up short in terms of snowfall, but it earns its place. A 
high-octane, 18-certificate hostage thriller whose publicity features a 
perspiring man in a white vest, it was not exactly marketed as a festive
family treat, and in any case, arrived in cinemas in July 1988 in 
America and February 1989 here.

Tinseltown's finest: Elf starring Will Ferrel and Home Alone with Macaulay Culkin came in fourth and fifth respectively

'But, set on Christmas Eve, it's just as capable of producing festive tingles as the more traditional, December released Muppet Christmas Carol or the cocklewarming Love Actually, which was literally giftwrapped in 2003 with a lovely red ribbon tied around its twinkling poster image.

'Meanwhile, I'm dreaming of a white-vested Christmas, specifically Alan Rickman's master thief in Die Hard, Hans Gruber, deadpanning the phrase 'Ho, ho, ho'.'
