Daniel Agger has revealed he will consider his Liverpool future if he's not in boss Brendan Rodgers' first-team plans next season.

The 29-year-old endured a frustrating campaign at Anfield last year, often filling in as cover for Rodgers' preferred centre-back partnership of Mamadou Sakho and Martin Skrtel.

Frustrated figure: Agger (bottom) made only 20 Premier League appearances for Liverpool last season

The Denmark international made only 20 Premier League appearances as the Reds finished second at the end of the 2013/14 campaign, and has warned he may seek a move away from Merseyside if his first-team prospects don't improve.

'It is no secret that I had problems last season and I am considering things,' he reportedly told a Danish newspaper.

'How things turned out last season is not acceptable for me.

'I am here now and it is up to me to show the coach that I should play.'
