When this hungry elephant realised that the only way was up, he refused to let his lack of physical height stop him from getting his lunch.

The bull elephant was caught on camera standing on its hind legs, half-climbing up against a tree to reach the leaves up top.

He looked more like a giraffe than an elephant as he stretched his trunk towards the succulent leaves in the tree.

Stretching out: This bull elephant is not afraid to go that one extra mile to get what he wants

Giovanni Casini, 35, from Pisa, Italy took these stunning pictures in Mana Pools Park, in the north of Zimbabwe.

Mr Casini, who is currently living in South Africa, started taking pictures as a hobby four years ago but he was amazed to catch this hungry elephant on camera, acting just like a giraffe.

Mr Casini said: 'It was dawn, the forest was silent, the air full of dust and my three friends and I were alone. 

'All of a sudden we saw the bull elephant and we followed him for a while.

Faraway food: The elephant has his eye on the leaves at the top of the tree and starts to climb towards it

Success: The elephant grabs hold of one branch, left, and holds on tight to take it back down, right

'Suddenly, he was up on his hind legs and it was quite a show to see a creature as massive as this standing on the back legs and pulling away an entire brance with his trunk like it was nothing.

'It is very rare for elephants to stand on their back legs because of their weight.

'I think it is really amusing and quite impressive to see have seen the elephant standing on its back legs and reaching up like a giraffe.

'The elephant was straining for food because it is the dry season and low vegetation is scarce.'
