A humorous engagement photo featuring a group of University of Tennessee students in Knoxville went viral on Friday.

Senior Megan Jones, who pretends to hold a gun up to her head next to her wedding ring wearing friends, has since spoken out about being the only girl not smiling.

'I'm forever the red vest girl,' said Jones of her funny expression in a photo taken at a Christmas party at the university last Tuesday.

'It just happened. We snapped the photo and I threw that face, and the Internet did its due diligence,' Jones told wkm.com.

After the photo appeared on facebook, reddit user moth_ladder posted the photo beneath the thread entitled 'Engagement Season.'

The photo got over 3,000 comments and made 'red vest girl' an overnight online celebrity with a string of like-minded admirers.

'As the only single person in my group of friends, red vest, you are my hero,' said Reddit user Burtongirl.

'As a recently married man, I married the type in the red vest. That's the type you want,' said Reddit user thatburntdude.

'I want to marry one of them. You know which one I'm talking about,' said GodIsDeadLongLiveDog.

Those are just a few of the comments beneath a picture of 12 girls, 11 of whom are smiling, three of whom are engaged, and one whom is famously pouting in a red vest.

'Somebody called me the enemy of love, which is great,' Jones said to Wate.com.

'I think he thinks it's pretty much the coolest thing to ever happen,' Jones said of her boyfriend.

'We all have this sense of humor and have been taking engagement photos a lot lately...when everyone went for that pose I just went for another one and it ended up being that one,' Jones said in an interview with Huff Post live.

'Enjoy being single but enjoy your engaged friends,' she continued.

Jones talked to Huff Post about 'engagement season,'and about how one minute everyone is single and the next, everyone's engaged. Producers on Huff Post and social media users across the world have deemed Jones a 'national hero.'
