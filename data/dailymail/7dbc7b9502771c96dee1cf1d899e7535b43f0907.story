Earlier this week it was reported Kelly Brook allegedly shelled out for her own rock following a proposal from her ex-Gladiator boyfriend, David McIntosh.

And while getting engaged is meant to be one of - if not the - most romantic moments of a woman’s life, it seems Ms Brook is part of a growing trend.

Increasing numbers of women are apparently just as concerned with the quality of the ring as the proposal itself with one in five (21 per cent) having purchased their own bling.

Kelly Brook may have paid for her own engagement ring following David McIntosh's proposal, according to reports

It seems purchasing jewellery to celebrate an engagement is no longer seen as the sole responsibility of the husband-to-be, but instead something which should be shared between couples.

Over half of the UK’s unmarried ladies (54 per cent) said they would willingly contribute – no doubt to ease what is increasingly seen as a financial burden in addition to the actual wedding itself.

In line with more traditional values, those over the age of 55 years (65 per cent) would be less willing to pay for a ring, but for the younger, unmarried audience (18-24 years) it’s not something they’re opposed to – a quarter don’t see it as a problem.

One in five women (6 million British females) now pay for their own engagement ring

Purchasing a ring is no longer seen as the sole responsibility of man, but instead something which should be shared between couples

And for the slightly older bracket (35-44 years) - in particular those who’ve not yet been down the aisle - a third would happily pay for their own sparkler.

1. Wrexham – 43%

2. Cambridge – 38%

3.  Bristol – 37%

4. Aberdeen – 33%

5. Aberystwyth – 32%

6. Leeds – 31%

7. Edinburgh – 27%

8. Sheffield – 25%

9. London – 24%

Commenting on the findings, Joanna Mansbridge, Head of Jewellery Buying at QVC, who conducted the survey, said: ‘We live in a modern world where women today are making their own money.

‘It's no longer a man's stressful responsibility to choose the perfect ring and pay for it alone – these findings show ladies are more than happy to contribute and actually enjoy the selection process.

'Why risk so much money on something they may not even like!

'If a man still feels he wants a traditional proposal – down on one knee with a ring on offer – why not choose a replica version first that looks the real deal but won't break the bank and then have the fun of shopping together for the official one.’
