The disgraced Rutgers men's basketball coach - who was fired after a video emerged of him hitting players with basketballs and gay slurs - has said he is an 'embarrassment to his family.'

Mike Rice was fired this morning, just one day after massive public outcry surrounding a video that showed him pushing, kicking and spewing homophobic remarks at his players.

The university said in a statement today: 'Based upon recently revealed information and a review of previously discovered issues, Rutgers has terminated the contract of Mike Rice.'

Tim Pernetti, the Rutgers athletic 
director - who yesterday defended his decision to suspend and not fire Rice - has admitted that he made the wrong move.

Pernetti said: 'I am responsible for 
the decision to attempt a rehabilitation of Coach Rice.

'Dismissal and 
corrective action were debated in December and I thought it was in the 
best interest of everyone to rehabilitate, but I was wrong.'

He added: 'Moving forward, I will work to regain the trust of the Rutgers community.'

Speaking to WABC-TV outside his home today, Rice said there is 'no excuse' for his behavior in the video, and apologized for his actions.

He told the station: I've let so many people down, my players, my administration, Rutgers University, the fans, my family - who's sitting in their house, just huddled around because of the fact that their father was an embarrassment to them. It's troubling, but I hope at some time, maybe I'll try and explain it.

'But right now, there's no explanation for what's on those films, because there's no excuse for it. I was wrong. And I want to tell everybody who's believed in me that I'm deeply sorry for the pain and the hardship that I've caused.'

Facing the media: Rice spoke to reporters outside his New Jersey home on Wednesday after it was learned that he had been fired

Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You're a f***ing f****t!' 

The clip, obtained and released by ESPN yesterday, shows a number of disturbing and violent actions taken by Rice toward his players during team practices.

At one point on the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You’re a f***ing f****t!'

And his rants were not just limited to the verbal.

The footage shows Rice grabbing, kicking and shoving players - and even hurling basketballs at them.

Fired: Rice was let go by Rutgers amid a public outcry surrounding the release of the video yesterday

The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012.

Murdock, a former college standout 
who played with teams like the Utah Jazz and 
New Jersey (now Brooklyn) Nets, was hired by Rutgers in 2010 as director
of player development.

He told ESPN that it wasn't long before he reported Rice's aggressive behavior to Pernetti.

But Rice was not disciplined until Murdock showed him the footage in November.

A month later, Rice was suspended for three games without pay and fined $50,000 for what was described as inappropriate behavior and language.

Rice returned to his duties as head coach in a game on January 2 against Syracuse.

Pernetti said in an interview with 
ESPN yesterday that he issued the suspension and the fine after he was shown the 
tape and conducted an investigation into the matter.

He said that Rice was penalized appropriately for a 'first offense.'

Pernetti nor director of athletic communications Kevin Lorincz returned messages from MailOnline for comment.

When asked about the suspension at the time, Pernetti said: 'I was made aware of some things within the last couple of weeks. We commenced a thorough, lengthy and fair investigation and this was the result of that investigation.

'There was obviously some things that are not to the Rutgers' standard that we evaluated and decided upon.'

Criticism: As the clip has spread, it has drawn a rebuke from many on social media, including NBA superstar LeBron James

In an interview with WFAN, Pernetti said
university president Robert Barchi saw the tape and concurred with his 
actions against Rice.

After ESPN aired the videotape yesterday, a flood of anger swirled on social media with many lambasting Rutgers, including NBA superstar LeBron James and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie.

After the decision was announced today, Gov Christie posted a series of tweets supporting the decision to fire Rice.

He said: 'It was the right & necessary action to take in light of the conduct displayed on the videotape.'

Murdock stayed with the team for two years until July 2012, when his contract was not renewed.

Murdock claims he was fired after he reported Rice’s antics, a claim Pernetti denies.

His attorney Raj Gadhok told ESPN: 'Mr Murdock was terminated for having complained of and reported illegal conduct by Mike Rice. As a result, his employment was terminated by Rutgers University.

'That’s unlawful in the state of New Jersey and Eric intends to pursue legal action for his wrongful termination, which he university and its representatives had been aware of for some time now.'
