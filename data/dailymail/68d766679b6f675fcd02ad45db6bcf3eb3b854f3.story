A 26-year-old Boro Taxi driver was arraigned Tuesday on rape and robbery charges after it emerged that the suspect had allegedly told police the sex was consensual. 

Esa Alusaimi was taken into custody early Monday morning for allegedly raping a 33-year-old woman in the back of his green outer borough cab.

Alusaimi was ordered held on $100,000 bail after being charged with first-degree rape and criminal sex act, sexual misconduct, unlawful imprisonment, petit larceny and sexual abuse.  

According to the alleged victim, who is not being named due to the nature of the crime, her nightmare began late Sunday night when she called a car service to pick her up from a friend's house to take her home, but the livery cab did not show up on time.

Dangerous ride: A 33-year-old Brooklyn woman got into the back of a green Boro Taxi Sunday night asking the driver to take her home. Instead, she was left stranded in the middle of the street after being raped and robbed 

After waiting for 15 minutes, the 33-year-old saw a green Boro Taxi pull up and the driver asked if she needed to go somewhere.

'I thought everything was normal, got in, told him where I was going,' the woman told the New York Daily News in an exclusive interview.

For the passenger, the first red flag went up when she tried to swipe her credit card but was told by Alusaimi his machine was out of service.

The woman told the cabbie she had $20 in cash on her, which he said would be enough to cover the fare.

The second red flag was when the driver started to ask her personal questions.

The woman, however, became alarmed when out of nowhere Alusaimi turned the conversation to his penis.

A moment later, the green cab pulled over on a deserted street and the 26-year-old allegedly turned to the woman in the backseat and informed her the doors were locked.

According to the 33-year-old, Esa Alusaimi then climbed into the backseat, 'violently' forced her to perform oral sex on him and then raped her.

The passenger, who is a lesbian, said the experience was especially traumatic because she had not been with a man in over a decade.

 

Following the assault, the driver calmly got back behind the wheel and drove off.

The passenger asked him to take her home, but instead Alusaimi pulled over, told her to get out of the car and handed her $10 asking her to buy him a pack of cigarettes.

The woman complied thinking she could run away, unaware that her bag was still in the back of the cab.

By the time she realized what was happening, Alusaimi was gone, along with her personal belongings, leaving his alleged victim stranded in the middle of the street.

The 33-year-old, however, still had her phone with her and was able to call 911 at the urging of a friend, with whom she had been exchanging text messages.

What the woman did not know was that police had pulled over Alusaimi in Carol Gardens for running a red light.

An NYPD spokeswoman told the Daily Mail Tuesday that Esa Alusaimi was stopped at around 12.50am at the corner of Hicks and Unions streets for committing a traffic violation.

The arresting officer noticed the 26-year-old cabbie was acting 'nervous' and questioned him.

Tall tale: When Alusaimi was picked up by police for running a red light, he tried to talk his way out of the situation by saying that he was in a hurry to return a passenger's property to the 76th Precinct 

Alusaimi said he ran the red light because he was in a hurry to bring property belonging to a passenger to the nearby 76th Precinct.

However, police soon discovered that Alusaimi matched the description of a suspect in a robbery and a criminal sexual act.

Meanwhile, the 33-year-old victim was taken to Kings County Hospital for an evaluation before being taken to the precinct, where she was able to pick out her suspected attacker from a police lineup.

During questioning about the alleged rape, Alusaimi reportedly claimed, 'she wanted it.' He then described in graphic detail his sexual encounter with the passenger.

Speaking to the paper Tuesday, the 33-year-old victim was outraged by her alleged attacker's allegations, which she dismissed as a 'cliche' rape defense, adding that she felt sick to her stomach.

Her hope is that the green Boro Taxis, first introduced in 2013 to serve the outer boroughs and Manhattan north of East 96th and West 110th streets, will follow the example of yellow cabs and come equipped with a glass partition separating the driver from the passenger.
