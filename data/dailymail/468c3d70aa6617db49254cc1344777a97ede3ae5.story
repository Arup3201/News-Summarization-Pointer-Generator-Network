Survey: Around 1.5% of the population say they are lesbian or gay, according to a study by the Office for National Statistics

Only one in 100 people say they are exclusively homosexual, an official survey found yesterday.(Thurs) It said that 545,000 adults, 1.1 per cent of the population, say they are lesbian or gay.

A further 220,000, 0.4 per cent of adults, say they are bisexual.

The count by the Office for National Statistics shows that despite the promotion of same-sex marriage and full gay equality by David Cameron and the Coalition, there has been no increase in the past year in numbers of people who say they are gay.

The 1.5 per cent ONS estimate of the lesbian, gay and bisexual population is a quarter of the level of around six per cent claimed by gay lobby groups and accepted in Whitehall.

The ONS figures, described as experimental, were produced from questions on sexual identity included in the large-scale Integrated Household Survey. Nearly 170,000 people answered questions on their sexuality.

The self-acknowledged gay population, according to the estimates, is the same as last year and slightly up on numbers produced by similar surveys in 2010.

According to the findings, 1.5 per cent of men say they are gay and 0.7 per cent of women identify themselves as lesbian.

There was no answer to the sexual identity questions from 1.1 per cent of those surveyed; 3.6 per cent refused to answer or said they didn't know; 0.3 per cent described their sexuality as 'other'; and 93.5 per cent described themselves as heterosexual or straight.

Younger people were more likely to say they were gay, with 1.7 per cent of those aged between 16 and 24 calling themselves gay or lesbian, and another one per cent of the 16-24 age group said they were bisexual.

The ONS report found that London had the highest proportion of people saying they were gay, lesbian or bisexual, but even so they remained a small minority at 2.5 per cent, one in 40 of the population.

'The proportions of adults identifying themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual within the other regions were largely similar in 2012,' the report said, 'ranging from 1.0 per cent in the East of England to 1.7 per cent in the North East.'
