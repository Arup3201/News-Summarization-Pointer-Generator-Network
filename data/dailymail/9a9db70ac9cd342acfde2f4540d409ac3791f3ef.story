She might have found fame on The Only Way Is Essex but Lauren Pope, 32, is proving to be a serious force to be reckoned with in the business world.

The TOWIE star has seen her clothing line and hair extension brand go from strength to strength in recent months and has even won herself some celebrity fans.

Indeed, so popular has her Hair Rehab London business become that even style queen Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has been spotted wearing her extensions on The X Factor.

Business brains: Lauren Pope shot to fame on TOWIE but has been running Hair Rehab London since 2007 and now she's modelling her new range of extensions, which she wears herself every single day

Contrary to popular belief, Ms Pope's business career began in 2007 and while she admits her time on the ITV  show has given it a boost, her success isn't entirely down to TOWIE.

'It's my baby, it has been from day one,' she told MailOnline. 'My dad and my best friend are my two sidekicks in the company as I need people I can trust to run it when I have so much going on. 

'All the ideas come from my head and they're trend-led.'

Having noted the current trend for plaits and slick ponytails, she has unveiled a magnetic snap-on hair piece to meet demand - and Little Mix and Cheryl can't get enough of her hair. 

The next celebrity on her hit-list is Blake Lively, who she'd love to see wearing her pieces.

One business venture that has clearly come as a result of her stint on TOWIE is the 32-year-old's clothing collection for In The Style.

'All the girls on the show get offered stuff all the time but I am very selective about what I do. I want my projects to be things I am passionate about and be able to be proud of them,' she explained.

Influential: New research revealed that Lauren is more influential in the style stakes than golden girl of style, the Duchess of Cambridge, which she says is 'mad'

Ms Pope, who describes her personal style as 'tailored with a glamorous edge', recently unveiled her AW14 range for the e-tailer and is already working on SS15.

Taking inspiration from Nicole Richie, who she says works that 'sexy, boho grunge' look to perfection, Lauren is keen to build on brand Pope.

And it seems that the fashion industry is taking her seriously after new research revealed that she is more influential in the style stakes than the Duchess of Cambridge.

According to Jeetendr Sehdev, a celebrity branding expert and University of Southern California marketing professor, reality TV stars such as Lauren and Made In Chelsea's Binky Felstead have greater influence when it comes to fashion than the former Kate Middleton.

'Oh my gosh, that was mad!,' said Ms Pope of the news. 'It's so funny but great because fashion is one of my hobbies and influences my work.'

Good place: Lauren, who is currently filming for the show's Christmas episode, says she is happy now that she's made up with Chloe and has nothing to stress about

In between her fashion and beauty duties, she spends most weekends DJ-ing and is currently filming for the TOWIE Christmas special.

'I'm not sure what will happen in the show but I'm in a nice place. I've made up with Chloe and I have nothing to stress about.'

She is also rooting for co-star Gemma Collins as she takes on the witchetty grubs and cockroaches of Australia in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.

'I have been crying with laughter at her,' she beams. 'She just delivers everything so bluntly. She's coming across really well and I think she will turn a corner.'

Much, it has to be said, like Lauren Pope herself.
