'Inappropriate': The X Factor was embroiled in yet another sleaze row yesterday after a raunchy performance by controversial singer Lady Gaga prompted hundreds of complaints

The X Factor is embroiled in yet another sleaze row after a raunchy performance by Lady Gaga prompted hundreds of complaints.

The controversial singer stripped to her underwear and danced provocatively across the stage in a pre-watershed results programme watched by nearly a million children on Sunday night.

Outraged parents said her display was ‘completely inappropriate for a family show’, and campaigners called for Ofcom to take tough action against ITV for allowing it to be shown on air.

Vivienne Pattison, director of pressure group Mediawatch UK, accused the broadcasting regulator of being too lenient on similar performances in the past.

She said: ‘The X Factor are doing everything they can to keep their ratings up. I don’t think things like this should be in TV. It is damaging to the children who watch the show. It tells children, particularly young girls, “This is what you have to do if you want to make it in the music industry”. The biggest stars are always shown taking their clothes off.’

Lady GaGa, 27 – whose real name is Stefani Germanotta – appeared on stage wearing flesh coloured pants, a bra covered with white shells and a blonde wig.

Supported by ten scantily clad backing dancers, she performed her new single Venus while writhing around on stage.

Ditching her wig and the shells, she then began rubbing her hands over her torso as she repeatedly sang ‘Do what you want with my body’.

The routine ended with her crawling across the stage and onto a piano, where she remained for a post-performance interview with host Dermot O’Leary.

Ofcom said it had received more than 100 complaints yesterday and is currently assessing whether to launch a full investigation.

Another 60 viewers complained directly to ITV after Lady Gaga’s provocative routine was aired at 8.30pm, before the 9pm watershed.

Miss Pattison said: ‘Even if it doesn’t break the letter of Ofcom’s rules, it certainly breaks the spirit. Ofcom have let things like this go unpunished so many times in the past, they have single-handedly redefined what is acceptable on TV.

‘People say it is up to parents to protect their children. But that is becoming increasingly difficult. You’d have to live in a bubble to avoid it.’

Many viewers were appalled at the exhibition. Of a total audience of 8.8million, an estimated 975,000 were children under 16.

Writing on Twitter, Matthew McCaw wrote: ‘Lady Gaga’s song choice was completely inappropriate for a family show.’

Steve Thomas added: ‘What was she thinking wearing next to nothing on a family show?’

Stripped: The routine, which included Gaga rubbing her hands over her body as she sang 'Do what you want with my body', ended with her crawling across the stage and onto a piano

Complaints: Ofcom said it had received more than 100 complaints about Lady Gaga's performance, in which she was supported by ten scantily clad backing dancers

Despite the public outcry, X Factor judges Sharon Osbourne, Nicole Scherzinger, Louis Walsh and Gary Barlow seemed delighted with Lady Gaga’s performance and gave her a standing ovation.

Mrs Osbourne – who had witnessed the star strip completely naked at London club G-A-Y the previous evening – gave her a hug and proclaimed: ‘This truly is a goddess’.

It is the latest in a long line of provocative performances by pop stars on ITV’s flagship reality shows.In May, the channel was attacked for allowing US star Jennifer Lopez perform in a skimpy thong during a Britain’s Got Talent results show.

Outrage: Christina Aguilera courted controversy when she performed on the X Factor in a bra top and skimpy pants, prompting Ofcom to say the routine was 'at the very margin of acceptability'

And in 2010, singers Rihanna and Christina Aguilera provoked outrage when they performed on the X Factor in bra tops and skimpy pants.

At the time, Ofcom was criticised for saying the performances were ‘at the very margin of acceptability.’

An ITV spokesman defended Lady Gaga’s routine yesterday, saying: ‘We do not believe Lady Gaga’s performance was inappropriate for the family audience of The X Factor Results show, which has an established tradition of featuring performances from the biggest music stars of the moment. Lady Gaga is well known for her highly individual performance style.’
