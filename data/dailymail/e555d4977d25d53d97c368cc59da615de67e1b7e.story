Nile Ranger has offered his support to convicted rapist Ched Evans following the former Sheffield United striker's release from prison on Friday morning.

Evans served  half of his five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales  in 2011.

Whether the 25-year-old should be allowed to return to football has been heavily debated during recent weeks, and former Newcastle forward Ranger went on Twitter to offer his opinion.

He tweeted: 'Ched Evans top player... I hope he gets to play again!'

Ranger was himself cleared of rape earlier this year after a seven-day trial at Newcastle Crown Court.

The striker was alleged to have raped a woman in a hotel room in Newcastle but was cleared after the jury quickly reached a not-guilty verdict.

Ranger, who now plays for Blackpool in the Championship, was also convicted of two counts of assault by beating against two police officers in 2012.

Ranger's comments come as pressure continues to mount on Sheffield United to make a decision about whether to let Evans return to the club.

An online petition urging the Bramall Lane club not to welcome him back has received almost 150,000 signatures.

The Wales striker left Wymott Prison near Leyland, Lancashire at around 5am, where he was seen jumping into the back of a silver Mercedes ML 4x4.
