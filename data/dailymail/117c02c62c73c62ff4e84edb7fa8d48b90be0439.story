There wasn't much to smile about for England fans as their side fell to a one-day defeat by Australia.

But having seen their side lose narrowly by three wickets to their rivals Down Under, they also witnessed a local fan add a bit of comedy to proceedings - albeit unintentionally.

Trying to field a ball hit towards the boundary for four, one supporter lent just a little too far over the advertising hoardings, leading to him falling head over heels on to the turf.

It came much to the amusement of those nearby in the stadium and many more watching on TV.

Steve Smith masterminded a thrilling chase as Australia kept their foot on England's throat with a tense three-wicket victory in Hobart.

England's 303 for eight was their highest total in 20 one-day international innings, largely thanks to record-breaker Ian Bell's superb 141, but Smith's nerveless 102 not out in his first game as ODI captain helped Australia home with a ball to spare.
