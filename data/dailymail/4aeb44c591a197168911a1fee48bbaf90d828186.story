Victim: 17-year-old Dogan Ismail who was stabbed to death on Sunday

The family of a teenager stabbed to 
death protecting his younger brother during a row over a stolen phone is demanding justice.

Dogan Ismail, 17, died after being knifed in the chest on Sunday afternoon at a block of flats in Walworth, south-east London.

The sixth-form student and his younger 
brother Orhan, 15, had gone to retrieve a stolen BlackBerry
when they were confronted by up to four youths and a row broke out.

The brothers' cousin Sultan Orun, 25, said Orhan fought to save his brother's life but was unable to stem the blood.

Dogan collapsed in his brother's arms and Orhan was holding his chest to stop the blood.

'He said this picture of the stabbing will stay in his memory for the rest of his life,' she said.

According to his cousin Dogan was a 
committed student and  'family boy' who dreamed of running his own 
business who had never been in any trouble with the police.

'Why did they do this over a stupid 
phone? I hate them,' she told the Evening Standard.

'They took him away 
from me. There has got to be justice.'

The mobile phone had previously been stolen by a trio of pupils - that Orhan recognised from his school - as he walked home from playing football.

Two days later he received a message saying: 'If you come here we will give it back to you,' according to The Sun.

The pair headed to Latimer House to retrieve the phone, but instead one of the boys pulled out a knife and stabbed Dogan in the chest at the top of a stairwell.

The teenager bled to death as his younger brother tried desperately to save his life.

Orhan later told his family: 'He made to give back the phone, but instead brought a knife from behind his back and stabbed Dogan in the chest.

'His last words were, ‘Oh my God, you have stabbed me!’ The guy just calmly walked away.'

Police have now taken the unusual step of naming a youth wanted for questioning in connection with Dogan's death.

Dawda Jallow, 15, from the Peckham 
area, is described as black, clean shaven with cropped black afro hair, 
5ft 5in tall and slightly built.

He was spotted on a bus eight hours after the killing, detectives revealed today.

The CCTV footage is the only confirmed sighting of murder suspect whom police believe could have been wearing the same clothes when he was seen on a No. 35 bus from Camberwell Green in south London to Newington Causeway at 10.31pm on December 30th.

Appeal: This CCTV image released by London Metropolitan Police shows Dawda Jallow in a black jacket on a bus which he boarded at Camberwell Green at 10.19pm and got off at 10.32pm at Newington Causeway

He has brown eyes and speaks with a London accent, although he is a Gambian national.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner
of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, leading the investigation, 
said: 'I am seeking help from the local community to locate Dawda 
Jallow. I appeal to anyone who knows of his whereabouts, or has any 
information that could assist us, to come forward.

'If Dawda is seen, please do not approach him but contact police.

'I appeal direct to Dawda to present himself at a police station so this matter can be dealt with.'

Speaking at a press conference this afternoon DCI Bonner said: ‘Anybody who knows where he is or is thinking about offering him assistance whether that’s food, accommodation or money should think twice about it and give us a call instead.

‘I’ve thought long and hard about releasing his identity, but this is a serious incident and we need to speak to him and I believe this is a good way of prompting that.’

DCI Bonner said he did not believe the killing was gang related and added that police believe the suspect, who is from nearby Peckham, would stay in the local area.

Police carrying out investigations into the latest incident while flowers remain lying in tribute following the death of a 21-year-old man in September

Dogan, a business student at Walworth Academy, was of Turkish origin and lived in nearby Peckham.

The Metropolitan Police and London 
Ambulance Service were called to Latimer House, Beaconsfield Road, at 
4.20pm, where the victim, from Peckham, south-east London, was 
subsequently pronounced dead.

A 15-year-old boy has been arrested 
on suspicion of murder and a 39-year-old woman on suspicion of 
perverting the course of justice, and were yesterday bailed.

Mr Bonner added: 'My thoughts go out 
to Dogan's family, who have been left devastated by his senseless 
killing. That it should happen at this time of year is all the more 
tragic. I would like to urge anyone with information about this incident
to come forward and speak with my officers or, if they would prefer to 
remain anonymous, Crimestoppers.

Neighbours in the area have said they are living in fear following the second incident in a matter of months

The murder scene is yards from where 
21-year-old Shaun Chambers died on September 26 after being stabbed in 
an apparent gang-related killing.

Mr Chambers, 21, from Greenwich, was stabbed in the heart.

However Mr Bonner said there was 'no evidence' to suggest Dogan's death was gang related.

He said: 'I know there will also be 
local speculation about the fact that this murder took place on the same
spot that Shaun Chambers was killed on 26 September, but I would like 
to make clear that there is no link between the incidents aside from the
location.'

Dogan is the eighth teenager to be murdered in London in 2012.

Residents on the estate today said 
they were living in fear following the second such incident on their 
doorstep in the space of a few months.

Shaun Chambers, 21, died on September 26 after being stabbed in an apparent gang-related killing

A mother-of-two, who did not want to 
be identified, said: 'This is a very bad estate. It's so dangerous. I 
want to move, but I have to wait for the council to move me because I am
poor.'

Met Police are now cracking down on crime in the area and made 30 arrests as part of Operation Dragonet in December.

Southwark Chief Superintendent John 
Sutherland said: 'We have now put extra patrols on the street, but our 
overriding priority now is to get justice for Dogan and his family.'

Anyone with information should call police on 020 8358 0200 or, to remain anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

A 39-year-old woman and a 15-year-old boy have been arrested in connection with the latest incident
