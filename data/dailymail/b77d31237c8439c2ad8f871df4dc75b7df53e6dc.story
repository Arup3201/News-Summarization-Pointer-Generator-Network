Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has confirmed his interest in signing Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings, with the Gunners set to launch a January bid for £8million-rated star.

Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel takes a closer look at the 21-year-old who has been watched by every Premier League club this season.

He's a new name?

Yes, he's only hit the headlines over the past few months following a string of brilliant displays at left back for Ipswich towards the back end of last season and the start of this campaign.

Versatile Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings is wanted by Arsenal in the January transfer window

What are his attributes?

At 6ft 3ins he has the physical stature to deal with the rigours of Premier League football. He certainly has the pace too, his leggy stride eats up the ground effortlessly. As is a necessity for all modern-day full-backs, Mings is more than adept at joining in attack.

Why do Arsenal need another left back; they've already got Kieran Gibbs and Nacho Monreal?

Good point. Interestingly though, Arsenal don't see Mings as a long-term left back. They have designs on moulding him into a central defender. He has been known to fill in at right back, too. His versatility is a key selling point for Arsenal.

Mings has played most of his football at left back this season but Arsene Wenger wants him to play centrally

Makes a change for Arsenal not to be signing a youngster from Southampton?

True. But there is a twist; Mings actually started his academy career at St Mary's joining the Saints in 2001 as an eight-year-old. But he was forced to leave the south-coast club in 2009. He then spent spells at non-league outfits Yale Town and Chippenham Town before joining Ipswich for £10,000 in 2013.

How much will he cost?

Ipswich are demanding a hefty fee, between £8m-£10m, for Mings next month. Quite a mark up on the £10,000 they paid to bring him to Portman Road. Arsenal have been made aware of Ipswich's valuation.

Crystal Palace failed with a £3million bid for Mings during the summer transfer window

Was there interest in him during the summer transfer window?

Crystal Palace were very keen on the youngster in the summer and had a £3million bid turned down. The decision to reject the offer looks a very good decision now. Mings' valuation has sky-rocketed, with Ipswich likely to get at least double the £3m offered by Palace.

So is it just Arsenal who are interested?

No. He's been watched by every single Premier League club - but Arsenal seem the most serious in their interest. Palace remain interested, but know they are fighting a losing battle with the Gunners certain to move for Mings next month. Chelsea have also watched Mings of late. His dad, Adie, is actually a scout for the Blues.
