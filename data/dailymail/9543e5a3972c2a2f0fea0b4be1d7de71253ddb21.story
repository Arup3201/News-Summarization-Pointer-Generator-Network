A female suicide bomber killed a police officer and wounded another in an attack on a police station in the main tourist district of central Istanbul, the city governor has said.

The unidentified woman had walked into the police station and spoke English to officers, telling them she had lost her wallet, before setting off her suicide bomb. 

One policeman was badly wounded and later died in hospital, while another was lightly wounded in the attack in the Sultanahmet district on Tuesday afternoon, Istanbul's governor Vasip Sahin said.

'She approached the police at around 5pm, saying in English: 'I have lost my wallet'. That's all I can say. We are trying to identify the attacker,' said Sahin. 

'The female bomber lost her life. She has staged the attacked by detonating the bomb on her.'

Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet
Davutoglu said on Tuesday it was not immediately clear whether the
suicide bomber had links
to any particular group.  

'We have given instructions for the most
comprehensive investigations,' Davutoglu told reporters in a
brief statement in the capital Ankara. 

The Sultanahmet district, which is the home of world famous attractions including the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia museum, is visited by thousands of Turkish and foreign tourists every day.

Emergency services rushed to the scene and the city tram line that goes through the district was halted.

Officials said there was so far no indication of the nationality or identity of the female suicide bomber.

The attack came five days after a member of an outlawed Marxist group attacked police on guard outside the Ottoman-era Dolmabahce palace in Istanbul on the Bosphorus.

The man, named as Firat Ozcelik, hurled two grenades at the police honour guard on duty outside the palace but they failed to explode.

The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party–Front (DHKP-C) said it was behind the attack outside the Dolmabahce palace, which houses the Istanbul offices of the Turkish prime minister.
