Three mischievous pigs who fled their woodland pen to go on a month-long rampage had almost doubled in size by the time the farmer had found them.

The six-month-old sows broke free from their sty in the Forest of Bowland, Lancaster, where they were fed only grass as part of an environmental initiative.

Perhaps unsatisfied with their meager diet, the trio of Saddleback pigs escaped from the enclosure they shared with one other, sparking a lengthy man hunt which ended in their capture a month later.

Guilty: The three fugitive pigs were eventually found after having gone on the run for almost a month

When the six-month-old sows were eventually tracked down their keeper was shocked to discover they had ballooned in size

The pigs were eventually found grazing in a farmer's field by their keeper, Phil Dykes, reserve officer for the 
Lancashire Wildlife Trust.

'We’d had them for about three weeks 
and then three of them decided to do a runner under the fence.

'We could never understand why one stayed, but she got very sad lonely and had to go home to her owners.

'We had volunteers going to see them every day so it was my wife Rose who went one day and found three of them had gone.

'We started searching and going out with a bucket of food - their favourite - but there was no sign of them.'

The mischievous pigs left one other behind in the sty when they escaped in the Forest of Bowland, Lancaster

The animals were found grazing on a farmer's land, and put up a strong fight before being wrestled to the ground and taken back to their sty

Keeper, Phil Dykes, eventually found the animals after following trails of their excrement. He had become worried for the animals' welfare when they didn't return to the pen shortly after going missing

Mr Dykes, who began to worry for their welfare, eventually tracked them down by their excrement.

'I have become quite the expert in dung,' he said.

'I was worried about them because they had been gone so long and I was starting to think someone might have rounded them up. I was sure someone would have seen them in nearly a month, so I was very relieved to find them.'

It took three grown men to tackle the mischievous pigs to the ground before they were taken home.

'We had to have a pig wrestling match to get them on dog leads so we could take them home.

The pigs were taking part in a woodland environmental project to keep grass short and benefit the environment when they escaped

The Tamworth Two, Butch and Sundance, famously escaped the butcher's knife before being settled into a sanctuary by the Daily Mail in 1998

'They thought it was highly amusing, but they were worn out when we finally got them home' 

'They have been happy as Larry since they got back. They are very inquisitive animals and they were definitely pleased to see us.'

Their great escape bears resemblance to that of the Tamworth Two, a pair of pigs who managed to flee a transit lorry while being taken to an abattoir in 1998.

Named after film outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the siblings were six months old when they made headlines across the world.

After being recaptured, the animals were treated to a luxury life in the Rare Breeds Centre in Woodchurch near Ashford, Kent, by the Daily Mail.
