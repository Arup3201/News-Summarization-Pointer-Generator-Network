Manuel Neuer was clearly enjoying the trappings of his World Cup success after being pictured enjoying the last of his holiday in the company of a bevy of beautiful ladies.

The goalkeeper was instrumental in Germany's first World Cup victory in 24 years, winning the Golden Glove award for the best keeper at the tournament after the Germans added a fourth star to their shirts by beating Lionel Messi's Argentina 1-0 in the final.

Despite visiting the Greek island of Mykonos with girlfriend Kathrin Gilch, the 28-year-old found time to pose for a group photo with some female admirers that was posted on his Instagram account with a caption reading: 'enjoying my vacation before it all starts again with @fcbayern!'.

Neuer will be joined by fellow World Cup winners including Bastian Schweinsteiger, Philipp Lahm and Mario Gotze in the States - while star midfielders Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and new signing Robert Lewandowski are also expected to feature.
