He's laughing: Jeremy Clarkson, who has been paid millions by the BBC for his stake in the company behind Top Gear's global success

Jeremy Clarkson made more than £14million from Top Gear last year after a BBC move to take full control of the hit series' production company boosted his presenters salary, it was claimed today.

BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm, bought out the controlling stake in Bedder 6, a firm formed in partnership with Clarkson to exploit the show's global commercial potential.

The purchase was a 'deal to secure the talent integral to the brand's future,' according to BBC Worldwide's Annual Review, which was published today.

It comes after Top Gear has enjoyed 
massive global success, with profits from the worldwide distribution 
increasing five-fold in the five years since the Bedder 6 venture was 
set up.

Clarkson received £8.4million for his 
30 per cent stake in Bedder 6, the Guardian reported, after BBC 
Worldwide in September last year exercised an option to take full 
control of the company.

Prior to the sale, he also received an
additional £4.86million dividend payment from the firm related to the 
profits from the worldwide success of Top Gear.

Added to his presenting fee, thought 
to be just under £1million, that takes his total earnings from the brand
to more than £14million.

Only Clarkson's presenter's salary is paid from the licence fee.

BBC Worldwide formed Bedder 6 partnership with Clarkson and Top Gear producer Andy Wilman in 2008 to channel revenues from the global exploitation of the show through the company.

Wilman received £5.6million for his 20 per cent stake in the venture, the Guardian reported.

A BBC spokesman insisted that no licence fee money was used to buy up Clarkson and Wilman's stakes in Bedder 6.

'No licence fee income was used by BBC Worldwide to pay the exiting shareholders of Bedder 6 in 2012,' he said.

'In
just five years the business grew its profits five-fold (and its 
revenue to £149million), which would not have been possible without the 
involvement of the show's creative talent.

'The
deal also secured the future of the Top Gear brand for the BBC and BBC 
Worldwide and we now benefit from 100 per cent of its profit stream.'

BBC Worldwide's Annual Review said: 'In September 2012 BBC Worldwide acquired its non-controlling interest in Bedder 6, the entity through which Top Gear operated internationally, as part of a deal to secure the talent integral to the brand’s future.

'As a result of this transaction there was a £14.4million cash outflow and a £1.8million charge within other gains and losses.

'Prior to acquisition, a dividend from pre-deal retained earnings was also paid by Bedder 6 Ltd to its shareholders, resulting in a net cash outflow of £8.1m for the Group.'

BBC Worldwide made a total profit of just over £156million in the 12 months to March, on sales of nearly £1.2billion. It handed back nearly all the profit to the public, licence-fee funded arm.

It has made more than £1billion for the corporation since its creation in 2007.
