These are the injuries suffered by a political activist beaten viciously by Hong Kong police who moved into clear pro-democracy demonstrations last night.

Police handcuffed Ken Tsang Kin-chiu, a member of the pro-democracy Civic Party, before dragging him into a dark corner next to a protest site where they punched and kicked him for several minutes.

Hong Kong authorities said the officers had been 'removed' from their posts while an investigation was carried out after the whole incident was filmed and broadcast by local network TVB.

It came amid some of the worst violence since the start of the pro-democracy rallies in Hong Kong two weeks ago, as police attacked demonstrators who had tried to occupy a tunnel.

Demonstrators and police fought running battles overnight, with officers using their fists, batons and pepper spray to beat back crowds gathered near the city government headquarters.

Police dragged away dozens of activists, tore down barricades and removed concrete slabs the protesters used as road blocks around the underpass in an operation they said was needed to restore public order.

Police said they arrested 45 protesters in the early hours, using pepper spray on those who resisted. Four officers were injured, police said.

The attack was launched hours after a large group of protesters blockaded the underpass, expanding their protest zone after police earlier cleared them away from other streets.

Police said they had to disperse the protesters because they were disrupting public order and gathering illegally.

'I have to stress here that even though protesters raised their hands in their air it does not mean it was a peaceful protest,' said police spokesman Tsui Wai-Hung.

He claimed some protesters kicked the officers and attacked them with umbrellas. None of those arrested were hurt, he said, despite the television footage showing six plainclothes police beating a handcuffed protester.

Mr Tsui did not provide details of the incident when questioned by reporters. Alan Leong, leader of Hong Kong's pro-democracy Civic Party, identified the person in the video as Ken Tsang Kin-chiu.

Civic Party legislator Dennis Kwok, a lawyer representing Mr Tsang, said police also beat Mr Tsang inside a police station. Mr Tsang had since been taken to hospital, Mr Kwok said.

Mr Tsang is a social worker. The Hong Kong Social Workers' Association said it planned to march to police HQ in the evening to protest.

Photographs showing Tsang with bruising on his face and body, released by democracy activists, sparked anger and condemnation. Human rights group Amnesty International said the police involved in what appeared to be a 'vicious attack against a detained man' should face justice

Prominent student leader Joshua Wong said trust between police and activists has now ebbed to an all-time low.

'The proper action police should take is to bring the protester to the police car, not to take him away and then punch and kick him for four minutes,' he told reporters.

Police had previously been criticised for firing tear gas on umbrella-wielding protesters as demonstrations began on September 28 in a move that riveted the world's attention.

Demonstrators have also accused them of failing to come to their aid during frequent attacks from violent pro-government thugs, who are rumoured to be paid-off members of triad gangs.

Hong Kong's security chief sought to douse tensions over the video, expressing 'concern' and promising a 'just and fair investigation'.

'The policemen who are involved in the incident have been removed from their current working positions,' Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok said without specifying how many officers were being probed.

Police, again without referring to Tsang, said in a statement they had used minimum force, including pepper spray, to disperse the protesters who had gathered illegally overnight.

The operation was the toughest against largely student protesters and came after demonstrators swarmed into a tunnel on a four-lane thoroughfare, halting traffic and chanting for universal suffrage.

In intense scenes overnight, a wall of police armed with shields and batons marched before dawn on crowds who had erected new barricades in a road tunnel next to the headquarters of the city's embattled government.

Clutching the umbrellas that have become emblematic of their fight for full democracy, some protesters were pulled to the ground, handcuffed and hauled away by officers.

The violence was among the worst seen since the start of rallies that have drawn huge crowds calling for Beijing to grant the semi-autonomous city the right to hold free elections.

A police statement said officers had warned that 'advancing against police cordon line even with their arms raised is not a peaceful act', and had appealed to the demonstrators to 'stay calm and restrained'.

'There were so many police. They punched people ... We are peaceful,' Danny Chiu, a student in his 20s, told Reuters, breaking down in tears.

Ben Ng, an 18-year-old student, was with protesters near a newly built barricade when the baton-wielding contingent approached.

'Police used pepper spray without any threat or warning. Protesters were beaten by police,' he said. 'Both protesters and police, their emotions are very unstable.'

Protesters have been demanding full democracy for the city. They are also calling for its pro-Beijing leader, Leung Chun-ying, to step down.

When negotiating the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from Britain, China's ruling Communist leaders agreed to a 'one country, two systems' that would preserve Western-style civil liberties and broad autonomy in the territory, while promising eventual democracy. Protesters see Beijing as reneging on that promise.

The demonstrations have posed an unprecedented challenge to the government. Organizers say as many as 200,000 people thronged the streets for peaceful sit-ins after police used tear gas to disperse the unarmed protesters.

The numbers have since dwindled and their campaign, now into its third week, has caused traffic chaos and drained public support for their actions.

Beijing issued its harshest condemnations yet of the protests, calling them illegal, bad for business and against Hong Kong's best interests. The central government has become increasingly impatient with the demonstrations, the biggest challenge to Beijing's authority since China took control of the former British colony in 1997.

A front-page editorial Wednesday in the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's mouthpiece, condemned the protests and said 'they are doomed to fail.'

'Facts and history tell us that radical and illegal acts that got their way only result in more severe illegal activities, exacerbating disorder and turmoil,' the commentary said.

'Stability is bliss, and turmoil brings havoc,' it said.

However, there were no signs that the central government was planning to become directly involved in suppressing the demonstrations, which are pushing for greater say in choosing the territory's next leader in 2017 elections.

Beijing is eager to end the protests to avoid emboldening activists and others on the mainland seen as a threat to the Communist Party's monopoly on power.

In language freighted with political symbolism, Zhang Xiaoming, director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong, was quoted as telling Hong Kong legislators at a banquet Tuesday that the protest movement 'is a serious social and political incident.'

Zhang said the movement challenged Beijing's authority and had caused the city to suffer huge economic losses. They had 'hurt the basis of Hong Kong's rule of law, democratic development, social harmony, international image and its relations with the mainland,' he said.

Zhang called for an end to the protests as soon as possible to avoid further losses to Hong Kong's citizenry as a whole.
