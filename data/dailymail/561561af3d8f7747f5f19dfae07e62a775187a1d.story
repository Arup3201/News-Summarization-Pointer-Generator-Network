A benefits cheat who has claimed more than £20,000 in disability allowance despite moving to the sun-soaked Costa del Sol ten years ago has escaped jail.

Susan Barringer, originally of Waterthorpe, Sheffield, failed to tell the authorities she had moved abroad in 2004 and instead continued to claim benefits while living in a mobile home in Spain.

The 56-year-old, who appeared at Sheffield Crown Court in a mobility scooter, admitted failing to notify the authorities of a change in her circumstances but was spared jail by the judge who said she had 'told deliberate lies'.

Patrick Palmer, prosecuting, told the court that Barringer began claiming disability living allowance in 2001 because she was 'almost unable to walk'.

However, he said an investigation was launched after her bank accounts showed she had been spending money abroad.

She was also found to be using a mobile phone in Malaga, southern Spain.

Mr Palmer said that when Barringer began to claim benefits she had to sign a form which stated she would inform the authorities if she was abroad for more than four weeks.

However, Barringer claimed she was unaware she had to inform the authorities that she was not in the country.

Mr Palmer said she was living in a mobile home on the Costa del Sol which she bought in 2004 for between £10,000 and £15,000 after inheriting approximately £30,000 from her ex-husband.

The court heard that after she move abroad, Barringer claimed a total of £20,097 to which she was not entitled.

David Webster, defending, said she was a hard-working woman who was caring for her elderly mother. 

However, he added: 'The excursions to Spain are over.'

Judge Recorder Ray Singh handed Barringer a 12-week jail term, suspended for 18 months, and made her the subject of a curfew from 9pm to 6am every night

He told her: 'You were not, in essence, living in this jurisdiction since 2004.You were no doubt fully aware you must notify a change in circumstances whether or not you were resident in the UK.

'You clearly chose to ignore that by not reporting these changes. When interviewed you told deliberate lies to the officer investigating.'
