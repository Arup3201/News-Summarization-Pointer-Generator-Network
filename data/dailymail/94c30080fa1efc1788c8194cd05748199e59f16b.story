She famously shed her baby weight within weeks of having her second child and with a fitness DVD, an OK! health column and a London Triathlon under her belt since the birth of her son AJ in February, Michelle shows no signs of slowing down.

So how does she do it? 'I don't know!,' she told MailOnline. 'A very understanding husband maybe and a lot of will power to get up early to work out. I do a lot of my projects at night when the kids are asleep. It's a balancing act. I don't have nannies or family nearby but we make it work.'

The fitness-crazed mother-of-two, who recently shared an envy-inducing picture of her toned stomach on holiday, said exercise is extremely important to her.

Fitness fanatic: Michelle Heaton has a serious passion for fitness and told FEMAIL that she loves to get a work-out in early in the morning before her children have even woken up

'It gives me energy and makes me feel good on the inside and out and a happy mum is a happy home,' she said.

Michelle, 35, revealed that she works out between four and five times a week and it's always on an empty stomach before her two children, Faith, two, six-month-old son AJ, even wake up. 

'I mix up my work outs up so my body is always guessing and never gets used to what I'm doing,' she said of her fitness regime.

What's her secret? Michelle, who proudly posted the picture above on Twitter, tries to have a balanced diet and mixes up her work-out regime to keep her body guessing

When it comes to food, she says that she's tried every type of diet in the past but nothing works for her other than when she's eating really healthily at home.

'I very rarely slip up with my food in the house but I reward my hard work with date nights and eating out at weekends,' she said.

'It's all a balancing act with maintenance, if you’re good 70 per cent of the time you should enjoy the other 30 per cent.

'However, if weight loss is your goal then there's no 30 per cent margin - it's called a diet for a reason so you need to put in the hard work and have patience to lose weight effectively. It doesn’t happen overnight.'

Future popstar? Michelle shot to fame in pop group Liberty-X so will  Faith be a star one day too? Michelle says she will guide her daughter as best she can in whatever she chooses to do

Little one: Michelle, pictured with baby boy AJ, says that every day is a challenge and she learns something new about her children all the time

So would she want little Faith to follow in her pop star footsteps? 'She's definitely a star in my eyes, whether it translates in later life who knows. I will let her decide and guide her as best as I can along the way,' said Michelle. 

Michelle, who won Disney's Mum of the Year Award back in March, said to win an award which was voted for by the public was an 'unbelievable feeling'.

The former Liberty-X star shared what she thinks makes a great mother, saying: 'I personally think what makes a good mum is patience, nurturing and listening to your child's wants and needs instead of imposing your own ways that you may have read about in a book - every child and family is different. 

'Every day is a challenge; you learn something new about your children or parenting or even yourself. It's challenging but rewarding all at the same time as you see these beautiful people growing up before your eyes. I love learning about my children, it's fascinating.' 

Girl's night out: Michelle Heaton recently took a few hours off mother duty and enjoyed a night out in the city at wine experience Vinopolis, as part of the Summer Of Love events calendar, and newly opened restaurant Forge with gal pals including fellow singer Liz McClarnon, Gemma Bissix of Hollyoaks fame, Nicola Stapleton most recently on EastEnders and Melanie Cameron

Michelle was diagnosed as a carrier of the deadly cancer gene BRCA2 gene in 2012 and subsequently announced that she would have a full hysterectomy to avoid the risk of ovarian cancer, which she said she would be doing for the sake of her family.

Aside from that, she is about to start filming a documentary and she has some projects coming up with the Lorraine show.

She added: 'I’m also going on a trek next year in Morocco for the Genesis Trust – it’s in support of women in a similar position to me who’ve been though similar experiences. Come and join me; there are still places left!'.
