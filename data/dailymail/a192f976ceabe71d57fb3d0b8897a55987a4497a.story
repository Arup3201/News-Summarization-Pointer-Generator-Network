President Barack Obama has ruled out an immediate campaign of air strikes against a militant Islamist terror group that is running roughshod over Iraq, senior administration officials told reporters on Wednesday.

When he meets at 3:00 p.m. with congressional leaders from both parties, he will reportedly explain his preference for continued diplomacy and intelligence gathering for Iraq's army over bombing and guided-missile campaigns.

Although the president hasn't made a final decision – that will likely come by week's end – plugged-in officials are talking quietly about a 'comprehensive' approach that would include deploying limited numbers of Special Forces and applying pressure to Iraq's Shia government to be more inclusive of the country's Sunni minority.

A 5:10 p.m. meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry will follow the president' sit-down with key members of Congress, according to his schedule.

They need help: Iraqi Shiite tribal fighters are pushing back against ISIS, but Iraq's leaders are still asking the Obama White House for air strikes to slow them down

Getting closer: As ISIS moves toward Baghdad, its militants are detonating car bombs in the city, like this lethal blast on Wednesday in Baghdad's Shia-dominated Sadr City region

A Sunni al-Qaeda offshoot called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has swept its insurgency across eastern Syria and northern and central Iraq, capturing cities and executing hundreds if not thousands of Iraqi army soldiers.

Obama's military commanders, according to multiple news accounts, have been unable to pinpoint the locations of key ISIS targets, making precision bombing unlikely to succeed.

And carpet bombing of the 'shock and awe' brand that Americans saw in the 1989, they say, would inflict mass civilian casualties while doing little to slow down ISIS as it tries to capture Baghdad and depose the government. 

Instead, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, Obama is leaning toward a strategy that puts U.S. Special Forces on the ground to help the Iraqi army gather intelligence while diplomats pressure Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to be more inclusive of his countrymen on the opposite side of Iraq's political divide.

According to Fox News, a deployment of 100 special operators from among the U.S. armed forces is being considered.

In advance of Wednesday's White House confab, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he wouldn't support any deployment of military personnel to Iraq to intervene in what amounts to a civil war.

'It's time for the Iraqis to resolve it themselves,' said Reid, adding that 'those who attack President Obama for bringing our troops home from Iraq are wrong and out of step with the American people.'

Obama has said he will not put 'boots on the ground' in Iraq but told Congress on Monday that as many as 275 U.S. forces, 'armed for combat,' are being sent to Baghdad to protect American interests as embassy staff and assets are moved to safer places.

While Iraq descended further into chaos, Obama returned to the White House Tuesday night following a fundraising trip to New York City that also included a speech at a gay rights gala

According to the Associated Press, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said Wednesday that the Iraqi government has asked the U.S. for air strikes against ISIS's militants.

But with Iraq in bloody chaos, it may be impossible for U.S. intelligence agencies to confirm the locations of the group's top leaders including Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

ISIS is the same group that came to power with the name Al-Qaeda In Iraq.

An ABC News report cites an unnamed Obama administration official saying that if the president chooses to launch air strikes, the result would be a limited campaign of surgical drone strikes similar to U.S. intervention in Yemen and Pakistan.

That possibility has The New York Times speculating about the political fallout if Obama announces any kind of offensive.

'The limited scale of any military action may make it easier for Mr. Obama to sell to Congress and the public,' the Times reports.
