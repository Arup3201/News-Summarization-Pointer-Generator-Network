England took on Germany in a penalty shootout and won, but not without the helping hand of a big Finn.

For Jussi Jaaskelainen was West Ham's hero as they overcame hosts Schalke 7-6 following a dire goalless draw in Gelsenkirchen.

The stopper saved from Felipe Santana and then, decisively, from Axel Borgmann as a tedious contest reached a thrilling climax hardly in keeping with the previous 90 minutes. 

At long last: West Ham celebrate beating Schalke on penalties after a 0-0 draw

Big Finn: Jussi Jaaskelainen was the hero for the Hammers, saving the final spot-kick

WEST HAM: Jaaskelainen; O'Brien, Tomkins (Reid 46), Collins, Potts; Downing (Vaz Te 78), Kouyate (Diame 54), Poyet, Fanimo (Lletget 54); Nolan; C.Cole (Lee 83)

SCHALKE: Giefer, Freidrich, Kolasinac (Avdijaj 62), Boateng, Hoger, Choupo-Moting (Aogo 62), Fuchs, Barnetta (Meyer 46), Multhaup, Matip (Santana 46), Neustadter

PENALTIES: 0:1 Nolan, Neustadt 1:1, 1:2 Collins, 2:2 Meyer, Vaz Te Fires, 3:2 Papadopoulos, 3: 3 Lee, Jaaskelainen parried against Santana, Poyet 3:4, 4:4 Aogo, 4:5 O’Brien, 5:5 Itter, 5:6 Potts, Sobottka 6:6, 6:7 Lletget. 

In an arduous first half, Schalke's Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting escaped down the right before centring and Jaaskelainen had to be on his guard to save at the near post.

Christian Fuchs took aim from range for the hosts and was unlucky to see his effort whistle narrowly over the crossbar.

Cameroon international Choupo-Moting looked Schalke's best bet for a goal and he cracked the base of the post having seized on a mistake by James Collins.

The same player the drilled wide from distance before teeing up Kevin-Prince Boateng whose effort was saved by Jasskelainen.

The former Finland international was again called into action before the break as he got down low to repel defender Marvin Friedrich's measured steer after Schalke had worked a short corner into the area. 

Strong: James Collins of West Ham does well to tackle Schalke star Kevin Prince Boateng on Saturday

Pinned to his chair: Hammers boss Sam Allardyce watches on from the sidelines in Gelsenkirchen

On the run: Joey O'Brien looks to make things happen for West ham

It was from a corner after half-time that the Hammers got their first real sight at goal, Stewart Downing's floater landed on the forehead of Collins but he flashed wide when unmarked just six yards out.

Friedrich then struck the post following a goalmouth scramble midway through the second period but chances were at a premium as the half wore on. 

And so it was that Jaaskelainen emerged the hero as Sam Allardyce celebrated his first victory of a difficult pre-season which has seen Andy Carroll ruled out for four months because of an ankle injury and co-owner David Gold 'favourite' a Twitter post criticising the boss. 

Midfielder Ravel Morrison was then remanded in custody after being charged with two counts of common assault.

But West Ham will emerge as Schalke 04 Cup victors should they beat Malaga on Sunday afternoon.
