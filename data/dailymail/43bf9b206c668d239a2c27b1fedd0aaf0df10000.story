Chelsea have revealed their new third kit for the 2014/15 Premier League season.

It's the first time since Chelsea's 2009/10 double winning season that the west London club have chosen to wear navy blue colours.

The shirt features soundwave-style light blues line, which according to adidas, 'Symbolizes the volume of support from the fans at every away game.'

Jose Mourinho will certainly be hoping the new kit brings around another double winning season as he searches for his first piece of silverware since returning to Stamford Bridge.

With the acquisitions of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis, the Chelsea boss seems confident his side can fight on all fronts.  

Speaking during Chelsea's pre-season tour in Austria, Mourinho said: 'This season we think we are going to be stronger, the younger players are more experienced, they are stable and better adapted to fighting for titles.’

‘If I didn’t think that way I would go home and let somebody else take charge of the team,’ said the Blues boss.
