Nemanja Vidic has thanked the Manchester United fans for their support as the defender prepares to leave the club after more than eight years at Old Trafford.

The 32-year-old Serbia centre half will join Inter Milan this summer having made almost 300 appearances for United since joining in 2005.

Vidic will say his farewell to the fans when Ryan Giggs's side take on Hull on Tuesday night.

Writing in the matchday programme, he said: ‘Thank you for all the support you have given me over the years. I know I will be supporting the club in the future.

‘You never know what's going to happen with emotions. You can try to predict but I wasn't emotional before and I haven't cried yet.'

Vidic admits the lap of the pitch won't be the same without a trophy but that it is 'the least the players can do' to thank the supporters.

He said: 'As we didn't do well this season, that walk around Old Trafford won't be the same after many years where we have always been celebrating something after the final game. Now, it has become a chance to thank the fans for supporting us this year. I think this is definitely the least that we can do.

'We must perform in these last games to give them something to look forward to next season and to believe this team can win again. That is what the players are thinking about now - to try to put on good performances and build on that next season.'

Back in the day: Vidic joined United from Spartak Moscow in 2005 and has made almost 300 apperances

Vidic has been a fans' favourite at the club since he moved to England from Spartak Moscow for £7million on Christmas Day 2005.

He will take five Premier League winner's medals with him to Italy, as well as the one he gained for helping United lift the Champions League in 2008.

Although Vidic has not been the same player since rupturing cruciate ligaments during United's Champions League defeat by Basle in December 2011, he is still highly-regarded by fans, players and the coaching staff at Old Trafford.

'When you see a player like Nemanja Vidic is leaving this club you feel really sad,' United left back Patrice Evra said.

'I call him the rock. I am lucky to have played alongside him, for me he was a great centre back.'
