Forget a packet of paracetamol for stomach ache or Vaseline for your chapped lips - people who fell ill  four hundred years ago had to make do with crab's eyes and hog's lard for treating ailments.

That's according to a collection of household cures from the 17th century - most of which are bizarre to modern eyes - that has gone on display.

Long before the arrival of our NHS, people had to rely on their own medicines if they fell ill - and that included treating kidney stones with a dove’s foot boiled in white wine.

virgin’s wax' and 'two ounces of hog’s lard' - the fat on a hog's back. It is unclear what virgin's wax is.

In
 his 1652 work ‘The English Physician’ author Nicholas Culpeper advised

She said: 'I really wanted the exhibition to shed some light on an area that, traditionally, has been a little neglected.
