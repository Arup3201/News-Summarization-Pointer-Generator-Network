Hundreds of thousands of patients are still too afraid to speak out about poor NHS care, experts warned yesterday.

They estimate that a quarter of a million incidents a year are never reported because patients and relatives think it will only make matters worse.

Many are scared that it will have repercussions for their subsequent treatment while others fear the whole ordeal will just cause more ‘pain and grief'.

Today a report commissioned by the Government is expected to warn that NHS staff who dare criticise standards of care are routinely being suspended or bullied out of their jobs.

It has been chaired by Robert Francis, the barrister who oversaw an inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, who has sought evidence from hundreds of doctors, nurses and other employees.

But Dr Katherine Rake, chief executive of Healthwatch England, warned that the majority of patients who experience complain because they have no faith anything will be done.

She also warned that more than half of patients who do raise grievances never get an apology from the staff responsible for the mistake.

Giving evidence to MPs, Dr Rake, whose organisation champions’ patients’ rights, said: ‘Our research shows that only 40 per cent of people who have concern or complaint actually raise that concern or complaint to a member of the health service.

‘We estimate we lose quarter of a million complaints every year which is equates to a complaint one every two minutes because trust and confidence is so low.

‘People fear for repercussions on their care, particularly where it is very personal such as in GP services or a care setting.’

Dr Rake, an academic in social policy who formerly advised the Government, also said that bereaved relatives were being made to wait three years for apologies over the deaths of their loved ones.

She said that only this week she had been speaking to a woman whose mother had died from a broken hip sustained during a a fall at a care home.

Dr Rake said the woman described the ordeal of trying to find out exactly what had happened ‘like a three year slog’

She added that staff were so defensive the woman felt like she was saying something ‘dirty or wrong.’

The figures are based on research by Healthwatch over the last two years including two polls covering 3,00 members of the public and detailed surveys of 400 patients.

They consistently showed that around 60 per cent of patients who suffered poor care did not complain. Around 170,000 patients do bother to complain about the NHS every year so based on the assumption that two thirds do not report poor care, around 250 incidences are unreported.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt promised to transform the NHS’s handling of complaints in October 2013 following a damning review by MP Ann Clwyd, whose husband had died following poor care.

But this evidence suggests very little has changed over the last year.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said making a complaint very often added to victims’ pain and grief.

Also giving evidence to MPs on the Public Administration Committee, she added: ‘Patients and relatives tell us that complaints system bureaucratic complex confusing and v often adds to pain and grief already suffering

‘Patients tell us its very time consuming and difficult to speak to person they need.

‘When people complain it takes very, very long time to get an outcome

‘We certainly hear from patients who contact our national helpline about their fear of complaining in case their ongoing care will be compromised.

‘These are very often people who have been bereaved, who have been traumatised, and that whole episode has just compounded the grief for them.’
