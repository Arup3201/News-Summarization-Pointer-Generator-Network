Proud father Wayne Rooney has shared a picture of his newborn son Klay Anthony after wife Coleen gave birth in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

The 27-year-old footballer is seen cradling baby Klay Anthony Rooney while three-year-old Kai sits on his lap and radiant but tired Coleen, wearing a floral robe, envelops her family.

Alongside the image, Wayne wrote: 'My family with our new baby boy Klay.'

The picture came after Wayne announced the birth to his six million followers on Tuesday morning, writing: 'Our Beautiful 
Son Klay Anthony Rooney was born at 2.11am, Weighing 7Ib 11.5 oz. Both
Klay and Coleen are fine..... We're all delighted!!'

Coleen, also 27, echoed her husband's sentiments by adding: 'At 2.11am our Beautiful Son .... Klay Anthony 
Rooney entered the world. He weighed 7Ib 11.1/2 oz We're all so happy 
and doing well. X.'

Following Klay's arrival, an excited Kai was seen arriving at Liverpool Women's Hospital on Tuesday morning to meet his new baby brother.

The three-year-old was carrying an 'it's a baby boy' balloon as he walked in with his grandparents Colette and Tony McLoughlin.

Celebrities including Coleen's fellow
WAGs Danielle O'Hara, Alex Gerrard and Sheree Murphy, as well as other 
stars including Ed Sheeran and 
Apprentice mogul Lord Sugar were quick to send congratulations.

Among
the family tweets, Coleen's brother Anthony McLoughlin tweeted: 'Made 
up for @ColeenRoo and @WayneRooney ..well done , another nephew to put 
on the naughty step!!'

Claire Rooney, who is Wayne's cousin and Coleen's best friend, tweeted: 'Congratulations @ColeenRoo & @WayneRooney on the new addition to the family gorgeous baby Klay!! Can't wait to meet him! Well done!'

And cousin Leanne Rooney tweeted: 'Congratulations @ColeenRoo @WayneRooney on your beautiful baby boy Klay!! Can't wait to meet him x.'

Fashion
designer Coleen, who revealed over the weekend she had passed her due 
date, was said to have been taken to hospital on Saturday, after 
admitting she had struggled to sleep the night before.

And then there were four: Kai has been preparing to become a big brother for months

She tweeted: 'Such an uncomfortable sleep last night!!! #hurryupbaby (sic).'

And Coleen admitted during an 
interview in the Daily Mirror earlier this month that she was looking 
forward to having some sleep after giving birth... perhaps forgetting 
the sleepless nights having a newborn can entail.

She said: 'It’s been really good, but I am looking 
forward to having a good night’s sleep. I have to keep getting up in the
night because I can’t get comfortable.'

Making it a double: Wayne announced the good news on his Twitter page in the early hours of Tuesday morning

Happy days: After going into labour late on Saturday night, Coleen was delighted to announce the arrival of her second son

Family excitement: The McLoughlins and Rooney were thrilled by the new arrival

Something to occupy Kai: Coleen's father Anthony was carrying a bag of Kai's toys

The couple announced in December they were expecting a son, two months after confirming Coleen's second pregnancy.

Announcing the baby's sex via Twitter, Coleen wrote: 'Absolutely loved seeing our baby on the scan yesterday!!!

'We decided to find out the sex...... It's a ..... BOY!! So exciting @WayneRooney.'

Coleen has previously admitted she 
would love to have a large family, saying: 'I'd like to have maybe three
or four children. I'd be happy to be a full-time mum.'

Spending time together: The trio were seen at Manchester United's final game of the season against West Bromwich Albion on 19th May

And Coleen added that Kai was more than a little excited about becoming a big brother.

She said: 'He’s
given up on having a brother now and doesn’t believe he’s actually ever
going to arrive. He’s so ready for him to be here now!'

Following in the footsteps of the 
Kardashians, the Rooneys could end up naming their future children with 
names beginning with K, after choosing the monikers Kai and Klay for 
their boys.

Date night: Wayne took Coleen to the Neighbourhood Restaurant in Manchester that night after the team celebrated winning the Premier League

'Hurry up baby!' Coleen admitted she was feeling uncomfortable as she neared the end of her pregnancy

Growing brood: Coleen tweeted an adorable picture of Kai and Wayne earlier this month

Klay - often spelled Clay - is an old English name which means 'mortal'.

Manchester United ace Wayne and Coleen married in Italy in 2008 after a five-year engagement.

The unsettled striker is now expected
to have some downtime with his family before linking up with Roy Hodgson's England squad at the weekend 
ahead of next Wednesday's friendly at Wembley against the Republic of 
Ireland.

Despite 
ongoing issues at United, with his future at Old Trafford still 
uncertain having asked for a transfer, Rooney is in contention to 
captain his country.

You did so well! Coleen's fellow WAGs Danielle O'Hara, Alex Gerrard and Sheree Murphy were quick to send their congratulations

Congratulations! Lord Sugar and Ed Sheeran joined lots of other fans in tweeting well wishes to Wayne
