A convicted fraudster who is believed to have stolen more than £60million in a number of frauds is finally facing justice after four years on the run.

Michael Brown - the Liberal Democrat's largest donor - is expected to be in a British jail within ten days.

He was deported to Spain from the Dominican Republic, where he had been living a lavish lifestyle with stolen millions.

But last night Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg continued to insist the Lib Dems will not repay £2.4million of ill-gotten gains Brown gave his party in 2005.

And mystery continues to surround a missing £18million which police are still trying to trace.

That decision sparked fury yesterday amid claims that even Brown thinks the Lib Dems failed to scrutinise his firm properly before accepting the cash.

Brown will face an extradition hearing this week that should lead to him being put on a plane to the UK to serve a seven-year prison sentence.

An international manhunt was launched when he went on the run after stealing up to £60million, including £8million from Martin Edwards, the former chairman of Manchester United.

Police are still trying to trace around £18million of that haul.

Brown fled the UK for the Caribbean after being convicted of fraud at Southwark Crown Court in 2008.

He was arrested in the Dominican Republic in January in the town of Punta Cana over an unrelated fraud charge.

Prosecutors in the Dominican Republic said Brown was deported to Spain at the request of British police.

The UK does not have a formal extradition agreement with the Dominican Republic, so in an elaborate deal it was agreed that he would be sent first to Spain.

If Brown does not appeal against extradition to Britain, it will have to take place within ten days.

beaches

A spokesman for the City of London Police said: ‘We will be taking the appropriate steps to bring him back via a European Arrest Warrant.’

Det Supt Bob Wishart added: ‘Mr Brown is a step closer to returning to the UK to start his prison sentence.

‘We hope that him facing justice will bring some closure to the victims who suffered as a result of his frauds.’

But his victims got cold comfort from the Liberal Democrats, who have repeatedly refused to hand over money to those defrauded by Brown.

An Electoral Commission inquiry in 2009 found the Lib Dems accepted the fraudster’s donation in good faith and cleared them of wrongdoing.

Mr Clegg denied the party had a moral responsibility to hand over the money.

He said: ‘I’m very pleased he’s coming back to serve his sentence. This is a convicted fraudster.

‘I should stress that this is something which happened, as far as the Liberal Democrats are concerned, before I was even an MP, let alone leader of the Liberal Democrats.

‘And what I’ve been told is that the Electoral Commission in 2009 looked at this exhaustively, as far as the receipt of that money by the Liberal Democrats from one of his companies, and they categorically concluded that the money was received in good faith and all the controls, all the checks that should have been made, were reasonably made by the Liberal Democrats at the time.

‘If we’d been shown wanting on those accounts, then of course we should pay the money back.’

Michael Brown made a record donation to the Liberal Democrat party which is now run by Nick Clegg

Labour deputy chairman Tom Watson 
yesterday published details of a draft letter written by Mr Brown, which
he says is with the police, and in which the fraudster alleges the Lib 
Dems carried out only rudimentary checks on whether his was a legitimate
company.

It says: ‘In the case of the donation made by my company, very little due diligence was undertaken.

‘A
check was made in Companies House that the company was duly 
incorporated but little or no due diligence was undertaken on whether 
the company was trading.’

Mr
Watson said: ‘It’s hard not to conclude that the money should be 
repaid. Clearly, Mr Clegg’s party failed to conduct all proper checks.’

Labour MP Steve McCabe called for ‘proceeds of crime legislation to be used to recover money he gave Lib Dems’.

Mike Gapes, another MP, added the ‘Lib Dems surely have a moral responsibility to pay back to his victims’.

The
usual route from the Dominican Republic to the UK is via Miami in 
Florida. But Britain wanted to avoid a stopover there to avoid any 
chance of Brown being held by the U.S. authorities, who are also probing
reports of him money laundering.

He
is also wanted in Mallorca on fraud charges, opening the prospect that 
he will be sent back to Spain after completing his sentence in the UK.
