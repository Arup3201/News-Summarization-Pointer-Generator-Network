A new cash-for-questions scandal threatened to engulf Parliament last night after Tory MP Patrick Mercer was snared in a sting operation.

Mr Mercer resigned his party’s whip after he was exposed as having accepted £4,000 to ask Parliamentary questions and lobby on behalf of Fiji.

His resignation came as pictures 
emerged allegedly showing him signing a contract with a fake lobbying 
company set up by journalists.

 from film footage released by BBC Panorama reportedly show the Newark 
MP signing a document during a meeting with an undercover journalist 
posing as a lobbyist.

He was also recorded saying 'Let's sign this, with pleasure'.

The MP for Newark announced that he 
will refer himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and 
will quit the Commons at the next election. But fellow Conservatives and
 campaigners called for him to resign now.

Last night several other MPs and peers were said to be embroiled in the scandal.

Mr Mercer is accused of breaking 
Commons rules by failing to declare the £4,000 payment to the 
Parliamentary authorities in the register of interests.

He was exposed in a sting operation run by the BBC’s Panorama programme and a national newspaper.

They approached him seven weeks ago 
pretending to be from firm called Alistair Andrews Communications 
lobbying on behalf of Fiji.

They requested his help to win 
readmission to the Commonwealth for the Pacific island, which was 
suspended in 2006 after its government was ousted by a military coup.

Friends of former Army officer Mr 
Mercer say he was approached as he has often spoken up on behalf of 
Fijians in the British Army, and because he ‘looked like an easy mark’.

David Cameron faced pressure last night following the Mercer scandal to bring in a right of recall so voters can sack their MPs between elections.

Tory MPs and campaigners said the powers – promised in the Coalition Agreement – are needed to oust those guilty of wrongdoing.

They also urged ministers to set up a long-promised register of lobbyists.

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Mr Mercer’s constituents should have the right to hold him to account for his actions if they feel he has let them down.

'Without a proper right of recall, MPs remain able to sit out a full five-year term, regardless of their conduct.’

Tory MP Douglas Carswell, an advocate of recall votes, said that Mr Cameron’s Policy Unit ‘needs to come up with proposals fast’.

In February 2010, Mr Cameron called lobbying ‘the next big scandal waiting to happen’.

But Coalition pledges to set up a register of lobbyists have so far come to naught.

The MP signed a contract worth £2,000
 a month and put down five Parliamentary questions on Fiji, all of which
 were answered. He should have declared an interest, but did not.

On March 26 he also proposed a 
Commons Early Day motion saying ‘there is no justification for Fiji’s 
continued suspension from the Commonwealth’ and urged the Government ‘to
 arrange a ministerial visit in order to help prepare for and assist its
 readmission’.

He was in the process of setting up an All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fiji.

The scandal is reminiscent of the 
cash-for-questions affair in the 1990s when two Tory MPs accepted money 
in brown paper bags to ask Parliamentary questions. The affair left the 
Conservative Party tainted with ‘sleaze’ for a decade.

Jon Trickett MP, Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: 'David Cameron must now address his failure to act by working with Labour to establish a Statutory Register of Lobbyists.

'We have seen no action from this Tory-led Government, despite David Cameron himself warning that lobbying was the next great scandal waiting to happen.

'The coalition agreement promised action, and cross-party support was offered. However, scandals around "cash for access" continue to be present at the heart of this Government.

'At a time when faith in politics and politicians is at an all time low, we must all be working hard to reinstate confidence in elected representatives and the governmental system.

'Examples such as the allegations heard in the last 24 hours are not good for British politics.'

In a bid to stop the rot, Mr Mercer 
referred himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, said 
he would be resigning the Tory whip for the good of his party and 
announced he would not stand for re-election in 2015.

But last night it appeared that the 
scandal was spreading. The BBC announced that they had put allegations 
of wrongdoing to other MPs and peers.

At least 20 are required to create an
 all-party group and Labour whips in the House of Lords warned their 
peers a week ago that a lobbying sting was in operation.

The resignation was a mixed blessing 
for David Cameron. Mr Mercer, the former commanding officer of the 
Sherwood Foresters regiment, has been one of the Prime Minister’s 
fiercest internal critics since he was sacked as homeland security 
spokesman in 2007 after he said being called a ‘black b*****d’ was a 
normal part of Army life.

Patrick Mercer spent 25 years as an army officer with the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters, serving in Northern Ireland, Uganda, Bosnia and Canada.

As the youngest colonel since the Second World War he left the army in 1999 and soon after joined BBC Radio 4's Today programme as their defence reporter.

He was elected as Tory MP for Newark in 2001, and served on the frontbench under Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Howard and David Cameron.

But he was sacked by Mr Cameron in 2007 for an interview in which he suggested that being called a
 'black b*****d' was a normal part of army life.

He also claimed to have met a lot of 'idle and useless' soldiers from ethnic minorities.

Since then, Mr Mercer has been an outspoken critic of the Tory leader.

In 2011 he was reported to have called Mr Cameron 'an a***' and 'a despicable creature without any real redeeming features'.

A recording obtained by The People 
newspaper suggested he also said of the PM: 'I’ve never, ever come 
across anyone less suited to the job in my life. I would take a beggar 
off the streets and put him in that position rather than have Cameron. I
 loathe him.'

However, Mr Mercer denied the veracity of the account and accused the newspaper of subterfuge.

Since then, Mr Mercer has been 
accused of describing Mr Cameron as a ‘despicable creature without any 
real redeeming features’.

Asked once what the Prime Minister’s biggest 
fault was, Mr Mercer responded: ‘Being born.’ 

But if Mr Mercer is forced to resign 
as an MP, Mr Cameron would be presented with a potentially disastrous 
by-election in an area where the UK Independence Party would fancy its 
chances of picking up its first Westminster seat.

The Prime Minister will also face 
questions about why the Coalition has failed to fulfil pledges to create
 a state register of lobbyists and to give voters the right to ‘recall’ 
MPs who have done wrong.

Critics called for Mr Mercer to retire.

Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted: ‘If 
it’s bad enough for you to resign from your party, how can it be OK to 
continue representing constituents at all?’

TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive 
Matthew Sinclair said: ‘Newark residents will be intrigued as to why 
their MP has resigned from his party but not from Parliament.’

Friends of Mr Mercer said that he had
 not put down the exact Parliamentary questions he had been asked to, 
but had chosen the wording himself.

They also claimed he had refused a 
request to ‘cook the results’ of the All-Party Group report on Fiji in 
order to fix the conclusions.

‘They tried to force his hand and he said 
No,’ one friend added.

Allies said accusations that Mr Mercer had also 
made derogatory comments about Fijian soldiers were ‘rubbish’.

Mr Mercer was approached by Snapper 
TV, a freelance documentary maker working for Panorama, on Tuesday.

He 
discussed the affair with Tory Chief Whip Sir George Young on Thursday 
and suggested to party chiefs that he resign.

Mr Mercer, who is married with a son,
 said: ‘Panorama are planning to broadcast a programme alleging that I 
have broken Parliamentary rules.

'I am taking legal advice about these 
allegations – and I have referred myself to the Parliamentary 
Commissioner for Standards.

‘In the meantime, to save my party 
embarrassment, I have resigned the Conservative Whip. I have also 
decided not to stand at the next General Election.’

David Cameron was informed of the situation while on holiday in Ibiza.

His spokesman said: ‘Patrick Mercer 
has done the right thing in referring himself to the Parliamentary 
Commissioner for Standards and resigning the whip.’
