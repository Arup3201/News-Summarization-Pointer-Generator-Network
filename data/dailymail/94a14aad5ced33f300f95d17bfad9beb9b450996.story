Mike Betts received the money as boss of Motability Operations

A £1million bonus paid to the boss of a firm providing cars for the disabled should be investigated by Parliament, MPs said today.

The payouts to Mike Betts, the chief executive of Motability Operations, could be probed by the Public Accounts Committee over doubts about value for money for taxpayers.

Motability Operations leases various types of vehicle to around 600,000 disabled people. 

It receives their mobility allowances direct from the Department for Work and Pensions.

In the year to September last year Mr Betts was paid a basic salary of £501,900, the Sunday Times reported.

He also received a standard performance bonus of £245,850 and a long-term incentive payment of £666,065, based on 'high levels of customer satisfaction, excellent business culture, lease affordability and renewal levels'. 

There were other unspecified benefits of £24,444.

There is particular criticism because Motability Operations relies on income from disabled people who receive government benefits and choose to spend it on the scheme.

Tory MP Stephen Barclay told the Sunday Times: 'It is difficult to justify a pay packet which is many times greater than that of the prime minister for the chief executive of a not-for-profit company providing cars for the disabled.' 

Labour MP John Mann also objected to the bonus being paid, and called for it to be looked at by the Public Accounts Committee.

Motability Operations is owned by Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland, and overseen by registered charity Motability.

In its annual report, the company boasts that it is guaranteed an income stream with 'minimal credit risk'.

Mr Betts, who has been chief executive since 2003, is the highest-paid director.

There have been concerns raised about the checks made before leasing or selling vehicles under the Motability scheme, with claims friends and family some claimants were using the vehicles for their own use.

Lord Sterling, the chairman and co-founder of the Motability charity, told the newspaper: 'Mike Betts is one of the most able executives I have ever come across. 

'He is worth every penny he is paid. He runs Motability Operations with extremely high service levels which provide empathy and support for its disabled customers well beyond the norm.'

Neil Johnson, chairman of Motability Operations, said: 'Mike Betts is an outstanding [chief executive officer] who has succeeded in leading MotabilityOperations over the last decade transforming the culture to achieve consistently high rates of customer satisfaction and value for money.

'The Motability scheme is unique. I and my board believe an exceptional chief executive is required to continue to ensure the business succeeds in achieving the scale and discipline needed to meet the distinctive needs of disabled people.'
