A fourth book in the Millennium series will be published in 2015, despite author Stieg Larsson passing away nine years ago.

The book will see a new writer taking on Larsson’s mantle to continue the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist and his sidekick Lisbet Salander - The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.

The Millennium trilogy was published posthumously and became a 
world-wide success which made it onto the silver screen twice, both in 
Sweden and Hollywood.

The Girl Who Sold Out? Swedish publishers Nordstedt has announced that there will be a fourth book in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series which saw its heroine translated onto the screen by Noomi Rapace in 2008

Publishers Nordstedt have chosen an 
author for book four and is planning on releasing it in 2015, on the 
tenth anniversary of the first book, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.

‘There will be a new novel. We have thought about it for a while,’ publishing manager Eva Gedin told Aftonbladet.

All
 three books in the Millennium series were published after Stieg 
Larsson’s death and he never got to experience the immense success of 
his work, which was turned into a Hollywood film in 2011 with Bond-actor
 Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander.

Eva Gabrielsson, Stieg Larsson's partner of 32 years, was shocked to find out about the new book.

'I think it is a bit greedy. It's already a billion-pound industry,' she told Aftonbladet.

'It is distasteful to try to make more money.'

The Millennium trilogy was published posthumously and quickly became a bestseller in Europe and the U.S.

The Girl With The Actual Book: Eva Gabrielsson, Stieg Larsson's partner of 32 years, has hit back at the new book calling the publishers 'greedy' and maintain she still has Stieg's original script for a fourth book - which will not be part of the new release

Eva has previously confirmed that she 
has the laptop which contains the first half of a fourth book, written 
by Stieg Larsson before his death.

However,
 she says publishers Nordstedt have not had access to the original 
script and will have to start from scratch with a new book.

Ms
 Gabrielsson and Stieg Larsson met as teenagers in their home town of 
Umea during a protest against the Vietnam war. They were together for 
more than three decades but although Stieg proposed in 1983, they never 
married.

As a result of the nature of his work as a journalist and editor of anti-fascist magazine Expo, Stieg and Eva both received death threats and not registering their partnership was a precaution to ensure their home would be harder to find in official records.

 in 2004 when he had to walk up seven flights of stairs to his office 
when the lift broke.

The
 only resemblance of a will was one written in the 70s promising all his
 money to the Communist Worksers’ Party in Umea. It was never witnessed 
and was dismissed.

The 
rights to his work, the revenue from the books and the subsequent film 
deals in Sweden and in Hollywood, as well as half of the flat the couple
 shared in Stockholm, went to Stieg’s estranged father and brother.

Ms Gabrielsson has been involved in a public and infected legal battle over her partner’s legacy ever since.

David Lagercrantz, most famous for writing Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimiovic's biography 'I am Zlatan', is already writing on book four.

He says the continuation of the Millennium series is 'necessary'

'We know all these characters, Blomkvist and Salander, are so incredibly full of life. They deserve to live. It is a form of respect for his authorship. A respect in that his life’s work is being allowed to live on,’ he told Aftonbladet.

The fourth Millennium book is planned to be published in Swedish in august 2015.
