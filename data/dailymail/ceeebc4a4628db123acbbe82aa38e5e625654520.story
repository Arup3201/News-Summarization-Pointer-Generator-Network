Cilla Black has backed her friend Sir Cliff Richard as he prepares to be questioned by police over a historic allegation of sexual assault.

The singer and former Blind Date presenter came out in support of Sir Cliff after police raided his £3million apartment in Sunningdale, Berkshire last week.

Sir Cliff is currently on holiday in the Algarve, but is preparing to return home to the UK where he is expected to be questioned by officers over an accusation that he sexually assaulted a boy under 16 at a Christian rally in Sheffield in 1985.

Cilla Black, pictured with Sir Cliff Richard at Wimbledon this year, has come out in defence of her friend, insisting she is 'absolutely positive' he is innocent of claimed sexual abuse

In a strongly worded statement released today, Cilla Black said she is 'absolutely positive' he is innocent.

She said: 'Cliff is a very close friend of mine and has been for a million years.

'I, like everyone else, was shocked to hear of these allegations and I am absolutely positive that they are without foundation.'

The pair have been close friends since they recorded a song together in 1969 and are regularly spotted enjoying the tennis at Wimbledon.

Miss Black's defence of her friend came after Sir Cliff held a five-hour meeting with his lawyers in Portugal ahead of his planned return to Britain to face police questioning over an allegation of sexual assault.

The 73-year-old is currently on holiday in the Algarve and has hired Max Clifford’s lawyer, Ian Burton, of law firm BCL Burton Copeland, to represent him as he vows to clear his name.

It was announced today that the singer has pulled out of a planned appearance at a charity event at Canterbury Cathedral after finding himself at the centre of the police probe.

His spokesman said he would not be attending the event, planned for September 26, as he 'doesn’t want the event to be overshadowed by the false allegation and has therefore withdrawn'.

The statement adds: 'He is sorry for any disappointment or inconvenience caused.'

Sir Cliff is yet to hear from detectives, even though police have stated publicly for five days that they want to speak to him.

He
 reacted with fury last Thursday after learning that police were 
searching his Berkshire home as a BBC filmed live, when he had no prior 
notice.

Mr Burton has represented a string of high profile clients, including late singer Amy Winehouse, former Harrods owner Mohamed al Fayed and jockey Kieren Fallon.

He was hired by Clifford after the publicist was accused of a series of sexual assaults. Clifford was jailed for eight years earlier this year. 

Sir Cliff's meeting with lawyers came as it emerged the BBC and the police chief in charge of the Sir Cliff Richard investigation are to be hauled before MPs over their treatment of the star.

South Yorkshire chief constable David Crompton and BBC director general Lord Hall face a grilling over the decision to screen live television images of the singer’s £3million home being raided.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, has written to both demanding to know how the BBC found out about the search by detectives investigating a historical allegation of sexual abuse on a boy under 16 and whether police were bounced into acting under BBC pressure.

South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright has announced an independent review after calling Mr Crompton to a meeting yesterday.

The BBC has received 477 complaints about its coverage of the raid amid an avalanche of criticism from celebrities, politicians and leading lawyers, who have dubbed it a ‘witch-hunt’ and accused the BBC of blackmailing police into going public.

More than 200 viewers were concerned over how the BBC found out about the search and was present while it was carried out, and 73 complained that its reporting suggested Sir Cliff was guilty.

The BBC also received 197 complaints that there has been too much coverage of the allegations against the singer.

Former BBC journalist Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, has described it as a ‘witch-hunt’, attacking the BBC for an ‘error of judgment’.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘What the BBC has done amounts to blackmail. This is shocking behaviour by a publicly funded national broadcaster.’

Mr Crompton and Lord Hall have been warned they are likely to be summoned before the Home Affairs Committee when Parliament returns from recess in September.

Mr Vaz has sent a list of questions he wants answered by midday on Friday.

He wants the BBC to reveal how and when it found out about the highly sensitive police inquiry, and whether the information came from a police source.

South Yorkshire Police has already admitted striking a deal where the BBC was given exclusive information in advance and allowed to film the raid.

The force said it had been ‘reluctant’ to co-operate but believed if it did not, the BBC would run the story anyway.

Former Policing Minister Nick Herbert said both the police and the BBC had 'serious questions' to answer

The police may have acted corruptly if they let the BBC know they were going to raid Sir Cliff Richard's home, a former policing minister has said.

Nick Herbert said that South Yorkshire police and the BBC needed to explain how the raid on Sir Cliff's home in Berkshire was able to be filmed live on TV.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘I think there are serious questions to answer both on the part of the police about how this information got into the public domain, but also by the BBC for its editorial judgment in the way it then interacted with the police and decided that it was appropriate for instance to send a helicopter and film these events.’

He added: ‘If South Yorkshire Police say that it was not them that tipped off the BBC, something the BBC has confirmed, then I accept that.

‘But somebody tipped off the BBC and it's difficult to believe that that wasn't somebody who was in some way connected with these investigations. So it might have been another force.

‘If that person provided information to the BBC for payment, then that is corruption. If they did it simply because they wished to ingratiate themselves with the BBC then that is quite clearly ethically wrong and contrary to the new College of Policing code of ethics.’

It has written an official letter of complaint to Lord Hall, accusing the Corporation of breaking its guidelines.

But Mr Crompton is under pressure to reveal when his force confirmed the timing of the raid and whether the plans changed.

Former 
Attorney General Dominic Grieve suggested that the force’s ‘very 
questionable’ handling of the case may have contravened national 
policing guidelines which say suspects should not be named before being 
charged unless it has a ‘policing purpose’ such as protecting the public
 or preventing crime.

Lord
 Macdonald of River Glaven, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, 
described the police decision to liaise with the BBC as 'inexcusable'.

He
 told the Times: 'To use the search of premises in a serious and very 
sensitive investigation of a high-profile figure as an excuse to set up a
 major press event, I think it's unforgivable.'

Sir Cliff Richard, with his friend John McElynn, has not been asked for an interview by South Yorkshire Police nor even been contacted by them

Former shadow home secretary David Davis said: ‘The extraordinary decision by the leadership of South Yorkshire Police to allow the searching of Sir Cliff Richard’s house to be televised, like some morally-challenged reality TV show, demonstrates there is something sick at the heart of Britain’s police and justice system.’

Human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson accused officers of ‘treating Cliff Richard as though he were a bank robber or a mass murderer’.

Last night the BBC said it would respond to South Yorkshire Police’s letter ‘in due course’.

A spokesman added: ‘Mr Vaz understands and supports the right of the media to report matters in the public interest. The BBC's editorial independence is protected by our Royal Charter and is highly valued by the public.

'The BBC does not name its sources nor is it appropriate to go into detail around editorial processes.'
