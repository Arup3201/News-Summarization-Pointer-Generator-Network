Hillary Clinton's fellow Democrats smell blood in the water after her recent gaffes over her considerable wealth and they began pouncing on the presidential hopeful on Monday.

Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic Party chairman in South Carolina, framed his insult in terms the fictional aristocratic Crawley family and their servants could understand.

'I don't know whether it’s just that she’s been "Madam Secretary" for so long, but she’s generating an imperial image,' Harpootlian told The Washington Post.

'She’s been living 30, going on 40 years with somebody bringing your coffee to you every morning. Is it more Downton Abbey than it is America?'

Not 'truly well off': Clinton is having a nightmare of a PR week after self-inflicted wounds about her $200,000 speeches and her multiple mansions

Lady Hillary? Her silver-spoon lifestyle is opening up the former first lady and secretary of state to charges that she's living a 'Downton Abbey' lifestyle that Americans won't recognize in 2016

Harpootlian, like more than half of the Democratic establishment, backed President Barack Obama in his epic battle with Hillary for the 2008 presidential nomination.

He's also an ally of Vice President Joe Biden, who took his cue Monday morning and asked the audience at the White House's 'Working Families Summit' to cut him some slack because his personal wealth falls short of the Clintons'.

'Don't hold it against me that I don't own a single stock or bond,' Biden said. 'Don't hold it – I have no savings accounts. But I got a great pension and I get a good salary.'

He declared himself 'the poorest man in Congress.' As vice president, Biden officially presides over the U.S. Senate and can cast tie-breaking votes.

Biden's financial disclosures suggest a net worth of around $800,000, enough to put him in America's often derided '1 per cent.'

But Bill and Hillary Clinton's balance sheet has been estimated at between $50 and $100 million.

The former first lady and secretary of state told the Guardian this weekend that she is 'unlike a lot of people who are truly well off.'

And last week she tripped over her wallet during what was supposed to be a political coming-back-out party in conjunction with a book release, explaining how she and the former president had struggled to afford mortgages on their estates.

'Their estates – more than one,' CNN anchor Alison Kosik giggled Monday morning while reporting the story.

'I don’t know what to do with my millions,” co-host Miguel Marquez jabbed back. 'It’s very tough.'

The Clintons own several homes, including this three-storey house in Washington DC. The average home in the neighborhood is valued at $6,586,000, according to real estate website Trulia

Clinton's handlers have done a substandard job of managing her image this year, setting up ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer with a tour of her $5 million Washington, D.C. home and its lush, Edwardian interiors.

'Swimming pools and Ming vases are just not going to resonate with working stiffs,' an Obama White House insider told MailOnline on Monday. 'Unless half the voters hit the lottery next year, they're just not going to be excited about her.'

Another told the Post that wealth is 'going to be a massive issue for her. When you're somebody like the secretary of state or president of the United States or first lady, you’re totally cut off [from normal activity], so your perception of the middle-class reality gets frozen in a time warp.'

Asked what Democrats should do, the adviser said: 'Panic.'

Obama's inner circle, like Joe Biden, is feeling in the dark for levers of power to move after Obama leaves office. And given the president's legendary feuds with the Clintons, Hillary represents a door slammed on them in the future.

'I hate that man Obama more than any man I've ever met, more than any man who ever lived,' Bill Clinton once said of Obama after he suggested in 2008 that the former president was a racist, according to a new book.

And Obama angered Bill Clinton by suggesting that Michelle Obama would make just as appealing a presidential candidate as Hillary Clinton.

With their party's most enduring marriage of convenience falling apart, the Obamas are free to cut the Clintons loose – and Hillary is left to defend herself.

'Whoever thinks she has lost touch is clearly not in touch with her or her long-held beliefs,' Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told the Post.

'If they were, they’d know that reducing inequality and increasing upward mobility has been an uninterrupted pursuit of hers through every job she’s held and continues to this day in her work at the Clinton Foundation.'

She hasn't, however, driven a car in 18 years, bringing to mind the media-created 1992 frenzy when then-President George H.W. Bush seemed disconnected from ordinary Americans when he saw a demonstration of a new kind of grocery scanner technology.

'Every time that she tries to talk in some populist voice, it’s completely inauthentic,' former George W. Bush strategist Matthew Dowd told the Post.

'At a time when the country is anti-Washington and anti-Wall Street, she represents both.'
