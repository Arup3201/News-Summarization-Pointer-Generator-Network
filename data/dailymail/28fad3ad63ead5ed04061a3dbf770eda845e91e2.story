The National Football League sold prints online of a football player's obscene gesture after fining the athlete thousands of dollars for doing it.

Earlier this week, the NFL fined Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch $20,000 for grabbing his crotch after a touchdown in the National Football Conference championship game  on Jan. 18.

The NFL fined the player and threatened to give the Seahawks a 15-yard penalty if Lynch performed his infamous crotch grab during Super Bowl XLIX, according to NBC Sports.

The NFL was quick and strict in punishing the athlete, but meanwhile has been selling a framed photograph of the gesture online at its NFL Shop.

The League has made a profit off of the crotch grab while Lynch has been forced to pay.

On the NFL Shop website, a photograph of the crotch grab is seen along with four other photographs in a collage commemorating the Seahawks as the 2014 NFC Champions.

The 20-by-24-inch print was listed at $149.95. 

The news about the League's action spread sparking outrage.

Tweet: One Twitter user tweeted 'Let me get this straight, @nfl fines @MoneyLynch for crotch grab, then turns around and sells photos of it?' -- Lynch retweeted it

For Sale: An NFL spokesperson told ESPN Sunday that the photo of Lynch's (photographed) crotch grab 'should not have been for sale'

One Twitter user tweeted 'Let me get this straight, @nfl fines @MoneyLynch for crotch grab, then turns around and sells photos of it?' -- Lynch retweeted it.

An NFL spokesperson told ESPN Sunday that the photo of the crotch grab 'should not have been for sale,' ESPN reports.

The NFL's website now shows that the framed collage is 'Out of Stock.' 

'Any play that results in a fine may not be used commercially,' the spokesperson said.
