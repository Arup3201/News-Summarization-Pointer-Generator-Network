Terrified of water and screaming at the sound of rain, they were just some of the thousands of children whose lives were devastated by the Boxing Day tsunami.

Crammed into tents, many were mute and in shock after losing their entire families and seeing their villages flattened and flooded.

For Nizma Scoffield there was only one option, to set up an orphanage to give as many children as possible, marooned by the tsunami and without any relatives, a home.

Ten years on the British charity worker is celebrating helping raise more than 100 children through the orphanage, who have gone on from the crisis to work, study at university and get married.

'There were too many orphans when the tsunami happened, too many children with no parents - that's why we decided to set up the orphanage,' said Mrs Scoffield. 

Mrs Scoffield, who was born in Indonesia and has two children, came to London 34 years ago and married an Englishman. 

But after she saw what had happened on Boxing Day in Indonesia she decided to fly there to help. 

She was able to get a flight three weeks after the disaster and set up Chariots for Children to help orphans, with the help of British donations. 

The orphanage she set up, located in Paroy village, Lhoong on the Aceh coast of Indonesia, initially housed 50 children who lost their families in the catastrophe and has gone on to give a home to more in the 10 years since the crisis. 

The British charity worker flew out to Indonesia three weeks after the tsunami to help the orphaned children 

The tsunami flattened homes and communities in Indonesia and left 30,000 children completely orphaned 

When she arrived in Indonesia Mrs Scoffield was greeted by dead bodies piled next to rubble and others hanging from the trees - making it impossible to navigate roads by motorbike.  

The charity worker visited tents packed with orphans severely traumatised by the tsunami and with nobody to look after them.

'It was devastating - I could not even cry the first time I got there, the destruction and the damage was massive,' she said. 

'We tried to entertain them by singing together, drawing and giving them presents and books - when I heard them laugh it nearly broke my heart.

The orphanage initially gave homes to 50 children orphaned by the crisis and has taken more in the 10 years 

Dozens of children like these boys were given a stable home at the orphanage after losing all their relatives 

'We went to find girls and boys, they were all mixed up and some of them wouldn't speak.

'We chose those that didn't have family left, that really needed our help, we heard some of them scream at night.'

Mrs Scoffield moved 30 boys and 20 girls into a rented house while she searched for land to build them a home.

'The children were scared by water and the sound of rain and had nightmares when they slept,' she added.

The orphanage is nestled between two hills and only accessible by motorbike. It cost around £3,000 to buy 8,000 square meters of land in the hills above the coast and another £85,000 to build the orphanage that stands there today. The funds were mostly raised from communities in England who donated after they saw the devastation left in the wake of the tsunami.

The charity worker hopes to continue her work and run the orphanage as a campus where children can study

Mrs Scoffield added: 'We went to Lhoong because it was cut off, we tried by motorbike but there was dead bodies hanging from trees so we went by boat.

'I would travel back from Asia to talk about Indonesia and the children there and to raise more money to build the children a home, and to keep them clothed and fed.'

Ten years later the orphans have grown up to lead successful lives. The men have become teachers and businessmen and the girls have got married and are studying at college.

Mrs Scoffield has lost contact with many of the children she has helped over the years, but has managed to keep in touch with a few. 

The oprhanage is located in Paroy Village in Lhoong and initially had 30 boys and 20 girls staying there 

It cost around £3,000 to buy the land needed for the orphanage and about £85,000 to develop the building 

Much of the funds raised for the orphanage building to give children a home came from British donations 

The view from the village in Paray in Indonesia was a lot calmer in 2011 than after the tsunami in 2004 

One of these children is Nina.

She was was just ten years old when, clinging to a coconut tree, she watched as her mother was swept away by the tsunami. Rescued and taken in by the Chariots for Children team, Nina spent her teenage years at the orphanage and is now studying at university.

Nina now lives in the regional capital of Aceh - but is still terrified by earthquakes and the mention of death.

Mrs Scoffield said: 'When I saw her again I just stared at her with amazement, she looks so grown up and tall, I just wanted to hug and kiss her.

Mrs Scoffield has spoken of her pride in raising more than 100 children in the Indonesian orphanage

'Nina loves maths, physics and chemistry, as well as economics and religious studies.

'She tells me she wants to become a psychologist, to better help her people in the future.'

Mrs Scoffield, from Bromley in London is now raising funds for a new generation of homeless children in Indonesia who she visits every six months. 

The home runs off donations of around £600 a month - which provides food, shelter and tuition for the Indonesian orphans.

The children, most of whom were victims of recent conflict in the country - are taught the national curriculum, play football and practice martial arts.

She said: 'Over the past ten years everything has changed, the US aid came and re-built the road, the houses that were destroyed have been rebuilt and people have started working and trading again.

'Some of the orphanages are empty now, the funding has decreased so much that charities can't afford to run them.

'We would love to invite more children to study there and give them a good future - we would like to be a campus for young people to come and study.'
