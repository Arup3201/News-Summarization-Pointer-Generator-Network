Burnley boss Sean Dyche believes his side's victory over Hull can act as a calling card for their Barclays Premier League credentials.

The Clarets' top-flight return went without a win for the first 10 games of the season but, just as questions were being asked about whether it might stay that way until May, they turned over the Tigers before the international break.

Dyche is too pragmatic a coach to get carried away, especially with his side still propping up the rest of the division, but he is content that the 1-0 success shows Burnley are not out of their depth among the elite.

Burnley boss Sean Dyche said the club set down a marker with their first Premier League win of the season

'One win isn't like we've won the World Cup, one win is us laying a marker down and now we're looking to move it forward,' he said.

'You get that first win and everybody feels a bit better about life.

'That's all we were looking for, that first marker to say we're in the Premier League and we're in here for a reason.

'The players have had a lot of exposure for the wrong reasons this season, with this talk of "could they win a game, when would they win a game?"

'It's all so heavily covered that players can get influenced by that over time. I don't think mine have but they could be.'

Having had a fortnight to reflect on their winning effort at Turf Moor, Dyche takes his side to ninth-placed Stoke on Saturday.

And he is clear about that fact that the first win of the campaign represents the start of the job, not an end in itself.

'It's only one win and we need a lot more,' he said.

'We're bottom of the pile, so we've got to achieve things beyond what we've done so far.

'We're not thinking we're going to roll into town and pick up three points every week but we feel we can be competitive and that win reinforces our beliefs.'

Dyche hopes to have a strong squad to call on at the Britannia Stadium, though striker Sam Vokes is still working his way back from a knee injury that has kept him out since March.

Vokes is back in first-team training but not yet match ready, but there is better news elsewhere.

'We're not defining when Sam will be back but he's going well,' said Dyche.

'Steven Reid is back to what you'd consider full fitness and Nathaniel Chalobah had a knock with the England Under 21s but we don't think that's too serious.

'Dean Marney is back too after a hamstring injury, so the squad is coming back to full health.'
