A judge has denied custody to white supremacist Heath Campbell, the New Jersey man who attended a court hearing last month dressed in a full Nazi uniform as he sought to get back his youngest child.

Campbell, 40, is father to eight children by four different women. He lives off of government assistance and his current fiancee is expecting his ninth child later this year.

He attended the June hearing held at Hunterdon County Family Court in Flemington, N.J., to determine whether he  could visit with his 2-year-old son Heinrich Hons.

Heinrich Hons was the fourth child - all with Nazi-inspired names - that Campbell had with his last wife Deborah. He was removed from his parents just hours 
after being born in November 2011.

The
 New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services said they 
took the boy because violence in the home.

They had already placed the couple's other three children – Adolf Hitler Campbell, 7, JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell, 6,
 and 5-year-old Honzlynn Jeannie Campbell – in foster care because of 
the alleged violence in the family's Holland Township, N.J. home.

The
 couple said they never abused their children and argued they were being
 targeted for the names they chose for their kids.

Campbell has said he will appeal Thursday’s decision, reports NBC 10.

Deborah Campbell gave up rights to her children after separating from her husband.

The Nazi-inspired names first came to light
 after a store refused to decorate a birthday cake reading 'Happy 
birthday Adolf Hitler' in December 2008.

In 2010, a
 New Jersey appeals court ruled there was sufficient evidence of abuse 
or neglect due to prior domestic violence to seize the children.

Authorities insisted putting the children into care had nothing to do with their names.

Court records from previous hearings show that the oldest child, Adolf, frequently threatened to kill people.

Deborah Campbell reportedly had once given a note to her neighbor saying she
 was terrified of her husband, who had threatened to kill her.

The 40-year-old white supremacist appeared at last month's hearing in knee-high black boots and swastika patches and was accompanied by his latest fiancee Bethanie Rose Zito.

Days after the hearing Campbell proposed to her in front 
of a water fountain in Easton, Pennsylvania, once again dressed in full Nazi 
regalia. Both have swastika tattoos on their necks.

The 40 year old, whose body is covered in swastika tattoos and who heads a neo-Nazi group, told the Daily News that he isn't taking any chances with the birth of his next child.

'In July, I’m shipping [my fiancée] to a neo-Nazi compound down South,' he told the Daily News. 'There’s no way in the 
world they’re going to find out where this child is.'

The couple are expecting a baby girl and are planning to name her Eva Braun after HItler's long-time 
girlfriend who married him just 40 hours before 
they both committed suicide.
