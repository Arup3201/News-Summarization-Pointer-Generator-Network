As people across Australia relaxed after a day of festive over indulgence, one man was enduring perhaps the most miserable Christmas Day ever after becoming stranded on his jetski in the middle of a lake.

The 28-year-old experienced jetskier had set off for a simple 4.5km ride on Lake Hume on the Victorian/New South Wales border, near his hometown of Albury, when his Christmas day went drastically wrong.

The man’s friends become worried and reported him missing to police after he failed to return from the 15-minute ride by 8.00pm after setting off at 6.30pm.

Lake Hume Coast Guard set out to rescue the man on Boxing Day after he was located after spending 12 hours on the lake overnight 

He spent the whole night in the middle of the lake, shivering on his jet ski, after it broke down and was miraculously rescued 12 hours later at 6.40am on Boxing Day.

After being spotted by his friends, Lake Hume Coast Guard set out to retrieve him and his jet ski.

Lake Hume Coast Guard Deputy Commander, Kevin Ellison, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘He was found this morning and he was reasonably well… He'd been out in the cold all night.’

His jet ski floated to the middle of Lake Hume after its engine broke down 

The local man from Albury, NSW, is said to be in good spirits after being rescued 

Victoria Police Sergeant Damian Bould said: ‘He was found so quickly because he did the right thing by staying with his vessel.

‘He did not have a personal location beacon with him, which we strongly recommend. ‘If he had not of stayed with his vessel, and attempted to swim his way back we may not have had this great outcome.’

Sergeant Bould warned: ‘With the summer season upon us people need to be very aware of water safety.’

Police said he was not injured and is in good spirits.
