Firebrand: Omar Bakri has been arrested in Lebanon after authorities in the country cracked down on radical Salafist preachers

The radical Islamist cleric Omar Bakri who is said to have once described the July 7 bombers as the Fantastic Four was arrested in Lebanon yesterday.

Bakri, 54, was the spiritual leader of banned extremist group Al-Muhajiroun and lived in London where he was known as the Tottenham Ayatollah.

He went on the run in Lebanon last month following a raid on his house in a crackdown on radical clerics following a spate of car bombs, shootings and assassinations.

He was arrested by security forces in the eastern town of Aley.

Bakri was sentenced to life in Lebanon in 2010 following a terrorism conviction, but was released on bail after witnesses recanted their testimony.

The 54-year-old sparked controversy in UK over his inflammatory language including calling for young British Muslims to take up arms and join Al Qaeda.

After travelling to the Lebanon nine years ago he was refused re-entry to the UK. Since then he has faced repeated investigation by the Security Services in that country.

He went on the run last months following a raid on his house in the wake of a crackdown on radical clerics in the country.

Local media reports on Saturday suggested intelligence officers raided a house on a retreat in the early hours on Mount Lebanon.

In March he told The Daily Mail when speaking of the troubles in Tripoli ‘only jihad salafi can save it and save Lebanon’.

He added: ‘This country needs to be made an Islamic state, obviously ... but I know the security services are getting ready to nab me soon’.

The radical Islamic cleric was placed under house arrest after he was released from jail shortly after arriving in war-torn Lebanon in 2005. It was reported that Bakri referred to the four suicide bombers who killed 56 people on July 7 as ‘the fantastic four’.

He said the British people were to blame for the terror attacks on the capital because they ‘did not make enough effort to stop its own government committing its own atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan’.

He also sparked outrage when he said on TV that he would not inform police if he knew Muslims were planning a bomb attack on a train in the UK and supported Muslims who attacked British troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.

More recently there were reports he issued a ‘fatwa’ against Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai who he said ‘should be sentenced to death’.

Bakri denies being an Al Qaeda leader, while openly praising the terrorist organisation including its leadership.

He came to attention in 2004 when he led a demonstration outside the US Embassy in London in which protesters chanted the name of Osama bin Laden and torched an American flag.
