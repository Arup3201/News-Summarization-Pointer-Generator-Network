More than 9,500 staff worked at the Nazi German death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau - thousands more than previous estimates.

According to the Institute of National Remembrance the group all worked at the camp in occupied Poland between 1940 and 1945.

The Institute, which prosecutes Nazi and Stalinist-era war crimes, said until now it was thought only between 4,000 and 6,500 people worked at Auschwitz.

Yahoo reports that a historian compiled the names for the institute's probe into the day-to-day operations of the camp in the southern city of Oswiecim.

The list will reportedly be published in about a year and will be shared with the German office investigating Nazi war crimes.

Institute prosecutor Lukasz Gramza said: 'I hope it doesn't take years. We're in the process of checking whether the individuals on the list are still alive and that's why it has to remain under wraps for now.' 

About 1.1 million people died at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp between 1940 and 1945. About one million were thought to have been European Jews.
