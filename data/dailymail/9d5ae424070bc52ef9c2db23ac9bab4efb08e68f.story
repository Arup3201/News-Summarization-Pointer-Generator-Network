The mother of Stephen Lawrence was honoured yesterday following her long fight for justice.

Doreen Lawrence was given a standing ovation as she received a special award at the Women of the Year ceremony.

She was praised for her courage and tenacity during her tireless campaign against racism following the murder of her son in 1993.

Stephen was just 18 when he was stabbed to death by a gang of white thugs at a bus stop in Eltham, South-East London.

His mother bravely fought for justice and in January this year Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, were convicted of the murder.

Singer Beverley Knight, who presented Mrs Lawrence’s award, said: ‘It is a joy to present such a quietly courageous, determined and humble woman with an award.

‘I have admired her for years – the grace with which she has dealt with injustice after cruel injustice on both sides of the law to eventually see some resolution.

‘She is the embodiment of the saying, “Never give up”.’

Yesterday’s award was the latest in a series of accolades for Mrs Lawrence, 59, who founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust to help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

In 2003, she was awarded an OBE for services to community relations and this summer was chosen as a flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony of the Olympics, alongside boxer Muhammad Ali and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.

Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, president of the Women of the Year awards, said Mrs Lawrence had ‘campaigned tirelessly for the victims of racist crime and reform of the police service’.

Britain’s female Olympic and Paralympic stars were also winners at the awards, and crime writer PD James was given the lifetime achievement honour.

More than 30 British Olympic and Paralympic medallists – including swimmer Rebecca Adlington and gymnast Beth Tweddle – attended the ceremony in central London.

Lindsay Nicholson, of Good Housekeeping magazine, who presented an award to the sports stars, said: ‘London 2012 was, undeniably, “the Women’s Olympics”.

Our incredible Olympians and Paralympians broke new records and won more medals than ever before.

But, for me, most importantly they sent out a message to all young women that there is so much more to aspire to, physically, than being size zero.’

Women’s rights activist Zainab Salbi and Alzheimer’s campaigner Kate Woolveridge were also named as Women of the Year winners.
