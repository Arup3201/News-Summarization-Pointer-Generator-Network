Former Liverpool star Luis Garcia has backed Diego Costa to overcome his injury worries and star in the Champions League final.

Atletico Madrid's talisman is a major doubt for Saturday's showpiece against cross-city rivals Real.And Garcia - who starred for Atletico in two spells either side of his time at Anfield - believes his former side will wait until the last minute to confirm his availability.

'He's a fighter. He won't miss this game for anything in the world. He'll try his best,' said Garcia.

'If he's fit it's because he can do a good job. Hopefully he can make it, because Atletico need him. He's a key player.

'They will wait until just before kick-off to see if he's fit or not.'

Garcia also heaped praise on Atletico boss Diego Simeone, who leads his side in the Lisbon final having already won La Liga.

Garcia said: 'I would like to be inside the dressing room to know how he's handled everything.

'It's been very difficult fighting against Real and Barcelona and Atletico was always there. He's done an amazing job.

'Man to man Real Madrid is stronger, but that's not the most important thing in a final.

'Everyone
 knows how important the 10th European cup is to Real Madrid so Atletico
 know if they win they can be at the top for a few years.'
