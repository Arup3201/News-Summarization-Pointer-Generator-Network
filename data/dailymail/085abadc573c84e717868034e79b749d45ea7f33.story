A Labour minister has blasted the Government's £2million television campaign encouraging healthier diets as an 'insult' when record numbers now rely on food banks.

The Change4Life advert, made by the creators of Wallace and Gromit, exposes the 'hidden nasties' in everyday foods and airs tonight on ITV during the Coronation Street advert break.

Diane Abbott MP, Labour’s shadow public health minister, called it 'an insult to 
hard-pressed British families' and blamed the government for 'glossing over the real problems'.

Diane Abbott MP, Labour's shadow public health minister, called it 'an insult to hard-pressed British families' and blamed the government for 'glossing over the real problems'.

The Change4Life 'ad takeover', marks the launch of a new year healthy eating drive and will feature ads from Asda, Quorn, Uncle Ben's, the Co-Operative Food and Cravendale

Defrost oneFrozen fruit and veg counts. It only takes a couple of minutes to microwave some frozen peas.Open oneCanned fruit and veg counts too. So get busy with the tin opener. Choose canned fruit and veg in its own juice, which is healthier than eating fruit canned in sugary syrup or veg canned in added salt and sugar.Chop oneFruit can be fun for kids. Peel it, slice it, make shapes with it. Make it easy to enjoy.Pack oneA piece of fruit or veg can help cheer up a lunchbox. Try carrot sticks, baby tomatoes or a banana with a face drawn on the skin.Sprinkle oneIt’s easy to add fresh, frozen or canned fruit and veg to meals. Try sprinkling sweetcorn or pineapple chunks on top of a pizza.Add oneTry grated or chopped carrots in spag bol, or throw tasty veg in to a sauce. There are lots of suggestions of how to include more fruit and veg in your every day cooking here.Snack on oneFresh and dried fruit counts. Try raisins or dried apricots - they make a great healthy treat. It’s also a good idea to pack some healthy snacks for when you’re out and about and the kids get peckish.Pulse oneLentils, beans and peas are all pulses that count towards 5 A DAY and they can easily be added to stews and salads.

‘This £2million that Tory Ministers are spending is an insult to 
hard-pressed British families, when record numbers of people are relying
on food banks, and the government’s own policies to tackle obesity are 
proving to be a disaster,' she said.

‘We need more than half-baked corporate responsibility deal schemes, because the government has a growing crisis on its hands. 

'We’re seeing dinner ladies axed in their thousands, healthy school 
meals on their way out, and the government’s ‘responsibility deal’ 
partnership with their friends in big business is failing.

'So it’s not right that the government is blowing money on 
advertising annual supermarkets discounts, and glossing over the serious
problems British families are being pushed towards.’

Her comments come after the Trussell Trust charity said a record number of people received emergency food from UK food banks last year.

'Its food bank network had fed almost 110,000 people since April 2012, compared with a total of 128,697 in the whole of 2011-12.

The Change4Life 'ad takeover’, marks the launch of a new year healthy eating drive 
and will feature ads from Asda, Quorn, Uncle Ben’s, the Co-Operative 
Food and Cravendale.

The ad slot is the centrepiece of the campaign that encourages the 
public to think about the ‘hidden nasties’ in everyday foods so they can
better manage the amount of salt, fat and sugar in their diets.  

The campaign reminds viewers that there are 11 lumps of sugar in a can of 
cola and that a large takeaway pepperoni 
pizza has two times the recommended maximum daily intake of saturated 
fat.

The Change4Life campaign launches this evening during the advert break between ITV's Coronation Street

Labour Party politician Diane Abbott says the country needs more than 'half-baked ideas'

Its website includes a range of healthy eating tools and information from recipes to money-off  vouchers.

Last week Abbott said she was looking at planning legislation to make it easier for local 
authorities to ban McDonald's and chicken and chip shops
that cluster around schools, and end the sale of cheap alcohol from corner shops.

In conjunction with the campaign there will be hundreds of offers on 
healthier products at more than 1,000 ASDA, ALDI and the Co-Operative 
Food stores across the country to help with the cost of kitchen cupboard
basics.

Everyone that signs up to the campaign will get a free ‘Food Smart Meal 
Mixer’ with lots of quick, easy, healthier recipes with enough 
combinations to eat a different daily menu every day for six years.

Public Health Minister Anna Soubry said: 'Making healthier, balanced 
meals on a budget can be a challenge for families. This new Change4Life 
campaign offers families free healthy recipes and money off those much 
needed cupboard essentials to encourage everyone to try healthy 
alternatives.

'Thanks to the continuing success of Change4Life, a million mums have 
changed their behaviour.  But England has one of the highest rates of 
obesity in Europe with over 60 per cent of adults and a third of 10 and 
11 year olds overweight or obese.

'We want to make it easy for everyone to keep track of what they eat and
make healthier choices. That is why we are also developing a simple and
clear system for front of pack labelling that everyone can use.”

Obesity costs the NHS £5 billion each year with 40,000 people dying of 
conditions attributable to being overweight or obese. And the latest 
figures show that the number of children who are overweight or obese 
doubles during primary school.
