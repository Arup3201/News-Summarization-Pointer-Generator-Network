Rick Perry announced today that he is dropping out of the Republican presidential bid after continually poor rankings and debate performances.

‘There is no viable path forward for me in this 2012 campaign therefore today I am suspending my campaign and endorsing Newt Gingrich,’ he said at an 11am press conference in North Charleston, South Carolina.

'I've discovered this tremendous purpose and resiliency of our people. They haven't stopped believing in the promise of America. They never stopped believing in the American dream...What's broken in America is not our people: it's our politics.

'I ran for president because I love America. I love the people, I love the freedom.

Saluting his supporters at the press conference today, Rick Perry announced that he was stopping his bid for president because he no longer has a 'viable path' to win

'Humbled': Shortly after Perry's announcement, Gingrich said he was honored and humbled by the endorsement

'The conservative philosophy 
transcends any one individual and will live long past any of us,' he 
said, clearly signalling that he was preparing to endorse one of his 
other competitors.

'Newt is not perfect, but who among us is,' Mr Perry said during his endorsement.

The
 boost that Mr Gingrich will receive from Mr Perry's endorsement- though
 it may not be very large- may be all that is needed to bring the former
 speaker into fighting reach of front-runner Mitt Romney.

Mr
 Perry has a strong base of evangelical Christian supporters, and that 
is one group that Mr Gingrich has had trouble connecting with due to his
 complicated personal history. There were clear overtones of religious 
approval in Mr Perry's speech of Mr Gingrich, perhaps as a signal to 
values-voters that they should vote for the former speaker.

Even before the formal announcement, there were rumblings that he would 
endorse Mr Gingrich as the Perry campaign 
took down their anti-Gingrich website early Thursday morning.

Mr Gingrich followed Mr Perry's endorsement with his own press conference highlighting his connection to Mr Perry.

Dropping out: Mr Perry's announcement comes just two days before the South Carolina primary

'He has been a great patriot,' Mr 
Gingrich said in response to Mr Perry's announcement. Mr Gingrich was 
apparently honored and humbled by the endorsement.

Mr Gingrich then said that he has asked Mr Perry to head up a
 10th Amendment enforcement project, which will place emphasis on 
constitutionality clause. The project is reportedly something that the 
two men have discussed for years and will be a way for Mr Perry to 
remain active on a national scale while stepping back from the 2012 
race. 

After announcing his bid for president on August 11, Rick Perry was seen as a conservative godsend for Republican voters.

He reached a record-high of 31.8 per cent in national polls a month later, but his campaign only went down from there.

The
 veritable 'nail in the coffin' came at the televised CNBC debate in 
Rochester, Michigan on November 9 when Mr Perry forgot one of his major 
campaign platforms.

Mr 
Perry continually lambasted the size and over-reach of the federal 
government, and he campaigned saying that he would abolish three federal
 departments as soon as he took office.

When
 asked about that decision at the debate, he took over a minute to 
remember the three agencies before finally just saying 'Oops... I 
forgot'.

Though he 
remained in fourth place immediately after that debate, the space 
between he and third-place Newt Gingrich continued to widen.

Front-runner Mitt Romney made very brief remarks about the news as he was leaving a campaign event.

'He's a great conservative, a great governor,' Mr Romney said.

'We'll miss him on the stage tonight,' he said referring to the last debate in South Carolina before the Saturday primary.

While the news of Mr Perry's suspension does come a as a surprise
 as the South Carolina primary is only two days away, it is not a 
complete shock as his support has been lagging, even reaching its' 
lowest point in recent weeks.

Mr
 Perry will be the second candidate to drop out this week, as Jon 
Huntsman Jr. also cancelled his campaign after 
less-stellar-than-expected performance in New Hampshire. 

Mr Perry has been in last place since 
the New Hampshire primary last Tuesday. He currently only has 4.4 per 
cent of the Republican votes in South Carolina, trailing Rick Santorum 
by 9 points.

He even took a brief trip to his home
 state after the first major primary in Iowa- where he finished in fifth
 place-to talk with advisers and consider whether he would remain in the
 race.

He then decided to stay the course 
but to skip last week's primary in New Hampshire, opting to devote more 
time and resources to South Carolina, where his conservative credentials
 would be more favorable.

Just over a week later, he has clearly reversed that decision.

His
 campaign made no secret of the fact that they were hoping for a strong 
surge in South Carolina as he was seen as a conservative alternative to 
Mormon front runner Mr Romney by appealing to Christian values-voters.

That hasn’t worked, however, and some
 of Mr Perry’s strongest supporters have been calling for an end to his 
campaign in recent weeks.

Erick
 Erickson, founder of popular political blog RedState who started as one
 of the Texan governor’s biggest advocates, announced that he believed 
that Mr Perry’s campaign had to ‘come to an end’. 

Signalling
 a shift even within the state in question, South Carolina state senator
 Larry Grooms- who initially backed Mr Perry- switched and is now 
supporting Santorum.

Unlike the rest of the Republican 
field, Mr Perry was able to highlight his time spent in the Air Force 
during the campaign, and that was thought to be a major advantage going 
into South Carolina because of the state's strong military presence.

Mr Perry's high point in the campaign came in September, when he reached his high with 31.7 per cent of the vote.

One more down: Preparations are being made at the debate site ready for just four candidates

Since
 that initial peak, Mr Perry has continued to plummet in the polls and 
has remained steady with around 6 per cent of Republican voters 
nationally throughout the past month.

He branded himself as the true outsider of the race, never having worked in Washington, D.C. and spending all of his time in Texas state government. 

Mr Perry's campaign took repeated and
 significant blows with many of the televised debates, the worst of 
which was his infamous 'oops' moment when he forgot the names of the 
three government agencies he wished to cut if her were elected. 

Most
 recently he was put on the defensive after saying that Turkey was run 
by Islamic terrorists in Monday night's televised debate. The country 
responded with harsh criticism of the candidate.

'Figures
 who are candidates for positions that require responsibility, such as 
the U.S. presidency, should be more knowledgeable about the world and 
exert more care with their statement,’ the Turkish statement asserted.

The end: Mr Perry appeared relatively optimistic during his frank press conference
