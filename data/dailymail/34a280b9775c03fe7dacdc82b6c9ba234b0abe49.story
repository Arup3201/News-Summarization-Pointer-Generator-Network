Estonia last night claimed one of its policemen had been kidnapped at gunpoint from its territory close to the Russian border in a dramatic new flashpoint between Moscow and the West.

The Cold War-style incident came two days after Barack Obama had warned in a speech in the ex-Soviet state that any attack on a NATO member such as Estonia would be seen as an attack on the alliance in general.

The officer named as Eston Kohver 'was abducted while on duty on Estonian territory by unknown individuals who came from Russia.

He was captured using force at gunpoint,' said Tallinn prosecutors. 

'He was fulfilling his duties preventing cross-border criminal activity. The abductors jammed radio communication and used smoke grenade.'

The alleged abduction took place in southern Estonia near the Luhamaa border crossing with Russia.

Moscow claimed last night that Mr Kohver, 44, was 'detained on Russian territory'.

'A Taurus pistol with cartridges, cash in the amount of 5,000 euros, special equipment for clandestine audio recording, and materials constituting intelligence-gathering instructions have been seized from the offender,' said the FSB, successor to the Soviet-era KGB.

Estonian officials have claimed the police officer, Eston Kohver, was abducted at gunpoint while on their side of  the Luhamaa border crossing with Russia (shown above)

'Kohver was detained, and the necessary investigative procedures have been conducted in relation to him.'

He was engaged in an undercover operation, it was claimed. Last night he was in custody in Russia.
