Argentina superstars including Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez arrived at West Ham's Rush Green training ground to prepare for their international friendly against Croatia on Wednesday.

Former Hammers cult hero Tevez will return to the Boleyn Ground after saving the club from relegation during his controversial spell  in 2006-07 - and could be joined by former team-mate and Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano.

Tevez has been recalled to the Albiceleste squad by coach Gerardo Martino for the first time in nearly three-and-a-half-years after scoring a stunning goal in Juventus' 7-0 demolition of Parma at the weekend.

Tevez and Messi were accompanied by a host of Premier League stars, including Sergio Aguero, Angel Di Maria, Erik Lamela and Pablo Zabaleta, as they were put through their paces in perhaps less salubrious surroundings than they're used it. 

Argentina will be playing in London for the first time since September 2006, when they took on South American rivals Brazil at Arsenal, losing 2-0.

The game against Croatia promises to be exciting with the likes of Real Madrid playmaker Luka Modric, Atletico Madrid striker Mario Mandzukic and Messi's Barcelona team-mate Ivan Rakitic all expected to be involved.
