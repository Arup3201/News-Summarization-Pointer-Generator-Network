A struggling single mother thought she'd been blessed by God when a new friend offered her baby clothes, but authorities say that it was this chance encounter that left Natalia Robert's child an orphan.

Not long before she'd be found dead from a gunshot to the back of the head, Roberts, 30, had called her mother ecstatic over her new friend.

Authorities say those offers were part
 of Catherine Goins' twisted plot to lure Roberts to her death, kidnap her 
two children, and claim them as her own.

Twisted plot: Catherine Goins, 37 (left), is facing murder charges after police say she shot dead mother-of-two Natalia Roberts (right), 30, so she could claim her two children as her own  

Roberts' uncle Benny Robert said his niece believed she had just been given a blessing when the woman who later killed her said she wanted to offer her baby clothes

Lured to her death: Officials say Goins brought Roberts to her ex-boyfriend's house in La Fayette, Georgia, under the pretense of wanting to give her some baby clothes 

Roberts' uncle, Benny Roberts, relayed the sad details of that conversation to The Atlanta Journal Constitution Saturday.

'She called her mother and told her that something real good had just happened,' Benny Roberts told reporters shortly after his niece's funeral.

'She was excited about the baby clothes that had been offered to her and how good God was,' he said.

Law 
enforcement officials in Catoosa County held a press conference 
Wednesday morning unveiling the charges against Goins, 37.

'It was like a made-for-TV movie,' Benny Roberts said.

Goins,
 of Hixson, Tennessee, had pretended she was pregnant and called police 
last Friday claiming she had shot an intruder inside her ex-boyfriend’s 
home.

But an investigation has revealed that Goins’ home invasion story was nothing but a lie concocted to cover up a disturbing abduction plan, Catoosa County Sherif Gary Sisk told reporters, according to the station WRCB

Investigators say Goins met Natalia Roberts, a mother of two, last Friday morning and lured her to the La Fayette home of her former paramour, Tony Richards, claiming she had some baby clothes for her.

When Roberts showed up at 227 Smoketree Circle sometime between 11am and 1pm, Goins allegedly shot her in the back of the head from a .380 caliber handgun as they were walking down a flight of stairs.

Before fleeing the crime scene with the victim's two young children in tow, Goins allegedly tried to cover up her tracks and called her ex-boyfriend, Tony Richards, telling him she had shot someone inside his residence.

'We're calling it murder because that's what it is,' Sheriff Sisks told reporters. 'She flat-out murdered her.'

In cold blood: Sheriff's officials say Goins shot the woman (pictured) in the back of the head and then took off in her car with the victim's two children 

The sheriff added that Catherine Goins’ most recent boyfriend broke up with her after discovering that she had been lying to him about being pregnant, so she decided to present Roberts’ three-week-old baby as her own.

When Tony Richards returned home, he discovered a woman’s lifeless body on his property and called 911. He then contacted Goins, who was fleeing with Roberts’ two children, and convinced to return.

By the time police officers responded to the crime scene, the 37-year-old suspect made her way back to the La Fayette home.

When interviewed by police, Goins reportedly said she was at Richards’ house when she heard a noise. She ran to the bedroom, grabbed a gun and shot at a ‘darkened shadow’ in the hallway, according to Northwest Georgia News.

Catherine Goins was arrested Tuesday in Tennessee on charges of malice murder; felony murder; tampering with evidence, and possessions of a firearm during the commission of a crime.

Natalia Roberts' two children, a 3-year-old and a 3-week old, are currently staying with family members.
