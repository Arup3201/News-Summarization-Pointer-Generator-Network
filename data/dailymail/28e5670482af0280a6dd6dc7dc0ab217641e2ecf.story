A pregnant woman was faced with an agonizing decision whether she should undergo treatment for cancer just three months before giving birth.

Alina Pugel, from Denver, Colorado, was six months into her pregnancy when she received the devastating news that she had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer.

Although the cancer is treatable, she decided to postpone her treatment until her son was born.

Uncertainty: Alina Pugel was six months pregnant when she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer during a checkup with her daughter Sophia. She decided to wait until giving birth before undergoing treatment.

'It was pretty devastating to be pregnant and to have that diagnosis, and you panic,' Alina told KDVR.com on Tuesday.

'When you hear the word cancer, your world falls apart, didn’t want to do anything that would put my baby at risk.'

Doctors at the Rose Thyroid and 
Parathyroid Center of Excellence in Denver found Alina's cancer early 
during a routine check-up.

Luckily, they were already monitoring her thyroid. Alina had been having problems with her thyroid since 2008, when she went to see her doctor who found that her levels were off.

Specialists advised her to put off having surgery to remove the gland until after 
her pregnancy as thyroid cancer is generally slow growing. They feared that embarking on a course of treatment while pregnant could harm her unborn child.

Happy family: Alina Pugel with husband Jeff, daughter Sophia and baby William. Alina has a small scar on her neck from the surgery and will have to take regular medication but says life couldn't be better

Eight
weeks after baby William was born, Alina had a thyroidectomy. The 
surgery was successful and because the cancer had not spread to any lymph nodes, 
no further treatment was needed.

Now
Alina's baby boy William is healthy, she's gone through with the 
surgery that's left nothing more than a small scar on her neck.

According to the Center for Disease 
Control, thyroid cancer is the fastest growing cancer in the world and 80
per cent of those affected are women.

In the last decade there has been a 7 per cent increase in the number of cases in the United States.

Dr Kimberly Vanderveen, an endocrine 
surgeon at the hospital where Alina had surgery, urged people to 
have regular check-ups.

She
says thyroid cancer does not have any real symptoms. 'It’s a cancer 
where early detection really affects the outcome, so we really want 
people to know it’s out there and be proactive about getting checked,' Dr Vanderveen said.
