Michelle Obama is hoping to build diplomatic bridges during her visit to China this week, by bringing her mother along on the trip.

When the First Lady arrives in Beijing tomorrow she will be accompanied by daughters Sasha and Malia as well as their grandmother Marian Robinson.

Mrs Obama is said to be steering clear of politics during her week-long trip, focusing on education and community.

After arriving in Beijing tomorrow, 
Mrs Obama will visit several schools and universities as well as hosting
 a roundtable on education and promoting exchange programmes.

By her side will be her two daughters, but also her 76-year-old mother Marian Robinson.

Mrs
 Robinson, the first live-in grandmother in the White House since the 
1950s, is the only living grandparent of Malia, 15, and Sasha 12.

She
 is a constant presence in Malia and Sasha’s daily lives, helping them 
with homework, taking them to and from school and caring for them when 
their parents are out of town.

White
 House officials hope that by accompanying her daughter and 
granddaughters, she will ‘resonate with the Chinese people,’ as it is common 
for grandparents help bring up children in the Asian powerhouse nation.

Philanthropic work: Peng has served as WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS since 2011

Xi Jinping (centre) and Peng Liyuan arrive in Kuala Lumpur in October last year. Peng's presence is unusual insomuch as wives of Chinese leaders are rarely seen

In China, and a majority of South-East Asian countries, families keep multi-generational households and grandparents are seen as secondary care providers.

‘I think they understand the significance as well of family and of three generations of family traveling together, which I think the Chinese will appreciate, and will appreciate the ties and the bonds that the Obama family have with one another across generations,’ the first lady's chief of staff Tina Tchen said.

‘This is a great opportunity for the Obama family to experience that, and I think for the Chinese to see that as well in an American family.’

The first lady is expected to steer clear of more contentious U.S. - China issues such as human rights, trade and counterfeiting during her week-long visit.

Ms Tchen said that stressing the shared importance of education to young people in the U.S. and China was important not just for students but ‘vital for the competitiveness of our U.S. global economy.’

Ben Rhodes, the White House deputy national security adviser, added that even without directly addressing difficult matters, the first lady's visit brings with it ‘the power of her own story and the power of American values, which I think is completely interwoven with our commitment to human rights.’

THURSDAY: Michelle, Sasha and Malia Obama and Marian Robinson arrive in Beijing.

FRIDAY: Joins China's first lady Peng Liyuan at Beijing Normal School; visits Forbidden City; meets with Peng and joins her for dinner and performance.

SATURDAY: Addresses students at Stanford Center at Peking University; participates in virtual discussion with American youth; visits Summer Palace; meets with staff and families of U.S. Embassy.

WEDNESDAY, March 25: Visits Chengdu Panda Base; has lunch at a Tibetan restaurant.

Where the Obama administration has differences with China, Rhodes added, the U.S. addresses those in direct contacts with the Chinese government. ‘We don't think the first lady should make this a focus at all of her trip,’ he said in a conference call previewing the first lady's trip.

After arriving in Beijing on Thursday, Mrs Obama will spend Friday with Peng Liyuan, the wife of President Xi Jinping, who will take the three generations of Obama to visit a school in the capital.

She is scheduled to address American and Chinese students at Peking University on Saturday about the importance of study abroad and other cultural exchanges as well as the stakes the two countries have in one another's success.

The three generations of Obama will also be travelling to several cultural landmarks in and around Beijing, including the Forbidden City, the Great Wall and the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum.
