Bosnian Serbs have unveiled a statue in Sarajevo of their compatriot who triggered the First World War by assassinating the Austro-Hungarian crown prince there 100 years ago today.

Members of the Orthodox Christian community in the mostly Muslim city held a ceremony in their quarter to celebrate 'hero' Gavrilo Pricip’s shooting of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

A young actor dressed as the assassin, who had hoped to free Bosnia from Habsburg control and join the Kingdom of Serbia, ran on to the stage and fired two shots in the air.

These are the actual guns used by the assassins used to kill Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914 on display at the Museum of Military History in Vienna, Austria

People in the crowd shouted that he 
should shoot Nato or the EU, both of which are blamed for preventing the
 Bosnian Serbs winning their country’s brutal civil war between 1992 and
 1995.

Milorad Dodik, the president of Serbian half of Bosnia-Herzegovina, then unveiled the two-metre-high bronze statue yesterday.

'Gavrilo Princip was a freedom fighter and the Austro Hungarian empire was an occupier here,' he said.

'People who live here have never been on the same side of history and are still divided.

'We are sending different messages and
 that says it all about this country which is being held together by 
international violence.'

Bosnian people gathered to touch or kiss the statue of Gavrilo Princip, who they consider a freedom fighter

In the Bosnian Serb East Sarajevo they
 have a different view of Bosnia's future: to divide the country so that
 the Serb part can join neighbouring Serbia.

Underlining this division, at the 
other end of Sarejevo, which is controlled by the Muslim and Croat 
federation, the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra will play an EU-sponsored 
performance.

It is planned as both salute to 
European integration and a symbolic start of a new century of peace 
where the emperor’s heir was killed on June 28, 1914.

The assassination, which symbolically 
took place on the Serbian Orthodox Church’s St Vitus Day, led the Austro
 Hungarian empire to declare war on neighbouring Serbia.

And, thanks to a series of alliances, 
Europe’s major powers were all dragged into fighting an unimaginably 
bloody conflict that led to the slaughter of 16million people.

Yet what was really behind the war 
were the dark aspirations of Germany – which despite its greater 
military and industrial might – was an imperial minnow.

Germany, which erroneously believed 
Britain would remain neutral if it invaded France, essentially wanted to
 shift the balance of power in its favour.

Its military chiefs planned for a 
swift and crushing blow against France in which its army would reach 
Paris before the French or British had fully mobilized their troops.

But the conflict - characterised by 
the stalemate of trench war and of lions led by donkeys as they were 
machine-gunned down for a few inches of land – would last until 1918.

The war, which pitted also pitted 
Russia, Italy and ultimately the United States against Germany, 
Austro-Hungary and Turkey, changed the face of the continent.

Ultimately, the British and French were victorious, but the German army was never defeated militarily.

Rather, their countrymen were being 
starved to death at home and the entrance of the U.S. in 1917 made the 
Allies look unbeatable.

This sense of a cheated military 
outcome – combined with harsh reparations ordered by France – is argued 
by many historians to have been a cause of World War Two.

Mounting Russian casualties during WWI
 also led to a Communist dictatorship that led to the deaths of millions
 in purges and careless tactics in the following war.

Yet all these tragic events might have
 been avoided if Franz Ferdinand’s chauffeur hadn’t driven the wrong way
 back on June 28, 1914.

Driver Leopold Loyka made a wrong turn
 past Sarajevo’s Schiller’s deli, where forlorn gunman Gavrilo Princip 
was dining after his earlier assassination plan failed.

The Serb leapt out of the café and 
seized his chance – and wwo bullets later, both Franz Ferdinand and 
Princess Sophie, who was shot as she tried to cover her husband, lay 
dead.

Franz Ferdinand was sitting in the back of this car with his wife Sophie when they were shot dead by assassins in Sarajevo one hundred years ago

The car's bodywork was pierced by incoming rounds as the Archduke and his wife lay mortally wounded

Where the tide of history turned: Tourists gathered on Friday around a replica of the Graf & Stift car that Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sofia were riding in when they were assasinated by Princip - and at the spot where it happened, in front of the museum in downtown Sarajevo
