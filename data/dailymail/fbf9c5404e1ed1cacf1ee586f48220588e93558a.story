Two distinguished authors — arguably the most celebrated in their fields — will take centre-stage at our autumn literary lunch.

Dickie Arbiter served as press secretary to Queen Elizabeth, and media manager for Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana.

He is the only royal commentator to have been present at the Queen’s Coronation and her Silver, Golden and Diamond Jubilees.

In addition to his duties as a royal spokesman, he media-managed all of the Queen’s major ceremonial engagements, as well as the arrangements for royal funerals, including that of Diana, Princess of Wales.

He is considered one of the most knowledgeable commentators on the British monarchy, and broadcasts extensively on royal matters, both in Britain and abroad.

His new book, On Duty With The Queen, is his frank account of life with the Royals, told with wit and insight by a seasoned raconteur.

We are proud to mark the centenary of the outbreak of World War I with eminent historian and Daily Mail journalist Sir Max Hastings. The prize-winning and best-selling author of numerous books on both World Wars, his latest, Catastrophe: Europe Goes To War 1914, is a passionate defence of why this was a conflict in which Britain had to fight, and a brilliant description of the early theatre of war from Ypres to Serbia, Prussia and Galicia.

In the chair once more is Gyles Brandreth, our genial master of ceremonies, whose books include diaries, biographies, the popular Oscar Wilde detective series (‘very entertaining’ with ‘rattlingly elegant dialogue’) and his inspirational The 7 Secrets Of Happiness, now also a one-man show.

HOW TO BOOK: Our lunch is held at the four-star Lancaster London Hotel, West London, overlooking Hyde Park, on Friday, September 26, from noon.

There will be a three-course lunch with wine, preceded by a reception with cash bar at which guests can meet the authors. There will also be book signings after lunch.

Tickets cost £75 per person. Please send cheques, payable to the Lancaster London Hotel, with the name(s) of your guest(s), if any, for the table plan to: Caroline Hamilton Fleming, 27 Baalbec Road, London, N5 1QN.
