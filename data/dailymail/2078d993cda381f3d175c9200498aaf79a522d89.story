British bank Standard Chartered Plc will reportedly be fined $327million (£203m) following allegations that it violated U.S. sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Libya and Burma.

The U.S. Federal Reserve today said the bank will pay $100m (£62m) for providing 'incomplete responses' to examiners and having an inadequate sanctions compliance programme.

This comes on top of the $227m (£141m) it is to forfeit in deferred prosecution agreements with the U.S. Justice Department and the New York District Attorney.

'Inadequate': Standard Chartered was accused of behaving like a 'rogue institution' in its New York transactions

Between 2001 and 2007, the London-listed bank carried out thousands of U.S. dollar transactions for parties affiliated with Iran, 
Sudan, Libya and Burma, according to the U.S. Justice Department.

In an explosive legal order, New York regulator Benjamin Lawsky claimed it 'operated as a rogue institution'.

The U.S. suspects that Iran was using 
its banks to finance 'terrorist groups' such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the
Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

Findings include a memo sent in 
October 2006 from the bank's U.S. chief executive to the group executive 
director in London, raising concerns about the activities with Iran.

The director allegedly replied: 'You 
****ing Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that 
we're not going to deal with Iranians?'

The U.S. Treasury Department also entered into a settlement to resolve allegations that the bank's London and Dubai offices violated U.S. sanctions against the four countries.

The Treasury said it levied a $132m (£82m) penalty, but deemed that satisfied by the bank's payment to the Department of Justice.

Recovery: Standard shares have recovered much of the ground lost in August, when it was hit by lurid claims it had exposed the U.S. to terrorists and drug kingpins by carrying out £160bn of secret transactions with Tehran

The federal-state settlements come several months after Standard agreed to pay $340m (£211m) to resolve a related case brought by the New York banking regulator.

The bank, whose main operations are in Asia, was hit by lurid claims from the regulator that it had exposed the U.S. to terrorists and drug kingpins by carrying out £160bn of secret transactions with Tehran.

Standard, which employs nearly 90,000 people worldwide and sponsors Liverpool Football Club, was initially threatened with losing its licence to operate within New York state when the scandal broke last summer.

The 160-year-old lender said today that the New York settlement would push its pre-tax profit growth down to a 'mid-single digit rate' rather than in the double-digit range.

Yet shares were up 1 per cent or 11.25p at 1,499.75p last week, with analysts saying that the news of how much the final payout was likely to be had removed some uncertainty around the impact of the scandal.

The penalty is likely to be 'less costly than for some of its rivals', according to Richard Hunter from Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers.
