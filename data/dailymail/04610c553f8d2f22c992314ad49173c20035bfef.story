Luis Suarez paid tribute to England goalkeeper Joe Hart after the keeper’s last minute penalty save helped keep Manchester City in the Champions League.

Speaking to Sport 890 radio in Uruguay the Barcelona striker, who has now scored four times against the goalkeeper in their last two meetings, said: ‘Hart is a great professional. He congratulated me just as he had done at the World Cup. And to do that in the circumstances shows the type of person he is.’

With the score left at 2-0 after Hart saved Lionel Messi’s spot-kick, City still have a chance of progressing and the Barcelona foward added: ‘It was important to get a good first leg lead especially against a team as strong as City but we know that the tie is not settled yet.

'Scoring goals when you are the away team is not easy but they are a very good side so we know it is not over. We knew how tough it would be when the draw was made. Only Chelsea with PSG had as a difficult a draw.’

It was Suarez's first brace since joining Barcelona from Liverpool in the summer for £75m. He admitted to starting to feel the pressure of not having scored many goals in his first season but said his relationship on and off the field with Messi and Neymar had helped him come through it.

Suarez said: ‘I’m aware of the team that I have joined and the amount of money that was paid for me and I knew everyone would be watching to see if I was going to justify that but I am also very conscious of the quality of the players that I have around me.

‘I am performing a function that helps them. I drag defenders out of position and that leaves space for Leo and Neymar and I play passes to them. And we know that when they get one on one with defenders – in situations like that they are unstoppable.

Suarez now has nine goals in 23 games for Barcelona. He said: ‘I have been used to teams pushing up and leaving space in behind but when you play for Barcelona most teams sit deep and don’t leave any space behind.

‘In the beginning I wasn’t worried at all because I knew the goals would come. But there was a time about a month ago at the start of the year when it started to play on my mind.

‘I am hard on myself when I feel I’m letting the team down and there was a time when I was missing good chances. But I have been around long enough to know that you play through these moments in your career.

‘Neymar is a joker and I get on well with him. And the relationship is very good with Leo and Masherano. No one in the squad feels superior to anyone else. I was surprised when I joined by how down to earth the players are.’
