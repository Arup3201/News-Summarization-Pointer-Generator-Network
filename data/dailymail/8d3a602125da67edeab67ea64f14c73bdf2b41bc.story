A firefighter has died from cancer just months after celebrating the birth of twin sons. 

Rob Wright, 39, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia just three weeks before he was due to marry his wife Samantha in April.

The father-of-five was put straight onto an aggressive course of chemotherapy and despite his weakened condition he celebrated his wedding in a small ceremony surrounded by close family and friends.

Rob Wright and his wife Samantha were overjoyed by the birth of their twin sons Zack and Owen on July 24. Mr Wright had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia just four months before

Mr Wright, from Wallsend in North Tyneside, had first fallen ill on March 22. Doctors told him he had glandular fever and did some blood tests. 

But just a few days later he was in the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle having chemotherapy.

'Even when he was first diagnosed with leukaemia, all he was bothered about was getting married and asking if he would be able to go, recalled his widow Samantha, 26.

Mr Wright, a firefighter, underwent four rounds of chemotherapy and both doctors and his family had been hopeful he would make a full recovery

'He just wanted to get on with it, he just took whatever they threw at him. His phrase was "let's just get on with it". He was very brave throughout it all.

'He was really poorly and we had to cancel the evening do for the wedding.'

During treatment Mr Wright underwent four rounds of chemotherapy. Both doctors and his family were hopeful he would make a full recovery.

Thinking their luck was turning around, the couple were overjoyed by the birth of their twin sons Zack and Owen on July 24, just as Mr Wright's recovery seemed to be on course.

But a routine MRI scan in October dealt the young family a devastating blow - the cancer had spread to his nervous system. 

Mrs Wright said: 'All the way through
 from the first lot of chemotherapy, all the signs were good. They 
thought it would be a standard transplant,so it was a massive shock for everybody.'

Mr Wright and his wife Samantha had been set to marry this April and the wedding went ahead, despite his diagnosis. Right: with his son Dominic

Doctors
 tried giving him radiotherapy but it did nothing to help and on October
 26 he returned home to spend his last days with his family, passing 
away on October 29.

Mrs Wright added her late husband 'loved nothing more than a challenge', including taking part in 'tough guy' competitions in Wolverhampton, pushing himself to the limit jumping through rings of fire and swimming in frozen lakes.

She said: 'If you took all the words from the thesaurus for amazing it still wouldn't be enough to describe Rob. I will miss everything about him.

'He was very popular and full of fun, always laughing, cracking his jokes and very reliable. He would just do anything to help anybody.'

Mr Wright has three children from his previous marriage, step-daughters Jordan, 20,  and Dayle, 17, and 12-year-old son Dominic.

His family are asking for support for the Anthony Nolan Trust, to raise awareness of bone marrow donation.
