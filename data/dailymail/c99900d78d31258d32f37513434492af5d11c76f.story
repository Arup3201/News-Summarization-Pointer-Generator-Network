This stylish granny was spotted driving through the streets on her modified mobility scooter.

Teenager David Richards took a photo of the elderly driver as she waited at a zebra crossing in Orpington, south east London yesterday.

The woman, who was wearing a purple head scarf and cream coat, appeared to have given her scooter a makeover - complete with eye-catching bright white bodywork.

David, a pupil at St Olave's Grammar School, said there was a queue of traffic behind the scooter - which was travelling at roughly 20mph.

The 17-year-old added that the striking vehicle was making a loud noise.

He said: 'I took a picture and sent it to a friend and at first he didn't believe me, but it's completely genuine.

'It was around 3.20pm and I was walking past when I saw her, the scooter was making quite a loud noise like the engine was labouring maybe.

'It was going about 20mph and there was quite a queue of traffic behind her, I've never seen anything like this before.'

'It looked like a side car, but one that acted as a motorcycle. I don't think she had license plates, but the bike looked a bit customised.'
