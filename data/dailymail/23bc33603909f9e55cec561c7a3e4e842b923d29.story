Louis van Gaal has called for Manchester United to improve, despite beating arch rivals Liverpool to record their sixth consecutive Premier League victory on Sunday.

Goals from Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie produced a clinical performance at Old Trafford without setting the pulses racing as United moved up to third place in the table - eight points behind leaders Chelsea.

Although Van Gaal insists his side were deserved winners, the Dutchman still sees room for improvement, especially in terms of ball possession.

'I think we have scored wonderful goals. We kept the shape really good but in spite of the goals we gave a lot of chances away. We have to improve,' he said.

'It was so easy playing in the second half because we had so much space but nevertheless we gave the ball away. I have to ask the players why.

Despite United's expensive of array of forwards combining to score the goals, keeper David de Gea was once again the former champion's standout performance with a series of world class saves to deny

'You can always say some players are the most influential and of course De Gea did very well. But I can mention other players who had a big influence on the game today,' said Van Gaal.

The Dutchman also suggested that his side were fortunate to defeat Southampton in their previous game where they edged a 2-1 victory at St Mary's.

'Today I think we were the better team and we deserved to win so it was not the same as in Southampton. 

'We pressed more in front today which is always the key. It is a matter of a process and it is very important that we win because then they believe in the philosophy,' he added.
