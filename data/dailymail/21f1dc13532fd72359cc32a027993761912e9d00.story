West Ham United vs Swansea City (Upton Park)

Team news

West Ham

Sam Allardyce is hoping to have a trio of players fit and ready to feature in West Ham's Premier League clash with Swansea on Sunday.

The game may yet come too early for midfielder Mark Noble (calf) but Allardyce believes both Diafra Sakho (back) and Alex Song (knee) could play some part against the Swans.

Alex Song (left) has missed West Ham's last three games as he battles Manchester City's Jesus Navas earlier in the campaign during the Hammers 2-1 victory over the champions

With Enner Valencia making his own comeback from injury in the midweek victory at West Brom and Andy Carroll fit, Allardyce will now have all of his attacking options available as he looks to guide the Hammers to an eighth league win of the campaign.

Provisional squad: Adrian, Jaaskelainen, Cresswell, O'Brien, Reid, Tomkins, Collins, Jenkinson, Noble, Kouyate, Song, Nolan, Amalfitano, Downing, Jarvis, Vaz Te, Cole, Zarate, Sakho, Valencia.

Swansea

Neil Taylor misses Swansea's Barclays Premier League trip to West Ham on Sunday after picking up his fifth booking of the season against QPR in midweek.

Defender Taylor has been ever-present in the league this season and, with no natural cover at left-back, Dwight Tiendalli or Jazz Richards are likely to deputise with Angel Rangel restored on the right after being rested from the Rangers victory.

Neil Taylor (centre) appeals to a referee during Swansea's clash at Manchester City last month but is now ruled out of the meeting at West Ham having collected five yellow cards

Swansea manager Garry Monk will assess how Leon Britton came through his first start of the season after three months out with knee trouble before finalising his side at Upton Park, but Argentina defender Federico Fernandez is still not fit enough to make the matchday squad despite returning to training this week after a calf problem.

Provisional squad: Fabianski, Rangel, Bartley, Williams, Richards, Britton, Ki, Montero, Routledge, Sigurdsson, Bony, Tremmel, Amat, Richards, Shelvey, Carroll, Dyer, Gomis, Emnes, Barrow, Tiendalli, Fulton.

Kick-off: Sunday 1.30pm - Sky Sports 1

Odds (subject to change):

West Ham 13/10 

Draw 23/10

Swansea 11/5 

Referee: Chris Foy 

Managers: Sam Allardyce (West Ham), Garry Monk (Swansea)

Head-to-head league record: West Ham wins 21, draws 10, Swansea wins 15
