When a relative of an Illinois couple approached them offering to launch a fundraiser to help with their gravely ill son's medical expenses, the young parents were overjoyed and filled with gratitude.

But then late last month the GoFundMe page benefiting 5-month-old Noah Knickerbocker suddenly vanished, along with the collected money, leaving the boy's parents, Rachel and Tyler Knickerbocker, baffled and saddened.

Noah was born in August 2014 suffering from a congenital heart defect. At two and a half weeks, the newborn had a heart surgery and is currently on a waiting list for a transplant.

Family in crisis: When a relative of Tyler and Rachel Knickerbocker approached them offering to start an online fundraiser to help with their newborn son Noah's medical expenses, they were overjoyed, but they soon discovered he had another plan in mind

Speaking to ABC News this week, Rachel Knickerbocker said when she went on Facebook last month, she saw that the relative who had started the crowdfunding campaign for her son, Ken Wills, posted snapshots of three checks totaling $6,500 he supposedly donated to organizations that have been helping Noah without consulting them.

It didn't take Mrs Knickerbocker long to figure out where Wills, her husband’s godfather, found the money to make such generous contributions.

The husband and wife, who also have a 3-year-old, had been planning to use the money raised through the GoFundMe page to rent an apartment near their son's hospital.

The Knickerbockers quit their jobs in Illinois and moved from their home in Huntley into the Ronald McDonald House across the street from the Wisconsin Children’s Hospital five months ago so they could be closer to their ailing son at all times.

According to Rachel Knickerbocker, she and Tyler discovered that something was wrong with their unborn son 22 weeks into her pregnancy.

Ailing: Noah Jordan Knickerbocker was born in August with a congenital heart defect rendering the left side of his heart essentially useless   

Champion: Ken Wills, Tyler Knickerbocker's godfather, had emerged as a champion for baby Noah, taking to social media to raise awareness of the baby's condition and ask for donations 

After meeting with a fetal cardiologist, the young parents learned that their child was gravely ill, suffering from critical aortic stenosis: a condition that prevents blood flow from the heart into the aorta, leaving the left side of the heart underdeveloped and unable to pump blood into the body.

While Noah was still in the womb, doctors at Boston Children’s Hospital performed a procedure called balloon dilation to open his aortic valve in utero.

As 12 hours old, Noah had his second balloon dilation, and three days after the boy was welcomed into the world he was placed on a waiting list for a new heart at 1A status - most urgent - where he has remained for the past five months.

After learning of Ken Wills' decision to donate the money raised for Noah to charity, the boy's parents appealed to him asking to reconsider, and according to Mrs Knickerbocker, Wills promised his godsend to send the money to them, but it never arrived.  

Ken Wills had been actively spreading the word about the Knickerbockers' predicament for months, even though the parents say he's never met little Noah in person.

Noah's parents quit their jobs and moved into the Ronald McDonald House across the street from the hospital so they could be close to him 

The relative has been busy tweeting Noah's hospital photos, sending messages to celebrities asking them to retweet #HelpNoah and appealing for financial help for the newborn's family.

On the now defunct GoFundMe page and on his Facebook account, Wills repeatedly stated that he would be auctioning off autographs of famous people he had collected over the years, including Keanu Reeves, Matthew McConaughey, Walter Cronkite and Lauren Bacall, to raise money for his godson's child.

Among the people who took interest in Noah's story were Jenna Dewan, the wife of Channing Tatum, and actor Jamie Dornan, the star of the upcoming film adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey.

After shutting down the GoFundMe page, Wills shared on his Facebook page images of checks made out to three organizations: $2,500 to the Ronald McDonald House; $2,500 to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin and $1,000 to Boston Children’s Hospital.

Good news: After spending five months on the waiting list, Noah underwent a successful transplant surgery and is now recovering

According to the Knickerbockers, Ken Wills went so far as to send them a fake thank-you note from the Ronald McDonald House for the donation.

On December 30, Ken Wills posted a lengthy status update on his Facebook page indirectly addressing the Knickerbockers’ allegations.

‘Some people are upset that I donated the auction proceeds to the Ronald McDonald House charity and also to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin two wonderful charities that have been helping Noah and his family since birth,’ he wrote. ‘Noah's parents are under a great deal of stress, which is understandable.’

The family have another GoFundMe page set up by Noah's mother, which has collected just under $6,300 since October.

On Monday, the Knickerbockers finally got some good news: a heart has been found for their baby. Noah underwent a successful transplant surgery and is now recovering.

‘We just got to see Noah and give him kisses while he was on the way to his room!’ his overjoyed parents wrote Monday afternoon on a Facebook page dedicated to Noah. ‘It will still be a few hours before we can be with him...patiently waiting!’
