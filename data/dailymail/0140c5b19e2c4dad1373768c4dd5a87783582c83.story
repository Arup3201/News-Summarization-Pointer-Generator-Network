The chief of UN observers in Syria has said their mission is being suspended because of escalating violence in the country.

Major General Robert Mood said that the continued bloodshed is posing significant risks to the observers during patrols and is impeding their ability to carry out their mandate.

The announcement comes as opposition activists claimed 12 people were killed in the Syrian capital Damascus after shelling by government troops.

Most of the deaths occurred overnight in the suburb of Douma, where regime forces were said to have fired mortars that struck a residential building, killing eight people.

Douma-based activist Mohammed Saeed and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a further four people were killed in the shelling of Arbeen and Tall suburbs.

'The regime is trying to purge the suburbs of the capital of all resistance,' Mr Saeed said.

He said the fire on the suburbs was indiscriminate and that a man, his wife and their child died when a mortar shell hit their apartment in Arbeen.

Mr Saeed said UN observers deployed in Syria to monitor the cease-fire, which never really took hold, have not been to Douma in over a week.

'But anyway, all they can do is record what they see, they cannot help,' he said.

There are nearly 300 UN monitors currently in Syria. After today's announcement by Major General Mood they will stop conducting patrols and stay in their locations 'until further notice'.

The move to stop patrols is the latest sign that a peace plan brokered by international envoy and former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is disintegrating.

Major General Mood had said yesterday that an increase in bloodshed is derailing the mission.

'Violence over the past 10 days has been intensifying willingly by the both parties, with losses on both sides and significant risks to our observers,' he told reporters in Damascus.

He also said there was a concern among the states that provide the observers that the risk is approaching an unacceptable level - suggesting the violence could prompt the observers to pull out of the country at some point.

Western powers have pinned their hopes on the Annan plan, in part because there are no other options on the table.

There is little support for military intervention, and several rounds of sanctions have failed to stop the bloodshed.

Activists claim some 14,000 people have been killed since the uprising against president Bashar Assad began in March 2011.

The uprising began as a largely peaceful protest movement but has since escalated into an insurgency seeking to topple the regime.
