The principal of one of America’s top high schools has warned students over their tradition of picking prom dates based on an NFL-style draft system, saying that it may lead to girls being objectified.

Boys at Corona del Mar High School in Newport Beach have been picking dates for their proms using their version of the draft system for years.

It’s not endorsed by the school so they would often do it in secret.

Controversy: Boys at Corona del Mar High School in Newport Beach have been picking dates for their proms using their version of the draft system for years

But the school’s principal condemned the practice in a letter to parents and students after it was increasingly conducted in public, with the help of social media sites.

Some students posted messages on Twitter urging girls to look their best in the weeks leading up to the prom.

One wrote ‘many drafters on the prowl tomorrow for #freeagents so dress nice ladies’, according to the Orange County Register.

The NFL 
draft system is designed to level the playing field in American 
Football, with teams at the bottom of the league able to cherry-pick the
 best college students for the following season.

The boys at Corona del Mar High would mimic this system by picking numbers from a bowl, with lower numbers enabling them to approach girls deemed the most desirable.

But money is involved, too.

It was reported that some students were paying over $100 in order to select their ideal prom dates, with some attending proms with girls they barely knew.

Last week Principal Kathy Scott said in a letter to parents and students: ‘I am sure that the intention of this "draft" is not to be harmful, but it may be.

'It is not OK for any student to be objectified or judged in any way.'

A feminist organization at neighboring Estancia High School slammed the prom draft as 'insulting'.

However, the system has many fans, including girls.

Sophomore Jessie Harris told the Register that 'it is all just a fun way to decide who you will be going to prom with'.

She added: 'It is not meant to harm those who are picked and I do not believe that it does.'

Corona del Mar High School was ranked 127 out of 21,786 high schools by U.S. News and World Report for maths and science.
