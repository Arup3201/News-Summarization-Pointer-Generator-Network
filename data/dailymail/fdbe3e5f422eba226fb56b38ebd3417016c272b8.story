Gossip singer Beth Ditto has been arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.

The 32-year-old rocker was taken into custody in the early hours of Saturday morning after a disturbance outside the Bungalo Bar in Portland, Oregon.

Beth - real name Mary Beth Patterson - was detained by officers for being drunk after she left the establishment and allegedly threw her shoes in the middle of the road.

The singer then reportedly started shouting out the name of US President Barack Obama as her friends tried to put her in a car.

A source at the bar told the Willamette Week newspaper: 'She walked out in the middle of the street, threw off her shoes and purse and screamed Obama, Obama!'

Beth has been accused by a fellow reveller of being "blackout" drunk and trying to start fights in the bar, after initially being refused entry for being so intoxicated.

She has also been accused of kicking a bar tender in the groin during her raucous night out.

The Standing In The Way of Control singer was later released from custody and is now awaiting a court date.

If she is convicted of second degree disorderly conduct she could be sentenced to up to six months in jail and may receive a fine of up to $2,500.

Ditto has kept herself out of the public eye as much over recent times but has started to concentrate on hew new music releases.

The flamboyant star released a new Gossip music video for track Get A Job last month.

The Arkansas-native showcases her 
figure in a black leotard as she is transformed in to a 'sexy chat girl' in 
the new promo.

The new video from the American 
rockers sees Beth and her bandmates try a succession of jobs they could 
have had if they hadn't found fame... and ones they did have before signing their first record deal.

In the colourful promo, Beth becomes a dentist, a secretary, a car saleswoman, a mausseuse, builder and a pet groomer.

In one sequence, the singer even dons a tight pale blue dress and apron to work in a greasy burger joint.

Get A Job is the new single from Gossip's fifth studio album A Joyful Noise.

Explaining the song and video premise, Beth said: 'Get
A Job is about all the rich kids we knew when we were younger, kids who
never had jobs but always had money for partying or getting their hair 
done.

Charged: She has since been released after being taken in for her raucous night out at Portland's Bungalo Bar

'We would come home from our fast food jobs in greasy clothes and 
they would have spent all their parents’ money on handbags and vodka.

'These
are some of the jobs we’ve had in the past, some we’ll probably have 
again in the future. Much love and respect to those who work and those 
who WORK IT!!!!!'
