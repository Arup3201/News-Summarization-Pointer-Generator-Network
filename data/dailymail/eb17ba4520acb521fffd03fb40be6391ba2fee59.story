It all started with the side boob - the subtle glimpse of bare breast revealed either by design or by accident - which quickly escalated into the extreme cleavage trend led by Miranda Kerr and Kim Kardashian.

But next season's cleavage style is much, much more daring, if Berlin Fashion Week is anything to go by.

The audience at the Kauffeld und Jahn couture show were given quite the eyeful as models took to the catwalk wearing delicate bridal gowns with their full frontal breasts shining through.Â 

Classy? Model Micaela Schaefer gives the audience an eyeful as she presents a creation at the Kauffeld und Jahn Couture show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Berlin, Germany

Dare to bare: The models strutted the catwalk in the couture gowns - but left little to the imagination

Designers Niklas Kauffeld and Matthias Jahn presented their risque offering at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Berlin, Germany.

The presentations of the autumn/winter 2014/15 collections take place from 14 to 17 January 2014 and will see the likes of Lena Hoscheck, SoPopular, Filippa K and LaLa Berlin showcase their seasonal offerings.

Cameras at the ready! Micaela closes the risque show on the first day of Berlin Fashion Week

Brains behind the brand: Designers Niklas Kauffeld (L) and Matthias Jahn pose with model Micaela Schaefer after their show (spot the heels!)

Slightly better: Although this model didn't bare her breasts, her hem line was decidedly short

Bang! A model poses, replica gun in hand, for photographers during the Sky-High Underwear show over the pond in Japan

Masked: Models sported Venetian masks made from scraps of paper and even bright red blooms
