Confrontation: James Dyer faces a charge of disorderly conduct after the baseball game fight

The parents of a ten-year-old boy have been cited for disorderly conduct after a fight broke out at the end of a Little League baseball game.

James and Jammie Dyer, from Greeley, Colorado, are facing charges after Mr Dyer allegedly confronted the other team's coach after his son was told off for trying to distract players.

Footage of the brawl that followed, involving about 18 people, was filmed on a cell phone until Mrs Dyer allegedly knocked the phone to the ground and hit the woman who owned it, witnesses claimed. 

Jennifer Metzler, who was at the competitive playoff on Tuesday last week, claimed that parents were rolling on the ground and that one man 
was kicked in the groin as the parents began fighting.

'The boys were crying; all the boys were crying,' Ms Metzler told 9 News.

Although
other people were allegedly involved, only the Dyers have been charged,
because police said they believed the couple had instigated the fight and that the others were only trying to intervene.

'[They were] cited for assault, 
disorderly conduct and theft, because it was reported that the cell 
phone was taken away and that mom had punched several people,' Greeley 
Police Sergeant Susan West said.

The tension at the Greeley Evans Youth League game began when Mr Dyer approached the coach of the other team, who had allegedly told his son off during the game.

'All of a sudden this guy comes over very aggressively and puts his finger through the chain link fence, throwing m***** f***ing and throwing F-bombs left and right at the coach,' one parent, who did not want to be identified, told 7 News.

He added: 'The coach wasn't responding to him and that got him even more angry.'

The situation escalated when Mrs Dyer allegedly hit a woman and knocked the cell phone she was filming on to the ground. 

'Some punches were thrown. And there was a charge of theft because the woman, Jammie Dyer, took the cell phone away and then refused to give it back to her,' Sergeant Steve Black said.

However, the Dyers are fighting the charges and claimed they were the victims. Mr Dyer is facing a charge of disorderly conduct and his wife is facing charges of misdemeanor assault, disorderly conduct and theft.

Charged: Jammie and James Dyer have been blamed for starting the fight, which allegedly involved 18 adults

They told 7 News that  Mrs Dyer did take the cell phone, but they were the ones who were attacked, adding that somebody threw a sports drink bottle at Mrs Dyer's head.

'They were just trying to defend themselves,' Nicole Garza, a witness, said. 'The other team's parents circled around him and started kicking and punching him.'

The young boys who witnessed the fight are being offered counseling.

'It is embarrassing, and the thing that makes it the most embarrassing is it's about kids and sometimes parents forget that we do this for kids and not for the adults,' Rick Juarez, president of the Greeley Evans Youth League, said.
