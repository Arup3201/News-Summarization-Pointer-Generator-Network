Preparation: Esther McVey claims it is her mission to better prepare school leavers for the work place

Young people must not let their dreams stand in the way of 'getting their foot in the door' of their first job, the employment minister said today.

Esther McVey, who last week said the jobless should be prepared to take lowly jobs in coffee shops, insisted she was not telling people to lower their ambitions.

But she insisted that they had to 'work their way up' as figures showed thousands of young jobless people have come off benefits after enrolling on controversial government work experience schemes.

New government figures show more than 3,000 young people a month have been given an opportunity to get their foot on the career ladder through work experience since 2011.

From January 2011 to May 2013 a total of 112,990 people aged 18-24 started work experience through the Government scheme.

Around half of work experience participants were off benefits 21 weeks after starting a placement.

Last week Miss McVey, 46, vowed that tackling 
youth unemployment will be her ‘top priority’ but said that those 
looking for work have to be prepared to get a foot on the ladder before 
expanding their horizons.

Asked
 if they should be prepared to take ‘entry-level jobs’, she told the Mail: 
‘Absolutely. You could be working at Costa. But in a couple of years’ 
time you might say, “I’d like to manage the area” or might even want to 
run a hotel in Dubai.’

But today she insisted she was not telling people to ditch their dreams to take any job.

She told ITV's Daybreak: 'I’ve worked with kids for many, many years now, particularly inner city kids.

'I said "Hold on to your dream, reach high, have a dream but what you need to do is get your foot on the ladder and work your way up".

'I certainly did not say get say: "Get rid of your dreams". I said: "Hold onto those dreams just work your way through".'

However she face criticism for suggesting there were jobs available which people were reluctant to take.

Last year, more than 1,700 people applied
 for eight jobs at a new Costa Coffee shop in Nottingham, which paid 
between £6.10 and £10 an hour.

However, Miss McVey, a former TV presenter, said it was 'tough' in the jobs market but more roles are on offer. 'The latest employment stats only last Wednesday said this is a record number of people going to employment so this Government, what we came in to do was rebalance the economy, stabilise it, get growth and get jobs.

'There is a lot to be positive about but still much more work to do.'

Latest employment figures also show that 
an extra 280,000 people had a job in the last three months - the largest
 quarterly increase since records began in the 1970s.

Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'With more than 900,000 young people unemployed and 250,000 young people out of work for over a year its clear the Government is failing to get young people back to work.

'Even the government’s own advisers branded its flagship scheme for young people, the Youth Contract, a failure. In December the Government admitted that the last time long-term youth unemployment reached the levels we are seeing was under the last Tory government led by John Major.'
