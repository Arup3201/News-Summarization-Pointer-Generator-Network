A pet dog stunned her elderly owner by dragging an entire human leg home after a walk.

The dog called Liberty left the limb in the front yard of 93-year-old Bill Flowers's home in Thurston County, Washington.

It has prompted a major police investigation and yesterday a ribcage, pelvis and part of a skull was discovered by police dogs in the nearby Nisqually Reservation.

Bill Flowers, 93, said his dog Liberty dragged the leg into his front yard from the nearby Nisqually Reservation (pictured)

Deputies are now trying to determine whether the body was a man or a woman and what was used to dismember it.

A jawbone with teeth was also discovered at the Nisqually Tribe's old fish hatchery and police believe animals may have scattered the body.

Mr Flowers initially planned to bury the leg on Tuesday as he was scared to contact police in case he was arrested.

However, he was persuaded to report it four days later by his daughter Cheryl.

Mr Flowers said he examined the limb and said it was gray and cut from the body about four inches from the buttocks.

Police teams and volunteers have since been searching for more human remains and a pelvis, ribcage, part of a skull and jawbone with teeth have all been discovered

He told Komo News: 'I picked it up, and looked at the toes and nothing. None of the leg or foot was damaged - from the knee down it wasn't damaged at all.'

Thurston County Sheriff's Office acting lieutenant Ray Brady said volunteers and five dog teams are walking the roads and trails in the reservation to try and find more remains.

Deputies initially put a GPS collar on Liberty in the hope she would lead them to where she found the remains.

Mr Flowers's daughter said the family have been left shaken by the discovery.

Detectives are now trawling reports for missing people in the area.
