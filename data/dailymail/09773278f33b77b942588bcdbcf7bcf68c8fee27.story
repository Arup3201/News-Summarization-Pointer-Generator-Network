Accused: Christian Todd Slaton, 19, faces four felony charges of first-degree animal cruelty after allegedly 'dismembering' cats and leaving the remains on the University of Montevallo campus

A University of Montevallo student 'dismembered' a cat and 'hung it up for display' on a flag pole in the middle of campus, according to court documents in Alabama.

Christian Todd Slaton, 19, faces four felony charges of first-degree cruelty to animals - including one for leaving the carcass of another cat near the university president's campus residence.

Two others were discovered near the university's 'Becoming' sculpture, a work by professor Ted Metz, and in woodland near the off-campus apartments in Montevallo where Slaton lives.

Montevallo's director of university relations, Jamie Bessette, said the first cat was discovered on October 16, with the second and third turning up a few days later.

Slaton has been kicked out of the University and is banned from its campus. He is due to appear in Shelby County District Court on December 12.

Court documents said one of the cats was 'hung up for display' on the main quad's flag pole, right in the middle of campus.

Another was found near the residence of University president Dr John W Stewart.

Bessette confirmed that the animals 'did not die of natural causes'.

He added today that the University is 'proud that the police department and Chief Chadd Adams and his officers did a great job in keeping the campus safe and secure and tracking this down.

'We're relieved this is behind us and can certainly start looking forward.'

Bessette said it was a coincidence that the student was suspended on October 31 and didn't believe there was any link between the acts and Halloween.  

The University of Montevallo is Alabama's only liberal arts college and has around 200 academic staff and just under 3,000 students.
