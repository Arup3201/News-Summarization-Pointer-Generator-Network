The body of an unidentified Taliban fighter allegedly murdered by five Royal Marines in Afghanistan may never be found, it emerged last night.

A team of forensic scientists and military police – protected by 120 soldiers – has flown to Helmand to investigate the hugely sensitive murder claims.

But the remains have still to be discovered and, even if they are, they may never be positively identified because nobody knows who he was. 

Heat of battle: Fighting in Helmand has pushed the Royal Marines to the limit

Details of the extraordinary search in the warzone have emerged days after the five troops won a court battle to protect their anonymity during their forthcoming trial because of ‘an immediate and real risk’ to their lives from terrorists.

The Marines first appeared in court last month. They are accused of murdering a captured Afghan national on or about September 15 last year, and were charged after the discovery of video footage on one of the men’s computers, allegedly showing them discussing what to do with a gravely injured captive.

It is the prosecution case that the man – whose name does not appear on any charge sheet – was subsequently murdered. The case has prompted an enormous public backlash with a Facebook campaign attracting over 100,000 supporters and protest marches across Britain demanding the charges be dropped.

None of the accused can be identified after Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett this week extended an anonymity order.

One protester, former Marine James Grant, 34 – a veteran of two tours in Afghanistan – said the charges against the five were unjust. He said: ‘They were doing their job in incredibly difficult circumstances. Most of our politicians have not been out to Afghanistan and can never imagine what it is like to be at war.’

Unusually, the charges were brought even though a body has not been found. In a region littered with booby-trap bombs and still infested with insurgents, it is the investigators’ task to search for it.

Tribal elders have had to be asked for permission for the search to go ahead and, potentially, a body being exhumed.

There is also the question of how the remains might be positively identified. Although thousands of Afghan males have been biometrically recorded to allow quick identification by troops, the biometric information may not have survived decomposition.

In addition, it has now emerged that the five Marines had for several days been fighting the Taliban in a desperate life-or-death struggle, described by one comrade as ‘a daily survival lottery’.

The case has focused attention too on the rules of engagement and how Britain applies the law to its servicemen and women operating under the pressures of the battlefield.

The Marines were part of a Commando Battle Group in and around Nad-e Ali, a rural area of Helmand that was once the Taliban’s heartland – an area stained with the blood of dozens of UK servicemen.

In an area known as Death Valley, their remote checkpoint base had come under fierce attack at least eight times and patrols from it were regularly ambushed.

In the six months leading up to the alleged killing last September, more than 20 troops had died in the province, seven of them Marines.

The small band of commandos – between 20 and 30 men – felt isolated in their mud-walled checkpoint, and are said to have stockpiled captured Taliban guns and ammunition in case their own ran out.

Morale across the Marines was dealt a
further blow with the death of a popular comrade, James Wright, 23, on 
August 5 last year when a ten-man patrol was attacked by a force of 
around 80 Taliban in the Shpazh Gerebian region.

After
four hours the patrol managed to pull back to their base with the help 
of air support and mortar fire. As is routine after a patrol, Wright had
taken off his helmet ahead of an operational debrief. It was then that the Taliban attacked again. Wright, a father-to-be, was fatally wounded in the head by a grenade.

In
the following days and weeks there were more attacks in Helmand; one 
base came under sustained fire for ten successive days. In mid-September
the fanatics mounted another attack on an isolated base, leaving more 
than 20 Marines pinned down. It is the aftermath of this attack that is 
the focus of the investigations.

An
Apache helicopter was called in and was able to end the Taliban 
assault. Once the fighting subsided, a gunman was found with severe 
wounds and allegedly close to death.

The
video footage allegedly shows Marines discussing what to do with him. 
Several are said to have held a vote. The filming then stops.

Their
options were to treat his wounds and ensure his evacuation to Camp 
Bastion or take him to their Forward Operating Base for treatment.

Last
October the Marines returned home to a heroes’ welcome and, officials 
say, it is likely that whatever happened would have remained secret, had
it not been for the arrest of one of the men by civilian police 
investigating a completely unrelated matter.

As part of that inquiry they seized his laptop, found the footage from the compound, and alerted the military.

Investigators have questioned officers and fellow Marines while Afghan interpreters are being traced.

The
five Marines – known only as A, B, C, D and E – face a Court Martial 
and their initial appearance was behind closed doors in Bulford garrison
on the edge of Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
