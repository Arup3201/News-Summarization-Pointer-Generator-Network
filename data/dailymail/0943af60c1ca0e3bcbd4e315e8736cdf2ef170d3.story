A North Carolina police officer fatally shot an unarmed man seeking help after a car accident has been charged with voluntary manslaughter.

Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University(FAMU) football player Jonathan Ferrell, 24, crashed his car down an embankment about 2:30 a.m. and then knocked on the door of a nearby residence looking for help, officials said.

The homeowner opened the door thinking it was her husband. She closed the door and called 911 when she didn't recognize Mr Ferrell, according to reports.

The woman told police that Mr Ferrell was 'banging on the door viciously,' according to the Charlotte Observer.

Arriving officers found Mr Ferrell a short distance from the home, he matched a description given by the homeowner, police said in a statement.

Officers approached Mr Ferrell to investigate the original call.The marooned man was shot with a Taser as he ran toward the officers, the statement said.

When the Taser did not subdue Mr Ferrell, Officer Randall Kerrick drew his weapon and fired multiple shots at the unarmed former football player - he was soon pronounced dead at the scene, the statement continued.

Victim: Jonathan Ferrell, 24, may have been seeking help when he was shot by police

After discovering the wrecked vehicles, authorities determined that Ferrell was potentially seeking help from the homeowner when she called 911, according to WSOC.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe said during a Saturday news conference that the accident was serious and Ferrell would have been forced to climb out of the back window of the vehicle, WSOC reported. He apparently walked to the nearest house and banged on the door.

Officials do not think Ferrell made threats or tried to rob the woman, said Mr Monroe.

'I don't believe threats were made,' the chief noted.

Mr Kerrick, 27, has turned himself in to face the charges, according to reports.

Ferrell knocked on this door looking for help after being in a car crash, but the homeowner called 911

'He is pretty shook up,' Chief Monroe noted. 'He's devastated.'

Mr Kerrick has been with Charlotte-Mecklenburg police since April 2011.

Monroe said at a news conference that 
Kerrick was in custody. Police say he was charged with voluntary 
manslaughter after an investigation found that the shooting was 
excessive.

'The investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr. Ferrell was excessive,' police said, adding that 'Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter.'

Mr Ferrell has just recently moved to Charlotte after leaving FAMU, records showed. He played safety during the 2009 and 2010 season, according to interim athletic director Michael Smith.

'Our hearts and prayers go out to his family during their time of bereavement,' Mr Smith said.

It is not clear what caused the crash, officials said, a separate investigation into the accident is still ongoing.

Two other officers at the scene have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a probe into the shooting, according to the station.
