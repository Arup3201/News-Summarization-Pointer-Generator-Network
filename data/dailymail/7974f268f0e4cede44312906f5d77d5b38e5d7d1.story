He's back: Arnold Schwarzenegger has the best catchphrase in a film, movie lovers have said

Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger has the best movie catchphrase ever, film fans have said.

A quarter of those polled said the Austrian-born actor's line 'I'll be back' from the 1984 science-fiction classic was the best line.

The star, who served as Governor of California, beat James Bond into second place with 14 per cent of votes going to 007's famous introduction 'Bond, James Bond'.

Voters in the poll, commissioned by film and TV streaming service LOVEFiLM to mark the release of Anchorman 2, put the Mary Poppins tongue-twister 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' in third place with 10 per cent of the votes.

Other popular choices in the poll, which was based on interviews with 1,806 people, were the line 'Who you gonna call?' from Ghostbusters and super-sleuth Sherlock Holmes' 'Elementary, my dear Watson'.

There were also honourable mentions for Robert De Niro's line 'You talking to me?' from Taxi Driver and Robin Williams' 'Good Morning Vietnam'.

LOVEFiLM editor Helen Cowley said: 'There are catchphrases from films that are universally recognised and quoted time and time again.

'It's interesting to see how they've crossed over into mainstream conversation, and amazing that one line can instantly conjure up a character and a scene so vividly.

'We've rounded up a definitive list of the best 10, and all of them can be found on LOVEFiLM for film fans wanting to re-live those memorable movie moments.'

Top three: Mary Poppins' long catchphrase Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious came third

1 - 'I'll be back' (Terminator, 1985) - 25 per cent

2 - 'Bond. James Bond' (James Bond) - 14 per cent

3 - 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' (Mary Poppins, 1964) - 10 per cent

4- 'Who you gonna call?' (Ghostbusters, 1984) - 9 per cent
