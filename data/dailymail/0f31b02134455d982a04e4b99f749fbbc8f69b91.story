A young auditor from Texas sent her entire team an 'I quit' email full of hashtags that accused her coworkers of being fake.

In a long email sent on Monday last week, Glory told her PricewaterhouseCoopers colleagues auditing is 'for people who truly don't have any other options'.

The message, titled Farewell and QUEEN BEY ALL DAY! singled out individual employees for criticism and ended with a rant about how Beyonce trumps Britney Spears.

'I quit': Auditor Glory resigned from her job in a ranting email that quickly went viral

At first her resignation sounded regular, with Glory writing: 'After careful consideration I will be ending my employment with PwC,' according to Gawker.

But as the letter, and quantity of hashtags continued, the auditor criticized her colleagues for faking an interest in a job that involves 'filling out useless workpapers that won't really benefit anybody'.

'After asking dozens upon dozens of 
auditors what they think of their jobs and getting responses that 
include "I love my job!" or "I wouldn't trade it for the world," I 
realized just how fake auditors can be,' Glory wrote.

In the letter that she wrote from her bed, she went on to offer some pointers to her colleagues, including 'get a real career that has meaning', and calling for an end to coach and partner meetings that she described, in a series of hashtags as: '#thatishissoawkward #icantdeal #soforced
 #fakeconvosforfakeauditors #noidontwanttogazeintoyoureyesatatablefortwo
 #waytoointimateformytaste'.

A week after resigning, Glory said she 
had no regrets. In an interview with Noir CPA she said: 'I'm not going 
to sit here and worry about potential negative effects in my life.'

In her letter, the young professional who had a background in finance, including two internships, hit back at those who arrived early and stayed late when partners were in town, and treated them like royalty. 

'The reality is, THEY'RE NOT! They are average Joe's like you and I, only their pockets are a little bigger,' she said.

The email then became more personal, as Glory singled out colleagues for individual criticism, berating them for going on about how stressed they are, talking about their home lives and giving Glory 'the side eye'.

The first team member, whose name was redacted from copies of the email that quickly went viral, was singled out for 'constantly trying to throw me under the bus'.

'Everyday we suffer from hearing this ish
 as well as listening to your countless stories about your girlfriend,' Glory wrote.

'You're such a gossiper that sometimes I think you're more feminine then 
you appear. Who does that? You're a grown man, get your life!'

For good measure she threw in a handful of hashtags for the male employee, including: '#yourlifesucksandyouclearlyknowit' and  '#someoneneedstheirvagwaxed #ohwaityoudonthaveone'.]

Daily grind: The New York offices of PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The day-to-day reality of being an auditor at one of their offices sparked a spectacular resignation email from Glory

Another coworker was berated for 
giving her the 'side eye', with Glory writing to her: 'I think those 
eyeballs need some readjusting. Girl, stop!'

With the last colleague to come in for criticism, Glory wrote: 'Where do I start? You hate yourself and your job, let's be honest.'

She added: 'Your cat doesn't care about you so stop caring about it. Stories about your nasty cat are unbearable.'

The rant ended with a list of ten reasons why Beyonce is a better performer than Britney Spears, before signing off with: 'Beyonce wins and now that I'm I'm out of here, I win too!!! #doingtheharlemshakeasitype'.

Since writing the letter, Glory said she has had some positive responses from people thanking her for 'giving them a voice'.

But the email also attracted negative and, in some cases, racist responses as commentators accused Glory of being a 'diversity hire'.

'I was definitely very shocked by how many racist people there still are,' she said, adding that claims she had been a 'diversity hire' were absurd.

The accounting graduate doesn't believe the letter will affect future employment, and said: 'I sent the email and didn't look back.'
