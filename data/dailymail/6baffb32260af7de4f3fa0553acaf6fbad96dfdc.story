Italy prop Martin Castrogiovanni is set to miss Saturday's Six Nations match against Scotland at Murrayfield after being bitten on the nose by a friend's dog.

The Italian rugby federation announced that Castrogiovanni had suffered a 'slight domestic incident' and been left out of the provisional squad, though they did not give any further details.

Ansa report that the Argentine-born 33-year-old had been playing with the dog which turned on him and caused a wound requiring 14 stitches.
