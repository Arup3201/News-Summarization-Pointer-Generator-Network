Jonny May has issued a defiant response to the perception in New Zealand that England will be lambs to the slaughter by declaring: ‘We are not a rubbish team.’

Stuart Lancaster’s tourists have been installed as 16/1 underdogs by local bookmakers for Saturday’s first Test in Auckland, with an expectant public eager to toast a resounding All Blacks victory.

The statistics make for frightening reading. New Zealand are chasing a 15th successive victory, have won every match at Eden Park since 1994 and have lost just once since lifting the World Cup in 2011.

Defiant response: Jonny May insists New Zealand should give England respect ahead of the first Test

In contrast, England are hamstrung here by the absence of key players from Aviva Premiership finalists Northampton and Saracens, and an injury list that has accounted for four British and  Irish Lions.

It is against this backdrop that the tourists are being billed as victims in waiting, but May insists Saturday’s outcome is no foregone conclusion.

‘We have nothing to lose but at the same time we have great players in our team,’ said the Gloucester wing.

‘We are going forward as a team. We are not a rubbish team, we have good principles, we have good structures and everyone is buying into that. We are a tough outfit to play against for anyone, irrespective of the new players that have come in, because of the culture we have created as a team and the way we play. It is easy for players to jump into it.

‘We are underdogs for this game. People have written us off but that’s not an excuse. We put pressure on ourselves, we want a performance and we will go out there and give it everything.'

England experienced mixed  fortunes on Tuesday with the news influential All Black Kieran Read will miss the first Test due to concussion being offset by Billy Twelvetrees’ absence from training once again.

The loss of No 8 Read, the International Rugby Board’s player of the year, will be keenly felt while a doubt hangs over prolific All Black wing Julian Savea, who is struggling with a knee injury.

England have been gifted their team talk for Saturday’s first Test after blundering All Black Brodie Retallick failed to correctly name a member of Stuart Lancaster’s squad.

Asked if he knew any of the tourists, Retallick responded ‘a couple’. When pressed for a name, the second row said ‘Michael Lawes’.

Retallick was referring to Courtney Lawes, who is unavailable.

England will find the gaffe galling as Retallick was in the All Blacks side that lost 38-21 atTwickenham in 2012.

England’s plans have been disrupted yet again with Twelvetrees’ inability to take part in the final  session before Lancaster names his team tomorrow night. The 25-year-old from Gloucester, who has been sidelined since May 3 because of an ankle problem, is set to be replaced by Bath’s Kyle Eastmond.

Of some comfort to Lancaster is the good health of May, whose enthusiastic running in the RBS 6 Nations ensures he will continue on the left wing when England’s schedule resumes on Saturday. May is yet to cross the try-line in internationals but understands the reasons for that. 

‘During the 6 Nations I learnt Test rugby is a big mental jump - the pressure, accuracy and intensity are higher, but I thought I came out of it a better player,’ he said.

‘We weren’t great at Gloucester at the end of the season but I went away and worked on things and I feel more confident in myself.

‘In the 6 Nations I noticed a couple of times I could have backed myself a little bit more on the outside. That’s a confidence thing, being involved in that for the first time. I have gone back to club level and worked on that.

‘It was frustrating coming off the pitch thinking, “I could have gone for it then”. It wasn’t quite there but I’ve learnt from it.’
