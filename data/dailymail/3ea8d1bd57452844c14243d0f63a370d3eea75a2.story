In recent weeks, we've become more accustomed to seeing Ferne McCann posing in her lingerie but the TOWIE star has put her clothes on for a change - and she's designed them herself, in fact.

The 23-year-old has unveiled her second exclusive fashion collection with Lasula and promises her 40-piece collection - called #FML - encompasses this season's hottest catwalk trends combined with chic wardrobe staples that can be dressed up or down.

Ferne maintains that her new range embraces her 'eclectic' style and is a nod to girly glamour but with a quirky fashion-forward twist.

summery colours (dress, £42)

The Essex-born star has taken tips from the catwalk and her dresses come complete with graphic floral prints, feminine lace, neon pop-colours and classic monochrome hues.

Known for her love of getting glammed up for a night in Romford, Ferne has included every style of dress imaginable into her range; from skater dresses to billowing maxi skirts.

Speaking about the range, Ferne said: 'I am so excited to launch my exclusive SS14 collection with Lasula.

'I wanted to create a range that allowed girls to try the hottest fashion trends with confidence, knowing this collection offered pieces for every summer occasion. Each piece has been handpicked by me with the fashion-conscious girl in mind and no occasion missed out.

'There are some really cool pieces and the combination of quality and fast fashion makes this collection fun and wearable.'
