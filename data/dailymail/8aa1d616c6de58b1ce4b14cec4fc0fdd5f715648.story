One of the best parts about being on holiday is getting to sample local dishes and get a taste for the country you’re visiting.

In France, the aromas of wine and garlic fill the air, for example, while tomatoes and oil are synonymous with Italian delicacies. 

With this in mind, designers have created an infographic that reveals the three staple items found in the cuisine of individual countries or regions, and how they compare.

A total of 36 world cuisines were studied to establish the most popular and common ingredients. These include spices, herbs and oils. For example, cumin, coriander and turmeric are common ingredients in Bengal, but Central Asian cooking predominantly uses pine nuts, pistachios and cinnamon

spices, herbs and oils.  

Designers in particular studied the 
ingredients used in national dishes of the chosen regions, including 
tagines and cous cous for Morrocco, mole pablano in Mexico, and pot-au-feu in France.

The most popular spice worldwide is cumin, according to the graphic, with coriander being the most used herb.

Garlic is popular in nine regions, including France, Italy and Spain. 

For example, cumin, coriander and turmeric are common ingredients across food in Bengal, but Central Asian cooking predominantly uses pine nuts, pistachios and cinnamon.

For regions that don’t have national dishes, or have multiple dishes that are popular in specific towns, the researchers combined the recipes.

Some are synonymous with the region, including paprika in Louisiana, and lemon in Greek cuisine.

But others are less obvious, including sour oranges, famous in Yucatan Chicken, and apples in Normandy, used in the Chicken Normandy dish.

A number of popular ingredients are local delicacies, grown in the regions where they're most frequently used. For example, Hawaiian cooking predominantly features the kukui nut, taken from the island's state tree the kukui, or candlenut tree (pictured)
