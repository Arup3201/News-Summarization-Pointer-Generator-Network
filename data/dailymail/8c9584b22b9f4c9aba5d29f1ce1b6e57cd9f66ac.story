Zookeepers have welcomed a new lion cub - but not the tricky task of weighing her.

Karis is the second lion cub to be born at Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling and handlers had to use a sack to get her on the scales.

Weighing in at 5kg, the cub will stay with her mother until she is 12 weeks old before they are returned to the pride.

Weight-in: The lion cub registered a healthy 5kg when she was dropped into a sack and popped on the scales

Two pairs of hands: Mr Reid is given a hand to balance Karis, who is putting up a bit of a fight, on the scales

Stuggle: The lioness cub registered a healthy 5kg, but had to be wrestled into a sack for her weigh-in

Hiss: There is no doubting Karis' fierce creature credentials as she snarls at the photographer

Park manager Gary Gilmour said: 'Even though she is a wee cutie, keepers had to use a hessian sack to help with the weigh-in, as even at five weeks old she is a real handful and can still give a nasty scratch.'

Registering a healthy 5kg on the scales, the lioness cub will stay with her mother until she is 12 weeks old before they pair rejoin the pride.

She is expected to grow to around 150kg and brings the Blair Drummond pride to eight lions in total.

Mr Reid said: 'Teekay and Karis have been bonding in the 
house next door to the main pride, so everyone knows there is a new kid 
on the block, but we just want to make sure that Karis is a good size 
before we mix her with the rest of pride.'

Park manager Gary Gilmour added: 'Even though she is a wee cutie, keepers
had to use a hessian sack to help with the weigh-in, as even at five 
weeks old she is a real handful and can still give a nasty scratch.'

Swipe: She may only be one month old, but already Karis can deliver a vicious scratch with her paws

Big girl: At 5kg, Mr Reid can still hold her aloft, but one day she will grow into a truly fearsome creature

On the prowl: She will rejoin the pride after 12 weeks and when fully grown is expected to weight 150kgs

Snarl: Karis pulls the type of expression that makes lions the most feared creatures in the jungle

Adorable: She will one day by able to kill a man with a single swipe of her paw, but for now, at least, she's cute

Put me down: The cub appears to object to being held aloft by doting head keeper Brian Reid
