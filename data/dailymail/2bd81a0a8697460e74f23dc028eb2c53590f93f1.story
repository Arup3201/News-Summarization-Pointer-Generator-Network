It is usually wildlife that avoids traffic, but on one street in Sunderland drivers have found the roles reversed as they are forced to avoid a feisty pheasant.

The bird in Houghton-le-Spring is particularly hostile towards red vehicles, meaning the local postmen have suffered more than most.

Neil Fogg, who does the round, said it follows him through the whole estate. He added: â€˜It has pecked me before and pecked at the wheels of the post van.â€™

The postman added: 'It
 used to follow me the whole way through the whole estate, but luckily 
it now only follows me near the entrance into the estate.'

Residents in the street in Houghton-Le-Spring, Sunderland, said that while the bird is 'quite amusing' they are worried it might get hurt.

Zoe Hughes, 20, said that the bird seemed to hassle her every time she makes a journey.

The nursery nurse said: 'It chases me most mornings. I'm scared in case I run it over - I lose view of it all the time.'

Maureen McPherson, a retired teacher, added: 'It follows my red car, but not my husband's car. It has even chased my daughter when she's gone for a jog.

'I've even had to get out of the car and try and shoo it away, but it doesn't run away, it just stands and flaps its wings.

Despite the hassle the bird causes them, residents of Houghton-le-Spring, pictured, say that they have taken a particular shine to the bird

'It is quite interesting to watch what he's up to in the street though; we haven't actually seen him in a few weeks.'

Despite the hassle it causes them, residents say that they have taken a particular shine to the bird, who they have named Sebastian.

Some of them even begin to worry if the bird disappears from the spot it likes to 'patrol' daily.
