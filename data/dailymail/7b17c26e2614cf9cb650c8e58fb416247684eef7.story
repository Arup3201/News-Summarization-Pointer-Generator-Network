An animal act billed as the world’s smallest pony has been kidnapped from a horse fair in Italy.

Charlie, who is just 63cm tall, was snatched from his stall overnight in the Umbrian town of Città di Castello.

Police believe the mafia may be holding Charlie for ransom.

He was due to perform at the show with his owner but ‘equestrian artist’ Bartolo Messina was forced to alert police when he found the pony’s stall empty.

Police are investigating the theory that the mafia may be involved and believe the thieves could be holding the pony for ransom.

The tiny show-pony was in the central Italian town for the 47th edition of the National Horse Fair.

Police said that the horse thieves snipped a wire fence surrounding the fairgrounds, grabbed the miniature pony and made off through a nearby tobacco field where a car was waiting to speed them away.

A spokesman for the Carabinieri in Citta di Castello said: ‘Investigations are continuing. We are not excluding any possibilities including that the perpetrators are part of a criminal organisation.’

The President of the National Horse Show Angelo Capecci called the theft ‘a shameful act’.

He said: ‘We were victims of a serious crime that offends and humiliates the equine world.’ ‘The security measures that for years have ensured the safety of the participants and that have always prevented the occurrence of similar incidents, were apparently undermined by a shameful act that does not reflect the horse world and its values. ‘

He added: ‘We sympathise with Bartolo Messina, a great equestrian artist who loves and lives by his horses, and had trained the victim of this sad episode with extraordinary kindness and ability .’
