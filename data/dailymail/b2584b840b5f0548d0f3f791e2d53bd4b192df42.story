LOCKED IN by Richard Marsh and Jeff Hudson (Piatkus, £12.99) 

‘Don't do it! I’m begging you. Please, don’t kill me!’ Inside his head, Richard Marsh screamed the words. But no sound came from his mouth.

After a major stroke, the 60-year-old former policeman-turned-teacher was in intensive care, paralysed, unable to move a single part of his body. To the outside world, he appeared dead, hence the conversation going on between his wife, Lili, and the doctor.

‘Rich has been here for two days, and shown no sign of improvement,’ said the doctor. ‘He has less than a 2 per cent chance of surviving two days.’ He explained how Richard’s body had shut down — his internal organs operational only with the aid of machines, his brain all but switched off, as it had been starved of oxygen.

As Richard lay there, he was cruelly aware of a discussion he and Lili had had some months earlier. If either was ever in the state the doctor had just described, the other would agree to life support being terminated.

There was a tense few minutes while Lili considered. Finally, she said she’d like to consult Rich’s three grown-up daughters. She’d tell the doctor tomorrow. Through the longest night of his life, Rich imagined the arguments that would decide his fate batting back and forth at home.

Earlier, he’d come as close as anyone can to being at his own funeral, as family members trooped in to say farewell. His best friend Steve had made a 750-mile journey, touching Rich gently and saying: ‘Goodbye, old friend.’

But the funeral never happened. Waking after the stroke, Rich was relieved to hear the rise and fall of his breath. He decided to test it by holding his breath, and found the rhythm of his breathing continued — a machine was doing it for him.

He tried to turn his head, but his neck was unresponsive; likewise, his arms, his legs and eyelids. Yet he could hear everything that was going on around him.

Remarkably, the first improvement came during that night, as he lay with the TV on. Eventually, the bright lights on the screen began to hurt his eyes. So, he blinked.

His eyelids had been opening and closing involuntarily. But this was the first time he had controlled the movement. He just needed to be able to do it when someone was watching, in order to save his life.

Next day, Lili told the doctors the family wasn’t ready to pull the plug. Then, one of the doctors began staring at Rich. He’d seen him blink. A neurologist was summoned, who said: ‘Rich, if you can hear me, blink for “yes”.’ He obliged.

Rich was told he had locked-in syndrome. If he stayed alive, his condition would be all but unbearable. But the blinking proved the first of many small steps towards recovery, and enabled him to communicate via blinking at letters on a white board.

he was given intensive physiotherapy on his legs and arms to prevent his muscles atrophying, and restore muscle memory. When he moved his tongue, the staff started him on speech therapy. After three-and-a-half months, he was able to mumble: ‘Thanks.’

Seven months after his stroke, he had almost fully recovered. Three years later, he’s visiting the gym and cycling everywhere.

Locked In is Rich’s story of what this terrifying condition is actually like, and how he survived.
