Raffaele Sollecito last night suggested his relationship with Amanda Knox was the only reason he was found guilty of murdering British student Meredith Kercher.

The 29-year-old spoke out to Anderson Cooper after an Italian court's decision to reinstate his conviction in the 2007 murder and appeared to imply that Knox’s unpopularity in Italy meant he was doomed to be found guilty again.

'I'm guilty just because in their minds I have to be guilty because I was her boyfriend. It doesn't make any sense to me,' he said on CNN.

Guilty by association: Amanda Knox's Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito appeared on CNN from Italy Monday night following a new decision to reinstate his 25 year prison sentence for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher

Sollecito and Knox were originally sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison, respectively, and served four years before being released in 2011.

Upon her release Knox went back to her home in Seattle, Washington and when the case went into retrial last year, she refused to return to Italy. 

Diplomats have said no Secretary of State would ever extradict Knox back to Italy, but Italian Sollecito has attended the whole re-trial knowing there was a real threat he could be sent back to prison.

'I'm trying to be as positive as possible in a situation like this,' he said. 'It's very traumatic, the situation here now. But on the other side, I still have to fight. I have chosen to be here and to fight against this ordeal.'

Misunderstanding: Raffaele dismissed reports he was trying to flee Italy this morning and claimed he was actually returning to the country after hearing the guilty verdict

'I don't know what to think, because 
objectively, there's nothing against me and nothing very strong against 
Amanda,' Sollecito added.

Sollecito's sentence will not be imposed until the Italian Supreme Court confirms it at a hearing next year.

The
 day after the guilty verdict was announced, it seemed as though 
Sollecito was trying to flee the country when he was arrested 40 
kilometers from the Austrian border at a hotel in the Italian village of
 Venzone.

But he told CNN 
that he went to Austria to celebrate the decision with his girlfriend, 
since he expected to be cleared of all charges and drove back into Italy
 'as soon as I understood the verdict.'

On
 Thursday – the day of  the verdict – he left the court at 10:30am as 
the panel of judges went out to consider their decision.

By the time they returned to announce the verdict, Sollecito was nowhere to be seen.

His lawyer claimed he was still in Florence, but ‘too stressed’ to attend.

While both Sollecito and Knox were re-convicted of Kercher's murder last week, neither will be forced to serve time until the sentence is confirmed by an Italian Supreme Court.

Both parties are appealing the guilty verdict, and will remain free in the meantime.

Their case will again be heard in front of Italy's highest court, the court of cassation, which ordered the retrial earlier last year.

The high court will be able to overturn the guilty verdict if it finds errors in the law were made by the lower court.

Both parties may have an advantage in their next hearing, following a misstep on the part of the presiding judge in the most recent case.

Judge Alessandro Nencini gave interviews to three Italian newspapers, commenting on the case just a few days before giving out her final decision.

In one interview, Nencini said Sollecito may have made a mistake by not testifying in the trial.

However, Sollecito's lawyers point out that he was never asked to submit to a cross examination.

They add that Nencini's public comments show bias and taint the verdict.

'The conviction is the result of a clear bias on the part of the judges against the defendants and in particular against Raffaele Sollecito, and that interview proves it,' his defense lawyer Luca Maori told Corriere della Sera.

In
 fact he and his girlfriend Greta Menegaldo, a 23-year-old model, were 
already on their way to Italy’s north-east border with Austria.

The pair had met while studying at the University of Verona and are said to have become close.

Miss
 Menegaldo, who is  from Treviso, near Venice, has previously 
accompanied Sollecito on a holiday to South America, where her parents 
now live.

A Mini Cooper belonging to her father was spotted heading to 
the Italian-Austrian border on Thursday while the judges were 
deliberating the case of Sollecito and Knox.

The car was already 200 miles from Florence.

Staff at the low-key Carnia hotel tipped off the police, after recognising Sollecito as he checked in at 1am.

At
 dawn he was taken to a police station in Udine where his passport was 
confiscated. He has been cautioned that  he is forbidden to leave the 
country,’ a spokesman for the police said.

‘His passport has been  taken away from him and his identity card has been stamped to show that he must not leave Italy.’

Sollecito
 told police he went on ‘a little trip into Austria, then came back to 
Italy’. According to reports in the Italian media, he added: ‘I stopped 
there to rest.’

He later released a statement saying he had ‘never 
thought of fleeing, before or now’.

Sollecito’s lawyer, Luca Maori, said his client had gone ‘willingly’ with police to give up his passport. 

The
 Florence court had ruled that there was a ‘real and present’ danger 
that Sollecito would flee the country and said he could not leave Italy 
again without permission  from a judge.

The
 judges said that although he had been present at some of the trial, 
Sollecito had shown an interest in obtaining ‘logistical support in 
countries with which Italy does not have relations of [mutual] judicial 
assistance’.

In addition to holidaying in the Dominican Republic earlier in the case, Sollecito sought work in Switzerland.

But he was forced to leave when the authorities discovered his legal obligations.
