A bungling Iranian bomber blew off his own legs when he hurled a grenade at Thai police outside a Bangkok school - which bounced off a tree and then exploded at his feet.

A bizarre sequence of explosions in the capital of Bangkok started this morning when a stash of explosives blew off the roof of a house occupied by three Iranians.

Two of the men quickly ran away while Saeid Moradi, who was seriously wounded, staggered out and tried to wave down a taxi.

Covered in blood, the driver refused to take him, and so he hurled a grenade at the vehicle. When police arrived on the scene he then tried to throw another at officers - but it bounced off a tree, landed at his feet, and blew off his legs.

Mistake: Iranian Saeid Moradi, who is still alive, had his legs blown off after a grenade he hurled bounced back onto him, as police closed in on him outside a Bangkok school

Moradi, who was taken to hospital, 
injured four people in the blasts which come the day after Israeli 
diplomats were targeted in simultaneous car bombings, also believed to 
have been carried out by Iranians.

Photographs and video footage of the wounded Moradi showed him covered in dark soot on a pavement strewn with broken glass. He lay in front of a Thai primary and secondary school, head raised as if he was attempting to sit up or look around.

It is not yet known if yesterday's and
 today's attacks are linked - but Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said the Bangkok violence 'proves once again that Iran and its proxies continue to perpetrate terror'.

Another government minister implied Israel would seek revenge, without mentioning Iran explicitly.

And public security minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch told Israel Radio: 'We know who carried out the terror attacks, we know who sent them, and Israel will settle the score with them.'

More explosives were found at Moradi's house, in the Ekamai area of central Bangkok, which police say he had been renting with two others.

He is believed to have arrived in Bangkok, from the southern Thai resort of Phuket, on February 8.

Warning: Israel and the U.S. have told their citizens to be alert in the capital

Police said security forces at Bangkok's international airport detained a second Iranian later today.

Mohummad Hazaei, one of the men in 
the house where the explosives first went off, was trying to board a 
flight for Malaysia. They said a third Iranian - believed wounded in 
that initial explosion - was also on the run.

Thailand has rarely been a target for
 foreign terrorists, although a domestic Muslim insurgency in the 
country's south has involved bombings of civilian targets.

Israel and the U.S. warned their 
citizens to be alert in the capital, but Thai authorities said the 
country appeared to have been a staging ground but not the target of any
 attack.

It comes the day after Israeli 
diplomats were targeted in simultaneous bomb plots which were also 
blamed on Iran. It is not known whether the attacks are linked.

A bomb attached magnetically to a car in 
the Indian capital New Delhi exploded and injured the wife of an Israeli
 official and two bystanders.

Officials in Georgia said an explosive device was attached to the bottom of a diplomatâ€™s car in the capital Tbilisi, but was found and defused before it detonated.

Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran was behind both incidents, adding that the Islamic republic's Lebanese ally Hezbollah - which battled Israel in a month-long war in 2006 - could have been involved too.

Last month, a Lebanese-Swedish man with alleged links to Hezbollah militants was detained by Thai police.

He led authorities to a warehouse filled with more than 4,000kilos of urea fertiliser and several gallons of liquid ammonium nitrate.

Fireball: The Bangkok blasts came the day after Israeli diplomats were targeted in simultaneous bomb plots which were also blamed on Iran. A bomb attached magnetically to a car in the Indian capital New Delhi exploded and injured the wife of an Israeli official and two bystanders

Closer examination: Indian security and forensic officials examine the car on Monday - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately blamed Iran for the attacks
