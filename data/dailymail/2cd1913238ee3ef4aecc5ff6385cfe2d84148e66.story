Tiger Woods has started hitting full shots with a driver again, raising hopes that he might be able to make his comeback at the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool next month.

The 38-year-old American, who missed the first two majors of the season following back surgery, has been seen on the range at the Medallist club, near his home in Jupiter, Florida.

Although it’s a long way from picking up a driver again to playing in the game’s showpiece event, the fact Woods is able to practice with every club in the bag for the first time in three months suggests his return to the game might not be too far away.

Multiple sources told the Golf Channel in America that Woods is targeting the Open, which is still four weeks away and where he claimed one of his most famous major victories in 2006.

That came just a month after the death of his father Earl, and Woods wept openly on the 18th green as he dedicated his triumph to the man who taught him the game.

For the sport itself, the return of the 14-time major champion cannot come soon enough.

Martin Kaymer’s eight-stroke triumph in the US Open on Sunday proved a huge turn-off for television audiences, with viewing figures in America down as much as 70 per cent on Justin Rose’s narrow victory over Phil Mickelson a year earlier.

Woods's agent Mark Steinberg told the PGA Tour's website: 'Tiger is making continual progress.

'He feels better each day and (is able to) extend his swing as he moves forward.'
