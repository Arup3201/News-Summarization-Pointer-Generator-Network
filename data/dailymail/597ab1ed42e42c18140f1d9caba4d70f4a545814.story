Luis Enrique says England's lack of a winter break may have given Barcelona an advantage against Manchester City – and he hopes the Premier League don't change their fixture list.

Manuel Pellegrini suggested after City's 1-0 defeat in the Nou Camp that the number of games English clubs played in December and January meant they struggled in the latter stages of the Champions League.

City's 3-1 aggregate defeat followed Arsenal's exit at the hands of Monaco on Tuesday and Chelsea's defeat by Paris Saint-Germain last week – leaving no English clubs in the last eight of the Champions League for the second time in three seasons.

And Enrique has some sympathy for Pellegrini.

'We are used to resting during winter with our families,' Enrique said. 'I heard (Southampton manager) Ronald Koeman complaining about the number of fixtures in England, so maybe it is an advantage for us.

'I don't know, it is impossible to say, but we do enjoy watching the English teams playing on Boxing Day.'

Speaking after the game, Pellegrini suggested the heavy fixture scheduling played a part in City's demise.

Lionel Messi's Barcelona eliminated City by beating them 3-1 on aggregate in the Champions League

For the second time in three years, there are not any English teams in the last eight of the Champions League

Pellegrini said: 'It is difficult to analyse because the Premier League is strong, with money and very good players.

'We play so many games in December and January and we are not fresh in February. In Spain, Italy and Germany they stop playing. Last year we played nine games in December and nine in January, and that was before we played Barcelona.'
