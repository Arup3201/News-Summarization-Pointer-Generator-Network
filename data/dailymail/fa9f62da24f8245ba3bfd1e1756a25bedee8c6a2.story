A driver has died after he was stabbed before climbing into his car and crashing into a London bus during rush hour yesterday.

The victim has today been named as 22-year-old Femi Junaid, from Peckham, South London.

Police said Mr Junaid died in hospital last night following the crash near Stockwell underground station shortly before 5.45pm.

The Met's homicide and major crime command has launched a murder investigation and says Mr Junaid's death could be linked to an argument on a bus nearby.

A spokesman said: 'Detectives believe Femi was stabbed in Clapham Road, some 50 yards from the scene of the collision, before getting into his car and colliding with the bus.

'We are not aware of any other people injured and we do not believe anyone else was in the car with Femi at the time of the collision.'

A post-mortem examination has yet to be held.
