Cristiano Ronaldo has redefined the notion of 'world class', energising the tired term and catapulting it to a far higher plain.

He has reinvented the manner in which we digest football numbers.

Ronaldo has – albeit with the aid of Lionel Messi – driven back the boundaries of footballing capability.

On Wednesday night, the Real Madrid superstar – with 271 goals in 258 games for Los Blancos - comes up against another player – 10 years his junior - who is fast changing the criteria by which we judge emerging talent.

At 19 years of age, Liverpool starlet Raheem Sterling is already the subject of national obsession within these shores, evidenced no less by the recent 'tiredgate' furore.

Watch him on a football pitch, however, and it is easy to see why there is a fixation with his development. 

But can Sterling, like Ronaldo, take his potential and turn it into goals and assists, goals and assists, season after season, season after season?

Ronaldo was once labelled a 'skinny kid' during his time at United but has since developed into a top athlete 

After all, the England forward once said: 'I really look up to Cristiano Ronaldo, he is someone that has always been an idol to me.

'I try not to put pressure on myself, but I'm looking to improve my goals-to-game ratio and try to chip in more for the team.

'If I am not scoring I need to be assisting and making goals which is a massive part of my game which I need to improve on really. That is my main aim this season to get that goals-per-game ratio up.'

Here, ahead of the Champions League showdown at Anfield, Sportsmail compares Sterling to a rookie Ronaldo during his early years at Manchester United…

Sterling, six weeks shy of his 20th birthday, has already made 68 Premier League appearances

Style

At 19, Ronaldo was all scissor-turns and step-overs. He still is, of course, only now he invariably sticks the ball in the back of the net after such pageantry.

Sterling is already more direct, the tricks and flicks which characterised his game at 17 having made way for a more instinctive approach.

Both, of course, catch the eye with what is an increasingly rare ability to weave between defenders, leaving opponents in their wake and so exciting observers.

Stature

Don't forget, Ronaldo was once a 'skinny kid'. Only later did he develop the world's most recognisable – and muscle bound – torso. At 19 there was accusation that he toppled too easily and suspicion remained about his suitability for the Premier League.

Sterling's strength belies his diminutive size and it is said he has few rivals when it comes to bench-pressing in the gym at Melwood. Opponents bounce off him in often comical fashion having under-estimated his power.

Mentality

Roy Keane spoke glowingly of a teenage Ronaldo's mindest and attitude in his recent book. And it is that focus and determination which has allowed him to maximise his abilities.

Forget physical attributes, it is – and always has been – Ronaldo's mental strength which tears him apart from the rest.

Sterling, of course, has not been without his off-field distractions. They can be forgiven for one so young, but failure to learn from such will only hinder his progress on the pitch.

How badly he wants to emulate the achievements of Ronaldo will ultimately determine his success.

The Numbers

And so to the stats. Sterling, six weeks shy of his 20th birthday, has already made 68 Premier League appearances.

Ronaldo was still 20, but a little older, by the time he reached that mark.

But this, we feel, is fair ground for comparison…

Goals

Ronaldo 9 Sterling 14

The Liverpool forward returned an impressive nine last season and already has three from five this time around.

Ronaldo, meanwhile, made a slower start in front of the posts and only managed a total of nine during his first two campaigns.

Shot conversion rate

Ronaldo 6% Sterling 19.4%

Ronaldo loves to shoot, he always has. But 10 years ago a staggering 94 per cent of his efforts failed to go in. Sterling fares far better, one in five of his strikes locating the back of the net.

Even Sterling's shooting accuracy (56.9 per cent), outdoes Ronaldo (41.7 per cent).

Assists (chances created)

Ronaldo 8 (90) Sterling 9 (112)

Sterling edges the goal assists by one, but perhaps he should look to his Liverpool team-mates for reason as to why that figure is not higher having laid on 112 chances.

Dribbles completed

Ronaldo 182 Sterling 165

What makes the pair so exciting is their willingness to get at opponents and Ronaldo boasts slightly better numbers in this respect.

Win percentage

Ronaldo 58.8% Sterling 55.9%

Football, of course, is ultimately about winning matches. And it is Ronaldo who helped Manchester United to more victories during his early years, although only just.

Verdict

The raw numbers have Sterling slightly ahead of Ronaldo at this juvenile juncture. But what the Portugal forward has gone on to achieve is sensational. He has, as alluded to at the top, reformulated football.

Sterling can have no better role model, no better target to chase down.

On Wednesday night, at Anfield, his idol becomes an adversary - there is no better stage for the boy to outshine the man he one day wishes to emulate.
