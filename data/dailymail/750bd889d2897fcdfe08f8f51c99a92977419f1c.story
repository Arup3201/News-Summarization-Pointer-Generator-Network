For Patricia Whitfield, a 71-year-old pensioner from Hartlepool, life has become a daily battle against pain and immobility.

The reason: her weight. Tipping the scales at 27st, Patricia's weight problems have become so bad, she hasn't left the house unassisted for five years and spends nearly all of her time on a chair in her sitting room.

Now Patricia, who appears in Channel 5 documentary Bigger Body Squad: Off The Scale, has been told she must lose weight or face an uncertain future.

Miserable: Patricia Thornhill spends most of her time in her sitting room and hasn't left the house for five years

'Just living in these four walls is about as far as I get,' she says of her limited lifestyle. 'One room is not enough.

'I can stand up - this chair helps me but I don't know if I can to walk to the back door.'

Patricia's problems began when she was diagnosed with lymphoedema - a chronic condition that affects the joints and makes walking painful.

As a result, she has gained another two stone since being diagnosed with the disease - a complication that has made getting her to the clinic for treatment enormously difficult.

Currently, the NHS spends £3m a year ferrying morbidly obese patients such as Patricia to and from doctor's appointments and it's a figure that looks set to grow, with more than 40 per cent of British pensioners classified as overweight or obese.

Struggle: As a result of her weight and lymphoedema, Patricia cannot walk just 12ft to her front door

'Our stretcher is a specialist stretcher for bariatric patients and has side wings that pop out,' explains Ian Wheatley, the bariatric paramedic tasked with getting Patricia out of her house and to the clinic.

But getting her out of the door is a problem because not only is Patricia unable to walk, she's in constant pain.

Eventually, she's helped out of the house in a wheelchair before being winched into an ambulance, although even that proves exhausting.

'I'm in so much pain,' she complains as she completes her 12ft journey. But despite the pain, Patricia has so far failed to lose any weight - much to the disapproval of nurse Kerry Wood.

'[Patricia's] weight has increased over the last few years,' she explains. 'And as a result, her lymphoedema has worsened.

'If she lost weight, it would dramatically improve her 
mobility and I suspect it might take some of the pressure off her knees as 
well so she could become more mobile.

'Losing some weight would have 
quite an impact on her lymphoedema as a whole.'

For now, Patricia has returned home to sit on the same chair in the same sitting room in the same home. The only change? Thornton's chocolate is off the menu.
