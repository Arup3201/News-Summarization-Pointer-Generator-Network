Dame Maggie Smith has said portraying the withering Dowager Countess of Grantham on Downton Abbey has made her too famous to go out alone.

On a recent visit to Paris, the 79-year-old actress said she was 'besieged' by American fans of the ITV drama.

'That's never happened to me before,' she said, according to the Telegraph.

The actress said she was 'besieged' by American fans of Downton Abbey while in Paris for her latest project 

'It's very difficult when you're alone because you have no escape.'

She added: 'It was awful. I love wandering round on my own and I just couldn't.'

Dame Maggie was in the French city filming 'My Old Lady' which is set to be released this month.

A full interview with the actress will appear in Saturday's Review magazine. 

Last month, the actress was honoured by the Queen at Windsor Castle and made a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, joining an illustrious group of recipients - including Professor Stephen Hawking and painter David Hockney.

She's also been nominated for an Oscar six times, winning two for The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie in 1969 and California Suite in 1978.
