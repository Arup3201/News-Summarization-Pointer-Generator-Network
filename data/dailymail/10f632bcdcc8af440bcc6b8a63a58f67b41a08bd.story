An outspoken, conservative Republican congressman from Texas, was letting his own staff and volunteers work and even sleep on the floor in filthy, disgusting conditions, whilst he campaigned for re-election.

The campaign headquarters of Texas House Republican and Senate candidate Steve Stockman were shut down after they were deemed 'unsafe for habitation.'

Talking Points Memo filed a request to see the photos of the condemned building, and managed to obtain pictures showing what looks like the decaying debris and detritus of a dilapidated dorm room.

Toilet training required: Pictures have been released that show the disgusting conditions volunteers working for outspoken Texas Republican Steve Stockman, were working in

Hell-hole: Incredibly, between six and eight staffers and volunteers were sleeping here each night - even though there was no proper bedding or fire safety precautions

The photos show exposed electrical outlets, furniture that is literally falling apart and levels of hygiene that leave much to be desired, together with a filthy George Foreman grill.

The place looks as though it is falling apart at the seams, and yet Stockman's campaign staffers were spending the night in the building that was a former motorcycle shop.

The place is about as far away from a 'political campaign office,' as can be imagined.

It's hard to know where workers would have conducted strategy meetings, let alone plugged in laptops safely or even had the desire to cook from the greasy grill.

Controversy: Steve Stockman is no stranger to drama having already this year attempted to give away a rifle to subscribers to his online mailing list and suggested that unborn babies should be given handguns

Things got so bad the fire marshal and city building officials in Webster, Texas ended up ordering the emergency closure of the unorthodox campaign headquarters.

Despite the commercial building was considered 'unsafe for human habitation', according to Webster city records, between six and eight staffers continued to work and sleep there.

Inspectors found bunk beds had been added in the commercial building, but there were no smoke detectors or fire extinguishers.

Among the fire code violations were faulty or spliced wiring and other electrical hazards, including no illuminated exit signs, improper exit doors and combustible material - mainly Stockman's campaign signs, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Furthermore, no one had obtained the necessary permit for the campaign to legally occupy the pale yellow two-story metal building.

Some HQ! The campaign was ran out of a rusty old motorcycle shop based at the end of a junkyard that was falling apart both inside and outside. Despite not paying any rent on the building the campaign is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt

Right wing: Congressman Stockman sells himself as the most conservative member of Congress, though he has not been ranked as such

Stockman represents a district of southeast Texas that was created as a result of the 2010 census, so he is the first to serve as its representative. He previously served as a congressman from 1995 to 1997.

While his local staff is focusing on re-election efforts, his campaign is also digging itself further into debt.

According to its latest report, Stockman's campaign committee has only $32,000 and debts of $163,000, including funds owed to the congressman himself.

At the time of his re-election in 2012, Stockman praised his campaign workers and mentioned that some had even slept on the mucky floor.

'I could not have done it without 
all the hard-working, grass-roots volunteers.

Believe me, we had them - 
young conservatives who came into an old motorcycle shop, worked the 
precincts and made phone calls, slept on the floor, and ate 
microwaved-meals.

There's nothing like volunteers who believe in a 
candidate and a cause.'

Campaign finance reports show that the Stockman campaign bought 'bedding for overnight volunteers' in February 2012 at Wal-Mart.

The campaign also bought air conditioning equipment and $812 in 'remodeling supplies' for its campaign headquarters that year.

'If babies had guns they wouldn't be aborted': Congressman Stockman's bumper sticker prompted immediate outrage. He was selling them to raise money for a campaign that is heavily in debt

The congressman is no stranger to controversy.

Earlier this year he boasted on Twitter that he is 'the most conservative Congressman in Texas,' and offered to give an AR-15 rifle to someone who joined his online mailing list.

The Stockman campaign also sparked outrage in April with a bumper sticker reading 'If babies had guns they wouldn't be aborted. Vote Pro-Life!

The slogan was deemed 'outrageous' by the masses on Twitter.

The statement was obviously intended to prompt outrage from critics and serve as a rallying cry from supporters, but a day after posting it to his Twitter feed, it apparently helped fund his campaign war chest for his 2014 re-election bid.

He may now be questioning the value of such shock tactics given that his campaign is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.
