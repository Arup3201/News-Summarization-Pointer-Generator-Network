Cleared: Merritt Landry, 33, of New Orleans, is no longer under investigation over the July shooting

The 33-year-old man who shot a teenage
 boy in the head after finding him in his gated driveway at 2am last 
July is no longer under investigation.

Father-of-two
 Merritt Landry, 33, of New Orleans, was facing a second-degree 
attempted murder charge after shooting Marshall Coulter, then 14, in the
 head, claiming he thought the teenager was going to rob him.

However,
 Orleans Parish District Attorney will no longer charge Mr Landry as the
 teenager has been arrested connection with burglaries in the same 
neighbourhood.

The incident last July left the now 15-year-old Marshall Coulter in critical condition and doctors feared he would not survive.

Mr
 Landry claimed he had found Coulter by his care in the gated driveway 
and when the teenager made a quick movement 'as if to reach for 
something,' so he shot him out of concern for his own safety, according 
to an arrest warrant.

Coulter was shot from 30 feet away, according to evidence recovered at the scene.

At
 the time, Coulter’s family members admitted that he had been involved 
in petty crimes, but that he would never touch a weapon. 

'He would steal - he was a professional thief, sure,' Coulter's 23-year-old brother, David, told the Times-Picayune at the time.

'But
 he would never pick up a gun, not in a million years. He was too scared
 to aim a gun at the grass, let alone aim it at a person. No way. Before
 he'll ever pick up a gun, he'll be your friend first.'

'He's
 still a little boy,' the brother added. 'Who pulls a trigger on a 
14-year-old? What if it was your little brother or your sister? How 
would you feel?'

David Coulter, the brother of injured teen Marshall Coulter, said his brother has been involved in petty crimes but would never been violent

However, 
although Coulter was unarmed when he was shot by Mr Landry, he was 
recently linked to a crime in 2012 when he is accused of entering a 
house where he stole a gun, threatened the homeowner and fled with the 
weapon.

Earlier this month 
Coulter was arrested after a homeowner in the Faubourg Marigny 
neighbourhood found him in his house, after which another resident in 
the area found that his CCTV system had captured Coulter attempting to 
break into his home.

‘Following
 Coulter's most recent burglary arrests, any case that this office had 
against Landry was irreversibly damaged,’ Orleans Parish District 
Attorney Leon Cannizzaro said in statement to NOLA.com

‘I
 am ethically obligated not to charge an individual against whom I do 
not possess evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that he 
committed a crime.

‘Such evidence does not exist in this case.’

The teen was unarmed and standing near Landry's vehicle, which was parked in the gated driveway in front of Landry's house (pictured) on Mandeville Street, when he was shot

It
 also appears that Coulter may have exaggerate his medical condition, as
 officials had been led to believe that he was still unable to walk 
without assistance.

The recent burglary arrests indicate otherwise.

As for Mr Landry, his legal representatives said he was ‘overjoyed’ by the District Attorney’s decision.

‘Merritt never wanted to be in a position to shoot anyone,’ Mr Landry’s attorney Roger Jordan told NOLA.com

‘He
 never wanted to be in the position where he had to defend his family, 
but he did that, and now he's had to live through this ordeal.’
