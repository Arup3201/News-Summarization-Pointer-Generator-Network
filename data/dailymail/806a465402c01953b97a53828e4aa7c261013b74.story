A father-of-three who survived the first case of bubonic plague in New York for more than 100 years has died.

John Tull, 65, from Santa Fe, New Mexico, was diagnosed with a rare cancer last month and passed away on Wednesday.

His wife Lucinda Marker, confirmed his death was not connected to the deadly bacterial infection he contracted 12 years ago.

In November 2002, the couple were on vacation in the Big Apple when both came down with flu-like symptoms, including a fever and swollen lymph nodes.

They were diagnosed with the plague, a disease that wiped out a third of the European population in the 14th century, an outbreak better known as the Black Death. 

It was considered New York's first plague case in more than a century, but doctors said Tull and Marker had likely become infected back home in Santa Fe, where dozens of cases have been reported in the last 50 years.

While Marker recovered within days, Tull was hospitalised for more than two months. He fell into a coma and both of his feet were amputated.

With the case coming in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks, there was speculation that it was the result of bioterrorists or criminals. 

Marker said she was questioned for days by a 'parade of people' from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FBI and New York City health officials. 

Dr. Ronald Primas, the New York physician who diagnosed and treated them, remembers the media frenzy surrounding their cases. 'I did like 40 interviews in two days,' he said.

Primas said everyone wanted to know if there was evidence the plague was caused by bioterrorist activity or if it would spread.

'Had (John) waited another day, had he gone out into the public with the cough he had, theoretically he could have spread it,' Primas said.

About seven plague cases are reported across the U.S. each year, and the disease can be treated with antibiotics, according to the CDC. 

Worldwide, between 1,000 and 2,000 cases are reported to the World Health Organization, the CDC says. 

Suffering: Mr Tull is wheeled out of a hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 12 years ago after receiving treatment for the bubonic plague. Both of his legs were amputated as a result 

Fleas that feed on infected rodents or other mammals typically transmit the plague bacteria. 

Researchers have said the case of Tull and Marker was pivotal in helping them understand why plague persisted in Santa Fe County, where the couple lived. 

The plague is endemic in the area, with dozens of cases being reported since 1949. 

Last year, three people, including an 11-year-old girl and 15-year-old boy were diagnosed with the plague in New Mexico.  

Despite his hardships, Tull faced everything with humor and a cheerful attitude, Marker said. 'He never stopped loving life — even after he woke up and had his legs amputated,' Marker said.

According to the Santa Fe New Mexican, which first reported Tull's death, the couple was writing a book about their experiences. Marker intends to finish it.

She said Tull would always advise people to be diligent and not let an illness or the recovery process wear them down.

'He would say, 'You've got to work as hard as you can when you are sick. When they tell you to do something, do it twice as hard,' Marker said.

Tull is survived by three children from two previous marriages.

Research suggests that the bubonic plague, which used to be associated with squalor, is on the increase in affluent communities in the U.S.

As more people move to natural environments where ground squirrels and woodrats live, infection increases.

The disease, associated with the medieval period and made famous by historic etchings, similar to the one below of a London town crier in 1665 calling for plague victims to be brought forward, is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis that is spread through flea bites.

Symptoms usually appear between two and five days after exposure to the bacteria.

They include gangrene of the extremities such as toes, fingers, lips and tip of the nose; fever; muscle cramps; seizures; lymph gland swelling.

Other potential symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood, aching limbs and extreme pain, usually caused by the decay of the skin while the person is still alive.

Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four days

About 11 cases of plague a year have occured in the U.S. since 1976. Most of them have been recorded in New Mexico. 

The most recent major outbreak was in Surat, India in 1994. It resulted in 52 deaths and a large internal migration of about 300,000 residents,
