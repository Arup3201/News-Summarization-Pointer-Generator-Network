Prosecutors presenting their case against two women charged in the beating death of a 23-year-old California nightclub goer showed today a short cellphone video where the victim could be seen being kicked in the head.

The jumpy recording depicts Annie Hung Kim Pham wrestling with another woman on a sidewalk.

As they struggle, a woman in a white blouse, black jacket and boots approaches and appears to kick Pham in the head.

Prosecutors say the kicker is murder suspect Vanesa Zavala. Immediately after the kick, Pham goes limp and the clip ends with her friends lifting her by her arms as they try to carry her away.

Zavala and Candace Brito have pleaded not guilty. A judge will determine after the two-day hearing that began Monday whether there is enough evidence to order them to stand trial.

Police have reviewed three videos of the violent confrontation from bystanders. Other footage appears to show Brito kicking Pham as well before Brito is knocked to the ground by another woman.

Investigators are still seeking to interview a third woman, identified in court testimony as ‘Amelia,’ who they say is the person wrestling on the ground with Pham when she is kicked.

Just who started the fight outside The Crosby in the early morning hours of Janiary 18 is in dispute.

A witness told authorities the fight began after Pham started swearing at a group of people that she and her friends had bumped into outside the club, and that Pham threw the first punch.

Zavala told police that Pham's first swing hit her and the fight began.

Plea: Posters put near the crime scene appealing for information about the tragic January incident

Pham's friends countered that three women in the other group attacked Pham without provocation after they bumped into her while trying to take a picture.

Defense attorneys have repeatedly indicated that Pham's friends might have minimized her role in the fight and their involvement.

They have also been picking at the police investigation, pointing out that detectives have not positively identified another woman who can be seen on video kicking at the woman who is fighting Pham.

‘You don't even know who that person is, do you? You don't even know if she's in any way connected to Ms. Pham, do you?’ Brito's attorney, Michael Molfetta, said to Santa Ana police Detective Leo Rodriguez.

‘You haven't investigated it because you've decided those two are guilty of murder and everybody else is a victim. That's why you haven't followed up on this, isn't it?’ Molfetta said to Rodriguez, who denied the statement.

Lawyers for both sides reached an agreement Tuesday about how to handle testimony from a homicide detective who went undercover while wearing a wire and got Zavala to talk about the fight.

The attorneys accepted as evidence for the preliminary hearing only that Zavala told Detective Patricia Navarro, ‘”She hit me first. I acted in self-defense.”’

On Monday, Judge Thomas J. Borris ordered Navarro to stop her testimony after she acknowledged going undercover as an inmate to record Zavala after she had requested a lawyer.

At a preliminary hearing Monday, Santa Ana police Detective Roland Andrade said he was told by a witness that Pham began swearing and was restrained by friends as the other group walked away.

However, when the three girls returned, Pham threw the first punch, Andrade quoted the eyewitness as saying in to the Westminster court.

Police are still investigating a third woman as a person of interest and have reviewed three cellphone videos of the fight.

Defense attorneys said Monday that the third, unidentified woman was actually the person who began fighting with Pham.

It was only after the two fell to the 
ground, pulling each other's hair and punching, that Brito, who was the 
unidentified woman's friend, kicked Pham in the head, Detective Matthew 
Mcleod said on the stand, summarizing the testimony of an eyewitness who
 also shot cellphone video.

Zavala then also kicked at Pham, after which Pham went limp and lost consciousness, he said.

Witnesses described her as still holding her hands to her face on the ground when paramedics arrived but seeming unresponsive.

Both women were picked out of a police photo lineup.

Mistake? A friend of the victim revealed that Kim Pham was outside The Crosby club when she may have accidentally wandered in front of a camera as a group of partygoers posed for a snapshot

Forensic Pathologist Dr. Etoi Davenport, who conducted the autopsy on Kim Pham. testifies about the blunt force trauma to Pham's brain during a preliminary hearing for Candace Marie Brito and Vanesa Zavala in the West Justice Center in Westminster on Monday

Kenneth Reed, an attorney for Zavala, introduced the idea that Pham's friends might have minimized their involvement and Pham's role in the fight.

'You just kind of took the story - "She got beat" - and you just kind of took the statements of these friends of hers?" Reed said. 'Fighting means fighting, more than one person fighting, right?'

Pham, who went by the first name Kim, graduated from Chapman University last year and would have celebrated her first wedding anniversary last month.

She was an aspiring writer whose work was published online and in an anthology of works by Vietnamese-American writers.unidentified woman was actually the person who began fighting with Pham.

Pham was taken off life support after the beating. The coroner listed Pham's cause of death as blunt force injury of the head.

She had bleeding in her brain, two blackened eyes and contusions behind her left ear and on the right side of her head, said Dr. Etoi Davenport, a coroner's forensic pathologist.

Disturbing: Police were quick to announce that they did not believe the attack was motivated by race, as the area has a large Vietnamese community that were concerned about a possible hate crime

On January 29, three days before what would have been her first wedding anniversary, hundreds of mourners attended her funeral held in Westminster, California on the outskirts of Los Angeles.

Her husband led the pallbearers who helped carry her casket to her cremation.

‘I always try to have a tough-guy mentality, be the protector of our family, but she was the one who taught me how to let down my guard and to share something beautiful,’ her stepbrother  Jason Nguyen said at the service.

Her family kept her on life support until they could donate her organs- only learning that she was an organ donor once they arrived at the hospital- which her family thinks is telling of the person she was.

Organ registry One Legacy site announced that Pham's donations helped save five lives.

Her heart, kidneys, lungs, pancreas and liver were used for critical patients and her donated skin tissue was used for burn dressings, bones that could help fractures and prevent amputations, and her bone marrow is available for orthopedic use.

'She always put others' needs before herself and never thought badly of anyone. She kept love in the center of her life and preached kindness and respect for others.

'We will always remember her as a sweet, vibrant, and wise daughter, sister, and friend. She is our little angel and God's gift to all of us.'

So far two women are in police custody and investigators have released the photo of a third woman that they think may have information pertaining to the attack.

Vanesa Tapia Zavala, 25, was arrested at the end of January and is accused of taking part in the early morning beating.

She entered a not guilty plea but remains in police custody on $1million bail. She faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted.

Violent Police say a fight broke out between Pham and another woman, whose friends then stepped in

Candace Marie Brito, 27, has been identified as the second suspect and has been arrested for her alleged involvement in the attack. She entered a plea of not guilty.

A third woman’s photo has been released in hopes that someone will recognize her and help the police get in touch with her as they believe she has some information about the incident.

The Los Angeles Times reports that one of Ms Pham’s friends who was not at the nightclub at the time of the attack heard that Ms Pham accidentally walked into the background of a photo and the subjects who had intended to be the focus of the shot attacked her in retribution.
