Manchester United have pencilled in two dates towards the end of January as possibles for a lucrative overseas friendly.

With United not playing in Europe this season, the club are keen to make up some of the lost revenue by arranging an exhibition game overseas, more than likely in the Middle East. 

UEFA rules forbid such a game taking place in a week when European competition is taking place as they don't like members clubs staging friendlies that may shift focus away from the Champions League and Europa League.

Manchester United are eyeing up two dates in January for a lucrative overseas friendly

Louis van Gaal was not happy about the pre-season tour to America but isn't opposed to January friendlies

*TV dates yet to be anounced

January 1: Stoke (h)

TBC: FA Cup third round

January 10: Southampton (h)

January 17: QPR (a)

TBC: FA Cup fourth round

January 31: Leicester (h) 

However, United have identified the weeks beginning January 19 and January 26 as potential dates. These are the weeks the Capital One Cup semi-finals will be played and are free for United as Louis van Gaal's team have already exited the competition.

United have said that they will not plan anything without the agreement of Van Gaal and are aware that the issue is a sensitive one in the wake of the Dutch veteran's complaints about too much travelling during the club's pre-season tour of America.

However, Van Gaal has subsequently said he would not be opposed to the idea.

The United boss insisted: 'I agree with that idea.

'We (the club and I) have spoken last week with each other and also (chief executive) Ed Woodward, so I fully agree.

'It's good because I like to play games against high-level opponents.'

United are likely to seek a game somewhere like Dubai or Qatar and may even to return to Saudi Arabia, where Sir Alex Ferguson took his team for warm weather training several years ago.
