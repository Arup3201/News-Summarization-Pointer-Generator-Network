Maverick Tory MP Michael Fabricant was sacked as the party’s vice-chairman last night over his ‘uncontrollable’ behaviour on Twitter – including jokes about having an affair with a llama and criticism of senior ministers.

Mr Fabricant, one of Parliament’s most colourful MPs, has built up a cult following on the social media site with his edgy comments and lewd jokes.

But his outpourings have caused alarm at Tory high command in recent months.

Message: The former Whip informed his Twitter followers after he was removed from his position

'I'd prefer to date Farage than Clegg'

The final straw appears to have been a
 series of hostile messages about beleaguered Culture Secretary Maria 
Miller, culminating in one saying ‘about time’ when she finally resigned
 yesterday morning.

He 
later added: ‘Note to self: If ever a minister again, be like Mark 
Harper. If in trouble, resign quickly and in a dignified manner.’ Last 
night he was summoned for talks with Conservative Party chairman Grant 
Shapps and asked to resign. When he refused, he was sacked.

A
 source close to Mr Shapps last night insisted that his departure was 
mainly down to his opposition to the Government’s plans for a new 
high-speed rail line between London, Birmingham and the North of 
England.

The £50billion HS2 line would carve a swathe through Mr Fabricant’s Lichfield constituency.

He
 has tabled an amendment to the legislation which would kill the plans 
if it is backed by MPs later this month. He has also vowed to defy a 
three-line whip to vote against the main legislation.

He
 is one of around 30 MPs along the line of the route who are expected to
 rebel against the plans when they come to the Commons at the end of 
this month.

‘This has been 
coming for a while,’ the source said. ‘You can’t have a vice-chairman of
 the party publicly defying the Government and trying to kill off a key 
piece of legislation.’

The
 source acknowledged that Mr Fabricant’s public criticism of Mrs Miller 
and the former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell had also played a
 part in his departure, but insisted it was ‘amicable’.

Another
 senior Tory source said Mr Fabricant’s Twitter outpourings were the 
main reason for his sacking. ‘David Cameron once said too many tweets 
make a t***, and this is a case in point,’ the source said.

Mr
 Fabricant, 63, announced his sacking to his 14,900 followers on Twitter
 last night, saying: ‘Been asked to resign as Vice Chairman, refused, so
 sacked over HS2 and my views on a recent Cabinet Minister. Still 
available for speeches etc.’

He
 added: ‘Now free to speak openly about llamas (in-joke) and other 
matters.’ The message was a reference to a Twitter exchange earlier this
 year, after Mr Fabricant had tweeted his condemnation of Vladimir 
Putin’s gay rights record.

When
 a reader asked about his own sexuality, Mr Fabricant replied he was 
having an affair with a llama but would not reveal its gender.

A
 source at the time said the party’s high command was unamused, adding: 
‘No 10 says it has had enough problems with the party in getting equal 
marriage through without you advocating bestiality.’ Another Tory last 
night described Mr Fabricant as ‘uncontrollable’.

For
 years the MP was best known at Westminster for his extraordinary blond 
hair, which he has always denied is a wig. But his Twitter fame has 
enabled him to build up a wider profile, including an appearance on Have
 I Got News For You.

Opinion: Earlier in the day, he made his views on Miller's expenses scandal known. Hours later the Culture Secretary resigned from her position

Bizarre: Following his sacking, the MP said: 'Now free to speak openly about llamas'

Criticism: The colourful MP also had outspoken views of the £50billion HS2 rail link

Ousted: Mr Fabricant was asked to resign, but refused, so was sacked by party chairman Grant Shapps (pictured)
