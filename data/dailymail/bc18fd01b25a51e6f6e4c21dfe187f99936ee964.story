While fans were focused on a Red Sox outfielder’s gentlemanly rescue of a spectator’s cell phone, the woman behind her was left all wet by a beer to the face.

All faces pointed to the sky as a ball went soaring into the stands in a Wednesday game against the Detroit Tigers, forcing Shane ‘Flyin’ Hawaiian’ Victorino to stay true to his name and leap into the stands to make a catch.

Fans were shocked as Victorino tumbled into their midst. One Red Sox fanatic in particular flailed with so much excitement he knocked a woman’s cell phone from her hands and onto the field.

As Victorino stooped to retrieve the phone, the flailing fan again jumped for joy. This time, video clearly shows he knocked his neighbor’s beer all over her face and shirt.

But even covered in beer, the woman likely went home happy after the home team Red Sox pummeled the Tigers 20 to 4.
