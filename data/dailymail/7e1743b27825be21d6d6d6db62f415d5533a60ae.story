MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff 

Malky Mackay was appointed Wigan Athletic manager on Wednesday - less than three months after Sportsmail's Matt Lawton exclusively revealed the awful text messages and e-mails he had been exchanging with Cardiff City's former head of recruitment Iain Moody.

The texts and emails included messages of a racist, homophobic, sexist and anti-Semitic nature and are still the subject of an ongoing Football Association investigation.

Here, Sportsmail looks through a timeline of how the textgate saga unfolded.

'They (Mackay and Moody) didn’t do it for three whole months. So we were advised we had to or the FA could fine us.'
