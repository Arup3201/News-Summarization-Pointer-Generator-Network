It's the new reality TV show viewers just can't stop tweeting about - a live stream of birds and squirrels hanging out in a feeder that looks like a coffee shop.

The barmy show, named Piipshow, is the creation of photographer Magne Klann and model maker Lars Aurtrade, and is currently being produced by Norwegian broadcaster NRK.

The show is due to air until June 2014, with the best action usually taking place during daylight hours. Fans can watch live via NRK's website.

Ever changing clientele in the cafe include excitable birds as nuthatches, bullfinches and tits. Petty squirrels also pop by, trying their best to steal the birds' food.

Producers hope the show will educate viewers about wildlife in an entertaining way. If the first month is anything to go by, bickering, fighting and plenty of characters are guaranteed.

Some are even hoping for romance before the season is up.
