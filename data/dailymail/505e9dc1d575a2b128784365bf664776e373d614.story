A schoolboy detective has helped to snare minibus drivers using their mobile phones while taking children to school in a seven-seater vehicle.

Dylan Ewers, 14, used his phone to catch the two drivers on camera as they broke the law while on the school run.

His videos were used as evidence to convict John Phillips, 41, and Leslie Seswick, 40, who were both employed to drive children living in rural areas to school on the minibus.

Each landed a £500 fine and given three penalty points after Dylan became concerned that the drivers flouted the road rules, using their mobile phones while negotiating winding country roads in South Wales.

The footage was enough to convict the pair after school officials passed it on to police.

Dylan said that pupils were left scared on the school run to King Henry VIII Comprehensive in Abergavenny, claiming that the drivers mounted kerbs and one had even pulled out in front of a lorry, frightening the children on board.

Prosecutor Jean Munton told 
Abergavenny Magistrates’ Court in South Wales: ‘Dylan told his mother 
that some of the drivers concerned him by using their mobile phones 
while on the five-mile run to school.

‘He
filmed the drivers using his Blackberry on two successive days and the 
footage was downloaded to a lap top and burned onto disc.’

Enough to convict: The footage, which also caught Leslie Seswick using his phone while driving children living in rural areas to school, pictured, was filmed on the teenager's Blackberry

Dylan, of Clydach, near Abergavenny, said: ‘I knew that people didn’t believe me when I told them what was going on.

‘I felt the only way to prove it was to catch them at it by filming them on their mobiles.

‘I was pleased to capture them on film and glad it was used in court.’

Magistrates praised Dylan’s 
undercover work yesterday after viewing the two films. Monmouthshire 
Passenger Transport Unit, who hire the G & H Taxis from Brynmawr for
the service, also praised the pupil’s quick thinking.

Manager Richard Cope said: ‘We applaud Dylan for speaking out and completely understand why he would feel uncomfortable.

‘Well done to him for bringing the situation to our attention.

‘We are confident the operator has taken quick and effective steps to deal with the situation.’

Dylan’s mother Sadie, 38, said: ‘He knew he had to get the evidence and managed to do it.’

Phillips, of Ebbw Vale, and Seswick, of Abergavenny did not attend court but were convicted in their absence.

Their conviction comes just weeks after a newly-wed mechanic was killed after taking his eyes off the road to send a text message to his wife before swerving into the path of an oncoming truck.

Darren Green, 35, was driving over the speed limit and failed to slow down as he replied to a text from his wife of eight months, Angela.

The inquest at Westminster Coroners Court heard that Mr Green was driving more than 10mph over the speed limit in London Road, Mitcham, south London, shortly before the crash and was not wearing a seatbelt at the time.
