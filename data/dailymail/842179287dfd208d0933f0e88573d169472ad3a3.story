A globetrotting musician from Barcelona has gone all out in recreating German composer J. S. Bach's first Cello Suite.

Singing 658 notes over 329 days in more than 25 cities across the world, Publio Delgado has managed to achieve his very own work of art.

The 30-year-old, who performed at concerts around the globe to fund his travels, remained disciplined in his filming. 

The result is this unique video travel log with a highly impressive soundtrack indeed.

Explaining why he chose Bach's Cello Suite No.1, he tells MailOnline:

'I needed a piece composed only by a melody, without harmony, so I could just sing it by myself without having to depend on including other people for other possible voices.

'This was perfect for it, not only because it met that requirement, but also because it's a beautiful and world wide well known piece.' 

A NOTEworthy performance: Publio Delgado from Barcelona managed to perform Bach's cello suite No.1 by singing two chords a day during his time abroad

Each day, for just under a year, Publio found the time to sing two pitches in order to imitate this classical music extravaganza almost to perfection, despite having a very active social life.

One moment he's busy exploring a range of stunning landscapes across Japan and the next he is chilling on the beach back in Spain, using the subway in NYC, or playing in the snow in Boston.

But, as filming spans such a long period of time, he is often seen completing mundane tasks too such as bathing, hanging up laundry or even lying down for a nap.  

In the footage, you are immediately thrown into the traveller's exciting world as he spends time with close friends, near and far.

If only for a brief moment, it is fantastic to see all the different backdrops that make up nearly a year of his care-free life.

However, Publio admits that he faced some technical difficulties while piecing the project together.

One month before he finished, his editing software crashed and he lost all his hard work.

But luckily he had been keeping the videos in two different hard-drives, just in case something like that happened, and he began reediting it from the beginning.

'I wanted to shoot the video in the most beautiful possible landscapes,' he adds.

'For example, in Japanese island Hachijojima I climbed up a mountain for three hours just to get a good shot of the island, and then I got lost on my way back and it took me other 3-4 hours to get back to the village. 

Now he's here, now he's there: Publio visits Spain, Japan and New York during 11 months of travel

'Some other days, right before sleeping I just realised I hadn't recorded anything that day so I just did whatever.' 

During his time travelling, Publio says he did not have a specific route and booked tickets to different places on 'impulse', especially when he found a good deal and could afford it. 

'Every city/village/culture I visited has their own thing going on; their own strengths, their own weaknesses, and instead of deciding which one is the best, I'd rather just try to get influenced by the best of each place.' 

Disciplined: Not a day passes that the golden voiced globetrotter missed a note 

Upon his return, is there anywhere where is desperate to travel to again?

He says: 'I always repeat destinations and I try to travel places when they have their best weather. 

'I like to go up north in Europe on summer, Asia in fall and spring and the south of Spain in winter. 

'There's still a lot of places I haven't been, I never visited the south hemisphere, and either Africa, South America or Oceania are continents where I really really want to go.

And what advice would he give to anyone traveling around the world? 

'Instead of visiting the tallest tower, the oldest temple, the biggest shopping mall, why not just try to live a daily life with local people, blend with their culture, eat where they eat, hang where they hang, and eventually become one more of them?' 

'I wanted to shoot in the most beautiful possible landscapes' - Publio mixed stunning scenery with the breathtaking classical piece to create a very special art work of his own
