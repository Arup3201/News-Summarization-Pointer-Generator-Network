A two-year-old boy never woke from his routine afternoon nap after being struck down by a mysterious virus, an inquest heard.

Fit and healthy Elliot Kerslake is thought to have had a seizure from swelling of his brain as he suffered from an everyday cold.

Hours earlier, Elliot had been showing off a dance routine for his sister's friends and cheering on his big brother Oliver, 12, at a football match.

Elliot Kerslake, two, from Leeds, died in his sleep from a swelling to his brain caused by a mystery virus. Doctors have said there is 'nothing that could have saved him'

His parents John and Andrea Kerslake wept as a coroner heard their written evidence about his sudden death on March 3, 2013.

Mrs Kerslake, 45, said Elliot had been put down for his post-lunch nap at 2pm, and his sister found him dead three hours later.

She told the coroner: 'I read him a Fireman Sam story as I put him down for an afternoon nap at 2pm just after his lunch.

'I told him I loved him and closed the curtains. Around that time John came home. I had left the door open and thirty minutes later I went back to check on him.

'He was lying on his tummy and making a little sobbing noise. I didn't think much of it as my two other children used to do the same when they were younger.

'I went in and said to him 'do you want to come down, sweetheart?', but he didn't answer.'

Mrs Kerslake said she was gardening as her husband watched football on TV when their daughter Emily, now 14, screamed.

They found Elliot lying 'blue and floppy' and called an ambulance to their home in Shadwell, Leeds.

An operator told John how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Mr Kerslake said: 'I continued fighting for him shouting "come on Elliot, you can do it", although I started to feel in my mind that he was gone.'

Encephalitis is an uncommon but serious condition that causes inflammation of the brain.

Encephalitis usually begins with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, a headache and joint pain.

More serious symptoms may then develop over the next few hours or days, including:

 Flu-like symptoms that rapidly get worse and affect mental state should be treated as a medical emergency. In these circumstances, dial 999 immediately and request an ambulance.

The parents accompanied their son in the ambulance but he was pronounced dead at Leeds General Infirmary.

Leeds Coroners Court heard how the energetic youngster had been playing in the garden and entertaining his sister's friends who had been on a sleepover hours before his death.

Mrs Kerslake said: 'Because of the other children staying, Elliot was in our bed the night before. 

'We had read bedtime stories and in the morning we had a big hug.

'We chatted about what we would do that day and I dressed him in his blue dungarees with patterned socks, so I could grab hold of him if he ran off.

'He was so excited that morning and did a little dance for his sister's friends.

'We went to Starbucks to get a coffee and he ate normally. Then later we went to see his older brother Oliver play in a football match.

'I had to wipe his runny nose quite a bit that day, but didn't think much of it.

'My husband met us at the football field at lunchtime and I remember Elliot shouting "that's my daddy" and ran over to him to give him a cuddle.'

She added that they left to go home for lunch, where Elliot was put down for the nap from which he never woke up.

Dr Richard Newton, a specialist in child neurology at Manchester Royal Infirmary, said the cause of Elliot's death was most likely encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - caused by a virus which triggered a seizure as he slept.

He said: 'This was a well little boy with a cold, essentially. He went down in the afternoon for a nap which is a routine almost every family in Britain bears witness to.

'I would suggest the cause of Elliot's death to be a seizure during his nap related to encephalitis, caused by an indeterminable virus.

'There are thousands, if not millions of types of virus and it would be impossible to determine which kind.'

Hours before his death, Elliot had been in a good mood. He woke up to a hug with mother Andrea, 45 (right), performed a dance for his sister Emily (left)

Dr Newton added there was 'nothing that could have saved Elliot'.

He said: 'The events that afternoon were common events in every household.

'He ate his lunch, had his nap and must have died within that time.

'It's part of nature's rare unkindness.'

Coroner David Hinchliff said the cause of death was, on the balance of probabilities, 'inflammation of the brain caused by an indeterminable viral infection'.

He recorded a verdict of natural causes. 

Speaking before the hearing, Mr Kerslake said: 'Elliot loved life, he relished every new experience. He gave so much love to us, his brother and sister and all that knew him.

'It's comforting to know that his short life will impact positively on others during the months and years to come.'
