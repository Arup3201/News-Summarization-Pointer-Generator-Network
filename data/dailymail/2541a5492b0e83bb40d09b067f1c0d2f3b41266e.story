Another victim falls for a Twitter hoax with New Zealand MP Peter Dunne unknowingly retweeting a photo of British serial killer Harold Shipman.

The troll struck just 24 hours after Donald Trump was tricked into retweeting a photo of British serial killers Fred and Rose West which enraged the tycoon who retorted suggesting that he may sue over the prank.

Mr Dunne replied just as disapprovingly after he had retweeted a post: 'My Dad, Hal was a huge supported buy passed away before he could vote for you. Please RT in his memory' alongside a photo of the notorious killer who murdered up to 250 people in England between the 1970s and 1990s.

The hoax that fooled New Zealand MP Peter Dunne to retweet the photo of serial killer Harold Shipman

It is pointed out to Mr Dunne that the picture is in fact of a deceased notorious serial killer

The United Future political party leader expresses that he is far from impressed by the prank

Mr Dunne was led to believe that Shipman was a supporter of his who died before being able to vote for him

Once a Twitter user pointed out that Shipman had killed 200 people, Mr Dunne accidentally replied to the wrong person, instead of the prankster, calling him a 'humourless cow', Buzzfeed reported.

It was then that who appeared to be the real troll stepped forward and tried to smooth over the online jape.

'You're a good man and a good sport; I've just go to keep politician's on their toes. All the best for your next term.' the cheeky culprit posted.

The embarrassing gaff included pretending that Shipman was a supporter of the MP - although the man hung himself in his cell at Wakefield Prison in West Yorkshire the day before his 58th birthday in January 2004 after being jailed for life for murdering up to 250 people but was only charged for 15 of the cases.

While Mr Trump's hoax involved pretending that the West couple deemed the American business magnate as an inspiration.

The infamous pair tortured and raped numerous young women and girls and murdered at least 11 of them - including their own family members.

Mr Trump deleted the post about 40 minutes later then called the troll a 'jerk' and said he would consider suing the culprit for the prank

'I thought was being kind to somebody re their parents. I guess this teaches you to not to be nice or trusting. Sad.' he posted.
