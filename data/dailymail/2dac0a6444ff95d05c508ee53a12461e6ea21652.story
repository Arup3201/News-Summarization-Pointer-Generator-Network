Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush already has so much capaign cash in a super PAC that supports him has reportedly asked his biggest donors to limit themselves to giving $1 million each.

At least during the current fundraising quarter that ends March 31.

Insiders told The Washington Post that Bush is telling his super-wealthy supporters to put a cap for the moment on the high-dollar checks they write to his Right to Rise super PAC.

Super PACs can collect unlimited money from individuals and corporations, and spend it to support candidates, as long as there's no 'coordination' with their campaigns when the spending happens.

Bush reportedly met with a group of powerful financiers in New York in the final days before he decided to launch the PAC.

SLOW DOWN: Jeb Bush's inner circle is reportedly telling high-dollar donors to set a $1 million cap on their donations during the first 2015 fundraising quarter

RETAIL CAMPAIGNING: Bush is trying to do his share of meet-and-greet events with ordinary people, like this group he addressed Monday in Las Vegas, so Americans don't think of him as another Mitt Romney

Bush advisers, the Post reported, are becoing concerned that the former Florida governor mgiht get a reputation as a tool of big business and the rich, and want instead to stress his independence and ties to far more small-dollar contributors.

The perception that 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was a detached, wealthy candidate who identified most with America's '1 per cent' was among the factors leading to his defeat.

The PAC's first campaign finance report is due to the Federal Election Commission on April 15, and the story it tells may determine whether Bush's expected candidacy is plagued with similar accusations.

Bush is expected to turn in a report showing tens of millions of dollars collected. Almost no one else in the potential Republican field is thought to have the capacity to match his fundraising juggernaut.

New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump is one exception. His own wealth could fund a super PAC independently, but a Trump aide has told Daily Mail Online that he would embrace a retail campaigning strategy as well. 

'This campaign is about much more than money,” GOP fundraiser Howard Leach told the Post. 'They need substantial funds, but they don’t want the focus to be on money.'

Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and declined to offer a statement to the Post.

The Post noted that some of the $1 million donors are likely to becoe repeat contributors once Bush's campaign is formally launched.

Big names Bush has visited on fundraising swings include Las Vegas casino legend Steve Wynn. He's in the middle of an aggressive national criss-cross designed to bulk up his campaign cofferd in what his aides have described as a 'shock and awe' campaign.

Its success could discourage others with less access to big money from running against him.

MONEY TROUBLE: FOrmer House Speaker Newt Gingrich, seen las tmonth at the COnservative Political Action Conference, was criticized in 2012 for taking $15 million for his super PAC from a casino magnate

SUPER PAC: Bush's political action committee can raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals and corporations 

Romney's super PAC raised $12 million in the first fundraising period after it was launched during the last election cycle. Bush's effort could dwarf that.

But casino money has gotten at least one Republican presidential candidate in trouble before.

In 2012 former House Speaker Newt Gingrich got a public black eye because of a $15 million cash infusion from gambling titan Sheldon Adelson. 

In that same year, the Post notes, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum benefited from large donations made by investor Foster Friess.

Santorum is expected to run again in 2016. 

The Bush circle's caution to their richest contacts 'shows they are disciplined and appreciate that the dominance of a few key people early on is not a productive thing for the campaign or for Jeb Bush,' Republcian fundraiser Rick Hohlt told the Post.
