A teenager was killed by stepping in front of a train just minutes after being told his grades weren't good enough to stay at sixth form college, an inquest has heard.

Michael Platt, 18, had been studying in the first year of sixth form at Ifield Community College in Ifield, West Sussex, and had left the school just ten minutes before he was struck by a train and killed. 

An inquest at Horsham Coroners' Court heard he had been told he had not achieved the grades to enable him to return for a second year, and was advised to go to Central Sussex College's Crawley campus to see if he could join a course there.

Student Michael Platt, 18, walked in front of a train at Horsham station, West Sussex, after finding out he did not have the grades to progress into the second year of college, an inquest has heard

Instead, in a state of 'turmoil', he jumped over the level crossing where he was struck by a train and killed.

Michael from Gossops Green, East Sussex, was a member of the college choir and had planned to go to university to study child psychology.

Mother Jane spoke at the inquest, and told the coroner her son 'was the life and soul of the party', Crawley News reports. 

She said her son was her best friend, and added: 'The only time he told me anything, looking back, in hindsight, was he thought the world wasn't a nice place and he had an issue with the way society is.

'All he said was "what is the point? We struggle; we work hard for nothing at the end of it".

'I said "you leave a legacy". But to him the world was an ugly place.'

The 18-year-old had been studying in the first year of sixth form at Ifield Community College in Ifield, West Sussex, and had left the school just ten minutes before he was struck by a train and killed

Inspector Gary Ancell said. 'As the train driver approached the level crossing he said he saw people on either side of the closed gates.

'As he got nearer he saw a young male jump over the barrier and stand in the middle of the railway track, immediately in front of his train.

'There was nothing the train driver could do and he could not stop in time.'

Coroner Dr David Skipp said as there was no note left behind, or a phone call from Mr Platt to loved ones, he did not believe the teenager had meant to take his own life.

He recorded an open verdict, and added: 'I expect he was in turmoil when he left the school.

'Whatever was going through his mind, he took absolutely drastic measures, measures which I think he hadn't considered the effects of, and who would be hurt by what he did.'
