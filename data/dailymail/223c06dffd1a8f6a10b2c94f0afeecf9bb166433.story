Borussia Dortmund's general manager Hans-Joachim Watzke is optimistic Marco Reus will still be at the club next season.

Reus is the focus of interest from Bayern Munich and reportedly from clubs in England and Spain, with a clause in his contract permitting him to leave for a set fee at the end of the current campaign.

Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge claimed several months ago that he knows the value of that clause to be £19.9 million.

However, suitors would need to convince the 25-year-old to leave his home region of Westphalia.

'I believe that fundamentally Marco would love to stay here because he loves the city and he loves Borussia Dortmund,' Watzke told Stern magazine.

'But I'm sure the people who are interested in him moving will provide him with other arguments.'

Dortmund have seen Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski move to Bayern in the past two years and are eager to avoid losing another star player to their bitter rivals.

If Reus were to leave, he would not be sold for financial reasons, Watzke has suggested.

'We're aiming to build revenue to around 300 million euros by 2017/18, but that excludes transfers,' he added.

'That would mean we would be able to invest an additional 20 million in the team than we can now.'
