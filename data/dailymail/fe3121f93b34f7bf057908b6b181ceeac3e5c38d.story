Sunderland defender Wes Brown will be tackling questions during an appearance on All Star Family Fortunes to raise money for charity.

The former Manchester United star will take part with his family on the popular ITV game show in a bid to raise funds for the Beechwood cancer charity's Silver Wing Appeal.

The programme has not been aired yet, but Brown's wife Leanne offered a sneak preview after posting an Instagram picture of the family accompanied by the caption: 'Looking forward to this week's family fortunes! It's the Browns vs the Halpenny's'.

Brown and his family have been pitted against actress Jill Halfpenny and her loved ones on the Sunday night show hosted by Vernon Kay.

Brown's wife Leanne, who also appears in Real Housewives of Cheshire, told the Manchester Evening News: 'It was a great experience – I just wish we could have won more.'

The family chose the Beechwood charity as Brown's uncle is currently battling cancer and his wife and grandaughter have been using the charity's support services.

'Natasha, Wes's sister came into Beechwood and really enjoyed having a look at what we do, a really lovely family.'

Sunderland face Aston Villa on Saturday with Brown eligible to play after having his red card against United rescinded when referee Roger East appeared to send the wrong player off.
