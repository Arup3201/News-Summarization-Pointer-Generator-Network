A paedophile who sent vile sexual messages to a 14-year-old girl arrived at court driving his mobility scooter wearing a cape, balaclava and sunglasses in a bizarre attempt to hide his identity.

Police raided the home of Alan Bray after the teenager's parents reported his behaviour on Facebook and illegal child porn images were then found on his computer.

The 41-year-old, who told his victim he would leave his wife for her, turned up at Leeds Crown Court yesterday and wore the strange outfit to avoid photographers.

Bray, who lives in the city, was made the subject of a three-year supervision order and told to take part in a sex offenders' treatment programme after admitting sex offences.

He has pleaded guilty to inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and 10 of making indecent photographs of a child. He was also told to sign the sex offenders' register for five years.

Bray's offending came to light in March last year when the victim's parents caught her using her computer late at night. They were shocked to discover the content of her Facebook messages from him.

Over a 12-week period he made repeated sexually explicit requests, such as asking her for 'naked facetime'.

Bray made arrangements to speak to the youngster online when his wife went out. He also told her he loved her and she could live with him.

A total of 10 images were discovered on his computer. One was a movie at level five - the most serious kind - of a 14-year-old girl being raped.

Kama Melly, for Bray, told the court her client was wheelchair-bound as a result of an arthritis condition. She said the offences stemmed from him being unable to have sex. He began viewing pornography on the internet but his behaviour escalated.

Judge Tom Bayliss, QC, said: 'Her parents' vigilance, only her parents' vigilance, ended this.'
