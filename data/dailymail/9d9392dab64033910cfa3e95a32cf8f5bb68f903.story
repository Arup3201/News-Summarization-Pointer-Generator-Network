Scaling the 3,000ft sheer granite face of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park without bolts or climbing tools had been dubbed the 'climb of the century' for good reason - but on Wednesday afternoon two daredevils did it.

Tommy Caldwell, 36, and Kevin Jorgeson, 30, spent two and a half grueling weeks scaling El Capitan's so-called Dawn Wall in a feat some had deemed impossible, their hands left bleeding and torn as they inched their way up.

After 19 days, the two men even gave a fist bump to Yosemite as they neared the top of their climb  - and celebrated with a hug once they'd hauled themselves to the summit.

A tweet on Jorgeson's account on Wednesday read: 'It's not over till it's over. #DawnWall'.

The climbers celebrate privately with their families at the summit - both men having emotional reunions with their anxious partners.

The Dawn Wall of El Capitan is divided into 32 climbing
pitches, which are varying lengths of rock that the climbers mastered using only their hands and feet. 

The wall has
been scaled before, first by legendary climber Warren Harding in
1970, but never before without climbing tools.

Caldwell and Jorgeson had reached the final 11 pitches on
Tuesday after working their way past some of the toughest
stretches on the rock.

Jorgeson struggled for several days last week on difficult
pitch 15, at one point being forced to rest for two days while
the skin on his fingers healed after being ripped off by
razor-sharp ledges.

The two climbers used safety ropes in case of falls,
and were using ropes and other tools to move back and forth from
their campsite perched high on the rock.

Because the warmth of the day can cause their hands and feet
to perspire, the two often started climbing at dusk.

Caldwell and Jorgeson's attempt on El Capitan had been
closely watched in the climbing world and drew worldwide attention as they made
progress toward the summit.

According to Brandwatch, a social listening and analytics
firm, social media mentions of the climb have skyrocketed since
the climb began, drawing more than 17,000 mentions as of
Wednesday.

El Capitan rises more than 3,000 feet above the Yosemite Valley floor. The first climber reached its summit in 1958, and there are roughly 100 routes up to the top

Several dozen people, including relatives of the climbers, and about two dozen photographers, were gathered in the meadow looking up at the face, which is called the Dawn Wall.  

'I feel like the most proud person in the world right now,' said Caldwell's 39-year-old sister Sandy Van Nieuwenhuyzen. 

Ms Van Nieuwenhuyzen, of Rochester, Minnesota, said she can't wait to hug her younger brother. 

'I'm just going to hug. Just hug. No words necessary,' she said. 'It's such a big moment that a congratulatory hug is going to be very soothing to my big sister soul.'

The pair started climbing on December 27 using the free-climbing technique that shuns climbing aids other than harnesses and ropes to prevent deadly falls.

The world has been watching the pair's grueling half-mile journey up the peak's Dawn Wall route. 

But Clayton says the men won't give media interviews at the top. They plan to discuss the climb on Thursday.

Throughout the climb, both men needed to take rest days to allow their skin to heal. They used tape and even superglue to help with the process.

At one point, Caldwell set an alarm to wake him every four hours to apply a special lotion to his throbbing hands.

They also took physical punishment when their grip would slip, pitching them into long, swinging falls that left them bouncing off the rock face. The tumbles, which they called 'taking a whipper,' ended in startling jolts from their safety ropes.

Eric Jorgeson, Kevin Jorgeson's father, told KGO-TV that his son has always been a climber and watching him fulfill a long-time dream made  him proud.

'He climbed everything he could think of. It made us nervous early on as parents, but we got used to it,' the father said. 

'It was more other parents saying, ''Hey, your son is at the top of a backstop.'''

The two started climbing El Capitan (there are more than 100 routes to the top) when Kevin Jorgeson turned 15, and it has been a birthday tradition ever since.

Becca Caldwell, who is married to Tommy Caldwell, was on the ground with their toddler son and had been blogging about her excitement as she prepared to reunite with her husband.
