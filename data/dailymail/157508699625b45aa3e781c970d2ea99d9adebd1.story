Have you ever ditched your shopping basket in Primark because you can't face the queue for the changing rooms?

Or maybe you've avoided picking up some post-jog supermarket essentials because you can't face heading round the store in sweaty clothing. 

Well help is now on the way, thanks to the invention of a new maxi dress that means you can get changed while in a busy public place, without anyone catching a glimpse of what lies underneath.

The 'Undress' maxi dress was designed by two Californians for women on-the-go. It means ladies can switch outfits in public without flashing any skin

The creation, called the Undress, looks like a long dress with a halter top and long skirt, but comes packed with extras including pockets, drawstrings and the ability to shorten the skirt and reverse the design.

The design means the days of changing behind a precariously-placed beach towel or in the backseat of a car are over.

The Undress is the brainchild of entrepreneurs Dennis Caco and April Estrada, who organise sports events for charity in their home city of San Diego.

The Undress is expected to cost $75 (£45) when it goes on sale later this year.

Mrs Estrada said: 'I love the fact that The Undress gives women like me the freedom to change anywhere they want to.

'When I took up running for the first time last year, I was shocked by how difficult and uncomfortable it was to change out of my clothes, especially my sports bra, immediately after a run.'

The Undress is designed for busy women who often need to get changed out of outfits while heading from one activity to another

She continued: 'It's hard for women to find a discrete place to change out in public but it's awesome that it'll no longer be a problem with The Undress.

'For runners, swimmers, surfers, cross-trainers, mums, travellers and other women with several places to be in one day, it often leaves little time and means to change outfits.

'As an innovative apparel invention, The Undress is designed with two side access openings, a slip-under front panel, drawstring, front inner lining, and other special features that make the transition of changing without being exposed possible.

'The Undress makes living an active lifestyle more convenient than ever.'

The 'Undress' comes in a range of colours and will go on sale later this year priced at $75 (£45)

Mr Caco added: 'Working in active sports myself, I've seen that one of the hardest things for women about working out isn't the workout itself - it's changing out of their sweaty clothes afterwards.

'Even as a guy I see and feel the discomfort that women have to go through when they try to sneak in their cars to change or try to inconspicuously change under a towel.

'But now, women no longer have to take the risk of bearing it all. 

'There's a solution for them and it's called The Undress.'
