Those anticipating the Premier League return got just what they wanted - last-minute winners, red cards, the odd mistake and, of course, stand-out performances.

A new season is upon us, and what better way to impress than to top the statistical table?

Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the top 10  Premier League performers from the weekend. Raheem Sterling, Aaron Ramsey and David Silva all make the list, but who comes out on top in our Player Performance Index PPI chart?

10. Sebastian Larsson, Sunderland (PPI score: 33.6)

Last year, Sunderland finished five points above the relegation zone. Every point counts in the harsh climate of the Premier League and Larsson, boasting an 83.3 per cent pass completion rate, spared the Black Cats' opening-day blushes with an 85th-minute goal to earn a draw against West Brom.

The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League.

It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices?

1. Winning Performance

2. Player's Performance per match

3. Appearances

4. Goals scored

5. Assists

6. Clean sheets

9. Tom Ince, Hull City (34.4)

Hull welcomed Queens Park Rangers back to the Premier League by stripping them of any points at Loftus Road, and Ince was as big a part of that away win as anyone. 

The 22-year-old left the capital having kept a 95.8 per cent pass completion rate throughout, and showed Inter Milan what they missed out on.

8. Eric Dier, Tottenham Hotspur (35.7)

Scoring a last-minute winner in a London derby on your debut in the first game of the Premier League season says it all.

On Saturday, a 20-year-old by the name of Eric Dier did just that. 

The former Sporting centre-back emerged from Upton Park with an 88.4 per cent pass completion rate, too. 

No 9: Hull City's Tom Ince made QPR taste defeat on the opening day with a 95.8 per cent pass completion rate

No 8: Tottenham Hotspur's Eric Dier scored a last-minute winner in the London derby against West Ham

7. Laurent Koscielny, Arsenal (37.5)

The only team to win at home on Saturday, Arsenal can thank Koscielny for making that happen against a manager-less Crystal Palace in the aftermath of losing Tony Pulis.

With the equalising goal, six clearances and four interceptions, the 28-year-old centre-back was a rock in the heart of the defence, and earned his three points at the Emirates.

No 7: Arsenal's Laurent Koscielny used his head to help them be the only team to win at home on Saturday

Well done: Koscielny got the equaliser, made six clearances and four interceptions against Crystal Palace

Earned: Arsenal started the Premier League season with three points at the Emirates over Palace

6. Aaron Ramsey, Arsenal (39.8)

The clock struck 90 but Ramsey didn't care. The 23-year-old was in the right place at the right time to earn Arsenal three points in the dying moments, just as a broken Palace side thought they'd earned a share of the spoils in north London.

The Wales international added 65 passes in the opposition half, completed 92 overall, and boasted an 86.8 per cent completion rate for good measure.

5. David Silva, Manchester City (39.9)

It all went according to plan for City. No slip ups, no surprises. 

Silva, as per usual, was among those making life uncomfortable for Newcastle, scoring once and making 51 passes in the opposition half with a tidy 88.2 per cent pass completion rate. It was as if the 28-year-old had never been away.

No 5: David Silva of Manchester City ensured Newcastle United did not cause an upset at St James' Park

Surrounded: Silva scores the opening goal on Sunday as City ran out 2-0 winners in the Premier League

Up there: Silva made life uncomfortable, making 51 passes in the opposition half with a tidy 88.2 per cent rate

4. James Chester, Hull City (42.8)

Chester, showing the strength needed in the Premier League, shrugged off Rio Ferdinand, QPR's export from Manchester United, and nabbed the goal that won the game.

The centre-back didn't forget his duties at the back either, making 14 clearances and three blocks.  

No 4: James Chester helped Hull City beat QPR at Loftus Road and was equally solid in defence as well

3. Gylfi Sigurdsson, Swansea City (47.5)

Swansea failed to read the script when they beat Manchester United 2-1 at Old Trafford on Saturday - not that they cared. 

It was Sigurdsson who ultimately spoiled the Louis van Gaal party, restoring the Welsh club's advantage with less than 20 minutes remaining. An all-round performance saw the 24-year-old score, provide the assist for Sung-Yueng Ki's opener, and keep a pass completion rate of 76.2 per cent.

No 3: Gylfi Sigurdsson spoiled Louis van Gaal's party at Old Trafford on Saturday to earn Swansea a 2-1 win

Winner: Sigurdsson provided the assist for Sung-Yueng Ki's opener and kept a pass completion rate of 76.2

2. Saido Berahino, West Brom (50.4) 

West Brom's top goalscorer of last season got off the mark somewhat emphatically.

Two goals, five crosses delivered and an 82.1 per cent pass completion rate warranted more than the point he got in return against Sunderland. 

That's one way to tell manager Alan Irvine to put his name on the team-sheet first ahead of new £10million signing Brown Ideye. 

No 2: Saido Berahino was runner up for the Premier League's top 10 of the weekend as West Brom drew 2-2

1. Raheem Sterling, Liverpool (52.3) 

A performance that leads those on Merseyside to deem life after Luis Suarez is there after all has to be special, and Sterling delivered that reassurance at Anfield on Sunday.

A goal, an assist, an 81.8 pass completion rate and five successful dribbles compiled the misery on Southampton, who fell to a 2-1 defeat on their return without Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren and Luke Shaw.

No 1: Raheem Sterling proved there is life after Luis Suarez with an outstanding performance for Liverpool

Luis who? A goal, an assist, an 81.8 pass completion rate and five successful dribbles helped Liverpool win 2-1
