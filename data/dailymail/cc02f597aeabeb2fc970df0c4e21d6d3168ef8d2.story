Golfer Dustin Johnson and fiancee Paulina Gretzky, an aspiring actress and model, are having a baby.

Ms Gretzky, who's the 25-year-old daughter of hockey great Wayne Gretzky, posted a photo on Instagram late Tuesday with her hands cradling her belly. She wrote in the caption that she and Mr Johnson 'are so excited to finally share with you all our amazing news... we're having a baby!!' She did not mention when the baby is due.

The news comes at an interesting time for the couple: Mr Johnson, 30, is currently serving a six-month suspension from the PGA Tour for testing positive for cocaine, according to unnamed sources on Golf.com.
