President Barack Obama's claim that a gunman who last month killed four French Jews inside a kosher deli 'randomly' selected the location and his targets came under heavy scrutiny today at a White House briefing, with multiple reporters badgering the president's spokesman to admit a tie between the victims' religion and their murders.

In an interview with Vox published on Monday Obama said, 'It is entirely legitimate for the American people to be deeply concerned when you’ve got a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris.'

Today the White House Press Secretary argued that his boss merely meant to say they 'were not specifically targeted' and 'were individuals who happened to randomly be in this deli.'

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest found himself in several testy back and forths with reporters this afternoon over the president's claim that victims of a kosher deli shooting in Paris were 'randomly' targeted

The shooter, Amedy Coulibaly, told French television station BFM-TV in a newly released interview that he picked kosher grocery Porte de Vincennes because, according to the station , 'he was targeting Jews'

The shooter, Amedy Coulibaly, told French television station BFM-TV in a newly released interview that he picked kosher grocery Hyper Cacher because, according to the station, 'he was targeting Jews.'

A journalist with the station says he also explained 'why he did this: to defend oppressed Muslims...notably in Palestine.'

'He claimed to be part of the Islamic State [ISIS] very clearly,' BFM reporter Sarah-Lou Cohen said of the phone conversation with Coulibaly. 'He said he had instructions from the caliphate. And then another very important element, evidently, as we were saying in the afternoon, he established a link with the Kouachi brothers.'

Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, the brothers allegedly behind the attack on the Paris-based satirical publication Charlie Hebdo, were later killed in stand off with police, as was Couilbaly.

Coulibaly's ties to ISIS are documented by a propaganda video taped by his wife, possibly a co-conspirator in the grocery store siege, in which she calls for French Muslims to carry out additional acts of terror. 

The White House found itself in several testy back and forths with reporters this afternoon over Obama's statement - provided to Vox more than a week ago but released just yesterday.

First asked about Obama's remark by CNN's Jim Acosta, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest replied, 'I believe the point that the president was trying to make is that these individuals were not specifically targeted.'

He added: 'These were individuals who happened to randomly be in this deli and were shot while they were there. And that is the point that the president was making.'

Flabbergasted, ABC News' Jon Karl pressed Earnest to confirm that president believes the deli goers' Jewish heritage were related to the assault.

'It is clear from the terrorists and some of the writings they've put out afterward what their motivation was,' Obama's spokesman told him. 

'The adverb that the president chose was used to indicate that the individuals who were killed in that terrible, tragic incident were killed not because of who they were, but because of where they randomly happened to be.'

Not satisfied, Karl again pointed out that they were in a kosher deli when they were killed, moments later contending that even if they weren't personally targeted they were attacked because of their religion, to which Earnest told him 'there were people other than just Jews who were in that...deli.'

'Does he have any doubt...that deli was attacked because it was a kosher deli, it was not any random deli, it was a kosher deli,' Karl eventually shouted at Earnest, who interrupted him to say, 'no,' Obama does not doubt that.

Picking up where Karl left off, seconds later Fox News' White House Correspondent Ed Henry asked, why then, 'didn't the president acknowledge that? If he knows that, and it's obvious, why didn't he say that?'

'The president has acknowledged that on many occasions when he's had the opportunity to speak about this incident,' Earnest tersely told him  

'But he didn't there!' Henry noted before moving on to another topic.
