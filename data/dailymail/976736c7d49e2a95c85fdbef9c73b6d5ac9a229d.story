Lululemon is on the hunt for a new CEO.

The yoga clothing company that made 
headlines earlier this year for its see-through pants snafu said Monday 
that CEO Christine Day will step down as head of the company after a 
successor is named.

Day has held the CEO spot for more than five years.

CEO Christine Day: She insists her departure is entirely her decision and unrelated to the problem with the black luon, the fabric from which the transparent pants were made

Scandal: Lululemon CEO Christine Day is stepping down after a costly, offensive scandal in which her company failed to do what it does best: make workout pants that people feel comfortable in

Yoga clothing retailer Lululemon just reported earnings and although the numbers weren't bad the shares tanked after the CEO announced she will step down dipping to $72 a share from $82

Lululemon Athletica Inc. shares dropped nearly 14 percent in after-hours trading following the news.

The time is right to bring in a new 
CEO to drive the next phase of Lululemon's growth, Day said in a 
statement, given that the company has laid plans for the next five years
and crafted a vision for the next 10. Day will continue to lead the 
company while the board searches for a new CEO.

The Canadian company made the 
announcement as it reported a slight increase in its fiscal 
first-quarter profit on higher revenue.

Lululemon earned $47.3 million, or 32
cents per share, for the quarter that ended May 5. That's compared with
$46.6 million, or 32 cents per share, in the first quarter last year.

Costly: Lululemon pulled its Luon pants from stores over the weekend in March after the company determined that the pants' fabric was too sheer and revealing

Revenue increased 21 percent to $345.8 million from 285.7 million.

That beat market expectations for the
quarter. Analysts, on average, were anticipating earnings of 30 cents 
per share on revenue of $341.4 million, according to FactSet.

Its revenue from stores open at least
a year increased 7 percent. This is considered a key indicator of 
financial performance for retailers, because it strips away the impact 
of recently opened or closed locations.

Lululemon said the past quarter has 
been one of the most important in its history, as it coped with the 
fallout from pulling a line of its black yoga pants in March for being 
too sheer.

The company ended having to pull its Luon pants from 
stores over the weekend of March 16 and 17, after the company determined
that the pants' fabric was too sheer and revealing.

Career: Day has been the head of luxury yoga-wear maker Lululemon since 2008. Before that, she worked as an executive at Starbucks

At
the time, the company said on its website that it first began to 
understand the extent of the problem on March 11, as part of its weekly 
call with store managers, who voiced worries about sheerness.

The company blamed the see-through 
nature on a style change and production problems. It hired a new team to
oversee the making of the pants.

The company previously said it anticipated losing $57 million to $67 million because of the pants issue.

Dropping faster than their leggings: Shares fell nearly 14% in after-hours trading once the announcement had been made

Day said it was able to get the 
product back into stores within 90 days of having pulled it, all while 
keeping customers happy with the brand.

Lululemon's performance does not seem
to be hampered by the issue. The company forecast fiscal second-quarter
earnings between 33 and 35 cents per share on revenue between $340 
million and $345 million. Analysts, on average, were forecasting 
earnings of 33 cents per share, on revenue of $329.6 million.

For the full fiscal year, the company
said it expects to earn between $1.96 and $2.01 per share, on revenue 
between $1.65 billion to $1.66 billion.

Analysts were predicting earnings of $2 per share for the year on revenue of $1.65 billion.

Lululemon also said that it plans to 
delist its stock from the Toronto Stock Exchange on June 24, saying that
the minimal trading volume there didn't make it worth the cost of 
maintaining both that listing and its stock on the NASDAQ exchange. Its 
shares will continue to trade on the NASDAQ.

Shares of Lululemon fell $11.38 to 
$70.80 in after-hours trading as the management change overshadowed the 
otherwise strong quarter and forecasts.

The stock closed the regular session at $82.28, up about 8 percent since the start of the year.
