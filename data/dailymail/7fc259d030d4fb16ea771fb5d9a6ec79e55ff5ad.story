Celtic star Mikael Lustig has revealed his season is over.

The Swedish international defender hasn’t played since February after injuring an ankle.

He hoped to return to play a part for the Champions in their bid to win the Treble.

However, he’s been forced to concede he is unlikely to play any more part in Ronny Deila’s attempts to win Celtic the Premiership and Scottish Cup to add to his League Cup success.

It’s the latest frustration for Lustig in a long line of injury setbacks which have included hip, groin and thigh injuries.

He missed a large part of last season too after being forced to undergo hip surgery.

‘I have to put this season to one side,’ Lustig said. ‘I have been out for six weeks now and the foot is still swollen. I have a stretched ligament on the inside of my foot and bruised the bone on the outside.

‘It may take three months before I’m good again.

‘But I have to look on the positive side because I don’t require an operation.

‘We will see how long it takes, but it’s looks like the season is over.’

Injury-prone Lustig has managed just 36 starts for Celtic since signing from Rosenborg in 2012.
