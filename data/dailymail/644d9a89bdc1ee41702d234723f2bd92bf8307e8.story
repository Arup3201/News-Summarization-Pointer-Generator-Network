A powerful and graphic road safety commercial has been released in a bid to persuade drivers to slow down or face grave consequences.

The commercial, entitled ‘Mistakes’, was released by the NZ Transport Agency and features a driver pulling out in front of a speeding vehicle.

Time slows right down as the cars are about to collide, allowing both drivers get out of their vehicles in a bid to avoid the devastation.

Hesitation: The driver looks back at his son a split second before the impact from the speeding car

Impact: The son looks back at his father in the drivers seat as the car hits their vehicle

Devastating impact: The final frames of the video show a car smashing into another vehicle which is carrying a father and his young son

The man desperately asks the speeding driver to slow down and not crash into him.

‘Please,
 I’ve got my boy in the back’, he stutters as tears fill his eyes and 
the camera pans to a young child in the backseat of his car.

Realising
 his grave misjudgement, the speeding driver replies: ‘Maybe… if I was 
going a bit slower. I’m going too fast, I’m sorry’.

The first man, realising his and his son’s fate, puts his hands to his head in devastation and gets back in his car.

A split second later, time resumes and the speeding car violently ploughs into the man and his son’s vehicle. 

 

The commercial starts with the two men getting out of their cars, the father on the right, and the speeding driver on the left

'I've got my boy in the back': The father pleads with the speeding driver to slow down

Although the speeding man is apologetic, he knows he is driving too fast to be able to avoid crashing into the other man and his son

The commercial’s final shot implores drivers: ‘Other people make mistakes. Slow down.’

The advertisement – which is expected to run for two years – has gone viral, but New Zealand aren’t the first to use shock tactics to get their message across to road users.

A particularly graphic four-minute public service video – in which three girls are involved in a horrific crash after the driver gets distracted while texting - caused a stir in the United Kingdom in 2009.

Last year, as part of the UK Government’s THINK! campaign, an ad ran to show the dangers of drink driving.

In it, unsuspecting men washing their hands in a bathroom were shocked and terrified as a mannequin cracked through the other side of the mirror, causing ‘blood’ to drip down.

The commercial was done to simulate a pedestrian crashing into a car’s windscreen.

Powerful message: Frustrated, the man covers his head in his hands, knowing that the crash is unavoidable

Final shot: The poignant message of the commercial reads; 'Other people make mistakes. Slow down'
