I didn't actually think Chelsea wasted too much time. As a professional team you do use up some, but there have been much clearer, embarrassing examples down the years.

The only advice I was given about this was when refereeing in Europe. The worst offenders were Porto under You Know Who, and I was told that there is absolutely no point cautioning a player for timewasting.

Why? Because if you've allowed it to last that long, to become that blatant, then it's simply not worth it. You've not done your job properly in the first place.

Euro trend: Time-wasting is more prevalent in Europe - where one of Mourinho's previous teams Porto was especially guilty

You officiate these situations on gut feeling and experience. It's down to you - these things are all about game management. 

Time-wasting
 isn't something that really sticks in the memory for me. It isn't 
particularly bad in this country. But like everything else it will begin
 to come in more and more. We didn't used to dive as much, or go down at
 the slightest bit of contact.

There
 is a way to eradicate any threat of timewasting of course. The solution
 is to have an independent timekeeper. Players are always bothering 
referees about the clock and additional time, but that would be taken 
away with someone sat up in the stands.

Having
 30 minutes each half with the clock stopped when the ball is out of 
play is the way forward, but that's far too sensible to ever be 
implemented.
