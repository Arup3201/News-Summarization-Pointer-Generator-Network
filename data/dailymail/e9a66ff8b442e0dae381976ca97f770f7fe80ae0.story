Crackdown: International Development Secretary Justine Greening ordered an 'emergency audit' of her department's spending on consultants in September

The amount of British overseas aid money lavished on consultants jumped by 45 per cent in just one month – despite a high-profile ‘crackdown’ on the practice being launched at the same time.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening ordered an ‘emergency audit’ of her department’s use of consultants last September following a public outcry.

But figures reveal that spending on so-called ‘technical and advisory services’ jumped from £31.7million in September to £45.9million the next month.

A Whitehall task force has been set up to monitor spending at the Department for International Development, which is in line for a 30 per cent budget increase this year.

The Treasury is concerned about the department’s capacity to handle the vast increase without presiding over millions of pounds of waste.

Miss Greening is considering whether more of the consultants’ work could be done by civil servants.

She has also demanded to see any contract worth more than £1million. Previously officials could wave through contracts worth up to £40million without seeking ministerial consent.

The latest figures will also underline concerns about the decision to pour billions more into foreign aid, with the budget to rise from £8.65billion to £11.3billion this year.

Dfid sources last night insisted the department had already mapped out exactly how the influx of cash would be spent.

A source also stressed that the spending on consultants in October had already been in the pipeline before the crackdown was launched. Much of it is said to be a legacy of Labour’s profligate years in office, when spending on consultants soared to £1billion a year.

Official figures show how some firms are making millions from Britain’s aid budget.

The so-called ‘poverty barons’ include PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which was paid more than £4million in October alone, while Adam Smith International pocketed £5.8million.

Large payments also went to a number of major foreign consultancies, such as the US-based ABT Associates, which was paid £2.1million.

Tory MP Peter Bone said he was ‘appalled’ by the amount of money spent on consultants.

He said: ‘The public are told overseas aid goes on building water wells in Africa and other worthy projects. I think people will be shocked to learn so much of it is going into the pockets of large consultancy firms.

‘It does also raise further questions about the huge increase planned in overseas aid.’
