Leicester City were understandably giddy on Thursday night as the announcement that they’d landed Esteban Cambiasso grew ever closer.

The Foxes’ official Twitter page posted that they had some ‘transfer news coming up’ before later posting that they couldn’t wait to unveil the Argentine. Amusingly, they ended up breaking their self-imposed embargo of 10 o’clock. Hardly surprising, given the gravity of the signature they'd acquired.

Cambiasso signed on a free transfer and is the most decorated player to ever don a Leicester City shirt. Sportsmail looks back at some of the previous greats to have seen out twilight years in the Premier League.

Done deal: Former Inter Milan midfielder Esteban Cambiasso has signed a contract with Leicester City

Roberto Mancini to Leicester (on loan from Lazio in 2001)

The Italian’s playing stay in the Premier League was somewhat briefer – but no less controversial – than his managerial stint. Mancini turned out just a handful of times for the Foxes, wasn’t particularly fit and ended up taking the Fiorentina job during his loan spell at Filbert Street.

Youri Djorkaeff to Bolton (from Kaiserslautern in 2002)

There is an argument that the Frenchman’s real twilight was at Blackburn in 2004, but at 32 it felt as if Djorkaeff was just giving the Premier League a whirl with newly-promoted Bolton. It actually turned out to be a pretty profitable move – he scored 20 league goals.

Fernando Hierro to Bolton (from Al Rayyan in 2004)

The former Spain captain struggled at centre-half, particularly when Mathias Svensson terrorised him for Norwich in a 3-2 defeat at Carrow Road. In fairness to Hierro, his undoubted class in possession was there for all to see when sitting in front of the back four.

Jay-Jay Okocha to Bolton (from Paris Saint-Germain in 2002)

Four glorious years at the Reebok Stadium saw the Nigerian earn deserved cult status. Okocha was the heartbeat of that Bolton side to continuously defy the top flight odds – his crowning moment being a superb free-kick on the last day of the 2002/03 season against Middlesbrough to clinch safety.

Legends: Attilio Lombardo (left, Crystal Palace) and Jay-Jay Okocha (Bolton) made a real impact in England

Ivan Campo to Bolton (from Real Madrid in 2003)

Campo played more than 150 games for the Trotters in a five-year spell and is still chanted about by supporters six seasons after leaving. He remains close to the club – frequently tweeting about their fortunes.

Attilio Lombardo to Crystal Palace (from Juventus in 1997)

The Italy international did eventually end his career at Lazio and Sampdoria, but captured the imagination at Selhurst Park. A goal on debut against Everton set him on his way and Lombardo was even appointed caretaker manager for a spell.

Christophe Dugarry to Birmingham (from Bordeaux in 2003)

The maverick’s permanent deal didn’t go quite to plan, but the loan spell preceding that was hugely successful. Dugarry’s ability to serve as a lynchpin – scoring goals and exciting St Andrew’s – served as the stir Birmingham needed to finish 13th under Steve Bruce.

On the move: Alen Boksic rocked up at Middlesbrough after a spell up front for Italian giants Lazio

Alen Boksic to Middlesbrough (from Lazio in 2000)

Twenty-two league goals in 68 games was a decent return for the striker in a team trying to find their feet in the Premier League. Boksic’s execution was precise, his close control exquisite.

Tomas Brolin to Crystal Palace (from unattached in 1998 – previously at Leeds)

Even though he enjoyed a better time at Palace than he endured at Leeds, Brolin has long been regarded as one of the worst players to grace English football. Not too much healthier though - they released the Swede after just a season.

George Weah to Manchester City (from AC Milan in 2000)

Not exactly the goal machine he had one been, Weah epitomised Manchester City at the time: a little bit slow and lacking ideas. He found the net just once in the league and wasn’t best pleased with manager Joe Royle either.

Not the best of times: George Weah never got on at Manchester City after winning the FA Cup at Chelsea

Trouble in the east: Croatian striker Davor Suker never truly settled at West Ham United 

Making his name: Suker was brilliant at Real Madrid and won the golden boot at the World Cup in 1998

Paulo Futre to West Ham (from AC Milan in 1996)

A dazzling winger, Futre enjoyed the best of his career during a six-year stint at Atletico Madrid but failed to nail down a club to stay at and became something of a journeyman. Upton Park was no different, even though he had the capacity to excite.

Davor Suker to West Ham (from Arsenal in 2000)

Arsene Wenger landed Suker 12 months after the World Cup in France on the strength of his golden boot, but the Croat failed to live up to expectation it was a similar story at West Ham, too, and he left for 1860 Munich after a year.

Gaizka Mendieta to Middlesbrough (from Lazio in 2004)

The Spaniard – remarkably to some – still lives in the North East after a five-year love affair with Boro that, although laden with injuries, saw him become a hero.

Different worlds: Gaizka Mendieta settled in Middlesbrough but made his name with Valencia
