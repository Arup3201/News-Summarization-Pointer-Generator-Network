 

Chinese New Year celebrations will take place on February 19 this year. 

Of course, Manchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney probably already knows this, after learning about the festival while filming a promotional campaign at Wing's Chinese restaurant in Manchester.  

The 29-year-old posed with a dragon mascot in the venue's dining area and posted the picture on his official Facebook account, captioning the snap: 'Had a good day filming yesterday at my friend Wing's restaurant and learning about Chinese New Year.'

Wing's restaurant is known to be a popular haunt for Rooney, who held his birthday celebrations there last October, dining out with his family and Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart.

Manchester United find themselves currently fourth in the Premier League table with 44 points, following a disappointing 1-1 draw with eighth-placed West Ham at The Boleyn Ground. 

The Hammers had taken the lead through Cheikhou Kouyate's swivel and close-range stab, but The Red Devils' blushes were spared thanks to Daley Blind's late equaliser.

Rooney has found himself at the centre of some tactical controversy recently as fans and pundits alike have questioned United manager Louis van Gaal's decision to deploy the player, traditionally viewed as a striker, in midfield. 

Although The Red Devils do remain in the Champions League spots, concerns have been raised over how convincing that position is, especially given how extensively Van Gaal has been backed in the transfer market. 

High-profile signings such as Angel di Maria and on-loan striker Radamel Falcao have failed to hit the form their reputations suggest of them and United face stiff competition from Southampton, Tottenham and Liverpool in their bid to return to Europe's top club competition.
