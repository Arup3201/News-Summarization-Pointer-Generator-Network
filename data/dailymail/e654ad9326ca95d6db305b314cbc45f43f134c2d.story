Louise Clarke, one of the founding members of Top Of The Pops dance troupe Pan's People, has died at the age of 63.

Ms Clarke, who formed the group with Flick Colby, Babs Lord, Ruth Pearson, Dee Dee Wilde and Andi Rutherford in 1966, died from heart failure on Saturday after suffering poor health for two years.

She is the second member of the group to pass away following the death of Ms Colby at the age of 65 in May last year.

The dancer's son Tony, stepson Anthony, stepdaughter Helen and grandsons Paul and Hugo were at her side at Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk after she was admitted on Friday, her friend and publicist Philip Day said.

'She was a lovely, lovely lady, she was a real darling,' he said.

'Having represented Pan's People as their publicist for more than 40 years, this comes as a tremendous shock, especially as we only lost co-founder and choreographer Flick Colby in May of last year.'

Pan's People first appeared in 1968 and spent eight years as the resident dancers on the weekly music show.

Mr Day added: 'Of
all the clients I have had the good fortune to represent during all of 
those years, they were perhaps the most fun to work with, certainly the 
easiest to work with, were loyal to a fault and the very best at what 
they did.'

The dance troupe provided the visual entertainment when an artist could not appear on the BBC chart show and became a staple of 1960s and 1970s TOTP.

From 1968 to 1976, the girls became 
famous for their flirtatious moves and risqué outfits, provoking 
adulation and even moral outrage.

They last appeared on the programme in April 1976, dancing to Silver Star by The Four Seasons.

Ms Clarke was a teenager when she joined the group and she left the group in 1974 because she wanted to start a family.

She told the Mail last year: 'I was a teenager when I joined the group in 1967, and the others were 
always protective of me. I loved being on stage. I never got nervous. 
And I was quite confident about baring my body — we had great figures in
those days.

'I left in 1974 because I was in love and wanted to start a family. I met
my husband Tony on the night of my 21st birthday. He wasn’t jealous of 
the attention I got from other men, but he was nervous I would meet 
someone else. I constantly reassured him that he was the only one for 
me.

'My relationship with the girls has never faded. We have always been there for each other, through good times and bad. Last year was a terrible one as I lost my husband. The girls were there for me completely. It helps to have friends who have shared so much.

'You can’t buy an experience like Pan’s People, or friendships like this.'

She was widowed in 2010 when her entrepreneur husband Tony died at 77.
