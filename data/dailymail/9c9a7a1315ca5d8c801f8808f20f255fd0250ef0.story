At least one in every 20 prisoners is from the gipsy, Romany or traveller communities, a report reveals.

With 4,276 prisoners in England and Wales being from these groups, they total 5 per cent of the jail population.

It means there are as many gipsies, Romany and travellers in our jails as there are women.

The report, entitled 'People in Prison: Gypsies, Romany and Travellers' 
was commissioned to help understand the experiences of particular groups
 in the prison system

The figures are higher among youth 
offenders. Around 12 per cent of all inmates aged 12 to 18 in prisons 
known as Secure Training Centres are gipsies, Romany or travellers.

The
 study, by HM Prisons Inspectorate, concluded that people from these 
backgrounds are ‘significantly over-represented in prison’.

It
 called for ‘comprehensive monitoring’ of the number of prisoners from 
the groups to understand why so many are behind bars. ‘The reasons for 
this over-representation lie outside the prison service and more needs 
to be done to understand and address this,’ the report said. The HM 
Prisons Inspectorate added that its prediction of total numbers is 
likely to be an underestimate.

The report was commissioned to help understand the experiences of particular groups in the prison system.

It
 finds that many from the three groups have a ‘mistrust’ of the police 
and the justice system, because they think it is designed to help 
‘permanently settled communities’.

Around five per cent of prisoners identified themselves as Gypsy, Romany or Traveller in the national prison survey. There are around 85,000 inmates in England and Wales, giving an estimated total of 4,276 behind bars

They
 cite evidence that gipsy offenders are more likely to be given a prison
 sentence and be remanded in custody because they do not have a 
permanent address and because of fears that they may abscond.

The
 2011 census included 58,000 people who identified themselves as gipsy 
or traveller. However, it did not survey for Romany and the census has 
struggled to track travellers.

In
 April 2012, the Mail reported on a gang of gipsy pickpockets, the 
Rostas family, who stole from at least 185 commuters on late night 
trains leaving London and used the cash to build five mansions in 
Romania.

There are around 85,000 inmates in England and Wales. The population of women prisoners is nearly 4,000.

In the report, prisoners were asked to identify themselves as gipsy, Romany or traveller.

The
 report says the word gipsy refers to Romany groups from Europe who 
settled in England in medieval times and lived nomadic lives. Romany or 
Roma speak the Romani language or did so in the past, while traveller 
refers to communities including Scottish, Welsh and Irish travellers who
 live nomadically.

The definition includes ‘occupational travellers’ such as ‘showpeople’ and ‘new travellers’.

HMP
 Woodhill was praised in the report for celebrating ‘Gipsy and Traveller
 Month’ and giving more telephone credit to gipsy prisoners to help pay 
for phone calls to their families.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We are committed to ensuring fair and equal treatment for all prisoners.

‘As
 part of this, we recently launched a campaign to encourage and support 
gipsy, traveller and Roma prisoners to declare their heritage and 
address some of the sensitive issues affecting them and their 
communities.

‘Since the start of this, we have seen a 50 per cent increase in declarations.’
