A 14-year-old Chilean girl who asked the government for permission to die has begun reconsidering her decision.

Authorities in the country quickly said no after Valentina Maureira's YouTube video pleading to let doctors euthanize her because she is tired of her struggle with cystic fibrosis began spreading on social media last month.

Now the girl is reconsidering after meeting others living with her disease.

Valentina Maureira, 14, has said she is reconsidering her wish to end her cystic fibrosis with assisted suicide after meeting others surviving with the disease. Above, she met with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet

A YouTube video made by the young girl (right) quickly spread through social media in Chile, prompting a response from the government

'There are people that made ​​me change the way of thinking,' Maureira told the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio,

'It's a difficult decision,' she said, according to 24Horas.Cl.

She said that the idea to end her life first began when she heard about the case of Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old American with terminal brain cancer who died by doctor-assisted suicide last year.

Maureira then grabbed the  attention of the country after posting on YouTube a video that appeared to have been shot from a hospital bed.

'I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,' said the teenager, whose older brother died at age 6 from the same disease. 

'I want her approval so I can get a shot that will make me sleep forever.'

Fredy Maureira said his daughter was moved by a visit by a family from Argentina, whose children have been stricken by the incurable respiratory illness.

He said she also was given hope by meeting someone who had survived beyond age 20 with the disease. 

Maribel Oviedo and her father Ernesto traveled to Santiago to 'convey a message of hope,' according to La Voz.

The young girl met with Maribel Oviedo (right) 22, of Argentina, who watched her sister died of cystic fibrosis but survived herself after receiving a lung transplant for the disease

Oviedo said that she wanted to deliver a 'message of hope' to Maureira and prove that it is possible to live a 'normal life' after struggling with the disease

The Argentine still maintains a Facebook page dedicated to her sister (pictured) who died of cystic fibrosis in 2013

Maribel, 22, from Cordoba, watched her sister Marisol die of cystic fibrosis in 2013. 

She received a lung transplant in 2012 and told the girl that she now lives a normal life.

The Argentine offered to go to a doctor's appointment with her because she wants to encourage Maureira to live.

They also shared contact information for doctors in Brazil. 

'Mission accomplished ... the decision was positive. She wants to travel to Brazil,' Oviedo posted on Facebook after meeting with the Chilean.

Cystic fibrosis damages multiple organs, especially the lungs, by causing recurrent infections that damage tissue.

The young Maureira said she was frustrated by the lack of options and by how the disease had hurt her quality of life.

Euthanasia is not legal in Chile. 

The country's president Michelle Bachelet visited her in a hospital late last month and spoke with the girl and her father for more than an hour at the Catholic University hospital in Santiago. 

What was said was not released, but the government provided photographs of the visit, including one of Maureira taking a selfie with the president, who is also a pediatrician.

Many people reached out to the girl after hearing about her video, including the president (center) and an Argentine family whose children also have cystic fibrosis 

A Chilean presidential spokesman said 'It's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish'

Fredy Maureira said that his daughter asked for quality hospitals to fight cystic fibrosis, a marathon for the disease and help making a movie and book about her story.

The president responded by sending back a tape recorder for her to take down impressions of her experience, according to Univision. 

Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said that although 'it's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish.'

The girl's father said he supported his daughter's request, though he added that he 'cried through the night' after he first heard about her wish to die.

'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' Mr Maureira said. 

He now says that his daughter is 'thinking about' her choice. 

The Chilean health ministry began providing Maureira with psychological assistance as well as medical treatment after getting in touch with her.

Maurerira asked the president for better hospitals to treat her disease, as well as a marathon and help making a movie, according to her father Fredy Maureira
