An Iowa jury has taken less than a day to acquit Theresa 'Terri' Supino of the 1983 slayings of her estranged husband and his girlfriend in a brutal cold case that has come to be known as the Copper Dollar Ranch murders.

Steven Fisher, 20, and his girlfriend Melisa Gregory, 17, were bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer at the ranch where they worked in what police at the time described as a 'crime of passion'.

On March 3, 2014 - exactly 31 years to the day of the crime - Supino was arrested and charged with double homicide at her Des Moines home, but police refused to reveal the new break that lead them to her.

As the not guilty verdict was handed down in Waterloo on Friday, a defiant Supino, 57, told reporters she's ready for police to 'leave me the hell alone', according to The Des Moines Register.

'Leave me alone': Theresa Supino had a message for police as she addressed the media on Friday, February 20, 2015, after she was acquitted of two counts of first-degree murder

Supino's defense attorneys argued over the 10-day trial that there was no physical evidence linking her to the gruesome beating deaths, which left the bodies of the two victims so badly disfigured, investigators initially thought they had been repeatedly shot in the head.

They claimed the Jasper County Sheriff’s Department called upon the TV show Cold Justice to help them solve the murders, after an investigation spanning three decades failed to show up anything.

The show features a former prosecutor, crime scene investigator and homicide detective, who re-investigate cold cases, according to Who TV. 

The defense claimed police only arrested Supino in order to give the Cold Justice episode a good ending, saying the whole process was 'a joke'.

Supino said Friday she is now consulting her lawyers as to whether she should sue the show.

Prosecutors, however, said Supino was a jealous wife who 'snapped' when her husband left her their two kids and quickly took up with a younger woman.

Supino and Fisher had two children together and were still married at the time of his death, however they had separated.

Fisher had started stating Gregory, who he worked with at the at the Copper Dollar Ranch, a horse ranch about four miles northwest of Newton.

On March 2, 1983, the pair had spent the night together at the ranch in a trailer Fisher had been living in.

The next day a co-worker found their brutally-beaten bodies just before 8am.

Fisher was found lying face down near the barn, wearing only blue jeans.

Gregory was inside the trailer about 50 meters away.

Terri Supino was married to 20-year-old Steven Fisher though they were separated. Fisher and his girlfriend, 17-year-old Melisa Gregory,were found dead on March 3, 1983 at the ranch were Fisher worked in Jasper County. Supino has now been acquitted of the murders

The gruesome murders rocked the tiny town, however police said that while they had a suspect, there was not enough evidence to arrest them.

An FBI profiler called in to help with the investigation called the case a 'crime of passion' that was 'up close and personal' and done by someone 'who was angry'.

According to BethBardner.com, with all the time that has passed, many people, including family members of Melisa Gregory, had long ago decided Supino was innocent.

Fox News reported last year that, in a written statement, Jasper County Sheriff John Halferty said their investigation was still far from over and urged people with additional information to come forward.

'In the 31 years since the deaths of Steven and Melisa, the deputies, officers, agents, criminalists and many others have remained dedicated to assuring this case was never forgotten,' he said.

Halferty told the Newton Daily News he started looking into the cold case in 2003.

He said he knew Gregory from junior high school and that her murder had forever stayed in the back of his mind.

He started 'digging into' the case when he was in a position to do so.

'I was new to junior high and I just remember how friendly she was to me,' Halferty said at a vigil in 2013.

'I live with that memory, and I'm in a position now where I think it is time. 

'There are people locally that can help us with this case, and we're asking you to come forward and talk to us.'
