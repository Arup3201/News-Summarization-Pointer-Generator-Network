A British surfer was forced to turn to boxing when he was attacked by a shark in New Zealand.

Darren Mills escaped death when he ‘punched and pushed’ the shark after it sunk its teeth into him.

‘When the shark hit me it sort of pushed me out [of the water] and I realised what was going on and I could see it,’ said Mr Mills from Crawley, West Sussex.

Lucky: Darren Mills escaped death when he 'punched and pushed' the shark after it sunk its teeth into him

Mr Mills' surfboard is pockmarked with a semicircle of tooth marks from what experts, believe was a 9ft great white shark

‘I tried to punch it but it was more like a push,’ added the 28-year-old, who suffered a serious bite wound to his right leg after Friday’s attack.

‘I was pretty scared it was going to come back,’ he said from his hospital bed in the southern city of Invercargill yesterday.

He added:  ‘There’s a puncture wound just below my knee, which might have gone, or has gone, through a tendon, and then there’s four lacerations up my leg to the top of my thigh’.

Mr Mills is the second person to be attacked by a shark off the South Island within the past month

He managed to stay on his board and ride a wave back to land.

A holidaying doctor and nurse on the shore gave him first aid until a rescue helicopter arrived to fly him to hospital.

Fellow
 surfer Nick Smart, who witnessed the incident, said: ‘He was sitting on
 his surfboard and the shark came up from nowhere and hit him.

‘You could see blood and he was definitely in pain.’

Mr
 Mills’ surfboard is pockmarked with a semicircle of tooth marks from 
what experts, given the bite’s size, believe was a 9ft great white 
shark.

‘When the attack first happened I was, like, “I’m not even getting in the bath tub again,”’ he said.

‘But I just want to get back and surf again. I just feel really, really lucky. Really lucky,’ he added.

Mr
 Mills, who is living in the ski resort of Queenstown, is the second 
person to be attacked by a shark off the South Island within the past 
month.
