Jason Cuellar, 44, is accused of hitting a  man over the head with a bottle 'because he was black'

A central Florida man faces hate crime charges after authorities say he told a man the bar they were in wasn't for blacks and hit him with a bottle.

Forty-four-year-old Jason Cuellar was brought to the Volusia County Jail following the Friday night incident.

Deputies say 24-year-old Kenneth Hodge was at the Hideout Lounge when Cuellar, who is white, told him 'this bar is not for blacks.'

The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports Hodge ignored the comment.

A Volusia County sheriff's report says Cuellar then grabbed a beer bottle and hit Hodge on the head, cutting him.

The report says Hodge wrestled Cuellar to the ground but he got away.

Several bar patrons tried to stop him but Cuellar allegedly used pepper spray in their eyes

Cueller managed to escape the bar at first but police caught up with him as he was riding as a passenger in a friend's car.

Friend Ellis Lloyd told police he was driving Cueller home because he called him to say he had pepper sprayed multiple people at the bar.

'The aggravated battery charge was reclassified to one degree higher due to the hate crime allegation,' investigating deputies wrote in the police report.

Jail records don't indicate whether he has a lawyer.
