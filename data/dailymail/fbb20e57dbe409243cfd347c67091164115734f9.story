Ross Katsambanis, a commerce student and AFL fan, was outraged when he was required to sign a legal waiver at the Hellenic Republic restaurant in Brunswick

A Melbourne man said he 'nearly choked on his succulent, slow-cooked lamb' after he had to sign a legal waiver to take his food home from an exclusive restaurant in a doggy bag.

Monash University student Ross Katsambanis, 20, visited the Hellenic Republic restaurant on Lygon St, Brunswick East, Victoria, on the night of December 27 to celebrate his grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary.

There were plenty of leftovers but he was stunned when a waitress at the restaurant - co-owned by George Calombaris - told him he would have to sign a legal document to take home his meat and dips.

'I nearly choked on my succulent slow-cooked lamb after hearing this news,' he wrote in a blog post afterwards.

Mr Katsambanis said he was told the waiver was introduced to comply with local council regulations.

''I thought that's just bizarre,' he told Daily Mail Australia in an  interview. 'All I wanted to do was take it home and eat it.'

A Moreland City Council spokesman denied their health regulations were responsible, saying they only applied to food consumed on restaurant premises. 

However, restaurant industry sources said they were increasingly being targeted by litigious customers who were taking their food home and getting sick.

'I hereby take full responsibility for the removal of food from Hellenic Republic Brunswick': The waiver customers who request doggy bags are asked to sign

Mr Katsambanis told Daily Mail Australia he never had any intentions to sue the restaurant.

'It was going to be my responsibility. If I did get food poisoning, it would have been my fault.' 

'There's no chance I was going to sue them.... I was just surprised to have to sign a waiver to take home some food. 

Lauren Calleja, spokeswoman for MAdE Establishments - which operates prestigious restaurants the Hellenic Republic, Press Club and Maha - said the warnings were in the customer's best interest

'We don't really know how they're going to store the food,' said Ms Calleja. 'It's kind of out of our hands what the customer does for it after they leave the venue.' 

'It's more to make sure they are going to eat it they do it in a healthy time and they refrigerate it. it's in their best interests. 

She said food customers wanted to doggy bag had often been left on the plate for a 'couple of hours' after they ordered it. 'We don't get a lot of (doggy bag requests)', she added.

John Hart, the CEO of the Restaurant and Caterers Association of Australia, said restaurants were increasingly being targeted by strict liability suits after food had been consumed.

Mr Hart said he was 'not surprised' restaurants were issuing legal waivers. 

'As we all know we're becoming more of a litigious society and we end up with people hoiding us responsible for incidents that happen away from our businesses,' Mr Hart said.

The Association has produced stickers for restaurants to use on doggy bags which warn customers not to hold onto takeaway food for more than 24 hours.  

Ms Calleja said Hellenic Republic's waivers had nothing to do with an incident at Hellenic Republic restaurant in Kew in May 2014 where two groups of diners were struck down by the norovirus.

The waivers were introduced 'three or four years ago', she said.
