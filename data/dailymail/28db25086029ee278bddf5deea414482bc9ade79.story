Sheffield United eased into the FA Cup third round at Plymouth’s expense in a tale of three penalties.

League Two Argyle were left to wonder what might have been had Reuben Reid not skewed a spot-kick into the stand early in the second half.

They were punished in ruthless fashion by Jose Baxter, who sent the League One promotion contenders through with two textbook penalties.

And the impressive Marc McNulty rounded off the win in the final minute, sweeping in a right-wing cross from Florent Cuvelier.

The Blades battled their way to the semi-finals in this competition last season - losing in an eight-goal thriller to Hull City - but Wembley in the springtime was a world removed from this.

On a chilly afternoon, Bramall Lane was barely a third full and those that did turn up had to endure a pretty soporific first-half.

The hosts, who needed a replay to beat Crewe in round one, started the brighter and skipper Michael Doyle wasn’t too far wide with a 25-yard sighter after Michael Higdon had teed him up.

A couple of minutes later, Ryan Flynn roared forward from right-back and his firmly-struck shot was pushed clear by Luke McCormick.

Plymouth, who saw off Conference North outfit AFC Fylde to reach the second round, threatened sporadically. Jason Banton was their liveliest player and keen to make an impression having not started a match since mid-September.

He swapped passes with Andy Kellett as Argyle sprung forward but the latter was pulled up by referee Gary Sutton for diving in the box.

Banton also dragged an effort wide after Lewis Alessandra intercepted a loose Stefan Scougall pass and raced down the right flank.

For a while, the League Two promotion challengers were setting the pace and Dominic Blizzard enjoyed their best chance of the half, firing across goal and wide after Banton played him in.

United, who have a Capital One Cup quarter-final with Southampton coming up on Tuesday week, roused themselves and Flynn was able to cut inside and roll the ball just wide of the post.

The second half could only be an improvement and Plymouth immediately had a chance to steal the lead. Alessandra got goal side of Jay McEveley and was dragged to the turf for a clear penalty.

But, in front of the end where the 638 travelling fans were gathered, Reid sliced his spot-kick into the stand.

It was a massive let-off for the Blades and they went straight on the offensive, with half-time substitute McNulty firing a fraction wide.

McNulty was making quite an impact and when Ben Purrington grappled with him as he tried to break into the Argyle area, the referee had no hesitation in awarding another spot-kick.

Baxter showed Reid how to dispatch from 12 yards, leaving McCormick no chance with a drilled penalty into the bottom left corner.

And just after the hour, United were awarded another penalty when Peter Hartley brought down Jamie Murphy in the area. Again, Baxter made no mistake.

Baxter had an excellent chance to complete his hat-trick with 12 minutes left but missed the target when well placed.

His job was done, however, and he received a standing ovation when replaced in the final five minutes as the Blades made further Cup gains.
