Brain dead: Jahi McMath was declared brain dead on December 12 after she went into cardiac arrest following surgery to treat sleep apnea

It is exactly a year since 13-year-old Jahi McMath fell brain dead following a minor operation and doctors signed her death certificate.

But she remains hooked to a ventilator.

In a case that has ignited debate over the definition of brain death, Jahi's parents remain adamant that as long as her heart is beating, she is alive.

To prove that point, the family from Oakland, California, released videos in October of the girl which showed her foot and hand appearing to move in response to her mother's commands. 

However, numerous medics have dismissed the apparent development as involuntary muscle reflex often seen in brain-dead patients - the so-called Lazarus effect.  

Paul Fisher, a Stanford University pediatric neurologist, told a California judge in October that he sees no evidence that Jahi McMath is alive 10 months after a coroner signed her death certificate.

Jahi was declared brain dead on December 12, 2013, after she went into cardiac arrest following surgery to treat sleep apnea.

Fisher dismissed videos showing the girl moving her hands and feet at her mother's command.  

Her family wants Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo to issue what would be an unprecedented order to reverse the death certificate, declaring her to be alive after being declared brain dead.

The family's lawyer Christopher Dolan told the judge he wanted time for the court-appointed doctor and his own medical experts to confer. No new court date has been scheduled. 

'There wasn't time to react to this letter,' Dolan said. 'Given the fact that we were up against the time crunch ... I thought that we were going to be in essence sandbagged.' 

Dolan objected to Fisher's appointment as an independent expert, arguing that the doctor has a conflict of interest because he was one of the physicians who agreed with the brain-death diagnosis last December.

'I just wanted to give these doctors a chance to talk,' Dolan said.

Five other medical professionals who performed new tests on the teenager in New Jersey in September said the girl showed signs of brain function.

In his letter to the judge, Fisher replied that the tests either were irrelevant to determining brain death in a child or not carried out in accordance with accepted medical standards.

'None of the declarations provide evidence that Jahi McMath is not brain dead,' he wrote.

Jahi has been kept on a ventilator and feeding tubes since she suffered severe complications from the surgery. Fisher examined her then at the request of the judge while her family fought a hospital's decision to remove the equipment.

Fisher was one of three doctors who declared her brain-dead after finding no neurological activity.

Dolan has given the judge the results of a September 1 electroencephalogram that a researcher at a medical school in Cuba said showed electrical activity in Jahi's brain.

Fisher, in his letter to the judge, said the new test was performed in an apartment, not a health care setting, and the recorded activity could have come from elsewhere in the girl's body or even the environment.

Regardless, he said, a flat reading on the exam is not a prerequisite for brain death.

Fisher similarly took issue with the brain scan that allegedly showed blood flowing to Jahi's brain. 

He said the test doctors and researchers from the nonprofit International Brain Research Foundation used was incorrect and would not have demonstrated such blood flow.

Jahi's mother, Latasha Winkfield, has worked to keep her daughter's organs functioning on life support, first at Children's Hospital in Oakland and later at an undisclosed medical facility, and now a house in New Jersey.

Unlike California, New Jersey law allows families to reject a declaration of brain death on religious grounds and allows brain-dead patients to remain connected to ventilators.
