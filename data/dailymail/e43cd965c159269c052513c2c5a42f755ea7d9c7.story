A gang member who shot dead two undercover cops in New York in 2003 has been sentenced to death by lethal injection for the second time.

Ronell Wilson was first handed the death sentence in 2007, but an appeal court later overruled it.

However, the jury at his retrial took just over four hours to decide that the man responsible for killing James Nemorin and Rodney Andrews in Staten Island, should be sentenced to death.

Conviction: Ronell Wilson has been sentenced to death for the second time after his first sentence was overturned in an appeals court

Prosecutors argued that the 31-year-old 
was 'thriving' in the prison environment, where he had fathered a child 
with one of his prison guards, according to the New York Post.

They claimed that Wilson, who had poked 
his tongue out at his victims' families when he was first sentenced to 
death, should not be allowed to live out his days as a jailhouse 
celebrity.

Wilson was said to have shown a lack of remorse for his crimes, the prosecutors argued.

'When a cold killer executes two heroes for greed and glory and dumps their bodies on the street, the death penalty is perfectly justified ... We ask that you impose the ultimate punishment for the ultimate crime,' the court was told in closing arguments, according to SI Live.

They added that Wilson had shot Mr Nemorin, the father of three children, in the head as he pleaded for his life.

Moments earlier he had shot Mr Andrews, who was also a father, in the back of the head.

The defence had argued that Wilson 
was born into a troubled life, to a neglectful drug addict of a mother, 
and an absent father.

Defense
lawyer David Stern described his client as being a 'learning-disabled and
severely emotionally disturbed' man who had never been taught the 
difference between right and wrong, SI Live said.

The defense added that the prospect of growing old behind bars was enough of a punishment for Wilson.

However,
Wilson was described in court as being threatening and bullying towards
other inmates. He also convinced prison guard Nancy Gonzalez to have 
sex with him.

Gonzalez, 29, who pleaded guilty to 
have sex with Wilson between March and August 2012, gave birth to their 
son, Justus, in March.

Earlier
in the retrial, the families of Wilson's victims gave impact 
statements. Mr Andrews's widow, Maryann, told the court: 'The pain will 
never go away. The world kept moving, but time stopped for us.'

According to the Daily News,
she added: 'Rodney loved his children so much. All he ever wanted was 
to grow old with his children and see his children grow old. Our lives 
were ruined.'

'I think what the jury recognized is not only the severity of the crimes that were committed but also that Ronell Wilson is not going to change,' Detectives Endowment Association president Michael Palladino, said.

'He’s a thug. It’s in his DNA. He actually enjoys it,' he added after the trial.

Wilson will now be taken to death row at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. His trial was heard in a federal court because New York abolished the death penalty in 2004.
