Most couples who renew their wedding vows do so several years after they first step down the aisle.

But Gemma and Luke Stewart are not a couple with time on their side.

Their vow renewal on a beautiful Corfu beach last October, just a year after they first married, was a symbol of just how much time they might have left together.

For Gemma, 30, has been told she may have just three months to live, after being diagnosed with terminal malignant melanoma.

Gemma Stewart says being told she had terminal cancer made her realise boyfriend Luke (pictured) was the love of her life. The couple married in October 2011

But while she is clearly devastated at her diagnosis, she also believes it has made the last few months of her life some of the best.

Put simply, she says: ‘Being told I had terminal cancer made me realise Luke was the love of my life.‘Suddenly everything becomes very clear and you realise exactly what it is you want.’

Until then, the couple, who have been together for eight years, had been unsure of their future.

As Gemma explains: ‘We always loved each other but it just didn’t work the first couple of times we lived together. I am quite bohemian and a hoarder of stuff and Luke is the total opposite. We also had different outlooks on life, to some degree.

The couple enjoyed a 30's Hollywood glam-style themed wedding. Until her diagnosis, they had been unsure of their future

‘I was also badly affected by the death of my father at the beginning of 2009 as he was the person who basically brought me up and we were extremely close. 

'Being told I had terminal cancer made me realise Luke was the love of my life'

‘After that, I had a burning desire to have children to continue Dad’s blood line. But Luke wasn’t ready to have a family and that caused a huge rift between us.

‘In hindsight, it really wasn’t the right time to go about it, as I was incredibly raw. ‘Now we’ve made it work because we’ve realised how much we love each other.’

The couple, who live in Farnborough, Hampshire, met in April 2005 in a nightclub. 

‘It was a very cheesy nightclub and we both stood out like sore thumbs,’ Gemma told MailOnline.  ‘We’d both been dragged along by the groups of friends we were with. But we got talking and just clicked. He took my number and we went on a date shortly afterwards.’

Over the next few years they had a couple of minor breakups, but always remained friends. And they were back together when in October 2010, Gemma found a lump near her groin. 

‘I spoke with Luke and he encouraged me to go see a doctor,’ she recalls. ‘Neither of us dreamed it could be cancer.

Shock diagnosis: Very fair skinned, Gemma has never been a tanner and was always careful in the sun

'My doctor agreed - I was too young and had lived a healthy lifestyle, so he was sure it was nothing sinister. But as a precaution, he decided to run a few tests.'

'I just couldn't believe what I was hearing... it was like being smacked around the face'

She began to feel uneasy when she was called in for a biopsy – and rightly so, for the news that followed was shattering. The biopsy had revealed malignant melanoma in her lymph nodes.

‘It was such a shock as I have never been a tanner – I just couldn’t believe what I was hearing,’ she  says ‘It was like being smacked around the face.

‘My mind was whirring with questions – when had it started, how had I got it when I’d always been so careful in the sun?’

Doctors told her the primary site of the melanoma was in the middle of the ball of her foot. 

‘Looking back, I had felt very run down, but I put that down to my busy job as a special needs teacher working with autistic children, commuting and the stress of Dad dying,' she says. 

‘I was warned from the start that it wasn’t good. I was pretty much slap bang in the middle of stage three, advanced cancer and was already very ill.’

The couple renewed their vows in Corfu last October, just a year after they first married. Gemma's blue wig is to symbolise the Greek theme

Gemma immediately underwent major surgery at the Royal Marsden to remove 37 lymph nodes, before undergoing chemotherapy.

'I am so grateful for every day we have together'

But that failed to stop the cancer spreading and just seven months later, in May 2011, she received the devastating news that the cancer was terminal. 

‘When I heard the news, all I could think about was Luke,’ she recalls. ‘We’d broken up again in the January but now everything seemed so clear, and I had to be with him. 

‘He was at work and I couldn't bear to tell him over the phone. I waited for him to come around to my house and when I told him my prognosis we hugged and cried and told each other how much we loved each other. 

‘It was then that I realised that the man in front of me really was the love of my life and before I knew it, I was telling him I wanted to marry him. He felt the same and proposed then and there. 

‘Suddenly, everything became very clear and I no longer cared about anything in the past or the silly rows we’d had.

‘I knew regardless of what happened Luke would always be there for me. He was my rock, the one person who could cheer me up no matter what.

Gemma says: 'When I do pass away I will be happy because in Luke I have found the love of my life and nothing else matters. I am so grateful for every day we have together'

‘I just knew that I wanted to marry him, have a fabulous day celebrating our love and enjoying the time we had left together.’

Not knowing how long she he had left, Gemma set about planning her 30’s Hollywood glam-style wedding. 

And in October 2011 she and Luke, 36, who works for a luxury mobile phone company, married in front of their friends and family in a Farnborough boutique hotel.

‘It was the best day of my life and I couldn't have been happier,’ says Gemma. ‘It wasn’t about getting a piece of paper, it was about celebrating our love with friends.'

Brave: Gemma hopes her story will serve as a cautionary tale to those striving to get a sun tan

Since her diagnosis, Gemma has also thrown herself into travelling the world, visiting destinations such as the Mauritius, Australia and New York and the Caribbean.

And in October, the couple celebrated their first anniversary by having a blessing in Corfu – the destination of their first holiday. 

Having lost her hair due to radiotherapy on her brain, after tumours were also discovered there, Gemma decided to embrace the Greek theme and wear a blue wig.

‘I just thought “if I’m going to wear a wig, why not wear a fabulous blue one and do the Grecian look”.'

She has chosen to share her story now to try and prevent others suffering a similar fate.

‘I just want to make sure people don’t get to my stage. I have always been fair skinned and never a tanner, but I must have been burnt on my foot at some stage and that’s what triggered the cancer, although I have no recollection of it. 

‘I was always very careful, wearing factor 30. So look after yourself and don’t sacrifice your life for a tan. I can’t stress enough how much it’s not worth it.’

She is now planning her 31st birthday in March as her next milestone to reach, and something to focus on.  

‘But I know that if I do pass away I will be happy because in Luke I have found the love of my life and nothing else matters. I am so grateful for every day we have together.’
