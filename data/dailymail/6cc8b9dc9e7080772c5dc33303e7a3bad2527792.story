An innocent man sentenced to death for a child murder he did not commit walked free from prison yesterday after spending nine years behind bars.

Manuel Velez, 49, was arrested in 2005 and convicted three years later of murdering his girlfriend's one-year-old son. The former Rio Grande Valley construction worker has spent nearly six years on death row in Texas.

But his attorneys have proved that Mr Velez, could not have been responsible for the injuries that killed the boy, since he was working a construction job in Tennessee 1,000 miles  away.

Manuel Velez, 49, emerged from Huntsville prison in Texas a free man just after 11.30pm last night

They showed that the laborer had suffered woefully inadequate legal representation at trial  and his former lawyer had failed to point out that his girlfriend had a history of child abuse.

An appeals court threw out his conviction and Mr Velez accepted a plea bargain to a lesser charge, allowing him to be paroled. He emerged from Huntsville prison a free man just after 11.30pm last night.

'Manuel never belonged in prison, let alone on death row waiting to be executed. He is indisputably innocent,' said Velez's attorney, Brian Stull of the American Civil Liberties Union Capital Punishment Project.

'My joy for him and his family today is tinged with sadness for the years our criminal justice system stole from him, all because he was too poor to afford better counsel than the lawyer the state appointed to him.'

Mr Velez, an illiterate Spanish speaker with an IQ of 65, signed a written confession in English he did not understand, following the death of Angel Moreno.

The baby was just under a year old when he was taken to hospital on 31 October 2005 suffering breathing difficulties. He died just two days later due to a severe brain injury.

Two weeks earlier Mr Velez had moved into the Brownsville home of his new girlfriend, Acela Moreno, then aged 25, the mother of Angel. 

Initially, both Mr Velez and the victim's mother were charged with capital murder, the Guardian reports. But before the trial began, Ms Moreno accepted a plea bargain with the state of Texas in which she pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of having injured her child by hitting him or slamming his head against a wall.

Angel's mother  was sentenced to 10 years in prison. She was released in 2010, before being immediately deported to her home country of Mexico, having been staying in the United States illegally.

As part of the plea deal, Ms Moreno had agreed to testify against Mr Velez and she told the court that Angel's physical problems only started when her new boyfriend moved into the home.

This was despite the fact that she told police in a recorded interview at the time of her arrest that Mr Velez had never struck her son or mistreated him in any way. 

The jury also never heard about a prosecution expert's report indicating that autopsy results showed that the critical head trauma occurred 18 and 36 days before Angel died. 

Manuel Velez was arrested in 2005 and convicted three years later of murdering a one-year-old 

During this time Mr Velez was not in contact with the child, but was 1,000 miles away on a job at a construction site in Memphis, Tennessee.

There was also evidence that Ms Moreno abused her child, and that she had once thrown Angel onto a couch from five feet away when she was angered by his crying. 

Members of her family testified that they had seen the mother neglect and abuse her young son, the Guardian reported. Her sister revealed that Ms Moreno had once admitted to her that she had bitten Angel on the face.

In her own videotaped interrogation by police Ms Moreno also said she had burned Angel with a cigarette. She also told detectives: 'I may have burned Angel's foot when I carried him, but only once.'

But the defense lawyers did not call any of the witnesses with this information to testify.

'We should be ashamed of the errors that put Manuel on the brink of execution. He is far from the only innocent person to receive a death sentence,' said Mr Stull.

'A recent study estimated that, conservatively, one in every 25 people sentenced to death in the United States is innocent. In such a broken system of justice, we are foolish and cruel to continue capital punishment.'

According to Death Penalty Information Center's director Richard Dieter, 'the release of former death row inmate Manuel Velez in Texas today underscores the many problems that continue to plague the death penalty and the ongoing risk of executing the innocent.

His 'case contained a litany of injustices, including police misconduct, prosecutorial deception, ineffectiveness of defense counsel, and untruthful witnesses.

'The death of a child because of abuse is a terrible tragedy, but evidence uncovered after Mr. Velez's trial in 2008 indicates the abuse occurred when he was a thousand miles away.'

The DPIC has tallied 146 death row inmates whose convictions have been overturned and who have been freed since 1973 - including 10 in Texas.
