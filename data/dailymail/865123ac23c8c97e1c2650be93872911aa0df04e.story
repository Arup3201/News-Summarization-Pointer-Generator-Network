Businesswoman: New mothers should limit the amount of maternity leave they take, claims Harriet Green, the chief executive of Thomas Cook

New mothers should limit the amount of maternity leave they take - or face losing confidence in the workplace, a top UK businesswoman has claimed.

Harriet Green OBE, the chief executive of Thomas Cook, spoke out against a year's maternity leave, which all working mothers are entitled to under government regulations.

The 52-year-old claimed mothers who are out of the workplace lose confidence 'very fast' - and also urged women to 'make choices' instead of trying to achieve perfection in all areas of their life.

Speaking to The Times, Ms Green said: 'You need to get the balance right, you can take it too far. It may have gone a little too far in terms of some of the pressures.

'For me, a year [of maternity leave] feels a little long. Women out of the workplace lose confidence very fast.

'What I would do if I were prime minister is give a set number of weeks and allow the family to decide, male and female, how they divvy it up.'

Ms Green, who is married with stepchildren, but none of her own, was appointed to the travel firm in 2012 and is one of the few women in Britain to lead a FTSE 250 company.

She was awarded the job after cold-calling chairman Frank Meysman to tell him she was the right person to lead the recovery of the world’s oldest travel business.

Since then, she has taken Thomas Cook from the brink of collapse to a thriving company which is worth £2.5billion - a staggering 1,250 per cent rise in less than two years.

Last year, Ms Green, who sits on the prime minister's business advisory group, was paid £2.4million, including a £1.7million bonus.

During the interview, the businesswoman 
said she believed that women should be more pushy in applying for jobs because 'What's the worst that can 
happen?'

But she added that they should not strive to be perfect at work, home and in their social life - and should, instead, try to 'make choices' based on their strengths and desires.

She also said that school term dates need to be changed so parents can afford to take 
their children on holiday, sexism in the boardroom is yet to be conquered and companies should be as diverse in age, background and education as their customers.

Last night, Sharon Hodgson, the shadow 
minister for women and equalities, condemned Ms Green's claims 
that mothers should restrict their maternity leave.

She deemed the remarks 'unfortunate', particularly considering the businesswoman's success in increasing equality at the top of a big UK firm.

It comes just days after Ms Green was awarded the Veuve Clicquot businesswoman of the year award for her role in Thomas Cook's transformation.

The businesswoman, who was presented with her award in a ceremony at London’s Claridge’s hotel, said: ‘It’s a great honour to receive this award, which has been won by so many outstanding women in the past.’
