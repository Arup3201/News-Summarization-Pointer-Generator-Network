Bank of England chief Sir Mervyn King said bankers had to realise they 'can¿t just exist on their own'

Goldman Sachs has abandoned plans to delay paying out bonuses to help bankers avoid the 50p tax rate.

The u-turn came hours after Bank of England boss Sir Mervyn King branded the idea 'depressing' and accused bankers of mis-judging public anger at the damage caused by the financial crash.

The investment bank had considered waiting to 
award equity bonuses deferred from previous years, due to pay out this 
month, until after April 6.

It would mean tax on the payouts would have been paid at the 45p 
rate instead of the 50p rate for high earners.

But people familiar with the bank's deliberations said the Comp Committee of the board met today and ruled out the idea.

In a devastating attack on attitudes in the City, Sir Mervyn accused the super-rich of thinking it was 'exciting' to use a loophole which could cost the taxpayer millions.

'I find it a bit depressing that people who earn so much seem to think it's even more exciting to kind of adjust the timing of it to get the benefit of a lower tax rate which they will benefit from in the long run to a very great extent,' he told the Treasury Select Committee.

Sir Mervyn, who will stand down as Bank of England Governor in June, said City firms had to consider the reputational damage the move would cause.

'I think it would be rather clumsy and rather lacking in care and attention to how other people might react and , in the long run, financial institutions, like all large institutions do depend on good will from the rest of society, they can’t just exist on their own.'

British taxpayers could lose out on 
millions of pounds if super-rich bankers press ahead with the idea of delaying their bonuses until after the 50p tax rate 
is scrapped.

Chancellor 
George Osborne came under pressure to take action to close the loophole 
which could lead to a massive shortfall in Treasury coffers.

The revelation will 
add to the sense of public fury after it emerged bankers at the firm are
expected to reward themselves £8.3 billion in bonuses tomorrow.

Staggering: Bankers at Goldman Sachs are expected to share £8.3billion in bonuses

Shadow
treasury minister Chris Leslie said: 'Goldman Sachs has made the right decision, but the fact remains that from April thousands of bankers and millionaires will get a huge tax cut from David Cameron and George Osborne.'

The
American investment bank, which employs 5,500 staff in the UK, will be 
the first to unveil its telephone number-sized rewards – an average of 
£250,000 a person – as part of the latest round of bonus updates.

The
increase, up from £230,000 last year, comes as British families are 
still struggling to make ends meet five years after banks brought the 
economy to the brink of meltdown.

About half of the top 20 banks in the City had considered delaying UK payouts, the Financial Times reported.

In
2010 bankers brought forward their bonuses by a few weeks ahead of the 
introduction of the 50p rate for people earning more than £150,000, 
costing the taxpayer £16billion.

Chancellor George Osborne will be urged to act to stop bankers avoiding tax by delaying their big bonuses until after April 6

By delaying a bonus until after April 6, a banker with a salary of £150,000 awarded a £100,000 bonus would save £5,000 in tax.

Lib
Dem MP John Hemming said any bank caught dodging tax in this way should
be banned from being awarded lucrative government contracts.

Calls for restraint by politicians, who have used taxpayers cash to bailout many of the banks, have fallen on deaf ears.

At
taxpayer-backed Lloyds Banking Group, which is expected to make a loss 
this year, its boss is likely to be entitled to a multimillion-pound 
bonus.

Some of the reward 
for chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio is linked to the share price, 
which has doubled, and customer satisfaction, which means he could be in
line for a £4.4 million fortune.

But
most of the anger will be directed at Goldman Sachs whose vice chairman
said back in 2009 ‘inequality is a way of achieving greater opportunity
and prosperity for all’.

The
comments by Lord Griffiths echoed those of fictional banker Gordon 
Gekko in the film Wall Street - whose mantra ‘greed is good’ came to sum
up the excesses of the 1980s.

Griffiths
was of the view that taxpayers should ‘tolerate the inequality’ and 
insisted banks should not be ashamed of rewarding staff.

True
to this ethos Goldman is likely to have boosted its salary and bonus 
pot to £8.3 billion from £7.6 billion the previous year due to increased
profits.

The last three months have been strong with share trading and bonds performing well.

Global profit could top £3.79 billion up from £2.73 billion.

The
lavish windfalls come as new research shows pay rewards are failing to 
incentivise Britain’s big bosses to improve the long term success of 
their businesses.

Executive pay packages across 
Britain’s biggest firms are ‘overwhelmingly’ linked to short-term 
financial measures such as earnings and share price movement, according 
to research from the High Pay Centre lobby group.

However
it shows chief executive pay has trebled to £4.8million, on average, in
ten years without any accompanying long-term increase in share values.

At
Lloyds, the bank has experienced a short term stock rise, but given the
political tensions over banking bonuses, the Lloyds directors may 
decide not to pay the full amount to the Portuguese banker, who last 
year waived his bonus following a prolonged period of sick leave.

Lloyds shares were the second best performing of Europe’s banks last year and closed last week at 54p, up from 25.5p in May.

But
the bank is still expected to make a full year loss of about £1.4 
billion, as it continues to suffer from bad debts from corporate loans 
and a big bill over the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.

The
40 per cent state-owned lender was pushed to a £144 million loss in the
three months to 30 September, as it took an additional £1 billion 
charge for dealing with the scandal, taking its total to £5.3 billion.

Lloyds froze basic pay for 500 senior staff for the third year in a row on Friday.
