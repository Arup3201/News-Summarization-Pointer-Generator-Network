Another night of heartbreak. Just when it appeared Ivory Coast had something to smile about, their dreams of World Cup progress were dramatically shattered by Greece.

They were within 90 seconds of reaching the last 16 but a reckless foul by substitute Giovanni Sio enabled Giorgios Samaras to rifle in a penalty to secure a 2-1 win in Fortaleza and allow Greece to progress to the last 16 for the first time in their history.

Greece’s joy was in sharp contrast to Ivory Coast’s anguish. This game was played out with the death of Yaya and Kolo Toure’s brother Ibrahim still fresh in the mind and their country has been hit by severe flooding in recent weeks.

Yaya accused Manchester City of lacking compassion and not allowing to spend time with Ibrahim in the days after City won the Premier League title.

Just when it seemed as though they would 
have something to smile about, when Swansea’s Wilfried Bony scored in 
the 74th minute, their hopes were ripped away.

For so long Ivory 
Coast have looked like they could make an impact at a World Cup finals 
but their recent history in this tournament is littered with misfortune 
and near misses. In 2006 and 2010, they were drawn in ‘groups of death’ 
and failed to make the knockout stages.

This, then, represented their
 best opportunity to progress but even though they started brightly, 
with some surging runs from one-time Arsenal flop Gervinho and 
Manchester City’s Yaya Toure, they did not have the gumption to turn the
 heat up on Greece.

Their passing was slow and deliberate, taking two
 touches when one would have done. Players who have been giants in the 
Barclays Premier League, most notably Didier Drogba, failed to replicate
 the kind of form for which they are feared.

Greece also lacked 
intensity in their efforts, which was surprising given their need for 
three points was arguably greater. To make matters worse, their gameplan
 was disrupted severely by having to make two substitutions in the 
opening half hour.

The 2004 European champions, however, sensed there
 would be some reward for them if they could get on the front foot and 
in the 33rd minute, they came agonisingly close to taking the lead when 
Jose Holebas hit the bar after being set up by Celtic striker Samaras.

Aside
 from rattling the woodwork, that shot also rattled Ivory Coast and, 
just before half-time, they conceded a goal that was of their own making
 when Newcastle’s Chieck Tiote squandered possession. Substitute Samaris
 ensured the slip received maximum punishment when he fired in from 18 
yards.

After the break, when Ivory Coast began to apply pressure, 
Greece’s defending was excellent and every successful tackle was greeted
 with thumping slaps on the back and words of encouragement. They were 
in no mood to let this opportunity slip.

Yaya Toure was still angry 
at what he claims was City’s insensitive reaction to his brother’s 
terminal illness. He told France Football: ‘At the end of the season, I 
wanted to stay for four or five days with my brother before I flew to 
prepare for the World Cup with Ivory Coast, except that City did not 
want to grant me a few days.

‘I went to celebrate the title 
championship in Abu Dhabi while my brother was lying in his sickbed. By 
fortune, Kolo was at his bedside. After that I blame myself for not 
insisting and for not making them respect me.’
