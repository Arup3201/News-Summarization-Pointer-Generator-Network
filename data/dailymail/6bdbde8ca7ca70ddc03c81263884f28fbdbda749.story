Germans have voted British Dyson vacuum cleaners as better than anything Germans can make themselves 

British Dyson vacuum cleaners are better than anything German firms make – say the Germans themselves.

The company founded by Sir James Dyson, who reinvented the vacuum cleaner by doing away with the bag, came top in a study of consumers by Germany’s Institute for Quality.

German families rated Dyson above their own Miele, Vorwerk, Siemens, AEG, Bosch and Karcher.

It is a rare example of a British manufacturer still run by its founder that is not only doing rather well in this country, but has carried the flag for innovation and quality around the world.

Indeed, Dyson cleaners are also the market leader in the home of technology, Japan, in terms of the value and volume of sales.

They are also number one in terms of value in Taiwan and Hong Kong, while it is reporting strong growth in China, where companies have a reputation for ripping off successful ideas and creating their own cheaper versions.

The study’s findings were welcomed by Dyson’s German chief executive, Max Conze, who said: ‘German consumers rate us ahead of their home grown companies, like Bosch and Miele.

‘It disproves the common thinking that only Germans can manufacture world-class technology. Interestingly we are seeing a similar pattern in Japan, where we are now number one, overtaking home grown successes in their own back yard.

‘It seems we are ‘out-Germaning the Germans!’. ‘

Dyson’s prowess means it has become a magnet for graduates and engineers, creating thousands of jobs in highly skilled jobs in this country, while its machines are made in Malaysia.

Today – 22 years after it got rid of the bag - it is unveiling its latest improved vacuum cleaner the Dyson Cinetic Big Ball.

The big change is that having done away with the bag, the new cleaner has now removed the need for a filter that – in other machines – can become clogged and needs to be cleaned or replaced.

On most existing so-called cyclone machines the filter is needed to hold the finest particles of dust that are sucked up to prevent them clogging up the tubes.

However, the Dyson team found that if they created flexible tips on the tubes which funnel the dust into the machine, they vibrate so quickly that the tiny particles cannot block them.

The flexible tips, which it calls Cinetic, vibrate 350 times a second which means dust as small as 0.5 microns, which is smaller than a skin cell, are spun through the machine and into the collecting bin.

Sir James said: ‘Removing the bag from a vacuum solved one hassle, but filter maintenance remained an annoying problem that needed fixing. 

'Dyson engineers have spent six years perfecting cyclone technology to make filter maintenance obsolete. 

'The constant flexing of Cinetic tips ensures the cyclones do not block as microscopic dust is spun out of the air – not trapped in a cyclone or on a filter.’

The technology is the result of nearly six years intensive research and development by a team of 29 Dyson engineers. Some 2,000 prototypes were developed whilst creating the new technology.

The company said the removal of the need for a filter, which can become clogged, means the machine remains a constant high level of suction, so removing dirt and dust particles that can trigger allergies. 

Its new Dyson Cinetic Big Ball machine is available from its website with a price tag of £459.99.
