Arm heavily strapped in plaster, Helena Silver looks as if she may have been in a particularly nasty accident.

But these injuries were the result of an encounter with a tom cat in her bedroom.

The library assistant suffered a dozen bite wounds when the animal attacked her as she tried to pull it away from a fight with her own cat.

Recovering: Helena Silver spent six days at Southampton General Hospital recovering after a savage attack by a neighbour's cat

Ms Silver was left with multiple bite wounds on her hand and wrist after she intervened to save her own cat Gem. After a couple of days her wrist had swelled to twice the size, right

After the incident she went to 
hospital for a tetanus jab but a short while later her hand swelled to 
twice its normal size and she had to be admitted for six days.

Her arm was put in plaster and she was given an intravenous antibiotic drip amid fears she would develop blood poisoning.

Miss Silver’s ordeal began when she 
was woken just after midnight by the noise of her own cat Gem being 
attacked in her bedroom by the ginger tom. The rival had climbed into 
the ground floor room through a top window she had left open because of 
the warm weather.

She said: ‘I’d been in a really deep 
sleep and woke up by the sound of the cats fighting. I pulled Gem away 
and the other cat just went for my right hand and sank its teeth in. It 
bit down so hard I screamed and then it did it two or three more times 
on my hand.

‘I grabbed it by the scruff of the 
neck and pulled it off my hand and chucked it straight out of the 
window. There was blood all over the carpet and the curtains and I was 
in agony.’

Miss Silver, of Southampton, bathed 
her wounds in boiled salty water and drove to hospital as a precaution. 
Doctors warned her cat bites could prove dangerous and told her to 
return in 48 hours.

Within that time Helena’s hand had ballooned in size and she was in tremendous pain. Doctors immediately admitted her to a ward.

She was put on the antibiotic drip and
her right arm was made immobile in a raised position in an attempt to 
minimise the risk of any infection spreading.

Miss Silver was told doctors might have to operate to clean the deep wounds thoroughly.

She said: ‘When they told me I needed to be admitted for surgery I was horrified.

‘I was supposed to be going away for the weekend two hours later – the hotel was booked and paid for.

Fortunately Gem escaped without too many injuries, but Ms Silver faced possible surgery to clean out the infected wounds

Before and after: The wounds to Helena Silver's hand after she was attacked by a stray cat, and after treatment for the infection that caused her hand and wrist to swell to twice the size

‘They told me I could go home if I 
wanted to but said there was a risk of septicaemia which could prove 
fatal. In the circumstances I wasn’t going to take any chances.’

Miss Silver said she planned to 
distribute leaflets around her area warning neighbours about the cat. 
‘He’s the evil twin of my cat and he’s attacked my neighbour’s cat too 
and left her with a huge vets’ bill. When I went home before being 
admitted to hospital it was there sat on my doorstep.

‘I’ve no idea what he’s called, or who owns it, but people need to be told about him.

‘I don’t know whether he came in through my window looking for food or a fight but I wouldn’t like to meet him again.’

Last year Nora Scott, 80, was left 
looking like a mugging victim after she was attacked by a neighbour’s 
cat in Stoke-on-Trent. She suffered two black eyes and painful scratches
when the pet clawed at her face as she tended her garden.
