Nicholas T. Sheley had already killed two men when he murdered four people including a two-year-old boy

Petty criminal Nicholas Sheley was yesterday found guilty of four murders.

Sheley was convicted of the killings of his wife's ex-boyfriend Brock Branson,
his fiancée Kilynna Lee Blake, a month after her 20th birthday, and her 
two-year-old son, Dayan Kurtis and their flatmate.

Sheley had never got over the fact that his wife, Holly Gaul Shieley, had dated Mr Branson  and he went to the flat they shared with a hammer in his hand.

Their flatmate Kenneth Ulve, 25, was there alone, and Sheley killed him with a hammer. 

He then waited for Mr Branson, Miss Blake and Dayan, to come home whereupon he murdered them 
all with the hammer as revealed by a post mortem examination.

Sheley is already serving life sentences for the murders of 93-year-old Russell Reed and 65-year-old Ronald Randall.

Sheley killed Mr Reed on June 23, 2008 as he searched for money to buy cocaine and then hid his body in the boot of his car in Sterling, just across the Rock River about 110 miles west of Chicago, Illinois. Five days later, he murdered Mr Randall and stole his truck.

Two days later on June 30, Sheley went to the northwest Illinois home of 29-year-old Brock Branson. Mr Branson had had an affair with Sheley's wife Holly Gaul Sheley before her marriage to Sheley and could not come to terms with it.

Sheley
 was arrested on July 1, 2008 in a bar in Granite City, Illinois; earlier that 
day he had been to see a St Louis Cardinals baseball match.

Victims: Brock Branson, his fiancée Kilynna Blake and her son Dayan, two. Sheley believed that Mr Branson was seeing his estranged wife, Holly, and decided to exact his revenge. Miss Blake and Dayan were in the wrong place at the wrong time

The prosecution's case focused heavily on Sheley's DNA, which experts said was found in the apartment. Prosecutors also showed images of Sheley taken from security cameras in the days following the killings in which he wore clothing belonging to one of the victims.

After killing Mr Randall, Sheley went to see his estranged wife, Holly, at a friend's house and they went for a ride in the stolen truck.

At the trial Mrs Sheley testified: 'I felt like my butt was getting a little cold or a little wet. When we came underneath a street lamp, I had blood all over my hands. I started freaking out, but he just kept on driving.'

They stopped by a Holiday Inn in Rock Falls where Mrs Shelley used to work and took a walk by a nearby canal where, to ‘keep the peace’, she agreed to have sex.

Holly Sheley did not volunteer this information to police until her DNA was found on cigarettes in the truck a year later. She claimed that she was scared and was offered immunity for her testimony.Steve Nate, Assistant Attorney General said, ‘[Mr Branson] walked in that door and the defendant ambushed them, he hits them on the head and they go down on their hands and knees. They're on their hands and knees as the defendant is beating them over, and over.

‘Nicholas Sheley did this. Nicholas Sheley is the one responsible for these murders,’ Assistant Attorney General Nate said during his final argument. ‘Nicholas Sheley killed Brock. He killed Kye. He killed Dayan. And he killed Kenny.’

Jodi Fitzgerald, the sister of Brock Branson, celebrates as the verdict. 'I hope you rot in hell, Nick Sheley,' she screamed as Sheley was led from the courtroom

Sheley rocked back and forth in his chair as Judge Jeffrey O’Connor read the verdicts. Family members of the victims sobbed, wiped away tears and exchanged hugs to the judge's words.

‘I hope you rot in hell, Nick Sheley,’ Jodi Fitzgerald, the sister of Brock Branson, screamed as Sheley was led from the courtroom.

Sentencing in the Rock Falls killings is set for 11am on August 11. Illinois does not have the death penalty.

He next faces trial in the deaths of Jill and Tom Estes, a Sherwood, Arkansas, couple who were traveling in Missouri, where prosecutors can pursue the death penalty.
