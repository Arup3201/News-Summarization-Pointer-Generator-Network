After weeks of hiding out in the jungle, investigating an alleged setup, and tossing cell phones to throw off police, who can really blame him for swearing in front of the American public?

Eccentric fugitive millionaire software mogul John McAfee, who is on the run from police in Belize for questioning tied to the murder of his neighbour, dropped the f-bomb on live television Friday while explaining his dislike for local politicians.

‘I do not donate to any political party. When I was asked to donate, I said, “Get the f*** off my property,”’ McAfee, 67, said during a telephone interview with CNBC from ‘an undisclosed location.’

He then apologized to the cable network for his verbal slip-up, one of many recent gaffes.

McAfee was in the midst of recounting an incident earlier this month in which 42 armed Belizean officers allegedly stormed his compound, arrested him and detained him for 14 hours with no food or water, and then let him go without charges.

When CNBC reporter, Robert Frank, asked McAfee why he thought the police had done that, he said it was because he ‘does not play by the rules.’

McAfee said that he has donated millions of dollars to the local economy, including police departments and homeless agencies, but not through the Belizean government itself.

‘I don’t do it by giving to the government and letting them dole it out because if I give $5 million to the government, $10,000 goes to the people and $4 million plus change goes into the pockets of the politicians,’ he said. ‘I give directly to the people. And I have been doing this all along.’

McAfee, founder of the anti-virus software company that bears his last name, said he has been hiding out in the jungles of Belize and wearing disguises in public when he needs to purchase supplies.

He would not say what the disguises look like because he has ‘a feeling’ he will be wearing them again soon, he said.

The fugitive software mogul has been on the run from local police since November 11, the day after his American neighbour, Greg Faull, a 52-year-old contractor from Florida, was found shot in the head.

Two days before Faull's body was discovered, four of McAfee's dogs were poisoned to death, making McAfee a 'person of interest,' Belize authorities have said.

McAfee
says he is innocent and that he will not turn himself in. He has said 
on several occasions that he will be killed if he is taken into custody.

He has also said the he was set up by the Belizean government and that 
it all traces back to a bribe he didn't pay to a politician.

But he is certainly not shying away from reporters while hiding out.

Over the past three weeks he has given multiple media appearances, including two interviews with CNBC, an interview with The Daily Telegraph, an interview with ABC News, and an interview with Wired Magazine.

He also set up a blog, where he details his jungle adventures, his ongoing claims of government corruption, his thoughts about the highly addictive drug bath salts, and his own personal investigation into Faull’s murder.

A few days after the news of his hiding made headlines, McAfee logged onto the Internet to seek technical support on how phone tracking works, Gizmodo reported.

Not surprisingly, skeptics are disputing the validity of McAfee’s claims.

The fugitive software mogul told CNBC Friday that he is beginning to run out of money and is having trouble getting cash from his bank in Belize.

‘My life has been up and down from a comfort standpoint,’ he told CNBC.

McAfee said he has no plans to leave the
small Central American country bordered to the north by Mexico, to the south 
and west by Guatemala, and to the east by the Caribbean Sea.

‘This is my home,’ he said.

McAfee has not been formally charged with murder and is only wanted for questioning, according to Belize National Security Ministry spokesman Raphael Martinez.

The country’s prime minister Dean Barrow has called McAfee ‘extremely paranoid, even bonkers.’

McAfee, who relocated to Belize in 2008 after losing an estimated $96 million due to bad investments, founded his namesake software company in 1987, initially running it out of his home in California.

He sold his stake in McAfee Associates in 1994.

McAfee was employed as a programmer by NASA's Institute for Space Studies in New York City from 1968 to 1970. He has also worked for Xerox, Computer Sciences Corporation and Lockheed.

Update:

McAfee spoke with CNN on camera Saturday, his first on-camera appearance since he went into hiding more than three weeks ago.

He told the network he carries up to a dozen disposable cell phones at one time and estimates that he has gone through 200 phones over the past three weeks.

Rumors circulated across the web that McAfee had been caught by authorities after a cryptic message appeared on his blog shortly after his interview with CNN.

However, Belize national police confirmed to MailOnline on Sunday that the whereabouts of the millionaire software developer are still unknown.
