There have been times in Jose Mourinho’s career when he has shown what a sentimental old fool he can be. He is a romantic at heart.

This was the official homecoming for Didier Drogba, the first time Chelsea’s supporters have seen him in their Champions League jersey since that incredible night in the Allianz Arena.

After starting this game, he was blowing heavily for most of it in his struggle to recapture past glories. At 36, it is too much to ask.

Two years ago, when Chelsea went on to win the Champions League, Drogba was the main man. He was king in these parts, then.

That night, he summoned superhuman powers to score their equaliser against Bayern Munich in the 88th minute and went on to strike the winning penalty in the shootout.

On Wednesday night, as Chelsea fans heartily sang Diego Costa’s name after he was brought on with Loic Remy in an attempt to snatch victory, it felt like the endgame for Drogba.

Stamford Bridge had been willing him to score, but those legs could not carry him to the places his razor-sharp mind wanted to go. There were chances in each half as he attempted to add to the 34 Chelsea goals he has scored in this competition. The first was nicked off his toes for a corner. After the break, Eden Hazard, Chelsea’s outstanding player in an ordinary performance, set him clear of Schalke’s defence. He beat keeper Ralf Fahrmann, but rolled his effort wide.

Then there was the ‘Gazza moment’, sliding in like the England midfielder at Euro 96, when Willian crossed from the right. He, like Gascoigne, failed to connect.

‘I was happy with Drogba’s performance,’ insisted Mourinho. ‘One inch is nothing, that is all. He could have scored.’

To judge Drogba on one start would be ridiculous, but the fact Mourinho reached for Costa and Remy 17 minutes from time said it all.

Chelsea’s manager always looks out for his favourites.

When Inter Milan were 2-0 up with four minutes to play in the 2010 Champions League final, Mourinho sent on Marco Materazzi as a substitute. It was the Italian’s reward for his loyalty during Mourinho’s final season at San Siro.

This was another emotional decision by Mourinho ahead of Sunday’s game at Manchester City. Costa’s place for that is nailed on.

Drogba was on his own up front, ahead of the playground footballers — Hazard, Willian and Cesc Fabregas — who provide the attacking thrust. They have younger legs and danced around Schalke in a dizzy opening spell.

There were flashes from Drogba, the silky touches that once turned this guy into one of the dangerous strikers in Europe. The neat header to Fabregas, from a long ball by John Terry, was the Drogba of old. So was the backchat with Hazard, after he took the ball off his toes when he should have peeled off him.

When he was replaced by Costa, the chants were for the new man in town. Undeniably, they have replaced an old favourite here.
