A woman so badly burnt as a child that she wanted to end her life says her baby son has given her a renewed sense of purpose and happiness.

Nikita Cummings, now 20, suffered third degree burns to 80 per cent of her body when her nightdress caught fire when she was nine years old.  

Miss Cummings had been burning off a stray thread when her nylon nightdress went up in flames, and she was so badly burnt the skin on her hand melted down to the bone.

She was rushed to hospital where she was put into a  coma for seven weeks, while medics took skin grafts taken from her leg to repair the burnt left side of her body.

Doctors managed to save her life, but when she woke up and saw her reflection in the mirror she said she wished she was dead.

Nikita Cummings, now 20, suffered horrific burns as a nine-year-old when she accidentally set her nightdress on fire when trying to burn away a loose thread. She was put into a medical coma for seven weeks 

Miss Cummings was put into a medical coma for seven weeks while doctors tried to save her life. The skin on her hand had melted through to the bone and she needed multiple skin grafts for the left side of her body, which was completely burnt

 When she woke up from the coma, Miss Cummings looked in the mirror and said 'I want to die'. She became accidentally pregnant, and says her son Carsyn, now 17 months, has made her appreciate her life again. 'I feel like the luckiest mum in the world' she says

After years of wearing compression pads, and being stared at in the street, she thought she would never get married and have a family.

But while she still hasn't found love, an accidental pregnancy means she now has a 17-month-old boy, Carsyn, whose birth has made her appreciate her life again.

Miss Cummings, of Greenock, Scotland, said: 'I thought it was something that would never happen to me but Carsyn has given me a new lease of life.

'I feel like the luckiest mum in the world.'

She recalls that it was July 2004 when she lit a stray thread on her night dress

She recalled in July 2004 lighting a stray thread on her nightdress, which led to her whole body going up in flames.

She said: 'We were meant to be going on a family camping trip that day and I'd woken up really excited before anyone else.

'I spotted the lighter on the coffee table in the lounge and just lit it to burn off the thread.

'The next thing I was surrounded by flames and I started screaming.'

She wore compression pads, a face mask and gloves for two years to help her skin heal while her friends didn't treat her differently and she wasn't teased at school, she believed she looked 'horrible'. She is pictured in 2012 having an operation on the skin on her chest

Miss Cummings (pictured left and right) said her friends didn't treat her differently, but people in the street stared at her scars. She got changed for P.E. in a different room so she didn't have to endure girls staring

Her parents, Anne and John, called an ambulance and she was rushed to Inverclyde Royal Hospital.

From there she was transferred to the burns unit at Yorkhill Hospital, Glasgow, and put in a medical coma for seven weeks to let her injuries heal.

She said: 'I had no idea where I was.

'Mum and dad told me surgeons had taken skin grafts from my right leg to repair my face, neck, upper body, left arm, left leg and tummy.

Third degree, or full thickness burns, are where all three layers of skin (the epidermis, dermis and subcutis) are damaged. 

In this type of burn, the skin is often burnt away and the tissue underneath may appear pale or blackened. 

The remaining skin will be dry and white, brown or black with no blisters. 

The texture of the skin may also be leathery or waxy.

'The skin on my left hand had melted through to the bone and doctors had warned them I could lose my finger, but they managed to save it.'

After she was wokem up from the coma, it took her three months to work up the courage to look in a mirror.  

'I told my dad I wanted to die,' she said.

'It was so red and raw. I felt horrible.'

When she left hospital she had to become used to strangers staring.

'Thankfully, when I went back to school, I didn't get teased but I still hated my reflection,' she said.

'My life had changed forever. I wore pressure garments under my clothes for two years and a face mask and gloves to protect my skin.

'Once the garments came off, my skin did look smoother but without them, my scars were more visible.

'I couldn't bear the other girls staring at me so I changed for PE in a different room.

'My best friends didn't treat me any differently, but that didn't change how I felt about myself.

Miss Cummings had started a college course in nursing but after she missed her period and realised she was pregnant. Now she calls her son Carsyn her 'little miracle'

Carsyn has given Miss Cummings a new purpose, she said: 'Before, I used to be down in the dumps a lot but Carsyn has made me realise what life is all about'

'It took me four years to feel brave enough to go out shopping with them.'

She began a college course in nursing but after she missed her period, realised she was pregnant.

The idea of having let alone a baby seemed like a distant dream.

'It wasn't something I'd ever thought would happen,' Miss Cummings said.

'It was massive. I was living in my own flat but my mum helped. She's been amazing.'

Miss Cummings's pregnancy was closely monitored due to the scarring on her stomach, left after her burns.

She was induced a week before her due date as her skin would not stretch any further.

The birth of her son has given her a new lease of happiness.

'Before, I used to be down in the dumps a lot but Carsyn has made me realise what life is all about,' she said.

'He doesn't see my scars and I am bringing him up not to stare at people like some children do.

'All is he sees when he looks at me is his mummy who loves him.

'I see a miracle I never thought I'd get. I feel blessed.'
