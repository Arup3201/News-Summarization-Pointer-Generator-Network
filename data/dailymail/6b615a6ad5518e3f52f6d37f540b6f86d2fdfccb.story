Just enjoyed a 'Diet Coke' break? You'll be pleased to hear that you won't need to do any exercise to work off that fizzy drink.  However, according to a newly launched exercise calculator you'll need to go for a half-hour brisk walk if you want to work off the calories from a standard 330ml can.

The Work It Out Calculator has been launched by the Coca-Cola company and matches all of its popular drinks with how long it would take to burn the calories off through various forms of exercise.

So while a 144 calorie can of Sprite could be worked off in an 18 minute Zumba class, it would take 47 minutes of ballroom dancing, or - if you could face it - 73 minutes of ironing.

Helpful advice or cynical PR ploy? The Coca-Cola calculator lists calories but not the sugar content of each drink

It reveals that 'healthier' vitamin drinks such as Glaceau Vitamin Water Essential would still require a 13minute cycle ride or vacuuming for 19 minutes.

But if household chores fill you with
dread, Coca-Cola reminds readers that: 'Great music can put the fun 
into vacuuming. Crank up a fast-paced tune and burn some calories while 
you clean!'

The 
calculator also doesn't mention just how much sugar is in it's 'full-fat
products'.

A can of coke contains 39g or nine teaspoons of sugar, which
is close to half of a woman's recommended daily allowance of 90g.

A can of Diet Coke contains 0.5 calories so doesn't require exercise to work off, however normal Coca-Cola is a different matter (see table above right)

The company launched the calculator after it commissioned a survey that revealed over a third of Britons admit they don't have the time to be as active as they like, with motivation (32 per cent) cited as a key barrier.

Coca-Cola GB said: 'We want to help 
people understand how they can enjoy our drinks as part of a healthful 
balanced diet, whilst communicating the importance of an active 
lifestyle.'

The move will be seen by many as a cynical PR stunt to promote Coca-Cola as a healthy-brand.

However, many will doubtless be keen to learn how much jogging they need to do tonight after downing a can of Fanta (12 minutes, in case you're wondering).

The company has faced criticism in the past for not responding to health concerns. In June, UK campaigners called for a ban on a colouring linked to cancer which has been found in Coca-Cola sold in Britain.

Glaceau Vitamin Water can be worked off doing chores

Coca-Cola
has recently switched to a new manufacturing process in America to 
bring down the level of the chemical, 4-methylimidazole (4-MI), which gives coke its distinctive colour.

But this precaution has not yet been 
taken in other countries such as Britain, where product sales top £1.1billion a year.

Health authorities in California are so 
concerned that they have passed a law that requires any can of drink 
containing a 4-MI reading of 30mcg or more to carry a health warning. If
this safety assessment was applied in Britain, all cans of Coke would 
have to carry a warning.

Coca-Cola strenuously denies there is any human health risk from 4-MI.
