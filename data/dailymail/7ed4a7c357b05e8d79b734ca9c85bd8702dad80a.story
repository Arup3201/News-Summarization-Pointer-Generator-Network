Dizzying heights: A window washer fell 11 stories from the roof of the Sterling Bank & Trust building in San Francisco, but his fall was slightly cushioned by a passing Camry

As the man plunged toward the street, a Toyota Camry was driving past, and the man landed on its roof, shattering the back windows.

Mashable reports driver Mohammad Alcozai was unharmed even though the fall destroyed the car's windshield and collapsed in the roof. 

Alcozai told reporters he was praying for the man, The Indiana Gazette reports.

'I'm very happy that I wasn't hurt,' he said. 'Hopefully he can make it. I pray for him that he can make it.' 

Sam Hartwell says he saw the man fall as he passed through the intersection.

'I was actually looking in the direction of where the fellow fell off the building,' he said. 'I saw something blue out of the corner of my eye falling and then I heard the loud thud and the shattering of the back of the car.'

A group of bystanders ran towards the scene, with some helping to direct traffic while others administered aid and called 911.

'Everyone did the right thing, we didn’t disrupt the integrity of the spinal cord,' Hartwell said. 'We covered him with clothing. He was obviously in shock' 

According to Hartwell, the man was breathing and lucid in one eye, though he was bleeding from the ears.

Damage: Bystanders came to help the man, who was lucid but bleeding from the ears, by covering him and calling 911

Critical: The man was transported to San Francisco General Hospital with serious injuries after landing on the car, as this tweet from Chuck Reynolds shows

The man was taken to San Francisco General Hospital in critical condition, but the Alcozai emerged unharmed.

Sgt Danielle Newman of the San Francisco Police Department said hitting the car was a small bit of luck for the man, as it slightly cushioned his fall.
