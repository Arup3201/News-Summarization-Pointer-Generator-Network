These images capture the heartwarming moment a soldier arrived home from  Afghanistan - and proposed to his sweetheart as he stepped off the train.

Romantic Martin Rogers got down on one knee at Wakefield Westgate station, West  Yorkshire, as he returned home from a five-month tour of duty with the Royal  Signals.

Dressed in full military gear, he threw his military kit bags down on the  platform and popped the question to delighted girlfriend Zoe - who of course  said yes.

Martin's mother Tracey, as well as Zoe's five-year-old Xander (her child by a previous relationship) were on hand to witness the  joyful scene as surprised passengers and staff captured the moment on their  mobile phones.

Tracey said: 'Coming home was a special moment for them both after Martin's  five months away and he thought it would be the ideal time to propose.

'I kept a safe hold of the engagement ring just to make sure it didn't get lost  in all of the excitement! We're all so happy and looking forward to the  wedding.'

Martin returns to Afghanistan in two weeks' time to complete his tour of duty  before another emotional return to Wakefield Westgate in June.

The happy couple  will then begin to 
plan a date for their wedding. East Coast Customer Service Assistant 
Neal McNulty was on the platform and took  the photos of Martin's 
romantic proposal.

Neal said: 'It was the best thing I've ever seen on the station - a real tear-jerker.

'Martin gave the little lad a big cuddle when he got off the train, then got down on one knee 
and proposed.

'There was hardly a dry eye in the house when she said yes.'

East Coast Social Media Manager Nick Wood said: 'Interest in the pictures and  Martin and Zoe's proposal is immense.

'We're receiving lots of messages saying  what a lovely moment it was - the most romantic thing on the railway since  Brief Encounter.

'Wakefield Westgate is our newest station, having only been open for eight  weeks. Martin and Zoe have brought a touch of romance to the rails and everyone  here is delighted for them.'
