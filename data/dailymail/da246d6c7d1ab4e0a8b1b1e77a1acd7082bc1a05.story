British musicians claimed all of the top 10 best-selling albums of 2014, squeezing American artists out of the chart for the first time. 

Ed Sheeran led the list of the acts, with his most recent album, X, selling 1.7million times online and in stores. 

Sales were remarkably higher than in 2013 when no single act sold more than 1million albums.

Sam Smith sold the second highest number of albums (1.25million) with his In the Lonely Hour this year, followed by George Ezra, Paolo Nutini and Coldplay. 

One Direction, who topped last year's list after selling 685,000 copies of Midnight Memories, were seventh this year with their album Four. 

Olly Murs, Pink Floyd and Take That finished off the top 10, with Paloma Faith the only woman to appear in the list at number six.  

For the first time this year physical albums accounted for less than half of the total sales, with online transactions making up 51 per cent of the figures. 

Streaming music has also become more popular, with subscriptions to websites such as Spotify and Deezer contributing £14.8bmillion to the industry. 

Paloma Faith was the only female artist to be included in the top 10. George Ezra sold the third highest number of albums with his Wanted On Voyage

One Direction topped last year's list of the highest selling albums, but was seventh in the 2014 chart

While CD sales decreased by eight per cent, the revival of the vinyl disc saw the largest number of records sold in one year since 1995.

2. Sam Smith - In The Lonely Hour

The Frozen soundtrack was the second highest selling album by various artists, with more than 900,000 records purchased.  

Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry, said: 'The remarkable success of British artists in 2014 is exciting news for the future. 

'Our record labels are backing home-grown talent like Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and George Ezra, who in turn are catching fire around the world.'

Tony Wadsworth, the outgoing chairman of the BPI, added: 'The UK recorded music industry invests in a truly global business, as labels continue to find, develop, support and succeed with world class artists making world-class music.'
