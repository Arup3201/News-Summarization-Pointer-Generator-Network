Killed: Aya Hadir Ghais, who was in the UAE to study, died after the high-powered Lamborghini she was driving crashed and caught fire

An American teenage student has died after the Lamborghini she was driving crashed and caught fire in Abu Dhabi.

Authorities in the United Arab Emirate's capital said that Aya Hadir Ghais, 19, was travelling in the high-powered vehicle alone when the horrific accident happened on Saturday.

Despite firefighters arriving on the scene in Defence Road within four minutes and extinguishing the fire, she could not be freed in time.

The teenager, who friends say dreamed of one day being a mother, had been married for two years.

Her Lebanese husband Makram Ghais flew to his home country on Sunday with her body to prepare for the funeral.

The couple married when Aya was 17 and she took up her studies at the Paris Sorbonne University in Abu Dhabi when he moved there to work for a UAE-based company.

Aya is the eldest sibling to a sister, Sarah, 18, and two brothers, all of whom live with her parents in Lebanon.

Speaking to The National,
Captain Abdullah Al Tamimi, from Abu Dhabi Civil Defence, said: 'She 
must have been driving too fast. Her car hit the kerb, overturned and 
caught fire.'

Mrs Ghais was studying law and economics at and was extremely popular.

On Monday around 100 of the teenager's grieving friends held a memorial walk for Aya, where they recited verses from the Quran, read poetry, carried candles and roses and released white balloons in memory of their friend.

'She was always cheerful, very dedicated and hardworking. She was on her way to the campus library on Saturday when the incident happened,' said Ruba Obaid, a 20-year-old student of economics at the university.

'We used to see each other every day in university. She was always happy, always smiling and I am sure she never, ever hurt anyone.

'If she saw anyone crying, whether she knew that person or not, she would go ahead and help them,” said Rama Hattab, an 18-year-old student who was also Aya’s roommate during a ski trip.

Rama said it was only the second time she had driven the powerful car.

'It was her second time to ride this 
car which came for her from Lebanon. I thank God that she died instantly
at the crash and did not suffer for long,' she said.

Ms
Ghais crashed on a bridge entering Al Reem Island, described as a 'chic
urban metropolis' of shopping, hotels and luxurious homes.

Memorial walk organiser, Issam Kabbara, told 7 Days in Dubai that he hopes the walk will become an annual event to remember Aya and others killed in road traffic accidents.

'I had a crash when the same bridge was being built. My car turned over on its roof and was written off.

'I
know how dangerous it can be. Be remembering our friend Aya, we can 
also highlight road safety too,' said Kabbara, a Romanian-Lebanese 
student.

He described her 
as 'a wonderful person who always had a smile for everyone and who was 
really admired'. He knew her when he trained the university women’s 
football team when Aya was a member.

'She played football very well, she played basketball and she was a great student,' he added.

Dr Fabien Chareix, its deputy vice-chancellor for academic affairs said the Lebanese-American was a serious and focused 
student.

Fun-loving: She was described as a serious student who was very committed to her studies

'Some students, they keep quiet and don’t make themselves 
known, but she was a pleasure to have in class,' he said.

An investigation into the tragedy is 
now taking place by Abu Dhabi Police. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy 
said officials would offer assistance to the girl's family.

The
U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced last 
month that all Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe and Spyder models built in 
2004 - 06 would be recalled over a potential fire risk.

It
affected a total of 1,491 vehicles. Police officers leading the 
investigation in Abu Dhabi did not confirm which model of the car Miss 
Ghais was driving at the time of her death.
