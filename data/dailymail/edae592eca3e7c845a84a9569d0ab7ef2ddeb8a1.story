Nicky Campbell has revealed how he was left ‘extremely upset’ when  litter louts spat on him  outside his home.

The Radio 5 Live Breakfast host was verbally abused and ‘showered’ with spit when he confronted the gang of yobs for ripping open bin bags and kicking rubbish all over his street.

Speaking for the first time about the emotional impact of the attack in Clapham, south London, he said he had to be comforted afterwards by his wife Tina.

Nicky Campbell has revealed how he was left 'extremely upset' when litter louts spat on him  outside his home

‘I asked them very politely to put [the litter] in a bin and they covered me in spittle all over my hair,’ he told this week’s Radio Times.

‘I walked back home and then I went upstairs and had a shower and lay on the bed.

‘I called Tina and she came up and I talked to her about it and I was extremely upset.

‘You are only trying to do the right thing and then someone covers you in spit. I didn’t feel good about it at all.’

The former Watchdog presenter, 53, said his wife was angry when he told her about the incident ‘because I have a tendency to remonstrate with people’ but he added that he did not regret his actions and would probably do the same again.

Although the incident occurred in 2011, it appears from Mr Campbell’s comments that it has had a lasting impact and remains in the forefront of his mind.

Speaking shortly after it happened he told listeners of his BBC radio show: ‘I was going for a run and there were these kids – who were aged about 14 or 15.

‘And they had kicked open a bin bag and they were spreading the litter everywhere.

‘I remonstrated with them and they showered me with gob – all of them. It was unpleasant.’ His shocked co-presenter Rachel Burden, said: ‘What, they spat at you?’

Mr Campbell went on to clarify: ‘Yes, and they were very insulting and abusive.’

The shocking encounter happened just weeks after the father of four found himself having to chase a burglar from his property.

After being alerted by the family’s golden Labrador, Maxwell, he jumped out of bed naked at 5am to confront the thief who was trying to steal his £600 bike from the garden.

At the time Mr Campbell said: ‘I ran downstairs, opened the back door and flew out with Maxwell beside me.

Former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has also revealed that he likes to regularly challenge people if he spots them dropping rubbish

‘My body parts were dangling in the wind. I just wanted to get him. I was pumping with adrenaline.’

However the burglar fled the property empty-handed. ‘If I’d caught him I don’t know what I’d have done – probably hit him,’ Mr Campbell added.

‘Or maybe I would have tried to sit on him naked until the police arrived – that would have traumatised him for life.

‘Something primordial took over and I didn’t think about anything other than grabbing him. It never even crossed my mind that he could have had a knife.’

Mr Campbell is not the only BBC host to take on litter louts. His hero, the former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman – whom he describes as an ‘interviewer nonpareil’ – has also revealed that he likes to regularly challenge people if he spots them dropping rubbish.

However Mr Paxman seems to have had slightly better experiences confronting people who have thrown litter on the streets.

Discussing his take on the problem, he said: ‘I find when you confront people and say “excuse me, you just dropped this”, then nine times out of ten – you might be unlucky on the tenth one – but nine times out of ten they will say “oh, sorry,” and take the rubbish away.’
