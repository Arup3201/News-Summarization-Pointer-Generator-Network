Paul Caine is one of just 350 men who are diagnosed with breast cancer every year

When Paul Caine was diagnosed with breast cancer, he turned to his friends for support.

But the 50-year-old was left struggling to convince them he was will - because none of them believed he could be suffering with the disease.

While the disease predominantly affects women - nearly 50,000 are diagnosed every year - Mr Caine is one of 350 men who are diagnosed with the condition every year in the UK.

But he says he had to convince his 
friends hwe actually had the disease - which they thought only affected women - with the landlord of his local pub accusing him of 'taking the mickey’.

Mr Caine, from Bolton, found a lump in his left breast when he was in the shower last May.

He said: 'I was having a 
shower when I felt a lump. I thought it was a cyst as I had never heard 
of breast cancer in men'

But his concerned doctor referred him to hospital,

Mr Caine, who has a 16-year-old daughter, Grace, had to undergo exactly the same diagnosis procedures as women. He had a

'Having cancer gives you a different perspective on 
life. It makes you think about life and your health more. I had never 
thought about cancer before.'

He underwent surgery to remove the cancerous growth before undergoing a gruelling course of chemotherapy. His radiotherapy treatment will start later this month.

Mr Caine is now urging other men to make sure they check themselves and be aware of the risk of breast cancer.

Symptoms can include changes in the 
breast shape or size, a nipple turning in, bleeding or discharge from 
the nipple, a swelling or lump in the armpit or an ulcer on the skin of 
the breast.

Male breast cancer is usually 
easier to spot because a lump in man's breast is very apparent. Women 
are 100 times more likely to be diagnosed with 
breast cancer than men.

He said: 'The majority of men I have talked to think as I did, that it’s only women that get breast cancer.

'A
lot of people I have told have said, "No, men can’t get breast cancer",
and I say "I can assure you they can, because I have got it".'

Geoff Thompson, the landlord at his 
local paper explained: 'When I heard Paul had breast cancer I gave the 
same reaction as other men - I thought he was taking the mickey.'

Risk factors for breast cancer in men
are not fully understood but it is thought the chances increase with 
age, if there is a family history of breast cancer, if men are exposed 
to high levels of radiation, are overweight or drink heavily over a 
sustained period.

Symptoms 
can include changes in the breast shape or size, a nipple turning in, 
bleeding or discharge from the nipple, a swelling or lump in the armpit 
or an ulcer on the skin of the breast.

Male breast cancer is usually easier to spot because a lump in man's breast is very apparent. Women are 100 times more likely to be diagnosed with 
breast cancer than men.

The
youngest man to be diagnosed with breast cancer in Britain is Nicky 
Avery, from Southend in Essex, who was told he had the condition when he
was just 24-years-old.

He initially beat the breast cancer but died at the age of 28 after it returned in his liver and bones.
