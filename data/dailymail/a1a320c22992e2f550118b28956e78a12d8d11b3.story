Fake: Sneha Mashru, pictured right, best friend of Anni Dewani, left, told the court the Dewanis were pretending to be in love

Shrien and Anni Dewani pretended to be in love at their lavish Indian wedding, Anni's best friend and cousin this morning told Dewani's murder trial.

'Anni told me that Shrien and her had decided to act for the wedding', Sneha Mashru told Shrien Dewani's South African murder trial.

'She said "Sneha, do we look happy together?" because me and Shrien - we are acting'. 

The revelation came as Sneha Mashru - Anni's best friend - was asked about the previous day's witness testimony in which she laid out her suspicions Anni's husband.

Sneha disputed the defence's suggestion that she may not have known everything about her best friend's life - and rejected as misleading a doctor's medical record which shows how Anni and Shrien had been trying for a baby.

'If Anni was trying to fall pregnant then she would have told me', Sneha - who is Anni's paternal cousin - told Shrien Dewani's murder trial

'Also I know for a fact that Shrien and Anni's sex life was not good because Shrien was having problems getting an erection.'

Anni Dewani was shot dead on her honeymoon on the evening of 13th November, 2010 when the taxi she and her husband Shrien were travelling in was hijacked as it passed through the dangerous Cape Town township of Gugulethu.

While four South Africans - including the taxi's driver - have so far been convicted of carrying out the hijack, the country's police force has accused Shrien Dewani, a businessman from Bristol, of arranging and paying for his wife's murder.

Dewani denies the allegation.

Giving witness evidence for a second day, Sneha Mashru was challenged on her claims that Dewani had acted 'strangely' on his return from South Africa.

'I expected him to behave more grieving', Sneha told the court. 'I wanted to see the sadness in him. I couldn't see the love.'

Dewani's lawyer, Francois van Zyl, countered that Shrien Dewani will not deny that he is a 'perfectionist, calculating, controlling' person.

Testimony: Swedish Mrs Mashru told Cape Town's high court that she knew the Dewanis' sex life was not good because Shrien was having problems getting an erection

Dewanis' actions, his lawyer said, "are in keeping with his perfectionist traits". Sneha Mashru did not demure.

Cape Town's High Court also heard this morning from Sgt Cornelius Mellet, one of the first police officers to talk to Mr Dewani after the hijack.

Sgt. Mellet said he had been surprised to notice that Shrien Dewani's 'appearance was clean' after the November 2010 incident.

'In my experience [...] this person was someone who was in a robbery, but without a struggle taking place', Sgt. Mellet told the court.

Cold: Anni's best friend, Mrs Mashru told the court yesterday that she did not feel Dewani grieved

Asked to elaborate, the policeman said: 'I am a married man who has been married for many years and I would have been very worried if my wife has disappeared.

'It was strange for me that Mr Dewani did not enquire what the police were doing within their powers to get hold his wife.'

Under cross examination, however, Sgt. Mellet confirmed that he did not provide the detectives investigating Anni's murder with this information until almost a year after Anni's murder.

Mellet's first official statement on his interaction with Mr Dewani, it was revealed today, was taken on the 12 October 2012 - just under eleven months after Anni's death,

Furthermore, Sgt. Mellet conceded that he had no written notes of Dewani's allegedly suspicious words or actions - and that the only notes he does have contain no reference to Dewani having acted strangely at all.

The case continues.
