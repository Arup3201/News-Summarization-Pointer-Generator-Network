Manchester United have added Tottenham's Kyle Walker to their list of potential defensive targets for the summer.

The 24-year-old has four years left on contract and recently returned from nine months out with a pelvic injury.

Walker has already shown glimpses of the form that earned him recognition with England and United are monitoring his performances.

Tottenham would be reluctant to sell and would demand at least £20million.

Manchester United have also considered Nathaniel Clyne at Southampton and Everton's Seamus Coleman while Dani Alves of Barcelona has been offered as he has yet to agree new terms and is free in the summer.

But it remains to be seen if Louis van Gaal can be enticed into pouncing upon another cheap arrival from the Nou Camp, after signing goalkeeper Victor Valdes in January, who was out of contract having departed Barcelona last summer.

The United boss wants a right-back, centre-back, midfielder, a winger and a striker to bolster his squad in the summer.

He had been strongly linked with Southampton's Clyne, who has enjoyed another impressive season on the south coast under Ronald Koeman and has even broken into the England squad.

But Walker's resurgence under Mauricio Pochettino after returning from injury has impressed the United manager.

And Van Gaal clearly wants a stronger option than 19-year-old Paddy McNair, who has been deputising ahead of Rafael in recent matches.

Van Gaal will be hoping he can lead his side to a convincing victory over Swansea at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday.

Swansea inflicted a 2-1 defeat upon the 63-year-old at Old Trafford in his first game as United boss in August and he will look to avenge the scoreline with three points that would strengthen his team's place in the top four of the league.
