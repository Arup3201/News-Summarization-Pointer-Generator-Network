A spurned boyfriend who posted naked pictures of his ex-girlfriend on the internet is thought to be the first person jailed for ‘revenge porn’, it emerged yesterday.

Liam King, 21, was sent intimate pictures by the woman during their three-year on-off relationship.

But she went to police after he posted several of the images on social media sites, together with offensive comments, following the breakdown of their affair.

Jailed: Luke King was sent a number of intimate photographs by the victim during an on-off relationship that lasted three years. He uploaded one of them to online messaging service WhatsApp in August

The case comes just weeks after Justice Secretary Chris Grayling vowed to clamp down on revenge porn. He announced it would become a criminal offence, with a maximum jail term of two years.

Jailing King for 12 weeks, District Judge Andrew Davison said his actions were ‘pernicious’ and designed to cause ‘maximum humiliation’ to the victim, whose identity was protected by the court. 

‘You should be thoroughly ashamed of this offence,’ the judge said. ‘I regard this as despicable and a significant breach of trust.’

On August 8 this year, King replaced his profile picture on the internet messaging service WhatsApp with an explicit image of his ex, Southern Derbyshire Magistrates’ Court was told.

The victim, who lives in Derby, told police: ‘It disgusted and really upset me.’ 

She had already contacted police over her ex-boyfriend’s abusive behaviour. 

King was eventually prosecuted under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 after he ignored two police warnings not to share the X-rated images.

He pleaded guilty to harassment and another charge of failing to answer police bail.

Alison Wright, prosecuting, said: ‘She (the victim) called police to report that he had threatened to put explicit photographs of her on the internet. She accepted she sent them initially to him but they were for his eyes only.’

James Close, defending, said King agreed his behaviour was ‘unacceptable’.

Last month the Government announced that the distribution of ‘revenge porn’ was to become a criminal offence as part of an amendment to the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament.

At the time, Mr Grayling said: ‘We want those who fall victim to this type of disgusting behaviour to know that we are on their side and will do everything we can to bring offenders to justice.’

East Midlands district crown prosecutor Peter Shergill said: ‘Prosecutors are now following guidance … that clarifies how we can use existing legislation to prosecute perpetrators of these intrusive offences.’ 

Those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws.

It will be made a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. 

It will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be caught by the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message. 

Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught.

Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet.

Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images.

The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions.

However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages.
