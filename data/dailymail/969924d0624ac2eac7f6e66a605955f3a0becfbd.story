A budding 16-year-old fashion designer says the Oakland A's  stole his 'stOAKed' logo and used it to sell t-shirts for the baseball team. 

Ryan Frigo, a proud Oakland native, says he created the logo more than two years ago as part of a high school design class. He's been selling t-shirts, hoodies, beanies and other products with the design ever since. 

'I created this company to combat negative perceptions and promote Oakland in my freshman year at Oakland Tech,' Mr Frigo told KNTV. 

Ryan Frigo says he designed the 'stoaked' logo in 2012 to help foster pride his native city of Oakland, California

The A's started selling their own 'stoaked' shirts last month - though the team has since pulled the merchandise from its online store 

Mr Frigo, pictured, says the A's either deliberately stole his idea or thought they could get away with taking his design because he's just a teenager

Last month, the Atheltics online store began offering t-shirts that said 'STOAKED'  - printing the 'oak' in the world in Athletics yellow. The shirts were meant to celebrate the teams' post-season run last season. 

After Mr Frigo's story was picked up by local news media, the company that manufactures the shirt, Majestic, announced it would stop selling the shirts 'as a gesture of goodwill.' 

Since 2012, Mr Frigo has been selling his 'STOAKED' clothing that similarly emphasized the 'oak' in the word. 

He does not have a trademark on his clothing because the word 'stoked' had already been trademarked by someone.

Mr Frigo argues that he has a 'common law trademark,' however, because he has been using the term for years. 

He thinks that A's willfully disregarded his prior use of the term. 

'Maybe, they saw it was an Oakland youth who doesn't have a huge corporation like them and said, "Oh we can probably get away with using it,"' he told the East Bay Express. 

On his blog, he wrote: 'Even if it was a coincidence, any professional is expected to, at the least, Google "stoaked." If they had done so, this website would have come up first. Either they directly stole from stOAKed, did not bother to do a second's research, or did not think twice about infringing on the company.'
