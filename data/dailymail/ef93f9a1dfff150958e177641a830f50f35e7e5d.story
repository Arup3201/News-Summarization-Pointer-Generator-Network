A crafty tenant in a New York City apartment has figured out an ingenious scheme to keep her hands on the oft-sought gem of the New York real estate market: The coveted rent-controlled apartment.

At 63 years old, Pamela Becker - who now calls herself 'Maria DeTommaso' - had herself legally adopted by an elderly retired dock worker so his $100-a-month, rent-controlled, two-bedroom apartment in the up-and-coming neighborhood of Long Island City, Queens, would go to her, the man's 'daughter.'

Becker now is battling the couple who owns the building - who claim she has no right to live in the apartment at its rent-controlled price - in Queens Housing Court over whether she has any right to the apartment.

'She has made my life a living hell,' Sugrim Outar, who owns the 
small apartment building with his wife, said on the witness stand during a court hearing last week, the New York Post reports.

According to the paper, Becker first came to the apartment building in the 1990s as a cat-sitter for a tenant.

At some point, the former yoga instructor befriended DeTommaso - and she latched on.

Neighbors say Becker would often take the old man shopping and spend time with him. Soon after, he started giving her gifts - including a 'series of cars.'

By 2002, Becker had officially moved in with the older man, who in 2007 was diagnosed with dementia, at which point Becker was granted power of attorney for the ailing former dock worker.

As the person in charge of making all of his financial and legal decisions, Becker became the beneficiary of his life insurance policy and his pension.

However, she refused to marry him.

'Some people said I should marry him. I didn't want to marry him, that's
 gross. I don't do stuff like that,' Becker told the Post.Â 

Rather, Becker had herself legally adopted by DeTommaso just weeks before his June 2009 death.

Since DeTommaso's death, Becker has continued to live in the apartment - and pay the $100-a-month rent.

Long Island City's proximity to Manhattan - one subway stop from Grand Central Station in midtown - as well as the construction of a collection of luxury high-rise apartment buildings over the last decade has rental prices in the area far higher than the $100-a-month Becker currently is paying to live in her 'father's' rent controlled apartment.

In 2013, the average price for a two-bedroom apartment in the emerging neighborhood was about $3,000. And that was after a $50-a-month increase from the previous year.

The Outars were forced to withdraw their lawsuit against Becker due to technical issues. Sugrim Outar, however, says he plans to try and have Becker evicted from his property.

'I'm legally adopted,' Becker told the Post. 'I'm going to win this battle.'
