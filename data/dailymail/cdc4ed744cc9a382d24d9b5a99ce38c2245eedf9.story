A schoolboy got one 'shell' of a shock when his pet bearded dragons laid 91 eggs and they all hatched.

Ben Whittaker, from Royston, near Barnsley, had been trying to breed bearded dragons, Brian, Izzy and Bella over the summer.

But the nine-year-old was 'surprised' to find the two females had laid so many eggs - and he was even more shocked when they all hatched.

Family: Bearded dragons Brian, Izzy and Bella bred 91 baby lizards over the summer

He said: 'I don't think mum will let me breed them anymore.'

It is costing Ben's parents, Joanne and Wayne, about Â£6 per day to feed all 94 animals - which mostly eat grass, lettuce and mealworms.

They are now trying to sell the offspring but the lizards cannot be re-homed until they reach six weeks old.

Mrs Whittaker said: 'We were really shocked when they started hatching.

'We'd seen all the eggs but didn't get our hopes up.

'We woke Ben up when the first twelve hatched and it just snowballed from there.'

The reptiles, which can grow up to a foot long, are not known usually known to give birth to such high numbers

Ben said he doesn't think his mother will let him breed them again

The reptiles, which can grow up to about a foot long, are not usually known to give birth to such high numbers.

Steve Ellis, of Aqua Inn pet shop, Barnsley, said: 'The amount of eggs a bearded dragon produces does vary from animal to animal.

'In our shop we've had a few that have laid eggs but never quite as many as that.'
