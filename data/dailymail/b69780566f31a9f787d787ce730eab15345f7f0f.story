This is the horrific state of a family home left gutted by flames after an e-cigarette exploded while it was charging, killing the neighbour's cat.

Victoria Newton, 34, and her three children are 'lucky to be alive' according to fire crews but have now been left homeless.

It is the latest in a series of incidents across the country caused by the devices, sparking calls for 
tighter safety measures on the new trend.

Devastated: Victoria Newton and her children (left-right) Dylan Thomas-James, Millie Anne James, and Lauren James, have been left homeless after an e-cigarette exploded in their house, engulfing it in flames

Gutted: The entire house in Leigh, Greater Manchester, has been destroyed, leaving the family homeless

Ms Newton was at home with her four-year-old son Dylan and her two daughters Millie-Anne, nine, and Lauren, 13, when they heard a bang and the house in Leigh, Greater Manchester, became engulfed in flames.

She said: 'It was a nightmare. My daughter Lauren had some friends round and one of her mates had plugged in her e-cigarette and they'd gone out playing.

'About 15 minutes later, I was doing housework and I heard this crackling noise coming from Lauren's bedroom.

'I didn't know what it was and when I reached the landing I just remember this huge bang and I was thrown to the floor by the force of it.

'It had been left on the floor and the explosion sent it flying across the room and it ended up under Lauren's bed.

Horror: Just a few of their possessions escaped the blaze, which fire fighters said the family was lucky to survive

Escape: Ms Newton grabbed Dylan, four, as she fled the house after hearing an enormous bang upstairs

Ashen: Even the floorboards have given way after flames crashed through the windows and ceilings

'I was crawling around and when I looked I couldn't believe my eyes. There was smoke everywhere and the room was on fire.

'The force of the blast had blown out all the bedroom windows and blown the door off the hinges.

'I couldn't breathe and my instinct was just to grab Dylan and get out.'

Ms Newton says her two daughters were in the front garden playing when she ran outside covered in soot carrying her four-year-old son.

Her neighbours' cat Tinker, who was in the house at the time, sadly died in the blaze.

Ms Newton said: 'My first thought was to make sure my kids were safe.

Lucky: The devastated family described the incident as a nightmare, the children couldn't stop screaming

Battered: The house looks almost unrecognisable after the device shot out of its plug and exploded

'My son was screaming and when my girls saw us run outside they heard me shouting 'fire' and they burst into tears too.

'I thought the cat was in the house so I left Dylan outside and I ran back in but I couldn't see or breathe because there was so much smoke.

'It's awful that Tinker died but I'm grateful it wasn't my kids. It could have been so much worse.'

Ms Newton added: 'Lauren's bedroom was covered in flames and she's lost everything and the smoke spread to the rest of the house.

Devastated: Nathan Huyton, 10, and his sister Ebony, six, are mourning the death of Tinker (pictured) after a fire started by an e-cigarette which exploded in their neighbours house while it was charging

'Everything is covered in black soot 
and the roof is destroyed too. We can't even enter our house because 
it's not safe so we don't have any of our belongings.

'I'm staying with my partner and Dylan and the girls are staying with their dad, otherwise we'd be homeless.'

She hopes the ordeal will act as a warning to others.

Tinker's devastated owner Sean Huyton, 42, said: 'We’re all heartbroken.

'The kids are absolutely devastated. Ebony, our daughter, cried herself to sleep on Saturday night.

'Tinker was just a really good cat, really friendly. Everybody on the street loved him and bought him toys.

The majority of explosions and fatalities caused by e-cigarettes is down to people using the wrong chargers, fire crews warn.

Though they have a USB connection, they need to be charged using specific e-cig chargers, not be plugged into laptops or iPad chargers, which cause them to overheat.

Many people also over-tighten the screwed connection, which damages the battery cells, creating heat.

And while mobile phones can be left charging for an extensive period of time, the batteries in e-cigarettes do not have in-built protection to prevent overheating.

Therefore, if left too long, the lithium-ion battery will combust and explode.

'We buried the cat yesterday in the front garden. Our other cat Sparkle spent four hours sitting on top of the grave.'

Blasting the new tobacco-free trend, Mr Huyton urged for companies to do more to prevent fatalities.

He said: 'These e-cigarettes come from all over the world.

'You never really know if they’re safe. Something needs to be done about it.'

E-cigarettes are used by more than two million Britons – three times the number in 2012.

Last year, Evelyn Raywood, 68, died as a result of a blaze apparently started by the battery of her device. It is the only fatality linked to e-cigarettes, but there have been a number of close calls.

Last month a hotel barmaid was engulfed in flame when one exploded as it was being charged with an iPhone charger.

A pensioner was also badly burned when her e-cigarette ignited her oxygen supply.

And in Leicester, a woman’s car was set on fire when her e-cigarette exploded as it was being charged in the vehicle’s auxiliary socket.

Loyal: The Huyton family paid tribute to their moggie and called for tighter safety regulations on e-cigarettes

David Acton, chairman of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority, added: 'The family had a lucky escape with discovering the fire when they did, although their house is damaged and they have lost their pet.

'Please can we remind people to take extra care when it comes to electrical items, not leaving them plugged in too long and making sure wires, plugs and chargers are in good working order.'

The use of e-cigarettes is also the source of controversy. Last week, the British Medical Association
 called for e-cigarettes to be banned in public places and claimed they 
are just as dangerous as smoking.
