Brian Williams has cancelled an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman 24 hours after announcing he would be temporarily stepping down from the NBC Nightly News.

The embattled broadcaster was set to be interviewed on the chat show next Thursday, but sources at NBC News have told the Daily Mail Online he will not be appearing.

On Saturday the veteran journalist announced Lester Holt would be taking over his role 'for several days' after he admitted lying about a story. 

During an appearance on Letterman in 2013 he gave a vivid account of how a helicopter he was travelling in was hit by an RPG while covering the Iraq conflict.

Williams apologized on Wednesday and revealed he was actually in a trailing video.

In a statement released on Saturday he said: 'I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days, and Lester Holt has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue.' 

Since apologizing over his exaggerated claims on Wednesday, questions have been raised about several previous claims by Williams including that he saw a body in the Hurricane Katrina floodwaters that hit New Orleans in 2005.

Now local residents in the sleepy New Jersey suburb of Red Bank are the latest to question his credibility over a story he told Esquire magazine in 2005 about being mugged at gunpoint during the 1970s.

Williams recalls being left 'looking up at a thug's snub-nosed .38 while selling Christmas trees out of the back of a truck.'

According to his story he was trying to help a local church when the thief grabbed his money.

'That wasn't a bad job, until a guy came up and stuck a .38-caliber pistol in my face and made me hand over all the money. Merry Christmas, right? Of course, I suddenly appreciated the other jobs I thought I hated,' Williams recalled when he told New Jersey Monthly in 2008.

HBO's Bill Maher joked that Brian Williams told such big lies that he could work at Fox News

But several longtime Red Bank residents aren't convinced by Williams' claims.

'I would highly doubt he's telling the truth,' Danny Murphy told the New York Post.

'I find it hard to believe anyone was held up in this area in the '70s. It was very safe,' said Murphy who owned a restaurant just a few blocks from where Williams claims he was accosted.

The Post spoke to several residents who recall the area being so safe at the time that kids could walk around alone at night on their own.

'It was never dangerous here,' said Yolanda DeMaria, 93. 'It was a very peaceful town, a lovely town. It was a small town with a dress shop and a five-and-dime. No one locked their cars.' 

Another local resident also found Williams' claims difficult to take seriously. 

'Don't listen to Brian Williams,' said Les Carbone, 85. 'He's going to tell you a lot of things. I doubt he was robbed at gunpoint. I was born in Red Bank, there were no crimes like that. Tell Brian Williams to stop lying.'

Conan O'Brien also poked fun at Williams in a parody video where the news anchor takes credit for just about everything

Williams' troubles started on 30 January when the Nightly News ran a tribute to a retired soldier he had first met in Iraq in 2003. In his report Williams repeated his claim that his aircraft was hit by enemy fire and then the complaints started to flood in 

With Williams’ credibility being called into question over his wild claims about his time in Iraq, NBC News announced on Friday that an internal investigation is being carried out.

Also on Friday, Williams found himself the butt of a joke by Bill Maher, who suggested that the news anchor told such big lies that he could work at Fox News.

'When we get older… we misplace our keys, we have trouble with people’s names, we can’t remember if the helicopter we were in crashed,' quipped the late night host during his HBO show.

Williams made such a 'blatant departure from the truth, he got an offer from Fox News,' joked Maher.

Conan O'Brien is another late night host getting mileage out of Williams. He joked that the NBC News presenter had tried to 'get in on someone's glory' more than once.

O'Brien then showed manipulated video of Williams saying he was responsible for the Miracle on the Hudson plane landing and climbing a giant rock - like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible 2.
