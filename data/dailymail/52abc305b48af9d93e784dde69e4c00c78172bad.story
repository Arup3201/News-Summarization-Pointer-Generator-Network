Cat owners should buy their pets bells for Christmas said Sir David Attenborough

If you want to savour the twittering of birds in your garden, you might have to get used to the occasional tinkling as well.

Buying your cat a collar with a bell is the best way to give birds a boost in the battle for survival over the winter.

That’s the advice from Sir David Attenborough, whose love for birds is behind his Tweet of the Day programme for Radio 4.

The Christmas Day edition will feature the distinctive call of the robin, the star of Christmas cards the world over and a symbol of the festive season.

Sir David, 87, explained that pretty images of friendly robins hopping about in the snow hid the reality of a desperate battle to survive the cold months, when food is scarce and danger is everywhere – especially with cats on the prowl.

‘Cats kill an extraordinarily high number of birds in British gardens,’ he told the Radio Times.

Asked whether cat owners should buy bell collars for their pets at Christmas, he replied: ‘That would be good for the robins, yes.

The robin almost certainly evolved a relationship with animals such as wild pigs, which grub around in the earth looking for tubers. Robins would have followed in their wake, picking up beetles and worms.

‘And the likelihood is – though nobody can prove it – that when human beings started cutting down forests and planting fields, the robin moved over from the pigs and took up mankind as a companion.

‘That’s why, if you’re digging in the 
garden, a robin will often pop up – and it will appear to be very brave,
 because it’ll pick up worms and beetle grubs from around your feet. And
 that’s very endearing, isn’t it?’

Cats,
 however, are best kept at a distance. According to the most recent 
figures from the Mammal Society, cats catch up to 55million birds a 
year.

Which is where the bell collar comes 
in. It is the best protection for birds in the garden, giving them ample
 warming that danger is prowling their way.

In
 a wide-ranging interview, Sir David also warned that scientists should 
abandon attempts to bring extinct species such as the woolly mammoth 
back to life.

Japanese 
scientists recently extracted the bone marrow from mammoth remains with a
 view to resurrecting the creature, in a real-life echo of the movie 
Jurassic Park.

But Sir David, who encounters extinct 
animals in a new Sky documentary using special effects, said: ‘I think 
it could conceivably happen, but to what end?

'We’ve got quite enough 
problems saving the species we’ve got without bringing old ones back.’

Sir David also suggested that conservationists shouldn’t focus on particular species dying out. He said: ‘It’s very easy to say “The giant panda’s disappearing”.

What you should be saying is that the ecosystem of which the giant panda is only a part is disappearing.’
