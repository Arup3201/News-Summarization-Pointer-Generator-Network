Arsene Wenger insists the quality of Mesut Ozil is more evident when he is back home, studying the game for a second time, while others at Arsenal are generating football which inspires love at first sight.

Alexis Sanchez swept in a majestic volley - his third important goal in as many games - and Danny Welbeck left a positive impression on his debut, while Jack Wilshere lifted the crowd and infected his team-mates with his aggression and desire during Saturday's 2-2 draw against Manchester City.

It was arguably Wilshere's most influential performance in an Arsenal shirt since his serious ankle injuries, topped with his first goal since January, a deft chip to fool Joe Hart, and an assist for Sanchez.

Danny Welbeck missed a golden chance to open his Arsenal account on his debut

Danny Welbeck is the third PL player to play for Arsenal and Man Utd after Mikael Silvestre and Robin van Persie. 

'He has found his pace back,' said Wenger. 'That for a while was not the case. He finished with his right foot and chipped a goalkeeper who knows him well. For a long time, he did not kick the ball well because of his ankle.

'Now in training, he kicks the ball well and works on his finishing. His shot with his ankle is now clean again. He has found power back. He stays on his feet, which is the big difference. When he was not as confident, he would push on his ankle and go down on his body. He is more solid.'

It will not have been lost on Wilshere that Paul Scholes, one of his arch-critics, was pitch-side as a BT Sport pundit. 'You cannot explain his performance by the criticism of Paul Scholes, but you have to respond to your critics in a public job,' said Wenger.

One good game will not end the scrutiny. Arsenal and England will demand this form consistently, even if they are to play him in different roles. Wenger does not want to lose his 'penetrative qualities' by deploying him deep, as Roy Hodgson did in Switzerland last week.

The deeper role is unnatural for Wilshere, who is more at ease bursting onto the game, exploding past opponents, threading passes and, hopefully, threatening to goal. 

'In the formation we play I should be scoring more,' said Wilshere. 'I've had a few chances this season. Hopefully that will be one of many. I want to go forward more. You saw with England, sometimes I lost a bit of concentration. I'm happy to play either.'

Ultimately, his efforts could not produce more than a point for his team. It was a third successive draw in the Barclays Premier League for Arsenal. Like City, they are stuttering, spilling points as pacesetters Chelsea gallop on.

Aaron Ramsey is not in the fluent groove he was and the wonderfully-gifted Ozil flickers around the game's fringes, irritating fans with his languid manner, having been forced wide on the left in Wenger's new formation.

'People will always have this kind of attitude about him,' said Wenger. 'He worked hard and played quite well. You always see a good Ozil when you watch the game again. Then you realise his timing and his quality of the pass.

'Sometimes you can be frustrated during the game but you must not over-react. When you watch the game in a cool manner again, you see what a good player he is.'

City are more physical, more mature and more complete than Arsenal. Wenger will be encouraged by team's determination to resist and their refusal to accept the inevitable slide towards a negative result when things started conspire against them.

'They have definitely made progress,' said Vincent Kompany, as he agreed the Londoners looked 'a better side' than last season.

'We're forcing it a bit more,' said Wilshere. 'We're not accepting it. We're not just letting them play when we lose the ball. We want to win it back. That first five seconds is so important if you want to win the ball back.

'Towards the end of last season when it looked like we wouldn't get into the top four, we sat down and said: Listen, this isn't good enough. Since the last seven or eight games of last season until now, we've had a fantastic attitude.

'Everyone in training is buying into the defensive side of the game and we want to improve that, winning the ball back high up. Once we do that, our quality is going to change.'

Wenger will require this fighting spirit because bare patches are already appearing in his defensive cover after right-back Mathieu Debuchy damaged ligaments in his right-ankle after catching his studs in the turf.

Debuchy is expected to be out for two months, which will bring Calum Chambers, the only back-up centre-half, in at right-back. Other defenders in the senior squad are left-back Kieran Gibbs, just back from injury, and 19-year-old right-back Hector Bellerin, yet to make a competitive start for Arsenal.

Wenger admitted Debuchy's injury, in the 81st minute, hurt his team. 'We just switched off,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We did not look the same team. Not because of Chambers but we looked a bit lost.'

Another test awaits against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday while City are also bound for Germany to face Bayern Munich, where they won last year but fell one goal short of winning the group.

'This is an away game against one of the hardest teams to play in the world right now,' said Kompany. 'But we should take confidence out of the last game we played in Munich.'
