Controversy: Rio Ferdinand arrives in Durban for a pre-season tour with Manchester United

Rio Ferdinand yesterday insisted it was not racist to call his England teammate Ashley Cole a ‘choc ice’.

The Manchester United star reignited the John Terry race row after apparently endorsing the term, which it is commonly understood to mean ‘black on the outside, white on the inside’.

His comments were made days after Cole testified in defence of his Chelsea teammate Terry as he stood trial accused of racially abusing Ferdinand’s brother, Anton, during a Premier League game last October.

Last night Ferdinand used Twitter to 
declare ‘choc ice’ was not a racist expression and that it simply 
suggested that someone was a fake.

The controversy started when someone 
sent Ferdinand a tweet about Cole’s involvement in the Terry trial. The 
person wrote: ‘Looks like Ashley Cole’s going to be their choc ice. Then
again he’s always been a sell-out. Shame on him.’

Ferdinand responded: ‘I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic. Hahahahahahhha!!’

After initial criticism by other 
Twitter users, Ferdinand tweeted again: ‘If I want to laugh at something
someone tweets....I will! Hahahahaha! Now stop getting ya knickers in a
twist!’

But as the online backlash continued 
Ferdinand tweeted to his three million followers: ‘What I said yesterday
is not a racist term. Its (sic) a type of slang/term used by many for 
someone who is being fake. So there.’

Cole, who is also a friend of Rio and 
his brother, had earlier moved to calm the situation down and issued a 
statement through his lawyers.

Rio Ferdinand today said his retweet was not racist

It said: ‘Ashley Cole has been made 
aware of the discussion following comments appearing on Twitter and 
wishes to make it clear that he and Rio Ferdinand are good friends and 
Ashley has no intention of making any sort of complaint.

‘Ashley appreciates that Tweeting is so quick it often results in off-hand and stray comments.’

The original tweet was believed to have been made by a man from Derbyshire.

A Derbyshire Police spokeswoman today said the force had received no complaints over the matter.

During the trial at Westminster 
Magistrates’ Court, prosecutors alleged that Terry had maliciously 
called Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand a ‘f****** black 
c***’.

The 31-year-old Chelsea captain 
admitted calling Anton Ferdinand a ‘f****** black c***’ and a ‘f****** 
k***head’ but said he was only sarcastically repeating a false 
allegation made by Anton Ferdinand.

Giving evidence for the defence, Cole 
backed Terry, insisting his teammate was not a racist and saying it was 
wrong to prosecute him.

Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said an
acquittal on the racially aggravated public order offence was the only 
verdict he could reach because there was no way to be sure what Terry 
had said.

The players met in the Chelsea 
changing room after the match and shook hands, writing it all off as 
‘handbags’ and on-pitch ‘banter’.

Even when he was shown footage of the incident on YouTube, Anton Ferdinand did nothing.

But
an off-duty police officer watching on TV, who claimed to be able to 
lip read, complained to the Metropolitan Police that a racially-aggravated offence had 
taken place.

In the weeks that followed Terry was 
stripped of the England captaincy and lost a fortune in sponsorship 
deals. England manager Fabio Capello resigned in a row over the move.

Cole
gave evidence for his Chelsea and England team-mate during the trial 
and told the court that the case should not have gone ahead.

‘We shouldn’t be sitting here,’ Cole said.

He said that while racism should never be tolerated, saying back what you thought someone said was ‘completely different’.

Cole said he did not hear what Terry said to Ferdinand despite being only about a car-length away from the row.

But
he said he saw Ferdinand shouting either the word ‘black’ or ‘Bridgey’ –
an apparent reference to Wayne Bridge – and make a lewd gesture at 
Terry.

Cole said he told 
Ferdinand: ‘What you’re doing to JT [Terry] is out of order’. He added 
that he did not shake Ferdinand’s hand after the game.

Mobbed: Terry made no comment as he left the court building to shouts of support from crowds waiting outside

Anton Ferdinand fears for football's future and believes John Terry's acquittal sends out the wrong message to young people, it was reported today.

Reacting to the court's verdict for the first time, Ferdinand said he was shocked and disappointed by the ruling.

The Queen's Park Rangers player told the People: 'It is one rule for us, and one rule for John Terry.'

Ferdinand, who was not present in court when the verdict was read out, is in Malaysia for his club's pre-season tour of the Far East.

A source close to the player told the newspaper he was pleased to be out of the country during the fallout from the case.

'He needs to come to terms with what has happened because he is very, very disappointed,' the source said.

'Anton has been getting brilliant support from his team-mates.'

The left-back said abuse towards 
Terry over his affair with Miss Perroncel was commonplace during games, 
but he had never seen him react to it, explaining: ‘He would probably 
laugh about it, it’s part and parcel of the game and you get used to 
it.’

Cole was supported by a
host of football stars, Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard and the club's
former manager Jose Mourinho, who vouched that Terry was not racist.

Cole described Terry as a good friend and a great captain.

He said: ‘He’s one of the best, very inspirational. He gets the team  going in big games. He’s cool, calm and collected.’

Terry
was acquitted on Friday. Ferdinand was not at the hearing as he was 
flying from Heathrow with the QPR squad for a pre-season tour of the Far
East.

Chief magistrate
Howard Riddle, who is also a district judge, said there was not enough 
evidence to prove ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ that Terry was guilty.

He said TV footage did not show the complete exchange, meaning it was impossible to be sure exactly what was said.

‘In those circumstances, there being a doubt, the only verdict the court can record is one of not guilty,’ the magistrate said.

He
added: 'There is no doubt that John Terry uttered the words 'f****** 
black c***' at Anton Ferdinand. When he did so he was angry.

'Mr Ferdinand says that he did not precipitate this comment by himself, accusing Mr Terry of calling him a black c***.

'Even
with all the help the court has received from television footage, 
expert lip readers, witnesses and indeed counsel, it is impossible to be
sure exactly what were the words spoken by Mr Terry at the relevant 
time.'

Both Terry and Anton Ferdinand could face disciplinary action after the FA decided to reopen its inquiry into the incident.

The
FA, who had a lawyer attending every day of the trial, said they would 
look at the findings of the court case before deciding whether or not to
bring any proceedings against the players.

The
FA will decide whether Terry should still be charged with using abusive
and insulting words and with making reference to Ferdinand’s ethnic 
origin and colour.

Ferdinand could be charged with bringing the game into disrepute for the comments he made during the exchange.

Charges can still be brought by the 
FA against Terry even thought he was acquitted in court because they 
have a lower burden of proof - Liverpool's Luis Suarez was banned last 
season for racially abusing Patrice Evra but that case never went to 
court.

In a brief statement
an FA spokesman said: 'The FA notes the decision in the John Terry case
and will now seek to conclude its own enquiries.'

Gordon
Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, 
says revelations about the obscene remarks which are exchanged during 
matches have damaged the game's reputation.

Taylor has urged the FA to ensure that players understand their responsibilities as role models next season.

He also suggested the FA are in 'a difficult position' over whether they charge Terry.

Taylor
said: 'It has been an unedifying process and the game has been damaged 
as a result of the dirty linen being washed in public.

Even if he had been convicted, Terry would have faced a fine of just £2,500, a fraction of his reported £130,000 weekly wage.

But taxpayers will pick up a bill of up to £500,000 for the prosecution.
