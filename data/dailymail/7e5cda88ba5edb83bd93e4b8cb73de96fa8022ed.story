Democrats spent as much as $50,000 a trip in the midterm elections to fly Bill and Hillary Clinton into battleground areas to make appearances on behalf of top congressional and gubernatorial candidates, a news report revealed today.

And the party has little to show for the massive expenditures, expected to collectively reach a $1 million when final campaign finance reports are turned in.

Democrats lost their majority in the upper chamber of the legislative branch, and GOP underdog candidates nosed ahead in several governors races.

Federal election filings show that Grimes paid $17,000 to have Clinton flown in to drudge up votes for her in October, yet she still lost

The Iowa Democratic Party paid $50,000 to bring former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton into the Hawkeye State to headline retiring Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry in September and campaign for Democratic Senate nominee Bruce Braley

As National Journal pointed out on election night, just eight of the 17 high-profile candidates Hillary Clinton personally campaigned for won reelection last week. Additionally, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor got hands-on campaign help from Bill, but not from Hillary – and he also lost.

One other senator Hillary backed, Louisiana's Mary Landrieu, is headed to a run-off election next month that polls say she will likely lose, giving the political power couple an eight for 18 record overall this fall.

A more comprehensive review of the Clintons' travel schedule issued by Buzzfeed today that includes fundraisers and all the races the duo involved themselves in at every level of government puts Bill's individual count at 47 candidates and Hillary's at upward of 26.

The news publication's research shows that the former first couple participated in approximately 75 rallies and fundraisers and flew more than 50,000 miles crisscrossing the country - in private jets - on behalf of Democratic candidates.

Buzzfeed discovered that the party's top recruits spent at least $699,000 on the Clintons' travel through Oct. 15, when the last finance reports were due.

Among those candidates willing to pay the big bucks in order to buy an appearance from a Clinton were Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic nominee to the Senate in the Bluegrass State.

Grimes - who handily lost her race to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell - paid $17,000 for Hillary's charter flight ahead of an Oct. 15 appearance, Politico revealed last week. She paid a yet-to-be disclosed sum for Hillary to return to Kentucky in the final days of the campaign, as well, that is likely on par with the original billing.

According to Bloomberg, the Iowa Democratic Party paid $50,000 in September to bring both Clintons to the state to headline retiring Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry and campaign for their chosen replacement for Harkin's seat, Rep. Bruce Braley, whom Bill Clinton unforgettably called 'Bruce Bailey' in his remarks.

Democrats again paid to bring both Clintons back to the Hawkeye State on two separate occasions to campaign for Braley - who also lost - but those trips have not yet been reported to the FEC.

Most of the high-profile Democrats the Clinton's campaigned for this fall lost their races. That includes Georgia Senate candidate Michelle Nunn, seen here at an October 31 rally in at Atlanta, Georgia with Bill Clinton

In an email today highlighting Hillary Clinton's eyebrow-raising travel costs both on and off the campaign trail, the Republican National Committee gave the presumed 2016 presidential candidate the nickname 'high-flying Hillary' in response to Buzzfeed's report.

'The Clintons' Midterm Support For Fellow Democrats Came With A Hefty Price Tag,' read the briefing's tagline. 

'It's not just political events where Hillary Clinton prefers to "travel in style,' the document said, pointing back to a Las Vegas Review-Journal article outlining the former first lady's expensive tastes. 

On top of her six-figure speaking fees, a contract with the University of Nevada shows that she usually demands to fly on a 'Gulfstream 450 or larger jet,' accommodations in the 'presidential suite' of hotels, rooms in the same block for her entourage of 'travel aids,' $500 to cover her lead aide's out-of-pocket costs and money to cover her party's meals and 'incidentals.'

Her contract also specifies how her presence at the events can be billed and how many people she will take photos with afterward.

Republican research firm America Rising, a leading voice in the anti-Clinton 2016 sphere, has been documenting Clinton's cushy travel accommodations for months. 

In a blog post today the group said, 'Democrats griping about the President’s fundraising or lack thereof for their midterm campaign might want to take note of the expensive tab the Clintons billed campaigns for their private jet travel.' 

'Sure seems like what really happened was Sec. Clinton got midterm Democrats to foot the bill for her 2016 campaign travel,' the group said in an Election Day blog.

Former Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's appearances on behalf of Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor weren't enough to save the Arkansas lawmaker, either

One candidate Hillary Clinton campaigned for, Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, may still have a shot at keeping her seat in a run-off election next month, but the odds aren't good

Throughout the fall America Rising has suggested in emails to reporters that millionaire Clinton should pay for her own way when she drops in to election hot zones.

'Keep in mind it would only take 4 hours worth of speaking gigs for Hillary to have picked up the travel tab herself,' it said today in a post on its website.

However, as Buzzfeed points out, that would violate election laws in most circumstances.

Asked for a clarification on the organization's argument today, America Rising Executive Director Tim Miller told MailOnline in an email: 'The Clintons traveled to plenty of campaign events on corporate dimes this past cycle.'

Miller pointed to Clinton's trip to Las Vegas, during which she managed to work in a campaign stop for the Nevada Democratic Party and  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid into her schedule while there on behalf of UNLV.

At another point this fall Clinton made a brief public appearance with  Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn and attended a fundraiser for him while she was in the city on other business. 

Miller told MailOnline the point of America Rising's comments about her travel funding was to bring attention to the 'absurdity of her speaking fees in addition to the excessive cost they put on campaigns.

'Plus there are options for cheaper travel, of course,' he said.

Clinton could, theoretically, travel commercially, as fellow 2016 frontrunner Rand Paul did this election cycle as he hopped from state to state. 

Realistically, though, it would be more difficult, if not impossible, for the Clintons, who still have mandatory Secret Service details, to take transportation open to the public.

 Buzzfeed noted in its report that Hillary often travels with four agents. Getting all of them seats near her on cross country flights, sometimes into rural airports, would be complicated, to say the least.
