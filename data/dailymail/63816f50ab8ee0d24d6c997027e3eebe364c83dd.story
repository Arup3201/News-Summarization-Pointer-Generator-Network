Hull City will be able to make another bid to change their name to Hull Tigers after an arbitration panel set aside the Football Association's decision to reject the name change.

The club's owner Assem Allam wants to re-brand the club but the name change was rejected by the FA Council last year.

Now an arbitration tribunal has ruled the name should remain Hull City for the time being but that the Council's decision be set aside after the involvement of Football Supporters' Federation chairman Malcolm Clarke on the sub-committee which recommended the name change be rejected.

Hull City are free to make a new application to change their name to Hull Tigers

The findings of the arbitration tribunal stated: 'We have concluded that the decision of the council cannot stand. We set it aside.

'At this stage of the season it would be impractical and wholly inappropriate to direct the association to make a fresh decision to take effect during the current season.

'The club is free to make a new application.'

Hull managed to claim a point against Leicester despite Tom Huddlestone's 72nd-minute dismissal
