When Liesl Testwuide's eight-year-old son left for summer camp, she hoped to receive a letter detailing his frog-catching adventures and sleeping under the stars.

But what the mother-of-three boys received was a very honest - and hilarious - note about what really goes on at camp.

'I've ate more push-pops then anyone. I've ate 23 since Monday. Still two days left, 37 is the rekerd and I can beat it. Sweet!,' the Wisconsin boy wrote last year.

The funny letter has recently gone viral, despite single mom Testwuide sharing it on hairpinturnsahead.com, her blog about parenting and dating, in July last year.

The youngster appeared to be having a great time, and showed great resourcefulness. He wrote: 'I used my toothbrush to dig for werms. Don't freek out. The guy in the bottom bunk lets me use him.'

The letter contained other gems about the perils of horse riding, the horrors of eating oatmeal and the best way to say the alphabet.Â 

'I don't know his name (boy from camp) but he can burp the alphabit like me. A kid named Zack can burp the alphabit backwords. I'm practicing that,' Testwuide's son wrote.

Dear mom: Liesl was surprised by the letter her son sent from summer camp

New experiences: The youngster was excited to share the new skills he was learning, such as burping the alphabet backwards

Happy to share: Liesl's son wrote that he was looking forward to showing off his new-found skills

'Good you packt extra underwear since I had diyareeya. It got on my 
shoes but not my pillow. I'm having fun at camp and learning stuff.

'Did you know you can light farts on fire? I'll show you on Satterday.'

Testwuide,
 whose blog often discusses the reality of raising three young boys, 
explained that she had been anxiously waiting to hear back from her 
youngest son.

His trip to summer camp was the first time he had been away from home longer than just one night.

After
 last year's amusing letter home, the single mom said she will be 
packing her son off with a whole book of stamps to see what he comes up 
with this time.
