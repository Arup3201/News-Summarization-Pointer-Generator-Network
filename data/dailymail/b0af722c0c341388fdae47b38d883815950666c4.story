The inner workings of ancient creatures shed light on the evolution of many modern species.

Now scientists have discovered the most intact ancient cardiovascular system and it comes from a fossilised arthropod.

The cardiovascular system of the fossil arthropod Fuxianhuia protensa is 520 million-years-old and reveals a complex circulation network, according to British experts.

F. protensa was a predator, which appeared during the evolutionary burst called the Cambrian Explosion around 520 million years ago.

It was around 4in (11cm) long and had movable eyestalks, which had concentrations of nerve tissue inside them.

It could rotate its eyestalks in a wide arc allowing it to see in different directions.

The fossil, which is a distant relative of modern lobsters, spiders and millipedes, was discovered in China.

It shows a dark carbon trace within the outline of the fossil, which outlines a heart in the middle of the body with blood vessels leading to eyes, antennae, brain and legs.

The discovery was made by researchers in China, the U.S. and the UK, who X-rayed the F. protensa fossil.

Most living animals move oxygen and nutrients around their body using a cardiovascular system.

The fossil find is direct evidence that by 520 million years ago the arthropod group had already developed complex organ systems that remain recognisable in species today, according to the study, which was published in Nature Communications.

Arthropods are the most diverse group of modern animals and come in many different shapes and sizes.

Yet some of the basic arrangements of their cardiovascular system are distinctive to this group, such as a heart towards the back of the body and how blood vessels are arranged through body segments.

‘This is a significant discovery. The exquisitely preserved cardiovascular structures of F. protensa allow us to make direct comparison with other arthropods alive today, which has revealed the ancestral basic pattern for the wide range of cardiovascular systems seen in modern arthropods, such as insects, spiders, lobsters and millipedes,’ said lead author and museum palaeontologist Dr Xiaoya Ma.

‘This cardiovascular system is closely linked to the brain, eyes and antennae of the animal, showing a high demand for oxygen from these highly active parts of the body.’

F. protensa is now the most anatomically well-known fossil arthropod as its brain, nervous system and gut have previously been identified. This gives more insight than ever about the early evolution of the group.

Fellow museum palaeontologist and co-author Dr Greg Edgecombe said: ‘The specimen is really unusually preserved.

‘The external structures of the animal were relatively decayed away and are preserved as an imprint of the body, but one single internal organ system is pristinely preserved as carbon trace.

‘We had to rule out what it wasn’t, and were left with the cardiovascular system. Then everything fell into place.’

Arthropods have a rich fossil history, but until recently very little was known about their cardiovascular systems.

The animal has a complex brain too: In 2012 scientists revealed that Fuxianhuia protensa had a brain just as complex as today's lobsters and crabs. Another fossil (pictured) showed the creature's preserved brain as dark brown patches and is the oldest fossil example of a complex brain in early animals

In October 2012 scientists revealed that the ancient animal Fuxianhuia protensa had a brain just as complex as today's lobsters and crabs.

Another 520million-year-old fossil identified by experts from the museum showed the creature's preserved brain as dark brown patches and is the oldest fossil example of a complex brain in early animals.

The team used the museum's scanning electron microscope (SEM) to look at the surface structure of the brain material and an energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscope to see how the details of the brain and optic tracts were preserved. They found that the brain was made up of three sections that were connected to the head segments.

And nerve fibre tracts ran from the brain to the eyes and antennae.

'We were surprised by the degree of complexity, which was more comparable to that seen in living crustaceans and insects,' said Dr Edgecombe.

'The obvious comparisons are with crustaceans like lobsters or prawns because they also have movable eye stalks. The eye stalks have elaborate concentrations of neural tissue inside them, and the brain has 3 segments that are fused in front of the mouth.'

The team said the animal could rotate its eye stalks over quite a wide arc, making it able to see in different directions.

Dr Edgecombe said:  'It must have had quite acute vision. This is consistent with its relatively sophisticated brain because we would expect big, movable eyes to be associated with quite sophisticated neural wiring.’  

It is thought that F. protensa branched off from the arthropod evolutionary tree before the common ancestor of today's arthropods appeared.

Dr Ma said: 'The common ancestor of this diverse group [arthropods] may have also had elaborate brains similar to those of lobsters or flies, rather than to the simpler brains of, say, brine shrimp or fairy shrimp.’

It is extremely rare to find fossilised soft tissue but Chengjiang - the site where both the fossils showing the animal’s brain structure and cardiovascular system were found - is one of the places where soft anatomy of many different kinds of animals is preserved in exceptional detail.

Dr Edgecombe said: ‘The keys to preserving soft anatomy in Cambrian fossils seems to be low oxygen conditions that inhibit bacterial activity soon after the animal dies and then rapid burial of the carcass in fine-grained sediment.'
