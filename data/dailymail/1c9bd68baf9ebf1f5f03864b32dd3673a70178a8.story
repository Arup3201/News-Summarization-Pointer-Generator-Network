Mitt Romney now says his infamous ’47 percent’ comments that helped doom his 2012 presidential campaign bid were taken completely out of context.

‘Actually, I didn’t say that,’ the former republican nominee said in a recent interview in which he said the comments at a Florida fundraiser were came to be ‘perceived as being something very different’ than how they were intended.

This is a pivot for Romney, who has previously said at different points that the statements were ‘not elegantly stated’ and ‘completely wrong.’

Misinterpreted? Mitt Romney admits his 2012 presidential bid was heavily damaged by his '47 percent' remarks at a meeting with donors in Florida but now characterizes them as taken out of context

The presidential also-ran and one-time governor of Massachusetts voiced his new stance on the issue during a long sit down with the Washington Post published Saturday.

The controversial comments were made during a closed-door meeting with donors in Florida in the September before last year’s presidential elections.

When a donor asked Romney how he intended to beat Barack Obama, he responded:

‘There are 47 percent who are with [Obama], who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.’

Get outta here: 'Actually, I didn't say that' was Romney's recently published response to questions about his taped comments that '47 percent of people...who are dependent on government, who believe they are victims' would be voting for Obama

These were the voters, Romney said at the time, who would be voting for Obama no matter what.

The remarks seemed damning to many at the time and were widely taken as an insult to the poor. Though Romney is on video making them, he now says they were misinterpreted.

‘But when you said there are 47 percent who won’t take personal responsibility…’ began Post interviewer Dan Balz, before Romney interrupted.

'That wasn't what was meant by it. That is the way it was perceived': Romney says the 47 percent comments were not meant as a jab at the poor

‘That's how it began to be perceived,’ Romney said. ‘And so I had to ultimately respond to the perception, because perception is reality.’

Regardless of whether Romney is to be believed, most would agree on another way he characterized them.

‘Well, clearly that was a very damaging quote and hurt my campaign effort,’ he said.

In a Washington Post interview, the former Republican candidate acknowledged the quote was 'very damaging' to his campaign but wasn't the attack on the poor that many perceived it to be
