It was an icon of the 1970s, as much an image for that decade as flares and disco dancing.

Raleigh Chopper bikes, with their padded backrest, distinctive handle-bars and saddle, need no introduction to anyone who grew up in that era.

And now a limited edition run of the classic bicycle has been created which will stir happy childhood memories of parents across Britain - and bring joy to their children.

The 2015 
Choppers are painted gold and silver to pay homage to the golden age of 
British motor racing, most notably the John Player Special rally cars.

Raleigh have created a special edition Chopper bike, inspired by the golden age of British motor racing era. Only 400 of the Chopper 2015 bikes have been made and it will retail at £250 

The special edition bikes will be available for a select few - as Raleigh will only produce 400 of the iconic cycle

The black and gold design evokes memories of 1970s motor racing, most notably the John Player Special rally cars of the period

Designer
 Alan Oakley developed a bike with huge handle bars, a bulky, padded 
seat with a back rest and a car-like gear lever on the main frame

They are being released alongside Chopper bikes in other colours, including red and green.

It
 follows in the wake of other classic Choppers including the original 
Mark 1 and Mark 2 Choppers of the 1970s, followed by several re-issues 
in the 2000s, including last year's limited edition Beano special.

Ben Hillsdon, Raleigh Marketing Manager said: 'Whether you're young or old it's hard not to be taken in by the charm of the Chopper.

'As soon as we saw the sleek black and gold leaf design of this year's Chopper we knew we were onto a winner.

'This British cultural icon has bags of personality and we're certain it will be an instant collector's item.

'Everyone
 knows the Chopper and many people grew up with it, so it appeals to a 
much wider audience than the cycling community. There is also a lot of 
excitement from the cycling shops.'

Daren
 Skyes, who runs the One Stop Chopper Shop that sells parts of the 
iconic bike, told the MailOnline: 'There's a lot of excitement about it.
 I have had about 30 to 40 people asking me about how they can buy it, 
but it's not going to be easy to get hold of one.

'It looks fantastic. I just wish they had put the name of Alan Oakley, who designed the bike, on it somewhere.'

The Chopper stopped being made in 1983, but was re-launched in 2004 due to popular demand

Sales of the Chopper bike took off in the 1970s in the UK and Raleigh sold 1.5 million of them in the UK alone

Raleigh
 made two versions of the bike - the Mark I from 1969 to 1972 and then 
the Mark II from 1972 to 1983. They also produced a number of limited 
edition bikes

The chopper was based on dragster cars and bikes of the 1960s and was a signifier of a child's coolness in the 1970s.

Ogle
 Design produced the concept art for Raleigh's design department headed 
by Alan Oakley including details such as the padded leather seat and 
distinctive wheels.

The first Chopper went into production in 1969 and became a cultural icon of the 1970s.

It
 had an unusually-shaped frame, high back seat and ape hanger Handlebars
 as well as differently sized wheels which were 16inches (41cm) at the 
front and 20inches (51cm) at the back. The design cost £32 for the most 
basic version at the time.

The
 Mark 2 was produced from 1972 until the end of production and had a 
seat that was moved forward to prevent the bike tipping up as well as 
other tweaks.

Around one and a half million bikes were sold before the BMX craze of the 1980s took over.

This was despite the bicycle being unstable, slow, heavy and trickier to ride than conventional bikes.

A lighter Mark 3 Chopper was launched in 2004 made of aluminium with various safety features

Mr
 Oakley, died in May 2012 after a battle with cancer. He drew up the 
design for the Chopper on an envelope as he travelled home from the USA,
 in 1967.  

Moving
 away from the traditional, diamond-shaped frame, Mr Oakley developed a 
bike with huge handle bars, a bulky, padded seat with a back rest and a 
car-like gear lever on the main frame. 

Initially, attempts to sell the Chopper in America were unsuccessful.

But sales took off in the early 1970s in the UK and according to Raleigh, 'changed the way a generation of British kids rode'.

The
 Chopper was so popular, Raleigh sold 1.5 million of them in the UK 
alone and the strange bike is credited with saving the company from 
bankruptcy.

Raleigh
 made two versions of the bike - the Mark I from 1969 to 1972 and then 
the Mark II from 1972 to 1983. They also produced a number of limited 
edition bikes. 

In August 1983, production of the Chopper ceased as BMX bikes became the fashionable choice. 

But in 2004, due to popular demand, a limited edition Chopper, costing between £200 and £300 for a Mark 3 model, was released.

The special edition bikes will be available for a select few - as Raleigh will only produce 400 of the iconic cycle.  

They are set to retail for £250 and can be ordered via any Raleigh shop. They will hit the high street in September this year.
