The Scottish independence referendum is still a week away - but one airport appears to regard it as a foregone conclusion.

A British traveller was shocked to be offered the 'Scottish pound' at a bureau de change in Dubai yesterday, apparently in anticipation of Scotland setting up its own currency.

The tourist joked: 'It seems that some people have already decided the outcome of the independence vote.'

Hasty? Dubai International Airport appeared to offer a 'Scottish pound' at its bureau de change

The 'Scottish pound' was being advertised at Dubai International Airport on a list of currencies which also included the British pound sterling.

It was offered at an exchange rate of 5.75 UAE dirhams to the pound - the same rate as the real pound.

Nick London, an English documentary maker, saw the bizarre mistake as he was travelling to South Africa.

'The British pound was at the top and Scottish pound was as a separate currency,' he said. 'It seems that some people have already decided the outcome of the independence vote.'

Debate: The currency to be used in an independent Scotland has been the subject of fierce disagreement

The 'pound Scots' was Scotland's currency during the Middle Ages, but was abolished at the time of the Union with England in 1707.

Although Scottish banks print pound banknotes, they are not a separate currency and are accepted in the rest of Britain.

The future of the pound in Scotland has been one of the fiercest debates during the independence campaign.

Defiant: Alex Salmond has repeatedly insisted that Scotland would be able to share the pound

Nationalists, led by Alex Salmond, insist that an independent Scotland would be able to carry on using the pound in a formal currency union with the rest of the UK.

However, the leaders of all three major British parties have ruled out this possibility, saying it would force taxpayers outside Scotland to guarantee Scotland's debt.

If Scotland does become independent after next Thursday's vote, other options include sharing the pound on an informal basis, setting up a new Scottish currency or joining the eurozone.
