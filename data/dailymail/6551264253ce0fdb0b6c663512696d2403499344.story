Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri wants to keep Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal and told him he already plays for a ‘great’ club.

Manchester United have been linked with Vidal for much of the summer and the Chile international has also attracted interest from other top clubs in Europe.

Allegri told La Gazzetta dello Sport: 'He (Vidal) is like a caged lion. He would like to play, but he needs to train more. Arturo has a great spirit.

'It is normal that there are rumours about him: the great teams search for the great players. But Vidal is already in a great team.'

The Juventus boss is keen to add two more players to his squad ahead of the season and the defence of their league title.

Patrice Evra, Alvaro Morata and Kingsley Coman have joined this summer, while Udinese winger Roberto Pereyra arrived on loan.

But Allegri, who replaced departed Antonio Conte at the helm earlier this summer, believes his team still needs further improvements.

'We need two more signings,' he added. 'But they have to be quality signings. We need a defender and a striker.

'It's useless to give names as acquisitions depend on who you can bring in and who is on the market.

'We have little time to act and we must choose carefully. We cannot afford to make any mistakes regarding these two signings.'

On the arrival of Evra, Allegri added: 'He's working hard, with a load he was not used to. He needs time to get accustomed to Italian football and these coaching methods.'

Allegri also wished his predecessor Conte good luck with the national team, saying: 'It was the right choice for the Italian national team. I wish him good luck. I hope he'll do well, Italy really need it.'

Juve begin their Serie A title defence against Chievo in Verona on August 30.
