A United Airlines flight from Honolulu to Guam was diverted to the remote island of Midway because of a mechanical issue.

The
 airline said Friday it flew the 335 passengers and 13 crew members from
 Flight 201 back to Honolulu. It put Guam-bound passengers on another 
flight to the U.S. territory.

The Boeing 777 
was heading to Guam on Thursday when it was diverted. United says 
replacement aircraft brought passengers back to Honolulu Friday morning.

The Navy used the atoll 1,300 miles northwest of Honolulu as a base during the Cold War but left in 1996.

It's now a national wildlife refuge home to more than 1 million seabirds, green sea turtles and endangered Hawaiian monk seals.

The island's residents manage the airstrip and wildlife refuge.

Passenger Teresita Smith, who was traveling with several family members on the flight, told reporters that around five hours into the trip the attendants became visibly nervous and a burning smell filled the aircraft.

Once the plane was down, the passengers were taken to an abandoned gym to await a rescue flight

The passengers were so terrified many were loudly praying.

'It 
was terribly frightening.Â  There was no doubt, 100 per cent emotion, of 
the feeling that the plane was going to go down,' she told KITV.
