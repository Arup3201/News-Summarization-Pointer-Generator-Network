Sportsmail's Graham Poll casts his eye over the weekend's controversial moments in the Barclays Premier League to assess whether the match officials made the correct call.

Arsenal v Manchester United

If Jack Wilshere was taller he would have head-butted Marouane Fellaini in the face. Instead he got as close as he could, after being incensed for no clear reason, but still should have been dismissed for his petulant act in the clear view of referee Mike Dean. 

The usually excellent Dean chose to leave Wilshere on which was hard to understand given his clear view of the offence.

Stoke City v Burnley

If Victor Moses was upset when Garry Monk accused him of being a cheat when Swansea played Stoke last month it hasn't affected his conduct.

Moses was certainly guilty of a dive in this match when he went over for a penalty which referee Martin Atkinson was well positioned to turn down. 

The only mystery was why the Leeds-based referee failed to stop play and caution Moses as he should have done. Until referees step up and carry out their duties properly, players will continue to dive and cheat.

Chelsea v West Brom

Chelsea are the best team in the Premier League by quite some distance this season and certainly don’t need to be helped by poor officiating. 

Lee Mason was let down badly by his assistant who somehow failed to see that Diego Costa was in an offside position when he scored the Blues' opening goal. 

However, West Brom can have no complaints about Mason when he rightly dismissed Claudio Yacob for a two-footed jumping tackle on Costa – that type of challenge needs to be stamped out of football.

Red card? Red face!

Referee James Linnington was left red faced when he decided to send Reading’s Alex Pearce off at Cardiff on Friday evening. As he searched his pockets he realised he did not have a red card with him and had to borrow one from his assistant referee!
