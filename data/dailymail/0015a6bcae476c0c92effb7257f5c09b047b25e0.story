Marilyn Monroe standing above a subway grating with her crisp white dress blowing up is one of the most well-recognised movie scenes of the 20th Century.

The famous moment in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch is now regarded as an icon of film history.

Marilyn's dress, created by costume designer William Travillaup, sold for a reported Â£3 million in 2011 and is about to attract interest once more.

The Japanese are paying homage to the star in the form of a multicoloured rice field artwork.

The art is made from nine rice species with seven different colours achieving realistic interpretation of light reflection and shadow

The image of Marilyn Monroe is made from 
nine rice species with seven different colors has popped up on a rice 
filed in Inakadatemura, Aomori prefecture, northern Japan.

It is part of a famous exhibition in the area.

Visitors flock to the rice field 
in northeastern Japan to see the breathtaking artworks stretching across
 the landscape at the exhibition which runs until mid-August.

The village began the exhibition 21 
years ago to attract tourists.

This year two giant murals, depicting a 
traditional Japanese courtesan and iconic Hollywood actress Marilyn 
Monroe, are drawing large crowds to the field.

The villagers used nine kinds of rice 
plants in seven colors to fashion the artworks on the field, which is 
140 meters long and 100 meters wide.

The art achieves realistic interpretation of light reflection and shadow, as well as accurate dimensions - purely through skilled placement of rice seeds.

Monroe's famous pose was recaptured again back in 2010 in the form on a 26 foot statue called called Forever Marilyn by artist Seward Johnson.

It towered over the south end of Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, for two years.

In the adjacent field sits a stunning artwork of a Japanese courtesan complete with intricate dress and flowers.

As early as late 600s Japan there were female entertainers hosting gatherings, pouring sake and offering company to men.

Known as 'saburuko' - translated as 'serving girls' - some of these women sold sexual services, while others simply hosted high-class occasions. And around 794 the culture of the geisha began to emerge: women who men would visit for romantic and sexual pleasure.

Traditional geisha - heavily made-up, immaculately dressed and coquettish entertainers - emerged in 18th century Japan, and these women did not officially sell sex - that being the preserve of a different group of female entertainers known as Oiran.
