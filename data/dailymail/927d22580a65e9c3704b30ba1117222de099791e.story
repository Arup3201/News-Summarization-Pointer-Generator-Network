The elite of European football will gather in Monte Carlo on Thursday evening to discover their opponents in the Champions League group stage.

It is typically an occasion of pageantry and presentations as the continental football season gets into full swing.

Here's your complete guide to the occasion.

When and where is the draw taking place?

The Champions League group stage draw will take place on Thursday, with the ceremony getting underway at 4.45pm UK time. It will take place at the Grimaldi Forum in sunny Monaco.

Who's in the draw?

Arsenal 1-0 Besiktas (agg 1-0)

Athletic Bilbao 3-1 Napoli (agg 4-2)

Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 Copenhagen (agg 7-2)

Ludogerets  1-0 Steaua Bucharest (agg 1-1)

Ludogorets won 6-5 on penalties AET

Malmo 3-0 Red Bull Salzburg (agg 4-2)

The group stage consists of eight groups of four teams, so there will be 32 participants in all.

22 of those   automatically qualified for the group stage by finishing high in their respective leagues last season. These teams are: Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Schalke 04, Juventus, Roma, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, Paris Saint-Germain, Monaco, Shakhtar Donetsk, CSKA Moscow, Ajax, Galatasaray, Anderlecht, Olympiacos and Basel.

These clubs are joined by 10 more who have advanced from the play-off round. Those who have made their way via this route  are: Maribor, APOEL, BATE Borisov, Zenit Saint Petersburg, Porto, Arsenal, Athletic Bilbao, Bayer Leverkusen, Malmo and Ludogorets.

How does the draw work?

To ensure a fair draw, the 32 teams are split into four pots based on the 2014 UEFA club coefficients. The coefficients are determined by the results of each club in the Champions League and Europa League over the last five seasons, plus the coefficient of their national association. The clubs receive two points for a win, one for a draw and nothing for a defeat.

So pot one will contain the strongest teams, including Real Madrid, who are the defending champions, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Chelsea and Arsenal.

But the strength of the competition means there are usually top teams lurking in the other pots. Pot two contains Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City. Liverpool are in pot three.

The one stipulation is that teams from the same country cannot be drawn together. So there will be no Chelsea against City or Liverpool, for example.

What happens then?

A computer then determines the full list of fixtures and travel plans can be made by the clubs accordingly. It's a round robin format in the group stage, with each team playing the other three home and away.

Here are the dates for your diary: Matchday One - September 16/17; 

Matchday Two - September 30/October 1; 

Matchday Three - October 21/22; 

Matchday Four - November 4/5; 

Matchday Five - November 25/26; 

Matchday Six - December 9/10.

Where can I watch the draw?

It will be screened live on Sky Sports News and British Eurosport, as well as the UEFA website. You can also follow it all live here on MailOnline.

What would be a good and bad draw for the English sides?

Manchester City

Being relatively new to the Champions League stage, City are in pot two and so they will face one of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Atletico Madrid or Porto in their group. A nightmare draw for Manuel Pellegrini's men would be, say, Real Madrid, Galatasaray and Roma. The ideal draw would see them against Porto, CSKA Moscow and APOEL.

Food for thought: Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping for a kind draw on Thursday

Predator: Star striker Sergio Aguero will play a key role in City's bid to win the Champions League

Chelsea 

Winners of the trophy in 2012 and regular semi-finalists, Chelsea are firmly entrenched in pot one. However, this doesn't necessarily mean it'll be a straightforward draw. Their nightmare combination would be with Paris Saint-Germain, Galatasaray and Roma. They did, though, beat the first two of those teams on their way to the semis last season. The simplest draw for Jose Mourinho's men would be Basle, CSKA Moscow and APOEL.

Happy memories: Chelsea won their only Champions League trophy during the 2011/12 season

Liverpool

Returning to the Champions League after a few seasons away, Liverpool are in pot three and could face a very tricky draw. The worst case scenario is probably Real Madrid, PSG and Roma. On the other hand, they'd be content with Porto, Basel and APOEL or BATE Borisov.

Arsenal

After negotiating their way past Besiktas at the Emirates on Wednesday, Arsenal will be in the top pot. So, similarly to Chelsea, they won't want to get PSG, Galatasaray and Roma. Once again, they wouldn't be too daunted by Basle, CSKA and APOEL.

Up for it: Arsenal will be in the top pot of seeds after overcoming Besiktas on Wednesday

What about the Europa League?

You'll just have to be patient. The Europa League draw, which will feature Everton and potentially Tottenham and Hull too, takes place on Friday at midday, again at the Grimaldi Forum. You can follow that live here on MailOnline, too.
