Whether it is putting up wallpaper, assembly flat-pack furniture or tiling a bathroom - British men are hopeless at DIY.

More than half admit to having wrecked their homes during a failed attempt to be useful around the house, according to a new survey.

And a third said they have been forced to try and cover up their mistakes after making a mess of a household job.

Useless: More than half of British men admit to having wrecked their home during a botched DIY attempt

Too proud to ask for help, half also confess to having left at least one DIY project unfinished.

The survey of a 1,000 men, carried out by Disney to coincide with the Blu-ray release of animation Wreck-It Ralph, found 58 per cent of men had botched a DIY job in their home.

And the most troublesome area is the bathroom where 20 per cent of all mishaps take place.

A tenth of men admit to having called in repairmen to correct their blunders and then passed off the results as their own work.

Pride: Half of British men also confess to having lest at least one DIY job unfinished

The same number say they frequently wreck things but carry on regardless because they are too proud to ask for help.

Fortunately, an older generation of British men still know their way around the house.

Rather than admit their own failings, 15 per cent call on a family member, usually their fathers, to fix their DIY disaster.

But all is not lost. Around a fifth of British men are competent enough to carry out DIY themselves and are often asked for advice by others.

And the same number are graceful enough to accept they have no aptitude for practical skills and get someone in to do the work for them.
