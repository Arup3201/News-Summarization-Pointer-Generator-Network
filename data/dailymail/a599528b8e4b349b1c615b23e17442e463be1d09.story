Guilty: Senior counter-terrorism detective April Casburn was yesterday found guilty of trying to sell information to the News of the World. Casburn is pictured leaving court yesterday

A senior counter-terrorism officer was facing jail last night after being convicted of offering to sell inside information about the phone-hacking investigation to the News of the World.

Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn rang the newspaper days after Scotland Yard began a review of evidence that its journalists had illegally intercepted mobile phone messages.

Casburn, 53, who worked for the Met’s SO15 counter-terrorism command, is the first person convicted as part of Operation Elveden, the multi-million pound investigation into whether journalists illegally paid public officials for information.

So far, 53 people have been arrested.

The £65,000-a-year officer was found guilty of misconduct in public office at the end of a three-day trial.

Judge Mr Justice Fulford told Casburn, who has a three-year-old adopted child, that her actions were a ‘substantial breach of trust’ and there was a ‘real possibility’ that she would face prison.

Social workers will write a report about the child’s future before she is sentenced. She faces dismissal from the Met and being stripped of much of her pension.

Casburn, who has two grown-up sons from her first marriage, had a ‘difficult divorce’ from her second husband and had undergone two failed IVF attempts when she made the phone call to the News of the World in September 2010, the court heard.

In 2011 she was off work for two months with ‘situation stress’ following claims of bullying by male bosses within SO15, with one superintendent admitting in evidence that he sent her text messages signed with kisses.

Casburn returned to work that October, saying she was not well but feared that her adoption application with her third husband would be affected.

Prosecuted: Casburn was told she could face an 'immediate custodial sentence. She previously admitted going to the News of the World was a 'foolish decision'

When arrested in the December, she was
on adoption leave and her only worry was for the toddler, who had lived
with her in Chelmsford, Essex for just a few days.

Casburn told Southwark Crown Court that working in the Met’s Terror 
Command was like working in a ‘21st century Life on Mars’ after the BBC 
television show that depicts sexist attitudes of the police in the 
1970s.

After the verdict, Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Briggs 
said: ‘It’s a great disappointment that a DCI in the counter-terror 
command should have abused her position in this way.

Firm: Speaking outside court, Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Briggs said it is unacceptable for a serving police officer to leak confidential information to journalists for private gain

Claims: Casburn told jurors that some of her colleagues were excited about meeting Sienna Miller, pictured

There’s no place 
for corrupt officers or staff in the Metropolitan Police Service. She 
betrayed the service and let down her colleagues.’

Casburn had rung the News of the World news desk and revealed details 
about Operation Varec, the police investigation into phone hacking at 
the now defunct Sunday paper.

She told journalist Tim Wood that six people were under suspicion 
including former editor Andy Coulson, at that time David Cameron’s 
communications chief. She said detectives were under pressure from Lord 
[John] Prescott and the operation was a waste of resources. Mr Wood 
emailed two colleagues to say a ‘senior police woman’ wanted to ‘sell 
inside information’.

This email was handed to the police by the paper’s publisher, News 
International, and Casburn was arrested. The News of the World did not 
publish any information and did not pay Casburn.

The Met reopened its phone-hacking probe after reports that it was more 
widespread than had been admitted following the conviction of the 
paper’s former royal correspondent Clive Goodman and private 
investigator Glenn Mulcaire for intercepting voicemails in what was 
described as an isolated case of ‘rogue reporting’.

The newspaper closed in July 2011. Dozens of politicians, celebrities 
and victims of crime who had their voicemails intercepted have since 
accepted out-of-court settlements worth millions of pounds.

Accusations: The detective, who joined the force in 1993, claimed she feared colleagues saw the phone hacking probe as 'a bit of fun'
