It's news that might spark a little celebration – if you own a home in London.

The average cost of a house in the capital has now topped £400,000 for the first time following a record 25.8 per cent price increase.

But while for Londoners it could mean cashing in on a nice little investment as prices boom, the rest of the country can only expect a more modest dividend.

There is now a gap of more than £200,000 between a property in the UK’s largest city and elsewhere – where the average price of a home is just £185,478.

The average cost of a home in London has now topped £400,000 following a record increase

The gulf in Britain’s two-speed housing market was laid bare yesterday in a report by Nationwide, which said the gap is ‘the widest that it has ever been’.

In 12 months, prices in London have jumped by nearly £100,000 to £400,404. For house-hunters the sum may only buy a tiny studio flat or a garage in many areas, but for homeowners their properties will have ‘earned’ four times the annual salary of a typical full-time worker.

Overall, house prices in the UK including London are rising by 11.8 per cent, the fastest rate of annual growth for nearly a decade following 14 consecutive monthly rises, raising the average cost  to £188,903. 

But this increase is overshadowed by rocketing prices in the capital only, which is seeing the fastest rate of growth since 1987.

In 1975 – the year that Nationwide started to keep figures – prices in the metropolis were 30 per cent higher than the rest of the UK.

Today they are a record-breaking 116 per cent higher, a boon for any Londoner who wants to sell and buy elsewhere in Britain.

Alex Hilton, of tenants’ campaign group Generation Rent, said it might lead to an exodus of ‘talented people’ who need to work in the capital but cannot afford to live nearby.

For the Treasury, however, the boom in London house prices means a welcome boost in stamp duty receipts.

Homebuyers in the capital paid £2billion in 2012/13, the largest amount in a year in any part of the UK, according to HM Revenue and Customs.

The Nationwide report comes just days after the Bank of England tried to cool the housing market with new lending rules.

Robert Gardner, chief economist at the building society, said it does not resolve the biggest problem – the lack of supply of new homes.

Matthew Pointon, of the consultancy Capital Economics, said London was in ‘distinctly bubble-like territory’. But Paul Smith, of estate agents Haart, said: ‘Bubbles burst and London house prices – while completely unaffordable to many – are not about to collapse.’ 

While the cost of homes has rocketed in London, in many areas they are still far below pre-financial crisis levels, the Office for National Statistics said in a separate report yesterday.

Prices are lower than they were at their peak in areas including the North of England, the Midlands, the South West, Scotland and Wales, it said.

The cost of a mortgage is also beginning to climb ahead of an expected Bank of England interest rate rise.

Rates for the best two-year fixed-rate deal for a home buyer with a 20 per cent deposit have risen from 1.99 per cent to 2.19 per cent in a month, research by analysts Moneyfacts found.
