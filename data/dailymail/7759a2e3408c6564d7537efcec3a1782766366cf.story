Conservative publisher and author Andrew Breitbart, the former editor of Drudge report has died, aged 43.

Breitbart who published the infamous tweets that brought down former Representative Anthony Weiner, died 'unexpectedly from natural causes' this morning in Los Angeles.

His death was confirmed by Breitbart.com editor-in-chief Joel Pollak, who says he was at the hospital, and by the Los Angeles County coroner's office.

Breitbart was walking near his house in the Brentwood neighborhood shortly after midnight Thursday when he collapsed, his father-in-law Orson Bean said.

Someone saw him fall and called paramedics, who tried to revive him. They rushed him to the emergency room at UCLA Medical Center, Bean said.

Breitbart had suffered heart problems a year earlier, but Bean said he could not pinpoint what happened.

'I don't know what to say. It's devastating,' Bean told The Associated Press.

He is survived by his wife Susannah Bean Breitbart, 41, and four children.

Loving father: Breitbart had suffered heart problems a year earlier

A statement on his website bigjournalism.com read: 'With a terrible feeling of pain and loss we announce the passing of Andrew Breitbart.

We have lost a husband, a father, a son, a brother, a dear friend, a patriot and a happy warrior.

Andrew lived boldly, so that we more timid souls would dare to live freely and fully, and fight for the fragile liberty he showed us how to love.

Andrew recently wrote a new conclusion to his book, Righteous Indignation:

''I love my job. I love fighting for what I believe in. I love having fun while doing it. I love reporting stories that the Complex refuses to report. I love fighting back, I love finding allies, and—famously—I enjoy making enemies.

Three years ago, I was mostly a behind-the-scenes guy who linked to stuff on a very popular website. I always wondered what it would be like to enter the public realm to fight for what I believe in. I’ve lost friends, perhaps dozens. But I’ve gained hundreds, thousands—who knows?—of allies. At the end of the day, I can look at myself in the mirror, and I sleep very well at night.''

Andrew is at rest, yet the happy warrior lives on, in each of us.'

Arianna Huffington, who hired 
Breitbart in 1997 and gave him an instrumental role in launching the 
Huffington Post today paid tribute to the conservative activist on the 
site.

Entrepeneur: Andrew Breitbart set up a series of news websites of his own including Breitbart.com, Breitbart.tv, Big Hollywood, Big Government, Big Journalism and Big Peace

She wrote: 'I was asked many times 
this morning for my thoughts on what Andrew meant to the political 
world, but all I can think of at the moment is what Andrew meant to me 
as a friend, starting from when we worked together -- his passion, his 
exuberance, his fearlessness. And above all, what I'm thinking of at the
 moment is his amazing wife Susie and their four beautiful young 
children. My love and thoughts are with them right now.'

The provocative publisher was also 
the proprietor of his own stable of right-leaning news websites 
including Breitbart.com, Breitbart.tv, Big Hollywood, Big Government, 
Big Journalism and Big Peace.

Big Government is best known for 
breaking and reporting the ACORN child sex trafficking scandal and for 
exposing last year's 'Weinergate' scandal.

Breitbart was an outspoken critic of the mainstream media. His efforts were behind controversial investigations that led to the resignations of former Rep. Anthony Weiner and former Agriculture Department official Shirley Sherrod.

He was lionised by his fans for his efforts at exposing government corruption and media bias.

Breitbart was at the center of two video controversies in recent years - one that led to the firing of an Agriculture Department employee over an edited video of what appeared to be a racist remark, and another that embarrassed the community group ACORN when workers were shown counseling actors posing as a prostitute and pimp.

Breitbart is known for disseminating an edited video that showed an Agriculture Department employee making what appeared to be racist remarks.

Sherrod, who is black, was fired from 
her job as Georgia state rural development director in July 2010 after 
the video surfaced. She is seen telling a local NAACP group that she was
 initially reluctant to help a white farmer save his farm more than two 
decades ago, long before she worked for USDA.

Missing from the clip was the rest of
 the speech, which was meant as a lesson in racial healing. Sherrod told
 the crowd she eventually realized her mistake and helped the farmer 
save his farm. She has since filed a lawsuit against Breitbart.

Breitbart's websites also featured a 
2009 hidden-camera sting video that brought embarrassment to the 
community group ACORN. The videos show ACORN staffers offering advice on
 taxes and other issues to actors posing as a prostitute and pimp.

Those videos triggered a firestorm of
 criticism, with some ACORN employees appearing willing to support 
illegal schemes involving tax advice, misuse of public funds and illegal
 trafficking in children.

An internal review later concluded 
the videos 'feed the impression that ACORN believes it is above the 
law.' The internal investigation and a Government Accountability Office 
report cleared ACORN of criminal activities.

Even so, public pressure led Congress
 to block previously approved funds from going to ACORN and to stop 
future payments. Roughly 10 percent of ACORN's funds came from federal 
grants and the group eventually disbanded.

Breitbart also sparked a controversy 
that ultimately led to Weiner's resignation. His problems began on May 
28 when Bretibart's biggovernment.com posted a lewd photograph of an 
underwear-clad crotch and said it had been sent from Weiner's Twitter 
account to a Seattle woman.

Strong character: Breitbart also had his own radio show which he used to put forward his opinions

Initially, Weiner lied, saying his account had been hacked. But he pointedly did not report the incident to law enforcement — a step that could have led the way to charges of wrongdoing far more serious than mere sexting.

Additionally, his public denials were less than solid — particularly when he told an interviewer that he could not 'say with certitude' that he wasn't the man in the underwear photo.

Weiner's spokesman said the photo was just 'a distraction' and that the congressman 'doesn't know the person named by the hacker.'

The congressman denied sending the photo and said he had retained an attorney and hired a private security company to figure out how someone could pull off such a prank.

But Weiner dropped that story line on June 6, offering a lengthy public confession at a Manhattan news conference, acknowledging to online activity involving at least six women.

It was a remarkable turn of events for the brash Weiner, who conceded to a 'hugely regrettable' lapse in judgment.

'I called you a putz cause I thought you were being intentionally disingenuous. If not I apologize'

Breitbart seldom showed restraint in his vitriol to his critics and seemed to relish in the negative attention his antics earned him. After Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts died in 2009, Breitbart tweeted 'Rest in Chappaquiddick' and called him 'a special pile of human excrement.' When critics questioned his tone, he tweeted they 'missed my best ones!'

Breitbart's final tweet, posted shortly before he died, exemplified the agressive manner he took with fellow commenators. 'I called you a putz cause I thought you were being intentionally disingenuous. If not I apologize,' he wrote in response to a Twitter user he had been disagreeing with.

News of the prolific commentator's death resounded in political circles. Rick Santorum told Fox News he was 'crestfallen.'

'What a powerful force,' Santorum said. 'What a huge loss, in my opinion, for our country and certainly for the conservative movement.'

'RIP `O Mighty Warrior!' Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a message on Twitter, Media Matters, the liberal watchdog that was a frequent Breitbart critic, said the organization's 'thoughts and prayers are with his family today.''We've disagreed more than we've found common ground, but there was never any question of Andrew's passion for and commitment to what he believed,' said Media Matters' Ari Rabin-Havt.Mitt Romney posted to Twitter: 'Ann and I are deeply saddened by the passing of (at)AndrewBreitbart: brilliant entrepreneur, fearless conservative, loving husband and father.'Newt Gingrich tweeted: 'Andrew Breitbart was the most innovative pioneer in conservative activist social media in America. He had great courage and creativity.'

His newest book 'Righteous Indignation: Excuse Me While I Save the World!' was on the New York Times bestseller list.

Previous books include his well received expose of celebrity culture, 'Hollywood, Interrupted.'
