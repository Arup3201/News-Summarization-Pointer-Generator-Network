On the night where Manchester United crashed out of the FA Cup, former midfielder Paul Pogba showed his former side exactly what they are missing as his spectacular half-volley secured victory for Juventus against Sassuolo.

The 21-year-old struck eight minutes from full-time as the Italian giants went 11 points clear at the top - ending a two-match winless streak in the process - as they edged past Eusebio Di Francesco's men on Monday night.

A 1-1 draw with Roma in their last league match, coupled by losing their long-standing unbeaten home record the game before against Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia semi-finals, meant they went into the game with a point to prove.

It looked like the three-time defending champions were in for another frustrating evening, before Pogba broke the deadlock with his first goal since January.

In the 82nd minute at the Juventus Stadium, Pogba took a pass from Simone Pepe, used one touch to control the bouncing ball and then pounded it into the back of the net from beyond the area with his next touch.

After the game a delighted Pogba admitted: 'It was a very, very difficult match. I can still do more too. I've got to continue working hard to become a great player.'
