Thieves dismantled and made off with an entire garage after breaking into an 85-year-old stroke victim's lock-up and finding nothing worth stealing.

The crooks broke into the large shed, big enough to hold a car, in Wigan, Lancashire, but were confronted with piles of wood and old furniture.

Instead of fleeing empty-handed they then took apart the pensioner's entire garage.

Thieves in Lancashire who broke into a man's lock-up were so disappointed with the loot inside they left it behind and stole the garage instead. Pictured here is the spot where the garage was

Police said the thieves took down the wood and metal walls and roof and fled with them - leaving most of its contents behind.

Officers in Golborne say the owner has been left devastated following the theft which happened between Sunday and Tuesday.

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'It is very unusual that the whole garage has been stolen. There are around 30 or 40 similar lock-ups down there.

'Some are made of wood, others are metal. Officers confirmed that a large structure had been taken.'
