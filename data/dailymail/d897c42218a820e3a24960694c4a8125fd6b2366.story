Nine goals, two red cards and a comical goalkeeping error - who said Italian football was boring?

A breathtaking match at the Stadio Ennio Tardini saw Filippo Inzaghi's AC Milan continue their promising start to the Serie A season by edging Parma 5-4.

Strikes from Giacorno Bonaventura and Keisuke Honda, a breathtaking run and finish from Nigel de Jong and a brace from Jeremy Menez - one from the spot, another a quite sublime backheel - ensured Milan joined Roma and Juventus at the top of the table.

For De Jong's goal, the former Manchester City midfielder won the ball in the middle of the park and ran completely unopposed from the halfway-line towards the Parma goal. He then slotted the ball superbly past the advancing Mirante. 

Menez, meanwhile, capitalised on a defensive mistake to nick the ball ahead of the Parma goalkeeper, slip it past him and, despite running away from goal, audaciously backheel the ball into the net. 

And all of this happened despite on-loan Chelsea striker Fernando Torres being unable to make his debut due to a sprained ankle.

For their part, Parma also contributed to an extremely entertaining encounter. Antonio Cassano netted against his old side, with Felipe and Alessandro Lucarelli also getting their names on the scoresheet.

But it was Milan's own misgivings that led to a nervy finish. With the score at 5-3, defender Mattia De Sciglio passed the ball back towards goalkeeper Diego Lopez, who slipped horribly when attempting a clearance. The ball then rolled past the keeper and into the net.

A visibly embarrassed Lopez held his hamstring in pain but thankfully for him Milan were able to hold out for victory.

Amazingly, both sides also ended the match with just 10 men.

Milan's Daniele Bonera and Parma's Felipe were both dismissed after collecting two bookings each.

Interestingly, the last time Milan won their opening two matches was eight years ago - also against Lazio and Parma.
