The first athletes to compete in the Winter Olympics took to the slopes today as the Russian government issued further assurances it is doing everything possible to ensure the Sochi Games are as safe as possible.

The first competitions started more than 24 hours before the official Opening Ceremony on Friday to accommodate the 12 new men's and women's medal events added since the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.

The men's snowboard slopestyle qualifying runs were the first to get underway this morning at the X-Treme Park in the mountains above Sochi - with athletes performing incredible stunts and jumps.

They were followed by the women's qualifying runs and the women's moguls freestyle skiing this afternoon. The two events will be among the first medals to be awarded on Saturday.

Down in Sochi, the new team figure skating competition will also start this afternoon at the Iceberg Skating Palace. The men's short program is to be followed by the pairs.

But despite an action-packed day of sport, much focus still surrounded the terror threats leading up to the Games. The Russian government says it's doing everything possible to make sure the Sochi Games are as safe as possible.

Dmitry Kozak, Russia's deputy prime minister, said: 'We can guarantee the safety of the people as well as any other government hosting a mass event (can).'

Kozak today spoke about the steps Russia is taking to collaborate with nations across the globe to build a database on potential terrorists. He says that 'there is no reason to believe Sochi, in Russia, is under more threat than any other city in the world'.

Security concerns have been at the forefront of the Sochi Games for months. They were renewed this week when the U.S. Homeland Security Department warned airlines flying to Russia that terrorists may try to smuggle explosives into the country in tubes of toothpaste.

Kozak says the fear of terrorism is always present at big sporting events, in Russia or anywhere else. But he also believes 'the level of fear should be lower' surrounding the Sochi Games. 

Protesters in cities around the world
 targeted major Olympic sponsors on Wednesday, urging them to speak out 
against the Russian law.

The
 law, signed in July by President Vladimir Putin, outlaws pro-gay 
'propaganda' that could be accessible to minors. Critics say it is so 
restrictive and vague that it deters almost any public expression of 
support for gay rights.

Kozak said Russian organizers will not 
discriminate against visitors or athletes because of their sexuality, 
but he backed the government's support for the so-called gay propaganda 
law.

Kozak said 
athletes are free to express their views and discuss their sexuality. 
However, he asked them to stay away from children, saying 'leave the 
kids alone'.

His comments comes as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned attacks against homosexuals. In a speech to the IOC today.

Ban said many professional athletes, gay and straight, are speaking out against prejudice and discrimination.

'We must all raise our voices against attacks on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex people,' he said. 'We must oppose the arrests, imprisonments and discriminatory restrictions they face.'

Ban's remarks came at a time when activists and protesters have stepped up their campaign against Russia's law restricting gay rights activities.

Human Rights Watch posted a video this week on YouTube of gay people in Russia being bullied, chased and beaten, compiled from footage the group said was uploaded by perpetrators.

'Hatred of any kind must have no place in the 21st century,' Ban said.

The U.N. chief noted that Principle 6 of the Olympic Charter enshrines the IOC's opposition to any form of discrimination.

'The Olympics show the power of sport to bring together individuals regardless of age, race, class, religion, ability, sex, sexual orientation or gender identity,' Ban said.

'I know that there has been some controversy over this issue,' Ban told reporters after his speech. 'At the same time, I appreciate President Putin for his assurance that there will be no discrimination whatsoever and the people with different sexual orientation are welcome to compete and enjoy this Olympic Games.'

'I hope that this Olympics will be the venue where all the people, regardless of sexual orientation, LGBT and all of these people will really be able to enjoy the harmony and friendship, mutual respect and compete in the spirit of the Olympic movement,' he added. 

Ban's visit to Sochi comes as several world leaders decided to skip the games, including British Prime Minister David Cameron, U.S. President Barack Obama, German President Joachim Gauck and French President Francois Hollande.

Although the chief organizer of the Sochi Olympics says a record number of world leaders are still attending.

Dmitry Chernyshenko says 65 heads of state and government and international organizations are expected to attend Russia's first Winter Olympics.

He says it's a record for Winter Games and three times the number of leaders who attended the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver. 

But spectators arriving in Sochi so far seem to be mainly Russian.

Dina Kobolenko, who works at a tourist information stand near the Sochi train station, says she's seen only a single foreigner - a South Korean.

Fears about terrorism and the hassle of reaching Sochi from points abroad may be keeping some foreigners away - and undermining Vladimir Putin's plans to transform Sochi into a magnet for international tourism.

A train traveling between Olympic sites and downtown Sochi cheerily announces to visitors in English: 'We wish you a pleasant journey!' But on a recent ride, its seats were half empty. And a sweep through four train cars found ... not a single foreign fan.
