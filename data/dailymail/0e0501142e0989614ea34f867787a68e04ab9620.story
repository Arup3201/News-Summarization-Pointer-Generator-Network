Former Standard Liege boss Guy Luzon has been appointed as Charlton's new Head Coach, the club confirmed on Tuesday evening.

The 39-year-old will replace Bob Peeters, who was sacked on Sunday after a dismal run of six wins from 25 Championship league games, and has signed an initial contract until the end of the 2015/16 season 

'I am happy to have joined Charlton and will work as hard as I can to try and make the club successful,' Luzon told the club's official website.

'We have talented players in the squad and it is my job to try and bring the best out of them.

'It is important to have a positive spirit in the team and I want to ensure the entire group is fighting together for the good of the club.

'I look forward to taking training for the first time and getting my ideas across to the players.'

Luzon will be officially unveiled at a press conference at The Valley on Wednesday and will take charge of the Addicks for the first time at Watford on Saturday (3pm).

Charlton owner Roland Duchâtelet said: 'I think the appointment of Guy Luzon will prove to be a very good one for the club.

'I regard him as an extremely talented coach who has already achieved a lot in his career so far.

'There were a lot of records broken during his first season at Standard Liège and they had the best defensive record in the league.

'He is a passionate coach who will give his all to Charlton and I hope supporters will get behind him.' 

The Israeli coach had the best defensive record in the Belgian league, conceding just 17 goals in 13 matches

Luzon led Standard Liège  to first place in the Jupiler Pro League during the regular season. They conceded just 17 goals in 30 matches – a record for the Belgian league in its current format – and kept 18 clean sheets during that period.

The Israeli coach has previously managed a series of clubs in his home country and guided Maccabi Petah Tivka to second place in the top flight. 

He also had a successful spell in charge of the Israel U21 side where he led them to the European U21 Championship in 2013.
