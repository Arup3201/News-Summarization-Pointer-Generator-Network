Newly-released footage taken from police body cameras have revealed the dramatic moment officers opened fire on a former NFL player as he was apparently about to stab his girlfriend.

The video shows two officers shooting former New York Giants recruit Jermaine Green, 32, six times as he held Katrina Johnson, 37, at knifepoint in a home in Daytona Beach, Florida in September.

Both sustained non-fatal gunshot wounds; Green was shot in the hip, abdomen and right arm, while Johnson was hit with a seventh bullet in her right arm, the footage shows.

It was released as authorities investigate whether officers Richard Maher and Kevin Connelly were justified in opening fire during the September 25 incident.

Tense: Officers can be seen raising their weapons as they head towards a domestic dispute in Florida

Struggle: In the bedroom they find Jermaine Green pinning his girlfriend Katrina Johnson down on top of him. The former NFL player has her in a choke hold with his left arm and a knife in his right hand

'I'm proud of what the officers did,' Dayton Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood told the Orlando Sentinel. 'Everybody went home to their families.'

Three officers had been called to the home just after 3am after receiving two 911 calls about a fight and domestic dispute between the couple, the Daytona News-Journal reported.

Chitwood said the row between Green and Johnson had started a day earlier when Green allegedly hit his girlfriend over the head with a brick, although this was not reported to police.

Officers arrived at the home to find concerned relatives running from the home in their pjamas. They tell the pair that they had tried to stop the fight but that Green had gone 'crazy'.

The footage shows them kicking the 
door down to see Green, who then pulls Johnson into a bedroom. With 
their weapons raised, they inch into the room.

Danger: He brings down his right hand - carrying the knife - and misses her but the police begin to shoot

Chaos: Green was hit multiple times and Johnson is seen trying to get away after being shot in the arm

Hurt: Green lies beside the bed - he was shot in the hip, the arm and the abdomen but has recovered

There,
they see Green laying on the bed with his girlfriend pulled down on top
of him in a choke hold with his left arm. His right hand is gripping a 
large knife held over Johnson's chest.

'Let her go dude, let her go,' one officer yells. 'Let her go man, I'm telling you right now.'

They see Green raise his right arm slightly and then come down rapidly - in an apparent attempt to stab his girlfriend.

'He's doing it,' the policeman said to his partner - before seven shots rang out in the room.

What follows is chaos as both Green and Johnson are hit in the series of bright flashes. One officer helps Johnson get up, but Green remains slumped on the floor.

They were taken to Halifax Health Medical Center, where Green was listed in critical condition and was in the intensive care unit for several days.

Johnson's injury was not serious but she has threatened to sue the Police Department over the shooting, the Daytona News-Journal reported.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is now investigating the use of deadly force by the officers. When the investigation is complete, it will be sent to the State Attorney's Office.

After the incident, the officers were placed on paid administrative leave for a few days but have been back on duty for nearly a month.

Green, who played for Washington State then the Giants, is being held without bail at the Volusia County Branch Jail on charges including kidnapping and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

Since 2002, Green has been arrested nine times, including for domestic battery in 2010.
