Pregnant Josie Cunningham, who has cancelled tickets to the birth of her child after finding out she was expecting a girl 

Pregnant wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has revealed she is to quit smoking and drinking and has cancelled tickets to the birth of her child after finding out she is expecting a girl.

The 24-year-old, who rose to fame after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, had originally thought that her third child, due in October, was to be a boy. 

She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted' to discover it wasn't the little girl she'd hoped for.

Then last month she announced to her 54,000 Twitter fans that the four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000.

She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink.

Doctors had originally told Ms Cunningham, from Leeds that she was expecting a third boy but she asked for a second opinion after using a home scan kit which said she was expecting a girl.

It is now thought she is indeed expecting a girl and has had a change of heart, cancelling the tickets, saying she wants to look after herself.

She told the Sunday Mirror: 'I want to enjoy my precious first few moments alone with my daughter and my mum - not share them with the world.

'I've really started looking after myself. I have never purposely put my child at any risk, but when I was originally told I was having a boy I just lost all willpower to avoid cravings. 

'I've now cut down to just one or two fags a day. I'm about to get hypnotherapy to stop completely.'

It is thought that three of the four tickets to be at the birth were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

Two had been sold for £10,000 each while the other two sold for £5,000 each.

However, Ms Cunningham had suggested that some of the cash from the event could have been used to reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery.

Ms Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. 

The 24-year-old had previously admitted smoking a packet of cigarettes and having a glass of wine after she was told she was expecting a boy 

Ms Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

The mother-of-two later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

Earlier this month she made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public.

She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation.

She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’.

It comes after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for.

As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont).

'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice.
