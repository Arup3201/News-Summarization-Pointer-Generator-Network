It is the most famous ship in the world and the tale of its doomed maiden voyage has spawned countless books, blogs and one of the most lucrative films in history.

But a unique project to colour original black and white images has shown The Titanic in a different light.

Russian photo editor Anton Logvynenko has breathed new life into the story of the iconic ship by painstakingly colouring in the photographs.

Majestic: New life has been breathed into The Titanic by photo editor Anton Logvynenko who painstakingly coloured in black and white images of the doomed ship

Impressive: The liner has been authentically coloured in Mr Logvynenko's project that he started to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its sinking

Awesome: The photo editor even coloured in the well-wishers who gathered to wave farewell to The Titanic

Mr Logvynenko took original images and used current technology to give them authentic colour.

The project was launched to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the doomed voyage last year but has grown in popularity this month after being shared on a number of blogs.

The RMS Titanic was one of the most opulent liners to have ever been built and the largest steamship in the world.

It struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City and sank on April 15, 1912.

A total of 1,517 people died in the disaster.

As well as its tragic end The Titanic is renowned for the luxury on board. Mr Logvynenko's project shows the quality of the interior to amazing effect.

The luxurious interior of the ship resembled the contemporary style of leading hotels such The Ritz and the dining rooms were decorated with ornate ceilings and plush carpets.

The first class cabins resembled rooms from the finest hotels.

Mr
 Logvynenko has been able to bring out the sumptuousness of the bedding 
and carpets and artistry of the decoration of the first class rooms.

Opulence: The luxury of the first class and even second class cabins have been brought to life in Mr Logvynenko's astonishing pictures

Stylish: The Titanic's Cafe Parisien is shown in its original splendour in this coloured photograph where the ivy and ornate ceiling stand out far more than in black and white

Keep fit: Passengers on the luxury liner could enjoy state-of-the-art facilities including a gymnasium (pictured), Turkish bath and telephone

Ornate: Mr Logvnenko chose green and gold decoration to illustrate the opulence of the suites. Tickets for suites would have cost up to £870 in high season (£72,932 today)

Expensive: The Titanic's designers wanted their liner to resemble a fine hotel on water with the highest stands of luxury

Dinner time: The dining room, painted here with white walls and green chairs, was a grand room

Among the photographs used in the Titanic In Color series are of a man in fine white sports gear shown on the rowing machine on the liner's gym.

Elsewhere, passengers could use a library, visit the barbers or go swimming in the ship's pool. There was also a squash court, Turkish bath and electric bath.

A black and white image of the Titanic's Cafe Parisien has also been restored in colour. 

The table tops of the cafe, that was meant to resemble a sidewalk cafe in Paris, have been coloured in greens, pinks and reds.

Ivy growing up the 
walls is barely noticeable in the colourless picture but suddenly 
stands out in Mr Logvynenko's version. 

The awesome scale of the ship's construction is also brought to life in the project.

Whether it is a picture of The Titanic in the gantry at Belfast or after it has set sail from Southampton, the images convey the majesty of the liner before its demise.
