A college lacrosse player has been arrested for allegedly stealing a truck, kidnapping a woman and smashing into nine cars before telling a police officer he wanted to see 'what it was really like to play the video game Grand Theft Auto'.

Zachary Burgess, 20, was arrested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana at 2.30am on Saturday when officers responded to a report of a stolen vehicle and erratic driving in the Tigerland area.

The Auburn University student, who was in town to watch Auburn take on LSU, allegedly stole the truck after its owner left it running in a bar parking lot with a woman inside.

Burgess allegedly jumped into the driver's seat and tried to speed from the parking lot. But he faced a problem - other parked cars in his way.

'When he tried to flee the parking lot 
there were several cars blocking the way,' Cpl. Don Coppola of the Baton
Rouge Police Department told NBC33. 'He began ramming into the parked 
cars.'

Burgess, an Auburn freshman from Hoover, Alabama, allegedly struck nine vehicles in total.

Afterwards, he fled the scene 'with no signs of him intending to return the truck to the rightful owner,' the police report noted.

When officers arrived at the parking lot, the vehicle was found abandoned a few yards away and a group of witnesses were holding the 
suspect, Cpl. Coppola said.

The woman told officers that Burgess 
'forcibly' held her captive in the truck but she was able to jump out 
and run to safety, Coppola said.

During questioning Burgess allegedly told
a police officer that he 'wanted to see what it was really like to play the 
video game Grand Theft Auto', NBC33 reported.

He was arrested and charged with theft of a motor vehicle, kidnapping and nine counts of hit and run, and he was released on Sunday after posting the $80,000 bond.

No one was hurt in the incident.

Grand Theft Auto is an award-winning video game series in which players take on the role of a criminal and rise up the ranks of organized crime by stealing cars, racing and shooting.
