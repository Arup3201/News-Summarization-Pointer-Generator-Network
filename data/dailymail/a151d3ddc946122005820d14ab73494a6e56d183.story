Nearly two months ago Ultramarathon burns survivor Turia Pitt reached a confidential multi-million dollar settlement deal with organisers of the marathon in which she nearly lost her life.

Ms Pitt suffered burns to more than 60 percent of her body after she became trapped in a bushfire during an outback marathon in the Kimberly Region of Western Australia in 2011.

Now, The Daily Telegraph reports that the settlement agreement has still not been signed by Hong Kong based company Racing The Planet, and the 26-year-old is yet to receive a cent.

Turia Pitt's legal battle with organisers of the race that left her with life-threatening burns is still ongoing

On Wednesday Ms Pitt's lawyers fronted the Supreme Court, and have now lodged a motion to enforce the settlement agreement in court. They have until Friday to submit any evidence supporting its case.

Racing the Planet have still refused to pay the woman's astronomical medical bills, even after a West Australian inquiry slammed the company's disastrous handling of the tragedy.

Greg Walsh, Ms Pitt's lawyer told the publication the former model is very distressed that the company are refusing to sign the settlement.

The agreement was finalised on May 29, and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.

At the time, Ms Pitt's boyfriend Michael Hoskin said it was settled through mediation and the couple were glad the process was over.

He told 60 Minutes the couple were glad they could move forward from the terrible hardship of the past few years, and he was grateful they would not have to think about the court case again.

However with the settlement still dragging on the pair may have to wait a little longer, as the case was adjourned to next Tuesday.

Ms Pitt launched the court action in February last year after a WA parliamentary inquiry found Hong Kong-based Racing The Planet did not take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of competitors.

In 2012 Ms Pitt and fellow competitor Kate Sanderson - who also suffered severe burns during the race - were awarded $450,000 by the WA government as an 'Act of Grace'.

Western Australia Tourism Minister Dr Kim Hames said that the money was to 'assist in alleviating their financial stress while they explore other options.'

However two months later the company have still not signed the deal nor paid her any compensation for the accident which left her with burns to 64 percent of her body

Ms Pitt, who was working in mining engineering when she entered the marathon race, told a 2012 inquiry that she wasn't even planning to enter the event because she thought the entry fee was ridiculous.

But two weeks before the marathon on September 2 2011, she was invited by organisers to compete for free.

She was joined in the event by adventure enthusiast Ms Sanderson and 40 other runners who were destined to run across the parched outback Kimberley region of north west Australia.

But part-way through the race Ms Pitt and Ms Sanderson, along with two male competitors, became trapped by a bushfire in a narrow, rocky gorge.

Ms Pitt underwent countless operations and took on enormous medical bills during her ongoing recovery

Ms Pitt's injuries were so bad that not only did she suffer burns to 64 per cent of her body, she also had four fingers from her left hand and her right thumb amputated.

They told the inquiry earlier they had no idea they were running into danger because the organisers had spoken only 'in passing' about spot fires.

Ms Pitt said she and Ms Sanderson would have died at the gorge if not for a risky rescue mission undertaken by a helicopter crew.
