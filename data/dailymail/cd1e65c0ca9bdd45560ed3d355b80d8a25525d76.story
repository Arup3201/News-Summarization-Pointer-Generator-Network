The average Wall Street bonus rose two percent in 2014 as hiring in New York City's financial sector picked up, according to a government report on Wednesday.

The average bonus for New York City's security industry rose to $172,860 in 2014, the highest level since the financial crisis, said a report by the office of the New York State Comptroller.

The loftier bonuses came despite a 4.5 percent drop in broker/dealer profits in 2014 to $16 billion, the report said.

The decline in profits was due to weakness in some trading divisions, costly legal settlements at large banks and higher capital reserve requirements imposed by regulators after the financial crisis.

The industry added 2,300 jobs in New York City in 2014, the first year of positive job growth in the sector since 2011.

'The cost of legal settlements related to the 2008 financial crisis continues to be a drag on Wall Street profits, but the securities industry remains profitable and well-compensated even as it adjusts to regulatory changes,' said New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.

'The resumption of job growth in the securities industry bodes well for New York's economy, but it remains to be seen whether this trend will be sustained.'

'One area that anecdotally we keep hearing is a growth sector is compliance,' DiNapoli said. 

The average increase in bonuses in 2014 was well below the rise notched in the previous two years.

Average bonuses fell from a peak of $191,360 on average in 2006 to $100,850 in 2008 during the financial crisis.

The average salary including bonuses on Wall Street was $355,500 in 2013, according to an October report from the comptroller's office.

'The compensation is five times the average for private employment in the city,' DiNapoli said. 'But it's a challenging work environment, and in recent years because of the downsizing it's been harder to get these positions.'

Authorities have blamed inflated mortgage-backed securities that plummeted along with the U.S. housing market for the financial crisis in 2008.

Regulatory reforms since have included larger reserve requirements, new limits on proprietary trading and measures intended to reduce risk. Securities firms now pay a smaller share of bonuses in the current year with more deferred. 

DiNapoli added that it's important to be concerned about excessive risk-taking and possible regulatory rollbacks to be sure there isn't another meltdown, noting the industry is key to the economic viability of the city and state. 

The goal should be a business model with sustainable profits, he said, not the short-term, high-risk, high-reward profits 'that invariably results in the periodic downturn or crash as we had.'
