Stephen Lawrence: A 20th anniversary memorial service will take place later this month

The extraordinary impact of the Daily Mail’s marathon Stephen Lawrence campaign has been acknowledged in an independent poll marking the 20th anniversary of his murder.

Two thirds of those questioned about the teenager’s racist killing said the media had played a key role in keeping the case in the spotlight.

They added this showed campaigning journalism can act as a force for good in Britain.

Details of the poll, commissioned by the think-tank British Future, emerged only a few weeks after one of Stephen’s killers finally admitted defeat in his battle to clear his name.

Gary Dobson, 37, one of two men jailed for life last year over Stephen’s racist killing, dropped his appeal against conviction.

His decision was welcomed by Stephen’s mother Doreen Lawrence, who urged the other man jailed for her son’s murder, David Norris, 36, to follow Dobson’s  example and drop his appeal.

Dobson’s decision to throw in the towel was a victory for the Daily Mail, which for 16 years has campaigned for justice for Stephen.

In February 1997, we famously published pictures of the five prime suspects – Dobson, Norris, Neil Acourt, Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight – under the headline ‘Murderers’ and challenged them to sue us if we were wrong. No legal action was ever taken. We repeated the front page in July 2006, and again none of the race-hate yobs issued legal proceedings.

Our acclaimed campaign exposed police failings and led to the setting up of a public inquiry which branded the Met ‘institutionally racist’, and changes in the justice system which allowed Dobson, previously acquitted of Stephen’s murder, to stand trial again. After the two men were found guilty of Stephen’s murder in January last year, Dobson was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years and two months, while Norris was given a minimum of 14 years and three months.

As Stephen’s family prepares for what is likely to be a hugely poignant memorial service on April 22, marking exactly two decades since his murder, British Future released the findings of a poll it commissioned about the case.

It surveyed a representative sample of 2,000 adults across Britain. Sixty-seven per cent of those questioned agreed that the ‘role of the media in keeping the Stephen Lawrence case in the spotlight showed that campaigning journalism can be a force for good’.

Only 6 per cent of people disagreed, while the rest were undecided.

Most people questioned in the survey believe that racism in Britain has fallen since Stephen’s murder but they recognise significant levels of prejudice remain.

The public also saluted the determination of the Lawrence family. An extraordinary 74 per cent believe their campaign for justice shows that ‘ordinary people who are determined can achieve real change and win justice’, with just  4 per cent disagreeing.

Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, said: ‘This poll shows that the public do believe that the campaign for justice made an important difference.

‘Hate crimes still happen, but the best way to honour this anniversary is to redouble our efforts to stamp out the prejudices that feed them.’

Labour MP David Lammy said: ‘It’s important to remember that those who killed Stephen didn’t represent Britain then, and racists in 2013 don’t represent Britain now. The country is a better place, but we shouldn’t pretend that the issue has gone away.’
