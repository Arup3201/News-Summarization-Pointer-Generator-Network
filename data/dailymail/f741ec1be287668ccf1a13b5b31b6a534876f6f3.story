The days of taking a day off work while you wait and wait for the delivery man to come may soon be over.

Amazon has launched a new service which allows you to collect your parcel from a nearby shop.

The online giant said it was helping customers to avoid the frustrations associated with waiting around for your package all day.

Instead, buyers can choose to have their parcel dropped off at one of nearly 5,000 newsagents across the UK.

The service is being offered in collaboration with existing company Collect Plus, which has been running the collect-at-shop option for various other brands for the last few years.

Amazon has been trialling the scheme with smaller items such as books for the last few months, and has now rolled it out nationwide.

Shoppers can also send items back to Amazon via their local newsagent, for instance for items such as clothing which do not fit well.

Collect Plus is available at Spar and CostCutters, alongside other smaller chains.

Mark 
Lewis, chief executive of CollectPlus, told The Register: 'By opting for a CollectPlus "pick up location" at checkout, 
Amazon.co.uk customers can choose to collect their items from one of our
 thousands of shops nationwide, at a time that suits them best.

'CollectPlus is already integrated into Amazon.co.uk Marketplace, so 
sellers can choose us as their delivery service.

'The extension of our 
service means that more people will be able to use CollectPlus, 
providing further choice and convenience for their deliveries.'

Amazon was founded in Seattle in 1994 as an online bookshop and quickly began to dominate the retail marketplace, becoming almost a poster-child for the rise of online shopping.
