On a mission: Ania Lisewska, 21, has reportedly vowed to bed 100,000 men across the globe

A Polish woman has reportedly vowed to travel to every city across the world in a bizarre quest to sleep with 100,000 men.

Ania Lisewska from Warsaw embarked on the unusual mission in her home city last month and has so far added 284 notches to her bedpost, according to the Huffington Post.

But while the 21-year-old's long term boyfriend is more forgiving than most - he hasn't dumped her after all - he's understandably 'not thrilled' by the idea.

Miss Lisewska said that he has 'had to come to terms with it'.

She told the Austrian Times: 'I want men from Poland, Europe and all around the world. I love sex, fun and men.

'In Poland the subject of sex is still taboo and anyone who wants to fulfill their sexual fantasies is considered a deviant, a w**** or mentally ill.'

Miss Lisewska says that she will only look to complete the task at the weekends and has set up a Facebook page and a website to chart her exploits - pages that her less than enamoured boyfriend might not want to save to his favourites.

She adds that she hopes to spend at least 20 minutes with each partner.

But the details of her apparently ambitious aim have cast doubt on its legitimacy, with several reports suggesting that it might be a hoax.

According to reports, having sex with that many people for 20 minutes at a time would take Miss Lisewska 3.8 years to complete if she didn't stop for food or sleep.

Seeing as she only plans to partake on Saturdays and Sundays, the task would take 20 years non-stop.

Assuming she lives to the age of 81, to hit 100,000 Miss Lisewska would have to up her quota to around 16 men on both days of the weekend.
