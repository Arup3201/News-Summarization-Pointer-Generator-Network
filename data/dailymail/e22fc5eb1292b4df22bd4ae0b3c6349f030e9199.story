Twenty-five luxury villas have been 'illegally' built by developers on the roof of a Chinese shopping mall.

The houses, covering an area about the 
size of three football pitches, were erected in 2009 on the roof of the 
multi-storey mall in Hengyang, the 
China Daily reported today.

But authorities say developers did not have the correct licence to build on such a bizarre location and have banned them from either knocking the villas down or selling them.

They are now home to migrant workers, some of whom helped build them originally.

Hengyang
 Wings Group ignored repeated warnings to demolish the houses and 
authorities have now ruled they cannot be sold.

The unusual designs feature bright blue roofs and pastel yellow walls and have wraparound verandas.

The picturesque homes are divided by white picket fences, while trees and bushes grow in their courtyards and along the pathways between them.

The houses were built without a licence, the report said, and although the city government repeatedly demanded their demolition, developer Hengyang Wings Group ignored the order.

Authorities in Hengyang, in the central province of Hunan, have prevented developers from selling the homes.

'The houses are now dormitories for our 
employees. Some migrant workers who took part in the villas' 
construction are also living in them,' Wang Jianxin, the developer's 
general manager, was quoted as telling a local newspaper.

Property investment has been a driver of the Chinese economy for years, although authorities have long sought to control rapid house price rises.

Land grabs have become a volatile social problem as officials and developers seek to cash in on the property boom, sometimes forcing people out of their homes without proper compensation.

With land disputes becoming more 
frequent, the government has forbidden housing demolitions without the 
owners' consent.

Police have been banned from intervening to 
protect developers in such rows, according to previous Chinese media 
reports.

New homes: Authorities say developers cannot sell the houses and they are now lived in by migrant workers

Last month Zheng Meiju hit the headlines after refusing to leave her flat in Rui'an, Zhejiang Province, in a protest about compensation.

Developers, who have demolished the remainder of the building, want to build a business plaza but she has continued to live in the house despite having no running water or electricity.

In May it emerged that developers in Yangji, Guangdong province, used bulldozers to divert a local river to encircle defiant homeowners holding out for better financial compensation.

Residents said electricity and fresh water had been cut off and local authorities were forced to step in to negotiate between the two sides.
