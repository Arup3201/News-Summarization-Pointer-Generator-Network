Celebrity chef Raymond Blanc has criticised the organic food movement for being 'too elitist and expensive' while praising McDonalds for the quality of its ingredients.

The chef, who runs the Le Manior Aux Quat'Saisons restaurant in Oxfordshire with two Michelin stars, said the trend for eating food free of chemicals has now become the preserve of the well-off.

His comments come after previously backing the organic cause.

But now Mr Blanc has changed his mind as people are being priced out of buying organic produce.

He told the Times: 'It has shot itself in the foot by creating a movement that has become elitist by being so expensive.'

He also added that he was surprised to learn that fast food chain McDonalds has such high standards for its ingredients after presenting the UK chief executive with an honour at the the Sustainable Restaurant Awards.

Mr Blanc had previously said in 2006 that the chain represented all the values he strongly rejected.

But he explained: 'I was amazed. All their eggs are free range; all their pork is free range; all their beef is free range.

'They're supporting thousands of British farms and saving energy and waste by doing so.'

Mr
 Blanc's thoughts on organic food come after the government warned 
families not to waste their money on such produce because they think it 
is healthier.

A recent study in the British Journal of Nutrition found organic crops have up to 60 per cent more antioxidants than non-organic crops.

But critics claim there is still no evidence that organic is a healthier option.

And earlier this month, amid growing concern that too few people are eating enough fruit and vegetables, the government stressed that families feeling the pinch should not waste their money on organic.

Government frontbencher Baroness Jolly said: ‘It can be difficult balancing a family budget, but in providing a varied, balanced diet nobody need feel they have given their family a nutritionally inferior diet by choosing lower-priced, conventional products.’
