Wowed the audience: The pair are so good that they even triumphed in the under 14 class despite there lack of years

Glenn and Kayleigh have only been dancing together since February and are thrilled with the results of the competition held at Disneyland Paris.

Their success is down to rigorous training sessions three times a week, held at the dance studio owned by Glenn’s family in Bournemouth, Dorset.

Influence: Popular TV show Strictly Come Dancing had them rushing to the dance floor

As his friends started attending Glenn decided to take up the hobby, which quickly grew in popularity with his age group as Strictly Come Dancing aired on TV.

Dad Warren, 32, said: “Glenn took part in his first world championship when he was seven and actually came last, but over the years he has won many times.

'He has now got 11 world championship titles, five of which he won with Kayleigh, four he won last year, and two when he was aged nine.

Practice makes perfect: The schoolchildren train hard after school to perfect their skills

Team work: Kayleigh has been dancing since she was just two-years-old and tried a variety of styles including ballet and disco before settling on ballroom and pairing up with Glenn

'He has so much enthusiasm and is always dancing, he was definitely inspired by Strictly Come Dancing but also the whole environment of it growing up.

'At the competition last week they won against couples from countries including Poland, Israel, America, Italy and China which is brilliant.

'He has only been dancing with Kayleigh since February and she has done very well.'

Proud: The children's parents are incredibly proud of their achievements

Runs in the family: Glenn's grandparents Glenn and Lynette Boyce won the world title in 1975
