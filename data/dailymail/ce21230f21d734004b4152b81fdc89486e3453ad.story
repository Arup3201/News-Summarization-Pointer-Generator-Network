A man who burgled a children's hospital unit after drinking heavily handed himself in to police after having flashbacks of committing the crime.

Kieron Hampson, 23, broke into the unit which is used by children with special needs after discharging himself from hospital where he was being treated after falling down stairs.

Hampson, from Blackpool, Lancashire, turned himself in after remembering breaking into Blenheim House on Newton Drive, Preston Crown Court heard

Hampson recalled breaking into Blenheim House Children's Hospital on Newton Drive after discharging himself from hospital following a night of heavy drinking

The 23-year-old had been drinking heavily before being admitted to the hospital after falling down a flight of stairs following a row with his mother in June.

Hampson discharged himself at around 4am and broke into the children's unit at around 6.30am on the same day.

Prosecuting Karen Brooks said two computer towers were missing from the clinic and a confidential waste paper sack had been emptied out on to the floor.

The court heard it cost around £400 for repairs to glass in two doors and the computer towers were found a few hundred metres away by a member of the public.

After admitting having flashbacks of the incident to police, Hampson's DNA was found in blood discovered at the scene.

The 23-year-old admitted burglary and possession of a bladed article before expressing remorse for his actions.

His legal representative told the court how he had a long history of alcoholism.

Judge Anthony Russell QC sentenced him to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years, with two years supervision.

He was also handed an alcohol treatment programme and a three-month curfew, to run from 8pm to 8am.

Hampson was told by Judge Russel: 'You will decide whether you serve this prison sentence or not.

'You will have to make sure you do not commit any further offences'.

He must also pay a £100 statutory surcharge.
