Daddy's little girl: Paetongtarn Shinawatra is the youngest daughter of ousted Thai prime minister and former Manchester City owner Thaksin Shinawatra. Here they pose at her graduation day at a Bangkok university in 2008

A Cathay Pacific flight attendant has quit after threatening to throw coffee in the face of the youngest daughter of Thailand's ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra during a flight.

The attendant, known only by her Facebook moniker Honey Lochanachai, was serving on a on November 25 flight from Bangkok to Hong Kong when she realised Paetongtarn Shinawatra was a passenger.

She claimed she told her cabin manager that she could not serve 'the daughter of [her] enemy' but was told to carry out her duties.

Mr Thaksin, the millionaire former 
owner of Manchester City FC, is a divisive figure in Thai politics who 
lives in self-imposed exile after he was overthrown in a military coup 
in 2006. His sister, Yingluck, is the current prime minister.

Following her encounter with Miss Shinawatra, the hostess posted a series of hostile messages on Facebook, including a picture of Ms Paetongtarn's seating number.

Then she wrote: 'Paetongtarn, I didn't throw coffee in
her face today but she had no clue that I will keep on fighting until 
your clan can no longer live like fleas on the Thai soil.'

The Hong Kong-based airline said on its Thailand Facebook page that the stewardess was 'no longer an employee'.

It did not release the name of the attendant, but she said on Facebook that she resigned to take responsibility.

Describing the incident on the social networking site, Miss Lochanachai wrote: 'I immediately told my flight manager
I could not work knowing the daughter of my enemy was on the plane.

Happy family: Thaksin Shinawatra looks on with two of daughters Pintongtha, left, and Peathongtarn, centre, prior to the Barclays Premiership match between West Ham United and Manchester City, which he then owned, in 2007

'Sworn enemy': Thaksin Shinawatra, the 
millionaire former owner of Manchester City FC, is a divisive figure in 
Thai politics who lives in self-imposed exile. Right, he shakes hands 
with former British PM Tony Blair in 2005

'I called my personal adviser asking 
if it would be all right to throw coffee at Paetongtarn, but was told 
that this could breach Hong Kong's laws.'

'I discussed with another Thai 
colleague who didn't like them about going over to ridicule her dad 
before she steps out of the plane.'

In a passage written in the 'favorite
quote' section of her Facebook page, she says: 'While it is clear that 
physically, we belong to the animal family, it is our behaviour that 
define our humanity, not the fact that we stand upright or have more 
developed brains.'

On the page, she also makes reference to 'yellow patriotism' - originally a coalition of protesters against Thaksin Shinawatra responsible for various political uprisings in recent years.

The pro-monarchy 'Yellow Shirts', officially known as the People's Alliance for Democracy, formed in 2005 to bring down the Thaksin government, blaming him for him for failing to protect Thai companies adversely affected by the 1997-1998 Asian economic crisis.

'Yellow Shirt' protests in 2005 helped to generate the atmosphere of political crisis that enabled the military to oust Thaksin and were again instrumental in the judicial coup that 
resulted in the installation of the Democrat Party-led coalition 
government in late 2008.

Bad news: The news emerged on the same day Cathay Pacific¿s flight attendants union, which represents more than 5,800 airline cabin crew members, threatened industrial action if the carrier doesn¿t agree to hold wage talks by 3pm today

In 2009, PAD's leader Sondhi Limthongkul survived an assassination attempt in which gunmen ambushed his car at a petrol station, shooting its wheels and spraying it with over 100 AK-47 bullets. He was shot in the head but survived.

A Cathay spokeswoman said the airline is investigating the incident, adding: 'Cathay Pacific regrets this unfortunate incident and wishes to assure all of our customers that their privacy - and strict adherence to all privacy regulations - is extremely important to us.'

The news emerged on the same day Cathay Pacific’s flight attendants union, which represents more than 5,800 airline cabin crew members, threatened industrial action if the carrier doesn’t agree to hold wage talks by 3 pm today.

More than 100 flight attendants staged a rally at Hong Kong’s airport yesterday after the company said last week it will raise salaries by about 2 percent next year, less than the 5 percent sought by the workers’ union.
