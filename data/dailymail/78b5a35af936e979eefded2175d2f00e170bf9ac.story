Defence bosses were last night embroiled in a censorship row over a British soldier’s highly critical book about the war in Afghanistan.

The MoD was accused of being paranoid as it made a last-ditch attempt to block publication of a damning study of Britain’s military campaign in Helmand.

The 13-year conflict has cost 448 British lives – most of them after Tony Blair ordered troops into the volatile Taliban stronghold in May 2006.

MoD chiefs actually commissioned 
Oxford-educated Territorial Army captain Dr Mike Martin to write about 
the mission as part of his PhD.

But
 his criticism of intelligence blunders and the failure of commanders to
 understand the conflict is said to have embarrassed officials.

Now
 the MoD has asked for the damning account to be pulped, claiming it 
breaches the Official Secrets Act and uses classified material uncovered
 by Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, which Dr Martin and his publisher 
deny.

As a result, the 31-year-old author has quit the military in disgust after serving for ten years.

Dr Martin interviewed 150 people for his book using fluent Pushtun, the local dialect in the Helmand Province

He
 is now pushing ahead with the publication this month of An Intimate 
War: An Oral History Of The Helmand Conflict 1978-2012. He spent six 
years researching conflict in the province, starting with the Russian 
involvement in the Seventies.

The
 row will fuel speculation that Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is 
paranoid about criticism of the MoD. But the book has been praised by 
senior military figures and MPs.

Major
 General Andrew Kennett, who commanded Dr Martin’s unit, said: ‘I think 
he has done the Army a great service by writing this.’

Labour
 defence spokesman Kevan Jones said: ‘Clearly Philip Hammond’s culture 
of paranoia extends to trying to ban books, which is extraordinary.’

Dr Martin (pictured above) explained to the Ministry of Defence that material contained within the book was already in the public domain

General
 Sir David Richards, the recently retired head of the Armed Forces, who 
commanded international forces in Afghanistan between 2006-07, said the 
book was ‘quite simply, the book on Helmand’, adding: ‘I sincerely wish 
it had been available to me when I was ISAF Commander in Afghanistan.’ 
Dr Martin said: ‘I have been forced to resign. I was employed as a 
constructive critic and I strongly believe that the Army needs reform.’

His
 MoD-funded doctorate was awarded in February 2013 and he told officials
 he planned to turn it into a book, with proceeds going to military 
charities.

But the MoD sat on the manuscript for 14 months, only raising its complaints in February.

Dr
 Martin said he sent the PhD to the Army and the MoD before it was even 
awarded, adding: ‘I told them that I was going to be converting this 
into a book. There’s no difference in the content, just the style.

Dr Martin claimed that military commanders failed to understand that the Afghan conflict was primarily a tribal civil war

‘I
 heard nothing until February when they said, “You can’t run it”. So I 
resigned my commission and we have restarted the print run.’

Dr Martin, from East London, accused MoD officials of trying to protect the reputation of Britain and its US allies.

His
 book argues that Nato’s ISAF troops failed to understand they were 
getting involved in a tribal civil war, rather than a fight against the 
Taliban.

He said: ‘We often 
made the conflict worse, rather than better. This was usually as a 
result of the Helmandis manipulating our ignorance.’

Dr
 Martin, who conducted 150 interviews in Pashtu, the local language he 
speaks fluently, said: ‘The book demonstrates how outsiders have most 
often misunderstood the struggle in Helmand and how, in doing so, they 
have exacerbated the conflict and made it more violent.’

He and publisher Hurst denied including classified intelligence material in the book.

Repeated written requests for clarification on national security breaches were ignored by the MoD, they said.

Hurst
 managing director Michael Dwyer said: ‘I don’t know why the MoD opposed
 it. They said it was something to do with Wikileaks and classified 
material so we stopped the print run but when we asked them to elaborate
 they refused. I think they’re just embarrassed.’

Yesterday the MoD denied claims it had tried to block the book using the Official Secrets Act.

A statement on the MoD's website said the Army accepted classified documents referred to in the book were from public sources so the final decision not to approve publication was not based on the act.

It said: 'The MoD is not in any way attempting to prevent the book's publication.

'The Army simply decided that it was inappropriate for a serving officer to publish a book that is so heavily critical of the Army, the MoD and our allies.

'The existing policy on publication of books and articles by serving military personnel is clear and exists to ensure that our operational security and the personal security of our people is protected. It is also designed to protect the hard won reputation of the Armed Forces.'

A number of books critical of the campaign have faced MoD censorship. An entire print run of Dead Men Risen, an account of the deployment of the Welsh Guards to Helmand in 2009, was pulped on the ground of national security. The MoD eventually erased 50 words from the manuscript.

In November, Defence Secretary Mr Hammond was branded 'paranoid' over claims he banned his Labour opposite number from sitting next to one of Britain’s top military chiefs at a dinner.

He was accused of ensuring that organisers of an Armed Forces charity dinner tore up their seating plan to separate Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker from Sir Stuart Peach, the Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff. His aides denied Labour's claim.

But he has also been criticised for blocking off-the-record briefings from senior military officers to MPs.

An MoD spokesman said: 'The MoD has a strong record of learning from previous campaigns and encourages its officers to challenge existing norms and conventional wisdom.

'However the publication of books and articles by serving military personnel is governed by well-established policy and regulations. When these are breached the MoD will withhold approval.'

Former TA captain Dr Mike Martin’s book says Britain failed in Helmand because political and military leaders ‘mischaracterised’ the conflict.

His work argues that the Taliban were not the ‘main drivers of violence’.

Instead, conflict was driven by Helmandi individuals, including local politicians  and tribal chiefs, and their personal motivations.

It is therefore more of a civil war  between clans than a clash between the ‘good’ government of Afghanistan and the ‘bad’ Taliban.

In one example, he says that in 2008, the district governor of Nad-e Ali asked British officers to drive the Taliban from the village of Shin Kalay.

The village elders appeared pleased, and drank tea with the soldiers.

Publisher Michael Dwyer said he intends launching the book as planned despite the objections of the Ministry of Defence

But the  so-called Taliban were a tribal militia  raised by the elders to keep out the district police, who had been raping young boys and stealing.

Unfortunately, the British had entered the village with 20 Afghan policemen. It later emerged that the district governor was from the same tribe as the police and a different one to the village elders.

Furthermore, the villagers had evicted the district governor in the 1980s when he had then been the chief of police under the communists.

Dr Martin said: ‘The British had a very simplistic understanding of the conflict – an understanding that did not chime with how the Helmandis themselves saw the conflict. The insurgency narrative ... meant we often made the conflict worse, rather  than better.’

Dr Martin insists it is vital to learn lessons from the war, launched in 2001 to topple the Taliban, as Britain prepares to end its involvement at the end of the year.

Critics have accused Nato of becoming bogged down in Afghanistan because Western leaders had only a ‘primitive understanding’ of its population, tribal culture and geography.

Both General Sir Nick Houghton, the Chief of the Defence Staff, and his recently-retired predecessor General Sir David Richards have flagged up British failures when troops were sent to Helmand in May 2006.
