Labour last night became embroiled in a major row with its biggest union donor after the woman at the centre of a vote-rigging scandal was blocked from standing in a key marginal seat.

Senior figures in Unite threatened to retaliate only weeks before the general election after Karie Murphy, a close friend of the union’s leader, Len McCluskey, was excluded from a list of candidates in Halifax.

Miss Murphy was suspended by Labour in 2013 and reported to police after allegations that the union had tried to manipulate the selection process in Falkirk in her favour.

She was later cleared and had her membership reinstated, but she quit as Labour candidate in the Scottish seat for the sake of ‘reconciliation and unity’. Unite was accused of recruiting members to ‘pack’ the local party before the selection vote. It has always denied any wrongdoing.

Unite had hoped to use its power within the party to parachute Miss Murphy in as the candidate in Halifax, where the current Labour MP, Linda Riordan, has announced that she is stepping down.

But yesterday it was revealed that a selection panel, made up of three members of Labour’s National Executive Committee and led by the party’s deputy leader Harriet Harman, had not included Miss Murphy on a six-strong ‘long list’ to be the candidate in the West Yorkshire seat.

The dispute risks reopening the wounds of the bitter Falkirk row. 

Ed Miliband had been warned that his party risked losing the seat if Miss Murphy was selected, but the union could now stop bankrolling the party’s election campaign.

Following the decision, a Unite source warned that Miss Harman will ‘have to answer for her actions in due course’. A union spokesman refused to comment on what sanctions it could take.

Unite has given Labour more than £14million since Mr Miliband became Labour leader. Nearly 130 of the candidates picked to stand for the party in May have links to the union.

Mrs Riordan, a Unite member, yesterday accused the party of ‘underhand and anti-democratic manipulation’ of the selection.

It is understood figures in the party had been frantically working behind the scenes to try to stop Miss Murphy.

Tony Blair helped broker a secret £1million donation in a bid to weaken union influence, it was reported at the weekend.

At a dinner at the former prime minister’s home last week, Assem Allam, chairman of Hull City football club, promised £500,000 in extra funding if Unite withholds money because of the selection row.

Mrs Riordan, a member of the Socialist Campaign Group in Parliament, has a majority of only 1,472 in Halifax, which is number 18 on the Tories’ target list.

A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Labour has a well-established process for selections. The NEC will decide on the shortlist for Halifax and will assess the suitability of the candidates, the wishes of the local party and the best interests of the party.’
