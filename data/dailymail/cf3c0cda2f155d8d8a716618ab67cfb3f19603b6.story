A creative photographer has taken 365 pictures charting the adventures of a Legographer- a Lego character who likes to 'take' pictures.

The quirky series of shots follows the fantasy life of Leg O'Grapher, a Lego character who has travelled across the UK taking pictures, ahead of the release of the Lego movie.

Andrew Whyte, 39, from Southsea, Portsmouth carries the Lego man in his pocket where ever he goes, just in case the perfect picture opportunity arises.

He said: 'I started the project because I am a really compulsive photographer and I feel like I have to take pictures at the time.

'I am used to taking pictures but not showing them to people so by introducing the Lego character into a scene it takes a on a whole new meaning as I am telling the story of the character.'

The Legographer was photographed on his travels by Mr Whyte. Here he stops to capture a snap of an old routemaster bus in London

Tourist: The Lego man joins thousands of visitors to London by snapping a quick picture of one of the capital's famous red phone boxes

Going underground: Leg will have to be careful to avoid getting caught underfoot while he takes some shots of one of the world's busiest train networks

On the river: Leg goes for a stroll down the Thames in London, before stopping to take a picture of the Millennium Eye

Home sweet home: Here the Lego man, nicknamed Leg OGrapher, takes a picture of Portsmouth harbor, where Mr Whyte lives

Braving the weather: Never one to miss out on an opportunity, Mr Whyte even braved the recent bad weather to take the Lego man out and caputre some shots

Happy couple: With a quick change of shirt, the Lego man is off to ply his trade at a wedding by snapping a quick shot of the bride and groom

This is how we do it: Behind the scenes Mr Whyte sets up the wedding shot with help from the couple's son

By the seaside: Leg takes a moment to line up a shot of Brighton's famous pier set against a stunning sunset

Life's a beach: Perhaps it's the fact that he's from Portsmouth, but Leg seems to have a preference for the sea. Here he captures the fun at Southsea

Man of action: Of course working so close to nature has its unintended consequences, including the occasional crab-attack

Ready for a close-up: After an exciting day at the beach, Andrew Whyte places Leg back on the sand to capture a shot as the sun goes down

Sea legs: Mr Whyte caputes an image of HMS Warrior in Portsmouth harbor, while his trusty Lego companion does the same

Iconic: Of course no British seaside scene would be complete without an ice cream van, although judging by Leg's woolen hat they won't be doing much business

Blowing a gale: Leg lines up a picture of a tree which appears to have suffered the wrath of the recent stormy weather and has ended up bent out of shape

Dedicated: A different view of the bendy-tree picture shows the lengths Mr Whyte is willing to go to in order to get the perfect angle

Urban: Leg the photographer shows off his range by swapping from natural scenes to a city environment, snapping a picture of this car park

Futuristic: Leg waits for the cover of darkness before trying his hand a light painting, a photographic technique where a camera lens is left open while a light source is moved around, creating patterns

Holidays are coming: In another impressive light display, Leg is pictured in front of one of the famous Coca Cola Christmas trucks

Night vision: Mr Whyte is a professional photographer who specialises in night-time shots, such as this one of the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth

Sparks: Leg will need more than just a glove to make sure his arm doesn't melt off while playing with this bonfire-night sparkler

Perspective: Mr Whyte says the project has interested him because it allows him to take a different viewpoint on everyday objects - like these Skittles

Inspiration: Leg OGrapher meets celebrity photographer Perou at the Focus on Imaging show

Night lights: Mr Whyte uses his expert knowledge of lighting to capture these two end-of-day scenes, one using artificial light, the other using natural

Centre stage: Andrew Whyte uses a fish-eye lens to capture the whole of the Kings Theatre in Southsea, along with his Lego companion

Close encounters of the furred kind: Leg also explores the countryside, taking a picture of this mouse (right) and getting trapped in a log (left)

Taking a bumble: Leg cautiously approaches this rather dead-looking bumble bee while Mr Whyte takes a snap

That's got to hurt: Life is tricky when you're only half an inch high, as Leg demonstrates here by getting hit in the face with a Frisbee

Taking a trip: While roaming the streets looking for another photo opportunity, Leg trips up on this drain which as been left open

The adventure continues: With his trusty camera in hand, Leg OGrapher is always ready to capture more amazing pictures from his own unique point of view
