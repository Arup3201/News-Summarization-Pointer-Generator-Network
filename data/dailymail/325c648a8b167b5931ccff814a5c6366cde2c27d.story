While England kept up their 100 per cent in Group E with a convincing 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley, the chasing duo of Slovenia and Switzerland kept up the pressure.

Goals from Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, an own goal and debutant Harry Kane made it a comfortable night for Roy Hodgson's side as they edged towards qualification. 

Slovenia stay in second after thrashing Group E whipping boys San Marino 6-0 at home, with five of their goals coming in the final 45 minutes and all being scored by different players.

Fiorentina midfielder Josip Ilicic opened the scoring on 10 minutes but the Slovenians couldn't add to their tally before the break.

Borussia Dortmund star Kevin Kampl fired home just after half-time and the floodgates open with goals from Andraz Struna, Milivoje Novakovic, Dejan Lazarevic and Branko Ilic settling the tie. 

Switzerland are also still in the hunt for a top two finish and dispatched a tricky Estonia side to keep themselves very much in the chase.

Highly-coveted Basle defender Fabian Schar scored the first goal after 17 minutes before Granit Xhaka doubled the advantage just ten minutes later.

Haris Seferovic put the icing on the cake on 80 minutes when he fired home the third to keep the Swiss level on points with Slovenia.
