Hankering after a gourmet meal but can't be bothered to leave the comfort of your own home? 

A new online marketplace  has the solution, connecting professional chefs with home kitchens.

And while the concept of having a top chef cook a meal in the comfort of home might not be something new, the practice has become more common thanks to the power the internet.

Chef Enrico Lionti signed up with La Belle Assiette after deciding to leave restaurant kitchens

Enrico Lionti, a chef living in Paris, decided to leave restaurant kitchens and instead cook at people's homes.

He signed up to an online home-cooking website service, La Belle Assiette, which connects independent chefs with clients.

Chefs are thoroughly tested by La Belle Assiette to ensure their skills are up to scratch before they work with clients

Mr Lionti says the concept allows him to make his own decisions, pick the menus, work when he wants to, and concentrate on what he does best: cooking.

'In fact the concept of home chef wasn't new for me, I knew about the concept, but I didn't want to launch myself into this adventure on my own,' he says in a video.

'So I chose 'La Belle Assiette.'

For £35, chefs at La Belle Assiette will shop for ingredients, cook meals, serve guests and clear up 

He now works several nights a week across the capital and is quite happy about his situation.

With over 400 chefs for clients to choose from, the founders of 'La Belle Assiette' have devised a way to make life easy for both the chefs and the clients.

'La Belle Assiette looks after all the business side, so we look after customer service, booking, billing, all the logistics of looking after the chef on the business side so the chef can just focus on cooking and being with the client,' said co-founder Stephen Leguillon.

The website, which takes a percentage of the chef's fee in exchange for its services, is available in the UK, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Luxembourg.

It promises to help clients 'rediscover the pleasure of entertaining at home'.

Mr Leguillon has high hopes for the service and plans to expand into new countries.

Starting from €45 (£35) per person, Lionti will cook up a feast without the client having to lift a finger.  

For that price, he will provide the ingredients, cook and serve guests.

Audrey Stora, who hired Mr Lionti, said: 'The chef has prepared everything. He started with a surprise amuse-bouche, we are now eating the foie gras. 

'It's super, it tastes really nice, it's really pleasant to be served at home [and be] relaxed with my friends. It's very comfortable'

The icing on the cake? The chef cleans up and leaves his clients with a spotless kitchen.
