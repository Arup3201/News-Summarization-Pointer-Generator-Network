The new boss of Network Rail was appointed yesterday – on a salary £84,000 higher than his predecessor.

As passengers face crippling fare rises, Mark Carne will be paid £675,000 a year, with the potential for bonuses to push his annual earnings over £1million.

The former Shell oil executive will take over from Sir David Higgins, 51, who earns a salary of £591,000.

Furious unions said the enormous rise
was ‘an extraordinary decision’ and ‘an insult to passengers’ suffering
expensive, delayed and overcrowded services, urging Network Rail to get
off the ‘gravy train’.

Mr Carne, 54, will take over the role
of chief executive on April 1 but joins Network Rail in January – just 
as rail travellers face another round of inflation-busting fare hikes.

The rail network operator has come 
under constant criticism recently over train punctuality and received 
repeated warnings from rail regulators about its poor performance, 
particularly on long-distance routes.

Justifying the bumper pay package, 
Network Rail said: ‘Mr Carne’s base salary of £675,000 was determined 
following an exhaustive and independent process which compared the 
salaries of chief executives in both the public and private sectors 
given Network Rail’s unique position as a not-for-dividend, independent 
company.

‘The review concluded that the  
proposed salary reflected that unique status placing, as it does, the 
chief executive’s salary at a point between the two sectors.

‘Mr Carne will not take any potential annual incentive payment  for 2013/14.’

But Manuel Cortes, of the TSSA 
transport workers’ union, said Mr Carne’s salary was ‘an insult to rail 
passengers who have seen price rises of 20 per cent since May 2010’.

Mr Cortes added that Mr Carne also 
stood to earn large bonuses of up to 60 per cent a year on top of his 
salary, plus a 100 per cent ‘long term incentive’ bonus over his first 
three years.

Mr Cortes said: ‘It is passengers who
should be rewarded with lower fares, not directors for joining a gravy 
train paid for by every taxpayer.’

Mick Whelan, of train drivers’ union 
Aslef, said: ‘The extraordinary decision to hire a new man, Mark Carne, 
to do the same job as Sir David, but to pay him a whopping £80,000 more 
exposes the extraordinary lack of governance and lack of proper public 
scrutiny in Network Rail.’

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is now quite  clear that high pay does not buy  high performance.’

Mr Carne, a father of three, was 
formerly executive vice president for the Middle East and North Africa 
for Royal Dutch Shell. He also worked for natural gas company BG Group.

Nearly one train in 20 was 
cancelled or more than 30 minutes late on a major rail line this spring.
Passengers on the East Coast line, which runs from London to Scotland, 
had to contend with more cancellations and delays between April and June
than those on any other line, according to the Office of Rail 
Regulation.
