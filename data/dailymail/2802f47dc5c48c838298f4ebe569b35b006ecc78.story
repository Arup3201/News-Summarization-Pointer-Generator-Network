She won't be the only one feeling the pain after a night of Christmas excess.

But Bella the German Shepherd may think twice before lapping up a litre bottle of advocaat again - as the drunken dog ended up needing emergency treatment at an animal hospital.

The mischievous puppy managed to knock the 17.2 per cent bottle of liqueur off a table when her owner was out - and when the glass smashed she thirstily licked up the sweet-tasting alcohol.

'Boozy Bella': Bella the German Shepherd required emergency treatment after knocking a litre bottle of advocaat off a table when her owner was out - and lapping up the contents

Her shocked owner Rachel Day returned to her home in Shepherds Bush, London, to find Bella looking worse for wear, bumping into walls and struggling to walk.

After finding the broken bottle, which costs £11, the mother-of-four put two and two together.

Seventh-month-old Bella was rushed to the Blue Cross animal hospital in Victoria, Central London where vets put her on a drip to try to flush the alcohol out of her system.

She was kept in overnight to sleep off her heavy drinking session and was allowed to go home the next morning after making a full recovery.

Yesterday Ms Day said: 'I had only gone out for an hour and a half, and when I got back I found the smashed bottle.

'It was a Warninks-brand advocaat and we were very much looking forward to drinking it over Christmas.

'I had to mop up some of the liquid but most of it had gone.

'It wasn't until a few minutes later when I saw Bella attempting and failing to walk properly that I put two and two together.

'She had been sleeping, but then she tried to get up and just started banging into walls. She looked like a drunk person.

'There was lager and coca-cola on the table outside too, but she obviously knew what she preferred.

'I think she just wanted to enter into the festive spirit but she evidently didn't know her limits.

'I had got home at about 4pm, and we were at the vets within the hour and thankfully we were able to deal with it in time.

Her owner Rachel Day said: 'I think she probably just felt a bit left out because she hadn't got her own Christmas drink, but I will have to make sure I keep the bottles completely out of reach in future'

'They flushed her out and put her on a drip.

'She's a big dog though. When I went to collect her the next morning she was as chirpy as always, she didn't have a hangover at all.

'She's such a wonderful character. The vets fell in love with her as well - they nicknamed her 'Boozy Bella'.

'It was really scary at the time when we weren't even sure if she would pull through, but we can laugh about it now.

'I think she probably just felt a bit left out because she hadn't got her own Christmas drink, but I will have to make sure I keep the bottles completely out of reach in future.'

Charlotte Hamilton, a Blue Cross Vet, said: 'It is lucky Bella's owners came home and discovered what Bella had done so quickly, as alcohol is toxic to pets.

'Because Bella is almost fully grown and quite a big dog the damage is not as bad as it may have been with a smaller breed, which could have proved fatal.

'Be careful with storing and keeping alcohol over the Christmas period as pets may like the taste of sweet drinks like advocaat and might not be as lucky as Bella.'
