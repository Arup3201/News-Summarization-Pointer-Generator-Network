Will England qualify for the knockout stages?

Italy recorded an astonishing 93.2 per cent passing accuracy during their 2-1 win against England on Saturday night which is the highest ever recorded in a single World Cup game since 1966.

With players like Andrea Pirlo, Marco Verratti and Daniele De Rossi patrolling midfield in the heat of Arena Amazonia, it's no wonder Italy recorded such a high figure.

Italian maestro Pirlo showed his class once again, making 108 passes and only misplacing five of those while his partner Daniele de Rossi made 99 of his 105.

This, when compared with the 62 passes made by England captain Steven Gerrard gives an insight into how difficult the Three Lions found it to make an impact in Manaus.

England's midfield looked overrun at times as Jordan Henderson and Steven Gerrard battled to interrupt the Azzurri's flowing football.

Italy's opening goal may have indirectly arrived from a corner, but even that involved several intricate passes and a sumptuous dummy from Pirlo before Claudio Marchisio rifled home in the 35th minute.

Overall Cesare Prandelli's side made 561 passes from 602 attempts as they quite literally passed England's spirited performance into the ground.

It's no wonder that it was the England players slumping to the ground, complaining of cramp and picking up slight injuries towards the end of the game as chasing shadows in the South American evening heat started to catch up with Roy Hodgson players.

As the English players tired, Italy's substitutions came on and fitted seemlessly into their team's passing game.

Paris Saint Germain midfielder Verratti spent an hour finding space and nipping between the lines while recording 93.90 per cent before his replacement Thiago Motta came on and failed to misplace a pass for the final 30 minutes.

England tired and began to lose possession far too easily in the closing stages, Wayne Rooney shooting wildly and Raheem Sterling hitting crosses into the crowd.

The Italians on the other hand looked so assured with the ball at their feet that after Mario Balotelli headed past Joe Hart in the 48th minute, only one team looked as though they could pick up all three points.        

For all the energy that the England youngster possess, the likes of Sterling and Henderson will have learned a huge lesson in the importance of being patient on the ball thanks to the Azzurri.
