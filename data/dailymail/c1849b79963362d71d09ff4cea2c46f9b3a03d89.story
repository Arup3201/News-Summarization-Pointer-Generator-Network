It appears Santa's little helper went overboard with the celebrations on Christmas Day.

To get through working on one of the merriest days of the year, police on duty today have taken to social media to share a bit of festive cheer and a timely message for all.

It all started with an anonymous tip from a man - who only wanted to be known as 'Mr S' - which led to the arrest of an elf for drink driving.

Police made no exceptions and caught the wayward elf in Scone - in the Hunter Region which is north of Sydney - and breathalysed him, where he blew mid-range.

Police on duty during Christmas Day took to social media to share a bit of festive cheer and a timely message for all: 'drink driving...it's a crime'

Several images of the elf, who has not been named, were posted on Hunter Valley local area command's Facebook page on Christmas morning.

It was a parody with a serious road safety reminder for Aussie motorists.

'He [the elf] has had his free phone call and is now waiting in the dock to be charged,' police wrote on Facebook.

'Has been photographed. Currently being fingerprinted. Drink driving...it's a crime.'

The elf, who's sure to be on the 'naughty' list next year,  signed his licence suspension notice and was granted conditional bail.

Police wrote that the elf is expected to appear at the Scone Local Court on January 22, 2015.

Senior Constable Jason Lambert says in reality, mid-range drink driving can result in suspension of licence on the spot and a hefty fine - clearly not an ideal way to spend  Christmas.

'The Facebook posts were all a bit of fun but is also a way for us to get the message across especially at this time of year,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

And it wasn't just NSW Police who had a bit of a laugh on social media.

Australian police across the state took to Twitter on Christmas Day, being prompted by Queensland officers who asked: 'Hey @nswpolice @VictoriaPolice @SAPoliceNews @TasmaniaPolice, have you guys seen Santa yet?'

In response to the question, NSW Police wrote: 'Left cookies + milk (full cream, skim & soy - we never know his tastes these days).'

'We have made sure cookies are gluten free & our reindeer food organic,' Victoria Police also tweeted.
