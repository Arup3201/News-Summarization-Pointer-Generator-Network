The schools are going back, you’ve just returned from your holiday... so, naturally, we’re heading for a mini-heatwave.

After a distinctly dismal end to August, the arrival of September is going to be one for the sunseekers – so don’t dig your winter coat out just yet.

Forecasters confirmed yesterday that temperatures in some parts of the country could rise to the mid-20s centigrade next week, thanks to the effects of Hurricane Cristobal.

While the north-west extremes of Britain may be side-swiped by the remains of the storm that blasted the Bahamas earlier this week, the effect is that the rest of the country will benefit from Cristobal dragging in hot air from the continent.

But before the barbecue weather emerges on Monday, the wind and scattered showers are expected to last the weekend.

Northern and western parts will continue to be windy after gales battered the region yesterday – with some places in the highlands of Scotland seeing gusts of 59mph.

However, the Met Office said it will start to feel warmer from tomorrow, with temperatures creeping above average for September.

A spokesman predicted it will then get warmer still next week, with the high pressure responsible for the Indian summer potentially holding out for an entire fortnight.

She said: ‘We could see temperatures hit 22C (72F) to 24C (75F) at Heathrow on Sunday with highs in the 20s across the south and late teens in the north.

‘Wednesday will be very warm in the south, we are looking at up to 25C (77F) – but there might be some thundery outbreaks on Thursday.’

But she added that the forecast remained optimistic: ‘Certainly until Friday and Saturday most places will stay dry and sunny with good temperatures, and after that it depends on what happens with the high pressure.

‘There is an indication it could build again the week after, meaning two weeks of settled weather.’ Temperatures in the south are expected to hit the mid-20s (79F) by the end of the week and reaching 20C (68F) elsewhere.

With building humidity it could feel close to 30C (86F) in some regions with even the far north getting close to 26C (79F).

Veteran BBC forecaster Michael Fish said ‘there’s another helping of summer on the way next week’, while Leon Brown, a forecaster for The Weather Channel UK, predicted that Cristobal will ‘shut the door’ on any cold weather setting in at the beginning of September.

He said: ‘Cristobal will track over the North Atlantic as a very deep depression this weekend, but will be well to the north of the UK and move across Iceland.

‘The system will effectively shut the door on any cooler Arctic flows for early September and initiate ridging and high pressure over the UK.

‘With a southerly flow developing later next week we may see some very warm temperatures, perhaps 25C (77F) to 26C (79F) in the south by next Thursday and Friday.’

And although this year’s summer may have felt sweltering, the Met Office said it is not likely to break any records. Early figures have shown the UK’s mean temperature for the season will be around 14.8C (59F) – just 0.5C above average.

It said the cooler August offset the warmer June and July.

This month has also been wetter than average, but not by much – the country has actually seen normal rainfall, with 246.7mm (9.7inches) falling across the UK.
