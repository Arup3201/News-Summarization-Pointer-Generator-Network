A former college football star who stopped playing after suffering four concussions has been found dead at an off-campus apartment.

University of Richmond student Kurt Schmitz, 22, was found unresponsive at the Eagle Mill Apartments in Richmond, Virginia on Sunday morning and was declared dead by emergency responders.

Authorities have said they do not suspect foul play or suicide but are still awaiting a cause of death from the medical examiner's office. The university said he passed away sometime overnight.

Schmitz had been staying at the apartments, where Virginia Commonwealth University students live, for the night, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.

Tragic: University of Richmond student Kurt Schmitz has been found dead at an off-campus apartment building. A cause of death is not yet known but authorities said they do not suspect foul play or suicide

The student, who was from Haskell, New Jersey, had been an offensive lineman for the football team in his freshman year but was forced to quit after four concussions.

He managed to hide three of them from coaches but realized the potential danger when he woke up from the fourth concussion in hospital, he told campus paper The Collegian in an interview.

'Guys on the team aren't Superman,' Schmitz said. 'You may want to play through days where you can't see straight, but from what I've experienced, it will catch you.'

The political science major said that his father convinced him not to return to the field and he was ultimately medically disqualified from playing.

But after he was sidelined, he stayed on the team to monitor players' safety and often warned students to make sure their helmets were fitted properly.

He urged the players to stop if they felt any pain or showed symptoms of concussions.

Teammates and coaches remembered Schmitz as a hard-working player and former high school wrestler.

'He was a tough guy and he was smart as well,' Aaron Corp, Richmond's former quarterback, told the Times-Dispatch. 'The offensive line is not the easiest position to play, especially as a freshman. He picked up things really fast.'

'He was a totally dedicated, tough kid that worked hard for everything,' his high school coach Greg Toal added to NJ Advance Media. 'He wrestled to make himself tough for football.'

Loss: The 22-year-old had stopped playing football after suffering concussions in his freshman year but he remained on the team to push for safety measures and educate players on concussions

'He was one of the nicest guys on the team,' said former high school classmate Mike Yankovich, who now plays for William & Mary.

'One of the things that sticks in my mind about him is that anytime something positive happened, I made a good run or something like that, he'd be the first kid to come over and say something positive.'

At Schmitz's high school, Don Bosco High, football players now wear helmets with sensors that alert coaches to players who have sustained hard hits to the head.

President Edward L. Ayers said in a statement that the university's thoughts and prayers are with Schmitz's family and friends.
