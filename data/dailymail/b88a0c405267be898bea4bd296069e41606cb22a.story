Assault: Captain Dale Walker admits hitting a policewoman in the face after she caught him urinating in an alley

An Army physiotherapist punched a policewoman in the face after he was caught relieving himself in an alleyway.

Captain Dale Walker told the unnamed officer to 'shut up' when she caught him urinating near Charing Cross station in central London.

He then thumped the policewoman in the face and ran away but he was later arrested.

The officer suffered severe bruising and swelling to her cheek after the attack in the early hours of February 27, 2011.

Captain Walker was later given a conditional caution by the Metropolitan Police, ordered to pay £1,000 compensation and write a letter of apology to the policewoman.

But he is now facing the Health and Care Professions Council over the incident.

He admits the assault but denies his fitness to practice has been impaired.

If found guilty he could be struck off as a physiotherapist.

Nicola Hill, for the HCPC, said: 'The incident occurred at 02:45 near Charing Cross.

'The police saw the defendant weeing on the wall and said to him "This is not a toilet", to which Captain Walker said "Shut up".

'As he walked away there was a tussle and he punched the PC with his right fist onto her left cheek.

'He managed to break free and ran away. The police then called for backup and asked for CCTV to identify the man.

'He was picked up with his hood up and hands in his pockets trying to blend into the crowd but was arrested at 02.55.

'He said he did nothing wrong but had been drinking since 2pm in the afternoon.'

Captain Walker had been out celebrating with friends at the Comedy Store before trying unsuccessfully to gain entry to some casinos in the West End.

Following his arrest he claimed the policewoman, who was small in stature, had grabbed him and he ran away because he was ashamed to be seen relieving himself against a wall.

Giving evidence, Captain Walker claimed he was not drunk at the time of the incident.

'I am deeply ashamed of the events of that night,' he said. 'I am embarrassed by what happened and it was completely out of character. I've never done anything like that before.

Hearing: Captain Walker faces being struck off as a physiotherapist if his is found guilty of the assault impairing his fitness to practice

'First of all, I had my back to the person so I could not identify them. I heard her shout 'Oi, oi, oi' and grabbed my right arm as I was walking away. 

'I thought I was being attacked so I pulled my arm away and ran away because I had a lot of money on me and my iPhone in my pocket.

'I deeply regret reacting the way I did and should not have been doing what I was doing in the first place.

'I only reacted that way because I felt threatened.'

'I deeply regret reacting the way I did and should not have been doing what I was doing in the first place.'

Captain Walker received the caution on 11 September 2011 but only reported the matter to the HCPC in April 2012.

He said the consequences of his actions have been severe professionally despite receiving full support and backing from his superiors.

Captain Walker said: 'I am staying where I am professionally and being monitored very closely.

'Everything I do is checked and it has limited my career. I am not allowed to be deployed to Afghanistan and I have been put in a management role rather than a clinical role.'

Captain Walker has been commended in the past for good service to the army and has continued to train while this case has been hanging over him.

He told the hearing he has cut down drinking excessively since the incident.

He admits two charges that he was issued with a conditional caution for assaulting a police constable and that he had to pay £1,000 compensation and write a letter of apology, but denies a third charge that his fitness to practice has been impaired.

The hearing continues.
