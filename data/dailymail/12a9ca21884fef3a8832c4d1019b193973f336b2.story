A teenager who choked on spaghetti as a child is today so terrified of food that she refuses to eat anything apart from chicken escalopes.

Charlotte Snow, from north London, has shunned most other foods since she was three years old, despite her parents' desperate attempts to improve their daughter's diet.

Her mother Carla Snow, 42, said she believes Charlotte's phobia stems from a near-death experience when she was three.

Despite her poor diet, repeated visits 
to the doctors have revealed she is suffering no health complications as
 a result of her phobia.

She said: 'I’ve been scared to try other foods since I can remember.

'Just
 the thought of putting other foods in my mouth and then not liking the 
taste makes me feel anxious. I don’t know what I would do if I ate 
something I wasn’t keen on.'

Her mother Mrs Snow, who works at a children's centre, said: 'When Charlotte was a 
baby, she ate everything and we had no problems at all.

'But one day, I 
was feeding her some spaghetti and she choked on the food.

'We
 patted Charlotte’s back and managed to get the spaghetti out. But that 
experience scarred her and ever since then, she’s turned her back on 
most foods and has been very fussy.

'We
 kept trying to put other foods in front of Charlotte but she would turn
 her nose up at them and rather starve. She could never get over her 
fears.

Until the spaghetti incident when she was three, Charlotte would eat most foods, her parents Carla and Nick (pictured) said

Despite her parents' desperate attempts to encourage Charlotte to expand her diet, the 18-year-old has resisted, only adding white bread, crisps and cereal to the equation

'Once, we even 
arranged for Charlotte to have an internal examination so we could find 
out if there was any deeper reason for her phobia.

'But she refused to 
eat the egg sandwich that she needed to consume before the test.'

The 18-year-old has been persuaded to add chips, crisps, bread and cereal to her limited list of foods she will eat.

But even with these foods, Charlotte is specific about the brands and varieties she will eat, preferring Walkers' Salt and Vinegar, Hovis white bread and Kellogg's Rice Krispies.

Charlotte admits her phobia impacts on her everyday life and makes socialising difficult.

She said: 'I find my phobias very embarrassing at times. If I go out to dinner with my friends and there’s no food there that I like, I’ll just starve the whole night and won’t eat.

Despite her poor diet, Charlotte has suffered no detrimental affect to her health

'If some boys that I don’t know well are joining us for dinner then I will arrive after the meal.

'I would be mortified just eating chips in front of the guys so it’s better to avoid the situation altogether.

'Often though, I will go for the whole day without food if there’s nothing available that I can eat.

'The other day I went to a party with my family and there was nothing on the menu I could eat. I was so famished that I had to rush out to the nearest McDonalds to get some chips.'

Despite doctors' assurance that Charlotte's health is not affected at the moment, her mother Mrs Snow said she is worried her poor diet could catch up with her.

'We regularly go to the doctor so that Charlotte can take a blood test but the results always come back fine. The doctors continually tell us that Charlotte’s healthy and growing,' she said.

'Nonetheless it does worry me that her poor diet will catch up with her and she will suffer health problems in the future because she’s not getting the nutrients she needs.'

Charlotte added: 'I would love to be able to eat more foods one day. It would be great to enjoy dinner with my friends and socialize more.'

A spokesperson for Triumph Over Phobia, the phobia charity said: 'Charlotte needs to have a course of exposure therapy to help her overcome her fear of food.

'She will only recover if she faces her fear and she can do this by taking little steps each day.'
