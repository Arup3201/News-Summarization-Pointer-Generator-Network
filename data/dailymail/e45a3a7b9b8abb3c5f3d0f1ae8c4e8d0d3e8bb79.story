Shamed singer Pete Doherty has walked free from prison just six weeks into a six-month sentence for drugs charges following the death of a society heiress.

The Babyshambles star has been allowed out on home detention curfew – which will see him wear a tag and confined to his home from 7pm to 7am – after serving only a quarter of his jail term.

His early release has been branded an insult to the relatives of Robyn Whitehead, a member of the wealthy Goldsmith family. Doherty was convicted for possessing crack cocaine in a squalid weekend that ended with her fatal overdose.

And there was further anger yesterday
as it emerged the 32-year-old singer had taunted the family of Miss 
Whitehead, 27, calling her filmmaker father, Peter, a ‘deranged old 
silly’.

In a blog posted just hours before he
was sentenced on May 20 – his third drug-related jail term – he claimed
the society beauty had begged him to inject her with drugs, to sleep 
with her on acid and to indulge in ‘black magic sex rituals’.

Doherty uses his self-serving rant to
say he refused to allow Miss Whitehead, who idolised him, to use crack 
or heroin, but admitting he once ‘banged her up’ – helped her take drugs
– when he found her trying to inject with a blunt needle. He said he wanted to make sure 
‘she did it safely’.

The former Libertines frontman also spoke out for 
the first time about his involvement in the death of Mark Blanco, 30, 
who fell off a balcony in 2006 after being ejected from a party in 
Whitechapel, East London, for belittling Doherty as a ‘hyped-up pop 
star’.

Miss Whitehead, granddaughter of 
Green Party founder Teddy Goldsmith and related to socialite Jemima Khan
and Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, died on January 24 last year after spending 
several days filming a documentary about the drug-addict rock star.

Doherty was convicted after police found a DVD filmed by Miss Whitehead showing him smoking crack cocaine with his friends.

But he refused to take any 
responsibility for her death, instead blaming a ‘propaganda campaign’ 
for suggesting that he led her astray.

He claimed: ‘She was a heavily 
involved recreational user and abuser of substances. I did not lead her 
astray at all. I loved her. I left her the day before she died p***** 
off that I wouldn’t give her any drugs.

‘She asked me for years to inject 
her, to score for her, to sleep with her on acid, to get into black 
magic sex rituals… never, never, never.’

He went on to abuse her father, 
saying: ‘Robyn’s father texted me that I am a “coward and a runt” and 
that I am to blame. She (Robyn) would be broken hearted if she knew that
I was not even invited to the funeral ... she was my best friend you 
deranged old silly.’ 

In the same blog, the singer also taunted Mark Blanco’s mother, Sheila, about her son’s death.

Doherty
was first arrested for possessing drugs in October 2005 and since then 
has repeatedly admitted possession of class A substances.

In 2008,
he served 29 days of a 14-week sentence in Wormwood Scrubs prison after
being arrested on drugs charges the previous year.

In 2003 
Doherty admitted burgling the home of former Libertines bandmate Carl 
Barat and was sentenced to six months in prison which was later cut to 
two on appeal.

While his former bandmates were on tour in Japan, 
Doherty allegedly kicked down the door to Barat’s basement flat in Harley Street 
and stole items including an antique guitar, laptop, video recorder, CD 
player, harmonica and books.

He wrote: ‘Or perhaps, Mrs Blanco, so
vocal in her condemnation of me in relation to her son’s death ... 
perhaps she’d be interested to know exactly what occurred that night?

‘Mrs Blanco, your son was well liked 
and well loved. The night he died he was intensely agitated ... He was 
ejected from Paul’s flat because of his aggressive and loud attempts to 
belittle me and assert his view that I was a hyped-up pop star.

‘When he left the flat he was alone and when he fell or jumped he was alone.’

Earlier this year, after two Scotland
Yard investigations, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was not 
enough evidence for a murder prosecution over the death of the Cambridge
graduate.

But last night Mrs Blanco said she was considering a private prosecution against Doherty.

She said: ‘If he knew Mark was alone, how did he know? I think it’s very insulting in a way.

‘It’s a joke. It’s the work of a coward deciding to say something when they are about to go to prison.’

And she blasted the decision to release him early, saying: ‘It feels like a celebrity privilege.’

Rock: The controversial singer, of Camden, North London, has twice
been jailed before and has repeatedly admitted possession of class A 
substances

Anti-drugs campaigner Sheilmor Twomey said last night: ‘It makes it worse for the family of Miss Whitehead. It’s an insult.’

Doherty, of Camden, North London, 
yesterday announced he was celebrating his freedom with a gig – in the 
afternoon as a result of his curfew – on Saturday.

But it may not be long before he is 
back behind bars. He could face up to five years in jail for allegedly 
breaking into a music shop during a drunken night out in Germany.

Yesterday Miss Whitehead’s family declined to comment.

The Prison Service said home 
detention curfews were available for ‘low-risk’ offenders who had served
a quarter of their sentence.
