A British grandmother on her dream holiday in Brazil died after she slipped on a walkway overlooking one of the world's largest waterfalls.

Shirley Baldry, a retired teacher, was visiting the 270ft Iguazu falls on the Argentinian border when she fell and broke her arm, an inquest heard.

She was flown to hospital in Rio de Janeiro, where doctors put a pin in her arm - but the 79-year-old from Tyne and Wear died just a few days later, after the shock caused her to have a heart attack.

Paying tribute to his wife of 60 years, husband Ted said: 'I loved everything about her, absolutely everything. She was just so important to me and everybody loved her.'

An inquest in Newcastle heard that Mrs Baldry had been on holiday with her daughter Stephanie in November last year when she suffered the accident.

Stephanie was initially told that the operation had gone well, but Mrs Baldry's condition continued to deteriorate and she died shortly afterwards.

A post-mortem carried out in Britain revealed that she had been suffering from ischaemic heart disease, exacerbated by the shock of the fall and her hospitalisation.

Pathologist Clive Bloxham told the inquest: 'I am inclined to put it as a contributing factor. It is recent and may have influenced the timing of what is essentially a heart attack.'

Coroner Karen Dilks recorded a verdict of accidental death.

'When I kissed her goodbye at Kings Cross I did not realise it would be the last time,' said Mr Baldry, 82.

'We had both wanted to go to Brazil. I could not and she had the air miles, and she went with Stephanie. She had the chance so I said go - it was only meant to be for five to six days.'

Mrs Baldry was a keen fitness fan, and could often be seen running along the beach with the family dog.

'We were both in a walking club, she was just so fit,' her husband said. 'Before she went away she did a 10-mile then a 12-mile walk, she went running on the beach with the dog.

'She would do that two to three times a day, she was never out of breath. Even our doctor couldn't believe it. He said she was the fittest person he had on the books.'

The couple, who had two children, met when Mr Baldry was studying at Durham University and they attending a student dance together.

He said: 'By the time we got down to the bus station she had not stopped talking and I just thought, "I am going to marry this girl."

'We did everything together, that was the thing. We went to Japan and India - she had been when she was 18 but had not seen the Taj Mahal. We also went to New Zealand.

'When we were younger we enjoyed going camping on the continent with the kids, we went to Switzerland all the time, we knew it inside out. She also loved the art galleries, she would see four in a morning when we went to London.'
