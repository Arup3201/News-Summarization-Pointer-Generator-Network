It has been a series dogged with scandal, secrets and surprises, but in the finale of Breaking Amish, the five cast members finally got their chance to reveal the truths about their past lives.

Whether or not they made the most of this opportunity to come clean is a different matter.

Two of the characters refused to admit they had dated before appearing on the show - despite neighbours claiming they lived together in a trailer with their baby daughter.

And other characters vehemently defended their questionable Amish lifestyles - including skimpy clothes, divorce, arrests and modelling careers - claiming they were 'normal'.

Since its first episode aired in September, the show has repeatedly come under fire for deceiving
viewers about the five Amish and Mennonite men and women it follows as 
they move to New York.

Defensive: Rebecca and Abe became enraged when asked about the paternity of her baby in the finale

Secret:
This photo of the couple, who the TLC show had claimed met for 'the 
first time' when they moved to New York for Breaking Amish, with a baby 
was posted on the internet weeks ago

Weeks after a photo was posted on Breaking Amish the Truth showing cast members Rebecca and Abe with a 
baby, Rebecca revealed she is divorced and confirmed she is a mother.

But on the show's finale on Sunday, she refused to name the father of the baby. While Abe is rumoured to be the dad, the couple claims they only started dating on the show.

'I'm very sensitive when it comes to my 
daughter because I'm trying to be a good mom,' Rebecca said as she refused to
talk about her child. 'I don't have to answer to anybody.'

She continued: '[Fans] can believe whatever they 
want, but if they want to know, they can watch the show. If they don't 
want to believe, they don't have to believe it.

Caught out: Rebecca claimed this photo of her in a bathing suit was taken when she 'snuck out'

Past life: She has also explained that her teeth were all pulled out when she was 19 so she uses dentures

'I don't give a s***
what anybody thinks. People have to discuss our lives so much that we 
can't even have our own life anymore. They're making us out to be 
somebody I don't even know.'

But while the couple refused to go into further details, friends have not been so shy, 
revealing that Rebecca and Abe lived together while she was pregnant.

'They stayed in a camper behind our 
home for several months in 2010 while Rebecca was pregnant with their 
baby girl,' Shannon Edwards, from Columbia, Kentucky told the National 
Enquirer.

It has already been revealed that Rebecca left her first husband, Rufus Hostetler, to start a relationship with Abe in 2010. She was also filmed marrying Abe on the show.

Rebecca was not to silent on other aspects of her former life, revealing that her teeth appeared different in earlier photos as she has since had them all removed and replaced with dentures.

Final say: The cast members were given the chance to respond to accusations in the finale on Sunday

She explained that her parents made the decision when she was 19 to pull out all of her teeth, claiming it is an Amish tradition, yet dentists in the community have no formal training.

She also attempted to explain an image on Facebook of her wearing a bikini - which is forbidden in her strict Amish community. She looked shocked when presented with the photo.

'Uh oh,' she said. 'No one's supposed to find out. I only wore a bikini one time.'

When quizzed about the swimsuit, she snapped back: 'I'm wearing a bikini because I felt like it. Big deal, I snuck out, I had fun and never told nobody about it because nobody needs to know.'

The other cast members didn't get off the hook about revelations made by friends and family members on the Facebook group, Breaking Amish The Truth.

Denial: Jeremiah, who is divorced with three children, denied assaulting his wife and said he pays child support

Revealed: Jeremiah's wife, Naomi Stutzman, spoke to CBS21 about how Jeremiah repeatedly attacked her

Jeremiah was given the chance to respond
to revelations he is divorced from a woman who claims he repeatedly beat her
- and with whom he has three children, aged seven, five and three.

The children live with their mother, Naomi Stutzman, 
in Ohio. The couple married in 2005 and she filed for divorce in 2011, 
citing gross neglect of duty, extreme cruelty and incompatibility.

Speaking to CBS21,
Stutzman, who has also left the Amish community, called the show 'a 
fake' and claimed: 'The kids and I suffered for years at the hands of this man.'

On one occasion, he punched her in 
the stomach while she was pregnant, a police report notes, while other records reveal he did not pay child support.

'Do your frickin' homework,' Jeremiah said. 'I did spend three days in jail for 
supposedly [abusing her]. The court threw it out. I regret
that I didn't pay child support in the past, but I'm paying it now.'

Wild: Pictures also show Jeremiah, left, surrounded by friends swigging from beer cans

Trust: Abe and Sabrina had earlier revealed they had sex during the show's filming and it was 'stupid'

And Sabrina, the only Mennonite in the 
group, was given the chance to comment on photographs showing her 
getting married while wearing a decidedly non-Mennonite dress.

She
was married in 2009 and has not been a practicing Mennonite 
for years, friends claim. Other photographs on Facebook show her in skimpy clothing.

But Sabrina said that the ceremony adhered to the community's traditions, there was no dancing or alcohol and she had a panel fitted into her dress to conceal her chest.

'I'm not ashamed I was married,' she said, confirming that her divorce is still pending. I still love him - he's a good man and 
he's honorable. I have nothing but good things to say about him.'

In the first part of the finale, 
which aired last week, Jeremiah and Sabrina had admitted they had sex 
during the filming - throwing yet more doubts on their devotion to their
faiths.

Double life: Facebook photos apparently showed Sabrina kissing a man and wearing skimpy clothes

Insistence: But she maintained her wedding in 2009 was traditionally Mennonite, despite how it appeared

While a cast member claimed the couple had sex in a hotel lobby's bathroom, Sabrina denied it.

Jeremiah added: 'If the world wants to know, we did it and enjoyed it.'

'And I made him stop,' Sabrina said. 'I was drunk both times. We were both trashed and started messing around. He sticks it in, and I
was like, No! I made him take it out. I don't consider that 
actually doing it.'

Jeremiah was also reportedly away from his Amish community for up to 14 years and is pictured on social networking sites surrounded by beer cans.

TLC has also previously admitted that the fifth and final cast member,
Kate, who is billed as an Amish bishop's daughter and aspiring model, 
has been arrested for a DUI.

New life: On the show, Kate finds modelling work and wears a variety of skimpy outfits

But blogs revealed she also previously submitted images to modeling agencies - which is at odds
with the Amish stance against photographs, believing they represent 
'vanity' which they deem a sin.

Online
records show that Kate posted a photograph on exploretalent.com to 
enter a Best Smile contest in 2010 - years before she claimed she gave 
up her Amish life to move to the city.

She is pictured on her wedding day in a ceremony that is not traditionally Mennonite.

The apparent betrayal by the creators of Breaking Amish is documented on a Facebook page, Breaking Amish the Truth, on which people who claim to know the cast have vented their anger.

Scores of people have also uploaded photographs showing the cast in their 'real' lives.

In
response to the outrage, TLC said it would address the revelations 
in time, which it has now attempted to do with the two-part finale.

'There is a lot of information 
floating around about the group featured on Breaking Amish. Much of it 
is not true, but some of it is - and is addressed in upcoming episodes,'
TLC told Variety.
