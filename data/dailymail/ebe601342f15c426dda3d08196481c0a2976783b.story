A celebrity restaurateur is being sued by disgruntled ex-staff following a row over allegedly unpaid wages when one of his exclusive venues  suddenly closed.

Riad Erraji - who was once married to Atomic Kitten's Natasha Hamilton but is currently dating Hollyoaks actress Stephanie Waring - was taken to court after his restaurant 'House' shut in October.

Staff accused him of leaving chefs, bar staff and waitresses without a month's worth of pay when the venue in Worcester closed 'without warning'.

Riad Erraji was seen partying with celebrity girlfriend Stephanie Waring - who plays Cindy Cunningham in Hollyoaks - this weekend, but staff at a restaurant of his which closed say they are owed wages

The 38-year-old businessman - who also owns the Amanzi restaurant and Empire nightclub in Liverpool - opened his latest restaurant in May 2013 but it shut late last year costing workers between £9,000 and £11,000 in lost wages.

Court action is now being brought against Mr Erraji and his companies Hamiltons Worcester Ltd and the Echelon Group to recoup the cash.

Worcester County Court heard bailiffs visited the empty restaurant on January 16 to try and recover some of the money - but found just mouldy coffee cups and kitchen furniture.

Enforcement officers have revealed they were dealing with a number of former staff who are said to be owed up to £1,335 each.

The premises has now been reclaimed by Crown Estates, which owns the CrownGate Shopping Centre, where the restaurant was situated.

Mr Erraji was unavailable for comment today. 

The actress tweeted photos of her, Mr Erraji and their friends  as they celebrated his birthday on Saturday

Mr Erraji is famous for being the ex-husband of Atomic Kitten's Natasha Hamilton. The pair split in 2013

House, which was opened  in 2013, was described by Mr Erraji as a 'premier Worcester venue for premier people'.

His Liverpool venues are popular with celebrities including model Danielle Lloyd, X-factor singer Marcus Collins and footballer Brad Jones's fiancee Dani Lawrence.

Mr Erraji is also close friends with singer Peter Andre as well as Coronation Street's Kym Marsh.

Ramsay Floyd, centre manager for the shopping centre, said: 'We confirm that following the closure of the unit in October last year, House failed to reopen. The lease for the unit has now been brought to an end and the unit is vacant.

'This has allowed us to clean up the areas visible for the mall but the unit has not been let to a new tenant.

'However, we have had expressions of interest for some of the items left in the unit from local businesses.'
