Besiktas coach Slaven Bilic refused to critise referee  Pedro Proenca after the Turkish side were denied a penalty in Wednesday's Champions League clash.

The former West Ham defender was furious that a penalty was not awarded when Ramon Motta appeared to be clipped from behind by Jack Wilshere.

Controversy: Referee Pedro Proenca waved away Beskitas appeals for a penalty

Arsenal held on to secure a 1-0 win on aggregate and book a lucrative place in the group stage of the Champions League. 

Bilic, who watched from the stands as he served a touchline ban for arguing with an official during the first leg, refused to blame the decision for their exit and instead praised his side and aiming at a tilt at Europa League glory.

'We are disappointed on one hand but also so proud. My team gave Arsenal 180 very open minutes', he said.

'We didn't give up and in the last 10-15 minutes we were very exciting and they were on the ropes. Not many teams have done that to Arsenal on their home ground.

'They showed a little bit of extra quality in the box. 

'We are very, very gutted because we were so close to going through - we are going to come out of this very positive and go in the Europa League.

'We are not there just to particpate, we want to do business there and go very far. If we continue to play like this or better, with a couple of more players.

'We can go far in the Europa League and fight for the Turkish Championship which is always a priority for our club.'
