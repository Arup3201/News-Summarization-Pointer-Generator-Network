This £300,000 end-of-terrace house may have almost trebled in value after a work of art was covertly painted on one of its walls overnight.

The mural, which shows three secret agents eavesdropping on conversations at a phone box, is thought to have been created by the mysterious street artist Banksy.

It was spotted on Sunday morning on Karen Smith’s house in Cheltenham, Glouvestershire a few miles from the GCHQ surveillance base.

Ms Smith, 48, heard voices outside in the early hours but thought nothing 
of it until she spotted men loading huge screens into a van in the 
morning.

Creation: The new graffiti street art piece, suspected of being a Banksy, which appeared on the side of a house in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire

Taking a look: People crowd around a new graffiti street art piece, which is thought to be a nod to the town's role as the home for Government spy centre GCHQ

Camera phones: The three 1950s-style spies in the picture are carrying listening devices and crowded around a real telephone box outside the home

The mother-of-five watched them 
drive off before finding the painting on the side of her three-bed semi-detached house.

The three 1950s-style spies in
 the picture are carrying listening devices and crowded around a real 
telephone box outside her home.

Experts say it is a genuine Banksy and is thought to be a nod to the town’s role as the home for Government spy centre GCHQ..

A
 similar work of art cut off brickwork in east London sold recently for 
£500,000.

But
 full-time mother Ms Smith, who said the artwork was 'pretty amazing', 
won’t profit from it - because she only rents the house from a private 
landlord.

'I heard male 
voices outside in the early hours but it wasn’t until I saw the 
tarpaulin screen at about 7.30am I thought anything of it.

Questions: The painting is yet to be officially claimed by the secretive artist, but graffiti experts say it has all the tell-tale traits of the Bristol-born creator

Closer-up: Pictures of the work were also posted on Facebook by Robin Gunningham - a name often linked to the secretive artist

Value: Full-time mother Karen Smith, 48, won¿t profit from the alleged Banksy - because she only rents the house on which it was painted from a private landlord

‘I thought it might be something to do with the police, like when a crime happens.

'It’s pretty good. It livens the street up a bit'

Karen Smith

'When I came out I saw people staring at it and asked them what they were looking at.

‘There was also a van with writing all over it where they were putting the screens in.’

She added: ‘When I saw it I hadn’t even heard of Banksy.

'But as soon as my daughter saw it she knew straight away and told me how popular he is.

'It’s pretty good. It livens the street up a bit.’

Meaning: Experts say it is a genuine Banksy and is thought to be a nod to Cheltenham's role as the home for Government spy centre GCHQ (pictured)

Pricey: Earlier this year 'Girl with Red Balloon' was chain-sawed off a wall in Shoreditch, east London, after someone bought it for £500,000

Expensive: The famous 'Kissing Coppers' sold for £350,000 in February after it was removed from a Brighton pub 10 years ago

Unusual: Banksy has used telephone boxes in his work before, including in this piece, which appeared in an alley in Soho, London, in 2006

Ms Smith added: I’ve heard 
they can be worth a lot. I’ve been trying to get hold of my landlord but
 they haven’t got back to me.’

Banksy has yet to claim the Cheltenham piece as his own, but 
fans say it has his trademark ‘narrative, style and execution’.

Website
 streetartnews said: ‘At the break of dawn, the British street artist 
showed up with a maintenance van and covered all the sides with 
tarpaulin to execute his new stencil.

‘While
 not officially confirmed by his website, this piece has all the Banksy 
characteristics in narrative, style and execution.’

Cheltenham
 street artist Dice67 said: ‘It’s definitely Banksy. It’s brilliant. 
Graffiti is definitely all about location.

'That’s why he’s come to 
Cheltenham, to do something about GCHQ.

‘People will travel to Cheltenham from all over the world to see this.’

Pictures of the work were also posted on Facebook by Robin Gunningham - a name often linked to the secretive artist.

A spokesman for GCHQ said: 'This is the first time we have ever been asked to comment on art.'

Jane
 Griffiths, director of commissioning at Cheltenham Borough Council said
 the artwork could be protected, with permission from the landlord.

Abroad: His work has not been confined to the UK - the mysterious artist sprayed this image on the Israeli West Bank Barrier

Machine: This Banksy image caught the eye of commuters after it mysteriously appeared in a bricked up window in 2007 in Finsbury, north London

Famous: The Rude Lord (left) was sold in London in 2007 for £320,900, while Space Girl and Bird (right) went for £288,000

High price: Keep it Spotless, a 2007 Banksy, sold in New York in 2008 for £1,111,900. It is the most expensive piece of his artwork ever sold

‘The council cannot condone graffiti which is put onto people's property without their permission,’ she said.

‘However, we recognise that the public do see work by Banksy as significant pieces of public art and it is clear that this piece has been getting a huge amount of favourable attention. It would be a shame if it was removed or damaged.

‘As the artwork is on private property, it is the for the property owner to decide whether they would want it to be kept - they would need to consider the impact this may have on the residents of the property and the wider community.

‘Although we still do not know if it is original work by Banksy, given the public interest, we would be happy to help the owner find a solution which would protect it from tagging or other graffiti.’
