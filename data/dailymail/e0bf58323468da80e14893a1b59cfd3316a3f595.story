One of the men arrested in a crackdown on suspected paedophiles is a junior doctor working in paediatrics.

Raza Laskar, 31, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, is accused of sexual activity with a child and possessing indecent images of children. He faces trial later this year.

Chief Superintendent Caroline Ball said: ‘We know this man has worked in hospitals right across Greater Manchester and we understand the public will undoubtedly be concerned upon hearing about the offences with which he has been charged.’

660 suspected paedophiles have been arrested following a crackdown by the National Crime Agency (NCA). The organisation targeted those across the country who had accessed images of child abuse online (library image)

Police revealed last week that more than 660 men, many in positions of trust, were questioned during the six-month nationwide Operation Notarise. Most had no previous contact with police.

The men include retired chemistry teacher Ian Bell, 66, from Wimborne in Dorset.

He was imprisoned for  28 months at Bournemouth Crown Court last month after being convicted of 20 offences of possessing and distributing indecent images and movies of children.

Another man, married insurance salesman Richard Wilson, 50, from West Parley, Dorset, was jailed for eight months on Friday after admitting 16 counts of possessing indecent images of children.

On his laptop he had 8,553 pictures and 246 videos, including a 23-minute clip of child abuse. Police say 431 children  ‘in the care, custody or control’ of suspects have been protected.
