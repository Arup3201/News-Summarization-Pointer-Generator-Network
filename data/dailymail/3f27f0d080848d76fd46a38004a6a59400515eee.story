The 12th Duke of Marlborough led mourners at the funeral of the 11th Duke, his father John Spencer-Churchill, at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire today.

Jamie Blandford, 58, previously the Marquess of Blandford, walked arm in arm with his stepmother, his father's fourth wife Lily Mahtani, as they followed the 11th Duke's coffin carried by gamekeepers in plus fours into the church of St Mary Magdalene in Woodstock.

Earlier, uniformed staff from the palace and estate workers bowed their heads as the horse-drawn carriage containing the Duke's coffin made its way through the parkland of the 11,500-acre estate to the private service.

A flag bearing the family crest flew at half-mast over the palace, a Unesco World Heritage Site, and its formal gardens were closed today for the funeral, held just over a week after the 11th Duke died aged 88.

After the service, the 12th Duke of Marlborough led the funeral procession as it followed the coffin back to Blenheim Palace on foot

The park remained open, however, and entrance charges were waived so that members of the public wishing to pay their respects could do so.

Hundreds of people lined the streets of Woodstock to watch the funeral cortege pass by on its way to the church, where the new Duke of Marlborough gave a reading, as did his siblings Lady Alexandra, Lord Edward, and Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill.

Sir Mark Weinberg also gave a tribute, and the Rector of the Benefice of Blenheim, Rev Canon Adrian Daffern, said the Duke was a 'man of authority, tempered by his humanity.'

He added: 'He loved the estate and he loved this county.'

After the service the coffin was carried out of the church to be taken back to the palace, followed by the funeral party on foot, with the 12th Duke at the front of the procession. 

The 11th Duke married four times; first WHSmith heiress Susan Hornby, mother of his first three children, two of whom survive, second Athina Onassis, with whom he had no children, third Rosita Douglas-Sjernorp, mother of his three younger children, two of whom survive, and fourth, Persian-born Lily Mahtani. 

His four children are the Marquess of Blandford, Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill, 56, Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill, 40, and Lady Alexandra Spencer-Churchill, 38.

The marquess, his eldest surviving child, battled addictions to heroin and cocaine and three spells in prison, which resulted in his father taking legal action to prevent him from inheriting the 11,500-acre estate, where Churchill was born.

During this time the 11th Duke and his son the Marquess of Blandford were estranged for more than 20 years, but in 2008, in a move largely credited to behind the scenes work by the Duke's fourth wife, Lily Mahtani, they were finally reunited after a reconciliation.

Blandford and his second wife, Welsh ceramicist Edla Griffiths, who was said to have been a stabilising influence on him, moved into a farmhouse on the Blenheim estate and he was given a role developing the Blenheim farm shop. 

Today a spokesman at Blenheim Palace, which was was built in the 18th Century as a gift to the first duke, John Churchill, and was the birthplace of Winston Churchill, confirmed that the 12th Duke would also now inherit the estate.

The Blenheim estate is one of Britain's most notable tourist attractions, and it was the Duke's life's work to preserve it for future generations.

A gift from Queen Anne to John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough, in 1704, it was a reward for his victory over the army of Louis XIV of France in the Spanish War of Succession.

Winston Churchill was born at Blenheim, which became a world heritage site under the stewardship of the 12th Duke. The 200,000sq ft estate has 187 rooms, dwarfing Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle,and attracts about 500,000 visitors every year.

Its grandeur registered even with Hitler. According to wartime lore, he planned to move in after invading England and ordered the Luftwaffe not to bomb it.
