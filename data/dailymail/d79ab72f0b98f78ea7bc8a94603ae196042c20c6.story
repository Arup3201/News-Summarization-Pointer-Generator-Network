NYPD officer Kevin Brennan was shot in the head

A sneering murder suspect lapped up attention on his way to arraignment on Wednesday for allegedly shooting a New York City police officer, kissing the air and smiling for family as he wrestled with cops who hauled him inside in handcuffs.

Police say 29-year-old officer Kevin Brennan was shot in the base of the skull by 21-year-old fugitive Luis 'Baby' Ortiz at a Brooklyn housing project.

Wrists shacked as he was led from the 90th precinct to Brooklyn Criminal Court he proudly told onlookers 'Yeah, take a picture of me'.

As the New York Post reports, Ortiz told his family 'I love you guys' as he was led away in front of family members.

The newspaper reports his sister slammed the trunk of a car he was led into and screamed 'F*** the police' before she was subdued by officers.

Kevin Brennan, 29, was hailed by colleagues after being hit in the base of the skull when he and two other officers responded to reports of shots being fired at Bushwick houses in Brooklyn.

The plain-clothes cops had arrived at the scene to see three men running out of a building and immediately set off in pursuit.

One of the fugitives, 21-year-old Luis 'Baby' Ortiz, led officer Brennan into the lobby of a building where he spun round and fired two shots.

Brennan, who has a six-week-old daughter, was able to let off a single shot in return before collapsing on the ground in a pool of blood.

Eyewitnesses say that within minutes around 30 officers were at the scene.

'We saw film of this event this 
morning. We saw where the gun was held right up to the officer's head. 
You see Ortiz with his arm around the officer’s head. He’s shot and he 
doesn’t move after he’s shot,' he said, showing the bullet encased in 
plastic to reporters.

Mayor Bloomberg said he had managed to exchange a few words with Brennan who was slipping in and out of consciousness.

Mr Bloomberg said: 'He understood he was hit and he said he was in a lot of pain but we joked about his daughter.

'Tonight we have someone who has dedicated his life to protecting all of us, who has had a much too close brush with death.'
