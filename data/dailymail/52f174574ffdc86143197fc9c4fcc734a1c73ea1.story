Australian pop culture lovers got a taste of the hotly anticipated Better Call Saul, just an hour after the Breaking Bad spin-off aired in the United States.

To the delight of many in Australia, the series premiered on Monday night at 6pm AEDT on the brand new streaming service Stan.

The show was fast-tracked by the service, which was launched through a partnership between Fairfax Media and Nine Entertainment Company, airing almost immediately after the show screened in the US.

The service has been labelled a game-changer by many Australians, who have previously resorted to illegally downloading or streaming shows in order to keep up with the episode release schedules of their favourite series.

The country had record piracy figures after hit HBO series Game of Thrones was downloaded illegally nearly 2 million times after the season finale aired last year.

A spokesperson for Australia's peak consumer body, Choice, said Foxtel's exclusive rights deal with HBO to air Game of Thrones two hours after the U.S. on Showcase had effectively forced consumers unwilling to pay for the cable company's monthly packages to seek alternative means of accessing premium content.

The fast-tracking offered by Stan may solve some of the piracy issues, allowing fans to pay for the convenience of streaming without the hassle of downloading.

'Better Call Saul was the number one title on Stan from the moment it was made available at 6pm, immediately following its West Coast transmission in the US,' said a spokesperson from Nine.

'Strong viewing figures continued well into the night and this morning,' the spokesperson told Mashable.

US network AMC reported that Better Call Saul pulled 6.5 million viewers, a record audience in cable history in the age bracket of 18 to 49.  

Stan costs $10 per month and promises just over 750 TV shows, films and documentaries for online viewing. 

Joining the lineup of exclusives - thanks to deals signed with Sony, BBC Worldwide, ABC, SBS, and Viacom - will be shows including Masters of Sex, Hannibal, Ray Donovan, Californication, The Good Wife, Sherlock, Call the Midwife, Top Gear and Doctor Who.

It comes ahead of the launch of Netflix Down Under, and after Foxtel's new streaming service launched earlier this month, as the video on demand revolution heats up in Australia. 

The Australian government engaged in harsh tactics to crackdown on illegal downloading last year, and a student was fined $500 for illegally downloading a television series on his University Wi-Fi network.

The anonymous 27-year-old graduate from the University of NSW spoke out after the University has vowed to issue $1000 fine to anyone breaching their rules of acceptable internet usage .

The graduate received a fine in his email Inbox within one hour of downloading Comedy Central's The Daily Show in 2011.
