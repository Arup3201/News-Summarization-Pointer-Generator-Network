The three-day 'festival of the pooch' has kicked off to a fun-filled start, with organisers for Sydney's Dog Lovers Show expecting around 20,000 visitors over the next few days.

Following Melbourne's successful Dog Lovers Show in March, over 1.2 million registered dogs in New South Wales have signed up to be apart of the three day event in Sydney. 

Dog devotees and their little pooches enjoyed a day filled with educational canine activities and interactive dog games on Friday at Sydney's Royal Hall of Industries in Moore Park.

Small dogs, big dogs, white dogs, black dogs and multi-coloured dogs had a day of tail-wagging fun, as they swam in the pool and played educational games with their owners. 

The canine event will feature more than 200 exhibitors, welcome close to 600 dogs on show and dozens of pooch experts.

Dog enthusiasts are able to ask for free advice when it comes to the four-legged pooch at the Ask-A-Vet stand, pooches will compete in water aquatics at the Dock Dogs and Pat-A-Pooch allows everyone to cuddle dogs of all sizes in the play-pen.

The award winning Dog Lovers Show is the ultimate event for dog lovers of all ages, paying tribute to the  unconditional love given by  man's best friend.
