They are said to be the closest living species to us humans and share many of our behavioral traits.

And it seems that chimpanzees chose their friends in the same way as us too.

Scientists from universities in Zurich and Vienna found that, like us, chimpanzees tend to partner up those they have the most in common with.

The researchers findings, published in the scientific journal Evolution and Human Behaviour, reveal that chimps choose their friends based on their behavioural and emotional states.

The scientists observed almost 40 primates in two zoos, monitoring who they formed bonds with, who they tended to sit with and what sort of personalities they had.

The results suggest that more outgoing friendly chimps tended to make friends with similarly outgoing chimps, while less sociable chimps tended to stick together.

The finding mirrors the known 'similarity effect' in humans.

Jorg Massen, from the University of Vienna, said: 'We found that, especially among unrelated friends, the most sociable and bold individuals preferred the company of other highly sociable and bold individuals, whereas shy and less sociable ones spent time with other similarly aloof and shy chimpanzees.'

Sonja Koski of the University of Zurich told Discovery News: 'The groups consisted of many males and females, and individuals formed cooperative friendships.

'Our results suggest that the preference to form these friendships with individuals much like oneself was present in the ancestor of chimpanzees and humans.'

Previous studies on other primates such as baboons saw similar results.

Earlier this year, scientists discovered more about why chimpanzees strike up such close, yet non-sexual, bonds with other non-related chimps.

The team of international researchers found that increased levels of the hormone oxytocin played an intrinsic role in non-kin co-operation.
