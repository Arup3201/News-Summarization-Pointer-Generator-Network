A woman left almost bald by an impulsive disorder compelling her to tear her hair out, has finally got a full head of locks after undergoing cosmetic treatment.

Cheryl Mitchell has suffered with trichotillomania (TTM) since she was five-years-old, but has faced a 13 year battle with doctors to receive a diagnosis and then get treatment. 

The 33-year-old from Rhyl, North Wales, finally recognised her own symptoms after reading a magazine article about the rare condition when she was 20 years old.

The mother-of-five is now celebrating after receiving her first full head of hair in almost 30 years after undergoing therapy that involved stitching extensions into a mesh barrier that is fixed to her scalp.

Transformation: Cheryl Mitchell was left almost bald, pictured right, by an impulsive disorder that compelled her to tear her hair out. The 33-year-old has finally got a full head of locks, pictured left, after undergoing cosmetic treatment.

She said: 'It feels really strange having long hair because for so many years I only had patches of hair or nothing at all.

Mrs Mitchell had to pay the £800 for the treatment herself because it is deemed a 'cosmetic procedure.' 

'It was really strange because I'd wake up with bald patches on my head - I didn't have a clue what had happened,' she said.

'I visited doctors on a regular basis and I started seeing psychiatrists when I was around 11-years-old but they didn't seem to know what the problem was.

'I found myself wanting to pull my hair out and I couldn't stop myself - it gradually got worse and worse as I got older.

'It seems really strange but it's not much different from people biting their nails or anything like that.

'It was really difficult for me because people would stare and make jokes about me having no hair - it was very upsetting.

Before: Mrs Mitchell said she could not stop herself pulling her hair out and it got worse the older she got

'I suffered a lot of abuse as well which was so hard to take - people said I would pull my hair out just to get attention which was really cruel.

'I also lost my father when I was 14-years-old so I had a pretty traumatic childhood which didn't help.

'To be given a full head of hair for the first time after almost 30 years of having the condition is a huge relief.

'Even though I'm still getting used to it, I feel much more confident since I had the therapy.'

It is not known what causes TTM but it usually starts in teenagers, more often girls, at the age of 11 to 13.

Mrs Mitchell first noticed the problem when she was five-years-old but over time she found the urge to tear out her hair grew.

Mrs Mitchell, pictured with her husband Graham, underwent treatment at The Hair Confidante in London on December 3

She was often left in agony and was tormented throughout her time at school due to the affects of the condition.

But the former care home nurse received the treatment at The Hair Confidante in London on December 3.

She is now adjusting to life with her new hair and admits her husband, Graham, 45, and children, Alex, 11, Adam, 12, Sam, nine, Claire, eight and Holly, seven have been thrilled to see their mum's new locks.

She said: 'It feels really strange having long hair because for so many years I only had patches of hair or nothing at all.

'It's grown around an inch-and-a-half since I had the procedure last month so I have to get it adjusted every three or four weeks.

'I've set up a Facebook group to help people with the condition.

'Hopefully it will help to raise awareness and make people feel more comfortable with talking about it.'

Trichtillomania is a condition where sufferers are compelled to tear their hair out.

It is common in teenagers and young adults, affects up to four in every 100 people.

They can pull hair from their head, as well as other places including their eyebrowns and eyelashes.

Trichtillomania is an impulse-control disorder - a psychological condition where you are unable to stop yourself carrying out a particular action.

Sufferers experience an intense urge to pull their hair out, and growing tension until they do.

Once they've pulled their hair out, they are overcome by a sense of relief.

The condition, which leaves sufferers with bald patches, can invoke negative feelings, including guilt.

People feel embarrassed and ashamed, and may try to deny it and cover it up.

Experts do not know what causes the compulsion, but some believe it is a form of addiction.

Others think it is a reflection of a mental health problem, with psychological and behaviourial theories suggesting it is a means of relieving stress and anxiety.

In some cases experts believe the condition amounts to self-harm, deliberate injury to achieve temporary relief from emotional distress.

Recognised treatments for the condition include psychotherapy, allowing patients to talk about the emotional problems underlying their compulsion.

Cognitive behaviourial therapy may be recommended, helping a person manage their problems by changing how they think and act.
