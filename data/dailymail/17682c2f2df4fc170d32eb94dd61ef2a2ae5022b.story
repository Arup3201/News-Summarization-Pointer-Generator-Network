Taxpayers forked out a quarter of a million pounds to send Shrien Dewani to South Africa for a murder trial which collapsed before his defence even began.

The care home tycoon from Bristol was sent to face a South African court after the murder of his new wife Anni in 2010, after allegations he had arranged for her to be killed.

The 35-year-old was sensationally cleared in early December when the judge threw out the case and panned the evidence of the  main prosecution witness as 'riddled with contradictions'.

Cleared: Shrien Dewani is pictured left at Western Cape High Court for the start of his trial in Cape Town, South Africa, on charges of arranging his wife Anni's murder. Right, the happy couple on their wedding day

A report in the Daily Mirror says the Crown Prosecution Service spent £87,908 on QCs and £48,612 on junior counsel for the hearings leading up to Mr Dewani's extradition.

The paper said a Freedom of Information request showed a further £23,464 was spent on psychiatric reports after Mr Dewani was diagnosed with stress-related mental health problems.

It reported that the CPS revealed its solicitors had spent 496 hours on the case. Estimating the briefs were paid about £69 per hour, reporters Jeremy Armstrong and Jonathan Corke calculated that their fees added £34,000 to the cost.

'Police, transport, medical and other costs are likely to push the total bill to a quarter of a million pounds,' they wrote, adding that the Home Office and Scotland Yard also paid out during the extradition process but those figures were not included. 

Mr Dewani walked free after being cleared of any part in the killing despite Judge Jeanette Traverso saying that many 'unanswered questions' still surrounding the case.

The decision to acquit Mr Dewani provoked a furious reaction from Anni's family who said they had been 'failed' by the justice system and would 'suffer sleepless nights for the rest of our lives'.

They were outraged that Mr Dewani did not give evidence, choosing instead to have a statement read out by his lawyer at the start of the trial in which he admitted that he is bisexual in an apparent attempt to dismiss speculation over a possible motive for the murder.

Furious: Ami Denborg, Anni's sister, weeps as she makes a statement expressing her shock at the South African justice system as she stands with Anni's brother Anish Hindocha, and her father Vinod Hindocha

Ashok Hindocha, Anni's uncle, said at the time: 'I was furious at the judge from day one - she just wanted to wrap up the case as quickly as possible. She appeared to be determined to have no time at all for the prosecution case.

'The way she spoke to Adrian Mopp, the prosecutor, was truly shocking. You can't speak to a prosecutor like he's an idiot - it was embarrassing to listen to.

'I felt sorry for him - she just never gave him a chance from the first day.'

Mr Hindocha also vowed to meet Mr Dewani in court again after renewing the family's pledge to sue Mr Dewani for hiding his gay trysts.

They believe they have grounds for legal action against Mr Dewani for leading Anni into marriage without revealing his sexuality and for compensation for the money the Hindocha family spent on the £200,000 wedding.  

Return: Mr Dewani in the back of a car being driven home from Gatwick after flying back from South Africa

Twenty-four hours after he was cleared of involvement in the murder of Anni during their honeymoon Dewani left South Africa at the first opportunity on a £3,000 first class flight.

The millionaire businessman then travelled in his own private pod on an Emirates Airlines flight from Dubai that touched down at 6.16am at Gatwick on December 10.

The Home Office told the Daily Mirror that none of the money the UK taxpayer spent on the case is recoverable from South African authorities.
