It is the largest - and one of the most glittering - annual receptions the monarch holds at Buckingham Palace.

Little wonder, then, that the Duchess of Cambridge was determined to shine.

Arriving at tonight’s Diplomatic Reception in a chauffeur-driven Bentley, Kate sported in public for the first time since her wedding a dazzling tiara, believed to have been loaned to her by the Queen.

With her long, dark locks swept back 
in a half-up half-down hairstyle to show off the delicate diamonds to 
their best advantage, the Duchess, 31, looked more regal than ever.

The Duchess was wearing a bespoke evening gown by Alexander McQueen.

Kensington Palace confirmed tonight that the tiara had belonged to Princess Margaret.

It is a 
particularly delicate diamond tiara of fanned motifs crowned by floating
 diamond arches and studded with two pearls at the base and a central 
top pearl.

Glittering: The stunning tiara is thought to have belonged to the Queen Mother

Big occasion: It is thought to be the first time the Duchess has been seen wearing a tiara since the Royal wedding in 2011

It was made from one of her wedding gifts, a necklace of a Greek key pattern with pendant diamonds and pearls given by her husband, the future George VI. Jewellers Garrard dismantled it and created a tiara instead.

The
 Queen Mother often wore it as a young woman before handing it down to 
her youngest daughter, Princess Margaret, who also loaned it to Serena 
Stanhope for her wedding to Margaret’s son Viscount Linley.

Although
 Prince William and his wife have studiously avoided attending any state
 banquets since their wedding (when a tiara is obligatory), claiming 
they are left to senior working royals, tonight’s reception was 
something of a three-line whip.

There
 are 172 Foreign Missions currently accredited to the Court of St 
James’s in London, because St. James’s Palace is still the senior palace
 and official residence of the Sovereign.

Each
 year the Queen throws a lavish reception in their honour, where members
 of the royal family make a point of meeting and greeting each one.

A piece of history: The beautiful tiara was owned by the Queen Mother and handed down to Princess Margaret. Kensington Palace confirmed that the Queen loaned it to the Duchess for tonight
