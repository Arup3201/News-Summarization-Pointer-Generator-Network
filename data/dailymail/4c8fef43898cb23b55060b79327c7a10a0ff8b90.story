An Illinois man has been found guilty of beating to death his girlfriend’s 3-year-old son after the toddler uttered a swear word while playing video game Mortal Kombat.

A judge Tuesday convicted Thomas Albea, of Waukegan, of first-degree murder in the 2011 killing of X’Zavion Charleston.

During Albea's two-day bench trial, the prosecution presented in court the defendant’s videotaped confession, in which the 22-year-old admitted to striking the little boy 'four of five times,’ although a coroner has concluded that the child likely suffered no fewer than seven blows.

Cruel punishment: Prosecutors said Albea repeatedly struck the toddler in the abdomen after X'Zavion uttered a swear word while playing the video game Mortal Kombat 

The incident took place at around 11pm on September 14, 2011, while Albea, then 18 years old, was looking after his girlfriend’s son in the 1700 block of McAree Road.

Prosecutors said little X'Zavion was playing the violent fighting game Mortal Kombat while waiting for his dinner when he used an unspecified expletive, followed by the words, 'he got me,' reported Chicago Tribune.

Albea responded to the child's outburst by striking him in the abdomen.

The teen suspect initially told police that he hit X'Zavion only once, but he later admitted that he struck the toddler multiple times.

The boy was rushed to Children’s Memorial Hospital in Chicago, where he died the next day from what the Cook County Medical Examiner described in the autopsy report as 'catastrophic' injuries to his internal organs and abdomen.

Albea's then-girlfriend, Qa’Chelle Charleston, was upstairs at the time of her son's killing.

When she came down to feed her son and noticed that something was wrong with him, Albea lied to her that X'Zavion had fallen.

Albea's attorney, Gillian Gosch, argued during the trial that her client did not intend to kill or seriously hurt X'Zavion.

But Judge Mark Levitt rejected Gosch's argument and subsequent plea for a not guilty verdict, stating that the extent of the 3-year-old's injuries shows that the brutal attack was more than an act of recklessness, or an attempt to discipline the boy for his transgression.

Albea could face 20 to 60 years in prison when he is sentenced April 22.
