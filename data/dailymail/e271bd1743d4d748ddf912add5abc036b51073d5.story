From the boxing ring in Liverpool, to Nazi camps in Greece, Douglas 'Duggie' Pomford was the bare-fisted bruiser who scaled German strongholds and took them on face-to-face.

Having battled his way to success in the ring at home, 'Duggie' was hand-picked to join a special troop of elite fighters - and let loose on the enemy.

In one incident in 1944, the 24-year-old even catapulated himself into the bedroom of two senior Nazi militants as they changed into their pyjamas...and disposed of them with his bare hands.

Medals: His Military Medals for bravery have been uncovered and are going under the hammer for £50,000

Now, 70 years on from his perilous night raids, Sergeant Pomford's family has uncovered his Military Medals for bravery, which are going under the hammer for an estimated £50,000.

Duggie's rise to Special Commando was fast - and he narrowly escaped death on a number of occasions.

He had ploughed his way through opponents at
 home in Liverpool, and was almost ready to settle 
as a champion of the amateur boxing ring in 1940.

Little did he know, he had bigger fish to fry.

He had only been in the army for six 
months when he was handpicked to join the British Commandos and went on 
to become a founding member of the Special Boat Service.

In November 1941, he had been due to take part in the disastrous attempt to capture Field 
Marshall Erwin Rommel.

But
 the submarine he was on had to withdraw due to weather conditions and 
he missed the ill-fated raid, which ended in the capture of all but 
three of the 34 commandos involved.

After
 joining the crack Special Boat Section, Sgt Pomford was among 200 
soldiers stationed at their training base in Palestine from where they 
carried out a raid on three airfields in Nazi-occupied Crete.

Sgt Pomford’s unit then turned their attention to the islands of Kos and Leros which they cleared and established an airfield.

But
 the Nazis retaliated and reclaimed the islands, forcing the commandos 
to retreat to Turkey where they were arrested by neutral forces and 
later released.

Sgt Pomford was awarded the Military Medal for his bravery during the raids on the Greek islands.

A second Military Medal was awarded to Sgt Pomford for devastating attacks on Ios, Amorgos and Naxos in 1944 - including his bedroom attack on two Nazi officers.

It
 was the middle of the night and the Allies had just been forced back 
into Turkey, surrendering their airfield on the Mediterranean islands.

With
 victory still a distant fantasy, British commanders decided to deploy a
 team of elite fighters to take it on fro the inside - and Duggie was 
one of them.

Incredibly, the 
24-year-old set upon the enemy as they were changing into their pyjamas.

The two soldiers launched themselves at their attacker and tried to kill him with their bare hands.

But Duggie, or Sergeant Pomford, had not lost his skills honed in the ring back home and promptly dispatched of them.

In 1945 Sgt Pomford qualified as a paratrooper and took part in further operations in the Balkans before being demobilised in 1946.

On his return home Sgt Pomford became the foreman at the Port of Liverpool Stevedoring Company and was instrumental in settting up the famous Golden Gloves Amateur Boxing Club.

He died in 1969 aged 49.

His medal set, which also includes the 1939-45 Star, the Africa Star, the Italy Star and the War Medal 1939-45, is now being sold by his family.

It is tipped to fetch £50,000.

A spokesman for the family said: 'These medals are being sold because they have been in a biscuit tin for 60-odd years and have never been on display.

'The hope is that they will go to somebody who will understand and appreciate them.

'They are a part of history and they need to go to someone who can not only treasure them but also afford to insure them, which I can’t.

'It’s a way of keeping his legend alive and is much better than them staying in the biscuit tin.'

Pierce Noonan, from London auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, said: 'Pomford was a classic Special Forces hero.

'A pugnacious Liverpudlian, he developed his fighting skills in the boxing ring in his home city and then used them to lethal effect in raids on German forces in the Eastern Mediterranean.

'Even among the highly decorated founders of the Special Boat Section, he stood out as exceptionally brave and tenacious.'

The auction will take place on June 26 in London.
