The tuberculosis outbreak among cats in the Home Counties is at risk of spreading across the country and infecting more people, according to experts.

The warning came as the mother of the first documented victim said she would not dare to keep a pet again.

Claire Livings witnessed her daughter Jessica, 19, suffer for months with hallucinations, fevers and dramatic weight loss after contracting the potentially fatal disease from their kitten Onyx.

The 40-year-old hotel worker, who caught a dormant form of TB, said: ‘I still love cats. I don’t mind being around them and although what happened to us is very rare I can’t be sure it wouldn’t happen again.

'After what we went through last year I couldn’t risk it, but I don’t know how I will feel in the future.’

Jessica was forced to undergo emergency lung surgery. She and her mother – two of the first four recorded cat-to-human transmissions of bovine TB – are believed to have caught the disease from a wound on the kitten who later died.

It was revealed last night that five-month-old Onyx may have been infected at Falkland Veterinary Clinic in Newbury, Berkshire.

The centre’s clinical director Carl Gorman, who identified the outbreak, diagnosed nine cats with TB between January and March last year.

He said: ‘Onyx came in to us around January to be spayed … There is a chance that when he was castrated the wound was infected with the TB organism … it may have been because he was very young or the strain of TB is very aggressive.’

Seven of the nine infected cats had bite wounds thought to be from badgers. Six were put down or died but 18-month-old tabby Milhouse, who belonged to Dr Gorman, is missing.

The vet believes the outbreak started with a local herd of cows which contracted TB. It is argued the spread of the disease is accelerated by badgers and the Government is undertaking a cull.

But Robin Hargreaves, of the British Veterinary Association, said: ‘It is going to happen again. It’s low risk, but not no risk.’

Calling for vets to be vigilant, he warned that TB would persist in pets even if it was eradicated in cows because of a ‘high endemic problem’ in wildlife.

He added that all infected animals should be put down to reduce health risks to humans.
