Shrouded in five acres of sprawling fields, this country manor seems to be an isolated retreat cut off from the outside world.

But in reality, it is the commuting countryside-dweller's dream.

For at the foot of the rambling garden is a railway track - with a 'halt' to stop passing trains.

Idyllic: This five-bedroom stone manor in Snowdonia National Park, Wales, comes complete with a Victorian-era railway to the seaside village of Tywyn. It is set behind woodland garden but the house looks like the picture of isolation shrouded in five acres of fields. It takes in views from Cardigan Bay too as the plains remain untouched

Bonus: Would-be buyers of this £425,000 country manor are at least half a mile from the nearest train stations in either direction, but get this private Talyllyn Railway at the foot of the garden that has 42 trains pass through it every week at high season - 30 in the winter. But you'll have to flag them down as there's no platform

The five-bedroom stone house, now on the market for £425,000, is set in the heart of Snowdonia National Park in Wales - half a mile from the nearest train stations.

But with the Victorian-era Talyllyn Railway running across their land, would-be buyers need not worry about driving the distance.

A winding footpath from the house leads through woodland and a valley to the property's halt.

The 42 steam trains that pass by each 
week on a heritage railway line can be waved down by the owners - who 
can also request it to stop there when getting off.

Services run between the former slate mining town of Abergynolwyn to the seaside village of Tywyn.

The halt is called Tynllwyn-Hen - Old Tynllwyn in Welsh - which is named after the house that dates back to the 17th century and began life as a farm.

It was created around 1900 to serve the farm and is simply marked by a small signpost next to the railway track.

Quaint: Potential buyers will have sprawling views of the Welsh countryside from their homely room, where the current owners have lived since 1975

Fully equipped: It seems to have the best of everything, boasting privacy and transport, as well as a reception hall, kitchen and breakfast room, and conservatory

The house that now stands on the property was once two cottages that were made into one property in the 1970s.

It boasts a reception hall, a kitchen and breakfast room, conservatory, sitting room, drawing room and a utility room.

It also has a stone barn which has been converted into a studio, workshops, stables and stores.

The house is being sold by the family of Tim and Jill Winterton, who have owned it since 1975, through estate agents Strutt and Parker.

Daughter Shane Flutter, who grew up in the house with her brother and two sisters, said: 'It was the most magical place to enjoy a childhood.

'At the bottom of the fields in the valley is the railway and there is a small halt there.

'Any time people came to stay we would go down to the railway and jump on the train up to the Dolgogh waterfalls nearby or up to Abergynolwyn.

'It was just a case of flagging down passing trains as they approached the halt.

'Nowadays it is our children who have been enjoying the railway.

Historic: Originally a farm, the Victorian-era railway, Talyllyn Railway, was used by neighbouring farmers in the 1800s to get to the seaside town of Tywyn

Connected: Owners simply have to flag down trains to get to and from their retreat to busy towns - endless entertainment for the current owners' children

'The house means so much to our family but we have all moved away and it has become too much to look after.'

Malcolm Wood, secretary of the Railway Heritage Trust, said that halts were the forerunners to full-blown train stations and served rural communities.

He said: 'People would stand at the halt and hail approaching trains which would stop to pick them up.

'Likewise, if you were on the train you pre-warned the guard that you wanted to alight at a particular halt.

'Once very much a feature of Britain’s railways, some halts from the early 20th century still exist, and still operate on the request system.

'But they are not very common these days, and it is quite unusual to find a halt in such simple form adjacent to a private house.'

Belinda Hutchinson-Smith, from Strutt and Parker, said: 'This house has one of the most beautiful views imaginable embracing both the Cardigan Bay and the hills of Snowdonia.

'You can really feel its been a much loved family home and there is a wonderful feel of timelessness about it.

'There can be few houses which enjoy the novelty of its own private halt from where you can wave down the steam train which travels up and down the valley.'
