A quarter of patients who've had a heart attack or stroke will suffer from PTSD within a year

Nearly one in four patients who suffer a stroke or heart attack go on to experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a study has found.

Previously thought of as a condition which only affected soldiers or victims of traumatic events such as assualt, the research shows PTSD is much more far reaching.Â 

The findings suggest that nearly 300,000 survivors of strokes or heart attacks will develop symptoms of PTSD as a result of their health scare every year in the U.S. alone.

The research, carried out by Columbia University Medical Center, also found suffering from PTSD also doubles a patient's chance of future heart attack and of death within three years.

Donald Edmondson, assistant professor of behavioral medicine at CUMC, said: 'PTSD is common among heart attack survivors and it contributes to a doubled risk of a future cardiac event or of dying within one to three years.

'Our current results show that PTSD in stroke and TIA [heart attack] survivors may increase their risk for recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events.

'Given that each event is life-threatening and that strokes/TIAs add hundreds of millions of dollars to annual health expenditures, these findings are important to both the long-term survival and health costs of these patient populations.'

PTSD is an anxiety disorder caused by exposure to a traumatic event. Common symptoms include nightmares, avoidance of reminders of the event, and elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Chronic PTSD is when these symptoms persist for three months or longer.

Researchers at CUMC believe this study, on 1,138 stroke or heart attack survivors, is the first time research has been carried out into PTSD caused by strokes or heart attacks.

Findings: PTSD has previously been primarily associated with soldiers or victims of traumatic events but new research by Columbia University Medical Centre has highlighted that many victims of stroke go on to suffer the disorder

According to data from the American Stroke Association, nearly 795,000 suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the U.S. every year with a further 500,000 suffering a heart attack.

The study shows that around 23 per cent of sufferers will go on to develop PTSD symptoms within a year of their stroke or heart attack, with one in nine suffering chronic PTSD more than a year on.

Ian Kronish, assistant professor of medicine at CUMC, said: 'PTSD is not just a disorder of combat veterans and sexual assault survivors, but strongly affects survivors of stroke and other potentially traumatic acute cardiovascular events as well.

'PTSD and other psychological disorders in stroke and TIA patients appear to be an under-recognized and undertreated problem.

'Surviving a life-threatening health scare can have a debilitating psychological impact, and health care providers should make it a priority to screen for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among these patient populations.'

The study was published in the online edition of PLOS ONE.
