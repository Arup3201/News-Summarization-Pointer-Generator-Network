Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon has praised the 'exceptional talents' coming through the youth system at White Hart Lane.

The England international foresees a bright future for the club and predicts several youth team players could soon be be breaking through to the senior side.

Speaking to the club's official website, Lennon said: 'You only have to look at the lads who have come through like Andros [Townsend], Harry Kane, Tom Carroll, Nabil [Bentaleb], Jake Livermore, Ryan Mason – they've all come through the system during my time here.

'The young lads here now have trained with us a few times and I've been really impressed with them, they are all brilliant technically.

'If they can keep their feet on the ground and continue to work as hard as they are doing then I think you'll see a number of great home-grown players coming through soon.

'The main thing is to work hard every day and listen to the people around them, the coaches, senior players and try to take in as much information as they can and try to take that onto the pitch.

'It looks bright for the club. There are some exceptional talents here.'

Former Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe could make a return to the Premier League from FC Toronto

Meanwhile, the boss of the Major League Soccer franchise refused to rule out the prospect of a January move for former Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe.

Defoe was linked with a return to the Premier League this summer, just a few months after joining Toronto, but is committed to helping the team reach the MLS play-offs. 

Tim Leiweke, president and chief executive of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, Toronto's parent company, said: 'Making the play-offs would be a huge step forward (for Toronto). Jermain now gets that and is totally focused on that.

'As to what happens during the next transfer window, we've all agreed we'll put it on hold and talk about that in December.'
