Juventus continue to hold interest in Patrice Evra despite the Frenchman signing a new contract.

The 33-year-old is wanted by Louis van Gaal but knows he won't play regularly following the £28million purchase of Luke Shaw from Southampton.

United are being offered numerous stars at the moment but they are wary of being used as a stalking horse for other deals.

Real Madrid are asking if they have interest in Angel di Maria with agent Jorge Mendes ready to move the Argentine winger to make way for his other client James Rodriguez from Monaco.

Di Maria has also been discussed in Madrid's talks involving Radamel Falcao from Monaco. 

Carlo Ancelotti would prefer Di Maria to stay and he is a poular figure in the dressing room. However, Madrid need to balance the books and know there is better cash available in England from United, Chelsea and Arsenal for Di Maria and Germany midfielder Sami Khedira.

Lovren set to leave Southampton

Dejan Lovren is not expected at Southampton for pre-season training after declaring his intent to leave. The Croatian is being pursued by Liverpool who have had two offers rejected so far. 

The 24-year-old believes an agreed figure has already been bid by Liverpool but Southampton have stalled on a deal while they seek replacements.

Italian striker Dani Osvaldo did not turn up for training after providing a note citing medical reasons. He is hoping for revived interest from Inter Milan or Valencia.

Southampton hope to finalise Graziano Pelle's move from Feyenoord for around £6.5million.

Bacca interesting Newcastle boss Pardew

Newcastle are looking to Spain for their next signing with Sevilla's Carlos Bacca among their targets.

Manager Alan Pardew has received glowing reports on the Colombia striker who was voted the best La Liga signing of 2013-14 by Spanish newspaper Marca.

Bacca signed from Club Brugge for £5m and Sevilla promptly inserted a buy-out clause of £24m. He went on to score 21 goals in 50 games last season and impressed with his workrate as well as finishing.

Injury blow: Colombia were hoping to use Carlos Bacca (left) more at the World Cup but for a thigh strain

Everton, Barcelona and Juventus scouts have all watched him this season and he would have played a more significant role in Colombia's impressive World Cup campaign but for a thigh strain.

Newcastle want four more players, depending on sales, following the purchase of Siem de Jong and two strikers are priorities.

Alexandre Lacazette of Lyon remains another possibility while a move for Remy Cabella of Montpellier is not dead.

Arsenal have made an approach for Mathieu Debuchy but are short of Newcastle's £12m valuation.

Taylor to swap West Ham for Burnley

West Ham midfielder Matt Taylor will sign for Burnley on Thursday on a two-year deal.

The 32-year-old was out of contract at Upton Park and despite an initial offer of a new deal failed to agree terms. He will have a medical ahead of signing for Sean Dyche.

Burnley signed Matt Gilks and have held talks with Steven Reid, another free agent after he left West Brom, over a two year contract.

Burnley have also had a £5m bid for Watford striker Troy Deeney rejected but will try again. Burnley face competition from West Brom, Swansea, Aston Villa and Norwich but Deeney knows Dyche from his time at Watford and Burnley hope that will help - if they come up with the right money.

West Ham have made offers for Dundee United's Andrew Robertson and Norwich's Martin Olsson but held talks yesterday again over a possible deal for Nice left-back Timothee Kolodziejczak.

Zenit target Spurs midfielder Sandro

Zenit St Petersburg are keen on Tottenham midfielder Sandro. The Brazilian is favoured by Andre Villas-Boas who knows the player well from his tenure at White Hart Lane. 

Napoli have shown an interest but have been put of by Tottenham's valuation. Zenit, though, do have more cash to spend and may match Daniel Levy's £20m price tag. 

Liverpool midfielder Lucas is another option for Napoli whose priority was Maxime Gonalons of Lyon.

Tottenham will not be pursuing a deal for Esteban Cambiasso. The 33-year-old Argentina international was offered to Mauricio Pochettino and Franco Baldini but there is no interest as they look for younger players.

Cambiasso may now look at options in Spain.

Robert Earnshaw is considering an offer to play for ambitious Newport. The much-travelled 33-year-old is the only player to score a hat-trick in all divisions of the English Football League and is a free agent after leaving Blackpool at the end of the season. The League Two side are managed by former Tottenham defender Justin Edinburgh who recognises Earnshaw still has the ability to score goals.

Sunderland are willing to let Danny Graham leave for £1m. The 28-year-old cost Sunderland £5m when he joined from Swansea City 18 months ago when Martin O’Neill was in charge on but Graham was quickly discarded after failing to score in 13 games. He spent the whole of last season out on loan, at Hull City then Middlesbrough and scored six goals in 18 games. Middlesbrough remain interested.

Sunderland, meanwhile, are among clubs to have been offered the chance to sign France international Mathieu Valbuena. The 29-year-old is performing well at the World Cup but Marseille are willing to sell for around £8m. West Ham have also begun to explore the possibility but are wary Valbuena will want to join one of Europe's elite clubs should he depart France.

Wrexham are discussing the possibility of signing Lewis Nuttall from Burnley, Liam Walsh of Swindon and former Leeds United youth captain Corey Roper as part of the pioneering scholarship scheme they have up and running with Glyndwr University.

Ipswich defender Aaron Cresswell is having a medical at West Ham ahead of a proposed move to the Premier League club, with Sam Allardyce quickly moving on to new targets after seeing an offer for Norwich's Martin Olsson rejected.

West Bromwich Albion had failed to offer the desired amount to Ipswich who have been chasing £3m for the 24-year-old.
