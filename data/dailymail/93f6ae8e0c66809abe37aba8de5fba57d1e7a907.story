Britain could be stripped of even more powers under plans to create a new super-powerful EU president who would not be directly elected by voters.

A group of Eurocrats have secretly devised a scheme to merge the jobs currently done by Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, and Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission.

The new Europe chief would be in charge of both the administrative and political arms of the EU and have sweeping control over the entire union.

The UK has been excluded from the covert discussions, which were were uncovered by Independent Labour peer Lord Stoddart of Swindon.

Critics fear David Cameron is doing nothing to prevent the ominous plans, according to the Daily Express.

'This is a plot by people who want to abolish nation states and create a United States of Europe,' said Lord Stoddart.

'The whole thing is barmy. These people are determined to achieve their final objective.

'The only hope for Britain is to leave the EU and become an independent nation.'

Tory backbench MP Douglas Carswell said: 
'It doesn’t matter how you arrange the offices of these technocrats, 
they are useless at arranging our lives for us and they are not elected 
so they have no legitimacy.'

Former Portuguese premier Mr Barroso, was
 elected to his post by members of the European Union and is said to 
resent Belgian Mr Van Rompuy, who was chosen by the heads of ­government
 of EU member states.

Lord Stoddart warned that 
informal discussions within the EU have a habit of rapidly being 
transferred into formal proposals.

He confirmed the existence of 
the plot in the House of Lords by asking Foreign Office ministers to reveal what they knew about the 
merger discussions.

Lord Howell pointed out that the holder of this new office 
would be both Europe’s political and administrative leader, giving them even more powers than the U.S. president.

A Foreign Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: 'As has been widely reported for a couple of months, the idea of merging the Commission and European Council presidencies has been informally discussed before. We believe that any proposal to merge these two offices would need treaty change and the UK Government would not agree to such a proposal.

'It would also mean a centralisation of power in Brussels that would further weaken the EU’s legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens.'
