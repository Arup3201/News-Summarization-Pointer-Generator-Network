The Australian activist who disrupted last year’s Boat Race has won his battle against deportation after claiming his fellow countrymen would be racist to his wife who is of Indian descent.

Trenton Oldfield, 37, had his application to remain in the country refused earlier this year after the Home Office deemed his presence ‘undesirable’ following the incident.

But the protester, who was sentenced to six months in prison as a result of his publicity stunt, won on appeal after arguing that Australians were ‘passive aggressive’ racists.

He said that if he was forced to return to his home country, he would not be able to bring his wife Deepa Naik, who is of Indian descent, or his daughter.

He said: ‘Australia to Deepa... is a particularly racist country. There are particularly racist attacks on people of Indian descent.’

Mr Oldfield went on to say while most of it was ‘water cooler’ or unintentional racism, some Indians in Australia had been burned and physically assaulted.

‘I don’t think I could put either Deepa or my child through that,’ he said.

Oldfield disrupted the annual Oxford v Cambridge competition in April last year as a protest against what he described as ‘entrenched elitism’.

He had his application for a spousal visa refused earlier this year but he won on appeal yesterday at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in Islington, north London.

The protester, who has a five-month-old daughter, told judge Kevin Moore that he was inspired to disrupt the race after caring for his British wife’s father, who was suffering from cancer.

‘I think I was vulnerable in terms of realising how short life can be,’ he sobbed to the court.

‘I saw poverty and I saw the laws the government were passing that were going to make life substantially harder.

‘I think I was very emotional. When you go around London, you can see the pockets of deprivation that still exist.’

Outside court, Oldfield told reporters: ‘I’m delighted to be able to get back to my work and spend time with my family.’

He thanked his supporters, but said the public interest surrounding the case should highlight the problems surrounding deportation threats.

‘What I would like to say is this happens every single day in this building to all sorts of people and we need to start paying attention to these people who are experiencing what can be quite a violent experience of having the state come down on you,’ he said.

‘Deportation is an old ideal and it’s from another time - 1,000 years ago.

‘We need to rethink that and the media’s attention needs to be on not me anymore, but the people who are going in and out of this building and that is where the real issues are.’

Protest: Trenton Oldfield, accompanied by his wife, Deepa Naik and their child, appeared at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in central London today for a hearing regarding extradition back to Australia.

Oldfield said his wife had never been to Australia and had no interest in doing so.

‘Meeting Deepa was like meeting the person you’d always been searching for,’ he said. ‘We’re muses for each other, but also our strongest critics.

‘Everything we do is together. Every single part of our life is entangled together.’

Oldfield said he worked with his wife in not-for-profit organisations and various charities.

‘I fell in love with London within two hours of arriving,’ he said. ‘There was room for people like me... who were interested in justice, interested in fairness.’

Oldfield said he regretted many aspects of his protest, particularly the impact it had on his family and he would not be repeating his actions.

Miss Naik, who had to leave the hearing at times to comfort the couple’s crying daughter, later told the tribunal that he wanted to act against inequality.

‘When Trenton swam in the Thames, he had no idea at the time the potential consequence would be a prison sentence,’ she said.

‘It is the first and only time Trenton has done a protest like this.’

Miss Naik said she did not want to think what would happen if he was deported.

‘It’s something I don’t want to fathom,’ she said. ‘It would mean the destruction of everything we’ve ever worked on.’

Miss Naik said she did not want to go to Australia because she did not have any family or support networks there.

She added that Australia’s strict immigration laws would mean there would be a forced separation between Oldfield and his family.

Outside court, Oldfield told reporters: 'I'm delighted to be able to get back to my work and spend time with my family'

The judge heard from an Oxford professor who commended Oldfield’s work and the court was handed a petition against his deportation signed by 265 Cambridge and Oxford staff and students.

Darren Morley, representing the Home Office, said although the protester had some desirable characteristics, he still broke the law.

‘The appellant was not trying to live within the laws of a country that welcomed him and helped him build a life here,’ he said.

But Stephanie Harrison QC, for Oldfield, argued her client’s good work in the community outweighed the incident and caused only minimal disruption to the race.

‘He has been trying... to make a difference to people’s lives who are on the rough end of society,’ she said.

‘He should not be doubly punished.’

Judge Moore agreed, saying he thought Mr Oldfield was of good character.

‘It would be my intention to allow the appeal,’ he said to sighs of relief from Mr Oldfield and his supporters.

A Home Office spokesperson said: ‘Those who come to the UK must abide by our laws. We refused this individual leave to remain because we do not believe his presence in this country is conducive to the public good.

‘As we are awaiting the Judge’s written determination in this case, it would not be appropriate to comment further.’
