Kobe Bryant returned Sunday from a devastating injury to the Lakers lineup after an eight month absence.

Mr Bryant almost had a double-double, with nine points and eight rebounds in his season debut for the Lakers, but the team fell 106-94 to the lowly Toronto Raptors.

He began his 18th NBA season by going 2 for 9 with four assists and eight turnovers in 28 minutes.

The sure-fire hall-of-famer hadn't played since tearing his Achilles tendon in April and underwent months of rehabilitation to return for Los Angeles' 20th game this season.

Adoring fans cheered Kobe's every move 
and forgave every misstep, but Bryant couldn't rally the Lakers late 
despite another huge game by Los Angeles' reserves.

The 35-year-old perennial all-star hadn't played 
since getting hurt in a home game against Golden State on April 12, 
making two free throws on a torn Achilles tendon before limping to the 
Staples Center locker room.

He had immediate surgery, vowing to return 
close to full strength - and after working his way back into practices 
with the Lakers in the last few weeks, he pronounced himself ready.

The
building had the buzz of a playoff game before the opening tip, with 
most fans in their seats with cameras trained on Bryant during opening 
warmups.

The building erupted in loud applause at every mention of Kobe,
who was introduced last in the starting lineup to the thunderous 
strains of 'The Imperial March' - Darth Vader's theme from 'Star Wars.'

The
crowd roared again the first time Mr Bryant touched the ball, and he found
Robert Sacre underneath the hoop for an assist on Los Angeles' first 
possession.

With his wife, Vanessa, and two daughters sitting courtside, he hit a free throw for his first point in the second quarter, 
followed shortly by an 8-foot, double-pump, left-handed bank shot for 
his first field goal.

The Lakers never led, and Toronto improbably snapped its five-game losing streak despite playing without forward Rudy Gay, who is expected to be traded to Sacramento on Monday as the centerpiece of an apparent seven-player deal.

Kyle Lowry had 23 points and eight assists, and DeMar DeRozan added 10 of his 26 points in the final 4:35 of the Raptors' first road win over the Lakers in 11 tries since Dec. 28, 2001.

Nick Young scored 19 points for the Lakers, who went 10-9 without Mr Bryant this season, forging a winning record without the five-time NBA champion and with little help from fellow injured former MVP point guard Steve Nash.

Xavier Henry scored 17 points off the bench, and Jodie Meeks added 14 for the Lakers.

The Raptors had 11 players available after holding out Mr Gay, center Aaron Gray and forward Quincy Acy, all set to head to the Kings in exchange for Greivis Vasquez, Patrick Patterson, John Salmons and Chuck Hayes.

That turned out to be plenty, thanks to two Los Angeles natives. Johnson, who attended nearby Westchester High School, went 14 for 17 and surpassed his previous career high early in the third quarter. Mr Johnson didn't take a shot in the fourth, but USC product Mr DeRozan and Mr Lowry held off the Lakers.

Mr Bryant added a signature 22-foot face-up jumper later in the period, but also showed clear signs of rust and unfamiliarity with his new teammates.
