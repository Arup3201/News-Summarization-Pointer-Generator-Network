Love moves in mysterious ways, and that's certainly the case for 81-year-old Cynthia Riggs.

The divorced author from Martha's Vineyard became the central character in her own mystery after receiving a love letter written in code in the mail.

'I'm always looking for wonderful mysteries and this seemed to be one,' Ms Riggs said, adding that the only details the code came with was a set of co-ordinates.

Mystery: Cynthia Riggs unexpectedly received a coded letter, with no details other than a set of co-ordinates

Happily ever after: The code led to a reunion for Cynthia Riggs and Howard Attebery, who married last week

It was a mystery that took the author 
back 60 years, to when she worked at a San Diego marine laboratory with a
 young man named Howard Attebery.

When Ms Riggs tracked Dr Attebery down in California he admitted to sending the note. In a final twist to the story, Dr Attebery confessed his love for Ms Riggs and the couple married last weekend.

Although they never dated when they worked together, the pair used to pass coded messages to each other at the laboratory, using a simple formula where A is substituted for B and so on.

Ms Riggs said the notes were just office banter, adding: 'I would say something like, "Did you see that Don found a copepod in his sample?".'

She told CBS: 'I liked him a lot but I didn't see any romantic interest in it'.

Dr Attebery however, adored his co-worker and kept all of the notes she passed him. Because he was sure Ms Riggs did not feel the same way, he never asked her out - until he was 90 years old.

The co-workers both went on to marry other people. After the death of his wife, Dr Attebery stayed single for a long time, before finally plucking up the courage to track down Ms Riggs.

And, after years of not knowing how to tell her how he felt, Dr Attebery's coded message read: 'I have never stopped loving you'.

The pair exchanged letters for about a year before meeting and, when they were finally reunited in California, he proposed within an hour.

'You know, love is a great place to spend the rest of your life,' he said.

While the couple were writing to each other they realized that despite their time apart they had plenty in common, including the heartbreak of losing a child.

When Dr Attebery sent her a photograph 
he had taken in Sedona, Arizona. Ms Riggs sent back a poem written by her 
late daughter, Mary, called Meeting My Father in Sedona.

Dr Attebery wrote back to say his son
 had died 'at the same time your daughter died and at the same age. It 
was a moment right away,' Ms Riggs told the Vineyard Gazette.

Ms Riggs, who comes from a family that has produced generations of Martha's Vineyard sea captains, was also married and has five children.

She divorced after 25 years, and said her abusive husband stalked her for several years afterwards, before finally taking his own life.

'After that,' she said, 'I said never, never, never again. And then this appears out of nowhere. It is just plain magical.'

The author of crime books set in her home town added: 'Life is just amazing. Donâ€™t give up hope. This is not what I expected at all.'

'Really, how much time do we have? But you know, it really makes that amount of time precious.'

In March, Dr Attebery and his son Mark, who teaches in New York, packed up his belongings in San Diego and headed to Martha's Vineyard where the couple had a commitment ceremony, according to the Vineyard Gazette.

Their wedding was held in West Tisbury Congregational Church on Saturday last week.
