Stoke City winger Brek Shea has joined Birmingham City on a three-month emergency loan.

The 24-year-old USA international joins with no recall option in place for a deal that will run up to and including Saturday December 13.

Manager Lee Clark moved for the American having seen his squad hit with several injuries in recent weeks, notably Lee Novak (knee), Denny Johnstone (thigh) and Olly Lee (hamstring).

Clark said: ‘I’ve been chasing Brek for a while and actually wanted to sign him permanently at the start of the season. 

'He impressed me when he played for Barnsley here at St Andrew’s on New Year’s Day and, given our recent injuries, it made sense to make this loan move, importantly with no recall clause being something that I have stressed all along.’

Shea has been looking for a new club after growing frustrated at Stoke. He joined from MLS side FC Dallas in January 2013 and has made five first-team appearances.
