Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch’s eldest daughter and her husband have purchased a Sydney mansion for $10.65 million from an Australian rare earth mining magnate.

Prue and Alasdair MacLeod, who own retail businesses on the affluent Woollahra village strip, bought the Queen Street property from Lynas Corporation chairman Nick Curtis and wife Angela.

The couple, who have been together for 25 years, sold their home in Vaucluse in 2012 and have been renting in the Woollahra area ever since.

The lavish property was marketed at close to $12 million in February but was then adjusted to $10 million.

Property Observer speculated it sold for around $10.5 million in the June sale based on what was being told to other prospective buyers, but the marginally higher official figure was revealed this week.

The 961 square metre site was last bought from 2SM radio broadcaster John Laws and wife Caroline for $7.7 million in 2004.

Laws had purchased the property in 1981 for just $264,000 and then commissioned a two-storey house, with separate staff quarters and a garage to house six cars behind the high fence.

The massive block is also home to a separate two bedroom cottage at the property which was marketed as ‘a blue ribbon retreat with comfort and convenience’.

In 2010, the MacLeod's discretionary investment trust Wyelba Pty Ltd, spent $4.6 million on the then shop premises of Collette Dinnigan, now Zampatti

A year later, the couple also bought the then Howell and Howell antique premises at 84 Queens Street for $4.25 million, now with Anna Thomas as the tenant. The upper level is run as boutique serviced apartment for tourists.

Nick Curtis has been leading Lynas Corporation mining company since mid-2001 with a career spanning more than three decades in the resources and finance industries.

The record property sale in Woollahra was made in 2008 sale when engineer John Grill paid $16 million on Rush Street.
