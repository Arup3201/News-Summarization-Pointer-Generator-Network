Jack Wilshere must improve his performances or face being excluded from the Arsenal starting line-up according to Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher.

The Gunners midfielder played 69 minutes during Arsenal's opening day 2-1 win over Crystal Palace in the Premier League, at which point the midfielder was hauled off in favour of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain with Arsenal labouring at 1-1.

Oxlade-Chamberlain's introduction inspired the north London side late in the game, with Aaron Ramsey scoring in injury time to snatch three points.

And according to Sky pundit and Sportsmail columnist Redknapp, Ramsey's contribution, as well as Mikel Arteta's captaincy has made it difficult for Wilshere to justify his team selection with Mesut Ozil still to return for the Gunners.

'All the midfield players Arsenal have got cannot get into this team, Redknapp told Sky Sports following the win. 'You've got Wilshere, Ramsey and Arteta, who is captain so has to play, Ozil to come back and and Cazorla. I think Wilshere has got it all on to get into this team.

'If he plays again like he did today, he could be surplus and he's one of England's best midfielders. But I can't see him getting a game at the moment.

'Jack WIlshere's problem is Jack Wilshere. He's not performing. He's got to take games by the scruff of the neck like two years ago - there's no excuses anymore.

'It's nothing to do with smoking. I played with better players who smoked. I think he's competing with Ozil for a place because Ramsey will always score more goals.'

Redknapp's fellow Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher also admitted that Wilshere would struggle to get into the Arsenal team if Arsene Wenger had his full crop of midfielders to pick.

'If everyone is fit, Jack Wilshere doesn't get into the Arsenal team,' Carragher added on Sky Sports.

'Wilshere has a problem with Ramsey's form. What Ramsey has done in the last 12 months is what we expected Wilshere to do to become the main man for England. Now he's not in the England team and when Ozil comes back he won't be in the Arsenal team.'
