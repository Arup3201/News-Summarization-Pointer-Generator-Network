France's Socialist government today threatened to stop private companies paying their executives too much.

In a move which will be met with widespread anger in the corporate world, Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said 'we will have to legislate' if salaries and other benefits are too high.

Mr Moscovici was reacting to a decision by PSA Peugeot Citroen CEO Philippe Varin to finally turn down a £17.5m pension pot.

The loss-making car company wanted to reward Mr Varin with the vast sum, but changed its mind following an outcry from mainly left-wing critics. 

'It was a wise decision,' said Mr Moscovici. 'I've always said, and this is the government's position, that we first of all have to make sure that self -regulation works.

'If it does not, then we will have to legislate. What happened yesterday does not change that.'

Mr Moscovici is a key lieutenant of President Francois Hollande, who famously said 'I don't like the rich' during his election campaign last year.

He has since attempted to introduce a top rate of income tax of 75 per cent, leading to a number of high-profile entrepreneurs and celebrities moving abroad.

Cash-strapped company: Under Mr Varin's stewardship of Peugeot some 11,000 job losses were made and a pay freeze enforced sparking staff demonstrations outside the PSA Peugeot Citroen headquarters in Paris last year

Meanwhile, the French economy has gone into crisis, with unemployment and the cost of living spiralling. 

Opinion polls meanwhile indicate that Mr Hollande is by far the most unpopular president in the history of France and somebody very few people trust to run a major European country. 

Mr Hollande has backed the scuppering of the Peugeot boss's pension pot, saying it was 'a wise decision', adding: 'That is the least one can say.'

He was backed by other senior politicians, including Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg who said companies should not over pay.

Mr Montebourg said: 'There should be a bit more self-discipline among those awarding themselves obscene salaries and unacceptable perks. But all the evidence points to that not happening.'

Mr Montebourg said the government had been able to put pressure on Peugeot over Mr Varin's package because it receives support from the state.

Right idea: French president Francois Hollande (right) said it was a 'wise decision' and backed the scuppering of the Peugeot boss' pension pot, as has Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg (left)

'For private companies, if self-discipline does not work, the legislature is perfectly entitled to proceed to regulation,' said Montebourg. 

Mr Varin will retire as Peugeot chief next year, and has now completely waived his right to his proposed package, which would have provided an annual pension worth some 280,000 a year.

Under his stewardship, Peugeot has announced some 11,000 job losses, and implemented a pay freeze.
