Malky Mackay is the outstanding favourite for the Wigan Athletic job with an appointment expected to be made soon.

The former Cardiff manager has been out of the game since he was sacked from the South Wales club last Christmas and is currently under investigation by the FA after Sportsmail revealed details of offensive texts exchanged between the Scot and his former head of recruitment at Cardiff Iain Moody.

Now, however, Mackay looks set for a way back after positive dialogue with Wigan chairman and owner Dave Whelan.

Malky Mackay is the favourite to become the new manager of Wigan Athletic despite an ongoing investigation by the Football Association into offensive text messages exchanged with Iain Moody 

Whelan said: 'I believe he deserves a fair hearing.

'We’ve had over 20 applications and started interviews on Tuesday. Hopefully we can make an appointment before the game this weekend against Middlesbrough.

'It’s an important job and I don’t like to mess around when I think I’ve got the right person.

'All the fans in Wigan, they all have total trust in me. Because I have one thing in my heart, that is Wigan Athletic. So they have trust in me and I would say to them all, you can trust me on this one. I have investigated every single aspect I can, I think Malky has been so unlucky.

'He has done a little bit wrong and has apologised for it. But to all fans, I want them to trust me. This gentleman is in my opinion exactly the man we are looking for. It is awful when you have to sack a manager, I had a terrible week last week, it hurt me a lot because he (Rosler) is such a nice guy.

'Football is a cruel game, I am sure Malky has found the little thing he did wrong, he has had plenty of stick for it.'

It is understood that Mackay and Whelan have already met and that the Wigan owner has been impressed by the 42-year-old’s plans for the club.

Mackay led Cardiff to a Carling Cup Final and from the Championship in to the Barclays Premier League during his time there. The Welsh club were never in the bottom three of the Premier League on his watch but went down once he was replaced at the start of the year by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

However, the former West Ham, Norwich and Celtic defender’s reputation hit rock bottom earlier this season when Sportsmail revealed texts between him and Moody contained racist, sexist and homophobic material.

He could still be charged by the FA – something that could cause a problem for Wigan – but it is thought the Association are struggling to discipline him under the terms of its own rules because the texts were deemed to be private.

Wigan captain Gary Caldwell has said he would back Mackay if appointed. 

He told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast on talkSPORT: 'Oh yeah. I know Malky from playing with him for Scotland and he’s a great guy, and a stand-up, honest man. I would have no problems working with him and no problems at all speaking to him.

'He’s done a great job since he’s been a manager. He’s had that experience of promotion with Cardiff and we want people at the club who know how to get success and get us back to where we want to be, and that’s the Premier League.'
