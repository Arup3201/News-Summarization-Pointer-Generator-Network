After their wonderful dismantling of Italy on Friday night, the players of Costa Rica stayed locked in their dressing room at Recife's Arena Pernambuco for 45 minutes. Victory had placed them in the second phase of the World Cup with a game to spare, but time still had to be found for prayer.

When they finally emerged, it was to the realisation that - for some - lives had changed forever. Back home, Jorge Luis Pinto's team will forever be known as the one that defeated a giant of world football and ensured that another - England - went home from World Cup 2014 early.

As their assistant coach the former Manchester City and Derby County striker Paulo Wanchope explained afterwards, many of these players will not fully understand what they have achieved until these finals are over.

Against England this week in Belo Horizonte, however, Wanchope does expect the team's star players to understand they are doing more than appearing in a relatively dead rubber at the World Cup.

They are auditioning for Barclays Premier League contracts.

'It's a big surprise for the world,' said Wanchope.

'I understand that. The reality is that nobody in the world expected Costa Rica to go through in this group. But now for sure I know a few of the players will want to do well against England and end up in the Premier League.This is their chance.

'We need to win that game to improve and we will enjoy it.

'I am sure the players want to impress the world by getting three points against a team like England.

'Sometimes
 when you are a player you don't realise what you have done. Today they 
feel happy but I don't think it will have sunk in yet quite what they 
have done here. 'We know we can go far. We have won against a world 
champion and we need to enjoy that.'

The
 remarkable thing about Costa Rica's success in Group D is that it has 
been fully deserved. These have not been fluke victories.

Against Uruguay - who they beat 3-1 - Pinto's team were second best for 45 minutes but swept the South Americans away after half-time. And against Italy they were never inferior in the heat of a Brazilian afternoon.

Team spirit: Surprise package Costa Rica could finish top of Group D

Confidence and belief runs through this 
team. Footage released after Friday's game shows the Costa Rica players -
 still aggrieved at not being awarded a penalty - squaring up to their 
Italian counterparts in the tunnel at half-time. That says a lot.

Young Joel Campbell, who will return to Arsenal in July after a loan spell at Olympiakos in Greece, summed up his teammates' approach to this tournament. If England are fearing a clean sweep of defeats this week then so they should.

'Football is not decided by what shirt you're wearing,' said the forward.

'With work and effort, you can win against anyone. We always believed we could do this. Of course we did. We were working for this moment and we have achieved.

'You never know what will happen in but we will keep working to do more.'

Shock: Costa Rica have won their two games against Uruguay and Italy at World Cup

Of those players who may catch Premier League attention, Campbell is one while goalkeeper Keylor Navas - currently with Levante in Spain - and FC Copenhagen midfielder Christian Bolanos have already stood out.

Campbell added: 'We are not thinking about who we get in the last 16. It does not matter to us. We were in a group with three champions of the world and we have shown that we can beat anyone.

'Today is unforgettable, we are part of history.

'Nobody would have put a single dollar on this team qualifying and there you go, we are very happy. It is the best day of my career, obviously. 'It is a problem for Italy if they did not pay attention to us. We trusted in what we were doing. This shows that, yes, you can do things if you work hard.'

A point against England on Tuesday would see Costa Rica top Group D and face a last-16 tie against the runner-up from the Group C teams: Colombia, Ivory Coast, Japan and Greece.
