Gordon Strachan has warned his Scotland players to prepare for a frantic British-style cup tie against the Republic of Ireland next month.

The Irish are unbeaten in Euro 2016 qualifying group D, a last-minute equaliser against struggling group favourites Germany removing some of the gloss from Scotland’s 2-2 draw in Poland.

In a game mined with sub plots, Strachan will go head to head with his Celtic predecessor Martin O’Neill at Parkhead on November 14. The presence of former Hoops stars Robbie Keane and Aiden McGeady in Irish shirts will add further spice to a game Strachan anticipates being explosive.

‘It’ll be a British cup tie type thing,’ predicted the Scotland boss. ‘Neither of us will be too interested in who wins the possession, put it that way.

‘There will be analysts telling us at half-time how many passes each team had. They’ll be like: “You’ve had 452 passes, you’re going great,” so the lads can keep passing.

‘But, no, Martin and I will feel the same about it. If players feel fatigued then have a day off.’

Asked if he relished the prospect of ‘locking horns’ with O’Neill, an iconic Celtic manager before his own successful Parkhead tenure, Strachan insisted: ‘We’ll not be locking horns, it’s the players who’re playing. Martin, like me, doesn’t over-think football.

‘We generally leave it to the players. We give them an idea of how to play and then let them get on with it.’

O’Neill’s assistant Roy Keane will also be in the technical area after turning down the Celtic manager’s job prior to Ronny Deila’s appointment.

In his recently published autobiography, the Irish icon claimed he joined the Scottish champions for a short spell as a player to ‘spite’ then manager Strachan after sensing he was indifferent to his arrival.

Keane also expressed irritation that Strachan allowed him to quit Celtic with a hip problem without offering up a fight for him to stay.

The Scotland boss has shared a television studio with Keane since the Parkhead episode and dismissed talk of added spice, insisting: ‘Not at all. It’s not even a second thought.

‘We have spoken about bits and bobs from our time at Celtic in the last three years with ITV. We just laugh at things.

‘You need to take into account how he wrote the book. He was sitting smiling when he told that story.

‘He laughs and so do the people round about him. There you go, it’s funny. He spoke to me about this before and I said: “I didn’t even know your hip was that bad.”’

Ireland’s equaliser against the world champions from John O’Shea provided another twist in a Euro 2016 qualifying group Strachan now regards as the hardest of them all.

‘If you look at the games so far you can say: “Where did that result come from?” That’s just the way it’s going to be.

‘Like I said the other day, you never know where the big one is going to be. Ireland are in good fettle, good form, but we’re the same.

‘Poland beat Germany and people talk about them being fantastic but we’re happy with how we’re playing and we showed it didn’t matter to us how they did on Saturday. We were next on and we felt good about it.’

Anticipating his own return to Celtic Park, Irish boss O’Neill said: ‘I will take a wee bit of time to think about it. Scotland are on a good run at the moment, they really are, they’re playing with plenty of confidence.

‘Gordon (Strachan) has them playing well and he’s been involved with them for a couple of seasons. I don’t know what their reaction to us getting a late goal against Germany is but it keeps our momentum going.’
