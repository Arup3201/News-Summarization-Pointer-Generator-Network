Facing court threat: Princess Cristina could be named as a suspect in a multimillion euro fraud case

The daughter of Spain's King Juan Carlos may be formally named as a suspect in a  multimillion fraud case, it was reported today.

Princess Cristina faces a possible indictment as her husband Inaki Urdangarin - the Duke of Palma - appeared in court  to be questioned about allegations of money-laundering.

Politicians are already calling for the abdication of her father after 37 years on the throne as anger grows over the corruption scandal engulfing the family.

The preliminary request by prosecutors to name the princess is likely to be made next week based on the evidence of Diego Torres, her husband's business partner.

Today on the Mediterranean island of in Palma de Mallorca, Urdangarin faced questions over allegations he and Torres funneled millions of euros to companies they controlled via a foundation on which Cristina served as a board member.

Around 170 police kept noisy protesters away from the courthouse as Urdangarin, who has not been charged with a crime, went into the building.

The investigating magistrate has ordered that he and Torres post a joint bond of €8.1m (£7m).

They are alleged to have done fraudulent deals with politicians in regional 
governments in Valencia and the Balearic Islands while running the not-for-profit Nóos Institute.

Part of the money was then laundered through offshore accounts, it was claimed. Both Urdangarin and Torres deny any wrongdoing.

Miguel Bernad, head of the far-right Clean Hands movement told the Guardian: 'If the princess sits in the dock, the blow to the monarchy's prestige will be huge.'

Clean Hands sent a prosecutor to join the case and has made earlier requests to magistrate José Castro to name Cristina as a suspect.

Now Bernad has claimed new evidence had cast serious doubts over her husband's statement that his wife had a 'hands-off ' relationship with the foundation.

Castro was set to question Urdangarin about three alleged offences 
against the Treasury, including corporate tax fraud related to his 
foundation and matters linked to his personal income tax returns.

The judge also intends to ask about alleged bank accounts in tax havens such as Andorra, Luxembourg and Switzerland.

Last week Torres revealed he had copies of dozens of emails that allegedly show that King Carlos tried to help his son-in-law land big contracts.

The Guardian reported that he has hundreds of emails stored, and has slowly been releasing them in as an attempt to force the royal family to help him avoid jail

The investigation into the alleged financial misdeeds has deeply embarrassed the monarchy in a country hard hit by a financial crisis and sky-high unemployment.

Urdangarin was given the title of Duke of Palma by the king, now 75, after his daughter married the Olympic-medal winning handball player in 1997.
