The England and Wales Cricket Board's National Performance Centre in Loughborough has been accredited by the International Cricket Council as a testing centre for illegal bowling actions.

The site is the fourth to be designated as such by the world governing body, following Cardiff Metropolitan University, the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane and Chennai's Sri Ramachandra University.

ICC testing protocols, which are used to determine whether reported bowlers comply with current guidelines, are provided to the four approved facilities to ensure uniformity in the process.

ECB acting chief executive Brian Havill, said: 'We are absolutely delighted that the National Cricket Performance Centre at Loughborough University has been accredited by the ICC as a testing centre for suspected illegal bowling actions.

'The ECB is committed to assisting the ICC in tackling the issue of illegal bowling actions in international cricket, and it is excellent news that the NCPC's facilities, equipment and expertise through Dr Mark King and Loughborough University can be utilised for this purpose.'
