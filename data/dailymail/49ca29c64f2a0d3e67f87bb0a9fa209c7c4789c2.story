A new cut of steak has been discovered hiding in an area of the cow that normally is used for chuck due to its fat, gristle and cartilage.

Meat expert, Tony Mata, found the so-called Vegas Strip in the shoulder area of the animal which butchers and chefs usually turn their nose up at.

He made his discovery after several years of trial and error and made his discovery by not following standard butchering procedures, such as following the seam on that particular piece of meat.

Chuck no more: A new cut of steak, the 'Vegas Strip', has been discovered hiding in an area of the cow that is normally used for chuck

A real pro: Tony Mata, left, who has a PhD in meat science, has taught butchers how to cut the steak in 25 seconds flat

'Pretty big deal': Rick Gresh, the executive chef at David Burke's Prime House in Chicago, said new cuts of steak are very important

Mata, who patented his procedure, has trained butchers to perform it in as little as 25 seconds, and they do so by trimming the bad from the good.

It is the first time in 10 years a new steak has been invented.

The last one was the flat-iron steak, which Mata also discovered.

Rick Gresh, the executive chef at David Burke's Prime House in Chicago, said new cuts of steak are very important.

‘I think it's a pretty huge deal,’ he told CBS News.

Mata, who has a PhD in meat science, says ‘there’s a diversity of eating experiences’ in the beef carcass.

Et, voila! They new Vegas Strip steak is already a popular choice, according to chef Gresh

‘I thought it was the coolest thing ever, and for me as a chef it really opened my eyes to look at all animals that way, and there's some great cuts out there that people don't know about,’ said Gresh.

And the steak is already popular. The chef said when the Vegas Strip is on the menu as a special it does ‘quite well’, claiming he’s sold as many as 400 in one day.

Other well-known cuts are the rib eye, tenderloin, the strip and the T-bone steak.
