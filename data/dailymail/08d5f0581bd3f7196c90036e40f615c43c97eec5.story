Nicole Dufault, 34, is charged with the sexual of three male students

A New Jersey high school teacher has been arrested on accusations of sexually assaulting three 15-year-old boys in her car and at the school where she taught.

Mother-of-two Nicole Dufault, 34, is charged with several counts of aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, NJ.com reported.

Prosecutors in Essex County say that Dufault, who taught language arts at Columbia High School for nine years, assaulted the boys during the regular academic year and summer school between 2013-2014.

The encounters allegedly took place in the teacher's car and the school's campus in Maplewood, New Jersey, and included oral sex and intercourse, authorities charge.

Dufault's two minor children have been removed from her custody.

'I don't understand how someone can't pick up the clues for something like that or how any one of those kids would not have said something before now,' parent Jennifer Berkeley told WABC.  'It's really surprising to me.'

'They do background checks on the teachers, so I don’t understand,' another Columbia HS parent told CBS New York.

Dufault was arrested at her home on Wedneday. One neighbor, who's known the teacher for six years, was shocked to hear about the allegations.

'Seemed like a, you know, just an average mom going to work,' Maureen Messina told CBS New York.

'Not only did she destroy her life and her children, but the boys who are involved as well,' the neighbor added.

Dufault is being held at the Essex County Jail in lieu of $500,000 bail.
