A city worker whose nose was bitten off during a nightclub attack has described the incident 'like something from Tyson v Holyfield'. 

Christopher Woolcott, 32, was at the Babble Club with friends when a row broke out with another group over a spilt drink.  

The Old Bailey heard that Johnathan Ball, 26, sank his teeth into Mr Woolcott’s face at the Babble Club in the City of London.

Johnathan Ball, 26, has been jailed for almost two years following the attack on February 24, 2013 

He bit through cartilage and flesh, tearing off the front part of Mr Woolcott's nose and leaving him bleeding and needing skin grafts to repair the damage. 

The attack has been described as one of 'real savagery.' 

On the night of February 24, 2013, Mr Woolcott was in the club with his friends near Ball and a group of his friends. 

At one stage during a night a drink was knocked over and a row broke out. Bouncers broke up the fight, but Ball broke free and took a running jump at Mr Woolcott, clamping his nose between his teeth. 

Mr Woolcott told the Evening Standard: 'It was only when I felt his teeth touching each other that I realised what he did. They just closed around the top of my nose, he bit it off and spat it out. It was like Mike Tyson on Evander Holyfield.' 

The incident took place at Babble Club cocktail bar in London last February when both men were with friends

Mr Woolcott required more than five hours of reconstructive surgery as doctors removed skin from behind his ear to rebuild his nose. 

Property broker, Mr Woolcott, who lives in south-east London said: 'One of the reasons I pursued this in court was to help the police and to stop this guy doing the same thing again. Biting is clearly his trademark as he has bitten two police officers in the past.

'Prison for 20 months isn't harsh, but he will be separated from his family and will have time to think about what he's done. Luckily, even with half my nose bitten off, I was able to find a nice girlfriend.'  

CCTV footage recorded on February 24 last year showed both Ball and Mr Woolcott were enjoying themselves with their own group of friends on the dance floor of the city club. 

But a scuffle broke out after a drink was spilt and Ball grabbed hold of his victim’s head, got him on the floor and sank his teeth into the front part of his nose.

Judge Charles Wide QC said the crime was ‘vicious and serious’ and told Ball: ‘You must have had part of his nose in your mouth after you bit him.’

Ball was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm after a retrial.

He was sentenced to 20 months in prison and an additional four weeks in jail after an earlier suspended sentence was activated.

In August 2006, Ball was convicted of assaulting two police officers, after biting both of them.

He also has a conviction for battery on another officer and numerous other drug-related offences, the court heard.

Mark Gadsden said the fight appeared to start after a drink was spilt and the situation then 'deteriorated rapidly.' 

He described the incident as an act of 'real savagery.' 

The pair had to be pulled apart by security guards.  

Ajay Malik, a security guard, was one of the workers who separated the men. 

‘I picked the other guy up and supported him and saw he was bleeding from the face,’ he said.

‘He was bleeding quite badly from the nose.

‘I took him downstairs for medical assistance.’

Mr Malik said when he went back upstairs to look for Ball he found him ‘hiding’ in a booth with his friends.

‘I found the guy, he was sweating and had marks on his face so I felt it was the right man,’ he added.

‘I asked him quite politely to come out because I wanted to speak to him but he wouldn’t.

‘I asked him once or twice but he wouldn’t come out.' 

Mr Malik said Ball also asked him if the police were coming.  

Ball initially told police that the attack was carried out by somebody else but later accepted he was responsible for the injury and claims he acted in self defence.

He told the court he bit off the man’s nose to defend himself when the trader tried to gouge his eye out.

‘I was like a sheep surrounded by wolves,’ sobbed Ball, who is 6ft 2 and weighs over 17 stone.

Mike Tyson was trying to rebuild his career when he secured a rematch against Evander Holyfield on June 28, 1997. 

During the third round the fight was stopped after Tyson bit through the top section of Holyfield's right ear. 

Tyson became the youngest ever heavyweight world champion in 1986, aged just 19.

In 1990 he was beaten by James 'Buster' Douglas in a major upset. 

This was followed by a conviction for rape in 1992 and a three year jail term. 

In 1996 Holyfield shocked Tyson, defeating him on November 9, defeating him in the 11th round. 

The following year, the pair had a much anticipated rematch.

Tyson bit Holyfield's left ear, early in Round 3. He then bit through Holyfield's right ear, spitting out amputated section on the canvas.
