Lynda Bellingham's grieving son revealed his heartbreak in a series of tribute tweets to his late mother last night.

Michael Peluso, 31, took to the social network yesterday after actress Lynda lost her battle with colon cancer on Sunday evening.

He posted the message: 'Oh mama miss u so much', followed by a small picture of two hands clasped together in prayer.

He also changed his profile picture to a beautiful photo of Lynda at the height of her fame.

After re-tweeting tributes to his mother, Michael, 31, tweeted last night: 'Oh mama, miss you so much'

Michael also posted a series of messages thanking well-wishers and praising his mother, who was best known for roles in the Oxo adverts and All Creatures Great and Small.

He wrote: 'In honour of mum! She always said...Tomo son is another day, onwards & upwards and don't let the buggers get u down Xxx'

Michael then re-tweeted a series of tributes by fellow TV stars Eamonn Holmes, Jennifer Ellison, Denise Welch, Zoë Wanamaker and Carol Vorderman.

Next to a picture of a broken heart, he wrote: 'Thank you everyone! Your love and compassion is overwhelming,'

Michael later added: 'With all the things goin on in the world the love u have all given myself and family and most importantly mum is just incredible. Thank youX'

When one of his followers commented on the outpouring of grief seen online, Michael replied: 'I'm very humbled X'

Michael and his brother Robbie are Lynda's sons from her second marriage, to Italian businessman Nunzio Peluso, which ended in divorce in 1996.

He followed his mother into acting, studying, like she did, at the Central School and Speech and Drama, and he even appeared alongside her on All Creatures Great and Small as a child.

He and his brother Robbie accompanied their mother and her third husband, Michael Pattemore, when she received her OBE earlier this year.

Lynda died aged 66 in the arms of her husband, Michael, in a London hospital on Sunday, just days after she announced her plans to end chemotherapy for the colon cancer which had spread to lungs and liver.

She said she wanted to take back control of her life and spare her family the pain of seeing the gruelling treatment take its toll on her.

She said two weeks ago: 'I want my husband and children to see me off happy, contented. So I put the chemotherapy in a box.

'In this box, I could stop the chemotherapy after Christmas - I'm determined to hang on until Christmas.

'If my quality of life fades after that, I want to be able to open the box, make a choice and stop the chemotherapy.'
