PSG forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic wants to rejoin former side Juventus according to an interview with his former Malmo coach Stefan Hansson in Italian newspaper Tuttosport.

The maverick forward has enjoyed an illustrious career playing for many top sides in Italy and Spain, and it is now believed the 32-year-old wants a return to Serie A with the Italian giants.

Ibrahimovic spent two years in Turin from 2004 to 2006, in truth enduring an indifferent spell in contrast to some of his other spells at the top sides.
