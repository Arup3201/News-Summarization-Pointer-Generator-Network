President Barack Obama and other top members of his administration have snubbed a historic rally in Paris today that brought together more than 40 world leaders from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and even Russia.

'France is our oldest ally,' Obama said during a speech Friday in Tennessee. 'I want the people of France to know that the United States stands with you today, stands with you tomorrow.'

But he wasn't standing in Paris as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas put aside their differences and linked arms.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov made the same unifying gesture in the march down the Place de la Concorde in defiance of the Islamist terror attacks that rocked the city last week.

According to an administration official, President Obama spent part of his Sunday afternoon watching a National Football League game on television. Both games were broadcast hours after the march.

Heads of state from every major European power, including British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, joined French President Francois Hollande. 

But the U.S.A. was M.I.A.

The Marche Republicaine saw numerous world leaders from Europe, Africa and the Middle East link arms and walk through the streets of Paris as a show of solidarity with France

WHERE DID HE GO? Attorney General Eric Holder was in Paris on Sunday for a security summit, but did not appear alongside world leaders when they joined an anti-terrorism march in the afternoon - instead he slipped away to appear on several US morning shows

Obama and Vice President Joe Biden remained in Washington, despite having no events on their public schedules Sunday. Secretary of State John Kerry was a world away in India, on a pre-planned trip.

Attorney General Eric Holder was in Paris for a terrorism summit held on the march's sidelines, but he slipped away and made appearances on four American morning television talk shows just as the incredible rally was starting.

The US was represented at the march only by Jane Hartley, the American ambassador to France who is unrecognizable to most Americans, let alone the rest of the world. 

A senior administration official was quick to point out, however, that 'Attorney General Holder – a Cabinet level official – is representing the United States at the security meetings in Paris today.'

'He is joined by the DHS Deputy Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas,' the official added in a statement to many news outlets.

'The United States is represented at the march by Ambassador Hartley.'

And 'as far as public signs of French solidarity from the U.S.,' the official concluded, 'don't forget several public statements from the president, his call to Hollande and a condolence stop to the French embassy.' 

Obama went to the French embassy in Washington, D.C. on Thurdsay to pay his respects, and signed a condolence book with the rallying cry 'Vive la France!'

Holder, Obama's longest-serving cabinet member, was pictured shaking hands with French officials after the event, but he slipped away – as did Mayorgas – before the march kicked off around 3:00 p.m.  

The attorney general appeared on four Sunday morning talk shows around the same time as the march, although it's unclear whether he spoke live from Paris or if his segments were pre-recorded.

The Department of Justice would not immediately comment on Holder's schedule with DailyMail.com, and a spokesperson for Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson similarly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

The White House press office also did not respond to a question seeking confirmation that the president was engrossed in the NFL playoffs on Sunday afternoon. 

Vice President Joe Biden often fills in for the president at events that require White House gravitas, but he was nowhere to be seen either, despite his own empty schedule.

Among those who did attend were: Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Union President Donald Tusk, Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas, Queen Rania and King Abdullah II of Jordan, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. 

EN MASSE: An estimated 1.3million people gathered at Republique Square in Paris, France on Sunday to demonstrate against the recent terrorist attack at the Charlie Hebdo offices which resulted in the death of more than a dozen people

Political opponents – and even some allies – were quick to criticize Obama for not showing up himself, or at least sending a senior administration official to represent him at the street-swelling rally.

An incensed former Speaker of the house Newt Gingrich vented on Twitter and told DailyMail.com that it was 'sad that 50 world leaders could show solidarity in Paris but President Obama refused to participate.'

'The cowardice continues,' Gingrich jabbed, referring to Republicans' refrain that he has shown a weak hand when dealing with terrorism overseas.

Politico reporter Ben White tweeted: 'Is it just me or does it feel like Obama should be at this big March in Paris?'

Fox News host Greta Van Susteren wrote: 'This is really embarrassing – WHERE IS PRESIDENT OBAMA? Why didn't he go?' 

Obama's absence was notable as dozens of nations' show of solidarity unfolded before a global audience – especially considering his public schedule was wide open. 

According to Buzzfeed, Holder left Paris after the summit to return to Washington. 

Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry was half a world away in India, preparing for the president's upcoming trip to the south Asian country in the coming weeks.

Protected: Security was an orchestrated effort, but that fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) joined shows how secure the dignitaries were. Pictured above with French President Francois Hollande (right) during a ceremony at the Grand Synagogue in Paris, following the march.

Mistake? Several political talking heads called President Obama's absence a 'mistake'. Above, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (center)  leaves the Elysee Palace to participate in the march 

CNN's Jake Tapper reported that security for the march was difficult, with 2,300 police officers and paramilitary forces deployed to Paris.

The foreign dignitaries were protected with police snipers, plainclothes cops and anti-terror officers. Streets were shut down and parking was restricted.

However, the attendance of controversial heads of state like Netanyahu appeared to show that the march was well secured. 

'I don't mean this as a criticism of the Obama administration,' Tapper said Sunday while reporting live from Paris, 'but just as an American I do wish that we were better represented in this beautiful procession of world leaders.'

'I'm a little disappointed, personally – this is me speaking personally, not as a representative of CNN, but as an American – that there isn't more of a display of unity here,' the host of 'The Lead' added.

CNN's Fareed Zakaria was one of the many who noticed President Obama's absence, and remarked that it was a mistake not to show up and support our 'deepest ideological ally.'

Zakaria said that it would have sent an important message to have an American face among the wold leaders.

Forbes columnist Stuart Anderson echoed Zakaria's statements, saying: 'By not attending the unity rally in Paris on Sunday, President Obama has missed an opportunity to show leadership, to demonstrate that Americans are as committed to fight against terrorism as anyone in the world. 

'And that America stands with its allies in a worldwide battle that, unfortunately, is likely to last many years.' 

The White House announced on Sunday that it would convene 'a Summit on Countering Violent Extremism' in February 'to highlight domestic and international efforts to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from radicalizing, recruiting, or inspiring individuals or groups in the United States and abroad to commit acts of violence.'

A statement from White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest made no specific mention of Islam, Islamist terrorism, or Muslims in general.
