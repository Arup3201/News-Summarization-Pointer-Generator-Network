The next Miss America won't hear a familiar refrain when she's crowned in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in September.

The song Miss America which starts with the words -  'There she is, Miss America' - will not be part of the pageant.

Miss American Organization Vice President Sharon Pearce tells The Press of Atlantic City that the tune, which was first played in 1955, is no longer included. She says no decision has been made on a final song.

The song was replaced by instrumental music at the 2013 pageant in January after Phylis Wayne, the widow of songwriter Bernie Wayne, filed a licensing lawsuit in federal court in California in 2012.

The complaint was dismissed in December following a confidential settlement.

This is not the first time the song will be absent from the pageant. In the 1980s Miss America didn't use the song following a contract dispute with Mr Wayne.

However, by popular demand, the song was brought back in 1985.

In a 1990 interview with The Press of Atlantic 
City, Mr Wayne told the paper that he wrote the song around 1955 in a New York City barbershop.

Though
initially the pageant's master of ceremonies rejected the tune, when 
Wayne played it again at a party for H. Pierson Mapes, the pageants 
sponsor, it was well received.

Originally 'Miss America' was heard in a 1955 Philco 
Television Playhouse movie, 'The Miss America Story,' starring 
then Miss America Lee Meriwether.

Sung later that year at the pageant by host Bert Parks, audiences favored the song and it has since become a tradition.

Other
songs written for the Miss America pageant include 'Look at Her,' 
'She’s Our Miss America' and'“Miss America You’re Beautiful,'  though in
her 2012 complaint Mrs Wayne claimed that her husband's song was the 
most widely known, reported The Press of Atlantic City.
