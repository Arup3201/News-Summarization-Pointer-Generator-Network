A woman's chance of going through life without having children has almost doubled over the past three decades, national statistics showed yesterday.

Nearly one in five of those who reached the end of their child-bearing years last year had no children, compared with just over one in ten of their mothers.

The breakdown by the Office for National Statistics showed that the most common family in Britain has two children – but among a generation of women born in the late 1960s, the next most likely outcome is that they have no children at all.

There is also a historic rise in the number of single-child families, so that 15 per cent of mothers born in 1967 have just one child.

The ONS pointed to a variety of reasons for growing childlessness and smaller families, including the decline of marriage, which has left many women without a stable home in which to have children.

Other factors leading to more childlessness are the greater costs of having children compared  to sticking with a job or career and the ‘greater social acceptability of the child-free lifestyle’, its report said.

The ONS also said a key reason is ‘the postponement of decisions about children until it may be biologically too late’. The evidence was gathered by the ONS in its  latest ‘cohort fertility’ figures – charts that show how many  children were born to women of selected ages.

Researchers compared the child-bearing history of those born in 1967, who reached 45 last year, with that of women from their mothers’ generation, born in 1940.

An average woman born in 1940 had 2.36 children, while an average member of her daughter’s generation had 1.91.

Those born in 1940 had an 11 per cent chance of childlessness, compared to 19 per cent for the 1967 generation.

Childlessness ran even higher for women born in 1965 and 1966, but high immigration in recent years has raised the overall numbers of mothers living in Britain. There have been high birth rates among women who have arrived in Britain since 1997. However, the ONS said that  smaller families ‘reflect women’s postponement of child-bearing to older ages, for reasons including increased participation in higher education’.

It also cited ‘the desire to establish a career, get on the housing ladder and ensure financial stability before starting a family’.

And the ONS also noted the impact of the declining popularity of marriage. Factors in delayed child-bearing include ‘delayed marriage and partnership formation’.

Independent analysts said that increasing childlessness is also a result of many couples having to rely on a double income to survive.

Family author and researcher Patricia Morgan said: ‘There is a downside to women’s advancement in the jobs market – all women have to be at work to meet the cost of housing and living, and their husband or partner doesn’t have an income good enough to rely on.

‘There is a tremendous loss if one of a couple leaves work, and there are no tax breaks to help them. Women just can’t afford children.

‘No political party will face up to the fact that most women want to look after their own children.

‘They don’t want to put them in daycare and they don’t want the father doing it.’

The statistic of 15 per cent of women born in 1967 having just one child is the highest rate since the generation born in 1935.

The spread of ‘little emperor’ families – named after the Chinese phrase for parents with a single spoiled child – reverses a decline in the proportion of one-child  families that dates from the Second World War.

One-child families were most common among women born in the early 1920s. ‘Around one fifth of women born in the 1920s had one child,’ the report said. ‘This may be because their marriage and child-bearing were delayed or disrupted by World War Two.’
