Sarah Isaac, 98, was dragged from her bed and robbed for the third time at her London home

A 98-year-old widow with dementia was dragged from her bed by burglars who ripped the wedding ring from her finger.

Sarah Isaac slept with her handbag under her pillow after two previous raids on her home of 60 years in Kidbrooke, south east London.

The attackers ransacked the room, stealing her handbag, purse, house keys and pension money.

They took other rings from Mrs Isaac's fingers including her dead husband's wedding band.

The intruders broke into her home and threw her onto her bedroom floor - leaving a wound on her arm - before looting her room while she watched helplessly on January 12.

Granddaughter Kate Henderson, 37, said: 'She was very distressed.

'My understanding is about three men gained access to her house through her back door, smashed a glass panel, went up to her bedroom, dragged her out of bed onto the floor, dragged the rings from her fingers, her bracelet, and left her lying there on the floor while they ransacked her room.

'She had to be taken to hospital - she had a gash in her arm where they had manhandled her off the bed.'

Former school dinner lady Mrs Isaac, nicknamed 'Cis' by her seven younger siblings, is now terrified of another attack and is staying with family.

The grandmother-of-two is most upset about the loss of her late husband-of-60-years Arthur Isaac's gold wedding ring.

Granddaughter 37-year-old Kate Henderson said attackers who manhandled elderly Mrs Isaac are 'lowest of the low'

Mrs Henderson, from Meopham, Kent, said: 'I think they have to be the lowest of the low, I can't understand what goes through somebody's head. To actually physically attack a vulnerable 98-year-old woman - I just don't understand it.

'We worry about her falling but it didn't occur to us that someone would target her.

'You feel sick. It is just devastating.'

DC Karl Buckwell from Greenwich police said: 'This particular incident is rather despicable and we are keen to hear from anyone who may have information that can assist with our investigation.'
