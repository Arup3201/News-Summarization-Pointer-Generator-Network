An international child pornography ring that produced and distributed sexually explicit images of babies and toddlers online has been cracked, the FBI said today.

Seven American men have been convicted and sentenced on various charges in the case, including three who were sentenced in federal court in Indianapolis on Wednesday, the U.S. attorney's office said.

Two more who pleaded guilty were awaiting sentencing.

Assistant U.S. Attorney General Lanny Breuer said: 'This operation uncovered a dangerous and depraved group of criminals who were devoted to trading sexually explicit images of children under the age of five.'

More than 20 suspects have been captured in nine states, and authorities are investigating yet more elsewhere in the U.S., as well as Sweden, Serbia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

First Assistant U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler said at an Indianapolis news conference that more than two dozen young children in Indiana, other states and other countries were abused in the production of the pornography.

'Children who far too often weren't old enough to comprehend the crimes committed against them,' Minkler said.

'Children who were raped in this state and were too young to ask for help.'

Operation Bulldog came to light in November 2010 with the arrest of David Bostic, 26. 

Federal, state and local investigators 
raided Bostic's home in Bloomington, Indiana, and found hundreds of 
images and videos on his computer of children between the ages of two 
months and four years engaged in sexual acts.

He was later convicted on 65 counts and sentenced to 315 years in prison.

Further investigation of Bostic's computer led investigators to others in the group.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve DeBrota said the members met though a website and traded videos and still images by email.

He said: 'When they found a like-minded individual with this particular attraction that was very powerful and helped them rationalize what they were doing – in their world – was OK.

'That ability to find a like-minded individual online that you couldn't find in the real world is a severe danger that comes with the Internet.'

Shawn Kuykendall, 32, of Summerville, South Carolina, was sentenced on Wednesday to 25 years, while 23-year-old Javahn Algere, of New Orleans, got 12 years and 21-year-old Richard Szulborski, of East Texas, Pennsylvania, was sentenced to a 15-year term.

Sentenced earlier were Bostic; Danny L Druck, 58, of Louisville, Kentucky, eight years; Chris Reid, 37, of Saginaw, Michigan, 35 years; Todd King, 41, of Crestline, California, eight years.

Nicholas King, 28, of Bellingham, Washington, and 22-year-old Jeremy Labrec, of Lubbock, Texas, have pleaded guilty and await sentencing.

Assistant attorney-general Breuer said: 'Child pornography rings pose a threat to children around the world and we will continue to aggressively investigate and prosecute those who participate in such groups.'

The case was a result of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide Department of Justice initiative to combat online child sexual exploitation and abuse.
