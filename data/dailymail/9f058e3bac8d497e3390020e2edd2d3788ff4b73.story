A suicidal college student who claimed she was attacked and raped was charged with staging the incident by posting ads on Craigslist, calling for men to beat her up in exchange for sex.

Morgan Triplett, 20, was charged with falsifying a police report after she told campus police at the University of California-Santa Cruz that she was on the grounds of the school looking for banana slugs in the forest when a stranger attacked and sexually assaulted her.

Now she is being criminally charged for lying about the circumstances of her attack, after police spent nearly two weeks investigating only to find out that she arranged for a man to beat her in exchange for sex.

Troubled: Morgan Triplett, 20, arranged to have a man meet her off Craigslist and beat her up in exchange for sex. Afterwards, she filed a false rape report to campus police

Facing punishment: Triplett said that a stranger attacked and assaulted her while she was looking for banana slugs- which are the UC-Santa Cruz mascot- in the redwood forest right near campus, which was a lie

Triplett, a UC-Santa Barbara student who was visiting UC-Santa Cruz for a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender conference at the time of the incident on February 17, had bruises on her head and torso when she reported the alleged rape to campus police.

Motive: Triplett is now facing up to six months in jail and investigators say she did it because she was 'suicidal'

The claims were given even more credence by the fact that there had been another attack near the campus just days earlier when a UC-Santa Cruz student was robbed and shot in the head while waiting for a bus.

According to the local Patch, Triplett posted two ads to Craigslist on February 15, the day prior to attending the UCSC conference.

The first ad called for someone to shoot her in the shoulder with a small caliber gun. The second wanted someone to punch, kick and bruise her.

Both situations would be done in exchange for sex, and she wrote 'no charges would be filed' against anyone who responded.

'The second ad, which ultimately was 
the one responded to, was seeking someone with a strong hand to inflict 
punches, bruises and kicks and compensation was to be provided with 
sex,' Ms Schonfeld said outside court.

'Several people responded to the ad.'

An unidentified man who responded to 
the second ad- and agreed to beat her in exchange for sex. She then 
called campus police and told them the story about wandering through the
 redwood forest near UC-Santa Cruz, looking for the banana slugs that 
serve as the school mascot.

'After an extensive investigation it 
became apparent that the majority of the information that Ms. Triplett 
gave the officers was not in fact true,' assistant district attorney 
Johanna Schonfield told local station KSBW.

Protection: Morgan Triplett was covered by her father when she left court in Santa Cruz on Friday after filing a not guilty plea for falsifying a police report

'They had sex and afterwards she used a
 cellphone screen reflection as a mirror to see if the injuries were bad
 enough. (Triplett) then directed him to hit her some more.'

At court on Friday, where Triplett 
entered a not guilty plea on the charge of falsifying a police report, 
Ms Schonfield said that the 20-year-old is depressed and seeking medical
 treatment for mental issues.

'She was suicidal and she wanted something to bring her back to reality,' Ms Schonfield said.

Triplett appeared at court on Friday alongside her father who tried to block cameras from taking her picture.

'Right now I just want this to settle down. Iâ€™m trying to move on with my life,' she said.

If
 found guilty, she may face up to six months in jail for falsifying a 
police report, as well as paying restitution for the dozens of manhours 
that police had to use in the ten days following her rape report before 
realizing it was a lie.

Her father said that the case is being mis-characterized, and though he did not elaborate on the details, he said that there are 'two sides to every story.'

'Morgan asked for some trouble, but she did not ask to be sexually assaulted,' Richard Triplett told the local newspaper, The Register Pajaronian.

'What we're dealing with is a very scared, very upset, very confused 20-year-old girl who has made some poor choices. This is the culmination of those choices.'
