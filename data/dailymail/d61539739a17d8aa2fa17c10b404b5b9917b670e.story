Jailed: Keith DeLarabond has been sentenced to two years in jail after admitting growing cannabis in his roof

A cannabis dealer who claimed he grew the drug to ease his back pain has been caught out after video emerged of him snowboarding on holiday.

Keith DelaraBond, 34, was jailed for two years when it emerged that his back injury was less serious than he'd pretended.

He had told a judge he took the drugs to control his sciatica following a back injury which left him in constant pain.

But Judge Trevor Faber rejected this after he watched a video of DelaraBond on a 14-week snowboarding course in the Canadian Rockies.

Another video was also played to the judge, which showed DelaraBond wheel-spinning a powerful 600cc motorbike.

DelaraBond was jailed for two years after he admitted growing 64 cannabis plants worth Â£21,500 at Warwick Crown Court on Tuesday.

The court heard he converted the roof space of his home near Leamington Spa in Warwickshire into a large cannabis factory between January 2009 and June last year.

The judge told him during sentencing: 'I am satisfied that you had been growing cannabis from before you went to Canada.

'You were growing large quantities on a regular basis, some for your own use but also to supply to others.

'You pleaded guilty, but you had little choice other than to plead guilty.'

DelaraBond was previously convicted for growing cannabis in 1999, and was given a 12-month prison sentence.

Speaking outside court his mother Maureen DelaraBond said: 'It's very sad but it was to be expected.

'He did something wrong and he admitted it. I am glad it was only two years, we thought it might be three. We all just have to move on from here.'
