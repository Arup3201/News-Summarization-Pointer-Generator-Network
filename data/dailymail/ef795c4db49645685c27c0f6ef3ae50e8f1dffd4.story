He has stared death in the face and come out the other side to tell his story - so swallowing an amputated human toe should be child's play.

The man who paid $500 for the privilege of gulping down a pickled toe was today named as Joshua Clark, who is believed to be a Hurricane Katrina survivor from New Orleans.

Reports emerged on Wednesday about the incident, which took place at the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City, Canada, on Saturday night.

Clark decided to take on the area's infamous Sourtoe Cocktail Challenge - wherein an amputated toe, which has been 
preserved and pickled, is dropped into a glass and for $5 the customer must 
drink the shot and have the toe touch their lips.

Saloon: The Downtown Hotel in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, is famous for its Sourtoe Cocktail - a 40-year tradition which has been done by more than 65,000 people

But Clark went one step further and 
drank the toe down with his whiskey, then threw $500 on the table - the 
fine imposed by the saloon should anyone swallow it.

The idea of the Sourtoe Cocktail started in September 1973, when riverboat captain Dick Stevenson found a severed big toe preserved in a pickle jar.

Captain Dick somehow got the idea of making a game with it and came up with the original rules for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends - Take a beer glass full of champagne, drop in the toe, tip the glass back…and the toe must touch the lips.

In September 1973, eight people participated in the first attempt; nearly four decades later, the Sourtoe Cocktail Club has an estimated 100,000-plus members.

Any liquor can be used in the cocktail, but the norm now is a shot of Yukon Jack whiskey. It costs just $5 and for that you sign a log book and get a certificate confirming you as a member of the Sourtoe Cocktail Club.

One rule must be adhered to however: 'You can drink it fast, you can drink it 
slow. But the lips have gotta touch the toe.'

It has been described by members of the club as a 'leathery piece of jerky with a toe nail attached'.

Clark was said to have been in Yukon Territory for the summer and had just got his rent deposit back.

A video of the incident emerged today on CBC Yukon
and shows the toe-curling moment the pinkie disappeared from the glass.

Clark's eyes widen as it goes down his throat before he washes it down with 
another drink.

He then stands up, raises his arms in
the air in triumph and says, 'I did it, it's down', before throwing 
$500 on the table to a visibly shocked Terry Lee, the 'Toe Captain' of 
the night.

Lee said the latest toe was 'mummified' with salt, and plonked into drinks for brave patrons about 30 to 40 times per night.

Speaking to The Star about what happened, he said: 'This guy popped it in his mouth, takes $500 out of his pocket and slams it on the table and starts walking away.

'I said, "Where’s the toe?" and he said, "I swallowed it". I was shocked.'

The fine has since been raised to $2,500.

Throughout the 40-year tradition, more than 100,000 people have joined the Sourtoe Cocktail club.

The Sour Toe started in September 1973 
when a local eccentric named Captain Dick Stevenson found a severed toe 
preserved in a jar.

He came up with the original rules 
for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends: take a 
beer glass full of champagne, drop in the toe, tip the glass back.

Since then a number have been swallowed, lost or 
destroyed - eight in total - but fortunately for the bar, they always manage to find 
someone to donate a new toe.

Lee said they have a backup toe but like to keep two at a time so are on the hunt looking for a new one.

He told CBC: 'We like to have two toes -
we switch them off once a week - and now we can't do that. We need 
toes. We're putting it out there, if you have a spare toe, hey we need 
one.'

Josh Clark remained in New Orleans during Hurricane
Katrina and the collapse of the levees. He refused to leave the city at the dangerous and devastating time and tape-recorded impressionistic 
interviews with fellow storm survivors.

From these interviews and his own diary entries, he penned Heart Like Water: Surviving Katrina and Life in its Disaster Zone, which was a 2007 finalist for the National Book Critics Circle award.

Gnarly: While it may sound unsanitary, the toes are pickled for months in medical alcohol and then packed in dry salts so pose no health risks to drinkers

Down in one: The famous tradition is mentioned in guide books and people have come from far and wide to become members of the Sourtoe Cocktail Club

Terry Lee said they are now looking for more toes: 'We like to have two toes - we switch them off once a week - and now we can't do that. We need toes. We're putting it out there, if you have a spare toe, hey we need one'

Captain Dick shows how it's done: The now-83-year-old says the Sourtoe Cocktail is his greatest and proudest achievement

The toe is believed to belong to Steve White, a chain-link fence installer in 
Whitehorse, who got his pinkie toe amputated in January 2000 after 
developing hammertoe.

He kept it in a jar in his freezer and donated it in April 2002.

Manager at the Downtown Hotel Dick Van Nostrand told the Wall Street Journal last year: 'We've had people throwing up, we've had 
people gagging on their drinks.

'Real trouble is when someone gets 
overenthusiastic. You never know when some fool is going to do 
something stupid. And then we'll be without a 
toe.'
