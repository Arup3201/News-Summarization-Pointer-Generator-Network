Miroslav Klose has beaten Ronaldo's record to become the top scorer in World Cup history.

The German forward scored his side's second goal in their staggering 7-1 victory in the semi-final against Brazil to become the record holder outright with 16.

'We are a team and it shows on the field,' he said.

'It's also important that our set pieces bring results. You saw it again today. Toni puts the ball where it has to go every time and that's a big strength.'

After scoring against Brazil, in his 23rd career World Cup game, Klose refrained from doing his trademark back flip.

'I got hit in my left foot while attempting a shot and I was not able to do the flip.'

Germany coach Joachim Loew praised the veteran and only true striker on the team.

'It
 really means a lot to all of us. This is a record. This is a record 
that could be beaten only by (Thomas) Mueller.

'We believe that he really
 deserves it. Because at his age, he is still playing at the highest 
possible level.'

It
 was his second of the tournament after he came off the bench against 
Ghana to net in the group stage, which put him level with the Brazil 
legend.

Klose's first World Cup appearance came in 2002, where he scored a hat trick in an 8-0 victory over Saudi Arabia.

He netted again in their next group game, a 1-1 draw with Republic of Ireland, before scoring the second in a 2-0 victory over Cameroon.

Despite Germany's run to the final that year, Klose failed to find the net again in the tournament, eventually finishing level on goals with Rivaldo, and behind top scorer Ronaldo who grabbed eight.

During his home World Cup four years later in 2006, the forward found the net five times again, which was enough for the Golden Boot.Â
