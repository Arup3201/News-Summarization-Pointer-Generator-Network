James Mears, 25, has been charged with killing two women in Philadelphia, one of whom was dubbed 'Grandma' because of her willingness to help 

A man charged with murder has claimed the 'kind-hearted' elderly woman he is accused of killing was a crack cocaine dealer. 

James Mears, 25, has been charged with killing two women in Philadelphia. 

He is accused of murdering 67-year-old Dollie Evans, who was dubbed 'Grandma' by her neighbors because of her willingness to help those in need, in her Philadelphia kitchen. 

He is also on trial for the alleged murder of her house-guest, Ruby Thomas, 57, which took place in August. 

Mears has claimed that Evans was a crack cocaine dealer who kept large stashes of cash in her house.  

A court was told how he colluded with another man to rob the elderly woman and steal her drugs. 

In a statement to homicide detectives, Mears, who had also been living in Evans' house for the previous two months, said that in August he got a phone call from an accomplice named 'Mann.' 

He and Mann agreed to set up a robbery in which Mears would leave the door to the house unlocked and Mann would enter and rob Evans at gunpoint and pretend to rob Mears, too. 

The accomplice entered the home with a silver handgun and allegedly shot Evans as she got her purse. He then went upstairs and shot her house-guest Ms Thomas, Mears told police. 

The two women were shot dead inside their home where Mr Mears had also been living for the past two months

Mr Mears told a court that Dollie Evans, 67, was a crack cocaine dealer who had wads of cash in her house

According to Mr Mears' statement to homicide detectives he plotted with another man to rob Evans

Mears said 'Mann' took between $700 to $800 in cash and about $500 worth of drugs. They were supposed to share the loot a week later, but Mears said he got locked up before then.

Asked why he would help another man rob an elderly woman who was housing him, Mears replied in his statement: 'For the money. It was rough times.' 

The investigation into the case continues.
