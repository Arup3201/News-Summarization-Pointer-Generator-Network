A Pennsylvania waitress received a major surprise when a regular customer offered to pay about $20,000 for her nursing school tuition - and has already agreed to cover her masters degree, too.

Melissa Manier, 25, was working at the Peachtree Restaurant and Lounge trying to pay off a student loan when regular Benjamin Olewine walked in the door.

Olewine, 92, happens to be Chairman Emeritus at food company Sysco Central Pennnsylvania, and is a known philanthropist. He told CBS News that he felt compelled to help Manier.

'You get to know [the waitresses]. You get to know their backgrounds. You get to know their problems and I just needed to help her,' he said.

Though his bill at the restaurant was reportedly a mere $3.45, Olewine offered much more to the struggling waitress.

'I said, "Melissa, I'd be happy to pay your tuition." And that's exactly how it happened,' Olewine told CBS News. He said he asked her 'two or three' more times for the tuition bill so he could cover it.

Manier is now a registered nurse - and as fate would have it, works at the Benjamin Olewine Spine, Bone, and Joint Institute at Pinnacle Health's General Osteopathic Hospital.

Manier told ABC27 she still finds thinks it's weird to ask Olewine to cover expenses.

'Anytime I get a bill that he helps me with, I still feel strange asking him because he really doesn't know me,' she said. 'It's just crazy.'

She also cried when asked by the station about the significance of Olewine's generosity.

'While I was in school, after he'd started paying for me, my dad passed away,' she told ABC27. 'I just keep thinking of him right now. He'd be so shocked and just so happy for me.'

Though Manier has not yet earned her bachelor's, Olewine has already offered to cover a master's degree. When asked about his decision, Olewine simply told CBS News, 'Well, I'm known as a big tipper.'
