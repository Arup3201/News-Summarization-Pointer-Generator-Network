Plans: Judge Keith Cutler led the inquest into the death of Mark Duggan

The coroner in the controversial Mark Duggan inquest has said he will ask the dead man’s family to help shape recommendations on police firearms procedure.

Senior circuit judge Keith Cutler told The Mail on Sunday he will take ‘the unusual, perhaps unique step’ of inviting submissions from the Duggan family.

Among the issues he will seek views on will be ‘training of officers and preparation for operations’.

It is the first time the judge, who was criticised in some quarters over his handling of the inquest, has spoken publicly about the case.

‘Whatever you think of him as an individual, Mark Duggan was somebody’s son,’ said the judge at his home in Wiltshire yesterday. ‘No one wanted him to die.’

Last week the inquest jury decided that 29-year-old Duggan – shot dead in a police ambush in Tottenham, north London in August 2011 – was lawfully killed. His death sparked riots across the country.

Jurors were given special protection by police as they left the Royal Courts of Justice, following the intimidation and abuse they faced from Duggan’s supporters during the hearing.

A senior Met commander said the scenes in court were totally unacceptable, while a leading crime prevention expert said they threatened to damage the ‘dignity’ of Britain’s most prestigious court.

Judge Cutler pointedly declined to respond to the criticism yesterday, but defended his decision to hold a 20-second silence for Duggan when the inquest began last September.

‘It was my idea. I know it was controversial, and I know the police were bristling about it and sections of the media were very critical, but I believe that Mark Duggan’s death led to a great deal of unrest.

I thought that a few moments’ reflection at the start of the inquest might be quite healing.

‘I used the words “regrettable death” at the time and there is no doubt that’s what it was. The police have said right from the start that his death was regrettable.

‘It’s interesting to see that now the inquest is over the police have taken up my phrase and are using the words “regrettable death” as they try to reach out to Mark’s family. That can only be a good thing.’

He added that he is about to begin formulating a series of recommendations on firearms procedure for the Home Secretary, following issues raised by the inquest.

‘In that sense the inquest is not quite complete,’ he said. ‘I will go quiet for a while but around the middle of February I will be announcing what recommendations I have made to the Secretary of State.

‘Normally I would hide away and come to my own conclusions about these recommendations but this has been a highly charged and high- profile case. I have wanted to have transparency for all the parties and the public.

‘In that spirit I am taking the unusual, perhaps unique, step of  inviting submissions from all the interested parties including the Duggan family. I’ll wait to receive all the views before sitting down and carefully considering any  recommendations that need to be made.

‘The obvious one, that officers wear head cameras on these types of operations, has already been put forward. But there will be other issues including the training of officers and preparation for operations.

‘I have told all the parties that I want to proceed in this way and the police have indicated they would like to hear what others have to say first before putting forward their own suggestions. That’s fair enough. I have no objection to that.’

Judge Cutler received advice during the inquest from the PR firm Champollion, fuelling speculation that they may have played a role in the decision to open the hearing with a silence. Evidence given to the inquest revealed that Duggan had been linked to ten shootings and two murders.

In the eight years before his death he was repeatedly arrested over a succession of serious crimes, including murder, attempted murder and firearms offences. Before his death, Duggan was followed by surveillance officers after picking up a gun from fellow underworld figure Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, jailed at the Old Bailey for 11 years last February.

Police believe he planned to use the pistol to avenge the murder of his cousin Kelvin Easton, who was stabbed to death with a bottle in a nightclub five months earlier.
