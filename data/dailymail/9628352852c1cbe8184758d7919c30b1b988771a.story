A renowned Japanese chef voluntarily surrendered his Michelin stars because he wanted to 'seek new challenges.'

Three-Michelin starred The Araki, owned by chef-patron Mitsuhiro Araki, recently relocated to New Burlington Street London from its original location in the Ginza district of Tokyo. 

The incredibly exclusive eaterie has only nine seats and charges diners £250 for a fixed menu of appetisers and different types of sushi.

'I left Japan to seek new challenges - I am immensely proud of what we achieved in Setagaya and Ginza but I still have much to learn,' Mr Araki said.  

The Araki's no-choice Sushi Omakase (omakase means 'as you like it' in Japanese) is a fixed menu. The £250 price tag doesn't include tempura (battered), meat, teriyaki (grilled) or karaage (deep fried) dishes.

The restaurant focuses entirely on the highest quality edomae (Tokyo style) sushi although the menu will experiment with traditional European flavours such as foie gras, caviar and truffle.

Mr Araki said: 'Change is an essential part of keeping the creative spark alive and that is why I find myself opening an entirely new restaurant for the third time in my life.' 

'Although we are nearly 6,000 miles away from the bay of Tokyo I am excited about welcoming guests to The Araki and sharing the true edomae experience.' 

The move to Europe has meant a change in suppliers and Mr Araki has overseen the sourcing of the fish, choosing tuna from Ireland and Spain. 

But sushi rice will be shipped from a farm in Saitama, north of Tokyo run by his father-in-law.

For drinks guests can opt for a wine pairing by Master Sommelier Gearoid Devaney or choose from three types of sake selected personally by Mr Araki and served in antique ceramics.

As well as the nine-seat counter, The Araki also has one six seat private room which will be opening soon. 

'It has only been open a week and demand is ramping up extremely quickly,' a spokesperson for The Araki told MailOnline Food.

'It is very gratifying that more than a third of the guests who have visited The Araki so far have re-booked immediately,' he continued.
