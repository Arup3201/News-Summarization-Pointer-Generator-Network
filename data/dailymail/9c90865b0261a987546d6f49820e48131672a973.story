Families camped illegally at Dale Farm are still being paid thousands of pounds in housing benefits by the council that is in an ongoing legal battle to have them evicted.

Basildon Council pays as much as £53,625 a year for 25 families at the 51-pitch site which the authority says they are entitled to, even though they have not got planning permission.

Leader, Tony Ball, said two years ago that benefits for mobile home rent paid to families on the illegal site had been stopped but yesterday it was confirmed that was not the case.

Barricades: Travellers staying illegally at Dale Farm are due to be evicted from the Essex site

Mr Ball said, however: 'I don’t remember saying
all claims had stopped, but was advised a number of claims were 
stopped. If I did say that, it was based on the information I was given 
at the time and said in good faith.

'Of course if payments are stopped 
individuals can appeal or new claims be made and I would not necessarily
be notified.' 

Travellers at the site can claim up to £25 a week in housing benefit and £845 in council tax - the equivalent of a band B property.

The eviction at Dale Farm was due to start on Monday but was stopped by a last-gasp High Court injunction over a technicality. Basildon Council is due to argue its case on Friday and hopes to continue with the site clearance later that day.

Council leader Tony Ball had previously said the authority had stopped paying benefits to Dale Farm residents

The heavily fortified gate at the only entrance was opened yesterday to comply with health and safety regulations about access for emergency vehicles. It is understood it will be replaced with a mobile barrier of vans.

A dozen caravans entered the site shortly after a pneumatic drill had been used to smash the concrete that was keeping the 30ft barrier in place.

Travellers claimed families were returning as they now felt it was safe for children to stay at the camp.

But others said the vehicles were returning from nearby empty legal pitches.

A source said: 'They broke into the plots on the legal side on Saturday and they are worried about what the owners will do to them if they come back and find their plots occupied.

'There is a feeling that they would rather take their chances with the bailiffs than risk all-out war with the English travellers who own plots on the legal side.'

The traveller in the first van to return said: 'I am not leaving again. Not until [council leader] Tony Ball has lost his job and [outspoken local resident] Len Gridley is dead in a coffin.'

Cllr Ball said: 'I am extremely disappointed by this latest development – it is irresponsible for the travellers that had previously left the site peacefully to return.

'No efforts have been made to take the main barricade at Dale Farm down either – the gates have simply been opened to allow travellers to return.

'The fact that this main barricade has not yet been removed and is unlikely to be shows a blatant disregard for the law and the obligations of the injunction.

'We must not forget that the travellers have used the law to their advantage at numerous times over the past decade and most recently on Monday, yet they seem to want to pick and choose what parts of the law they obey.

'These actions clearly go against the court order. We have done our bit, and I would continue to urge the travellers to do theirs.'

Families have been pitching up at Stockwood Park in Luton since Monday

Dozens of travellers from the site started arriving at Stockwood Park in Luton this week and set up an illegal camp in a public park.

Residents have said their disregard for other people was 'disgusting'.

One, who declined to be named for fear of reprisals, said: 'I'm lucky to have a view of trees and a field but I pay taxes to do so. I'd like to know what these people are paying for the privilege.

'There are plenty of places they could go – legal and illegal. Why do they have to be in everyone's faces here?'

Bedfordshire Police said they were not involved because it was a civil matter but confirmed patrols had been stepped up in the area.

A spokesman added: 'It's council land and it is for them to deal with.'

Luton Borough Council said the 'standard legal procedure for eviction' was begun on Monday.

A spokesman added: 'We expect to move them on very soon. The target is seven working days, assuming that there are no other complications.'
