Despite Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal all having a firm grip on English football since the turn of the century, it is the first time the trio have reached the FA Cup quarter-finals together since 1979.

This year's quarter-final between Manchester United and Arsenal is a repeat of the Wembley final 36 years ago, which Arsenal won 3-2.

But history is not on the side of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, who wants to close the curtain on his career at his boyhood club by winning the final this year, which falls on his birthday of May 30.

Arsenal's players celebrate winning the FA Cup after beating Manchester United in the final in 1979

Liverpool lost in the semi-finals to Manchester United in 1979 in a reply at Anfield after drawing the first encounter 2-2 at Old Trafford.

Nowadays, the semi-finals cannot be replayed and will take place at Wembley.

This year, as United and Arsenal will lock horns in the quarter-finals at Old Trafford, Liverpool face Championship side Blackburn at Anfield.
