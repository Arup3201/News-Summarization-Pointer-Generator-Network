They seem perfectly at ease behind the wheel, but are sure to turn the eyes of fellow drivers.

These hilarious pictures show dogs appearing to drive around streets in their owner's cars - with some going for a solo journey and others apparently carrying passengers along for the ride.

The mock-up photos posted on the Amazing Creature blog appear to be making light of news earlier this month in New Zealand, where a charity taught a trio of rescued dogs how to drive.

Paws for thought: This dog on the left appears to be quite comfortable driving itself and a passenger

Turning the wheel: The photos were posted on the Amazing Creature blog and apparently show dogs driving

Sharp concentration: Some of the dogs in the hilarious set of photos are seen going for a solo journey

Sitting in: This dog appears to have been photographed behind the wheel inside a parked car in a petrol station

Two mutts had made history by driving a car down a racetrack - with ten-month-old beardie cross Porter putting his paws to the pedals first, steering a Mini down a straight and then turning a corner.

He was followed by Monty, an 18-month-old giant schnauzer cross, who completed the same feat. The pair - along with one-year-old beardie whippet cross Ginny - had been taking driving lessons.

It began with them learning to steer a wooden cart pulled along on a string by their trainers. In eight weeks, they progressed to driving a real car, in which they sat on their haunches in the driverâ€™s seat.

The front paws of the dogs - rescued by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals - were on the steering wheel, with their back paws on levers attached to the accelerator and the brake.

Joke: The photos appear to be making light of recent news that dogs were being taught how to drive in real life

How cute: This dog appears to have full control of the steering wheel as he focuses on the road ahead

Old style: This dog seems to be enjoying himself behind the wheel of a blue Volvo with the windows down

Passenger: The dog on the right is struggling to get his head above the wheel in what appears to be a car park

And here are the dogs in New Zealand who really were taught how to drive...

Real thing: Ginny, a 12-month-old beardie whippet cross, drives a modified Mini Countryman on a race track in Auckland, New Zealand, after being taught how to drive

Focus: Monty, an 18-month-old giant schnauzer cross, was also trained to drive a car for a series of events to publicise the adoption of animals looked after by the shelter
