David Silva played his 200th game for Man City on Saturday. The club have spent a fortune on players, but if you want value for money, you need look no further than the little Spanish magician.

In terms of consistency, his performances are hard to match. He doesn’t cause any problems, he looks like he trains hard and he is a fantastic, technical player. He must be a manager’s dream.

City are so much better with him in the side, as the table below shows, and he is the kind of player you are happy to pay to watch. With West Brom, Burnley and Sunderland to come over Christmas, Silva could be just the man to help City get through their striker crisis.

BENTEKE BACK WITH A BANG

It was good to see Christian Benteke back to his best against Man United. He is a class act and an absolute monster and I’m pleased he’s overcome his injury problems.

Damaging your achilles tendon is always a worry — players don’t always get back to those same levels again. But Benteke is flying and I’m a big fan.

It’s good to see players like him catching the eye now. It’s not just your Costas and Agueros who are shining: there’s Benteke, Austin, Wilfried Bony, Saido Berahino, Harry Kane.

There’s a lot of striking quality in the Premier League this season and those players are scoring a high percentage of their team’s goals, as the table below shows.

Even Andy Carroll has come back in and proved himself when it looked as if he might not get a game at West Ham.

It’s so vital to have a front man who can lead the line well and score goals, and this season almost every team have one. All I know is I wouldn’t want to be a defender this Christmas.

GOAL MACHINE AUSTIN KEEPS ON MOTORING

 What a vein of form Charlie Austin has hit. He can’t stop scoring. He doesn’t seem to get many chances but when he does, he sticks them away. 

He is an arch goal poacher and saved QPR in a fantastic game against West Brom. That’s 11 Premier League goals now this season, but as our map shows, the majority of them have been scored on or around the penalty spot. He loves to sniff out opportunities and pounce.

His conversion rate is impressive, too. He’s seventh in the league in that respect, and behind top man Diego Costa. But he is above Sergio Aguero, which shows just how Austin is more than capable of coping at this level.

ERIK'S BIG CHALLENGE

Erik Lamela has taken plenty of stick from people, myself included.

There was a feeling the £30million price tag didn’t add up to the quality we’ve seen.

He’s scored two world-class goals this season, including the winner on Saturday, as our graphic shows. But one was in the Europa League and, no disrespect intended, the other was against Burnley.

I still feel he’s a bit lightweight but credit where credit is due.

The key for Lamela now is to go and affect big games. He needs to score in a derby match or do something where we can all sit back and say: ‘So that’s why they paid £30million.’ That’s the next challenge.

NO DEFENCE FOR SLOPPY GOALS

Aside from Philippe Coutinho’s goal, the others conceded at Anfield summed up Liverpool and Arsenal’s seasons: too many sloppy mistakes.

Both sides can be a joy to watch but they concede so softly. Martin Skrtel’s header was good but Kieran Gibbs showed no urgency to get back on the line and Per Mertesacker ducked out of the way. I’m sorry, but that’s just not good enough.

I saw a lot of positives for Liverpool and it would have been a travesty if they had lost. They conceded goals last year but the difference then was they kept scoring — at the same stage they had 42 goals, twice as many as 2014-15, and Luis Suarez had 19 of them. That’s only two fewer than the whole squad this season.

Daniel Sturridge’s return will help and on Sunday there were signs of improvement.

AWAY THE LADS...

Three wins in a row at St James’ Park is an amazing achievement for Sunderland and since they lost 8-0 at Southampton, they are undefeated away from home.

That form is so important for the teams who are scrapping at the bottom of the table because it eases the pressure on your home games.

Watching Adam Johnson, you always feel you want a bit more from him because he’s got so much ability. But scoring big goals against your rivals is the kind of thing that can make you an icon at your club.

ALL SYSTEMS GO 

It didn’t take long for people to ditch 3-5-2 at the start of the season but it was back in fashion this weekend.

Liverpool, Manchester United, Aston Villa, Hull and Southampton all played it and I wouldn’t be surprised if others join in.

It can help you get more possession, rotation and movement so it’s definitely not dead yet.

BOURNEMOUTH STRIKE IT RITCH

Last week my old club Bournemouth did OK against Liverpool but when Eddie Howe made six changes for that game, the next one was always going to be interesting. 

It made no difference. They hit Blackpool for six and Matt Ritchie scored two. I’d be surprised if he’s not in the Premier League soon, either with Bournemouth or another team.

NUMBER CRUNCHING

Nine -  Though Silva was undoubtedly the man of the match for Man City, much of the team’s second-half attacking impetus on Saturday came through full backs Pablo Zabaleta and Aleksandar Kolarov. The defenders — who both laid on goals — have provided nine assists each since the start of last season — a total betteredonly by Everton’s Leighton Baines.

27 - Andy Carroll scored his first Premier League goal with his foot since April 2013 — a period of 27 games. His last four goals have all come from his head.

Eight - Following their 3-0 win against Crystal Palace, Man City have won eight matches in a row in all competitions — a run stretching back to late November. 

One - The pressure may be on Leicester manager Nigel Pearson with his side sitting bottom of the league, but Steve Bruce hasn’t fared much better this season — his Hull team are only three points better off than the Foxes, with just one win in their last 16 games. 

2-1 - Spurs have won their last four Premier League games 2-1 when Harry Kane has got his name on the scoresheet — as he did against Burnley. 

1,510 - Erik Lamela finally scored his first league goal for Tottenham on Saturday. The Argentina midfielder had to wait 1,510 minutes for his duck to end.

One - Philippe Coutinho has been Liverpool’s best player on occasions this season, but his opener against Arsenal on Sunday was his first goal at Anfield since the 3-2 win over Man City last April. He is also yet to provide an assist in the PL.
