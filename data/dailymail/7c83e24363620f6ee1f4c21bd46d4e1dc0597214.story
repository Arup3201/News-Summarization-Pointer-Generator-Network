Shares in Domino’s Pizza have hit an all-time high this week to complete a remarkable turnaround some five years after the delivery company suffered a major public relations crisis when footage of employees playing with the food surfaced.

In April 2009 a prank video was posted on YouTube showing an employee violating health-code standards by putting cheese up his nose and sneezing over food.

The video was watched by more than a million disgusted viewers and Domino’s faced a serious credibility crisis as customers stayed away and its share price suffered.

The incident forced the company to make big changes and now five years on the company is bucking the trend among other fast food giants – including McDonalds and rival Pizza Hut owner Yum! Brands - and is gaining customers and expanding its business. 

The 10,000-plus-unit global pizza delivery chain has undertaken major overhauls of its menu, recipes, use of technology and, most recently, look and feel.

'We've done a lot of transformation of our brand. We expanded our menu with things like stuffed cheesy bread and sandwiches, and in 2010 we even transformed our core pizza,' said Brandon Solano, vice president of store development at the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based chain.

Profits are up 16 percent according to Domino's latest earnings report and the company added 160 stores in the last quarter alone, reports CNN Money.

Since announcing its impressive third quarter figures earlier this month, shares in Domino's have skyrocketed 13 percent and on Wednesday hit an all-time high for the pizza company - a long way from the doldrums after an embarrassing YouTube video leaked in 2009

Since announcing its impressive third quarter figures earlier this month, shares have skyrocketed 13 percent and on Wednesday hit an all-time high.

Domino’s is enticing consumers with low-cost offers such as two pizzas for $5.99 each, while innovations such as the launch of breaded chicken bites loaded with pizza toppings, including cheese and bacon, in April have also helped.

Restaurants have also been refitted as 'pizza theaters' which let customers see how their food is prepared and provide a more welcoming experience than was previously on offer. 

Technology has also played a key role. In June Domino's launched a 'Siri-style' voice ordering app, which had taken over 200,000 orders by the end of September.

The emphasis on technological innovation helped Domino's generate approximately 40 percent of U.S. sales from  digital channels in 2013, as well as reach an estimated $3 billion annually in global sales. 

The U.S.'s big four chains - Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's and Little Caesars - together have little more than 40 percent of the market at present and analysts predict these innovations could help Domino's continue to grow.

Founded in 1960, Domino's has a significant business in carryout pizza, but also has more than 11,250 stores in over 75 international markets.

In 2013, Domino's had global retail sales of over $8.0 billion - comprised of nearly $3.8 billion in the U.S. and over $4.2 billion internationally.
