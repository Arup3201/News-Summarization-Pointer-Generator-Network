Apple is to plans Monday to pump $2 billion over the coming decade into a data center 'global command' facility in Arizona.

The project represents one of the largest investments ever by the maker of the iPhone, iPod, iPad and Macintosh computer.

'We're proud to continue investing in the US with a new data center in Arizona, which will serve as a command center for our global networks,' Apple said.

'Like all Apple data centers, it will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy, much of which will come from a new local solar farm.'

The facility with some 120,000 square meters (1.3 million square feet) had been the planned site of a plant to produce sapphire glass screens in a collaboration with GT Advance Technologies.

The collaboration came apart late last year after GTAT filed for bankruptcy and accused Apple of saddling the company with onerous terms in the deal.

State officials said the investment is a good deal for Arizona.

'Apple is a company that we wanted to come to Arizona, previously with a third party,' state Governor Doug Ducey said during a press conference.

'Now, we have Apple itself investing in our state. 

'This is a one-of-a-kind company, they just had a world record quarterly earnings, and they are coming to Arizona.'

Ducey said Apple has made a 30-year commitment with the data center, and that it will sign on about 150 employees along with creating hundreds of construction jobs during the building phases.

Greenpeace senior IT sector analyst Gary Cook lauded Apple's decision to build an Arizona data center powered by renewable energy.

'Apple remains the most aggressive among major IT companies in delivering on its commitments to be 100 percent renewable, and has shown the business community that solar is ready, here and now, to power our economy,' Cook said.

He calls on other technology industry titans, particularly Amazon and its massive cloud services operation, to follow suit. 

The announcement comes four months after an earlier Apple plan for the 1.3 million-square-foot facility it bought in 2013 failed. 

The tech giant had a deal with Merrimack, New Hampshire-based GT Advanced to use the plant to make sapphire glass for its products, but the company declared bankruptcy in October after production issues developed. 

GT openly accused Apple of using a 'classic bait-and-switch strategy' with a deal that he called 'massively one-sided.'

Apple lawyers accused GT of making false statements about the deal, among other allegations.

After the GT failure, Apple said it would work to find another use for the plant. It also has been working to help more than 600 GT employees who lost their jobs.

An Apple spokesman said construction on the new data center should start late next year, if not earlier. 

GT is storing advanced furnaces it planned to use in its Apple venture at the plant while the furnaces are being liquidated, delaying the immediate use of the plant. 

Apple also has committed to building and financing 70 megawatts of new solar power generation, enough to power more than 14,500 homes. 

Apple's data centers provide the computer muscle for the company's iCloud, ITunes, Siri and other products.
