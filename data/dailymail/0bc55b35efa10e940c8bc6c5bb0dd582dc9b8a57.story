Jessica Wynter gave birth to her baby son Kye in a onesie after he was born suddenly as she struggled across a hospital car park

A young mother who gave birth in a onesie as she struggled across a hospital car park has described the moment she found her baby son ‘curled up in the right leg, safe and sound’.

Jessica Wynter was taken to hospital by her parents after she went into labour one-week early.

But she ran out of time when she got to the car park of King's College Hospital, in Lambeth, south London, and little Kye was born in the onesie.

Ms Wynter, 21, described how at the time she thought her waters had broken, saying it 'felt like a rubber duck slapped across my leg'.

She said it was lucky she had been wearing the garment as it prevented baby Kye from hitting the floor.

She said: 'I got up because I wasn't in pain any more. My mum came over and we could both hear crying coming from inside.

'I unzipped the onesie and Kye was curled up in the right leg, safe and sound.

'He looked really happy just sitting there.'

Ms Wynter said she woke up at three in the morning on December 27 suffering from serious back pain.

The Coventry University design student, from Streatham, was in pain throughout the day and decided to get into a hot bath at 5.30pm in a bid to soothe her backache.

She then realised however that she was going into labour.

She put on the polka dot adult-sized babygro as her mother Christine and father Davonne helped her into the car to race to hospital.

She was undergoing contractions in the car and ran out of time straight after arriving at the hospital car park.

Following the birth, the pair were stretchered into the maternity ward where medics checked little Kye to make sure he was healthy

Kye was suddenly born as his mother struggled across the car park to the hospital.

He was caught safely in the leg of his mother's polka dot onesie, given to her at Christmas by her grandmother Enid.

Ms Wynter said: 'My contractions were nearly five minutes apart and my back was in agony - I realised I was in labour.

'It
 was really scary. I went in the bath a couple of times for the pain. By
 the time dad got home I knew that we had to go to the hospital.

'We left around half five in the afternoon. I was yelling "He's here he's here".

'I was in the back seat of the car screaming my heart out.

Ms Wynter said it was 'so lucky' she put the onesie on before going to the hospital

'I was really frightened and in pain and I kept worrying we would be stopped because I had no seatbelt.'

She
 said: 'And I knew something had come out. I thought it was the water 
sack. It felt like a rubber duck slapped across my leg.'

Ms Wynter said eight doctors turned up following the birth, with one throwing a blanket over the new mother to keep her warm.

She was then stretchered into the maternity ward where medics checked little Kye to make sure he was healthy.

Ms Wynter said: 'His temperature was a little bit low because he was born outside but apart from that he seemed fine.

'He was born at 39 weeks, a week early.

'I just threw on the onesie as I came out of the bath. It could have been anything else, it's so lucky.

'If it had been something like a nightie I don't think he would have survived.

'I was in so much shock when I saw him on my leg. I couldn't believe it.

Lots of babies don't stick to a time schedule so every day surprise deliveries can regularly be a cause of havoc for parents as well as medical staff.

Last summer, MailOnline reported how on Tuesday, June 18, a father delivered his daughter's baby in the front seat of his car, while three days later a baby said hello to the world in a police station.

Two weeks previously an eager tot arrived a month early while his blindsided mother was on the toilet.

Father-of-three, Tony Hall, described how he delivered his daughter's baby in the front seat of his car on a busy road after he had been driving her to hospital when he was caught up in heavy school traffic in Welling in Bexley, London.

And Kayleigh Thompson and Dan Hunt, who worked together to deliver their baby boy in their bathroom on May 31, have a lasting reminder of the big day after they named him Lou.

'I've got to keep the onesie in my keepsake box- it's just so surreal.

'I'm sure I'll tell him all about it when he's older, probably as soon as he can talk.'

Doctors said Kye, who was born at 6lb 5oz, was healthy and well enough for the pair to be allowed to return home the same day.

The onesie has been washed and will be kept in a keepsake box as a reminder of Kaye's dramatic arrival.

Ms Wynter's father Davonne, 48, said: 'It's a real shock to the system.

'When I was coming home from work I had no idea what was about to happen.

'I parked in the drop off area in the hospital and went to call the labour unit to let them know Jessica had arrived.

'I got back and she was on all fours in pain screaming. The next thing I knew, about eight medical staff appeared and it was all over.

'She thought she had given birth to the water sac, not the actual baby.

'We were all in a state of complete shock. If it had been a night dress who knows what could have happened, it's such a blessing really.

'I'm just thankful that she had the onesie on - it's so lucky he's safe.

'I'm sure lot's of young mums are going to want them now.'
