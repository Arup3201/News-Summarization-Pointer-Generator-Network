Photos of the squalid conditions of a house at the centre of an abuse investigation detail the shocking living environment of children who went unnoticed by authorities

The 'House of Horrors' in Adelaide's Parafield Gardens was home to 21 children who suffered through starvation and torture

The children who were aged between four and seven were discovered in 2008, and the ringleaders of the abuse were sentenced in 2011.

The children had been starved to the point of malnutrition, with examinations showing that their brains had shrunk from the deprivation to basic nutrients. 

All five children were were found to have ulcers on their legs and feet, were covered with scabies, and had stunted growth.

The Casuarina Drive house smelled of urine, and a dead dog was found rotting in the yard, reported The Australian. 

Justice Kevin Duggan said that the manner with which the children had been treated was 'beyond comprehension', reported The Telegraph. 

More shocking images surfaced from another house in Adelaide last month where a mother a four-year-old boy, who weighed just 8.3kg when he was discovered by police, was 'too busy having sex' to properly care for her son

The mother posted images on Facebook of cooking roast beef and chocolate dessert as her starving son was locked in his bedroom

 The 28-year-old father and the 24-year-old mother pleaded guilty to an aggravated charge of endangering their son's life

More shocking images surfaced from another house in Adelaide last month where a mother a four-year-old boy, who weighed just 8.3kg when he was discovered by police, was 'too busy having sex' to properly care for her son, The Adelaide District Court heard on October 28.

The 24-year-old woman told police she was preoccupied with her partner and put him before her toddler, who was discovered just days from death and is now in foster care.

The images of the trashed house reveal the rooms pile high with rubbish and filth littered throughout the home while the child was fed under his locked door and lived in a small room full of soiled nappies.

The court heard the young victim, who is now in foster care, still hides food in his pockets, hates doors being closed and is not yet toilet trained. 

Doctors said the boy’s dehydration level was at 10 percent and was two days away from reaching a critical level of 15 percent. 

Prosecutors have called for a lengthy jail sentence after the 28-year-old father and the 24-year-old mother pleaded guilty to an aggravated charge of endangering their son's life. They will be sentenced in December.

The children were reportedly made to stand in a line for hours with their hands on their heads, beaten if they requested more than the scraps of food they were given, and their hands tied with sticky tape at night to prevent them from obtaining more to eat.

The abuses were discovered by authorities when one of the young boys was taken to the Lyell McEwan Hospital after fainting from malnutrition and hypothermia. 

'It reached the point where the children were made to stand in the same position from morning to night,' said the Adelaide Supreme Court judge. 

'The adults were vigilant to make sure they were prevented from eating anything more.'

Justice Duggan said that the house was 'not fit for habitation'.

'The deteriorating condition of the children must have been evident to every adult in the household, he said.  

The children had only recently moved to Adelaide from Geelong in Victoria, reported The Advertiser, and so little information had reached authorities, who said that there was almost no evidence of the children's existence. 

The alleged ringleader was Tania Staker, now 39, a mother of 14, was sentenced to 10 years in jail, and the children's father Luke Armistead, now 51, was jailed for nine years.

Mr Armistead's stepfather Robert Armistead, now 44, and Ms Staker's brother, Michael Quinlivan, now 30, were jailed for nine years on three counts of endangering life and two counts of creating a risk of serious harm.  

Six of the 21 children were removed from the house and placed into care, reported InDaily.

It has been alleged by one of the victims of the abuse that a welfare worker, in the employ of Families SA and was aware that the children were living in the squalid conditions, failed to alert authorities, reported news.com.au. 

A child protection worker, who is now engaged to a relative of one of the men charged in the case, reportedly visited the house on many occasions, but would not enter and instead sat outside.

The welfare worker was not under any legal obligations to report the conditions as she was not officially assigned to any cases involving the property.

'The first couple of times she visited ... she was friends of the adults ... she had been inside the house,' said the woman.

'Other times she came, she would only sit out the front of the house.' 

Five years after the discovery of the house, the South Australian government released a response to the recommendations made by Child Death and Serious Injury Committee. 

There was allegedly 'almost no information known about the children to state authorities' until the boy was taken to hospital, said Committee chairwoman Deej Eszenyi. 

Different agencies including Families SA had records of the children, and Ms Eszenyi said that if the different body had shared information more might been done sooner. 

'There was a possibility that the house might have been entered before the crimes against these children occurred,' she said.
