Theo Walcott is set to return to the Arsenal squad for the trip to Sunderland on Saturday after nine months out with a knee ligament injury.

Walcott, 25, came through a 45-minute outing for the Arsenal Under 21 team last Friday and could link up with Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez for the first time in what would be one of the fastest attacks in the Premier League.

Walcott - who has not played for Arsenal since suffering a serious knee injury in the FA Cup against Tottenham in January - returned to full training earlier this month. 

The England international was pictured training on Friday, along side team-mates Jack Wilshere and Mikel Arteta among others, as Arsenal prepared to take on Sunderland, who were thrashed 8-0 by Southampton last weekend.

Arsenal will be looking to inflict even more misery of Gus Poyet's team as Arsene Wenger hunts for a much needed three points to resurrect his team's league form.

The north London side are seventh in the table with 11 points after eight games - 11 points behind leaders Chelsea.

Arsenal fans will no doubt be hoping the new look front three of Sanchez, Welbeck and Walcott combine for the first time this season.

If Wenger is tempted to try it out against a brittle Sunderland defence that was repeatedly dismantled by Southampton last weekend, Sunderland fans could be witnessing carnage once again.
