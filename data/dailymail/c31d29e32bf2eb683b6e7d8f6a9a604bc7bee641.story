A farmer was killed after being knocked over and eaten alive by his hogs, authorities said.

Terry Vance Garner, 69, had gone to feed the herd on his Oregon ranch at 7.30am last Wednesday and never returned.

A family member later found Garner’s 
dentures and pieces of his body scattered throughout the hog enclosure, but most of his 
remains had been consumed.

The Coos County district attorney’s office said in a statement on Monday that it’s possible Garner had a medical emergency, such as a heart attack, or was knocked over by the animals before he was killed.

However criminal activity has not been ruled out and an investigation was ongoing.

‘For all we know, it was a horrific 
accident, but it's so doggone weird that we have to look at all 
possibilities,’ Coos County District Attorney Paul Frasier told The 
Register-Guard.

Some of the hogs weighed an abnormally large 700 pounds on the farm close to the rural town of Riverton. Most hogs are raised to a market weight of between 250-300lbs.

The DA’s office said at least one hog had either bitten or been aggressive with Mr Garner in the past.

A pathologist was unable to identify a
 cause or manner of death, the newspaper reported. The remains will be 
examined by a forensic anthropologist at the University of Oregon.

Michael Garner, 75, the deceased's older brother, told The Register-Guard that his sibling was ‘a good-hearted guy’ who cared for several huge adult sows and a boar named Teddy.

Piglets were typically sold to local 4-H kids.

The victim's brother added that the 69-year-old man was a Vietnam veteran who suffered post-traumatic stress and that his life had been turned around by living on the farm. 

‘Those animals were his life,’ Michael Garner said. ‘He had all kinds of birds, and turkeys that ran all over the place. Everybody knew him.’

Michael Garner said one of the large sows bit his brother last year when he accidentally stepped on a piglet.

Dangerous precedent: A pig once bit the 69-year-old farmer, but Garner decided not to kill the animal

‘He said he was going to kill it, but when I asked him about it later, he said he had changed his mind,’ the brother said.

Domestic hogs are not typically known to be as aggressive as their feral cousins, but ‘there is some degree of danger associated with any animal,’ John Killefer, who heads the Animal and Rangeland

Sciences Department at Oregon State University in Corvallis, told the newspaper.While pigs ‘are more omnivorous than other farm animals, (such as) cows,’ Killefer called the case highly unusual.

Most hogs are raised until they reach a market weight of between 250 and 300 pounds, while breeding female pigs rarely weigh more than 400 pounds, Killefer said.
