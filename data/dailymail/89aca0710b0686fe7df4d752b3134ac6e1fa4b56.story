Its nickname, the City of Churches, doesn't exactly conjure up images of a fast-paced 24/7 city but it seems international visitors can't get enough of Adelaide.

The city has just been voted the best city in Australia - the latest accolade for the South Australian capital.

Adelaide narrowly beat Hobart, followed Melbourne in third - with Sydney ranked seventh among reviewers, just beating top-end city Darwin.

Not just churches anymore: Despite being known as the 'City of Churches', many international publications have started placing Adelaide on lists of places to visit

Last year, Adelaide came in ninth on Lonely Planet's top 10 cities to visit in 2014 - the only Australian city to be included, and beating Auckland as the best city in the Asia-Pacific region.

Declaring Adelaide as 'effortlessly chic', the travel guide company noted the city's recent attempts at rejuvenation.

Every commendation Adelaide has received in the past 18-months is quick to note the city's proximity to Australia's famed Barossa Valley - one of the country's key wine regions.

'Like a perfectly cellared red, it’s ready to be uncorked and sampled,' the Lonely Planet list claims.

Who knew Adelaide was famous for the beaches? The beaches of South Australia have been highlighted as worth visiting by several publications

Adelaide (South Australia) - 4.15/5Hobart (Tasmania) - 4.11/5Melbourne (Victoria) - 4.02/5Brisbane (Queensland) - 4.00/5Perth (Western Australia) - 3.99/5Canberra (ACT) - 3.96/5Sydney (New South Wales) - 3.94/5Darwin (Northern Territory) - 3.88/5

New South Wales - 3,004,914 Queensland - 2,033,753 Victoria - 1,958,410  Western Australia - 764,545 South Australia - 377,703Northern Territory - 260,436 Australian Capital Territory - 181,686  Tasmania - 159,318

Meanwhile, two US publications - New York magazine and the Chicago Tribune - wrote glowing reviews of the South Australian capital in 2013.

'Adelaide has eclectic cuisine, idyllic beaches, Shiraz wineries, and kangaroo-spotting galore—but with a fraction of the tourists and for a whole lot cheaper,' Alexa Tsoulis-Reay wrote in a New York magazine article titled 'Adelaide Instead of Sydney' in October of last year.

The magazine's main claim that Adelaide trumps Sydney as being the best city: it has 'a fraction of the tourists' and is 'a whole lot cheaper' than visiting the eastern Australian capitals that dominate tourism tables in terms of actual visitors.

Another controversial claim in the magazine is that Adelaide is Australia's equivalent to US hipster capital Portland.

Despite the latest poll, by tourism website Wotif.com, many Australians would disagree, claiming that Melbourne - with it's coffee culture, laneway bars and active live music scene - would certainly be considered the 'hipster capital'.

Similarly, the Chicago Tribune featured Kangaroo Island as another key region to visit Adelaide.

'Just offshore, Kangaroo Island teams with kangaroos, penguins and sea lions, and from June to October its waters are inhabited by southern right whales,' wrote Peter Ferry in April, 2013.

While magazines, tourist guides and hotel booking website may be ranking Adelaide as Australia's most popular city, the claim would definitely be refuted by official tourist figures by Austrade agency Tourism Research Australia.

Despite coming first in the Wotif.com survey, South Australia comes in fifth based on actual tourist traffic to the state.

Having come in second-last in this survey, Sydney (and New South Wales) can breathe a sigh of relief - in terms of actual tourist figures, it's still number one.

Third and fourth: Victoria (Melbourne's Flinders Street Station pictured left) and Western Australia (Perth's Swan Bells pictured right) are ranked third and fourth, according to official tourism figures
