When he was elected Prime Minister he dispensed with his police motorbike outriders and said he was willing to sit in traffic like anyone else.

But now David Cameron has been forced to step up his security after a jogger ran into him on Monday in Leeds sparking a major alert.

A team of four motorcyclists have begun escorting Mr Cameron’s prime ministerial car following a review of his protection.

David Cameron was seen leaving Parliament  following PMQs on Wednesday  with his police outriders - just two days after being ran into by a jogger on Monday. He had originally dispensed with the motor cycle escort

The Prime minister outriders have now been re- introduced following the increase in security arrangements

In 2010, after being elected Prime Minister, Mr Cameron scrapped his motorcycle outriders - and was pictured stuck in traffic

After his weekly Commons appearance at Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron was accompanied by a police escort that helped him speed through traffic.

As his Jaguar left the Houses of Parliament shortly before he was due to host a lunch a short distance away at Downing Street, a team of four motorbike outriders joined his convoy.

Gordon Brown used outriders for most car journeys on security grounds, but when Mr Cameron was elected in 2010 he decided to do without them.

A No 10 source at the time said: ‘The Prime Minister feels this is probably an unnecessary extravagance. He is happy to put up with the same type of driving conditions as everyone else.'

The source added: ‘Mr Cameron feels that the police have better things to do than hold back traffic to let him get through more quickly.

‘It was an expense, or perhaps an ostentation, that he did not feel he needed.’

The decision saved the Met Police tens of thousands of pounds a year but it caused consternation from security experts who said the outriders are needed to keep the PM’s car moving so it does not become a sitting target and can escape quickly if there is an attack. 

The Prime Minister was shoved by a member of the public who was later arrested but then released

Mr Cameron was in Leeds city centre today when the major lapse of security occurred

Mr Cameron can be clearly seen bracing as he spots the jogger running towards him, while security appear oblivious

Dai Davies, a former head of Royalty Protection at Scotland Yard, yesterday welcomed the decision to bring back the outriders.

He said: ‘I’m delighted that common sense has kicked in at long last. I was astonished and dismayed when they did away with the Special Escort Group.

‘Keeping a principal moving at all times is key to protection, especially with the phenomenon of suicide bombers.

‘I would hope that following Leeds there has been a swift review of the Prime Minister’s security.’

Protection measures are under review after a jogger evaded Mr Cameron’s armed bodyguards and bumped into him on Monday as he left an event.

The 28-year-old was arrested but released saying it was 'nothing sinister, just a man in the wrong place at the wrong time'

Response: Runner Dean Balboa Farley said he brushed the PM before being assaulted by police

Dean Farley, 28, almost knocked the Prime Minister off his feet before being taken away by police officers.

Mr Cameron was unhurt after the incident in Leeds but it exposed gaps in security around him at a time when the terrorist threat level has been raised.

Westminster is currently on high alert in case of a terrorist attack on Parliament after the shooting of a ceremonial guard outside the Canadian parliament. 

MPs are being told to consider fitting their constituency offices with panic buttons and designating a 'safe room' in their homes. They are also being briefed on the security plans in case of an attack on the Commons.

Troops with machine guns have also been deployed at Horse Guards Parade.

Both Downing Street and the Metropolitan Police declined to comment on the new protection arrangements.
