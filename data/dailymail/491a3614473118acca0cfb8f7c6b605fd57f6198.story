Michael Sam, the NFL's first openly gay player, has told Oprah in a new interview  that other gay men in the league contacted him to give their gratitude and respect following his monumental coming out earlier this year, revealing: 'There's alot of us out there.'

'I'm not the only one - I'm just the only one that's open,' Sam adds in a clip for the interview, which will air in-full on Saturday after a 90-minute documentary produced by the OWN network about the inspirational athlete.

The sit-down with Winfrey is the 24-year-old's first since being cut from the St. Louis Rams and then dropped by the Dallas Cowboys, and she presses him on the other men in the NFL who have chosen not to come out.

Sam refuses to give a number at how many other players are gay, but says a small number contacted him.

'Very few reached out to me and pretty much just told me their gratitude and how thankful they were that I had the courage (to come out publicly),' Sam said. 

'They wished that they had the courage to come out.

'(They) just showed their respect and admired my courage … It was very good.'

In the full interview, Sam will answer a question from Winfrey as to whether believes being gay stopped him from getting on the NFL roster this year.

When asked by TMZ why he thought he was not on the roster of an NFL team, Sam said; 'I think I was the SEC Defensive Player of the Year last year ... so I don't think it had to do with talent.'  

Earlier this month, Sam received a GQ Man of the Year award.

He celebrated the accolade by kissing his partner, Vito Cammisano, on the photo wall at the event.

In his cover story with the magazine, the former University of Missouri star also spoke of the other gay men in the league, and the belief that maybe others would have followed him.

'I said I'd take everything that came at me (after coming out), and I did,' he told the publication.

'But did I think it was gonna be that huge? No. 

'I thought people would be just, "Okay, he came out." 

'And that would be that. Some thought others would join me. I did, too.'

When the interviewer told Sam that 'it' - other players coming out - 'may' happen, a defiant Sam answered: 'It will'

Cut: Sam was initially selected to play for the St Louis Rams, left, before being cut; he was then named in a Dallas Cowboys practice squad, right, but was then cut from the team, too

Sam was named the 2013 SEC Co-Defensive Player of the Year and quickly became a front-running up-and-comer. 

In February he announced he was gay through interviews with ESPN and The New York Times.

He later said that while he was comfortable with his sexuality, he believed that he was soon about to be 'outed' and wanted to beat anyone else to the punch.

Sam was forced to wait until the 249th pick in the seventh round of the 2014 draft before being selected by the Rams, The Huffington Post report.

However he failed to make the Ram's roster. 

He was then picked by the Cowboys' practice squad, but also failed to the make the cut.

He was released by Dallas in October. 

'While this is disappointing, I will take the lessons I learned here in Dallas and continue to fight for an opportunity to prove that I can play every Sunday,' he wrote on Twitter at the time.

Reaffirming: Sam said he didn't believe his sexuality is why he was not playing in the NFL

Sam also told GQ of his abusive childhood growing up in Texas and how he was physically and verbally abused his brothers every day.

He said he would wake up before sunrise each weekend and go out walking for the entire day, returning when the sun set, hoping he wouldn't have to deal with any of his siblings.

Sam is one of seven children.

His sister passed away before his born and two of his brothers are in prison. 

Another brother has been missing since 1998.
