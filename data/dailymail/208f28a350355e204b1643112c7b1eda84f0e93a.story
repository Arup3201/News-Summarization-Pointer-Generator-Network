A mother who spent her disabled daughter's benefits on bingo and weekends away today insisted she was not a bad parent.

Despite spending £124,536 intended for 25-year-old daughter Hayley, Julie Smith, 46, blamed her addiction to gambling saying it was a release from caring.

Birmingham Crown Court heard that Hayley has cerebral palsy and is unable to walk or talk and as a result receives money for her car, day centre trips and specialist equipment.

But instead her mother spent the 
money over a six year period from 2006 to 2012 on gambling, cigarettes, 
weekends away and nights out.

Smith said: 'I am a gambling addict. Caring for Hayley is full-on and I needed and escape. you want to switch off.

'But I'm not a bad parent. I love Hayley, she is my world. She's never gone without.'

Smith began siphoning off her 
daughter's money in 2006 but was caught out when Birmingham City Council
 realised the money had not been accounted for.

Smith added: 'They wanted receipts 
and I didn't have them. I don't think Hayley knows what has gone on.  I 
haven't much of a family - about half don't know about it. The money didn't just go on me, it went on the whole family.

Freed: Smith was speared jail at Birmingham Court Court, pictured, and was instead ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid community service

'It didn't go on holidays or luxuries like that. I
 smoke 20 to 30-a-day and I hardly drink or go out. But I admit I did 
wrong and I want to say sorry to social services for that. The money was
 there and I got into a habit.'

Smith also blamed internet betting sites for her addiction, saying: 'It's too easy to get sucked in.'

She was given a community order and told to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work.

Judge Patrick Thomas told her: 'The 
figures here are enormous. The plain position is that you received money
 intended for the benefit of your daughter.

'You
 spent it in ludicrous ways, sometimes on internet gambling and also on 
luxuries you appreciated far more than your daughter did, as if the 
money was part of your own state benefit.

'You plainly knew what you were doing.The principle concern of the court must be for your daughter.'
