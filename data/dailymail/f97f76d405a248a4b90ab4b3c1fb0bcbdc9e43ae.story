A cash-strapped disabled Spanish woman is auctioning off her non-vital organs in a bid to keep financially afloat.

The 44-year-old mother-of-one, who has not been named, said she was selling off one of her kidneys, corneas, a lung and a piece of her liver because she cannot afford her monthly rent and is facing eviction.

She told El Mundo newspaper in an interview: 'All I want is a home, a job I can do, and enough money to support my daughter through her studies.

'I just need to do what I can for my daughter - her life is what's most important. I don't care about my own any more.

'I started off trying to sell a kidney, but now I'm not just selling that, I'm also selling my corneas, one of my lungs and a piece of my liver.

'I will sell whatever piece of my body that someone wants to buy and I am selling it out of desperation.'

The Valencia resident, who faces 12 years in jail for 'illegal organ trafficking' if caught, said she only received 426 Euros in dole money per month.

And because she is certified 66 per cent disabled due to a severe back problem, it means she is severely restricted in the type of jobs she can do.

So, despite being offered a low rent by Valencia City Hall which would come to just 400 Euros per month, she can only really afford a fraction of that amount.

She told the newspaper she had spoken to a woman doctor in Melilla, one of the two Spanish-owned cities on the north Moroccan coast, about selling her non-vital organs.

It resulted in posting an advert online, but so far it has not produced a response. This is because, in reality, it is nearly impossible to sell organs, and is illegal in most countries.

It has not been revealed on exactly which site the announcement has been placed. But the woman said her body parts are 'all she has' and 'the only thing she can raise money from'.

The newspaper reported that her 22-year-old student daughter receives a small orphan's pension after her natural father died some years ago.

They both live in a house owned by the woman's ex-boyfriend, from whom she separated after he regularly beat her up during their 15-year relationship.

She reported him on several occasions, but when the case went to court, a judge found the woman's former partner not guilty.

She said that, in the three years since they split up, things 'had gone from bad to worse' and that he was now trying to evict her as she could not pay the rent.
