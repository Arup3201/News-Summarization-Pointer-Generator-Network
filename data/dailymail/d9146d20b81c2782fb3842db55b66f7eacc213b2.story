A marine archaeologist told today how his sea exploration company discovered two World War freighters ontaining silver bullion worth £162million.

Scotsman Neil Cunningham-Dobson, 55, was at the controls of the Remotely Operated Vehicle as the World War II cargo ship SS Gairsoppa and the World War I steamer SS Mantola were discovered in the North Atlantic last year.

Both of the vessels - found 100 miles apart - were sunk by German U-Boats.

Emotional wreck: Neil Cunningham-Dobson, 55, said all he could think of was his father's experiences at sea as he discovered the sunk World War II vessel SS Gairsoppa

Mr Cunningham-Dobson's employers Odyssey Marine Exploration will be able to keep 80 per cent of the silver once they have recovered it.

He said as his team found the SS Gairsoppa last September, all he could think about was his father who served on a similar ship during WWII.

The vessel had an estimated £150million worth of silver bullion on board while the SS Mantola has a haul thought to be worth £12million.

Mr Cunningham-Dobson said today: 'When the wreck of the Gairsoppa came 
into view for the first time, three miles down, I couldn't help but 
think of my late father, Norman.

'He was a radio operator in World War 
II. He served with the British-India Steam Navigation Company on ships 
similar to the Gairsoppa.

'So for me it was like looking back at my father - a special moment.'

Precious cargo: The SS Mantola, which was sunk by a German submarine in 1917 in the North Atlantic, carrying silver

Weeks later the same company discovered the SS Mantola around 100 miles away that sank on February 9, 1917. 

Neil, who is Odyssey's chief marine archaeologist, will start the missions to recover the sunken treasure troves next month.

He said the biggest challenge in 
recovering the fortune is that it is at the bottom of the North Atlantic
- three times deeper than the watery grave of the Titanic.

Heroic: Second Officer Richard Ayres, the only survivor of the SS Gairsoppa

'To extract the treasure you 
are sending down specialised instruments a length equivalent to three 
times that of the Tay Road Bridge, to accurately remove from a hold the 
size of a back garden,' he said.

The SS Mantola was insured to carry 
silver worth £110,000 when it sailed in 1917. That value would mean the 
ship could hold as much as 600,000 ounces of silver, based on silver 
prices at the time.

But the haul is small compared to 
what is thought to be on board the SS Garisoppa - it sank in 1941 
carrying a reported cargo of up to 7 million ounces of silver.

The Gairsoppa was steaming home from 
India while in the service of the Ministry of War Transport when she was
torpedoed by a Nazi U-boat.

She sank in icy seas more than three 
miles deep about 300 miles south west of Ireland. Only one of her 84 
crew - Second Officer Richard Ayres - survived.

The 412-ft steamship is sitting upright on the seabed, with its holds open.

Odyssey said last September a robot 
submersible captured video footage showing tea chests, a sign that the 
heavier consignment of silver was underneath.

The ship, recognisable by the 
red-and-black paintwork of the British-India Steam Navigation Company 
and the torpedo hole in its side, was sailing in a convoy from Calcutta 
in 1941.

Buffeted by high winds and running 
low on coal, the captain decided he would not make it to Liverpool and 
broke from the convoy to head for Galway.

A single torpedo from U-101 sank her 
in 20 minutes, on February 17, 1941. Three lifeboats were launched, but 
only Second Officer Richard Ayres made it to land, reaching the Cornish 
coast after 13 days.

Well preserved: A brass part of the Gairsoppa is
in good condition, suggesting that the cargo is also undamaged by its 
time beneath the waves
