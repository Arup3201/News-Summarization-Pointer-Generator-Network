A family dog mauled its owners' two-month-old baby to death after attacking the boy while he was in his uncle's arms.

Authorities in south-eastern Michigan said the dog, a Catahoula hound,  jumped on the family's couch and tore into the boy's head and throat.

The attack happened late on Sunday morning at a home in Springfield Township, about 30 miles north-west of Detroit.

Police were called to a house in south-eastern Michigan after a dog mauled a two-month-old baby boy to death

The dog was a three-year-old female Catahoula hound (similar to the one pictured) that the family had owned for about two years

The child's 18-year-old uncle was holding the baby on the couch at the time.

He pushed the dog off, but it jumped back on and attacked the boy again, sheriff Michael Bouchard told WDIV-TV.

There was no negligence by the adults involved, who had no reason to think the dog would attack the baby unprovoked, Bouchard added.

'It just turned and grabbed the baby,' the sheriff said. 'Who knows how much of this is instinctual, who knows how much territorial?'

The infant's 26-year-old father was injured while prying open the dog's jaws, Bouchard said.

'He did everything he could to get the dog off of the baby, so much so that he's going to need stitches in his arms,' Bouchard said.

Springfield Township's Sheriff Mike Bouchard said the dog jumped on the couch and tore into the boy's head and throat

The boy was taken to Genesys Regional Medical Center before being airlifted to William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, where he died, authorities said.

'This is a tragic incident, and it is a sad reminder to keep animals away from small children and babies no matter what the circumstances may be,' the sheriff told the station.

'Animal behavior, whether intended as playful or territorial, can have devastating impact on small children.'

MailOnline has tried to contact the sheriff's office for more details.

Authorities said they planned to euthanize the dog, a three-year-old female Catahoula hound that the family had owned for about two years.

Several months ago the dog bit a neighbor but didn't draw blood, it was reported.

The dogs can reach weights between 40 and 90lbs. The breed, named after Louisiana's Catahoula Parish, traditionally has been used in boar hunting.
