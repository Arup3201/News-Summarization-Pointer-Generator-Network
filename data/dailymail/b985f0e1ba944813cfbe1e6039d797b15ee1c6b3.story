A bus driver who spends every day behind the wheel is unable to drive his own car - because he can't afford the insurance.

Tim Clarke, 19, has a clean driving licence and thousands of hours of driving experience under his belt.

But Mr Clarke claims he is one of many young drivers being forced off the road by 'astronomical' insurance fees after he was quoted up to £5,000 to insure a car.

Young driver: Tim Clarke, 19, works as a qualified bus driver but is still being quoted between £3,000 to £5,000 to ensure a 1.3 Suzuki Jimny because of his 'lack of road experience'

Unlike most drivers his age, he has passed an independent bus driving test and has a Certificate of Professional Competence, but he says insurers don't take that into consideration.

When he tried to insure a Suzuki Jimny 1.3, he was quoted between £3,000 and £5000 - the same price as the car he hopes to buy.

Direct Line refused to insure him at all because of his lack of road experience.

Mr Clarke, who lives with his parents in Droylsden, said: 'I earn £15,000 a year, so I just can't afford that on top of everything else.

'It feels like they need to start taking into account driving qualifications and skills and not just look at your age and think "this guy's going to be a delinquent teenager and we've got to hike up the price for him".

Off the road: Tim Clarke says he can't afford to pay the high insurance costs and will wait until he has had his licence for longer before reapplying

'I have to rely on my parents to take me everywhere - or get the bus.'

Mr Clarke started his job in January, driving 26 different routes across north Manchester.

He added: 'I'm definitely better than most drivers, but they just look at the statistics.

'I'm going to wait until I've had my licence for a year and try again, but I shouldn't have to do that.'

Vicky Tomlinson, Mr Clarke's manager at the First bus depot in Manchester said: 'Tim is one of more than 1,500 highly trained bus drivers serving in the communities of Greater Manchester.

Like all our drivers, Tim has gone through a six-week training programme covering driving and customer service and we're pleased with the way he has taken to the role.'

A spokesman for Direct Line said: 'Young drivers make up only eight per cent of licence holders, but are involved in 25 per cent of road deaths and serious injuries.

'This is the primary reason why young drivers have always paid higher car insurance premiums. For the average driver, around 20 different rating factors are used to determine their individual price for car insurance.

'The most influential of these are: age, driving experience, postcode, No Claims Discount, a driver's previous claims history and if they have any driving convictions.

'Even if a young person drives for their job and has less than a year's experience, they will still be determined as a higher risk than an older driver.'
