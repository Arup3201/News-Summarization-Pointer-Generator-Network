With his majestic headdress and fearsome warpaint, Ed Winddancer appears to be carrying on the proud traditions of his Native American ancestors - but according to a long-standing enemy, he is nothing but a fraud in feathers. 

Winddancer, 55, traces his roots to the Nanticoke and Cherokee tribes, and often appears in full  dress at heritage festivals to play the flute, regaling crowds with ancient stories. He sells CDs of his music through his MySpace page.

However his performances are now often accompanied by the  presence of Sal Serbin, 48, who has taken to appearing at Winddancer's gigs holding up signs reading 'Liar' and 'Cultural Thief'.

Tribal calling: Ed Winddancer, 55, from Florida, has caused outrage among the Native American community who declared him a fraud and his practices 'dangerous'

Mr Serbin, from Sarasota, Florida, claims that not only is Winddancer a fraud - but his practices are downright dangerous. 

He told the Herald-Tribune: 'Our ancestors fought and died to 
preserve and protect our culture, not for these people to wake up one 
day, put some feathers in their hair and decide to be Indian.

'It would dishonor my ancestors if I didn't get out there and do 
something.'

Mr Serbin, has Sioux lineage and says his grandfather fought in the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876. He said that Winddancer is not alone in his allegedly false claims to be Native American - which is against federal law.

Full regalia: Mr Winddancer, 55, performs at the Sarasota Native American Indian Festival in Florida

Mr Serbin had planned to attend the fourth annual Sarasota Indian Festival this weekend in Florida, which he believes is one of the true Native American gatherings.

The festival features Rick Bird and the Bird Choppers from Cherokee, North Carolina performing traditional drumming and dance along with craftsmen making authentic bead work, jewellery and sculptures. It is hosted by Rex Begaye, a full-blooded Navajo and Sarasota resident.

Protest: Sal Serbin travels up and down Florida outing those who he believes to be fake Native Americans

Mr Winddancer, who also lives in Florida, has not been invited to attend. 

Mr Serbin, who is a fully fledged member of the Assiniboine Tribe was born on a reservation in Montana. He is married with three children and has lived in Florida for the past 13 years.

He is not only angered by Winddancer's 
allegedly false practices but worried that they may be placing people in
danger. One ceremony called the Sun Dance, involves a bone being 
pierced through a person's chest and tied to a tree, with the individual
moving around until the skin breaks from the bone.

He told the Herald-Tribune: 'People are dying from those. It just hasn't gotten a lot of publicity. There's some in Florida.'

Mr Serbin travels the state to try to prevent people who he believes to be fraudulent Native Americans from performing rituals.

The legitimacy of Ed Winddancer's 
heritage is debatable. 

He was born  Edward Arthur Pielert III in Maryland in 1956 and claims that his mother was of Nanticoke descent, his father of Cherokee. 

He legally changed his name in 1992 and tours the
country, performing his music and dancing at schools and festivals.

Mr Winddancer believes that Mr Serbin's vendetta against him is 'racist'.

He said: 'It's racism. What else would you call it? I'm not Indian enough for Sal? Then it's an issue of race.'
