A transgender man has won £1,500 in compensation from a nightclub after he was thrown out of the men's toilets and ordered to use the disabled facilities instead.

Kay Browning used to be a woman but is now a man, and was kicked out of the male toilets while out celebrating a friend's birthday at Remedies nightclub in Tiverton, Devon.

The 24-year-old left the nightclub shocked and embarrassed, and said he feels he is 'constantly judged' because he is transgender.

Kay Browning has been awarded £1,500 in compensation from Remedies bar in Tiverton after the transgender 24-year-old was thrown out of the men's toilets and ordered to use the disabled facilities instead 

Shortly after the incident last year he began pursuing legal action and has now reached an out-of-court settlement of £1,500 with the venue - and the agreement that he can use the male toilets any time he pleases.

It's offensive on many levels,' he said. 

'It ruined my night so I left without saying goodbye to my friends.

'I am constantly judged because I am transgender. Enough is enough. I hope I've made a stand for transculture.

'I would have been much happier if this sort of thing didn't happen in the first place but I'm relieved it's all been settled professionally.'

At the time of the incident he said: 'I was so embarrassed. I don't know if another punter had said something, but I was in the toilets and a bouncer asked me to leave and use the disabled one instead. He made me feel like a freak.

The 24-year-old said he feels he is constantly judged because he is transgender and was left embarrassed 

Mr Browning (left) said he only got the confidence to go through sex change treatment after he was born a girl (right) with the support of his younger sister, Kelly, after he was bullied at school 

'If someone genuinely identifies as a man, people need to treat them like a man. That's just a matter of respect.

'We are the only minority still striving for equality and there are a lot of haters out there.People still make insulting comments and say I'm 'scared to be a girl'. 

'That's just ignorant.'

Mr Browning has starred in documentaries, been on the Jeremy Kyle show, and has started hosting events to raise awareness of lesbian, gay and transgender issues.

Kay Browning has spoken about the problems he encountered in school as a transgender man 

He has previously spoken about his struggle with being transgender and revealed he was picked on for wearing boyish baggy clothes, tying his hair back and refusing to wear any make-up.

It led to him being labelled a lesbian by classmates, which confused and unsure, the teenager assumed must be true.

But at the age of 14 Mr Browning spoke to a teacher and realised he was transgender and began dressing as a male, and shaved his hair. 

The 24-year-old said last year that he had finally got the confidence to go through with gender reassignment surgery following the support of his younger sister Kelly. 

He said he would like to 'shake hands' with the owners of Remedies and start again.

He added: 'It's in my nature to forgive - they didn't understand me but I want to be the bigger person and I want them to move with the times.

'It's not the easiest place to be transgender, but I have made massive changes.

'I had a letter from a boy who said when he told his dad he was a transsexual he wouldn't speak to him - but after watching me on Jeremy Kyle he changed his mind.'

Alec Carter, director of Greendale Leisure Ltd, said: 'Remedies Tiverton is operated by a great team and with the training they have received and listening to our customers they are better place then ever to provide a safe enjoyable venue for all.

'I am pleased that past matters have been resolved and I wish Kay every success and happiness in the future.'
