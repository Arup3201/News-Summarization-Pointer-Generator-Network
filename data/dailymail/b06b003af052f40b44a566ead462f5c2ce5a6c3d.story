Scientists have revealed the most detailed map of the early universe ever created.

Captured by the European Space Agency Planck satellite, it shows the split
 second after the Big Bang - and indicates the universe is 80 million years 
older that scientists had thought.

Planck's portrait shows the oldest light in our Universe, imprinted on the 
sky when it was just 380,000 years old.

The most detailed map of the universe ever created - based on the initial 15.5 months of data from Planck and is the mission¿s first all-sky picture of the oldest light in our Universe, imprinted on the sky when it was just 380 000 years old

Planck’s
 primary goal is to observe the Cosmic Microwave Background, the relic 
radiation from the Big Bang, and to extract its encoded information 
about what our universe is made of, and the origin of its structure.

This
 relic radiation can only be reached once all sources of foreground 
emission, such as the galactic haze and the carbon monoxide signals, 
have been identified and removed.

The latest image shows oldest light in our Universe, imprinted on the 
sky when it was just 380,000 years old.

The image is based on 
the initial 15.5 months of data from the £515m Planck space telescope.

'The extraordinary
 quality of Planck’s portrait of the infant Universe allows us to peel 
back its layers to the very foundations, revealing that our blueprint of
 the cosmos is far from complete,' said says Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA’s Director General.

Planck data also set a new value for the rate at which the Universe is expanding today, implying that the age of the Universe is 13.82 billion years - 80 million years older than previously thought.

The findings bolster a key theory 
called inflation, which says the universe burst from subatomic size to 
its now-observable expanse in a fraction of a second. 

George Esfthathiou, an astrophysicist 
who announced the Planck satellite mapping on Thursday, says the 
findings also offer new specificity of the universe's composition.

'To a cosmologist, this map is a gold mine of information,'he said.

He says it is made up of slightly more ordinary matter and less of the mysterious dark matter and dark energy.

'Since
 the release of Planck’s first all-sky image in 2010, we have been 
carefully extracting and analysing all of the foreground emissions that 
lie between us and the Universe’s first light, revealing the cosmic 
microwave background in the greatest detail yet,' said George Efstathiou
 of the University of Cambridge, UK.

The image is based on 
the initial 15.5 months of data from Planck and is the mission’s first 
all-sky picture of the oldest light in our Universe, imprinted on the 
sky when it was just 380 000 years old.

At that time, the young 
Universe was filled with a hot dense soup of interacting protons, 
electrons and photons at about 2700ºC.

When the protons and electrons joined to form hydrogen atoms, the light was set free.

As the Universe has expanded, this 
light today has been stretched out to microwave wavelengths, equivalent 
to a temperature of just 2.7 degrees above absolute zero.

The new 'recipe for the universe': Planck's high-precision cosmic microwave background map has allowed scientists to extract the most refined values yet of the Universe¿s ingredients.

This 
‘cosmic microwave background’ – CMB – shows tiny temperature 
fluctuations that correspond to regions of slightly different densities 
at very early times, representing the seeds of all future structure: the
 stars and galaxies of today.

According to the standard model of 
cosmology, the fluctuations arose immediately after the Big Bang and 
were stretched to cosmologically large scales during a brief period of 
accelerated expansion known as inflation.

Planck was designed to 
map these fluctuations across the whole sky with greater resolution and 
sensitivity than ever before.

By analysing the nature and distribution 
of the seeds in Planck’s CMB image, we can determine the composition and
 evolution of the Universe from its birth to the present day.

Overall,
 the information extracted from Planck’s new map provides an excellent 
confirmation of the standard model of cosmology at an unprecedented 
accuracy, the researchers say.

But because precision of Planck’s map is so high, it 
also made it possible to reveal some peculiar unexplained features that 
may well require new physics to be understood.

One of the most surprising 
findings is an asymmetry in the average temperatures on opposite hemispheres of the sky.

This runs counter to the prediction made by the standard model that the Universe should be broadly similar in any direction we look.

Furthermore, a cold spot extends over a patch of sky that is much larger than expected.

The asymmetry and the cold spot had already been hinted at with Planck’s predecessor, NASA’s WMAP mission, but were largely ignored because of lingering doubts about their cosmic origin

'The fact that Planck has made such a significant detection of these anomalies erases any doubts about their reality; it can no longer be said that they are artefacts of the measurements.

'They are real and we have to look for a credible explanation,' says Paolo Natoli of the University of Ferrara, Italy.

'Imagine investigating the foundations of a house and finding that parts of them are weak. You might not know whether the weaknesses will eventually topple the house, but you’d probably start looking for ways to reinforce it pretty quickly all the same,' adds François Bouchet of the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris.

One way to explain the anomalies is to propose that the Universe is in fact not the same in all directions on a larger scale than we can observe, ESA said.

In this scenario, the light rays from the CMB may have taken a more complicated route through the Universe than previously understood, resulting in some of the unusual patterns observed today.

The results show a cold spot extends over a patch of sky that is much larger than expected, challenging theories of the symmetry of the universe

'Our ultimate goal would be to construct a new model that predicts the anomalies and links them together.

'But these are early days; so far, we don’t know whether this is possible and what type of new physics might be needed - and that’s exciting,' says Professor Efstathiou.

Beyond the anomalies, however, the Planck data conform spectacularly well to the expectations of a rather simple model of the Universe, allowing scientists to extract the most refined values yet for its ingredients.

Normal matter that makes up stars and galaxies contributes just 4.9% of the mass/energy density of the Universe. Dark matter, which has thus far only been detected indirectly by its gravitational influence, makes up 26.8%, nearly a fifth more than the previous estimate.

Conversely, dark energy, a mysterious force thought to be responsible for accelerating the expansion of the Universe, accounts for less than previously thought.

'With the most accurate and detailed maps of the microwave sky ever made, Planck is painting a new picture of the Universe that is pushing us to the limits of understanding current cosmological theories,” says Jan Tauber, ESA’s Planck Project Scientist.

'We see an almost perfect fit to the standard model of cosmology, but with intriguing features that force us to rethink some of our basic assumptions.

'This is the beginning of a new journey and we expect that our continued analysis of Planck data will help shed light on this conundrum.'
