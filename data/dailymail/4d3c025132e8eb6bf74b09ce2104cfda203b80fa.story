A police commissioner is facing an investigation for running a private security firm on the side, prompting accusations of a conflict of interest.

Kevin Hurley, an ex-Scotland Yard commander, is still advertising his company’s services online with his personal mobile phone number – even though he is now responsible for governing Surrey Police, for which he is paid £70,000 a year.

Inspirational Security Solutions boasts that it provides safety advice and training in undercover investigations, and that its executives are ‘politically aware’. Mr Hurley has also caused controversy by appointing a former colleague in the Met as his £50,000-a-year deputy.

Kevin Hurley was a commander at Scotland Yard and is now police commissioner for Surrey but he is being accused of having a conflict of interest over his role as a director of a private security firm

He has declared his business interests online but critics insist his  second job clashes with his public role. He has the power to give contracts to his own firm or other private investigators and could share his unrivalled knowledge of force finances with business clients.

It will raise fresh fears over the powers of Police and Crime Commissioners, elected last November in a bid to make forces more accountable. As The Mail on Sunday has disclosed, many have appointed friends and political cronies to well-paid posts without advertising them.

Mr Hurley’s private security interests will now be investigated by the official group that scrutinises his actions, the Police and Crime Panel for Surrey.

Its chairman, Councillor Dorothy Ross-Tomlin, said last night: ‘I have asked our officers to look into the rules around interests.’ A spokesman for Mr Hurley said: ‘Kevin remains the unremunerated Director of Inspirational Security Solutions Ltd. The company has not been closed, but has not generated any income since the election. The company has never worked for Surrey Police.’

Shamed: Paris Brown quit over Twitter slurs

Police have defended their investigation into shamed youth crime commissioner Paris Brown over remarks she made on Twitter.

She was forced to quit  her £15,000-a-year taxpayer-funded job two days after  The Mail on Sunday revealed she had used homophobic and racist terms to refer to gays and travellers.

The 17-year-old was visited at her family home by two officers before being asked to surrender her mobile phone. She was later interviewed under caution at a police station. Her lawyers have written to Kent Police, saying the nature of its investigation was ‘wholly disproportionate’.

A police spokesman said: ‘We received more than 50 complaints from members  of the public and are investigating to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed in relation to this incident.’
