Mats Hummels sounded a warning to the rest of the World Cup as Germany became the first team in history to reach four straight semi-finals.

The central defender soared to down feeble France in Rio de Janeiro and grab his second goal of the tournament.

And Hummels insisted afterwards that Germany are ready to go two steps further than they have in their recent history and claim the trophy back here in eight days' time.

'This is the next dream to have become a reality here in Brazil. I hope it's not the last either,' said Hummels, whose early header was the difference between the sides as the quarter-final failed to live up to expectations.

'We’re playing the kind of football that will give us a chance to win this trophy. We’re defending well, with passion and determination, so that needs to be stepped up with each game.'

The Germans had suffered a virus in 
their camp going into the game which laid seven players, but although 
they managed only three attempts on goal they were still well organised 
enough to make France look the more sluggish side.

Philipp Lahm said: ‘We are in the semi-finals so who cares about anything else? It wasn’t easy, but we worked as a team and the team always comes first.'

Hummels was one of a number of changes to the Germans' starting line-up that paid off handsomely for manager Joachim Low.

On the back of an extra-time marathon against Algeria in the last 16 and battling a flu outbreak in the panel, Löw was elated with how his reconfigured team coped in the intense afternoon heat.

'What we saw today was players who were injured who had to go all the way to their limits. Remember the Algeria match where we went to extra time,' said Löw, who now faces a dilemma over whether to stick with his new-look side for Tuesday's semi-final.

'Now it's a matter of bringing all our forces together to see if they can recover and regenerate well. It's about seeing how the players cope with this match. Then we will make a decision.'

Defeated France manager Didier Deschamps lamented his side's failure to truly get to grips with the Germans. In spite of creating a host of openings, at no stage in the second-half did they mount a concerted onslaught on a German defence that still shows signs of weakness.

'It's difficult to console my team and my players. They have taken a great experience, but we just weren't effective today,' said Deschamps afterwards.

'We confronted a superior side that plays at a very high level. I believe that there is not that big a difference between us and Germany. But this German side has more experience than us and they are more accustomed to playing these occasions.

'There is still a lot of work to do with this team but I’m very pleased. Let’s not forget what we’ve done so far which is good, but, I wanted to reach the semi-finals.'
