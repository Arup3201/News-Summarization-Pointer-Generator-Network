The Mandarin in charge of selecting honours has revealed that rules limiting the number of sporting gongs will be torn up as a result of the London Olympics.

Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the civil service, has let it be known that gold medallists who deserve recognition will get rewarded in the New Year's Honours list, regardless of how many of them there are.

A public row has erupted after it emerged that David Cameron ordered the rules changed earlier this year to remove the automatic right of Olympic champions to an honour.

Under the new guidelines, honours will go to gold medallists who have shown years of dedication and have used their public profile to 'give back to society'.

But the Cabinet Office flatly denied claims yesterday that a strict quota system would mean more senior mandarins would win knighthoods than sportsmen.

Instead, senior officials made clear the rulebook will be ignored this year to ensure maximum recognition for the heroes of London 2012.

Sir Bob's official spokesman told the Mail: 'The stuff set out in the report are prely guidelines. Obviously this is an Olympic year and we have seen some amazing performances.

'The whole point of the honours system is that they are given on merit. If you have a rigid quota system it destroys the entire principles of the honours system.

'If there are more people worthy of an honour in a year like this then that will be reflected in the honours. If people deserve it they should receive it.'

The spokesman stopped short of confirming that every gold medallist will get a gong, but Whitehall officials have said it is 'highly likely' that every gold medallist who does not already have an MBE or better is expected to receive one.

Sir Bob's aides intervened after the Mail revealed yesterday that both David Cameron and and Lord Coe - the mastermind of the games - also privately back the call for all gold medallists to be rewarded.

The call is also backed by London Mayor Boris Johnson, four time gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent and Lord Moynihan, the outgoing chairman of the British Olympic Association.

The BOA is expected to nominate all 43 gold Olympic gold medallists and those from the Paralympic Games, which begin next week.

Senior Whitehall officials pointed out that there are likely to be at least three Olympic knights in the New Year's Honours.

Bradley Wiggins, the first British winner of the Tour de France winner who won his fourth Olympic gold this year, Dave Braislford -- who masterminded Team GB and Team Sky's cycling successes - and four-time Olympic champion sailor Ben Ainslie all have CBEs already.

That means the only honour they could receive is a knighthood.
