Moors Murderer Ian Brady's desperate wish to die moved closer today after he signed a legally-binding document demanding he must not be resuscitated should he fall gravely ill.

The killer has tried to starve himself to death for 13 years and has now started the process to block any doctors helping him if he is close to death.

In a shocking twist, if his demand is agreed but medical staff keep him alive, he could sue for damages and receive a taxpayer-funded payout. 

Brady, who was 75 on January 2, is trying to hand Power of Attorney to his mental health advocate Jackie Powell, 49, who would then enforce his death wish.

'In no circumstances does he want drugs or any treatment including oxygen or resuscitation,' she told The Sun.

'In effect, Ian Brady has signed a living will. If he is unconscious and I am approached as his Lasting Power of Attorney, my instructions are that he must be allowed to die.

'If they were to ignore his wishes he could sue them'.

Last July Brady was furious after he collapsed and stopped breathing following a seizure but doctors resuscitated him.

The 75-year-old suffers from a degenerative spine condition and fractured two 
vertebrae in the fall. He was transferred from Ashworth Hospital to the University 
Hospital Aintree, six miles away. Brady spent two nights in a private 
room before being driven back to Ashworth.

He has been held at the secure hospital – at an estimated cost of £7.3million – since 1985.

The Office of the Public Guardian will now consider his application, a process which will take six weeks.

Known as an advanced decision, they are usually legally binding but 
can be overturned if you have appointed an unsuitable power of attorney,
you do not have the mental capacity to make the decision or have been 
unduly influenced to make it.

Never found: Keith Bennett, 12, has never been found on the moors and Brady handed a letter to his advocate that could have revealed his whereabouts

Brady is also going to a mental health tribunal in June to demand another way to die.

He has been on hunger strike since 1999 and wants to be moved from 
Ashworth psychiatric hospital to a Scottish prison so the authorities 
will no longer have the power to force-feed him and he can starve 
himself to death.

He is sectioned under the Mental Health Act, which means doctors can intervene to keep him alive and may scupper his non-resuscitation order.

Brady and Myra Hindley murdered five youngsters in the 1960s, sexually 
torturing their victims before burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor 
near Oldham.

They were jailed for life in 1966 over the murders of Lesley Ann Downey, ten, John Kilbride, 12, and Edward Evans, 17.

They did not admit to killing Keith Johnson  and another victim, Pauline Reade, 16, until 1987 Hindley died in prison in 2002, aged 60.

His confidante Jackie Powell was arrested last summer on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of a body after becoming embroiled in controversy following her participation in a Channel 4 documentary, Endgames Of A Psychopath.

On camera, Miss Powell said Brady had given her a sealed envelope to be opened after his death, which would ‘allow [Keith’s mother] Winnie Johnson to find peace’.

She speculated that the contents might reveal the location of 12-year-old Keith’s body on Saddleworth Moor, which overlooks Oldham.

But Winnie died in August aged 78, still not knowing where her son's body was, 48 years on.
