Even though he seems to have found love in the arms of model Chantel Jeffries, Justin Bieber won't be having a sweet Valentine's Day this year.

MailOnline has learned exclusively the Baby singer is scheduled to be arraigned on that very holiday for his Thursday arrest in Miami, Florida that included a DUI, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license.

Meanwhile, the 19-year-old has been looking like he doesn't have a care in the world as he frolicks on a beach in Panama with his entourage.

Life in the fast lane: Justin Bieber, seen here on Monday in Panama, will be arraigned for his DUI in Miami on Valentine's Day

'Justin will be arraigned on February 14 at 9 am,' a source told MailOnline exclusively.

'He will have to meet with judge William Altfield. There is already a courtroom assigned to his case.'

Justin already has an attorney, Roy Black, working on his behalf.

'Justin doesn't have to be there,' Ed Griffith, a Miami state attorney's office spokesman, told People. 'He will plead non guilty and the process will begin.'

The Beauty And A Beat singer was arrested in the early morning hours of Thursday in the Miami Beach area after visiting the club SET with his father Jeremy, 38, rapper Khalil Sharief and model Chantel, aged 21.

Police noticed Bieber when a street had been closed off for him by friends to make room for a drag race with Khalil.

The star was pulled over in his rented yellow Lamborghini and dropped several F-bombs after being asked to get out of his car and put his hands on his vehicle.

In trouble: It was not even a week ago when the Baby singer had his mug shot taken and was released on $2,500 bail

The police officer had noted in his report that he smelled alcohol coming from the performer.

That has now been the subject of a new debate, according to TMZ, because the singer admitted he had only one beer and the BAC level he was tested at came back at only .014, not the original .04 he was believed to have blown.

Either way, the officer did note that Bieber was not fit to drive. The star did admit to smoking marijuana and taking prescription pills, which could have hindered his ability to operate a vehicle.

His friend Khalil had a zero BAC level but was still arrested for a DUI, according to a Monday report from TMZ. But the Def Jam rapper could have been under the influence of something else such as marijuana or pills, the site notes.

Musician Jermaine Dupri told TMZ on Tuesday he was also pulled over by Miami police in December after he left a club. The star explained this happens because 'nine times outta 10 they gonna find something' and suggested Bieber was too flashy on Thursday in his expensive sports car, calling unnecessary attention to himself.

Having his arraignment fall on Valentine's Day might be uncomfortable for the singer, who will no doubt be feeling a storm of emotions on the romantic holiday.

In early January he was seen with his on-again, off-again love interest of two years Selena Gomez.

He has since been spotted with Chantel, who Page Six reported on Monday was hoping to sell her story to outlets such as Good Morning American and Inside Edition about the night of Bieber's arrest.

The model was looking to get five figures for her exclusive, but she bowed out of any negotiations after Justin whisked her off to Panama.

'She hired an attorney and was negotiating a deal with the weekly magazines and the big TV shows,' a source told the site.

'She wanted $20,000 plus a guaranteed mention of her modeling career.'

Adding to his drama, MailOnline has reported the management team of the Believe star is interested in an intervention and sending him to rehab.

His manager Scooter Braun is especially keen to get the star help.

What a mess: Bieber and Jeffries in the rented Lamborghini just before his arrest on Thursday in Miami

On Tuesday RadarOnline reported Lucian Grainge, the CEO of Universal Music Group, Bieber's label, said during a Grammy party that the performer 'needs an intervention' soon.

'I’m very concerned about him - I’ve been concerned about him for many months, and [Bieber's manager] Scooter, who I work with very closely... is with him at the moment,' Grainge said.

'Hopefully, we will all get through to him.... All of us around him need to take all the responsibility, all the pressure off him and give him support so he can address the issues he has - and he does have issues. And I’d like it to be dealt with.'

The All That Matters singer reportedly was confronted by Braun, his mother Pattie Mallette and mentor Usher while in Panama.

Bieber may have bigger problems than his public image.

On Tuesday CNN reported his DUI could lead to deportation back to Canada.

There is already a petition on We The People to have the White House kick the star out of the US. As of Monday there were 40,000 signatures.

Also on Tuesday, R&B singer Brian McKnight, aged 44, told BANG Showbiz he believes Justin's wild antics are part of a plan to get people even more interested in his music.

The My Kind of Girl singer - who has worked with top music stars such as Mariah Carey, Justin Timberlake, Nelly and Christina Aguilera - said: 'I think that the mere fact that everyone is talking about Justin, and Miley Cyrus, now shows that they know exactly what they're doing.'

He added: 'In this day and age there really isn't bad publicity, no matter what has happened. With what's happened with Justin these past few weeks he's probably got a new record that's about to come out, I would almost bet my life.'

UsWeekly reported on Tuesday the MTV favorite was filming a music video in Panama, most likely for his new song Confident. In photos, he can be seen singing and gesturing while a camera man recorded his moves. Bieber promised to release a new video this week.

'He's got to do something to drum up interest in him so if that means going and getting arrested, or egging his neighbour's house he does whatever it takes,' added Brian.

Police visited the Canadian's home in January to investigate an alleged egging of a neighbor's house in his Calabasas gated community called the Oaks, which resulted in the arrest of the star's friend Lil Za.

On Monday Detective David Thompson of the Los Angeles Police Department told the New York Daily News he was still going to present a case to prosecutors even though no evidence has been unearthed in the felony vandalism case where $20,000 worth of damage was caused.

Although Brian thinks Justin's behavior will work for him while he's young, he isn't sure if he can continue it when he reaches his 30s.

'At the end of the day, at least he's got the talent to back up his shenanigans, so I think it's a good formula for him,' McKnight added,

'With the exception of One Direction, he doesn't really have any competition, he's the only game in town.

'My only question is, "What do you do next?" If you're always trying to top yourself, and it's not musically topping yourself, what do you do at 30? Well he'd probably say, "I'll be so rich at that point it won't matter,"' McKnight said.
