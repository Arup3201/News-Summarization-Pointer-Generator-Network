A pilot was killed during a Long Island plane crash that nearly took the lives of woman and her baby.

The crash took place at 9:20am in East Patchogue on Camille Lane, FAA officials said.

The woman's husband, Marcus Wilson, told radio station 1010WINS that his wife rushed to save their baby after the plane crashed into the family's yard.

'She was in the shower, and all she heard was something [...] something coming around,' he said. 'And she looked out the window, she ran in the back, got the baby and then it started exploding.'

'Yes, everybody's happy to be alive,' he also said. 1010WINS reported both the Wilsons' pool and the plane were totaled.

Suffolk County authorities said in a statement the pilot's name has been 'withheld pending notification of next of kin.'

FAA officials have said that the pilot was the only person on the plane.

The Columbia Lancair LC-41 plane took off from Republic Airport in Farmingdale, FAA officials said, and was traveling toward MacArthurt Airport in Islip when the plane crashed.

Witness Tara Wildman described the crash to the New York Post.

'I heard a very low flying plane. You could really hear the engine,' she told the paper. 'Then I heard an explosion. I ran out and saw the the huge mushroom cloud.'

'That pilot was a hero in my book,' Wildman added. 'He avoided two houses and an oil tank and landed on an inflatable pool in the back yard.'

The National Transportation Safety Board announced on Twitter that it is investigating the incident.
