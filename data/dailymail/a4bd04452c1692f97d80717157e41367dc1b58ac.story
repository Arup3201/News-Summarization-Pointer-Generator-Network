The man leading the hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has revealed search experts are considering 1,000 possible paths it could have taken.

Martin 
Dolan of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said his team were faced with an 'intimidating' and 'unprecedented' challenge as they prepare to launch a year-long off shore search for the missing craft.

The
 aircraft vanished on March 8 with 239 passengers and crew on board 
after it departed Kuala Lumpar in Malaysia to Beijing in China.

The man leading the hunt for the missing 
Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 has revealed search experts are 
considering 1,000 possible paths it could have taken.

The Australian government has released an updated map showing the new, smaller search area for MH370

Over
 the past six months, international experts searched for the aircraft 
using a range of data in a bid to narrow down the crash site.

Mr Dolan told the Telegraph that a 'reasonably clear picture' of 
the plane's trajectory was emerging, even if there were 
still approximately 1,000 possible paths it could have taken.

He said: 'There is an infinite possible number of tracks that
 the aircraft could have flown along, but for practical purposes there 
are about 1,000... from the point of its turning south.'

Extensive
 aerial searches failed to spot any wreckage from the airliner, but 
experts have studied radar and satellite data in a bid to close in on 
the crash site. 

Mr Dolan 
said new seabed surveys have also produced some interesting findings 
including hard objects that seem inconsistent with their surroundings, 
although there is no guarantee that this is the aircraft. 

He told The Times: ' There is nothing that has screamed out and said "I look like an aircraft". 

'It's still a hell of an area. The area is horribly, horribly complicated.'

Experts have spent the past six months remapping large areas of the sea floor to facilitate the search 

Australian deputy PM Warren Truss, right, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Malaysian transport minister Dato' Seri Liow Tiong Lai in Canberra to agree to fund the renewed search 

Mr Dolan earlier wrote on his blog that the new search will concentrate on a 60,000 square kilometre area of the southern Indian Ocean.  

'The complexities surrounding the search cannot be understated. It involves vast areas of the Indian Ocean with only limited known data and aircraft flight information.

'While it is impossible to determine with certainty where the aircraft may have entered the water, all the available data indicates a highly probable search area close to a long but narrow arc of the southern Indian Ocean.

'The search will be a major undertaking. The complexities and challenges involved are immense, but not impossible.

'The best minds from around the world have been reviewing, refining and localising the most likely area where the aircraft entered the water, which is why we remain confident of finding the aircraft.'

Last month the Malaysian and Australian governments signed a memorandum of understanding where they both agreed to fund the renewed search effort.
