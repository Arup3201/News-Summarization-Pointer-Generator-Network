The world’s most powerful investment bank was last night accused of being ‘oblivious’ to public opinion after paying its staff almost a quarter of a million pounds last year on average.

Goldman Sachs yesterday cemented its position as the world’s most generous big bank, dishing out £8.4billion in pay and perks for 2014.

The Wall Street giant, which employs 6,000 people in London, confirmed its 34,000 staff around the world received an average package of £246,000.

Astonishingly, the sum – which is almost ten times the average salary in the UK and dwarfs the Prime Minister’s £142,500 package – represents a small pay cut.

Staff received £248,000 on average in 2013. The figure includes salary, bonuses and benefits, including healthcare and pensions.

The announcement came as Goldman revealed its profits rose 5pc last year to £5.6billion.

Goldman is set to confirm multi million pound bonuses for top executives, including boss Lloyd Blankfein and UK supremo Michael Sherwood, in separate filings to US regulators next week.

Deborah Hargreaves, boss of campaign group the High Pay Centre said: ‘This is a further sign that the banking industry - and particularly Goldman Sachs - is completely oblivious to public opinion about bonuses and believes the only way to reward employees is through money.’

Banks on both sides of the Atlantic have been criticised for continuing to award eye watering sums to its staff, despite evidence that the bonus culture encouraged the reckless behaviour which helped to trigger the financial crisis.

But Goldman has earned itself the nickname ‘Goldmine Sacks’ for consistently paying more than its rivals as it has consolidated its position as the most powerful investment bank in the world.

Just before New Year it sneaked out details of a £367million pay bonanza for its top London staff for 2013.

The huge sum was shared between 121 Goldman Sachs bosses and traders, at an average of £3million a head.

This equated to almost £60,000 a week, more than 120 times the average wage.

The average pay package of £246,000 for all staff last year dwarfs those on offer at Goldman’s rivals.

On Wednesday JP Morgan - which employs 11,000 people in the UK,. became the first US bank to publish its annual figures for last year.

It paid £135,000 on average to its 51,129 investment bankers.

Goldman Sachs insists it has been showing more restraint since the financial crisis.

Last year, staff pocketed just under 37 pc of its earnings – before the crisis it routinely paid out more than 40pc.

Its chief executive Lloyd Blankfein - who once claimed that banks ‘do God’s work’ - has also seen his pay cut.

His £14million pay package is a far cry from the £45million he was awarded before the financial crisis set in in 2007.

The UK banks are set to announce their pay and bonuses for last year in the coming weeks, but they are likely to be much smaller on average than those awarded at Goldman.

But Lloyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio is in line for a £7million windfall after hitting a number of performance targets, including returning the bank to profit and helping to push up its share price.

This award, which dates back to 2011, will come on top of his £4million pay package for 2014.

Labour have pledged to reintroduce a tax on bankers’ bonuses if they win the general election in May.
