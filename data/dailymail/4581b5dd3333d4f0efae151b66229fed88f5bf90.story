Stuck: The tabby was found wedged between the steering rack and some gear cables after the car broke down in Malton, North Yorkshire

A two-year-old tabby was found trapped in a car engine when the driver called a mechanic - a week after the cat went for a nap under the bonnet.

The cat, which has been renamed Lucky, was found trapped in a Nissan Primera when it broke down in Malton, North Yorkshire.

It is thought the cat climbed into the engine and nestled itself between some cables for a 30-mile journey from Ryedale, North Yorkshire, to Rufforth, near York.

A week later the car broke down in Malton, North Yorkshire, and a mechanic was called out to find out what was wrong.

Mechanic Ian Brindle, who opened up to bonnet to find the starving pet staring back at him, said that she had a 'lucky escape'.

He said: 'I plugged my computer into the car and it came up saying there was a faulty fuel pump.

'When I opened up the bonnet I saw the cat staring back at me and wedged between the steering rack and some gear cables.'

Mr Brindle, 44, of Norton, North Yorkshire, pulled on some gloves to try 
and free the cat, only to discover that she was wedged in the engine.

He added: 'I presume the cat got in there and the driver carried her up to Rufforth, where the car spent a week and came back.'

'I had to take half the car to bits to pull her out.

'She wasnâ€™t angry, just very hungry. I phoned Cats Protection up and they said to take it to the vet.'

Edward Button, principal of The Mount Veterinary Group, said: 'There are
 a lot of cats that get into that situation and do get severely injured 
by the engine, so she was very lucky to not get any injuries.

'We had to shampoo her, and that was all she needed apart from a little bit of TLC.'

The cat is now in the care of Cats Protection while attempts are made to trace the owners.
