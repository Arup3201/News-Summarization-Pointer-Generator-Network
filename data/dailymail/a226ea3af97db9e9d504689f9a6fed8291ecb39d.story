Wonga's founder trousered almost £1million last year despite the firm lending to thousands of people who could not afford to pay their loans back.

Errol Damelin's £970,000 package - up more than a quarter on 2012 - is understood to have included a payoff of almost £700,000 for 'loss of office'.

The revelation is set to heap fresh embarrassment on the firm, which authorities ordered last week to refund debts worth £220million to 330,000 of its customers.

Big payoff: Wonga founder Errol Damelin pocketed almost £1million last year - despite the firm lending to thousands of people who could not afford to pay their loans back. It included £697,000 for 'loss of office'

Straight talking? Wonga's TV adverts, which feature 'pensioner puppets', have been criticised at least twice by the Advertising Standards Authority. The latest came today after a complaint by the Citizens Advice Bureau

The Financial Conduct Authority found the firm had given loans to customers without enough checks to ensure they could pay them back. 

The regulator's action prompted Labour MP Stella Creasy to warn a million borrowers could be affected, telling MailOnline: 'Wonga is not the bad apple - the industry is a rotten barrel'.

South African Mr Damelin's pay was revealed this week in Wonga's annual accounts.

Despite leaving the day-to-day running of the firm in November, as the highest-paid director Mr Damelin is understood to have received a basic package of £273,000.

He is also understood to have received £697,000 for 'loss of office', bringing his total pay to £970,000.

Payout: Wonga was ordered last week to repay £220million in debts to customers who could not afford them

By comparison, all of Wonga's other directors put together earned £252,000 last year.

And Mr Damelin's pay packet saw a 29 per cent increase on 2012, when he was handed £754,000.

The entrepreneur founded Wonga only seven years ago, but the firm shot to prominence with controversial TV adverts which used cartoon-like 'pensioner puppets'.

In April the Advertising Standards Authority ruled an ad had confused the public about Wonga's interest rates - which were a representative APR of up to 5,853 per cent.

And today the ASA banned another ad for the payday lender after the Citizens Advice Bureau complained it did not include the controversial APR rate. 

Entrepreneur: Mr Damelin founded Wonga in 2007 and it quickly shot to a billion-pound business

The TV ad showed a man anxiously jotting down figures on a napkin before looking at his phone calculator and seeing the amount of £153.79.

An elderly lady than said: 'You appear to be in a financial quandary, young fellow. At Wonga you choose exactly how much to borrow and for how long.'

She added: 'You can even pay back early and save money.' 

A Wonga spokesman said 'we take any ruling from the ASA seriously', but added the advert had not been on screens since June when the 'pensioner puppets' were withdrawn by the firm's new chairman Andy Haste.

Mr Damelin quit as a director in June. It was claimed recently that he pocketed another £4million by selling a one per cent stake back to the company when he left its day-to-day running in November last year.

Wonga declined to comment on all matters surrounding Mr Damelin's pay. 

Last week it emerged Wonga's profits nosedived by 53 per cent last year as it counted the cost of the 'fake letters' scandal, which was revealed in June.

The firm had sent letters to thousands of its customers from non-existent law firms threatening them with legal action if they did not pay their loans back.

Lending fell in Britain, from £1.17billion in 2012 to £1.15billion last year, halving profits from £84.5million to £39.7million.

The decline came despite a huge increase in staff - with the wage bill soaring from £15.4million to £26.1million.

And the firm opened a new office in London in October last year, expanded its office in Cape Town and signed a ten-year lease on two floors of an office block in Dublin. 

Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned for several years against payday lenders, told MailOnline this week: 'Wonga is not the bad apple - the industry is a rotten barrel.

'There have been 5million people borrowing from payday lenders and it was about a fifth of Wonga customers that were affected.

'I would be gobsmacked if the Financial Conduct Authority weren't applying the same lessons that they've already done to other lenders.'

Highly-paid: Mr Damelin's earnings were almost four times those of all Wonga's other directors put together

The £2.8billion industry is facing its latest clampdown tomorrow, when another watchdog will set out how it should be reformed to inject more competition into the market.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has already estimated that a typical payday loan customer could be up to £60 a year better off if it was easier to shop around.

Tomorrow it will set out a provisional decision on what measures it thinks should be put in place.

When the £220million payout to customers was revealed last week, Wonga's new chairman Andy Haste said: 'When I joined Wonga I was made aware of concerns the FCA had already expressed around affordable lending, concerns which I shared.

'I committed to ensuring our lending is conducted in a responsible and transparent manner, delivering the best outcomes for our customers.

'I also said this would lead to a tightening of Wonga’s lending criteria and we will now be accepting far fewer applications from new and existing customers.'

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said he was 'delighted' the church withdrew its stake in Wonga

April 9: Advert banned

The Advertising Standards Authority watchdog rules a Wonga ad confused the public about its interest rates - which were a representative APR of up to 5,853 per cent. More than 30 complaints were received about the advert, which Wonga denied was misleading.

June 25: Fake law firms scandal

The City watchdog orders Wonga to pay £2.6m in compensation after it sent customers who were behind with their debts letters from non-existent law firms between 2008 and 2010.

July 11: Support from the Church vanishes

The Church of England announces £75,000 it had invested indirectly with Wonga is no longer with the firm. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (right) said he was 'absolutely delighted'.

July 14: A new leader promising reform

Andy Haste is announced as the replacement for founder Mr Damelin, who quit as a director in June. He vowed to repair the firm's reputation and ditched its 'pensioner puppet' mascots. 

September 30: Nose-diving profits

Wonga announces its 2013 profits fell by 53 per cent to £39.7million. It blamed extra costs from the fake letters scandal and compensation to 200,000 customers overcharged due to a technical hitch.

October 2: £220million of debts written off

The Financial Conduct Authority orders the firm to write off the debts of 330,000 customers who took out loans while unable to pay them back. Campaigners warn up to a million borrowers could be in a similar dilemma across the industry, not just those with Wonga.

October 8: £1million for founder and another advert banned

The firm's accounts reveal Errol Damelin pocketed £970,000 in 2013 - on the same day the Advertising Standards Authority rules against another 'pensioner puppet' advert which had already been withdrawn in June.
