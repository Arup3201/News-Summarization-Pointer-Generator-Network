The dramatic moment an uncle carried his terrified and bloodied niece to safety after she was kidnapped and held hostage in an abandoned Louisiana house was caught on camera today.

Bethany Arceneaux was taken hostage on Wednesday evening by Scott Thomas, her ex-boyfriend and father of her child.

A few hours after Marcus Arceneaux was pictured carrying his niece from a vacant house in Duson, a police swat team entered the building and Thomas was found shot dead.

Hostage: Scott Thomas grabbed Bethany Arceneaux, the mother of his child, on Wednesday evening

The 29-year-old mother had been stabbed and slashed but is expected to survive, her family told KLFY.

She has been taken to hospital and is in a stable condition.

She was rescued on Friday afternoon when a search party of family and friends confronted Thomas and managed to grab his victim.

Police who were also searching nearby rushed to the scene and quickly surrounded the house in a tense stand off that lasted a couple of hours.

Lafayette Police Corporal Paul 
Mouton told MailOnline the swat team entered the house, 'shots were fired and the suspect was deceased' at about 3pm (CST) on Friday.

Thomas died of injuries he sustained during the confrontation with Miss Arceneaux's relatives, according to reports.

According to Captain Kip Judice, of Lafayette Parish Sheriff's office, the victim's family had shot Thomas as they tried to free her from his clutches.

'Family members are walking through a pasture with an abandoned home ... and heard a yell from inside the home,' he said.

'Those family members entered the 
home and confronted Mr Scott Thomas ... who began to harm the victim. At
 that point, a confrontation ensued between the family member and Mr 
Thomas.'

He added that when a swat team later entered the house they found the body of the kidnapper.

Miss Arceneaux's ordeal began at 5.20pm on Wednesday when Thomas grabbed her from outside a day care center.

The
 29-year-old was seen forcing his victim into a Buick LeSabre before 
driving off with her, leaving the victim's child abandoned in her car.

The
 getaway car was found later that day in Anderson Road, Duson, but it 
wasn't until Friday that Miss Arceneaux was rescued from an abandoned 
house on the same street.

Relatives told KATC TV-3 gunfire was 
exchanged between the family and the alleged kidnapper but police could 
not confirm that.

Mr Arceneaux, the victim's uncle, said: 'We found my niece Bethany, she's OK. I'd like to thank everybody who came out and helped us search.'

'Friends and family actually came 
into contact with the victim and the suspect in or out of the house,' Lafayette Police Corporal Paul 
Mouton told KPEL.

'There was a confrontation at that point. During that 
confrontation, the victim was freed,' he said, adding that Miss Arceneaux was said to be in 'good condition other than some injuries that she had received'.

The couple have a violent history revealed in several police reports, according to KATC 3. She had filed several reports alleging domestic abuse and also filed a restraining order against Thomas.
