Long before Mitt Romney announced he was mulling a third presidential run, his handlers scheduled a sit-down meeting in Utah for Thursday with Jeb Bush – and the get-together is still on the calendar.

Romney and Bush are now both engaged in the business of figuring out whether to campaign for the White House, a process that involves currying favor with elected officials and buttering up donors.

In some cases, they're hitting up the same people just hours apart. 

An ABC News producer caught up with Bush at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., apparently about to board a flight for Salt Lake City, Utah.

Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell confirmed that the meeting is scheduled to take place today.

The New York Times reports that the two former governors – Romney of Massachusetts and Bush of Florida – could find themselves launching dueling presidential operations that will ultimately serve to split the GOP and dilute their individual power.

Two prominent Republican Party members spoke to the paper on Wednesday night. 

Romney shocked some observers two weeks ago by encouraging a small group of donors during a New York City meeting to tell their friends that he was considering a return to the campaign trail.

Bush had already announced the formation of a presidential exploratory committee in mid-December, and launched a political action committee this month. 

He proposed meeting with Romney in order to make a public show of respect – the kind of photo-op gesture that would signal his embrace of continuity among the Republican Party's moderate center.

But now the two men will likely compete for the hearts, minds and wallets of that constituency. 

GOP insiders fear that a bruising and protracted battle between the two men could leave whichever of them survives compromised and bloodied headed into a November 2016 confrontation with Hillary Clinton or another moneyed Democrat.

Or worse, according to one financier who says he has pledged to support Bush, 'the two could take each other down and open the door wide enough for a more divisive candidate to overtake them both.'

ALL SMILES (in 2012!): Bush rode on Romney's campaigns plane for appearances in Florida a week before the last presidential election

That's a reference to the party's conservative wing, populated by prospective candidates like Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, and the pugnacious New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Meanwhile the Times notes that Bush wasn't particularly helpful to ROmney during his unsuccessful 2012 White House run.

Some observers see the two politicians as subtly different flavors of the same dish, and worry that the party faithful won't have sufficient attention span to support two stock characters cast from such similar molds.

Some Romney loyalists, the Times reports, have asked their friends and business associates to pull back from committing their support to Bush, for now, in case Romney takes the plunge. 

Romney insisted this week in California that he hasn't given himself a deadline for deciding whether to enter the race.
