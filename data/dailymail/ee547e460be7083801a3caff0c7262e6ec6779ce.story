Jill Finney (pictured) has received a £500,000 payout from the Care Quality Commission

A senior health official accused of a cover-up over an NHS baby deaths scandal has been awarded a pay-out of more than half a million pounds.

Jill Finney, former deputy chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, was alleged last year to have ordered the destruction of a damning report into why the watchdog had not stepped in to improve care at a struggling baby unit.

Ms Finney always denied the explosive allegation she had told a colleague in a meeting to ‘read my lips’ and delete the critical internal review into its failure to act on concerns about safety at Morecambe Bay foundation trust.

Up to 16 babies and two mothers are feared to have died between 2001 and 2012 due to poor care at the maternity unit in Barrow-in-Furness general hospital.

But, despite the failings, the CQC gave the trust a clean bill of health in 2010 following a two-day inspection.

Last night the watchdog apologised to Miss Finney for the way they had released her name to the public.

They said this had ‘disadvantaged’ her desire to ‘protect her reputation’ against an allegation she had always denied.

They agreed an out-of-court settlement to pay her £60,000 in damages and £510,000 towards her legal fees - money that will be borne by the taxpayer.

But they did not withdraw the allegation that it was likely that she was part of a cover-up.

In a statement, the CQC said an IT bungle last summer had meant she was not told for 18 hours that her name was to be made public.

By this time she had been sacked from her new job as chief commercial officer at Nominet, the internet organisation which hands out .uk domain names.

The CQC said the mistake meant she could not defend herself against the allegation which she has always denied. ‘In addition, she suffered considerable distress,’ the statement said.

Last night Miss Finney told Channel 4 News: ‘This has wrecked my life and my family’s.’

Since the cover-up scandal, Miss Finney has gone into business providing ‘reputation management’ advice to the public sector - a move branded a ‘sick joke’ by one MP.

She set up the organisation with Cynthia Bower, the former CQC chief executive who was also at the critical meeting discussing the internal review.

Miss Bower had earlier resigned following a critical government review of the watchdog, which found it had put its reputation above patient safety.

Last night Miss Bower said: ‘I am delighted for Jill Finney. The fact that CQC have settled in the face of Jill’s legal action completely vindicates us as far as I’m concerned.’

The huge payout to a senior CQC official - equivalent to the salaries of 27 junior nurses - is likely to be met with anger from patients groups and relatives of those who died at the Furness hospital.

Last summer it emerged that a meeting had been held at the watchdog to discuss why it had missed repeated warnings about maternity care at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay foundation trust.

Louise Dineley, head of regulatory risk and quality at the CQC, produced a document showing that the 2010 inspection had been seriously flawed.

An independent study by chartered accountants Grant Thornton, published last summer, included claims by Miss Dineley that she had been told to destroy the report.

Originally, none of those accused were named in the study - but the names were eventually released.

At the start of this year, Miss Finney took legal action against the CQC for releasing her name - and had asked for £1.5million, saying it had cost her her job.

Last night, in an out of court settlement, the two sides agreed that the CQC would hand over £60,000 in damages, plus a contribution of £510,000 to her legal costs.

CQC’s chief executive David Behan said: ‘In January 2014 the Care Quality Commission’s former deputy chief executive, Jill Finney, instigated legal action against CQC.

‘This was following CQC’s publication of the Grant Thornton report into CQC’s regulatory oversight of University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust in June 2013.

‘Ms Finney’s legal claim was based on two key elements: a libel action in respect of the Grant Thornton report; and a claim for damage to Ms Finney’s reputation resulting from the manner in which her name was released into the public domain. The total damages sought were £1.5million.

‘Parties to high-value litigation are encouraged to consider confidential mediation at an early stage before legal costs escalate for both sides.

‘As a result of successful mediation, CQC has this afternoon issued a statement jointly agreed with Ms Finney.

‘In addition, CQC has paid Ms Finney £60,000 in damages reflective of those matters set out in the statement, specifically the manner in which her name was released.

‘This represents a full and final settlement with Ms Finney over all aspects of her claim. CQC has also made a contribution to Ms Finney’s legal costs.’

The two parties also agreed a joint statement.

It read: ‘The CQC has settled the proceedings brought against it by Jill Finney, its former deputy chief executive.

‘The proceedings arose from the publication on 19 June 2013 of a report into the CQC’s regulation of the University Hospital Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust (UHMB), produced by Grant Thornton LLP.

‘The CQC had previously committed itself to publishing Grant Thornton’s report, which came to the conclusion that Ms Finney may have been party to a “cover up” of a report into the CQC’s regulation and oversight of UHMB, something she and others have always emphatically denied.

‘From the interview stage, Ms Finney and others were highly critical of Grant Thornton’s fairness and processes including their interviewing, note-taking and record-keeping techniques. She complains that she was not even given advance notice of the allegations to be levelled at her in the interview.

‘The CQC deeply regrets its decision, taken on legal advice, to withhold the names of individuals in the report, as promised to Ms Finney and others. It then had to reverse that decision after names, including Ms Finney’s, appeared in the media as a result of speculation by journalists.

‘The consequences for Ms Finney were aggravated by the fact that some of the national media wrongly portrayed the internal report as being about maternity deaths at UHMB.

‘Further, due to confusion caused by an IT failure, the CQC failed to inform Ms Finney that her name had been released until 18 hours later, by which time she had been summarily dismissed from her then employment.

‘The CQC accepts that Ms Finney was thereby disadvantaged in protecting her reputation and giving her public defence to an allegation which she has always denied; in addition, she suffered considerable distress.

‘The CQC wishes to take this opportunity to apologise to her and is happy to repeat what its chief executive Mr Behan wrote to her at the time of her departure in February 2013: “You have been a rock of stability in CQC leading with passion, energy and dedication. You have given much, and people have testified to this”.’

Last year Miss Finney complained she had been the victim of a ‘media feeding frenzy’ over the report.

She said: ‘At that meeting we agreed that the report required much further work. There was not a decision at that meeting to delete the report, nor was there an instruction.’

She said that while Miss Dineley believes there had been an instruction to delete her report, ‘the other three individuals in that meeting do not recall that instruction’.

Last night the CQC said the damages and contribution to legal costs are insured by the NHS Litigation Authority.

A spokesman said: ‘By going to mediation we have resolved matters in a quicker and less costly manner than by going to trial.’
