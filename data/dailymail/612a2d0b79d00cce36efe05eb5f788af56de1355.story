Tragic: Liam Hardy, 14, had been hospitalised after a suicide attempt less than a week before he died, an inquest heard

A 14-year-old schoolboy who was about to become a father was found hanged days after being discharged from hospital following a suicide attempt.

Liam Hardy was allowed to leave St Helier Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, after his first suicide bid - despite pleas from his mother for him to be sectioned, an inquest heard.

Days later, he was readmitted when he tried to hang himself at home. Again, the teenager was released within hours.

But that same week, Liam was found dead in his bedroom as his grandfather took him a cup of hot chocolate.

He had just texted his girlfriend to say: 'It's no use, I'm giving up'.

Despite
 desperate attempts by Terry Hardy and paramedics to resuscitate the teenager, Liam never regained consciousness and died at St Georges’ Hospital, South London, nine days later.

Giving evidence at an inquest into her son’s death, Janine Hardy wept as she claimed pleas to have her son taken into care as a precaution were ignored.

She had caught Liam during his first attempt after school on November 15, 2012.

Despite trying to calm him down, he persisted until police and ambulance crews arrived, treated him for a superficial injury and took him to St Helier.

Even though he was seen by a doctor, a specialist nurse from the district Children and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS) and his therapist, Liam was allowed to leave and go back to his pregnant girlfriend’s house, against his mother’s wishes.

He was readmitted and discharged once more, before his grandfather found him on November 19, 2012. He died on November 27.

Accompanied by her partner, Ms Hardy said: 'I gave her all Liam’s history about his self-harming, what was going on in the present situation, how he didn’t get on with [his therapist] Catelin, that he wasn’t taking help seriously, about the pregnancy.

'She said she would go and speak to Liam, she would go and speak to him alone. She was in there for about 10 minutes. We went back in to the room. There was the C.A.M.S nurse, myself and Dean.

Devastated: Liam's mother, Janine Hardy, (pictured, left, outside Croydon Coroner's Court and, right, with her son) said she asked for him to be sectioned but her calls went ignored

'She said that Liam was fine now, he didn’t intend to die, no he doesn’t want to die. I told her he intended to do this.

'She said that in her opinion it was fine for him to go back to his girlfriend’s house.

'I wasn’t happy with it, I asked why she was discharging him back to his girlfriend’s, why she isn’t keeping him in or sectioning him.'

Liam, a pupil at Carshalton Boys Sports College who suffered from epilepsy, was expecting a child when he died

Liam, a pupil at Carshalton Boys 
Sports College, had a history of psychological health issues including 
epilepsy and had been assigned a therapist in May 2012.

At
 an earlier meeting with CAMHS in March, Ms Hardy had told how her son 
was self-harming, had been found with red marks around his neck and that
 'he didn’t want to live'.

She said she did not want her son to go into care at the time and was told 'there wasn’t any mental health issue there', although he was referred to Multi Systemic Therapy and eventually assigned to a therapist.

However, Croydon Coroner’s Court heard how he struggled to interact with the therapist, who he was supposed to meet 'a couple of times a week'. Ms Hardy claimed her son felt he was not being taken seriously.

After another altercation at their home in Worcester Park, Surrey, Liam was taken into custody after the police were called.

Again, his mother asked for social services to section him after he self-harmed.

However, he was allowed to leave the station before they had the chance to see him after being collected by his girlfriend’s father.

Liam had been expecting a baby daughter with his girlfriend, who can not be named for legal reasons, who was seven months pregnant at the time of his death.

In the stand today, his girlfriend told how she caught him choking himself in the weeks before he died, but he had promised her he wouldn’t do it again.

However a letter found at his grandparents’ home said: 'I’m very sorry for everything and I’m nothing without [my girlfriend]'.

A number of witnesses from local health agencies are due to give evidence.

The inquest continues.
