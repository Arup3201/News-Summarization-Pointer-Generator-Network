England prop Alex Corbisiero made his long-awaited return in a memorable match which saw Northampton concede 13 points before racing to their record Premiership win.

Corbisiero appeared in the 53rd minute after Northampton had overcome that early shock to seal second place in the Premiership and a home semi-final against Leicester on Friday night.

The loose head, who has not featured since last November due to a knee injury, proved his fitness to face Leicester and may yet be joined by another England front-rower in Dylan Hartley.

Running riot: George North scored twice as Northampton Saints thrashed London Wasps 74-13

Hartley, who has not played since Leicester’s last visit here in March because of a shoulder injury, is said by Jim Mallinder, Northampton’s director of rugby, to be ‘improving by the day.’

Corbisiero ran on to a huge cheer from the Northampton fans who have not seen him play since October for his club.

Mallinder added: ‘Alex loved it to be back on the pitch. He’s worked hard to get back and it’s brilliant for us that we have him as an option.

‘His selection is one of a number of options across the team. A lot of players have put their hands up to face Leicester.

‘We are physically and mentally in good shape and know Leicester will be very strong as they have a good record against us.’

Northampton scored 74 points without reply after going 13-0 down to early tries for Wasps by Charlie Davies and Tom Varndell.

The best rugby came before half-time when Northampton scored four tries in a 16-minute spell combining forward might and some excellent counter-attacks.

While Phil Dowson powered over from a line-out drive, Northampton’s swift handling brought tries for wing George North, fly half Stephen Myler and centre Luther Burrell.

The one-way traffic continued after half-time to the embarrassment of Wasps. They were also not helped by sin-binning offences for No 8 Nathan Hughes, in the 33rd minute, and near the end of the match for captain Chris Bell.

Scrum-half Lee Dickson scored twice for Northampton while North and Dowson also collected their second tries. Other scorers were full-back Ben Foden, wing Ken Pisi and substitute Tom Stephenson.

The avalanche of scores left Dai Young, Wasps’ director of rugby, furious at his team’s display.

‘That was an embarrassment,’ he admitted. ‘There is no shame coming to Franklin’s Gardens and losing but to lose by that score is unacceptable.

‘That was our first team squad and we were just not good enough,’ Young added about a selected team which was below full strength.

While Young rested some key players, 
including England’s Joe Launchbury who was a second-half substitute, he 
cringed at the final score.

Wasps must now pick themselves up for a two-leg play off against Stade Francais to settle the final place in the next season’s newly-constituted European Champions’ Cup. Both finished seventh in their respective leagues.

Mallinder was also a little surprised at the final score. ‘I was slightly worried when went 13-0 down but that was partly down to us because we were not accurate enough.

‘But what was pleasing was how we came back to dominate. We’ve got our home semi-final - that was our target.

‘Some of the young lads have put their hands up which was very encouraging.

‘The win gives us confidence but we won’t read too much into it. Wasps sent a weak side because they have their focus on next weekend in Europe and we are not daft enough to think anything else,’ he said bluntly.
