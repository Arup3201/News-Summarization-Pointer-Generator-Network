For eight years Lionel Messi’s critics have beaten him with the prettiest, heaviest, most valuable stick imaginable. But this genius player now has the chance to lift it above his head in celebration.

The stick is the World Cup trophy – a 14in, 11lb, 18-carat statue signifying the absence of international success for Messi, a man who has won everything there is in club football.

For all the mesmerising goals, captivating slaloms, cute passes, manifold medals and staggering statistics, his inability to drag his country to a first World Cup title since 1986 has been, for some, a barrier to entering the game’s gilded hall of all-time greats.

In that enclosure, sitting most 
comfortably, is Messi’s predecessor to position of Argentine saviour: 
Diego Maradona. He was the brilliant virtuoso in an ordinary team, the 
lighthouse in a shallow pool, and Argentina topped all other nations in 
Mexico 28 years ago because of his ability. At Italia 90 he got them to 
the final.

Messi’s fault, by comparison, has been a failure to repeat
 that most remarkable of football narratives. In truth, his 
opportunities have been limited.

He forced his way into the squad for
 Germany 2006 as an 18-year-old and became the youngest player and 
scorer for Argentina at a World Cup in the 6-0 win over Serbia and 
Montenegro. But he was a teenage newcomer nonetheless.

Four years 
ago in South Africa, Maradona was manager and his ideas for Messi were 
some way off central. ‘Javier Mascherano plus 10,’ was how he described 
his team.

In Brazil, Messi has been granted a platform to perform and
 seized it. Maradona may have repeated his claim about Mascherano after 
the midfielder’s superb performance against Netherlands but without 
Messi, there would have been no semi-final match to speak of.

At 27, 
his athletic peak, he has produced when it matters, getting decisive 
goals in three group games and laying on Angel Di Maria’s winner against
 Switzerland.

Before this tournament, Cristiano Ronaldo had, to 
common consensus, wrestled the crown of world’s best from Messi. 
Phenomenal scoring for club and country, topped off with Champions 
League glory, edged Ronaldo’s claim.

It came combined with a relative lull in Messi’s form and fitness. Just the 41 goals in 46 games for Barcelona last season.

Perhaps
 affronted by the notion his rival has risen to prominence, perhaps 
electing to strike hardest under the globe’s gaze in South America, 
Messi has responded. Masterminding victory over Germany in the final 
would get him to the summit of individual acclaim once more.

As well 
as Maradona, he would join Pele, winner of three World Cups, when 
regular discussions take place on the best to ever kick a ball without 
any footnote or disclaimer on international merits.

His exploits in 
Brazil have already gone plenty to lifting La Albiceleste albatross from
 around his neck, but winning on Sunday would place a golden frame 
around his picturesque career.
