A police chase ended deadly when a suspect's car sliced in two leaving three of its passengers dead and one
in critical condition.

Police in St Louis, Missouri say the Nissan Maxima, seen today in pieces, had been spotted fleeing a series of shootings just hours earlier prompting a short chase over two miles before losing control.

Just before crossing the Grand Boulevard bridge the vehicle slid sideways into several concrete planters knocking it into a light pole that consequently sliced its front end cleanly off.

Conclusion: The vehicle had been fleeing police when it lost control, sliding into several concrete planters before hitting the lamp post killing three inside

'The entire front of the vehicle was tore, and is probably
some 50-60 yards further north up Grand Avenue,' Capt Michael Sack of the St
Louis police told KSDK of the wreckage.

The rest of the body could be seen crumpled together as workers easily bent stray pieces off to the side during cleanup.

Capt Sack described the scene as 'horrific,' and something
unlike anything he's ever seen before.

The St Louis Post-Dispatch has identified the fatalities as
Lamont Cross, 22, Gregory Franklin, 23, and Dasha Rhodes, 20.

An unidentified 21-year-old man is currently hospitalized in
critical condition.

The driver of the vehicle has not been identified.

Shootings: Police say the vehicle had been spotted at two shootings just hours before, one of a house in this neighbourhood, pictured

Around 2.45am police say the first spotted the vehicle
described by witnesses as being at the earlier shootings around 11pm on
Wednesday and 1am this morning.

No injuries were reported from either shooting incident with
a home said to have been shot up with people inside.

Inside the vehicle a passenger was seen in the backseat
holding a weapon according to police, while a handgun was recovered during the
route of pursuit.

Grand Boulevard reopened around 8am following the grisly
scene that spread crash debris nearly 60 yards throughout the area.

No officers were injured in the crash.
