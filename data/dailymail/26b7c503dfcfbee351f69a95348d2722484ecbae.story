The pair will step into the octagon in Barueri in Brazil on Saturday night to do battle

‘This will be my third time down here in Brazil, the third time taking on a Brazilian in front of his home crowd,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘It’s just an awesome experience every time I get to fight in front of this crowd. I’m looking forward to the energy that will be in the building that night, and will be looking to feed off it.

‘They call me “The Doberman”, but they might as well call me “The Underdog”. My last five fights I’ve been the underdog in, it’s nothing new for me. I actually enjoy playing the underdog role – it gives you something to achieve, rather than something that’s expected.

‘They’re expecting me to lose, so I have something to prove – that I am not the underdog, that I can win. I’ve been able to do it in my last four fights and I’m looking to do so for the fifth.

The 31-year-old is looking to earn a title shot with a surprise victory against Machida this weekend

‘It’s going to get pretty exciting and it’s going to end with me knocking him out.

‘I believe I deserve a title shot after victory over Lyoto. He’s a former champion, he did just fight for the world title. He gave Chris Weidman a great match, and if I’m able to finish him I believe that leapfrogs me to the top.’

Machida, meanwhile, Is looking to bounce back from that defeat to Weidman.

Dollaway revealed he is enjoying  playing the role of the underdog ahead of the fight

‘I am very happy to be here (in Brazil). I expect to put in a great performance on Saturday and bring this victory for our country,’ he said.

‘I know this fight is going to be very tough for me because he is a very complete fighter, but I’ll try to knock him out. I’m looking for the knockouts all the time. If the fight goes to the ground, I’ll try to submit him.

‘I know he comes from a wrestling background but I’m not worried about his wrestling. I have trained a lot, but I’ll be there to bring my game, I’m not thinking about his game. I had eight weeks of my camp, I tried everything - I trained on the ground, stood up, I trained my wrestling. I trained everything because I don’t want any surprises in this fight.’
