Kurdish resistance forces  have this morning symbolically raised their flag over the Kobane hillside where the Islamic State's black jihadist banner was destroyed in a devastating American airstrike only hours before.

In a series of dramatic images, ISIS militants were seen standing by the flag on Tilsehir hill near the Turkish border yesterday afternoon  - after the terrorist group seized control of the strategically important hilltop, which lies two and a half miles to the west of the town.

Just moments later the hillside erupted into flames with one militant running for his life and another fighter appearing to stand his ground before being engulfed by an enormous cloud of smoke and dust caused by the ferocious power of the weapon. 

This morning the massive airstrike was revealed to be as strategically important as it was symbolic, with members of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) seen raising their own yellow banner over Tilsehir - suggesting the crucial hillside is once again in the hands of resistance fighters.

Symbolic: Kurdish resistance forces this morning raised their yellow flag over the Kobane hillside where the Islamic State's black jihadist banner was destroyed in a devastating American airstrike only hours before

Recaptured: Yesterday's massive airstrike was as strategically important as it was symbolic, with resistance fighters from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit today raising their own yellow banner over Tilsehir. The crucial hillside is once again free of ISIS militants

Not aware: ISIS' black jihadist flag was obliterated in a devastating American airstrike on the Kobane hillside yesterday afternoon. The area had been under the control of ISIS for the past few weeks, with militants pictured walking on the hill only seconds before the blast

Blast: Just moments after the above photograph was taken, the hillside erupted into flames. One militant standing on the hill appears to be calmy watching the blast, despite it occuring only feet away and causing a massive cloud of dust to roll towards him

Explosion: The Islamic State militant can be seen seemingly standing his ground as clouds of dust roll down the hillside. The pictures were taken using a long lens camera from across the border in Turkey's Yumurtalik village, in Sanliurfa province

Devastating: The hillside was completely obliterated in the attack - said to be launched by U.S. forces. The images emerged as American and Arab jets launched fresh attacks on ISIS positions in the north of Kobane

Smoke: Turkey, which has riled Kurdish leaders and frustrated Washington by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into Kobane, said this week it would help Iraqi Kurdish fighters cross into Syria to help their brethren against the militants

Yesterday's massive airstrike came after the terrorist group made a renewed assault on Kobane after being pushed out of the centre of the besieged Syrian city by hundreds of brave Kurdish resistance fighters

The YPG forces are believed to have made their massive advances by coordinating fierce street battles with the American and Arab bombing raids - forcing the well-equipped jihadis to retreat into the outskirts of Kobane.

One key location the jihadists managed to retain, however, was the strategically important Tilsehir hill in the Kobane suburbs - where the chilling site of their black flag has been flying for the past three weeks.

All that changed yesterday evening, when American warplanes carried out the massive airstrike that destroyed the ISIS flag and allowed the brave Kurdish troops to symbolically raise their own banner over Tilsehir. 

Although the bulk of ISIS have now been pushed outside Kobane, small cells are still thought to operating inside the city. 

Yesterday the group's flag could clearly still be seen inside city, raised over a multi-storey building just a few hundred feet away from where the yellow, triangular flag of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) was seen fluttering above a largely destroyed housing complex.

The chilling image of the ISIS flag still flying in Kobane emerged as lawmakers in Iraq's largely autonomous Kurdish region authorized peshmerga forces to cross into neighboring Syria to help fellow Kurds combat Islamic State militants in the city, providing much-needed boots on the ground.

The unprecedented deployment will almost certainly depend on the support of Turkey, whose president criticized a U.S. airdrop of arms to Kurdish fighters after some of the weapons wound up in the hands of the extremists.

Kobane has seen intensive fighting over the past few weeks, and Kurdish forces appear to be turning the tide against ISIS

Turkey, which has riled Kurdish leaders and frustrated Washington by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into Kobane, said this week it would help Iraqi Kurdish fighters cross into Syria to help their brethren against the militants, who also are being attacked by a U.S.-led campaign of airstrikes.

But it is not clear how many fighters will be allowed in or whether they will be allowed to carry enough weapons to make an impact.

The Kurds of Syria and Iraq have become a major focal point in the war against the Islamic State group, with Kurdish populations in both countries coming under significant threat by the militants' lightning advance.

Lt. Gen. Frederick Hodges, the outgoing commander of NATO's Land Command in Izmir, Turkey, said the Turks have agreed to open up 'a land bridge of sorts' so that the peshmerga can get into Kobane to help with the fighting there.

'It seems to me that between the United States, Turkey and other countries, they are figuring out what is permissible to make sure that ISIL is not successful and that it is something that Turkey can live with,' he added, using an acronym for the group.
