Heartbroken Melissa Smeaton discovered her boyfriend was cheating on her when she found his lover's knickers blocking her vacuum cleaner.

The 32-year-old moved in with 'reformed love rat' Richard Antony, 34, after he promised to put an end to his infidelity.

But she was left devastated when she took her blocked Henry cleaner to be fixed at a local repair shop and the technician pulled out a pair of frilly French pants belonging to another woman.

Busted: Melissa Smeaton discovered her boyfriend was cheating after finding these frilly French knickers beloning to his lover in her vacuum cleaner

Tearful Melissa stormed back to her house in Croydon to confront her lover with the 'cleaner in one hand and knickers in the other'.

Richard at first denied he had done anything wrong saying 'they are nothing to do with me'.

But after hours of interrogation, he eventually confessed his guilt when Melissa forced him to admit he had been seeing another woman.

Jilted Melissa, who had already seen her previous marriage collapse, today admitted her relief at rumbling the love rat.

Melissa, an event organiser, said: 'I 
could not believe it when the workman pulled out the frilly knickers - 
it was really embarrassing.

'I
was stunned at first but I knew they weren't mine and quickly realised 
he had been up to no good. I was heartbroken, I thought his wild ways 
with the ladies were behind him.

'It was like something out of a movie - I guess the idiot must have tried to dispose of the evidence by sucking up the other woman's knickers in the hoover.

'Who does that? And then he had the cheek to try and deny it. I was absolutely fuming.

'He was the man of dreams and I 
thought we would be together for ever.

'We had been planning a future 
together we even talked about having children.

'The pain was unbearable and I felt so humiliated in finding out about what had gone on in the way I did.

'I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive him. I trusted him and now I struggle to trust other men.

'At least I found out in time before we got even more serious.'

The couple met in a bar in Croydon, in January 2011 and dated for six months before he decided to move into her flat.

Melissa is now single and looking for a new partner, but says she finds it difficult to grow close to other men and struggles with trust issues.

She added: 'I was really hurt by what had happened. I never found out who the other woman was and we broke up straight away.

'But it was left being with real trust issues. Its difficult to get close to another man after being betrayed in such a painful way.'

Melissa discovered she was being two-timed in March this year.

Mr Antony said: 'Obviously, I feel sorry I feel sorry now more than I did before. I wish it had never happened. I want to try and make it up to her.'
