North London's bustling borough of Islington just got a whole lot more colourful.

On Clerkenwell Road, artists created a 3D art installation that looks as though the side of a building wall has been knocked through to reveal the interiors of a family home.

The project, which took over two weeks to paint, is designed to inspire homeowners to be braver with colour. 

North London's bustling borough of Islington just got a whole lot more colourful thanks to this art installation

Artists have crafted a 3D art project that looks as though the side of a building has been knocked through

The illusory display is a type of artwork known as trompe d'oeil and exposes what looks like a two bedroom household above the revamped Hat & Feathers public house.

Anything but a small artistic feat, the entire process took over 160 hours to cover the 1,352 square foot wall, and was created in honour of the UK and Ireland launch of Valspar paint.

The thousands of passers-by who frequent the busy street corner each day had to do a double take.

The lifelike interiors were brought to life by Poole-based community artist, Nina Camplin, who specialises in large-scale 'trick of the eye' paintings.

The project is located on a busy corner on Clerkenwell Road, and attracts the attention of many passers-by

In this instance, she used to her skills to create the 3D scene on an otherwise flat surface.

The campaign is intended to encourage UK homeowners to inject a bit of colour into their own living spaces.

Research shows that, currently, 78 per cent of UK homeowners opt to paint their homes in cream, white or neutral, while a mere 6 per cent of the nation embraces any sort of vivid hues in their interiors. 

Jane Ryder of Valspar Europe said: 'The reaction from the public so far has been amazing.

'So many people have stopped to take photographs and ask the artists about the project - it's starting to feel like London's latest tourist attraction!' 

Valspar Paint is available exclusively at B&Q.
