Criticism: Randi Zuckerberg has landed in hot water for using Veterans Day to promote her new book

The sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has landed in hot water for using Veterans Day to promote her new book.

Randi Zuckerberg, 31, who used to work at the social networking site, wrote on her Twitter page: 'In honor of Veterans Day, share how tech helped/complicated life while 
serving & get a free signed copy of my book!

But her attempt to use the special day as a form of promotion was met with disgust by many on Monday morning.

One user @DannyBrown tweeted: 'It's called Veterans Day / Remembrance Day, not "Get my book day", @RandiZuckerberg,'

While @dangillmor wrote: 'Most tone-deaf book promotion ever?'

She also posted the comment on Facebook, where it received 250 likes.

But one user Justin Kozuch wrote: 'To use Veterans Day to promote a book that has nothing to do with veterans is just disgusting. I'm not jumping to any conclusions. It's very clear to me what's going on here.'

But it appeared following a private discussion with Randi Zuckerberg, he backtracked and wrote on the post: ' So... I mentioned this to Randi privately, but I'll say it publicly because I think it needs to be said. Probably went a bit over the top in another thread (not going to link to it because I'm not exactly proud of it) with a comment I've made.

Tweet: Randi Zuckerberg, 31 wrote on her Twitter page: 'In honor of Veterans Day, share how tech helped/complicated life while serving & get a free signed copy of my book!'

'Apologies to Randi for making the comment-that-shall-never-be-spoken-of-again. Also, excited to read her book and give it a review on ye olde blog. So, there's that. Kudos to Randi for the book and helping vets connect to their families through the use of technology.'

It is not clear what was written in the post referred to or what exchange the pair had.

Last week Randi Zuckerberg defended her decision to publish two children's books encouraging people to stay away from social media - even if it doesn't fit with her brother's business plan. 

Randi Zuckerberg, 31, worked at Facebook in its formative years, serving as marketing director for six years before leaving in 2011 to strike out on her own.

She says her brother is 'supportive' of her latest enterprises.

Since 
leaving Facebook in 2011 she has formed Zuckerberg Media, a media and 
production company that so
far has a failed Silicon Valley reality show under its belt, had a 
child and produced the two books based on her ruminations on lifestyle 
and technology.

Given Zuckerberg's familial relations and work 
history, it has been noted that it seems disingenuous to take critical stance on a culture that she herself helped create.

In
Dot, a picture book illustrated by Joe Berger, a small girl named Dot 
who apparently spends all her time on social media - she 'knows how to 
tap . . . to swipe . . . to share' - has her iPad taken away from her by
her mother.

And in Dot Complicated, Zuckerberg covers how 
technology relates to etiquette, privacy, family and career, with tips 
and anecdotes interspersed.

Among other social media gaffes, Zuckerberg advises against oversharing, which she says 'can rob your partner of intimacy, as well as annoy your friends.'

In an interview with SF Gate she said she saw how easy it was to be consumed by silicon valley.

'It's easy, in Silicon Valley, to become absorbed in what we're building. It's important to raise your head and see the big picture. If I hadn't had a son, I'd probably still be there working 90 hours a week on projects, and be happy there.'

And writing her books she reveals how she relished the chance to turn off the technology.

'Gradually, over the course of a month, I loved being unreachable,' she told the paper. 'I saw that the world didn't end if I waited to respond to an e-mail in six hours, rather than six minutes.'

As
someone who has committed her fair share of social media faux pas, 
Zuckerberg feels she's uniquely qualified to write about navigating 
technology.

New book: Randi Zuckerberg's guide to navigating our increasingly connected world

'Personally, along with being part of the team that 
built Facebook from early on, I also grew up on social media,' she told 
CNET.

'If people can learn from my mistakes, or feel more of a 
sense of connection with what I’m saying because I’ve shown some 
vulnerability, then I think we’re at a better starting point.'

Among other suggestions, Zuckerberg writes, in a sentiment many will agree with, 'Just because you can document your every waking moment doesn’t mean you should.'She
told the San Francisco Chronicle that she never intended to be a social
media doyenne, but found that the same questions kept arising 
everywhere she went.

'I did a lot of public speaking last 
year, and no matter where I went, people always asked the same 
questions: how can I better understand what my children are doing 
online? How can I ask my significant other not to immediately reach for 
their tablet in bed? How can I make sure I don't lose my job to someone 
who is younger and more tech-savvy?'She gathered their business cards and launched a newsletter, Dot Complicated, to address those topics.

Many of those thoughts have been collected in the book, of which she says her family, including her brother Mark Zuckerberg, approves.

'My
goal with this book is to spark dialogue and inspire people of all ages
to embrace technology and the new sets of norms that come with sharing 
content online - something my family has always been supportive of,' she
told CNET.
