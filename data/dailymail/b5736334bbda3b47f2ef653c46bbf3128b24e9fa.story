Scientists have made an exciting breakthrough in the treatment of bowel cancer - using existing drugs.

Dr Toby Phesse, of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, said early data showed medication currently used to treat psoriasis, arthritis and myelofibrosis could help in the fight against the country's second deadliest form of cancer.

'About 17,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year and about 4,000 people die, so we are really crying out for new ways to tackle this disease,' Dr Phesse told Daily Mail Australia.

He said the lab's focus was directed at identifying which signalling pathways were used by tumours to grow and trying to target those pathways to prevent tumour growth. 

'We have known for many years that Wnt signaling is mutated in around 80 per cent of colon tumours. 

'However, this pathway is also very important for the health of the normal cells in the intestine, and therefore targeting the Wnt pathway directly poses considerable challenges as you risk effecting the normal cells of the intestine and therefore inducing severe side effects. 

'We had to come up with a new method and target a parallel pathway.' 

This is what brought scientists to the existing medicines, JAK inhibitors.

The scientists' breakthrough came when they found that 80 per cent of colon tumours responded to treatment with a JAK inhibitor. 

The treatment has caused excitement because the drug only targeted cancer cells, leaving normal cells unharmed, leaving no side effects.

'In the pre-clinic models we looked at the normal cells of the intestine and we found that all the cells could grow and function normally. 

'None of the mice used in the models lost any weight, suggesting they were healthy and could tolerate the drug very well.'

The scientists found that JAKs not only stop cell growth but also prevent the development of new tumours.

Dr Phesse said this is an exciting breakthrough that has great potential to help thousands of people who have colon cancer or face risk of developing tumours.

'The main point is that the inhibitors already exist and have been approved,' he said. 

'This means it is going to speed up the clinical trials process'.

Dr Michael Buchert, another scientist from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research said since the medicines are already being used for other cures scientists know it is safe for humans.

'We hope that this will enable our research to rapidly reach clinical trials for bowel cancer patients and deliver benefits in the near future.'
