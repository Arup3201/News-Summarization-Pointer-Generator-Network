Labourer Gary Green is outraged with medics who failed to spot he had suffered two broken bones in his neck

An outraged father has told how doctors failed to spot that he had broken his neck in two places.

Labourer Gary Green, 51, was taken to Ipswich Hospital in agony after falling off a ladder from the second floor of a building and landing on his head.

Medics carried out scans and X-rays but discharged him, unaware that that he had broken two bones in his spine.

For two days Mr Green said he experienced 'excruciating pain' before he returned to hospital on a physiotherapist's advice.

An MRI 
scan then revealed he had suffered a severe neck injury.

Mr Green has since had emergency surgery and is now 
recovering in hospital.

He said: 'I knew I had neck injuries because I spent two days in 
excruciating pain.'

Gary's daughter, Kerrie Dunnett, 26, has issued a complaint
to Ipswich Hospital demanding answers over the medical error.

Mrs Dunnett, said: 'I want to know how they managed to miss the fact that my dad had a broken neck.

'My dad had the X-rays and the CT scan and then was discharged.

'He went back to Ipswich Hospital on Wednesday and he was in such excruciating pain that he had to lie on the floor.Â 

'I am just so disgusted about this and someone needs to do something about it.'

Ipswich Hospital has told the family that it will investigate the mistake.

Spokesperson Jan Rowsell said: 'All patients deserve the very best 
standards of care and we are concerned to hear about Mr Green's 
experience.

'We are looking at all aspects of his care very carefully 
and urgently to understand all the issues involved.'
