Getting hit in the face with a fruit is a risk you must be willing to take when you sign up to the famous Italian 'Battaglia delle Arance' -  Battle of the Oranges.

The three-day food fight in the small northern Italian city of Ivrea, takes place each February.

The
city is said to bring in 57,000 crates, or 400 tons worth of oranges 
from southern Italy that would otherwise be thrown away for use in the 
famous battle.

Oranges at the ready: Dressed up as Middle Age kings' guards, a group of men ride in a horse-drawn carriage and pelt 'foot soldiers' with oranges as thousands of people gather to re-enact a Middle Age battle

High impact fruit: An orange explodes after hitting a a member of a rival team is during the annual carnival battle in the northern Italian town of Ivrea

Outnumbered: Dozens of carriage teams on horse-drawn carts, are the tyrant's guards and they compete against nine foot teams, representing the rebellious commoners

The show must go on: One man was seen bleeding after an orange-related injury, although the organisers say that no one has ever suffered a severe injury and infact a black eye is viewed by some as a badge of honour

Sticky business: There are first aid tents set up around the piazzas used for the event, for anyone participants who endure an orange-related injury such as being hit in the face or falling over in the pulp

It's origins are unclear but the festival is said to have stemmed from the 19th Century when rebellious commoners threw away food the feudal lord had given them.

It
has now turned into a battle game with players dressed as guards 
throwing oranges from horse-drawn carriages, and while nine teams of 
commoners on the ground return fire with the fruit.

It attracts some thousands of spectators and participants who flood the area to take part as well as watch the sticky spectacle unfold.

One day of combat: According to organisers, each carriage player competes for only one day of the three day festival because being pelted with oranges can leave them covered in sore bruises

Good aim: Previous festivals had used apples and beans until sometime in the early 20th century when the last switch was made

Uniforms: Different teams have different uniforms and at the end of the festival judges decided on a winner based on the orange-throwing skills, their costumes and if they have managed not to pelt the horses with the hard fruit

Anyone
who wants to take have fun but not get pelted with oranges wears a red 
hat, which marks them as a spectator, although people have been struck 
with stray flying oranges before.

The festival 
concludes with a huge procession, and a fiery display, and after that, is just the massive clean up by a team of 100 workers to remove the sticky sea of fruit.

Flying oranges: All the participants are careful not to pelt oranges at spectators, but sometimes unlucky ones get struck by a flying orange

Celebration after the madness: The festival

Massive, sticky clean up: The splattered oranges create a sticky sea of fruit which is cleaned up by a team of 100 workers
