As Luis Suarez sunk his teeth into the fine detail of his £75million move to Barcelona on Tuesday night he accepted a call.

It came – as it often does - from his brother-in-law, a fellow professional footballer in a landscape as far removed from the sun-kissed La Rambla and grandeur of La Sagrada Familia as it’s possible to imagine.

Hours before playing for Icelandic champions KR Reykjavik against Celtic in a Champions League second round qualifying tie before a crowd of just 1,700, Gonzalo Balbi lifted the phone to seek the advice and encouragement of his famous – some might say infamous – in-law.

The brother of Sofia Suarez, the wife and teenage sweetheart of world football’s most notorious player, Balbi failed to learn much.

An anonymous figure against the Scottish champions he was hauled from the pitch after 58 minutes.

Meeting the media in a lounge of Reykjavik’s KR-vollur Stadium after a 1-0 first leg defeat which all but ends their Champions League hopes, however, the quietly spoken Uruguayan spoke warmly of his vilified relative.

His sister met Suarez as a teenager and had his two children. Despite being separated by the length of Europe, the siblings – the family – remain close.

Like others who know the former Liverpool striker, Balbi paints a conflicting picture to that conjured up by the incredible moment Suarez sunk his teeth into the shoulder of Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini.

Suarez 
earned a four-month FIFA suspension for his latest misdemeanour – the 
third of its kind – and is banned from going anywhere near the iconic 
Nou Camp home of Barcelona. Even for his signing ceremony.

‘I
 spoke to Luis before the Celtic match and I talk to him a lot,’ said 
the midfielder. ‘I’ve known him since he was 15 years old so we go back a
 long way.

‘He couldn’t come to the match in Iceland because he’s back in Barcelona sorting things out.’

Smiling, he adds: ‘I think he has much more important things on his mind right now… ‘But, of course, it’s nice to know I can call him anytime, he helps me a lot.

‘Luis is a great guy. He has a very bad image right now because of what happened in the World Cup - but he’s really not like that at all.

‘If you know him, he’s a really nice guy and would do anything to help you. You have to get close to Luis to really know him and thankfully I am.’

Suarez 
famously began dating Sofia in 2001 while working as a teenage street 
sweeper. In contrast with the penniless aspiring footballer, Sofia lived
 a comfortable middle class existence with her brother and other family 
members.

They
 welcomed Suarez into their home and moved to Spain en masse in 2003 to 
offer him the best possible chance to become a professional footballer.

Dream start: McGregor's strike came on his Celtic debut in the Champions League qualifier

‘Luis is a family man and he has a good character,’ adds Balbi. ‘Only the people who are closest to him, like his family and friends, see that.

‘We’ve know each other since we were kids and I’ve watched him grow as a player. He’s now one of the best in the world but, believe me, he’s had to fight for everything he has in his career.

‘He’s been a big influence on me. He’s always giving me advice and trying to help me with my career.’

Balbi was an unlikely addition to an Icelandic side populated by a banker, an architect and students.

A part-time outfit, KR signed him at significant expense and the identity of his brother-in-law has brought the club headlines, but no obvious hope of overcoming Celtic after Callum McGregor’s debut goal seven minutes from time.

‘Obviously I’d love to reach the level Luis is at, I want to play at the highest level I can in my career.

‘But I know how tough that is and games like the one against Celtic has shown me how big a step it is to Champions League level.’

KR travel to Murrayfield in Edinburgh next week (with Celtic Park being used for the Commonwealth Games) to face Ronny Deila’s side with an uphill task.

‘Maybe Luis will watch the second game on TV,’ adds Balbi, ‘I hope so. The first leg was a very tough game for us. We had to defend very well for most of the game and we had to run a lot.

‘We thought were going to hold on for a positive result so it was disappointing to lose the goal near the end.

‘Of course, it’s going to be very difficult for us to go through now but we can’ t give up. I was impressed with Celtic, they passed the ball very well and you can see they’re a very good team who have played in the Champions League a lot.

‘We will have to do a lot of running to do again in Scotland but we have to believe we can score and give ourselves a chance.’
