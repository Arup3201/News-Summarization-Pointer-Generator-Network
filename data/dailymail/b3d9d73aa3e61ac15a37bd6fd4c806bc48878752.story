Salon owner: Simon Pritchard, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, was found dead at home last May

A 35-year-old hairdresser hanged himself just five days after the birth of his twin girls due to the stress of working long hours to provide for his newborn children, an inquest was told.

Salon owner Simon Pritchard, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, was found dead at home by his mother Gillian, 67, and two friends.

He felt under financial pressure to provide child maintenance money which had forced him to work around-the-clock, friends told the hearing at Sutton Coldfield Town Hall.

His friend of 20 years, Paul Lewis, who found his body at his home, said: ‘I was concerned there were issues with his girlfriend at the time putting pressure on him for child maintenance money.

‘In a conversation we had about a year before, he said he was having a tough time. He said he considered doing it [suicide] but the thought of his mum stopped him.’

The inquest last Friday was told the couple had been suffering relationship problems since 2011.

Birmingham deputy coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe called the case ‘phenomenally tragic’ and recorded a verdict of suicide for his death in May last year.

She told the inquest: ‘His friends and family are clearly very loving and he had a wide circle of friends who were worried about him. There really are no words to express how sad this case is.’

The mother of the children - whose 
name was not made public - did not attend the hearing. Mr Pritchard had 
set up the Love hair salon in Sutton Coldfield just six months before 
taking his own life.

Dozens of floral tributes were left 
outside the business and friends and customers paid tribute
on Facebook at the time of his death.

Georgina Donlon said: ‘I only got to know
you in the last month, but in that short time I could see what a 
genuine, true gentleman you were. Just so sad you felt there was no 
escape or nowhere to turn.

‘Many would say the man who had it all. If only you had spoken out, you would have seen just how many people care.’

And Mary Callaghan said: ‘I hope, wherever you are, Simon, you can see all the love people feel for you. I'm sure I'm not alone here in wondering was there something I could have said to make you stay. We talked on Tuesday and I knew you were sad.

'My sister always said that there is something wonderful after this and that if we all knew about it we'd want to be there. She's been there nearly eight years now and I've asked her to look out for you.’

Nicky Rowney added: ‘Really shocked to hear about this tragedy. Can't begin to imagine the grief family and friends must be feeling - so, so sorry. The world has lost a very talented man.'
