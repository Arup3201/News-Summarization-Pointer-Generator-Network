Mark Webber managed to remarkably escape without serious injury after a huge crash in the season finale of the World Endurance Championship left his Porsche dismantled and in flames.

The 38-year-old, who used to race in Formula One, collided with the Ferrari of Matteo Cressoni on the 14th corner at the Interlagos circuit in Sao Paulo before his car slammed into the safety wall.

Fortunately Webber gave spectators the thumbs up before medics took the Australian to the Medical centre as a precaution.

Any fears of either the Porsche driver or Cressoni being in serious condition were allayed by the FIA in a statement on its official website.

'The race ended under the safety car after a serious accident between the Porsche of Mark Webber and the AF Corse Ferrari of Matteo Cressoni,' said the FIA statement.

'Both drivers were taken to the circuit's medical centre and, after initial examination, to the local Hospital Bandeirantes for further checks, their condition has been reported as satisfactory.'

A subsequent statement on Webber's official Facebook page said he was okay and had been taken for medical checks.

'After his accident in the six hour race in Sao Paulo, Mark is awake and alert,' the statement said. '(He) has been taken to the medical center for further checks.' 

A statement on Webber's website said he would stay overnight at the Sao Paulo hospital for precautionary checks.

The 38-year-old was extremely lucky to escape the horror crash at Interlagos relatively unscathed 

Webber would have been devastated to crash out, having qualified for the race in pole position and was attempting to claw his way back to victory from sixth place in the closing stages of the six hour race.

The former Red Bull driver won two Brazilian Grands Prix at Interlagos during his career in Formula One but also crashed on the same corner back in 2003 when racing for Jaguar.

After a 12-year career in Formula 1, former Red Bull driver Webber joined the Porsche team in the Endurance series where he finished ninth overall. 

The Australian has stayed in motorsport with the FIA WEC since retiring from Formula One in 2013
