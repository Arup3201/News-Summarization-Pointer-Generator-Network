One of the Army’s highest-ranking female officers is facing jail after she admitted fiddling her military allowances.

Lieutenant Colonel Angela Knock, whose nursing skills helped save hundreds of soldiers’ lives on the frontline in Afghanistan, is being court martialled after she pocketed thousands of pounds.

The 49-year-old commander’s spectacular fall from grace came after she led a team of highly-skilled medics at the operating theatre of the trauma hospital at Camp Bastion.

Mother-of-three Knock, a member of the Territorial Army’s 212 (Yorkshire) Field Hospital, dealt with thousands of severely wounded casualties during her warzone deployment.

The reservist worked under extreme pressure to treat harrowing injuries, including young soldiers with arms and legs blown off by roadside bombs.

Knock, who also works as a theatre nurse at Sheffield’s Royal Hallamshire Hospital, pleaded guilty last month to ten counts of false accounting and forgery.

The charges are understood to involve sums of about £8,000 she fraudulently claimed for gardening services at her home between 2009 and 2011.

She admitted the charges during a hearing at Catterick Military Court Centre in North Yorkshire. She is due to be sentenced in the autumn and faces military detention. She could also be stripped of her rank and thrown out of the military.

Knock, a widow, was a highly-regarded officer with the Royal Army Medical Corps. She is thought to have served as a ‘weekend warrior’ for 20 years while following her civilian career as a nurse.

She has served two tours of duty in Iraq and three in Afghanistan.

In 2011 she was deployed to work at the Role 3 Hospital in Camp Bastion, Britain’s main base in the Taliban heartland of Helmand province.

She ran the operating theatre at the facility, widely acknowledged as the best in the world. Some 98 per cent of patients survive their injuries.

The team of about 250 had to treat soldiers, civilians and even Taliban fighters – often several at a time – who had been badly injured by improvised explosive devices or in firefights. In an interview during her stint on the frontline, Knock, from Chapeltown, Sheffield, described the unique challenges of working at Camp Bastion.

‘A lot of the guys who come in, such as the triple amputees who suffer severe blood loss, would never have made it to hospital in Britain,’ she said. ‘They survive because of the speed of care from their colleagues and medics in the field, and the fact that when they arrive here, there are four or five surgeons in the emergency department waiting to start work. That doesn’t happen anywhere else.’

More than a dozen people a day required operations during 212 (Yorkshire) Field Hospital’s deployment.

One of the busiest days saw four critical cases, including a double amputee, triple amputee and an insurgent with shrapnel wounds who died on the operating table.

Her team also battled against the odds to save a three-year-old Afghan girl who suffered catastrophic injuries in a Taliban bomb blast.

Knock – whose sons are James, 22, Matthew, 20, and William, 18 –  said: ‘We deal predominantly with young men, some the same age as my sons. One of the worst was a triple amputee, whose pelvis had been disturbed, potentially damaging internal organs. We managed to stabilise him and he was flown back to the UK.’

She also put her specialist skills to good use in 2010 carrying out life-changing surgery when Haiti was devastated by an earthquake.

Knock worked with aid charity Merlin as part of an expert plastic surgery reconstruction team operating on victims. She told a local newspaper: ‘I’ve never been to a disaster zone before, but I cannot imagine any healthcare worker who would not love to be able to use their skills to help people who desperately need it.’

She said of the procedures, carried out in a makeshift operating theatre within an old tennis club: ‘Without skin grafting some of the wounds would have broken down, which would have led to infections and amputations.

‘By getting the skin covering them, although they will have another two weeks of dressings, they should be able to get back on with their normal lives.’
