Inter Milan have sacked head coach Walter Mazzarri, with Roberto Mancini the leading candidate to take over at the San Siro.

The Serie A giants are languishing in ninth place in the table after a summer of heavy spending, bringing in Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic among others.

Sportsmail understands Mancini has been offered a two-and-a-half-year deal by Inter, where he would return to a club he won the title in three consecutive years between 2005 and 2008.

The former Manchester City manager was most recently relieved of his duties at Galatasaray.

A club statement read: 'Walter Mazzarri has been dismissed as coach of the first team. 

'The company thanks Mazzarri for the commitment, dedication and the seriousness with which he led the team in these 17 months.

'Today's (Friday) training session will be conducted by Giuseppe Baresi.'
