Emails leaked in the Sony hack have revealed that Sony's Japanese CEO urged filmmakers to edit the death of Kim Jong-Un to make it less graphic in a bid to avoid a crisis.

In The Interview, which is due to be released over Christmas, the North Korean dictator, played by Randall Park, is in a helicopter which is hit by a rocket.

The footage of the dramatic scene, released as part of the cyberattack, shows the tyrant's face covered in burning embers and melting before the aircraft explodes.

It is believed to be the final cut of his death, following a number of alterations discussed by Seth Rogan and the company's executives in both the United States and Asia.

In The Interview, which is due to be released over Christmas, the North Korean dictator, played by Randall Park, dies when a helicopter he is in is hit by a rocket

In an email, obtained by The New York Times, the movie's creators Rogen and Evan Goldberg tell Amy Pascal, the employee at the center of many of the leaked messages, the edits they have made to the scene.

It includes an angry correspondence from Rogen saying: 'This is now a story of Americans changing their movie to make North Koreans happy. That is a very damning story.'

It reads: 'We took out three out of four face embers. Reduced the hair burning by 50 per cent, and significantly darkened the chunks of Kim's head.

He finishes by saying: 'Let us know what you think ASAP.' 

Pascal then consults Sony's Japan-based CEO Kazuo Hirai about the shot described in Rogen's email.

She said that the filmmakers arrived at the shot after much 'cajoling' and asked whether it was an acceptable end product. Pascal insisted that it included reduced 'face-melting' 

Hirai agrees with her, but in the first intervention from the company in 25 years, he asks her not to include the version in the international edition of the film.

Following emails between Amy Pascal (left) and Sony's Japan-based CEO Kazuo Hirai (right), Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg were forced to change the ending to make it less graphic 

He then urges her to push Rogen and Goldberg 'a bit further' to see if they can make the scene less graphic. 

Pascal responded by saying that Rogen was 'happy' with the agreement.

However the director replied following the final cut, which saw them remove 'fire from the hair' and the 'secondary wave of head chunks', saying: 'This is it! Please tell me this is over now.' 

In the movie, two American journalists are recruited by the C.I.A. to kill the North Korean leader.

Experts on North Korean society said that it would not be much of a surprise if the country was behind the hacking.

On Monday, Rogen and James Franco, the stars of the comedy, broke their silence over the hacking.

In one of the leaked emails, a frustrated Seth Rogen says: 'This is now a story of Americans changing their movie to make North Koreans happy. That is a very damning story'

In an interview on ABC's Good Morning America: 'I don't know if the hacking honestly is because of our movie, definitively or not. I know that it has been the center of a lot of media attention lately,'

Included in the leak were Rogen, 32, and 36-year-old Franco's salaries for the film, with a reported budget of $44 million.

Records showed that Rogen, who also directed and wrote the script, was paid $8.4million for the film, while co-star Franco was paid $6.5 million. 

'The movie itself is very silly and wasn't meant to be controversial in any way,' he added.
