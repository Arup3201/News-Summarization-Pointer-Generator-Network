Reform: Sir Ian Kennedy is set to propose a £10,000 pay rise for all MPs

Government Ministers tried to sack 200 Commons cleaners, cooks and manual workers to justify a £10,000 pay rise for MPs, it was claimed last night.

The aim was to use the £6.5million staff savings to finance the salary hike for MPs and show that the overall cost of running Parliament had not gone up.

But it was rejected after officials warned there would be uproar if MPs sacked low paid workers to give themselves a 15 per cent rise.

The row was disclosed on the eve of a new pay deal for MPs which is expected to say they deserve a £10,000 rise on their £66,396 salary.

All three party leaders have expressed doubts about a big pay rise, but they are powerless to stop it because Parliament handed over control of MPs’ pay to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, headed by Sir Ian Kennedy who has hinted strongly he thought MPs deserved a significant pay hike.

Instead, David Cameron hopes to avoid public furore by showing the overall cost of running Parliament has not gone up.

Commons sources say senior officials have asked Parliamentary chiefs to find ‘substantial savings’ to offset the cost of the MPs’ rise.

Outrage: One proposal would have meant sacking 200 cleaners from the Palace of Westminster

The officials were told the only way would be to get rid of more than 200 Commons workers, most of whom earn less than £20,000 a year.

The Parliamentary chiefs warned any such move would be ‘grossly insensitive’.

An insider said: ‘The idea that anyone could sack people who earn a fraction of an MPs’ salary to give them an extra ten grand is offensive.’
