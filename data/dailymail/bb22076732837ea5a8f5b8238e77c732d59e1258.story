Record numbers of Britons are working part-time after those struggling to find full-time positions pushed the figure above the eight-million mark for the first time.

Official figures show that 8.07 million people toil for fewer than 25 hours a week - the highest figure since records began in 1992.

One in seven of them would like to work longer but can't find the job, while others only remain in part-time employment because they can't afford to retire.

The grim figures came amid warnings that the so-called 'Olympic effect' - which has helped overall unemployment fall in recent months - will end after the summer.

Union bosses said the booming numbers of part-time workers only reflected soaring levels 'despair and waste of human talent' and they called for George Osborne to be axed as Chancellor.

Boost: Many people are taking part time jobs in supermarkets, shops and offices because they cannot get full time work

However, the Government has trumpetted the fact that overall unemployment has fallen to its lowest level for a year after a big jump in the number of people in work.

The jobless total fell by 46,000 in the quarter to June to 2.56 million, an unemployment rate of 8 per cent, according to the office for national statistics.

The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance last month was 1.59 million, down by 5,900 on June.

Most of the quarterly fall in unemployment was recorded in London, suggesting a big jobs boost from the Olympic Games that could go the other way after the summer ends.

Experts are questioning how much the unemployment figures can 'defy gravity' at a time when the economy as a whole is contracting.

'While this is undoubtedly good news, the latest labour markets statistics do raise questions about why they seem so out of kilter with other recent economic data.

'It is therefore not clear whether these data herald better economic news to come and whether the Olympics can offer a lasting economic legacy.'

The number of people in work increased by 201,000 to almost 30 million, 
the highest since last summer, with half of the rise coming in London.

Average earnings increased by 1.6 per cent in the year to June, up by 0.1 per cent on the previous month.

Youth unemployment  - for those between 16 and 25 - remains at just over one million despite figures showing a drop of 4,000.

Union leaders warned that Britain faces an unemployment rise once the Olympic effect has worn off and urged the Government to reverse its cuts plans.

Paul Kenny, leader of the GMB union, 
said: 'These figures show the level of despair and waste of human talent
 in an economy going through this double-dip recession five years on 
from the credit crunch of 2007.

'David
 Cameron and Nick Clegg should now conclude that George Osborne is 
simply not up to the job of steering our economy and he should be moved 
to make way for a change of direction as he has proved beyond doubt that
 it is not possible to deflate your way to growth.'

Dave Prentis, general secretary of 
Unison, said: 'This small fall is welcome, but there will be no lasting 
Olympics legacy in the jobs market.

'The end of thousands of temporary jobs will see unemployment climbing after the summer.

'Students waiting for A-level results
 this week face a bleak jobs future. They are set to join the dole 
queues in high numbers as the hike in tuition fees has priced many 
thousands of young people out of their dream of going to university or 
into further education.

'The Tories need to inspire a generation by rebuilding our economy and safeguarding the future.

'This must include targeted help for 
young people, as a part of a wider programme of Government-led job 
creation. The continued austerity agenda is condemning our economy to 
the slow lane.'

But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain 
Duncan Smith suggested that the overall trend in the jobless figures was
 positive and insisted that the Coalition's policies were helping to 
deliver future growth.

He said: 'These are positive and 
encouraging figures demonstrating the strength of our private sector - 
notwithstanding the difficult economic times it is still creating jobs, 
the vast majority of which are full time. Unemployment is falling and 
the claimant count is down.'

Unemployment has fallen for five 
consecutive quarters, while the so-called claimant count was down for 
the first time since April.

But there was an increase of 1,600 in 
the number of women claiming jobseeker's allowance to 530,000, compared 
with a 7,500 fall among men, to just over a million.

The number of people classed as economically inactive, including those looking after a sick relative, on early retirement, or who have given up looking for work, fell by 117,000 to 9.1 million, just over 22 per cent of the working age population.

Around 150,000 people were made redundant in the three months to June, down by 21,000 from the quarter to March and 4,000 lower than a year ago.

Sectors showing the biggest increase in jobs in recent months included wholesale, retail and motor vehicle repairs.

There were 472,000 vacancies across the country in the quarter to July, up by 10,000 on the three months to April, and 16,000 more than a year ago.

But not everyone criticised the Government.

Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'The labour market continues to defy gravity and is performing remarkably well given the extended weakness of the economy.

'It is very hard to reconcile employment growth of 201,000 in the three months to June, with GDP contraction of 0.7% quarter on quarter in the second quarter, especially as this was a third successive quarter of decline.

'The implication is that either the economy is doing appreciably better than the national accounts data show, the labour market is doing significantly worse than the hard data show, or productivity has genuinely weakened sharply. The jury is currently very much out as to what the actual answer is but it could very well be a combination of all three.'
