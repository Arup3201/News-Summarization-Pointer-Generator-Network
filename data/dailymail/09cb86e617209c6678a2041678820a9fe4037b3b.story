Dressed in army fatigues and posing with a machine gun, this military enthusiast yesterday became the second man to be arrested on suspicion of stealing war memorabilia.

Daniel Mackay’s home was raided yesterday by police searching for artefacts that may have been illegally dug up with the help of metal detectors and removed from heritage sites.

Mr Mackay, 35, from Bicester, Oxfordshire, was pictured online posing with his wartime finds and featured in a macabre YouTube video entitled ‘Exhumation of German soldiers in 2014 Kurland,’ an apparent reference to a Second World War battlefield in Latvia. In the video he is referred to as a military archaeologist.

An Army bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion of historic munitions at Mr Mackay’s home at 1.30pm yesterday. Police would not give details about the items involved in the explosion 

The video was posted in June by 48-year-old Alan Tissington, whose home 40 miles away in St Albans, Hertfordshire, was raided by police on Wednesday, when a massive cache of guns, bullets, bombs and shells was discovered.

Sources close to the case said the men knew each other and went to European battlefields and ex-military sites in the UK with metal detectors most weekends.

An Army bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion of historic munitions at Mr Mackay’s home at 1.30pm yesterday. Police would not give details about the items involved in the explosion.

Detective Inspector Steve Raffield said the operation was in its early days and the search of the terraced house was likely to continue for several days. ‘It looks like World War One and Two munitions and memorabilia,’ he said.

‘It is going to take quite a while to work out what they are.’

Leah Cato, 32, who lives on the same street as Mr Mackay, said: ‘It’s been crazy. I woke up this morning to see police tape and police cars.

‘I thought “Oh my God, what’s going on?” We didn’t know anything. It wasn’t until I saw the bomb disposal unit that I realised what it was.’

The mother-of-three said that she and her family felt the controlled explosion at the top of the street, adding: ‘It was a massive explosion. I was inside but had the back windows open,’ she said. ‘It really scared my little boy.’

Another neighbour, who did not wish be named, said she had often taken deliveries for Mr Mackay.

‘He receives a lot of post and a lot these parcels are marked from Germany,’ she said.

Thames Valley Police said that it is ‘a criminal offence to retrieve artefacts from the ground through using a metal detector if the land is a protected site or without permission of the landowner.’

A spokesman added: ‘As a result of information following warrants executed in St Albans, Hertfordshire, to target the theft of heritage artefacts and munitions, Thames Valley Police has arrested a 35-year-old man from Bicester this morning on suspicion of theft.

‘A quantity of First and Second World War munitions were located, as a result of the arrest, at a residential address. The man was arrested on suspicion of theft from heritage and protected sites and is currently in police custody.

‘It is suspected that the arrested man obtained these artefacts through illegal metal detecting, which is a heritage crime.’

A spokesman for English Heritage said the police operation ‘sent a clear signal’ to those involved in digging up wartime weaponry without permission.
