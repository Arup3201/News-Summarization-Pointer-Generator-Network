A woman shot her boyfriend in the face at point blank range at the Pennsylvania home they shared, before tampering with the crime scene to make it look like a suicide, a court heard.

Jessica Alinsky initially claimed Matthew Gailie shot himself during a violent row at their home near Hazleton in September 2011.

After a desperate 911 call by Alinksy on the night of September 2, 2011, police and paramedics discovered Mr Gailie dead on the living room floor with a gunshot wound to the face.

Confession: Jessica Alinsky has pleaded guilty to third-degree murder after her boyfriend Matthew Gailie was found dead at the home their shared in Pennsylvania in September 2011

When questioned, Alinksy gave four different versions of what happened.

The death remained under investigation for years, but in July last year a coroner's inquest determined Mr Gailie did not commit suicide but was murdered.

The jury claimed Alinksy was the killer, having fired the gun at point blank range, inches from her boyfriend's face.

Giving evidence at the inquest, Alinsky chose to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

In November District Judge Jamie Dixon in Hazle Township ruled that there was enough evidence to send the case to trial.

But on Wednesday, Alinksy pleaded guilty to third-degree murder and now faces up to 40 years in jail.

Moments later she told reporters she didn't commit the crime, citizenvoice.com reported.

She said: 'I would never hurt him. Time will tell, and the truth will come out.'

Luzerne County Judge Tina Polachek Gartley told the court Alinsky will be sentenced on May 16.

State troopers investigating the shooting said they suspected Alinsky almost immediately, refusing to believe it was suicide.

A spokesman said the body had been moved and the blood spatter did not fall in line with Mr Gailie having committed suicide.

Frank Gailie, the victim's father, told Eyewitness News: 'We knew it just wasn't right from the start.

'My son did not change from a young man to the time of his death.'
