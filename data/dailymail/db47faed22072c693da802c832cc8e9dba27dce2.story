Steve Weaver was killed while cycling near his holiday home in France

A Briton has been killed a hit-and-run accident near his holiday home in Provence, France.

Steve Weaver, 64, the chief executive of Blackpool Council from 2002 to 2011, was knocked off his bicycle around 1.30pm on Wednesday and despite being flown to hospital via air ambulance died from his injuries.

French police are now searching for the motorist, who drove off in his small Ford after the crash.

The car is believed to have been coming from the hamlet of Veaux towards Malaucène when the accident happened on a bend.

Commander Sébastien Roussignol of the Malaucène police, said: ‘The cyclist had gone out for a ride in the countryside.

‘The driver of the car coming in the opposite direction lost control and hit the cyclist.

‘He was hit by the car and left for dead.

‘The driver escaped. They have not yet been identified and we are searching for them.’

Yorkshire-born
 Mr Weaver, a close friend of former Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw, 
was one of the architects of the creation of Blackburn with Darwen 
Council and spent 27 years working for the council.

He was seen as one of the key figures in the success of Blackburn with Darwen’s breakaway from Lancashire County Council in 1998.
