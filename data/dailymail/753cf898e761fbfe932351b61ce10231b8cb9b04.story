When former Barcelona B, Roma and Celta Vigo coach Luis Enrique begins work as Barca's new coach he will face the task of carrying out the biggest overhaul of the team since his pal Pep Guardiola took charge in 2008.

The size of the job was made clear by the fact that the first player of the Luis Enrique era had already been signed before the man who played for Barcelona during the last eight seasons of his career had even been officially presented.

Marc-Andre Ter Stegen’s arrival was announced at the same time as the new manager’s. The 22-year-old keeper signed from Borussia Monchengladbach will come in for Victor Valdes who joins Monaco. But the signings will not stop there.

Going nowhere: Lionel Messi has penned a new £16.3million-a-year deal to stay at Barca

Barcelona have also confirmed that Jose Pinto will cease to be reserve keeper. Messi’s great pal has shown in the run-in that he no longer has what it takes in times of emergency and the new manager will study a list of options that include Valencia’s Diego Alves, Levante’s Keylor Navas, Malaga’s Willy Caballero and Liverpool’s Pepe Reina. The latter two might end up at Atletico Madrid if, as expected, they lose Thibaut Courtois back to Chelsea.

Dani Alves will join Valdes and Pinto in the cull. His move to Paris Saint-Germain is all but sealed and one of Luis Enrique’s most difficult jobs will be replacing the Brazilian right-back who arrived in 2008 coinciding with the greatest era in the club’s history. A new right back will definitely be needed because there is little belief in the B-team's Martin Montoya who may also be sold this summer.

In the centre of defence there are even bigger problems. Carles Puyol is irreplaceable… but he will need replacing all the same. David Luiz certainly has the hair for it. He also has the chaotic, occasionally calamitous style that Puyol showed earlier in his career.

Option: Enrique could make a move for Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina, who spent last season on loan at Napoli

Barcelona’s outgoing captain is very close pals with Luis Enrique so it may well be that the man himself advises on who Barcelona should bring in. Athletic Bilbao’s Aymeric Laporte and Real Sociedad’s Inigo Martinez are also being looked at as new recruits for the centre of a defence that conceded soft goals all season right down to that Diego Godin header that finally lost Barca the league.

Vincent Kompany and Javi Martinez are the players Barça would really like to bring in but both have no intention of leaving their current clubs, no matter how much money Barcelona can find to throw their way.

In midfield Alex Song was sold to Barcelona fans as someone who could play in the centre of defence or in midfield. The former was plainly never true and he has never been given the chance to demonstrate the latter. Luis Enrique is understood not to be a fan, preferring Rafinha who has already been recalled from his loan spell at Celta Vigo where he played under the new boss.

Barca are also talking up interest in Paul Pogba though they accept Juventus are unlikely to sell. Toni Kroos is another target but Louis van Gaal might have other ideas. Luis Enrique is understood to be upset the club sold Thiago Alcantara – the brother of Rafinha – to Bayern Munich and will look for a similar option if he can find it from inside La Liga.

To fund the overhaul at least one big name player will have to be sold. Cesc Fabregas, Pedro and Alexis Sanchez are all available at the right price. None of them will leave for so much as a euro less than Barcelona want for them, and Fabregas’ suitors have already been told that it will take £45million to get him, and it’s also clear they won’t all leave. But for Barca to bring in as many players as they want to they will have to sell at least one top earner. Alexis is the most likely of the three to eventually move on.

Cristian Tello, Adriano, Ibrahim Afellay and Isaac Cuenca will also be shown the door to make way for returning loanees such as Gerard Delofeu who returns to play for his former Barca B team boss. Everton could sign 18-year-old Adama Traore on loan to fill the gap, he is another Barca youngster who would benefit from Premier League experience.

It used to be that Plan A worked so well that there was no need for a Plan B but in meetings with sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, Luis Enrique has already made it clear he wants a big centre-forward who can offer solutions when all else fails. Fernando Llorente has been discussed although as with Pogba Juventus would be reluctant to sell.

The new manager will also sit down with Xavi and Javier Mascherano. Such is the huge respect for these two players they will only go if they decide to. Neither can be assured a first-team place in the new Barcelona and so if Xavi is tempted by an MLS adventure and Mascherano fancies Serie A or a Premier League swansong they will be allowed to move on.

And when all the ins and outs are sorted Luis Enrique has the minor job or resurrecting Lionel Messi. He signed his £16.3m contract on Monday but the four-times Ballon d’Or winner has looked a shadow of his former self. It will be new man’s biggest challenge to make him shine again.
