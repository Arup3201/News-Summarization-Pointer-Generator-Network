A former Tory MP has launched an astonishing attack on the Justice Secretary, saying: 'Chris Grayling is a s*** that needs to be flushed'.

Jerry Hayes, who was the Conservative MP for Harlow from 1983 until 1997, blasted Mr Grayling, who is also Lord Chancellor, as 'off his trolley'.

Mr Hayes, who resumed his career as a barrister in criminal law after losing his seat, launched the vitriolic tirade on his blog, criticising Mr Grayling's reforms to the judicial review process which are set to become law.

Mr Grayling believes judicial review could be used by campaigners to disrupt government and blackmail public bodies.

But Mr Hayes blasted him as 'incompetent and a disgrace', adding judicial review is part of 'the rule of law' - but Mr Grayling believes it is 'the wicked work of smelly socked swampy types'.

He wrote: 'If we were not a few weeks away from an election Chris Grayling would have been ventilated from office. 

'The man is incompetent and a disgrace.

'His department has been judicially reviewed so many times and spend so much time in the High Court that it is amazing that they haven't put in a right to buy. It is not surprising that he wants to limit it.'

Mr Hayes, pictured at a Tory conference in Blackpool in his MP days, said: 'After the election when Cameron returns to Downing Street Grayling is a s*** which will have to be flushed'

Describing Mr Grayling as 'gothically comic', he said: 'If your kid has been deprived of a school place, or some dreadful development has suddenly appeared out of nowhere and the government hasn't obeyed the rules laid down by Parliament you can toddle of the the High Court and try and persuade a senior judge that you are not being vexatious or frivolous. 

'And it is a rigorous sifting process. We call it the rule of law. But according to Grayling all this is the wicked work of smelly socked swampy types. Bloody lefties. 

'The rule of law, like freedom is so precious that it has to be rationed.'

Mr Hayes also highlights criticism of the reforms by former chief justices and former Tory cabinet ministers, as well as by the law lord Lord Pannick, who said Mr Grayling's remarks on judicial review 'demean' his office. 

He concludes: 'After the election when Cameron returns to Downing Street Grayling is a s*** which will have to be flushed.' 

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'It is crucial that judicial review continues to hold authorities and others to account for the right reasons. 

'It should not be abused by people to cause delays or to generate publicity for themselves or their organisations at the expense of taxpayers. 

'Our reforms will bring balance to the judicial review system so justice is done, but unmerited, costly and time-wasting applications no longer stifle progress.'
