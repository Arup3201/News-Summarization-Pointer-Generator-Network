A woman trapped under a train was freed when commuters worked together to push it backwards.

The incident happened yesterday afternoon on the JR Yamanote Line at Shibuya Station in Tokyo, Japan.

The woman, reportedly in her 60s, was heard crying 
out for help from beneath the train and she lay between the 
rails of the track.

Dozens of people worked together to push a train carriage back far enough for station staff to be able to help a woman who'd got trapped under a train in Tokyo

Reports in Japan suggested the elderly woman had attempted to kill herself by jumping
 in front of the oncoming train.

Then, following an announcement over the 
stationâ€™s public address system informing commuters that a woman was 
trapped beneath the train and asking for their help, the crowd intervened.

Dozens of people managed to push the carriage back far enough for station staff to be able to help her.

The woman was freed at taken to hospital for treatment.

Reports suggest that the accident, which occurred just before the evening rush hour, affected more than 26,000 commuters along the line.

In July earlier this year, Japanese commuters helped another stranger in need.

On July 22, around forty passengers at the JR Minami-Urawa station, just outside Tokyo, helped push a 32-ton train carriage to free a woman trapped in the platform gap during rush hour on a Monday.

They were able to pull the woman in her 30s out from under the platform, safe and uninjured.

Everyone in the station had applauded the 'rescue effort' at that time, and operations resumed, with just a slight delay of eight minutes to the entire Keihin Tohoku Line.
