Blindfolded, shot in the head and strung up on a crucifix for all to see, the body of a suspected murderer is paraded in a town square for people to take pictures on mobile phones.

The man was accused of 'purposefully killing a Muslim to take his money' in a Sharia court set up by terror cell The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria who have overrun the city of Raqqa, northern Syria.

Such a crime, according to Sharia doctrine, is punishable by death, but how he should be executed is less specific.

In this man's case, he was blindfolded and led from the court to the city's centre and shot in the head at point-blank range.

His lifeless body was then tied to wooden cross on a makeshift stage and left in the sun for all to see.
