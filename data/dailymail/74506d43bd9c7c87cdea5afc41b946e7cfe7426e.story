Investigators for a House committee learned yesterday that ex-Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner's hard drive was merely 'scratched' and data was not 'unrecoverable,' as previously claimed by the IRS.

The House Ways and Means Committee also said it is now uncertain as to whether Lerner's hard drive was actually recycled, per previous IRS testimony, or 'shredded' as a court filing states, after reviewing the agency's IT logs, which list the hard drive at one point as having been 'recovered.'

'It is unbelievable that we cannot get a simple, straight answer from the IRS about this hard drive,' Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp said in a statement on Tuesday.

Congressional investigators have learned that former Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division head Lois Lerner's hard drive was scratched but not damaged beyond all recovery, as the IRS claimed

Ways and Means investigators made the discoveries after talking with IT professionals at the government agency who the committee claims were not previously made available for interviews.

In the course of its probe into the IRS' targeting of conservative organizations, the committee says, it also ascertained that IT employees who worked on Lerner's hard drive recommended that it be reviewed by outside experts but the government agency declined to take their advice.

If the IRS had sought outside counsel, it would have likely realized that the data from Lerner's damaged hard drive was most likely recoverable, the committee said on Tuesday after speaking to numerous law enforcement and Department of Defense forensic experts.

The new information 'raises more questions about 
potential criminal wrong doing at the IRS,' Camp said.

'If the IRS would just come clean and tell Congress and the American people what really happened, we could put an end to this,' he argued.

'Our investigators will not stop until we find the full truth.'

Ways and Means is not the only congressional committee investigating the IRS for targeting conservative groups.

A separate investigation being conducted by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is looking into the IRS' failure to inform Congress in a timely manner that Lerner's hard drive had crashed.

In interviewing Thomas Kane, the IRS Deputy Associate Chief Counsel for Procedure and Administration, last week, the committee determined that the IRS knowingly kept the crash from Congress for four months.

In partial testimony from Kane released on Monday, the IRS employee says that the agency knew in early to mid February about the hard drive crash.

Yet, the IRS did not tell Congress about the crash until June, Republicans investigating the matter say.

In a letter to the Justice Department on Tuesday, House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa and Oversight Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Job Creation, and Regulatory Affairs Chairman Jim Jordan, both Republicans, asked the department to appoint an independent special prosecutor to investigate why IRS Commissioner John Koskinen hid the information from Congress for so long.

'Until we know all the facts,' Jordan said at a hearing on the matter this morning, 'the committee will continue to press for the truth.'

At the hearing Koskinen said that while Mr. Kane may have knew about Lerner's hard drive crash in February, but he did not know at that time.

When he did find out in April, Koskinen said he did not immediately tell Congress because he was waiting to find out if the IRS had backup tapes of Lerner's lost emails.

'My theory is this, you guys were never going to tell us until we caught you,' Jordan shouted at him, claiming that the only reason the IRS came clean was because of a Freedom of Information Act request filed by conservative organization Judical Watch.

'It seems to me that before you're going to make that sort of a charging claim,' Koskinen fired back, 'you'd better have evidence.'

Welcome back: Today's hearing marked the third time in the last month that IRS chief John Koskinen, right, was carted before the House Oversight Committee, led by Rep. Darrell Issa, right

Koskinen 
said he had no idea what was going on with the back up tapes of Lerner's
 emails at this juncture because the IRS Inspector General has taken 
over the internal investigation into the matter and has asked that he 
not interfere.

'At this point I have no information whether there's anything usable on those tapes,' Koskinen said.

Asked later by Rep. Trey Gowdy about a June 13 memo he sent to two Senators in which he 'confirmed
 that back-up tapes from 2011 no longer exist because they have been 
recycled' and if he was still 'confirmed', Koskinen said: 'At this point
 I have no basis for not being confirmed.

'At this point I know the IG is looking and hasn't found anything,' he said.

He
 also argued during the hearing it was not odd that Lerner and other 
targets of the congressional investigation had hard drive crashes, as 
300 IRS employees experienced hard drive crashes during the time period 
in question.

Today marked the fourth time this year Koskinen had been hauled before the Oversight committee to discuss the missing emails, and the third time in the last month.

The IRS chief said today that his agency had spent roughly $18 million  and between 100,000 and 120,000 hours responding to investigations into this matter. At one time or another, some 250 employees have been involved in the investigation, he said, it has become a 'significant distraction.'

The complaint was the subject of a letter from Oversight ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Democrat, to Issa on Monday.

'Requiring Commissioner Koskinen to testify 
again this week not only takes him away from the day-to-day duties of 
operating an agency with 90,000 employees, but it also diverts our 
Committee from conducting responsible oversight on many key areas that 
traditionally have been part of our jurisdiction,' Cummings said.

Cummings and the ranking member on the Oversight subcommittee used their opening statements at today hearing to denigrate Republicans leading the hearings in Oversight as well as Ways and Means for engaging in a 'taxpayer-funded foot race' to make headlines on Lerner's hard drive and slowing down the investigative process by not working together.

'So its' something like a children's fairy tale, that were looking at,' Rep. Matt Cartwright said.

'This is unseemly. This is embarrassing. And it is not a proper way to run an investigation or spend millions in taxpayer funds,' Cummings said.

Issa, chairman of the Oversight committee, responded to Cummings' comments by asking that he withdraw statements that 'disparage' him from his opening statement.

The committee's investigation 'should not lead to personal attacks,' he said. It is the responsibility of the committee to provide 'vigorous oversight,' Issa added.

In a statement yesterday, Camp blamed the Ways and Means committee's ongoing probe on the IRS' failure to provide all of the relevant information in a timely manner.

'It is these constant delays and late revelations that have forced this investigation to go on so long,' Camp said.
