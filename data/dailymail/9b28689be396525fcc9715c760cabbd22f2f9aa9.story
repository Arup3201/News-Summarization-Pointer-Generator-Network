A clutch of top Flat jockeys escaped costly bans on Monday after the Starter and Advance Recall Flag man were blamed for a false-start, void-race fiasco at rain-lashed Epsom.

Eight riders, including Ryan Moore and James Doyle, potentially faced a penalty which would have ruled them out of the final Classic, the St Leger at Doncaster.

But Epsom stewards decided that the reason for the failure for the jockey to respond to a false start in the third-race, the Totepool Supporting The Sport You Love Handicap in which Humidor passed the post first, lay with officials.

Fiasco: James Doyle leads Humidor to victory after eight runners ignored a false start at Epsom on Monday

While the Advance Flagman, responding to the Starter, waved his yellow Flag when Taurus Twins broke the stalls early, he took steps to his right and the jockeys claimed the did not see him with visibility poor.

He also failed to blow his whistle as is required by the rules.

As the operating procedures were not followed, the stewards decided that no action would be taken against the riders.

A report was forwarded to the British Horseracing Authority.

While some bookmakers stuck to their void race rules by re-funding stakes, others decided to pay out on the result.
