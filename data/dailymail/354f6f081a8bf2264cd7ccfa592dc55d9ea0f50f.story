Police are hunting a hit-and-run driver who left a seven-year-old boy fighting for his life after ploughing into a mother and her two children as they crossed a road.

The mother was holding the hands of her two sons, aged seven and four, when they were struck by a red Volkswagen Polo car.

The older boy was run over by the car and his brother was thrown about 20 yards up the road.

Scene: A seven-year-old boy is fighting for his life in hospital after being run over by a hit and run driver on this street in Bournemouth, Dorset

Witnesses said the woman driver got out, held her head in her hands and said 'oh my God, I can't believe it' before callously getting back in her car and speeding off.

The older brother suffered critical injuries and was rushed to hospital. His condition is not known. The younger sibling was injured in the collision and was in deep shock afterwards.

The mother was said to be 'distraught' at the scene and was comforted by members of the public.

Police drove off in the general direction as the Polo car and have now launched an urgent appeal for anyone who has seen it to come forward.

The driver is described as being white, aged between 40 and 50, about 5ft 3ins tall, and has shoulder length brown hair. She was driving a T or Y reg VW Polo.

The incident happened outside a library in Kinson, Bournemouth, Dorset, at 5.11pm yesterday afternoon.

The car involved was described as a T or Y registration red Volkswagen Polo (file picture for illustration purposes only)

Witnesses said the mother and two children were stood on a traffic island in the middle of the road when another car stopped to let them cross.

As they walked out, the Polo car drove down the inside of the other vehicle and careered into them.

A male witness, who was working nearby but didn't want to be named, said: 'The car came scooting along and ran over one boy and the other got bounced off the front wing.

'I ran out and called for an ambulance.

'The woman driver in the Polo got out and had her head in hands and said 'oh my God, I can't believe it'.

'The younger boy got up and was sat on the pavement in shock but the older one was lying in the road. The Polo had driven over him and stopped about 10ft away.

'He was in a pretty bad way. He was conscious but silent and wasn't moving very much.

'The ambulance crew put him on a stretcher and took him into the ambulance.

'The mother was literally holding the two boys' hands as they crossed the road. She was distraught.

'I wasn't paying much attention to the woman driver, just the child in the road. After about three or four minutes we noticed she and her car had she just disappeared.

The seven-year-old was rushed to Poole hospital (pictured). A police spokesman described his injuries as 'very serious'

'We heard the ambulance coming and we turned around and the car had gone. People thought she had just moved it but she just left the scene. It was after a few minutes so she must have thought about what she was doing.

'The police went after her in the general direction.'

The two boys were rushed to Poole Hospital.

Inspector Steve White, of Dorset police, said the older boy's injuries were 'very serious.'

He added: 'We are appealing for witnesses to come forward and in particular the driver of the vehicle to come forward and tell us what they know about the incident.'
