Brooke Mueller was rushed to hospital on Friday morning after an overdose, it has been reported.

The previous evening she was seen looking glassy-eyed as she stepped out of a car upon her arrival for dinner at Mr Chow.

However the troubled ex-wife of Charlie Sheen's publicist has spoken out to claim that no drugs were involved.

Instead, Steve Honig said in a statement that Brooke was mistakenly believed to be unresponsive while sleeping.

He told MailOnline: 'An assistant thought Brooke was non-responsive while she was napping and hastily called an ambulance.

'As a precaution, Brooke was brought to a local hospital and discharged after an hour. She was diagnosed with exhaustion and dehydration and is now fine and resting at home. That's it.'

The 35-year-old, who has a long history of drug abuse, was taken to a Los Angeles hospital in the late morning, according to TMZ.

The website reports that the Los Angeles City Fire Department informed them that Brooke was transported to the hospital from her Tarzana home at 11.42am.

Sources reportedly told the website that people around Brooke are 'deeply concerned' and allege that she has been taking drugs for several weeks, it has been claimed.

But Brooke is so determined to prove she was not on drugs, she told Radar Online: 'I am going back to the hospital to get the test results that will prove that I wasn't on drugs.'

For her meal out on Thursday night, Brooke went for a boho look, sporting a jewelled headband and a leather jacket, trousers and studded boots.

Brooke was placed on probation for one year after she plead guilty to possession of cocaine on March 19.

The Witchouse actress and mother-of-two has been in rehab multiple times.

Brooke married Charlie Sheen in May 2008 and gave birth to their twin sons Bob and Max nine months later.

Charlie filed for divorce from Brooke in November 2010, and the pair's divorce became effective the following June.

Meanwhile, the twins were reportedly being look after Mueller's live-in nanny during her hospital dash.

TMZ reports
that the boys stayed at Mueller's house with the nanny, who has lived 
in the household for several years, and did not go to their father 
Sheen's house nor were under the care of the actor's other ex-wife 
Denise Richards, who has looked after them in the past.
