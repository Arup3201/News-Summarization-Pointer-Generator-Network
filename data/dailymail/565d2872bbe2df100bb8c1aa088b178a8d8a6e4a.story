In another, she is a heavily pregnant mother-of-two preparing to welcome twin girls into her family.

And in a later snap, she is a beaming mother-of-four with noticeable baby weight and 'war wounds'.

Designer Joanna Venditti shared these inspirational and honest photos of herself - captured before, during and after her three pregnancies - in a bid to show how childbirth changes women's bodies.

She posted them on her blog, Nesting Story, this month, alongside an explanation of how she initially struggled to deal with her enormous stomach, subsequent baby weight and post-pregnancy scars. 

But after reflecting on what her body had achieved, she gradually 'learned to love' the changes that childbirth brought - and no longer feels her pregnancies 'ruined' her body, she writes on the blog.

Now, Mrs Venditti is focused on celebrating her  journey from being a women who aimed to 'turn heads' and a 'vessel' for her unborn children to, finally, a proud mother with curves and pregnancy 'wounds'. 

'Isn’t it incredible what the human body can do? Or better yet, what a woman’s body can do? I have had four children, including twins, in the span of five years. Yes, my body did that!,' she writes.

The 32-year-old, from Ontario, Canada, adds: 'I am the thirty-something mom now with four kids and I am really proud of that. I am so much more confident with my body than I ever have been before.

'Anytime I start doubting my new curves or war wounds I look around the room and ask myself, how many other people in this room grew two people inside their body at once?'

While she has come to terms with her new body, Mrs Venditti - who weighs around 140lbs seven months after her twins Mia and Everly's birth - says she is working to lose her baby weight.

However, she told TODAY Parents that she is taking her time to return to her target 120lbs - and is mainly concerned with being 'fit and healthy'. 'I’m not looking to be rail thin,' she told the site.

On her blog, Mrs Venditti says she reached her goal weight in college after 'being a little bit on the heavy side' as a child. She admits her sole, 'pretty shallow' purpose back then was to 'turn heads'.

'I was already dating my now-husband Mike, and knew that he would love me whatever size I was, but I still craved walking into a room and having all eyes on me,' writes the designer and artist.

Proud mom: Mrs Venditti says she was terrified when she found out she was expecting twins. 'I couldn’t wrap my mind around how enormous I was going to get,' the mother-of-four writes in her widely-read blog post

During her first two pregnancies, Mrs Venditti, who weighed around 125lbs before both, experienced fast and easy deliveries. She gained 50lbs with each of the babies and lost the weight within months.

But, she says, she was terrified when she found out she was expecting twins. 'I couldn’t wrap my mind around how enormous I was going to get,' Mrs Venditti writes in her widely-read blog post.

'I was already well known for having huge basketball size bellies whenever I was pregnant, but growing two babies at once??? To be honest, I was kind of freaking out about it.'

Mrs Venditti, who lives with her family near Toronto, says her fear was only heightened by the many ultrasounds and blood tests that she was required to undergo, all of which came with multiples.

Whenever it got too much for her, she would repeat to herself: 'You are a vessel, you are a vessel'.

Mrs Venditti, who weighed 190lbs at her heaviest, gave birth to her twins via cesarean section at 37 weeks. 

She says she was left with a 'bruised and battered' body, with 'swollen ankles' and scars.

She also suffered severe pain in her upper torso from her organs stretching to accommodate Mia and Everly. 

The pain meant she could not lie down, forcing to her to sleep while sat up for a week.

'I told my husband, I don’t feel like myself,' Mrs Venditti said. 'This adorable cute belly that would distract everyone was gone and you’re left with the remains. I did feel sad, I almost mourned.'

However, after reflecting on her body's incredible journey, she eventually came to love it. And if she ever has a moment of insecurity, she reminds herself of her accomplishment of having twins.

Having fun: Mrs Venditti's blog post, 'What Having Four Kids (Including Twins) Has Done To My Body And My Confidence', has been deemed 'refreshingly honest' and 'inspiring'. Above, the mom with one of her children

The mother-of-four now tries work out each morning in a bid to tone her muscles. She hopes to increase her back strength for when she picks up her babies, and wants to enhance her flexibility.

'No more pulling my neck while reaching for a pacifier that has fallen under a crib,' she says. And while she tries to eat healthy foods, she doesn't 'beat herself up' when she 'indulges here and there'.

Mrs Venditti's blog post, 'What Having Four Kids (Including Twins) Has Done To My Body And My Confidence', has been deemed 'refreshingly honest', 'open', 'encouraging' and 'inspiring'.

A subscriber named Angela wrote: 'Love this post. Your honesty is refreshing! And you look beautiful at every stage in your adult life. The whole time I was reading this I was thinking…WOW, not only is it amazing what the female body can do, but look how quickly it changes in just a matter of months!'

Before motherhood: While Mrs Venditti tries to eat healthy foods, she doesn't 'beat herself up' when she 'indulges here and there'. Above, she is seen before becoming a mother (left) and on her wedding day (right)

Meanwhile, another called Jessica said: 'This spoke to me, thank you! I was always encouraged to be fit but thin (I modeled and was a dancer). However, I am now pregnant for the first time with twins and at just 14 weeks, I am measuring 22.5 already.

'I have been able to focus on growing my babies, but would be lying if I said I didn’t worry about what will be left at the end. So thank you for this!'

And one wrote: 'Reading this felt like reading my own story! I had my two older kids and now have 2 1/2 month old twins. And wow. What your body goes through to carry and birth twins is crazy.'
