Sitting in the stands watching Jamaica’s ‘Sunshine Girls’ play netball on Wednesday was Usain Bolt. These Commonwealth Games needed an icon and it is this man, the superstar holder of six Olympic gold medals.

He chewed gum, waved a Jamaica flag and talked with his little clique, including his attack-dog of an agent, Ricky Simms, and his friend from school, Nugent Walker Junior, known as NJ, his Man Friday.

Bolt scurried off with his retinue after the match ended in a 50-42 loss to New Zealand, rushing past the reporters shouting one word: ‘Awesome.’ It was intended as his verdict on these Games, a sentiment he retweeted in full charm-offensive mode later in the day.

Loving life: Usain Bolt waves a Jamaican flag during the 'Sunshine Girls' game at the SECC in Glasgow

The only problem is that a day before, while waiting for his car in rain outside the athletes’ village, he was seemingly more candid, giving the opposite view. He derided the Games as a ‘bit s***’ and said he was ‘not really’ having fun.

Those words, taken down in contemporaneous notes, appeared in The Times on Wednesday morning.

The story prompted Bolt to tweet: ‘I’m waking up to this nonsense… journalist please don’t create lies to make headlines.’

Mike Hooper, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, told the daily press briefing: ‘I think Usain’s tweet has said it all. I take his word that it is lies.’ That seemed a touch complacent, dismissing a reputable publication so readily in deference to the event’s leading man.

To try to elicit some sort of clarification, I walked up to the spare seat next to Bolt and introduced myself, reminding him that we had met briefly in Kingston, Jamaica, a couple of years ago. Before he had a chance to respond, security heavies manhandled me out of the way, one of them ripping my accreditation from around my neck. 

So much for the Friendly Games.

This furore is extremely sensitive for the organisers because Bolt has a multi-million pound deal with Virgin Media, who are the ‘official presenting partner of athletics’.

His image is plastered on Virgin billboards across the city, including on the main road to Hampden Park, where he is expected to run in the 4x100metres relay. On Glasgow Green, spectators have the chance to run against a hologram of Bolt, courtesy of… Virgin.

The gangly Jamaican is the man in demand. So when he arrived on Saturday he was whisked straight to a press conference, where the fawning was on an industrial scale. 

The nadir was Roz Kelly, who works for Australian TV, saying she and her crew were there ‘as fans’ and wanted a selfie with him.

Bolt has posed for pictures with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, as well as with the mascot, Clyde. He is the one athlete with global reach. No wonder the organisers were so keen to take his side on Wednesday.

However, this storm has not blown out. The journalist who broke the story, Katie Gibbons, is ready to confront Bolt about his denial. There is also outrage among Glaswegians, a few of whom proposed a campaign to get punters to turn their backs on Bolt in the stadium.

I am not sure many, if any, will do that. The crowds here have been warm to competitors from all 71 nations. A cavorting, bow-and-arrow shooting Bolt up to his party tricks is unlikely to be a flop.

One caveat: there remains some doubt about whether he will compete at all, especially if it is wet. He is overcoming injury and decided not to take part in the individual sprints. 

The cynics would say he is doing the bare minimum to honour his commitments to Virgin.

Between massages on Wednesday, Bolt was training. However, for part of the relay handover session Kemar Bailey-Cole, the new Commonwealth 100m champion, was on the anchor leg that Bolt is supposedly due to run. The plot thickens.

Speaking out: Kemar Bailey-Cole, who won 100m gold, has also criticised the Glasgow Games

If Bolt did criticise the Games, he would not be alone. Take Bailey-Cole, who said the food needed more seasoning and ‘wasn’t as good as London’. Jason Livermore, who was sixth in the 100m, was similarly underwhelmed, saying: ‘Usain’s somewhere in the village. I hope he’s having a better time than me.

‘The food? Oof. Back in Jamaica it’s not like this. I need to get me some clothes. It’s freezing.’ Actually, by Scottish standards, it has been positively balmy. It was 27 degrees at the triathlon last week.

There is plenty to enjoy. The streets have a carnival feel. The competition is keen, some of it of outstanding quality. They have sold 1.2million tickets, a roaring trade.

They are night-and-day compared to Delhi’s chaotic staging of this jamboree four years ago, made memorable by dengue fever, collapsing buildings, stray dogs, spit-infested sinks and the chief medical officer going down with typhoid.

Bolt missed those Games because they came too late in the year to fit in with his schedule. 

Take it from me, Mr Bolt, Glasgow 2014 is a doddle and a joy.
