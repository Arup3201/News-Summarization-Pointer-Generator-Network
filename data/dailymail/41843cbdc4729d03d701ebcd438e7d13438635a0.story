Sixty-eight years after she was left on the doorstep of a western Michigan family's home, Julie Himebaugh is still trying to discover the identity of her parents and why her mother decided to give her up.

Ludington police said this month they no longer have records of the discovery of the baby on May 7, 1946. But the Detroit Free Press reported Sunday stories in several newspapers at the time paint a detailed picture of the baby's discovery.

Himebaugh was about 6 months old when she was left, authorities said. A note from a woman identifying herself as the mother said the father was a soldier killed in World War II and said she was unable to care for the baby.

''Insatiable curiosity': Julie Himebaugh, 68, of Elizabeth City, North Carolina learned in 1999 that she was abandoned as a 6-month-old girl on the porch of a family in Ludington, Michigan. Since then, Himebaugh has used a range of approaches, including DNA testing, to discover the story about her unknown birth parents--all to no avail

Himebaugh now lives with her husband in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.

Newspaper stories told the tale of the doorstep baby, detailing the efforts that went into trying to find her mother. The Pere Marquette car ferry was monitored closely. An ad was put in the Ludington Daily News asking for information.

A probate judge made an appeal in the Ludington newspaper, asking the child's mother to come forward to sign off on rights in order to speed a potential adoption. Nothing worked.

'It's hard to believe all of this was done because of me. I caused a whole lot of commotion,' Himebaugh said.

Shocking details: Himebaugh only learned of the way she was abandoned after petitioning for her adoption papers in 1999. They showed the name state workers had given her at random, Marlene Madison, before her adoption. She later learned the pinned to her on the porch was a note indicating her birth mother was intent on killing herself

Newspaper accounts said a note pinned to the blanket-wrapped baby said the parents ran away and married and had a happy home before the father left for the Army, then was killed.

'I'm just grieving my life away, so I have decided to end it all by taking my own life,' the letter said. 'Please keep this quiet and do not have it printed in papers as I should never want my baby to know what has happened.'

Shockingly, Himebaugh didn't learn about her true origins until 1999, when she petitioned for adoption records after the death of her adoptive parents.

'It blew my mind,' she told the Detroit Free Press.

Since then, Himebaugh has pursued DNA and other leads, but has had no luck.

Her daughter, Laura McCombie of Accokeek, Maryland, said it would bring peace of mind to have some information.

'She just runs into roadblock after roadblock after roadblock. I don't want her to just give up,' McCombie said. 'I want her to follow through.'

Himebaugh and her husband visited Michigan this month in the hopes of finding new clues in the mysteries.

She's also done DNA testing, through which Himebaugh found a second cousin, but the lead led to nowhere.

'I would just like to know what happened, and know if I have siblings out there. I had a great adopted life. I couldn’t have asked for better parents and sister and brothers.

'It was just wonderful. But I have an insatiable curiosity. I just wish I could find something out, or that someone would come forward,' she said.
