Melissa Brittle, 38, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for failing to report the abuse of her grandson

A Maryland woman who stood by while her husband horrifically whipped, shook and kicked his grandson to death has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Prosecutors say Melissa Dawn Brittle, 38, of Thurmont, Maryland, encouraged husband Raymond Brittle to punish two-year-old Robert Dean Watkins - who was staying with the Brittles and their three children at the time. 

Robert died in a Washington, DC, hospital on September 8, 2013 following injuries that State's Attorney Charlie Smith called the most horrific he has ever seen, according to the Frederick News-Post. 

Mrs Brittle waited until the next day to take the unconscious boy to the hospital. She told police that Robert had fallen down the stairs.

Mrs Brittle's lawyer argued that she was terrified of her emotionally abusive husband and intimidated into covering up his violence against little Robert. 

Defense attorney Mary Drawbaugh told Daily Mail Online that Brittle had no job, no high school diploma and no driver's license.

'We adamantly denied that she encouraged the child in any way,' Mrs Drawbaugh said.

Raymond Brittle has admitted to horrifically beating two-year-old Robert Dean Watkins to death in September 2013. The Brittles were looking after the boy for his mother

'She did come clean and cooperated with police and did facilitate a call to her husband in which he confessed to the crime.' 

Drawbaugh asked for a 12-year sentence, the lowest end of the sentencing spectrum for the case, arguing that Mrs Brittle helped bring about her husband's guilty plea and had been prepared to testify against him.

Mrs Brittle faced up to 40 years in prison under a state law that says failing to report child abuse also constitutes child abuse. A judge on Wednesday ordered her held for 20 years, with 20 years suspended.

Raymond Brittle has also pleaded guilty in the child abuse case and faces 55 years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced next week. 

Prosecutors say he routinely beat and battered Robert while he was caring for his grandchild. 

On September 5, he became enraged at the boy when he wouldn't eat dinner. He whipped the children with a belt and kicked him. 

Investigators say he also lifted the boy by his head and shook him. 

An autopsy found that most of the boy's body was covered with bruises. 

He also had a fracture that covered three quarter of his skull and the injuries caused his brain to shift.
