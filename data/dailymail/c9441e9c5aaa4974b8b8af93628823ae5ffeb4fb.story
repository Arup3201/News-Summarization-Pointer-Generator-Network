Traditional British dog breeds such as deerhounds, otterhounds, Lancashire heelers and Welsh terriers risk becoming extinct as they are forced out by trendy canines like bulldogs and pugs.

The Kennel Club has 25 native breeds on its ‘vulnerable’ list, including many breeds of countryside dogs. 

Their original roles in agriculture are no longer needed while the popularity of small ‘handbag’ dogs has soared.

The vulnerable status covers breeds with fewer than 300 puppy registrations in a year. 

No otterhound puppies at all were listed in the first quarter of 2014 and the figure for Lancashire heelers, which were used to nip at cattle’s feet during herding, was only 32.

There were 31 Clumber spaniel puppies listed, 16 Sealyham terriers, 96 Welsh terriers and 68 deerhounds.

In contrast, there were 2,119 French bulldogs registered, up nearly half on 2013. 

Famous owners of this breed include the Beckhams, Millie Mackintosh and Hugh Jackman.

The figure for pugs was 1,921, up a tenth on 2013, while 1,565 long and smooth coat Chihuahuas pups were registered.

Dr Bruce Fogle, father of TV presenter Ben and a vet in London, urged the Kennel Club to relax its rules to let dogs not registered as a breed to mate with those which are.

Secretary Caroline Kisko said the Kennel Club was working to increase awareness of historic breeds and to bring in dogs from abroad if this was beneficial.
