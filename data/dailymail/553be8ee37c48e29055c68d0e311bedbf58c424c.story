He may be vying for support for the 2016 presidential election, but when it comes to grandchildren he outruns them all.

Mitt Romney has welcomed his 23rd grandchild into the world.

On Monday, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts and his wife took to Twitter to gush about the birth of their latest - a fifth child for their son Craig and his wife Mary.

And despite often losing count of the vastly-expanding brood, he took to Twitter to assure people this is number 23 for real.

'Excited to welcome another blessing into our lives: grandbaby #23 is here (really this time),' Mitt said, adding: 'Congrats Craig & Mary!'

Craig and Mary Romney, who already have two older sons and a pair of twins, added a girl to their clan.

Ann Romney announced the joyous news on Twitter on Sunday evening.

She wrote: 'Lucky us! Mary in labor and we get to hang out with her four littles cc @MittRomney'

Around 24 hours later, she posted a photo of her and the newborn in the hospital.

'Simply in love with our new granddaughter,' she wrote.

Can't keep count! The Romneys sent out this picture as a Christmas card at the end of 2014 with 22 kids

Family holiday: Earlier in the year, they posted this summer picture with the children in matching clothing

At 25, Craig Romney is the youngest of the governor’s five sons. 

All five Romney boys had actively campaigned for their father in his bid or the White House, taking part in fundraisers and stump events nationwide. 

Craig's role in the enterprise was Mitt's ambassador to Latino voters since he speaks Spanish.
