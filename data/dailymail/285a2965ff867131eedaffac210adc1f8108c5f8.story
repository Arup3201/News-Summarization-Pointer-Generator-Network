The deceased have not been named by police while next-of-kin were being informed.

Police refused to be drawn on whether the case was a murder inquiry amid
speculation that one of the couple may have killed the other before 
taking their own life.

Detectives have said they are not seeking anyone else in connection with the deaths.

DCI
Jon Hutchinson from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire 
Major Crime Unit, who is leading the investigation said:

'Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding this tragic 
incident however we can confirm that we are not looking for anyone else 
in connection with it.'

A spokesman said the force would not release any more details at this early stage in the investigation.

One neighbour, who didn't wish to be named, said she had seen several police cars outside the property at around 6.30pm Friday night.

She added: 'I drove past again later that evening around 8.30pm and saw forensics going into the house.

'It's not a particularly close neighbourhood and the house is quite a few doors away from me so I don't know who they were.'

Other neighbours reported seeing a forensic tent erected outside the property but did not know who lived there.
