Departed: Jo Shuter has resigned as headmistress a week after a report into her spending at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy was published

A ‘super head' who spent more than £30,000 of public funds on extravagant parties and hotel rooms, today quit after months of speculation about her conduct.

A report on Jo Shuter's behaviour released last week is said to have made her position 'untenable'.

The report said the former head teacher 
of the year, who was honoured with a CBE in 2010, failed to ‘avoid waste
 and extravagance’ and funding for the school’s 1,400 pupils, aged 11 to
 19, was ‘diverted for inappropriate purposes’.

According to the Camden New Journal, Miss Shuter has resigned despite being reinstated to her post with just a written warning a week ago.

The head was suspended last September from the Swiss Cottage school over allegations of financial irregularity.

She today said: 'It is with sadness and regret that I 
have taken the difficult decision to tender my resignation.

'My 11 years of headship have been a 
source of pride and happiness.'

Patrick Lees, chairman of the school's governing body, said: 'Whilst we 
as the governing body have reinstated Jo, following the publication of 
the EFA report last week Jo felt her position at QK had become 
untenable.'

Miss Shuter, of Dollis Hill, West London, spent almost £7,000 of school funds on her 50th birthday party.

She blew £6,957.49 on food and alcohol, special lights, landscaping, chair covers, flowers and paying workers.

Staff at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in north-west London also spent tens of thousands on taxis, flowers and luxury hotels in less than two years.

Some money has now been paid back, and the cost of the party was refunded in full – a year later.

The report by the Department for 
Education’s internal audit unit says Miss Shuter, named head teacher of 
the year in 2007, failed to be ‘economical’ with public funds.

It
 downgrades the school’s  financial self-assessment from ‘good’ to 
‘inadequate’, citing  two Government investigations between January 1, 
2011 and August 31, 2012, which found:

The report said Miss Shuter was 
expected to ‘avoid waste and extravagance’ and take personal 
responsibility for the ‘propriety and regularity’ of public funds.

It adds: ‘Clearly those 
responsibilities have not been discharged by Ms Shuter and proper 
financial control has not been exercised.’

Consultancy: Ms Shuter was paid up to £15,000 for her advice by other councils while she was on school time

Turnaround: Quintin Kynaston had been failing in 2001, but Ms Shuter transformed the school, being awarded two 'Outstanding' Ofsted reports

The school has been issued a financial notice to improve –  including recovering payments.

A DfE spokesman said: ‘The misuse of public money  meant for schools is completely unacceptable.

‘We are monitoring the situation closely and will take any further action necessary.’

A Metropolitan Police investigation into allegations of fraud and false accounting is ongoing. Nobody has been arrested.
