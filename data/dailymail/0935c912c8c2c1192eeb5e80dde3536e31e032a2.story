When he arrived months before his due date, he weighed only 1lb 11oz and spent months fighting to survive.

But yesterday the parents of baby Callum Alexander David Evatt paid tribute to their ‘little fighter’ who has finally been allowed to come home.

Callum was the same size as his teddy-bear when he arrived three months premature.

Home at last: Callum with parents Linzy McCreadie and Chris Evatt following a 71-day hospital stay

Callum was smaller than his teddy bear - and this glove - when he was born

He spent 71 days in the special baby care unit at the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife.

Now, first-time parents Linzy McCreadie, 29, and Chris Evatt, 33, of Strathmiglo, Fife, have finally been able to take their little boy home.

Callum now weighs 6lb 2oz, and even made it back home three days before his due date.

Miss McCreadie told how she had been at hospital for a check-up when things started to go wrong.

She said: ‘I went in because I had been having pains for three days but I didn’t realise I was in labour.

‘The next thing I knew my waters broke and his foot was out. They rushed me in for an emergency section.

So fragile: Baby Callum came into the world three months early

Parents Linzy McCreadie and Chris Evatt had to wait three days to hold their son for the first time

'I could have given birth naturally but it would have been risky for him and I wanted him to have the best chance.’

As a trained nurse, she knew how serious it was for her son to have arrived so early.

Doctors told Callum’s parents they were unsure if he would survive. Miss McCreadie added: ‘I didn’t get to see him until the following morning.

‘The first 24 hours were horrendous. I sat by his incubator, and it was day three before I got to hold him for the first time.’

Mr Evatt added: ‘He’s a little fighter, but if it wasn’t for the hospital staff he wouldn’t be here.’
