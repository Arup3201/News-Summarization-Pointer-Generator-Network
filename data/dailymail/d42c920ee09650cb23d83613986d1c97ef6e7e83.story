A healthy adult should be consuming something in the region of 2,000 calories a day, according to the Department of Health.

But a new photo series by the New York Times has revealed just what 2,000 calories looks like at some of the UK's favourite fast food chains - and it's often a lot smaller than you might think.

At Burger King you can fill half of you daily quota just by ordering a double whopper with cheese, while adding a side of onion rings and a vanilla milkshake takes you to 2,030 calories.

Burger King: A Double Whopper with cheese gets you halfway there at 1,070 calories. Onion rings (410 calories) and a vanilla milkshake (550 calories) bring the total to 2,030

Starbucks: To consume 2,000 calories, one would need to order a Java Chip Frappucino (460 calories), latte (190 calories), orange mango smoothie (270 calories), cheese toastie (580 calories), popcorn (125 calories) and a sausage croissant (410 calories)

McDonald's: You'd need to order a Crispy Chicken sandwich with bacon (750 calories), fries (340 calories), Coke (200 calories) and a McFlurry with Oreos (690 calories) to hit that 2,000 mark

At McDonald's a modest-sized lunch of a Crispy Chicken sandwich with bacon (750 calories), fries (340 calories), Coke (200 calories) and a McFlurry with Oreos (690 calories) will see you over the 2,000-a-day limit.

The same applies to Pizza Hut, where a Meat Lover’s Stuffed Crust pizza is 880 calories. Add a soft drink at 440 calories, baked chicken wings with dip (340 calories), and two cookies (360 calories) and you've met your daily quota.

Chipotle may not have been on UK shores for long, but it is also deceptively easy to hit your daily quota here, largely thanks to the carnitas burrito which has 945 calories all by itself.

Add in some nacho chips and guacamole (770 calories) and a Coke (276 calories) and you're there.

Another new addition to the UK food scene, Shake Shack, has a similar problem, with the signature Double ShackBurger providing 770 calories. Adding in fries (470 calories) and a Black and White milkshake (760 calories) is enough to top the limit. 

Subway: A ham and turkey sub (375 calories), chips (230 calories), chicken noodle soup with croutons (155 calories), cookie (220 calories), Buffalo-chicken salad (360 calories), Coke (200 calories), egg-and-cheese flatbread (370 calories) and juice (100 calories) equates to 2,000 calories

At Chipotle you could hit 2,000 calories by ordering a carnitas burrito (945 calories, left), nacho chips and guacamole (770 calories) and a Coke (276 calories). At Shake Shack, the same could be achieved with a Double ShackBurger (770 calories), fries (470 calories) and a Black and White milkshake (760 calories)

It is slightly trickier to over-do it at Starbucks, but combining a Java Chip Frappucino (460 calories), latte (190 calories), orange mango smoothie (270 calories), cheese toastie (580 calories), popcorn (125 calories) and a sausage croissant (410 calories) will get you there.

As many sandwiches and salads at Subway clock in at under 400 calories, it is the additional items you need to watch out for. 

Here, 2,000 calories consists of a ham and turkey sub (375 calories), crisps (230 calories), chicken noodle soup with croutons (155 calories), a cookie (220 calories), Buffalo-chicken salad (360 calories), Coke (200 calories), an egg-and-cheese flatbread (370 calories) and juice (100 calories). 

Some of the dishes listed above are only available in the U.S., but most have their UK equivalents.

And here's what 2,000 calories looks like in America...

While over-indulging at UK food chains may give you your daily calories in one meal, in America it is easily possible to hit 2,000 calories by eating just one dish. 

At the Cheesecake Factory, for instance, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta clocks in at 2,370 calories - no drinks or sides required. 

At Sonic, all one needs is a Peanut Butter Caramel Pie Shake to consume 2,090 calories in one swift sitting, while a slice of Zuccotto cake at Maggiano's Little Italy is 1,790 calories all by itself (a cappuccino on the side would be an additional 220 calories).

Sonic: The chain's Peanut Butter Caramel Pie Shake contains a whopping 2,090 calories

IHOP: A Classic Skillet, with sausage contains 1,880 calories (the pancakes are included and served alongside the main dish). A glass of orange juice contains 110 calories

P.F. Chang's: A 2,000 calorie feast might include orange beef (565 calories), pad thai (580 calories), spinach (120 calories), dumplings (195 calories), caramel cake (430 calories) and wine (125 calories)

And while IHOP's Classic Skillet with sausage might appear to feed two (or even three), it is actually intended as a 1,880-calorie dish for one. A glass of orange juice at 110 calories brings it closer to a 2,000 total. 

One would really need to order a lot at Subway to hit 2,000 caloriesTwo-thousand calories also equates to a hearty feast at P.F. Chang's, including orange beef (565 calories), pad thai (580 calories), spinach (120 calories), dumplings (195 calories), caramel cake (430 calories) and wine (125 calories).

At Olive Garden, it doesn't take much effort to consume 2,000 calories. In fact, just a standard meal of a salad (150 calories), breadstick (140 calories), Tour of Italy sampler (1,500 calories) and a quartino of wine (230 calories) will do it.

At Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, you could achieve the same result simply by ordering the Cowboy Ribeye steak (1,690 calories) and a martini (230 calories).

Olive Garden: A salad (150 calories), breadstick (140 calories), Tour of Italy sampler (1,500 calories) and a quartino of wine (230 calories) contains a total of 2,020 calories

Maggiano's Little Italy: Don't order a main, don't even order a starter. This slice of Zuccotto cake is 1,790 calories all by itself. A cappuccino on the side would be an additional 220 calories
