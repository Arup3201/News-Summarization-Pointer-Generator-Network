Next time Mitt Romney pats Rick Perry and tells him to calm down, he might remember that his opponent once shot a coyote with laser-sighted pistol.

Texas Governor Mr Perry has insisted the story he told last year about shooting dead the animal during a morning jog near Austin is true.

The GOP presidential candidate said he needed just one bullet from his .380 Ruger to kill the coyote that menaced his puppy in February 2010.

‘One guy from upstate New York said (it could not have happened because) “coyotes would run away”,’ he told Parade magazine.

‘Come to Austin. I’ll show you coyotes that will come and get in your backyard and eat your little puppy.’

He said last year that he carries his gun when jogging on trails because he is afraid of snakes and had also seen coyotes in the undeveloped area.

One rushed to his daughter's Labrador retriever, and he charged. ‘Don't attack my dog or you might get shot - if you're a coyote,’ he said last year.

He described coyotes as ‘very wily creatures’ and said they are causing people in one area southwest of Austin to lose cats and dogs 'all the time'.

Mr Perry was not required to file a report about discharging a weapon, a department of public safety confirmed after the incident last year.

Texas Governor Rick Perry

Mr Perry has been a hunter for decades. When he was a Texas state legislator, he would fly to hunting camps in different parts of the state.

Former Massachusetts governor Mr Romney said in 2008 he had been 'a hunter pretty much all my life'. But he had reportedly only been out a handful of times.

He backed the 1994 Brady gun control bill, supported the state's strict gun control laws and signed one of the nation's tougher assault weapons laws.

Mr Perry's love affair, on the other hand, has manifested itself as a record of easing restrictions on carrying guns in Texas.
