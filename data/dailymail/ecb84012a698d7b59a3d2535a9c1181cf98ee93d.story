Joe Allen says Liverpool will be hoping Steven Gerrard can inspire them to the knockout stages of the Champions League - 10 years on from his historic heroics against Olympiacos.

Needing victory to progress from the group stages a decade ago, the Reds were trailing 3-1 at home to their Greek opponents before Gerrard scored a late stunning volley to seal the dramatic comeback.

Only a win for Liverpool at home to Basle on Tuesday will see Brendan Rodgers' side reach the last-16 of this season's Champions League and Allen hopes their inspirational captain can rekindle a similar performance to what he produced in 2004.

'It's a great position to be in. We know the task that lies ahead,' Allen said at the club's pre-match press conference on Monday.

'The players are ready to give it everything to get that result. We are looking to draw inspiration from previous games. The support we will get will be a huge factor. We want to make it a very difficult night for Basle and we call on our supporters to get behind us. We learnt a harsh lesson in the away match. We have moved forward since that game and we don’t think there will be any surprises.

'It was great that Stevie has that experience. It is a game for all of us to be inspired by. He is an icon figure, an inspiration. He is a huge player to have in our team and hopefully we will see some more magic from Stevie.

'It was great to qualify and get back into this competition. That is the dream of everyone in the football club to make the stage and we can’t wait for the game to get under way.

'Last year we learnt so much as a group. This is the type of game we will use our experiences from those games we played at the end of last season. 

'It is a game that when the groups came out we could get three points and nothing has changed. We just have to make sure we do our job and get three points.'
