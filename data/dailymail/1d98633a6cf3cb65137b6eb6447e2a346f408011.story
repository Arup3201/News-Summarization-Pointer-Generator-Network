Spot the Dog author Eric Hill, whose mischievous yellow puppy delighted children in sixty languages, has died at the age of 86.

The London-born illustrator sold 60 million copies of the books after inventing the lift-the-flap concept which now permeates children's fiction.

And in 2008, he was awarded an OBE for services to literature.

Ingenious: Eric Hill, who has died aged 86, was hailed as a 'master of simple design' for creating Spot

Hailing him as a 'master of simple design', publisher Puffin paid tribute to Mr Hill, who died at home in California following a short illness.

Francesca Dow, who runs Penguin’s children’s division, said: 'He created one of the world’s most 
loveable children’s book characters - Spot, the charming, naughty, 
playful puppy, loved and appreciated across the world.

'Eric’s
 ingenious lift-the-flap device turned the reading of a Spot book into a
 glorious game of hide and seek, enjoyed by children and adults alike.

'Puffin is proud to publish Eric Hill and will ensure Spot continues to delight children for generations to come.'

Iconic: In 2010, Where's Spot was turned into a variety of special edition lift-the-flap books over the 34 years

Honoured: In 2008, Mr Gill was presented with an OBE for services to children's literature by Prince Charles

Eric Hill, born in Holloway, north London, was evacuated during the Second World War, but returned as soon as he could before the war ended.

He became an assistant in an illustration studio.

In the 1940s, he took up a job in advertising, which led to him becoming a creative director and illustrator.

It was 1979 when he was experimenting with an advert featuring a lift-the-flap function that Mr Gill realised how much it excited his son Christopher - then aged three.

He decided to create Spot.

At first, publishers were reluctant to run the new-fangled design, but when Where's Spot was released in 1980 it was an instant hit.

It was soon followed by another hit - Spot's First Walk - and then, in 1983, an animated series, The Adventures Of Spot.

He was involved in every script and frame.By the 1990s, the books had been translated in 60 different languages.

The books follow Spot, a yellow puppy with brown spots and a brown-tipped tail, and his adventures with his parents, grandparents, brother and sister - plus a conglomerate of animals including a crocodile and a hippo.

The franchise began in 1980, with the release of Where's Spot, and became an instant success.

Soon, audiobooks - narrated by The Vicar Of Dibley's Jane Horrocks - and an animated TV series followed.

In a statement, his family said they would miss him 'immensely'.

They said: 'Although this time of loss is a great hardship for us, we can honestly say that we take some solace in the joy he brought to so many children and families through his work.

'We know Spot, and therefore Eric, has had a beloved presence in so many homes and bedtime readings. And we know we share our grief with many.'

Mr Hill, who avoided publicity and often referred to himself as Spot’s Dad, started out as an errand boy in an illustration studio.

He then ventured into a career in advertising before creating the best-selling puppy-dog picture books.

Determined to 'widen' children's perspectives, and credit them with more intelligence than adults believe, he deliberately set out to use unusual colours and unconventional objects.

He moved to the United States with his family in the 1980s.

He is survived by his wife Gillian, their son Christopher and his daughter Jane, all of whom are involved in continuing Spot's legacy.

Diverse: The playful stories were translated into 60 languages - including Welsh - within a decade
