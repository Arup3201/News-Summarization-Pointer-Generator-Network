Mike Freer has accidentally sent an email to protesters in which he called them 'numb-nuts' and the police 'daft'

A Tory MP has called police 'daft' and branded demonstrators 'numb-nuts' in an email accidentally sent to a protest camp on his own doorstep.

The email was reportedly meant for a member of Mike Freer's staff but he accidentally copied in members of the Occupy group who were camped on the driveway of his constituency office.

Mr Freer, MP for Finchley and Golders Green, has been involved in a week-long standoff with six activists who are opposed to his anti-squatters stance.

They had been outside his office on Ballards Lane, Finchley - Margret Thatcher's former constituency HQ - since Friday last week but have since been evicted.

According to reports, Mr Freer's staff initially allowed them to camp there to stop them blocking the pavement outside, but became frustrated and eventually hired bailiffs to remove them.

According to the Evening Standard, the email said: 'I am mightily peed off at the Police. I feel like sending the Bill to the Commissioner saying your fat advice landed us with the Bill.

'Of course this will inhibit every other demo as we will simply refuse to allow anyone onto our property. So tempting to say — you are all numb-nuts as I am not the owner of the property and it is they you should be dealing with about your presence.'

The 'bill' refers to the cost of hiring the private bailiffs used in the eviction.

Mr Freer helped to draft a bill which made squatting in residential building a criminal offence, a law which the protesters oppose.

Protester Pete Phoenix, 43, said: 'It isn’t a nice way to refer to your constituents. We have been politely co-operating with the police and we have been very respectful in our protest.

'We weren’t trespassing as he gave us permission. He has been disrespectful to people trying to have their say.'

The group, who have now moved across the road, say they plan to stay until Mr Freer joins them for a night to discuss their concerns.

It is understood the MP had previously emailed them and asked to meet, an offer they had agreed to.

The email was accidentally sent to them instead of being sent to a member of Mr Freer's staff

Speaking about the camp, Mr Freer said: 'The squatters and the camp were disrupting my constituency office and its presence was intimidating.

'A polite request for the squatters to leave was ignored as were instructions on how to arrange an appointment. It was decided that we had no alternative but to lawfully remove the squatters from the property.'

Last night 50 activists joined a demonstration at the new camp which was broadcast online.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the force would not comment on the email.

Mr Freer's office has previously said it would not be commenting on the message, and calls from Mail Online were not immediately answered.
