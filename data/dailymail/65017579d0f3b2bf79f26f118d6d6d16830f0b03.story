Each of Katy's looks were created by industry heavyweight, Pat McGrath, who was hailed by Vogue as the most influential make-up artist in the world.

Pop star Katy, who has previously designed her own range of make-up for the brand, even speaks in a variety of accents in the fun 44-second advert.

Writing about Katy on their website, the brand said: 'Singer, songwriter and actress Katy has blown up the pop scene and shows no signs of stopping.

Katy has never been afraid to experiment with her look and her latest advert is no different 

'From her chart-topping album One of the Boys to her hot new release Prism, this fresh-faced star embodies all of the elements that make up a stunning Covergirl.

'In addition to being the first-ever female artist in history to produce five number-one Billboard hits, she’s also the newest member of the Covergirl family because she truly defines inner and outer beauty.' 

Katy, who is known for experimenting with her look, adds: 'In addition to music, I've always considered makeup to be a powerful creative avenue for self-expression for me.'

The star also has her own range of accessories with Claire's and has designed several collections containing limited edition items, seasonal novelty pieces and collectables. 

It's been a busy few days for Katy, who performed at the Super Bowl wearing a dress with a flaming design as she rode a massive metallic tiger into the field.

She then took to the stage with backup dancers dressed as chess pieces before Lenny Kravitz arrived with his electric guitar to accompany the superstar as she performed a mash-up of her greatest hits.

She was also joined by special guest Missy Elliot. The icon belted out Get Ur Freak On as Perry danced next to her.
