Celebrated producer Shonda Rhimes — who created 'Grey's Anatomy' and 'Scandal' — has fired back at a New York Times TV critic who called her an 'angry black woman.'

The piece that got Rhimes fuming ran in the Times on Thursday, in a piece about the upcoming ABC show 'How to Get Away With Murder.'

TV critic Alessandra Stanley wrote: 'When Shonda Rhimes writes her autobiography, it should be called "How to Get Away With Being an Angry Black Woman."'

'Ms. Rhimes has embraced the trite but persistent caricature of the Angry Black Woman, recast it in her own image and made it enviable,' she added later.

Kerry Washington's Olivia Pope, from 'Scandal,' is one of the characters in Rhimes' shows that the piece claims embody the stereotype of the 'angry black woman'

Rhimes, 44, took Stanley to task for mistaking her for the creator of 'How to Get Away with Murder' — and for using the stereotype that is widely considered offensive to black women.

'Confused
 why @nytimes critic doesn't know identity of CREATOR of show she's 
reviewing,' Rhimes tweeted about Pete Nowalk, a white male who created the series.

She continued, 'Apparently we can be "angry black women" together, because I didn't know I was one either! @petenowa  #LearnSomethingNewEveryday'

Rhimes, 44, later added: 'Wait. I'm" angry" AND a ROMANCE WRITER?!! I'm going to need to put down the internet and go dance this one out. Because ish is getting real.'

The Internet — and actors in Rhimes' series — quickly reacted.

'Wow,' wrote Joshua Malina, who plays the prosecutor David Rosen on 'Scandal.'

'Did I just read a @nytimes piece that reduced my brilliant, creative, compassionate, thoughtful, badass boss to an “angry black woman?”

Bellamy Young, who plays First Lady Mellie Grant on the show, said the move was 'deeply upsetting.'

'I was shocked.Maybe I don't get something?' she tweeted.

Kerry Washington posted links to two articles decrying Stanley's controversial piece and added sarcastically: 'You're welcome.'

In response to the controversy, Stanley told BuzzFeed:
 'The whole point of the piece — once you read past the first 140 
characters — is to praise Shonda Rhimes for pushing back so successfully
 on a tiresome but insidious stereotype.'

This is not the first time Stanley takes a public beating over her work at the Times.

The paper in 2009 had to issue a correction for six different items in a piece Stanley wrote about Walter Cronkite's career — including the day that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, according to the Columbia Journalism Review.

She also once mistakenly wrote that the Iraq War began in 2002 and that the sitcom 'Everybody Loves Raymond' — at the time a hugely popular series — was called 'All About Raymond,' according to Gawker.
