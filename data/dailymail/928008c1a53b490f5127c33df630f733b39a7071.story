A dangerous arsonist left a mental institution in Latvia and travelled to Britain where he carried out a sex attack on a student.

Rolands Brize, 25, dragged his terrified victim under a bridge where he tried to rape her as she walked home from a nightclub, a court heard.

Police responding to a 999 call from the 23-year-old found Brize still trying to attack her.

Myton Bridge in Hull, where a 23-year-old student was attacked by Latvian national Rolands Brize, 25

Hull Crown Court heard Brize had been
a long-term patient in a mental health institute in the Baltic state 
after burning down his family home.

He came to England but re-entered the
institute after returning to Latvia. On his release, he again travelled
to the UK and settled in Hull.

Latvia has been a member of the EU since 2004 and Brize would have been free to move to the UK since then.

His victim had been to the Sugar Mill
nightclub in Hull and was walking home when she was followed by Brize, 
who had been refused entry to the club.

CCTV captured the woman carrying her high-heeled shoes in one hand and her handbag in another.

Brize grabbed her from behind and she screamed before managing to shake him off to call police from her mobile phone.

The 999 operator managed to calm the 
hysterical victim down enough for her to explain that a man was 
following her and had just tried to grab her.

'I am proud of the police call-taker and 
response team officers who worked together quickly, efficiently, and 
with great professionalism to enable the apprehension of the suspect'

While she was still connected to the 
emergency operator Brize grabbed her again and pulled her on to a 
footpath by the Myton Bridge over the River Hull.

The 999 operator, 
hearing the woman’s screams, alerted police.

But once officers arrived at the bridge all they found were her shoes and handbag, strewn across the pavement.

A search of the area revealed Brize attempting to rape his victim.

He was arrested and the woman was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary for treatment to cuts and bruises on her legs and back.

Detective Inspector Al Bentham, of 
Humberside Police Public Protection Unit, paid tribute to the victim for
keeping calm enough to give police enough details, despite the threat 
of attack.

He said: ‘Great credit must be 
attributed to the young lady involved as she courageously provided the 
police with sufficient details to be able to quickly locate her in 
horrendous circumstances.

‘Fortunately, this type of incident  is extremely rare within the city  of Hull.’

Detective Inspector Bentham also praised the 999 operator and the police officers who helped save the woman.

‘I am proud of the police call-taker 
and response team officers who worked together quickly, efficiently, and
with great professionalism to enable the apprehension of the suspect,’ 
he said.

Brize, of no fixed address, admitted 
attempted rape. He was remanded in custody and is due to return to court
next month for sentencing.

The honorary recorder of Hull and the
East Riding, Judge Michael Mettyear, said: ‘I have no problem 
adjourning the case for a psychiatric report.

‘He seems perfectly able to admit what he has done.’
