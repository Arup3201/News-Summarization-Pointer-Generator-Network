Kell Brook will end 18 months of waiting on Saturday night when he faces Shawn Porter for the IBF welterweight title in Carson, California.

Both Brook and Porter made the weight when the two weighed in on Friday night with the IBF champion coming in slightly heavier.

Unbeaten Sheffield fighter Brook tipped the scales at 146.5lbs while champion Porter was 146.75lbs.

Brook saw three projected title tilts at former champion Devon Alexander fall through then was forced to watch Porter get there first and dethrone Alexander over 12 rounds last April.

Ready to rumble: Unbeaten Kell Brook weighed in at 146.5lbs for his world title fight with Shawn Porter

Porter's subsequent four-round win over Paulie Malignaggi in April underlined the size of task facing Brook who heads into the fight with a 32-fight unbeaten record.

But the Sheffield man is convinced all the waiting will have been worth it when he gets in the ring for a bout which will leave the winner in a position to take any number of lucrative showdowns ahead.

Brook said: 'This has been a long time coming but I've finally arrived at the big stage now.

'It's every fighter's dream to win a world title and it's all I've been thinking about through training and waiting.

Somebody's 0 has got to go: Both Porter and Brook are unbeaten in their careers 

'I know Shawn Porter is a very tough customer and a very worthy champion, but this is my time. I'm very well prepared mentally and physically and Saturday night cannot come quick enough for me.'

While Brook has designs on a domestic super-fight against Amir Khan, Porter believes another headline win could put him in the frame for a meeting with Floyd Mayweather.

Porter's slow-burning career looked to have stalled when he fought a draw with veteran Julio Diaz in 2012, but a subsequent rematch win followed by his last two top-level performances have suddenly made him a man to be reckoned with.

Porter said: 'I am one of the quickest and strongest guys in my weight class and I'm probably the most confident too.

'I've done enough homework to know I can beat him. You're going to see it all - aggression, intelligence, power and quickness. The whole nine yards.'
