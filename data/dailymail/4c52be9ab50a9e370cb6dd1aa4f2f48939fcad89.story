He has forged a successful career amid the chaos and poverty of wartorn Somalia, but Hassan Farah cannot help wonder what might have been.

Hassan watched the television coverage with pride as identical twin brother Mo became a legend by scooping two Team GB golds on the running track at London 2012.

His sensational victories in the 5,000m and 10,000m – and trademark 'Mo-bot' celebration – have put Farah on course to earn millions of pounds in lucrative sponsorship deals.

Hassan – who was also a gifted runner –
was separated from Mo as an eight-year-old and is left to wonder what 
he could have achieved in athletics if he hadn't been forced to stay 
behind in the lawless East African country.

The 29-year-old twins were separated 
in 1991 when their parents made the agonising decision for Mo to join 
his father as an asylum seeker in Britain.

Mo Farah yesterday added a 
lucrative sponsorship deal with Virgin Media to his growing portfolio of
endorsement contracts as he reaps the rewards of his gold medals.

The 29-year-old will earn between 
£250,000 and £500,000 in an advertising campaign with fellow Olympic 
hero Usain Bolt. Both runners will wear Richard Branson goatee beards.

It will take the earnings of the winner of the 10,000m and 5,000m titles up to an estimated £2.5 million a year.

Before the Games, Farah earned a 
reported £500,000 in endorsements, including sponsorship deals with 
Lucozade and retail giant Nike.

Scottish Widows, the official 
pension provider for the Olympics, predicts he will pocket about 
£5 million by the Rio Games in 2016 – and he could command a £1 million 
appearance fee if he runs in the London Marathon next year.

Despite the grinding poverty Hassan 
has become a successful telecommunications engineer with a wife and five
children, and a comfortable home.

Hassan grew up amid dust and poverty 
and has watched without bitterness or resentment as his brother, who 
excelled on the sports fields of England, became a world-class athlete.

'Like many Somali families we were 
torn apart by war. In my case it felt more tragic than most. I feel I 
lost the other half of myself, my twin brother,' said Hassan, who for 
years clung to false assurances that he would follow Mo to Britain.

'Mo and I were on a par as runners. Sometimes I would beat him as we chased each other around, sometimes he would beat me.

'But now he has had the most 
technically-advanced training and advice available in the world, with 
top running tracks and gyms to work in, and I have had nothing.

'Who knows what I could have become? 
We could have been famous twin Olympic athletes. I couldn't help 
thinking about that when I was watching him in the races on television.

'But he's my brother, I love him and I rejoice in his great successes.'

Mo's phenomenal success followed years of rigorous training, after he was recognised as a major talent by his PE teacher.

He has been back to Somalia once, in 2003, but Hassan has never visited England.

Their mother Amran said: 'I would love to see my twin boys together again, of course I would.

'I can't talk about what happened all those years ago, I would just like to see them getting together at last.'
