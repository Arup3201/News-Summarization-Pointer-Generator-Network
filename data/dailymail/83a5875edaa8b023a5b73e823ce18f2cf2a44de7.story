First Lady Michelle Obama may not be pleased after her husband and Vice President Joe Biden went to a Shake Shack in Washington today for lunch and had burgers and fries.

President Obama had a burger and fries, while Biden had a cheeseburger, fries and a black-and-white milkshake. Mrs. Obama has been an outspoken advocate of healthy eating.

Obama and Biden had lunch with four people who are workers at a construction project in a gentrifying part of the city known as NoMa. The president has been on a recent push to promote improving the nation's infrastructure.
