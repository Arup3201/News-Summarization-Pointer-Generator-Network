Students at a Norfolk, Virginia, high school staged a walk-out Monday to protest a racially charged Twitter post mocking interracial couples, which has been sent out by a high-ranking school administrator who is white.

The social media message was shared by Booker T. Washington High School Assistant Principal Amy Strickland back in June, but it was only spotted on her page recently.

Miss Strickland, a recent hire at the predominantly black high school, retweeted a post from the satirical account @OrNahhTweets that featured a prom photo showing seven couples where all the women were white and all the young men were African-American.

Not funny: Mrs Strickland, a one-time Teacher of the Year, retweeted the image from the account @OrNahhTweets, along with the caption: ‘every white girl's father's worst nightmare Or Nah'

The image was accompanied by a caption that read: ‘every white girl's father's worst nightmare Or Nah?'

'I could have been any one of the boys in the picture,' Booker T Washington junior Michael LeMelle, who is African-American, told the station WAVY. 'And I really don’t see myself... as anyone’s worst nightmare.'

LeMelle was one of about a dozen students who walked out of their classes Monday to call the administration’s attention to the ongoing controversy.

For the past week, students at the school have been sharing among themselves screenshots of the incendiary tweet, which has since been deleted, along with Amy Strickland's account.

Students said that they have appealed to the faculty last week to look into the retweet, but their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. 

Norfolk School Board members told the news station Monday that they were unaware of the tweet until WAVY reached out to them for comment.

As for Miss Strickland, she has kept mum on the matter and has been staying out of the public eye, avoiding all meetings and public speaking engagements, according to students. 

Shakira Harris said that she and her classmates do not necessarily want Strickland fired, but they believe she deserves to be reprimanded for her poor judgement.

‘Do something to let us know it has not gone unnoticed,’ Harris pleaded.

Troubled school: The Norfolk, Virginia, high school lost its accreditation last month over poor test scores and low graduation rates  

Norfolk Federation of Teachers President Thomas Calhoun issued a statement Tuesday taking the school board and the Booker T Washington administration to task for allegedly dragging their feet.

‘Sometimes they seem to be hoping the problem will go away or maybe no one will notice,’ Calhoun wrote. ‘I feel everyone would be better served if they would address issues before the news media, the public, the staff, and the students get involved and form their own opinions of what is going on.’

The NAACP also has weighed in on the scandal, saying in a statement to WVEC 13NewsNow   that the civil rights organization has launched its own investigation into the controversy surrounding the racially insensitive tweet.According to her biography on Booker T Washington High School’s website, Amy Strickland, a graduate of Old Dominion University and Eastern Virginia Medical School, where she earned a Master's degree in public health, was hired as assistant principal earlier this year.After working in public health education for several years, Strickland switched gears in 2008 and became a science teacher and cheerleading couch in Portsmouth, where she led her team to 17 Eastern District and Conference titles.

This year, she won three Teacher of The Year awards, including the overall citywide award for Portsmouth.

Officials at Booker T Washington would not comment to the media on Miss Strickland’s current employment status, only saying that they are looking into the allegations.

The school, named after the legendary 19th century African-American community leader, educator and presidential adviser Booker T Washington, has more than 1,400 students enrolled in 9-12 grades, with 85 per cent of them black.

Last month, Virginia's Board of Education stripped the high school of its accreditation because it has failed to meet state minimum scores on the Standards of Learning tests and graduation rates for the past four years.
