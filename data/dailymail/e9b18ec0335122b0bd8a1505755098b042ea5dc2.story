Louis van Gaal declared himself 'angry' after seeing his Manchester United side fail to fire during their 0-0 draw at Cambridge United in the FA Cup fourth round.

The Red Devils boss watched on as his side struggled to break down their League Two opponents on Friday night, who deservedly secured an Old Trafford replay.

'Yes of course it is frustrating,' he said. 'We make the same error as against Yeovil Town and against QPR, we did the same playing style more or less in the first half.

'Then I have to be angry again. In the second half we did much better but OK we are not out of the Cup. That is the most important thing. But the atmosphere here, the crowd, was fantastic. You know always in advance that all aspects in a game like this is against you.

'I was angry again but it is part of my job. I want to be very happy at half-time. But OK it was not always the same.

'I can only give the credit to the coach, to the staff they did marvellous, but what I already said every aspect of the match is against us - the pitch, the referee, everything that you can think about this is against you. Also the fans of course, but that is nice I think.

'The FA Cup is very important - it is the most important title for us. To win the Premier League is much more difficult now, so the FA Cup is our objective also.'
