Ms Hickey's body was found at the Premier Inn in Kempston, south Bedford, just after 9am on Saturday.

Detectives were seeking Ms Hickey's partner - a man in his 30s - in connection with her killing when he was found dead at 5.30pm the same day after being struck by a train on a rail line at Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

Police said they were treating the deaths as a murder and suicide.

Writing on Facebook, Serena's brother Zane Hopkins said he planned to set up a charity to support people suffering domestic abuse.

He wrote: 'In the next few days, I shall be creating a new charity in aid of my sister, Serena Hickey, and all of our sisters and brothers who are victims of domestic violence.'

The man, who was found dead on railway lines at Nuneaton, Warwickshire, is believed to have killed Ms Hickey in a hotel room 70 miles away, police say

Mr Hopkins added: 'In addition, to not further hatred, I am going to create a place of understanding for the perpetrators of domestic violence, to re-educate them and help them to reform.

'Most importantly, we will provide the best care, compassion, and support for people who have been victims of this awful atrocity.

'We must unite to make sure this tragedy is never allowed to happen again. Unfortunately I wasn't able to protect my sister, but let me protect yours.'

It was understood that the couple had booked in together at the Premier Inn on Friday night.

Following the murder, part of the hotel was sealed off and a full-scale investigation launched.

A police spokesman said: 'Investigating officers received a call confirming a man had died on the railway line in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

'Scenes of crime officers undertook a full forensic examination of the area and detectives from the BCHMCU also attended the scene.

'Detectives believe the woman is from Milton Keynes and is the partner of the man found on the railway line in Warwickshire.

'A post mortem examination of the body of the man, who was believed to have been in his late 30s and from Nuneaton, will take place next week.'
