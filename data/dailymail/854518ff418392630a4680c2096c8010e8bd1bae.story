President Obama's decision to top by his press secretary's daughter's little league game has angered many D.C. residents after his motorcade added to the beltway's rush hour traffic.

The president paid a surprise visit Monday to Washington's Friendship Park, where a handful of teams were warming up for a big game and though he wowed the surprised sportsfans, he left many others enraged.

President Obama shook hands with the players and posed for photos with each team before trying out his pitching arm.

The performance off the mound, however, is what left commuters fuming as the baseball time out ended just as so many workers were headed home for the day.

'Consequences of living in DC, traffic stopped by Whitehurst Freeway for a motorcade,' Twitter user Meg Cerullo wrote while posting a picture of the bumper-to-bumper traffic.

'My campaign platform: No presidential clogging-up of major streets between hours of 8am and 7pm,' Washington-based New York Times reporter Annie Lowrey tweeted.

'UMM BARRY, YOU CAN'T BE COMING DOWN K STREET WITH YOUR ENTIRE MOTORCADE AT 5:19 PM CAUSING ALL THIS TRAFFIC!' another Twitter user with the handle @wamps27 wrote.

The pit stop at the playing fields lasted only 12 minutes but the traffic lasted much longer.

The President seemed unaware of the trouble his visit would cause the backlog, focusing his attention on the pint-sized players when he was on the field.

'What's going on people? How's it going?'
 the president said, before sidling up to a young girl whose arm was in a
 sling.

'Hey, what happened? Were you sliding?' he asked her.

One of the team's players is Della Carney - daughter of White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.

'Had to bring your dad to the game or he was going to be late,' the president reportedly explained, as he approached the team, reports ABC News.

Shocked parents reached for their smartphones to snap a quick photo, but not all of their kids were as impressed.

Some held back, unsure of who Obama was, as their parents tried to lure them back onto the infield to join the president.

'Oh
 my God, it’s the president!' one young player shouted as Obama walked 
out onto the Friendship Park Recreation Center, reports ABC News.

'Daddy, let's just play,' said one young boy, pulling his father by the hand.

The 'pitcher in chief' even got a chance to try out his arm, tossing the 
ball from near the pitcher's mound to 10-year-old Danny Ringel, who 
plays for the Tigers.

The 
White House notes the visit comes before Obama is scheduled to travel to
 Cooperstown, New York, on Thursday to speak at the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
That visit is focused on boosting U.S. exports, including tourism.
