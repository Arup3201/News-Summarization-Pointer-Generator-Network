Mesut Ozil is 'convinced' that he can win the Ballon d'Or within the next few years, as long as he continues to develop well at Arsenal.

The German World Cup winner has endured a turbulent time since his £42.5million move to the Emirates in 2013, but has rediscovered his form in recent weeks.

As Ozil continues to adapt to the 'physical test' of the Premier League, the creative midfielder believes he will one day reach the same level as the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.

The Arsenal midfielder hopes he can 'continue to develop and stay healthy' in a bid to win the coveted award

He told Sport Bild: 'If I continue to develop well and stay healthy, I would like, in the next few years, to hold the Ballon d’Or in my hands. I am convinced that it can happen.

'I’m feeling very positive. I’m a world champion and I play at a top club in the Premier League. 

'There is much more of a physical test here than there is in Spain or in the Bundesliga – I constantly have bruises, but that makes me harder. I feel physically better than ever.'

The 26-year-old, who is currently on international duty with Germany, hit the headlines for the wrong reasons last weekend after being spotted in a Berlin nightclub just hours after missing Arsenal’s Premier League victory against Newcastle because he had a cold.

Germany manager Joachim Low defended Ozil, claiming the midfielder had the permission of Arsene Wenger to fly to Berlin on Saturday.

'It's anyone's guess whether he was partying or not,' Low told reporters ahead of Wednesday's friendly against Australia.

'He has told me that he was in Berlin. I spoke to him and he said that he was weakened by a cold during last week and so Arsene Wenger and Ozil together took the decision to not play him at the weekend. After the match, he was allowed to fly to Berlin.'
