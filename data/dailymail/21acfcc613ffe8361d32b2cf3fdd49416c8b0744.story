A second skeleton 'from colonial times' has been discovered in the roots of a tree ripped up by Superstorm Sandy.

A woman who investigated an oak tree 
felled by high winds in the hurricane made a grim discovery - a 
centuries-old collection of bones tangled in the roots.

It has now been revealed that the remains - found in New Haven, Connecticut - are those of two people.

Discovery: Police believe the bones are hundreds of years old and that the remains of up to 5,000 people are buried in the surrounding area

The facial bones of the pair 
were found along with a 
hand-wrought coffin nail that dated back to the 18th century, according to the New Haven Independent.

On Tuesday afternoon, local woman Katie Carbo was looking at the upturned tree and was stunned to find a skull with its mouth hanging open. When she called police, they said it had likely been there since colonial times.

New Haven Police spokesman David Hartman told the New Haven Independent the tree was planted on Upper Green in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln's birth.

He said the remains likely belong to one of thousands of people buried in the area. The remains will be evaluated by the state medical examiner.

A stone marker at the foot of the tree identifies it as the 'Lincoln Oak', planted in 1909 to mark the 100th anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln's birth

The remains of an estimated 5,000 people are buried under the green.

Katie Carbo said: 'I noticed what I 
thought was a rock at first, I kind of poked it and a piece came off in 
my hand, and I noticed it was bone fragments.'

Investigators currently working to identify the sex, age and cause of death of the two bodies said there are likely to be more.

The
nail suggested the bodies were buried some time in the late 1700s, 
investigators said. The park was a cemetery until 1821.
