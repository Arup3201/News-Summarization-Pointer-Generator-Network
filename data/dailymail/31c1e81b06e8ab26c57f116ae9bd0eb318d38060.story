Arsene Wenger believes Thierry Henry deserves to be honoured by Arsenal beyond the statute depicting him outside the Emirates. 

The Gunners boss enjoyed Henry in full flight and at his best after landing him from Juventus. 

The France striker is Arsenal's greatest ever goalscorer and announced his retirement from football earlier this week.

Thierry Henry became such a legend in north London that he earned his own statue at the Emirates Stadium

And, given the impact Henry had in north London, Wenger is adamant the club will mark the end of his career fittingly.

'We will organise something in his honour and I hope the France team will also give him the recognition that he deserves,' Wenger told L'Equipe. 

'We cannot just end it like this. He deserves a proper tribute. It is very important.'

Henry had his moments, sometimes difficult to manage, but Wenger only found kind words for the 37-year-old.  

'Thierry is blessed with a strong personality and he could get angry. But once he had refound his calm, he was always very clear headed,' he added. 

'As well as his extraordinary passion for football, he always showed an incredible insight in his judgement of players. He has a real ability to unearth talent.'
