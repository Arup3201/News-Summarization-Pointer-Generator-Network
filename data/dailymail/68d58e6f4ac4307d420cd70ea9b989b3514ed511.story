Osama bin Laden's son-in-law is being held in a super-secret 'terror wing' of a fortress-like federal prison that has housed some of the most notorious criminals of recent memory.

Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, who pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of conspiring to kill Americans on 9/11, is in a cell that's eight feet by 12 feet inside the Metropolitan Correctional Center.

He's locked up just blocks from the former site of the World Trade Center where nearly 3,000 people were killed on 9/11.

The grim MCC is a mini Guantanamo Bay 
where prisoners are locked up for 22 hours a day. Hook-handed preacher of hate Abu 
Hamza, who was deported from Britain to face terrorism charges in the 
same court, is also in the same jail on the Terror Wing reserved for 
high risk inmates.

The prison is considered one of the 
harshest in the nation and Lawyers for ‘Lord of War’ arms trader Viktor Bout, who spent 14 months there in solitary, said it was so vile that it was like the jail depicted in the Alexandre Dumas novel The Count of Monte Cristo.

Rooms are said to be filthy and anyone who participates in group exercise sessions on the roof is subjected to an invasive search afterwards to make sure they do not have anything that harms them or others.

Prison guards are also known to pound on the doors at 2am and 5am and shine their flashlights in to make sure prisoners are still there.

Lockdown is at 10:45pm every night, although that can be extended to 2am on weekends with the special permission of the governor or warden.

Wake up call is at 6am and breakfast is served 30 minutes later.

Among those who have been held at the MCC include mafia crime boss John Gotti, disgraced financier Bernie Madoff, failed Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad and 1993 World Trade Centre bomber Ramzi Yousef.

Ghaith entered his plea Friday through a lawyer during a brief court appearance. 

Bin Laden's  son-in-law will be prosecuted by the same team that indicted the Al Qaeda leader and terror mastermind.

Ghaith, who did the mob equivalent of marrying the boss' daughter, spoke only to confirm he understood what has happening during the 17-minute hearing.

The 47-year-old wore a standard issue navy blue prison top and trousers and looked despondent, staring intently at his translator throughout.

FBI Assistant Director in Charge George Venizelos has called him the terror equivalent of a 'consigliere in a mob family.'

He denied being what the U.S media have called the 'loudmouth son-in-law' to bin Laden, whose eldest daughter Fatima he married.

According to a six-page indictment, Abu Ghaith is said to have conspired to kill Americans and boasted of the 9/11 attacks, which he also may have helped to plan.

Ghaith only spoke in single-word answers as he entered his not guilty plea during the 17-minute hearing in federal court

The day after the terror attacks, he appeared in a video in which he urged 'the nation of Islam' to wage war on 'the Jews, the Christians and the Americans.'

He later warned in another video that 'the storms shall not stop, especially the airplane storm' and told  Americans 'not to board any aircraft and not to live in high rises.'

Abu Ghaith is the most senior figure from Al Qaeda to face justice in a US court since it began its war on terrorism after the September 11 attacks, which killed 2,995 people.

His prosecution in New York is a mark of how determined America was to get him – the FBI agents and District Attorneys who indicted bin Laden 15 years ago are based there and have been asked to assist on his case.

At Manhattan's Federal Court Friday, which is a few blocks from Ground Zero, Judge Lewis Kaplan denied Abu Ghaith bail and said that the next hearing will take place on April 8.

Abu Ghaith, a former preacher, was arrested in Ankara, Turkey on February 28.

According to the New York Times, the Turkish authorities refused to extradite him to the US so he was deported to his native Kuwait.

On a stopover in Jordan he was supposedly picked up by CIA agents and flown to New York where he arrived on March 1.

The case marks a legal victory for the Obama administration, which has long sought to charge senior Al Qaeda suspects in civilian courts instead of holding them in Guantanamo Bay - but Republicans say they should remain there.

Ghaith was arrested in a dramatic take-down by CIA officials in Jordan several days ago, and is now being held in a detention facility in lower Manhattan.

In 2001, Abu Ghaith is said to have 
been imprisoned alongside al-Qaeda’s military director Saif al-Adel and 
bin Laden's son Saad, after the leader sent them to Iran in the 
hopes that they would be seen as ‘an enemy of my enemy,’ a U.S. official
 said.

Although the U.S. would not confirm 
the conditions of their confinement, Iranian officials told NBC News the
 al-Qaeda leaders had been captured shortly after their arrival in the 
country in 2001 and had spent time ‘in jail.'

Court papers state that before the 9/11 attacks, bin Laden 'summoned' Ghait to his side and asked for his assistance.

Ghaith then warned the U.S. and its allies that 'a great army is gathering against you' and after the terror attacks 'the storms shall not stop, especially the Airplanes Storm.'

Ghaith will be the most senior al-Qaeda member and closest bin Laden associate to face a trial in New York.

Others, including 'mastermind' Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, are being tried by a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Attorney General Holder said in a statement: 'No amount of distance or time will weaken our resolve to bring America's enemies to justice.

'To violent extremists who threaten the American people and seek to undermine our way of life, this arrest sends an unmistakable message:

'There is no corner of the world where you can escape from justice because we will do everything in our power to hold you accountable to the fullest extent of the law.'

Records compiled by a United Nations 
sanctions committee show that Abu Ghaith was born in Kuwait in 1965, but
 that he left Kuwait for Pakistan in June 2001.

He then married one of bin Laden's daughters, Fatima.

'Ghaith  held a key position in al-Qaeda, comparable to the consigliere in a mob family or propaganda minister in a totalitarian regime,' said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Venizelo.

After the September 11 attacks, Ghaith first surfaced as one of al-Qaeda's main spokesmen.

Later,
 U.S. officials believe he was part of a group of top figures in the 
group that included one of bin Laden's sons, Saad, who allegedly 
traveled to Iran, where the Iranian government claimed they were 'in 
custody.'

The Long War 
Journal, a counterterrorism blog published by the conservative 
Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, reported in 2010 that Abu 
Ghaith had been released by Iranian authorities and supposedly had 
returned to Afghanistan.

Rep. Peter King (R-NY) announced Ghaith's arrest on Thursday, hailing it as a 'very significant victory' in the ongoing fight against al-Qaeda.

King, the former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said the CIA and FBI had caught Ghaith within the last week.

He said the arrest was confirmed by U.S. law enforcement officials.

Ghaith had allegedly taken part in the September 11 plot against the World Trade Center and Pentagon.

Wanted: Ghaith had been considered 'stateless' since since he lost his Kuwaiti citizenship after videos emerged showing him praising the September 11 attacks

'Definitely, one by one, we are getting the top echelons of al-Qaeda,' King said on Thursday.

'I give the (Obama) administration credit for this: it's steady and it's unrelenting and it's very successful.'

A terrorism analyst called  Ghaith a 'big fish' who represents the 'core of al-Qaeda.'

'Ghaith is one of ten guys left that have the financial ties and reputation who might have been able to get the old band back together to execute spectacular international terror attacks,' Dr. Thomas Lynch at the National Defense University told ABC News.

Turkish newspaper Hürriyet reported that Ghaith was passing through Jordan, on his way to Kuwait from Turkey when he was apprehended.

Terror: After the September 11 attacks, Abu Ghaith first surfaced as one of al-Qaeda's main spokesmen

The newspaper said that Ghaith was initially taken into custody more than a month ago at a luxury hotel in the Turkish capital Ankara.

Turkish officials decided he had not committed any crime in Turkey and released him the newspaper reported.

A Turkish court reportedly ruled that 
Abu Ghaith entered the country illegally from Iran on a fake passport 
and was ordered to be deported.

As a result of that ruling, Abu Ghaith 
was seized in Jordan by CIA agents while en route to Kuwait.

Ghaith
 had been considered 'stateless' since since he lost his Kuwaiti 
citizenship after videos emerged showing him praising the September 11 
attacks.

However, Turkish officials refused to confirm Ghaith's deportation or his capture in Jordan to The Associated Press.

In Amman, the Jordanian capital, a security official said he had no information on the CIA arrest.

U.S. intelligence officials in Washington did not immediately respond to request for information about Ghaith either.

'I trust he received a vigorous interrogation, and will face swift and certain justice,' King added.
