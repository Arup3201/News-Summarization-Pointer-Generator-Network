You might think mobiles and computers are taking over our lives for the worse.

But scientists have revealed our addiction to gadgetry has made us all into touch typists.

In experiments, the average person could type 72 words a minute, hitting six keys a second with an accuracy rate of 94 per cent.

This is despite the fact that we don't know where the keys are, suggesting that we're able to perform complicated tasks even when we don't know what we're doing.

21st century life: A team of cognitive psychologists from Vanderbilt and Kobe Universities in the US and Japan found the average person to have the skills associated with touch typists

A team of cognitive psychologists 
from Vanderbilt and Kobe Universities were studying automatism, the 
ability to perform actions without conscious thought or intention, when they made their discovery.

The research, published in the journal 
Attention, Perception & Psychophysics, found that skilled typists 
can't identify the positions of many of the keys on the QWERTY keyboard while novice typists don't appear to learn key locations in the first
 place.

Lead author of the study, Vanderbilt 
University's Dr Kristy Snyder, said: "When you are typing away at your 
computer, you don't know what your fingers do.

"This demonstrates that we're capable of doing extremely complicated things without knowing explicitly what we are doing."

One hundred students and locals completed the short typing test.

Then, they were shown a blank QWERTY keyboard and given 80 seconds to write the letters in the correct location.

On average, they typed 72 words per minute with 94 percent accuracy.

But they could accurately place an average of only 15 letters on a blank keyboard.

But the study also found the average person was only able to identify an average of 15 keys on a blank keyboard, suggesting we're capable of doing complicated tasks without knowing what we're doing

For more than a century, scientists have recognised the existence of automatic behaviours of this type such as tying shoelaces to making coffee to factory assembly-line work to riding a bicycle and driving a car.

Scientists had assumed that typing also fell into this category, but had not tested it.

What surprised them was evidence that conflicts with the basic theory of automatic learning which holds that it starts out as a conscious process and gradually becomes unconscious with repetition.

According to the widely held theory, as you repeat the task, it becomes increasingly automatic.

The QWERTY keyboard was invented by  Christopher Sholes, a Milwaukee port official, senator, and newspaper editor.

The first attempt by Sholes was alphabetical, but soon hit a snag -  the typebars clashed because of the key arrangements.

He rearranged the proximity of the most used letters to arrange them in a way to make the machine work.

Frequency
 and combinations of letters had to be considered to prevent key clashes
 - in essence he rejigged the letters on the machine in order to keep 
speeds down.

In 1873, QWERTY was taken on by Remington, which then manufactured typewriters.

It soon became adopted as the basis not only for English but the majority of European languages as well.

This allows you to think about other things while you performing the task but your conscious recollection of the details gradually fades away.

But the researchers were surprised when they found evidence that the typists never appear to memorise the key positions, not even when they are first learning to type.

Evidence for this conclusion came from another experiment included in the study.

The researchers recruited 24 typists who were skilled on the QWERTY keyboard and had them learn to type on a Dvorak keyboard, which places keys in different locations.

After the participants developed a reasonable proficiency with the alternative keyboard, they were asked to identify the placement of the keys on a blank Dvorak keyboard.

On average, they could locate only 17 letters correctly, comparable to participants' performance with the QWERTY keyboard.

Centennial Professor of Psychology at Vanderbilt Gordon Logan, who supervised the experiments said: 'It appears that not only don't we know much about what we are doing but we can't know it because we don't consciously learn how to do it in the first place.

'When I was a boy, you learned to type by taking a typing class and one of the first assignments was to memorise the keyboard.

'The lack of explicit knowledge of the keyboard may be due to the fact that computers and keyboards have become so ubiquitous that students learn how to use them in an informal, trial-and-error fashion when they are very young.'
