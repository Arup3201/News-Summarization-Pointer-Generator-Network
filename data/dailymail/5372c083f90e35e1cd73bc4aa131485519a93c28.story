A £25million visitor attraction celebrating the life of famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes is set to be built.

Ambitious plans for the ‘world-class multimedia experience’ are being put in place in Portsmouth, Hants.

It will combine reenactments of plots and Sherlock’s life in Baker Street, London, with holograms of different characters.

A Sherlock theme park is being planned for Portsmouth, which will include live reenactments of scenes from the books as well as holograms of the characters

The centre would use resources from the city’s Arthur Conan Doyle collection, the largest of its kind in the world.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle penned the famous detective stories after moving to Portsmouth in 1882.

Steve Pitt, of the Portsmouth Cultural Partnership which came up with the idea, said: 'What we are talking about is a world class, Sherlock Holmes experience.

'It would be very interactive and high quality. There are so many tie-ins around the legacy of Sherlock Holmes being ‘born’ in Portsmouth.

'That’s something that when we look at it, has the potential to create a massive amount of jobs.

'There are 6.9 million people who search for Sherlock Homes and Conan Doyle on Google every month. There is a massive market for this.’

Lasting appeal: Experts hope the park will preserve Sherlock. The character has already survived 100 years and many adaptations, such as the 1984 series starring Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwick

Dr Christopher Pittard, a senior lecturer in English Literature at the University of Portsmouth, welcomed the plans.

Dr Pittard, who specialises in the tales of Sherlock Holmes, said the modern screen adaptations on the detective have helped maintain an interest in the character which has already lasted over 100 years.

Dr Pittard said: 'I’m a huge fan of Conan Doyle’s work and he has been incredibly influential on the development of crime fiction.

'This would be a great idea because this is where he created Sherlock Holmes. It’s a natural place to have it.'

The idea is expected to go to a private consultation next month.
