He wants his just desserts: Alex Snelson is suing because his diet dows not allow him to eat processed foods he is being forced to eat, but does allow ice cream

A Satanic inmate has filed a federal lawsuit accusing his Nevada jailers of violating his constitutional rights by denying him meals adhering to his strict pagan diet.

Alex C. Snelson, 33, argues in the lawsuit that denying him meals without byproducts and processing additives force him to either starve or go against his religion. He lists ice cream as being one of those foods.

Snelson made the accusations in a hand-written complaint filed to the U.S. District Court in Reno, and insisted ice cream is one of the 'whole foods' his religion permits him to eat.

He claims deputies retaliated against him by refusing him ice cream because they said it would violate his religion.

'Each day that I am effectively forced to eat outside my religious dietary guidelines is a day that I must endure feeling totally and utterly violated, tortured and religiously defiled,' Snelson wrote.

The devil horn tattooed criminal was homeless and unemployed when he was arrested in 2013. He is serving two to six years in state 
prison for possession of a stolen car after spending time in the Washoe 
County Jail in Reno for possession of methamphetamine and brass 
knuckles.

He said the violation of his First Amendment rights caused him to suffer at the county jail. He's seeking 'hedonic' and 'vindictive' damages as well as monetary and punitive damages.

County prosecutors said Friday they hadn't seen the new filing and had no comment.

County spokesman Bob Harmon said it is the policy of the jail operated by the sheriff's office to 'accommodate the religious practices of all inmates.'

Mr. Snelson's allegations are just that â€” allegations, and we are confident that the facts will show that the Washoe County Sheriff's Office acted in accordance with constitutional requirements,# Harmon said Friday.

The filing: The lawsuit was filed with a handwritten compliant explaining how Snelson feels his rights have been violated

Washoe County Deputy District Attorney Mary Kandaras said in court filings in March that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has held previously that such claims must be 'rooted in religious belief' not in 'purely secular' philosophical concerns.

'Determining if a prisoner's claim is 'rooted in religious belief' requires analyzing whether the prisoner's claim is related to his sincerely held religion's belief,' she said in a motion requesting that Snelson be required to explain his beliefs.

Kandaras said Snelson's original lawsuit filed in August didn't identify any specific religion, the content of his diet, whether his diet was recognized by the tenets of his religion or if he simply made it up.

Snelson, who is acting as his own attorney, said in the amended suit he is a full, active and participating member of the pagan religion Satanism.

'I use my diet to purify and cleanse my internal organs,' he said, adding that the 'religious dietary restrictions that have been imposed on me by my church and by my religion and by my faith.'

Where it happened: The Nevada State Prison, outside Reno, is where Snelson is being held

Snelson said he is a member of the Church of Light in Chino Hills, California.

There is no readily available record of such a church existing

A leader of a leading international Satanic organization also questioned Snelson's claims.

The Church of Satan, founded in San Francisco in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey, allows its members 'to choose whatever diet is pleasing to them,' said Magus Peter H. Gilmore, a high priest at the church.

The church website says it is the 'original Church of Satan' dedicated to the 'acceptance of man's nature as an animal living in a cosmos that is indifferent to his existence.' It adds that Satanism is 'not Devil worship. There is no belief in God, Satan, the soul, the supernatural or in any form of afterlife.'

Devotees are permitted to enjoy ice cream.
