A Japanese hostage held by Islamic State revealed that his fellow captive has been beheaded in a gruesome video released by the terror group on Saturday.

In the film, Kenji Goto Jogo was shown holding a picture of Haruna Yukawa’s decapitated body.

Mr Goto, 47, a freelance journalist, then delivered a message in English in which he blames Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, for Mr Yukawa’s death and pleads to his wife, Rinko: ‘Don’t let Abe do the same for my case.’

This still image apparently showing Japanese prisoner Kenji Goto holding a picture of fellow captive Haruna Yukawa's body appeared alongside the recording, but some have said it looks photoshopped

The video emerged a day after a deadline passed for Japan’s government to buy the two hostages’ release. 

On Tuesday, Islamic State (IS) posted a video in which the masked British executioner known as Jihadi John demanded £134 million within 72 hours to free the two men.

In the video, the group said it no longer wanted the ransom, but demanded the release of an Al Qaeda prisoner Sajida Al-Rishawi, on Death Row in the Jordanian capital, Amman.

Al-Rishawi, 44, took part in co-ordinated suicide attacks on three hotels in Amman in 2005 which killed 60. 

Her suicide vest failed to detonate and she was later found guilty of terrorism and sentenced to death.

Mr Goto said in the video the new demand was easier to meet as the Japanese delegation sent to Amman to secure his release could put pressure the Jordanian government to release Al-Rishawi.

In his emotional message, Mr Goto said: ‘Rinko, my beloved wife, I love you, and I miss my two daughters. Please don’t let Abe do the same for my case. Don’t give up. You, along with our family, friends and my colleagues in the independent press must continue to pressure our government.’

In a section almost certainly scripted by IS, he added: ‘Abe, you killed Haruna, you did not take the threat of my captors seriously and you did not act within 72 hours.’

Mr Goto finished his message by saying: ‘Rinko, these could be my last hours in this world and I may be a dead man speaking, don’t let these be my last words you ever hear. Don’t let Abe also kill me.’

The video has still to be verified but Shiraz Maher, terrorism expert at London’s International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, said: ‘It probably is genuine.’

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘If confirmed, the brutal murder of Haruna Yukawa is a barbaric and despicable act.’
