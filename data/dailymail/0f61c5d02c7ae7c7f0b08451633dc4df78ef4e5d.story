A former Vassar student has sued the college after being expelled over what he says are false rape claims.

Xiaolu 'Peter' Yu says he lost his virginity to Mary Claire Walker in February last year after a party, but she later accused him of rape and the school expelled him.

Yu, a student from China, says he and Walker, both on the college's rowing teams, went back to his dorm room after a rowing club party on February 18, 2012, where they had consensual sex.

According to the New York Post, papers filed by Yu in a Manhattan federal court yesterday say that he was expelled on Walker’s 'flimsy say-so', alleging that male students at the
 formerly all-female college in Poughkeepsie are 'invariably found 
guilty' when female students accuse them of sexual misconduct.

The documents say that Yu and Walker, who is the daughter of a Vassar geology professor, engaged in 'clearly consensual sexual activity' in Yu's Vassar dorm room, and that Walker even sent Yu a message on Facebook the next day, telling him she 'had a wonderful time.'

It's not known why Walker, who is due to graduate in 2014, accused Yu of rape a year after the alleged event, but the school's action was swift.

Vassar's regulations state that 'Any student accused of rape will automatically and concurrently be charged with attempted rape, sexual assault, and attempted sexual assault. The minimum sanction for any student found guilty of rape will be immediate expulsion from the college.'

Yu says the night he lost his 
virginity, Walker was a willing participant. Before the pair arrived at 
Yu's dorm, Walker had called her own roommate to see if they could 
spend the night in her dorm room.

In 
Yu's dorm room, he told Walker it was his first time, and she told him 
not to worry: 'It's OK, I know what to do,' the New York Post reports 
Walker responded, before engaging in oral sex with Yu.

Walker later put a condom on Yu and they had sex until his roommate came home, after which Walker 'began to lament about her 
ex-boyfriend and stated that she was not ready to jump into anything 
new' with Yu.

The 
documents filed with the Manhattan federal court state Walker then got 
dressed and left after noting that she 'took Peter Yu’s 
virginity,' reports the paper.

Yu is seeking unspecified damages on 
grounds including gender discrimination, breach of contract and 
intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The court documents say Yu later learned that two women also on the rowing team, one of whom was his 'former romantic interest', had tried to contact campus security when they saw Yu walking home with Walker, 'who appeared to be drunk.'

It's not clear what evidence was provided to Vassar to support Walker's claims, but Max Fraad-Wolf, who went through a similar experience to Yu in 1994, told The New York Times that he wasn't allowed to present evidence in his case and that he was not permitted a lawyer.

A spokesman for Vassar, Jeff Kosmacher, told the New York Post that 'all student-conduct matters at Vassar are confidential.'

'Our student-conduct policies and procedures are closely reviewed by our attorneys, so they have strong legal grounding, and they’re also designed to consider the rights of all parties in matters like these,' he said.

Xiaolu Yu was a candidate in the Vassar 2011 student elections, and told his fellow students: 'We are all here ready to explore a new life as college students and I am ready to help people to bring their voice to the college... Vote for me, and we will work in a group to making a tremendously positive difference to our home.'
