Everyone has a cheeky grin when they find a crumpled up fiver wedged in the sofa but just imagine the utter thrill of stumbling upon a cash machine that dispenses free cash.

That's what a large number of lucky people experienced in Tooting High Street on Wednesday when a cash machine mysteriously started giving out £10,000 in notes.

The unsuspecting customers were not asked for a PIN number and no details were taken from their cards but, apart from that, the on-screen process was identical to genuine ATM.

Super rich? Hugo Ellis and his girlfriend Celeste Powell scooped £500 by using the Betfair machine

A video of the money transactions from the ATM - known as the super rich cash machine - shows the hilarious reactions, surprise and elation as multitudes of people withdraw free money.

One man shrieks in delight and says, 'This is giving out money,' while another man cannot believe his eyes as he stares at a crisp £50 note which he has just received for free.

One beaming woman tries to persuade a disbelieving passer-by what is happening and says: 'Trust me, I just done it and I got £80.'

Two men hug as they celebrate their extra cash while another man grabs his cash adoringly and kisses the screen in gratitude. 

Hugo Ellis and his girlfriend Celeste Powell, students at Goldsmiths University who have just moved to London from Devon, were handed £500 by the machine.

Hugo said: 'We were just in MacDonald’s having a cup of tea, and then on the walk home we stopped at the Super Rich ATM machine to get some cash.

'I put my card in and took out £40, we were about to leave when the machine beeped again and more money came out! I put the money straight in my pocket and waited until we got home to count it, that was when we realised it was £500!

'We’ve just moved to London as students and we definitely weren’t expecting anything like this to happen, my girlfriend nearly cried!’

News of the generous cash machine spread on social media and long queues of people started forming outside the Super Rich cash machine as people looked to get in on the free cash.

Twitter user Kate Lennon tweeted: 'Cash machine giving out free cash in  #tooting! " #getherenow #ABBA Money money money!'

Betfair confirmed they set up the  machine to promote its Price Rush product, where a Sportsbook bet is boosted to a better price on the exchange.

Andy Holmes, Betfair Brand Product Manager, said: 'The odds on getting more money than you expected at a cash machine are pretty slim but yesterday our Super Rich Cash Machines Price Rushed transactions, gave some users much more money than they requested.

'For anyone visiting the Super Rich Cash Machines Tooting branch today, they may be in for the same experience.'
