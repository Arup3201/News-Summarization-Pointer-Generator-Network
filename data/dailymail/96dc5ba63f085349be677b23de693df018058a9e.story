Sophie Hemming savoured a memorable career highlight four years ago, despite the painful conclusion, but the England prop hopes it will be surpassed over the coming days.

It was across the road from the country’s rugby HQ that the Bristol tighthead and her team-mates strove to break Kiwi dominance of the women’s World Cup, only to fall agonisingly short in the final with a 13-10 defeat.

Now, with New Zealand dramatically out of the running, Gary Street’s side lock horns with Ireland in Paris on Wednesday evening and are aiming to reach their fourth consecutive tournament final.

On Tuesday, after being named in a line-up featuring six starting changes, Hemming, 34, recalled the encounter against the Black Ferns which England hope to trump by winning Wednesday’s semi-final and claiming their coveted prize at a sold-out Stade Jean Bouin on Sunday. ‘I will always remember the 2010 World Cup final against New Zealand,’ she said.

‘I can picture standing there at The Stoop, feeling an incredible bond with my team-mates and the supporters in the crowd. We faced the Haka and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end because the whole stadium erupted into a chant of Swing Low.

‘It was just a great experience to be with my team-mates that day, trying to achieve something special. The result didn’t go the way we wanted, but we’re in this environment again and hopefully we are ready to do something special this time around.’

The World Cup has attracted record TV viewing figures and big crowds and, asked if the England side have sensed heightened interest, Hemming said: ‘Absolutely. Having the World Cup in London in 2010 really put the foundations in place and grabbed people’s attention. The 2012 Olympics was great for showcasing women’s sport and we are riding the wave I guess.

‘We are here to bring the trophy home, but if we can do some good for women’s rugby in France, in the UK and around the world, raising the profile and showing what a brilliant sport it is, that would be brilliant.’

Tough test: England can reach the final of the Women's Rugby World Cup if they beat Ireland on Wednesday

A major catalyst for the enhanced interest in the women’s game was Ireland’s feat in condemning New Zealand to a shock pool-stage defeat which ultimately knocked them out of the World Cup. England will be wary of fired-up, familiar foes who beat them last year.

‘We know Ireland quite well and they know us quite well,’ said Hemming. ‘I play at Bristol with Claire Molloy, their No 7, and Larissa Muldoon, who is a scrum-half. A couple of years ago, I also played club rugby with their hooker, Gill Bourke.

‘Ireland came out firing against New Zealand and were massively up for it. They had never played them before and rose to the occasion. They mustn’t be underestimated — we know how strong they can be after they beat us in the Six Nations in 2013.

‘They have a very good kicking game so we have to keep our discipline and we know they have a strong driving lineout so we’ve been doing work to counter that. They are a passionate team who will have a lot of strength in the pack. We will have to be at our best to win.’
