A bomb squad was forced to blow up a wartime explosive in a field after discovering a cache of guns, ammunition and grenades in a man's garage this morning. 

Army experts were called to the semi-detached house in St Albans, Hertfordshire, this evening after police sealed off the property having discovered the hoard of historic weaponry. 

A planned explosion was carried out in a nearby field as a 48-year-old man, named locally as Alan Tissington, was arrested on suspicion of stealing from a prisoner of war camp in the UK. 

Bomb disposal robots were sent into the home this morning where police found a vast collection of war memorabilia including guns, artillery shells, mortar bombs, gas masks and uniforms from the First and Second World Wars.

Police who raided a house in a Hertfordshire street found a cache of firearms and ammunition in the garage

After the raid, police laid out some of the firearms and ammunition they had found at the man's house

Arranged against the far wall of the garage housing the memorabilia was a collection of artillery shells

Army experts carried out a controlled explosion in a field near the house this afternoon in St Albans 

Hertfordshire Police confirmed a number of detonations were carried out this afternoon in the field 

Forensics experts worked to catalogue the munitions they found, which included bullets and rifles

A garage behind the property stored a treasure trove of memorabilia - and munitions - from the world wars

A man, 46, was arrested on suspicion of theft of explosives before bomb disposal robots went into his house

Police and army officers were accompanied by experts from English Heritage as they searched the house, outbuildings and garden. 

Hertfordshire Police, who insisted the raid was not terrorism-related, said it may be necessary to remain at the house for up to 48 hours as they carry out work to establish the safety of the devices found today. 

Chief Inspector Ken Townsend, of Hertfordshire Police, said: 'This seizure is on an unprecedented scale and it will be a long process. 

'It is an extremely large collection. Although the items seized today are potentially dangerous, there is no danger to members of the public. 

'We have all the necessary experts in place to deal safely with the items recovered. The EOD will be carrying out controlled detonations this afternoon. 

'This will be heard in the local area, residents need not be alarmed.'

Officers suspect the man of illegally metal detecting on sites of historic importance, including a former Second World War PoW camp in Batford, near Harpenden.

It is a criminal offence to retrieve artefacts from the ground after finding them with a metal detector if the land is a protected site or without permission of the landowner. 

The large camp was home to around 600 prisoners of war, most of them Italian or German, until around 1947.

Hertfordshire Police said they had intelligence to suggest that the man living at the property with his family had been building up a collection of WW1 and WW2 artefacts. 

Officers believe the man, who neighbours described as a military enthusiast, had travelled to sites all over Britain and Europe in the search for memorabilia.  

Hand grenades, shell covers, incendiary bombs, and stick grenades were among the munitions discovered

Dozens of police officers, accompanied by army bomb disposal experts and sniffer dogs filled the street 

The garage contained a vast collection of memorabilia including uniforms, gas masks, helmets and wreaths

The firearms were found in a garage to the side of the semi-detached house after today's early morning raid

This Vicker's belt-fed machine gun was among the items seized by police at the house in St Albans today

Explosives found in the raid on the house today were removed by bomb disposal experts to a nearby field

Houses either side of the property were evacuated and residents at two properties behind the man's house were also told they must leave.

A police spokeswoman said 'We have found munitions, which are bombs, firearms and ammunition, and the army is here now establishing the safety of everything.

'If it is found to be safe, it will be put in the van and got rid of.'

This afternoon a neighbour, 86-year-old Doug Harris, said: 'They are a lovely family and they have helped me in the past.

'I know the family are in shock.' 

Meanwhile officers opened a community centre on the nearby Jersey Farm Estate for residents moved from their homes.

Neighbour Ranjit Yogendra, 66, said the man lived at the house with his wife and two young daughters.

After a man was arrested, bomb disposal robots from the Royal Logistics Corps went into the property

Members of the army's bomb disposal team surrounded the property which was raided at around 8am today

He said 'They must have been here around ten years. They are a lovely family.

Mother of two Maha Ibrahum, 44, said she found her home sealed off behind the police cordon when she returned home from the school run at 9.30am.

'I'm shocked because it's a nice, quiet area,' she said.  

June Reid,50, said she drew her curtains open this morning to see the street swarming with army and police officers.

She said: 'It is normally really quiet around here but when I saw soldiers, my immediate thought was it was a bomb.' 

Hertfordshire Police handed out information leaflets to neighbours and warned them that they should prepare to be evacuated at any time if explosives were discovered in the property.
