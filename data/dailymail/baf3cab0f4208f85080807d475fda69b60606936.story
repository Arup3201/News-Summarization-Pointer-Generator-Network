Paratrooper Ben Parkinson of Doncaster in south Yorkshire was offered only £570,000 after he was injured on the Afghan frontline

A Royal Navy sailor has been paid £1million after injuring her back playing a drunken game during an Armed Forces function.

The 25-year-old – who is still serving – was hurt plunging from the top of a human pyramid built by alcohol-fuelled troops as they larked about in the mess.

In stark contrast, the compensation is double the amount paid to Ben  Parkinson, the most seriously hurt British soldier to survive the Afghan frontline.

Then aged 23, the paratrooper was blown up by a mine in 2006. He was left in a coma for months with 37  injuries, including losing both legs,  damage to his spine, skull, pelvis, hands, spleen and ribcage.

Initially the Lance Bombardier was offered just £152,000 plus a £19,000-a-year pension. After a battle by his mother Diane Dernie and public outrage, the hero was awarded £570,000.

This is now the maximum payout a soldier can receive for battlefield  injuries from the Ministry of Defence.

The sailor’s injuries were described as ‘very serious’. Although she is not understood to have been paralysed, it is believed she has problems with mobility.

The deal is certain to undermine morale within Britain’s beleaguered Armed Forces.

It comes as the MoD pushes through severe cuts to save  £4.7billion and plug a £38billion hole in the equipment programme.

Last night her payout after a six-year legal battle was condemned by Major Charles Heyman, a senior defence analyst and editor of Armed Forces of the UK.

He said: ‘It seems utter madness to use such an enormous amount of  taxpayers’ money when there appears to be at least some negligence on the part of the person concerned.

‘If somebody sustains life-changing injuries on the battlefield, then everyone understands why they should receive compensation. But to foot a £1million bill for a drunken accident is nothing short of scandalous.

‘It is even more disgraceful that this can happen at a time when the MoD is facing such severe financial restraints.

‘Someone high up needs to answer some very searching questions.’

Shadow Armed Forces Minister Kevan Jones said: ‘It’s right that when our Armed Forces are injured on duty, they are compensated and, if required, looked after.

‘But this seems a very large sum given the financial constraints the MoD is under and [Defence Secretary] Philip Hammond should explain why.’

Shaun Rusling, vice-chairman of the National Gulf  Veterans and Families Association, said ministers had only spent £6million investigating ill-health which affected 7,500 troops who fought in the 1991 conflict.

He said: ‘It is absolutely outrageous that veterans who became ill serving their country are neglected for medical equipment and treatment, yet the Government insists it can’t pay for more.

This case really raises questions about where their priorities lie.’

The payment to the sailor is also more than 50 times the basic £17,767 salary of a  private fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.

The unnamed woman, who is understood not to be an officer and is now 31, was attending the official event at a base on land.

During the evening in 2007, she became involved in ‘drunken high jinks’ with high-spirited troops climbing on each others’ shoulders, sources told the Mail.

But the human tower  collapsed and the servicewoman plummeted up to 30ft to the floor.

The woman took legal action, arguing that top brass had responsibility for her well-being as she was invited to the event. In 2012-13, the Armed Forces’ bill for civil cash claims topped £108.9million, up £21million on the previous financial year.

The payouts were inflated by troops claiming that negligence by top brass caused their injuries as well as cases brought by Iraqi nationals alleging abuse by British forces.

Desk staff at the MoD pocketed £18million from 724 claims for a string of bizarre accidents, including a  fractured leg from tripping over a frayed carpet.

Service personnel were behind another 2,517 payouts totalling £51.3million which did not include those injured on active duty.

MoD officials have refused to give further details about the sailor’s case but other awards have caused controversy.

Last November, it was revealed three female RAF recruits were each given £100,000 after suffering spinal and pelvic injuries caused by marching in step with taller male colleagues.

In 2007, the MoD paid £484,000 to an RAF typist who said she suffered repetitive strain injury to her thumb.

A Daily Mail campaign was prompted by anger at paltry sums for servicemen and women hurt on duty. In 2010, huge rises in awards were announced by Labour.
