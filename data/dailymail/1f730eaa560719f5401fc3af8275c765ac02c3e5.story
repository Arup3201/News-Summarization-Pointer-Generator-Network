An inspirational teenager managed to raise nearly £50, 000 for charity in the months before she passed away from a terminal brain tumour.

Hannah Brown died aged just 17 after being diagnosed with a tumour in February 2012, and being told in March this year that the cancer had spread to her spine and was  incurable.

Family and friends said she had an attitude of a 'warrior', remaining positive while enduring chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and countless operations.

She passed two GCSE's from her hospital bed, won the Prom Queen title at her school and  pledged to spend the time she had left raising money to help others in her position.

Before she died, she raised more then £46,000 for charity, despite being so ill she wasn't able to carry out any of the tasks on her bucket list - which included skydiving or going to Harry Potter world.

Hannah Brown, 17, has lost her battle with a brain tumour after being told in March her cancer had spread to her spine and was incurable. Despite her illness, she remained positive and was even crowned Prom Queen at her end of year disco

Miss Brown vowed to raise £50,000 for the Parents' Association of Children with Tumours and Leukaemia (PACT) and managed to raise £46,000 before she passed away

Now she has lost her battle with cancer, her family plan to continue fundraising over and above her £50,000 target.

Her mother Velvyn Brown, 50, from Hatfield, South Yorkshire, said: 'We are just a normal family and we never expected something like this to happen to us.

'Hannah was not like a typical teenage girl, she was perfect.

'I am so proud of how she handled everything, I am more than proud.' 

'She wasn't just my daughter she was my best friend. I can't believe she's not going to walk through the door any more.'

Mrs Brown, who works in the prison service, says her daughter was initially diagnosed with the tumour when she began to notice problems with her hearing. 

She said: 'When Hannah was six she had difficulty breathing so we took her to the doctor. She had her tonsils out and grommets fitted.

'They told us to watch out for hearing problems as she got older. When I came from work every day I noticed the TV was getting louder and louder without Hannah realising.

'They gave her a nasal spray but when that didn't improve things they did an MRI scan where they found the brain tumour.'

Despite the devastating diagnosis, the teenager stayed positive, even when she was told  her cancer was terminal in February this year.

Her family and friends said she repeated the mantra 'I'm a warrior not a worrier' and never complained.

 Her family and friends described Miss Brown (pictured left and right) as a 'warrior' as she remained positive and determined despite being ill. She managed to pass two GCSEs from her hospital bed

Before she died, Miss Brown was an avid sportswoman, playing bowls for Doncaster Belles under 16s and Pilkingtons Recreational Bowling Club

She even passed two GCSEs from her hospital bed and vowed to raise £50,000 for the charity Parents' Association of Children with Tumours and Leukaemia (PACT).

PACT was formed in 1977 as a support group for families whose children had cancer and now provides equipment to families and provides money for research into a cure for cancer

Mrs Brown said: 'She wanted people her own age to know it can happen to them and that cancer does affect teenagers.

'The community came together and gave us ideas for fundraising. We couldn't believe the level of support.

'She's touched so many hearts. We still go to awards ceremonies for her achievements now.

'Her school have been fantastic. They do a yearly award and they are changing it to Hannah's Award.'

Her family members say they will continue fundraising in her honour. Miss Brown is pictured here with them before her school Prom, where she was crowned Prom Queen

Miss Brown continued fundraising until she died despite being too ill to carry out any of the tasks on her bucket list, such as skydving or visiting Harry Potter world. She is pictured with her football team, Doncaster Belles, at a charity match

Miss Brown was an avid sportswoman, playing bowls for Doncaster Belles under 16s and Pilkingtons Recreational Bowling Club.

She even came runner up South Yorkshire Juniors Crown Green Bowls Tournament the day after her diagnosis.

Her father, David Brown, said: 'She was such an inspiration and we can't believe the way she seemed to touch everyone's life without even trying.

'Her work has inspired so many people, some of whom never knew Hannah, and we are so proud of her. 

'We are continuing to raise money for the charity - it's what Hannah would have wanted.'

Miss Brown had made a bucket list of things she wanted to do before she passed away, but  was too poorly to complete anything on the list.

She wanted to do a sky dive, ride in a hot air balloon, go to Harry Potter World and go to a Manchester United match.

Mrs Velvyn said: 'Every time we set a date for something she would get poorly again.

'Her brother Matthew is going to do the sky dive in her memory.

'Hannah never lived to see the £50k target but we are determined to make it happen.

'We will be carrying on her fundraising legacy for as long as possible.'
