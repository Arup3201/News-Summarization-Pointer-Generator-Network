A pair of Burmese migrant workers have been charged in connection with the brutal murder of two British tourists at a luxury Thai beach resort.  

David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found mutilated on Sairee beach on the after attending a party on the island of Koh Tao in September.

Autopsies showed both had suffered severe head wounds and Witheridge had been raped, before their bodies were discovered near the resort known for world-class scuba diving.

Burmese migrant workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21,  have been charged with the murders. They claim they were tortured by Thai police before they confessed to the crime. The pair were working in the country illegally 

Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, who were working in the country illegally, have now been charged by Thai prosecutors with with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery, according to deputy police chief spokesman Colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen. 

Neither man appeared at the Provincial Court on the island of Ko Samui and they will have an opportunity to enter a plea at the next hearing, he added. 

They are also entitled to request bail at any time, he said. 

Police claimed the men confessed to the killings in October, adding that the DNA evidence matched that of the two suspects. 

Prosecutors have said other evidence includes close-circuit television footage linking the two to the crime.

But there has been international concern about the way the case has been handled by the Thai authorities. 

The pair, both 21, have admitted they were drinking beer and playing guitar near the scene where Witheridge from Great Yarmouth and Miller from Jersey were found on September. 

They could be sentenced to die by lethal injection if they are convicted.

But they claim that their initial confessions were extracted by beatings and threats and it was reported that a Burmese embassy official later formally retracted their statements to police.  

Amnesty International has called for an investigation into the allegations, citing a lawyer from the Burmese embassy legal team who said he had been told that police had beaten one suspect and 'threatened him with electrocution.'

The Foreign Office has also expressed concern to Thai authorities about whether the investigation was conducted properly and British detectives also flew to the country to observe and assist the Thai investigators with the case, last month. 

Along with the torture allegations, police have also been criticised for failing to secure the crime scene and releasing several names and pictures of suspects who turned out to be innocent.

They were also condemned after they paraded Lin and Htun in front of cameras shortly after the had made their confessions. 

A lawyer for the pair also said key witnesses are too afraid to come forward, hampering his clients' defence as they prepare to enter a plea.

'This case is not fair,' Nakhon Chomphuchat, head of their Thai legal team told the AFP. 'They were migrant workers so witnesses do not dare to testify (for the defence). 

'We have many disadvantages ... we still have not seen the prosecutors' evidence, we just have to fight as best as we can,' he added.

Royal Thai Police Major General Suwat Jaengyodsuk defended the investigation before the country's Human Rights Commission yesterday, according the Bangkok Post. 

Insisting the DNA tests and arrests had been handled by the book he said there had been no torture at any time during the investigation, the paper reported. 

Witheridge, a student at the University of Essex, was described by her family as 'a beautiful, intelligent, loving young woman who poured joy into the lives of all who knew her'.

Mr Miller finished studying civil and structural engineering at Leeds University in June, where he was on course to achieve a first-class degree. His family said he was a 'hard-working, bright and conscientious' young man who would be 'sorely, sorely missed.'
