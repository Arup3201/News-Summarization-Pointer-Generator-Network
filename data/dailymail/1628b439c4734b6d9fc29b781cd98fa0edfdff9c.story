Heartbreaking images have emerged of dogs getting caught in the tear-gas fired by riot police in Turkey.

The latest photographs, which were uploaded to Twitter, are believed to show dogs caught up in the carnage near Gezi Park in Istanbul.

In one image a protester wipes a dog's eyes that are clearly red and sore.

In another a dog is pictured in a gas masks with a Turkish sign around his neck that calls for resistance in the protests.

It is not clear whether the first image is of a pet or a stray.

It comes as activists demand that tear gas be banned in the country and called for police chiefs responsible for heavy-handed tactics to resign.

A picture of academic Ceyna Sungar being doused in pepper spray has been shared across the world as used as a galvanising force for further demonstrations.

Yesterday police used tear gas and water cannons to break up a gathering in Ankara after allowing demonstrations to continue for some eight hours.

Trade unions have now joined the movement and leaders have presented the government with a list of demands they said could end the demonstrations.

In a move to defuse the tension, the deputy prime minister earlier met with a group whose attempt to prevent authorities from ripping up trees in Taksim has snowballed into the nationwide protests.

Over five days, police have deployed water cannons and tear gas has clouded the country's city centers. The Ankara-based Human Rights Association says close to 1,000 people have been injured and more than 3,300 people have been detained.

The Turkish Human Rights Association said 3,300 people nationwide were detained during the four days of protests.

At least 1,300 people were injured and a 22-year-old man died during a protest.

Turkey's state-run news agency says 
police have detained 25 people for 'spreading untrue information' on 
social media and provoking protests.

The
Anadolu Agency said today they were detained in the city of Izmir for 
allegedly 'inciting the people to enmity and hate.' It said police were 
still looking for 13 others.

Mr
Aric described the crackdown as 'wrong and unjust' but Mr Erdogan, who 
is out of the country, has previously described protestors as 'looters' 
and dismissed the protests as acts by fringe extremists.

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said they were advising British nationals to avoid all demonstrations.
