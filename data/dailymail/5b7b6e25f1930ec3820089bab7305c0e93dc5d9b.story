The Democratic Republic of Congo fought back from two goals down against their neighbours the Republic of Congo, to win a dramatic quarter-final 4-2.

Joel Kimuaki’s header eight minutes from time rounded off an astonishing comeback before Dieumerci Mbokani made the win certain late on in a game which saw six goals, and the woodwork struck twice, in a pulsating 36-minute spell.

After a dreadful first half, in which chances had been limited to hopeful long range efforts and a couple of scuffed shots, the Congo derby ignited after the break.

There were signs of life from the first seconds of the second half, when Jeremy Bokila had a shout for a penalty turned down, and soon after the striker rattled the crossbar following an excellent knock-down from Dieumerci Mbokani.

But just as it looked as though DR Congo were beginning to take control of the game they fell apart. In the 54th minute Dore Ferebory was given the freedom of the penalty box from a free kick, and he stabbed home to break the deadlock.

A little more than five minutes later and Claude Le Roy’s side were two goals ahead, following some suicidal defending.

First Jean Kasusula gifted the ball to Theivy Bifouma, the tournament’s top goalscorer, then Robert Kidiaba charged out of his goal for no reason.

Bifouma fed Dore, who should have taken advantage to grab his second, but when his shot was blocked back to Bifouma, the former West Brom striker made no mistake.

In between the two goals the Leopards had come close themselves, Cedric Makiadi curling a free kick beautifully onto the cross bar.

And going a second goal behind seemed to galvanise them, Yannick Bolasie in particular finally finding his best form.

The Crystal Palace winger produced some of the magic he has been showing in the Premier League this season to bamboozle his fullback, before squaring it for Mbokani, who couldn’t miss.

Suddenly the game was back on, and DR Congo were pushing forward at every opportunity. Bokila, whose finishing had been woeful throughout should have converted a Mbokani knock-down, but fired wide of the far post.

But the chances continued to flow, and the 26-year-old eventually managed to find the target. Having seen yet another shot saved, Bokila stayed alive with the ball still in the box, eventually swiveling on it and smashing home from 15 yards.

It was a brilliant finish, and had he shown that level of quality earlier in the game DR Congo would have been out of sight.

And the comeback was completed six minutes later when substitute Kimuaki flicked a Bolasie free kick into the corner of the net.

The extreme drama could not have been more unexpected after a drab first half. The two countries may share a border, a name and plenty of political disagreement, but the expected bite was entirely lacking from the an opening 45 minutes in which neither side seemed up for the challenge.

DR Congo shaded the play, Bokila scuffing two glorious chances, but the majority of the game was played at a pedestrian pace in the midfield, with long shots the order of the day.

Only Cedrick Mabwati threatened to stir what crowd there was inside the stadium from their heat-induced slumber, the winger popping up all over the place to torment the opposition full-backs.

But on the other wing, the Leopards talisman Bolasie was strangely subdued. Aside from a man of the match performance in the first game, the Palace winger has not been able to make much of an impression on this tournament, and so it seemed to be proving again.

That was until his side really needed him at two goals down, at which point Bolasie sprung into life. His two assists changed the game, and he had a good chance to seal the win himself before Mbokani wrapped up DR Congo’s place in the semi final.

It was the Leopard’s first win of the tournament, and will be their first semi-final since 1998. On this evidence, when their backs are against the wall, you wouldn’t write them off from going further.
