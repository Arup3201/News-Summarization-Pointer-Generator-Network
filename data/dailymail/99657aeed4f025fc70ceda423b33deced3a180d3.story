A senior U.S. House Democrat unveiled this week an aggressive agenda to boost workers' paychecks by shifting significant tax breaks from the wealthiest Americans to the middle class.

The plan from Representative Chris Van Hollen has almost no chance of passage by the Republican-controlled Congress but is aimed at shaping Democrats' policy vision for the 2016 presidential election. 

The Maryland Democrat's plan calls for an annual 'paycheck bonus' tax credit of $1,000 for individuals making less than $100,000 a year and $2,000 for married couples making less than $200,000 and would be funded through a new fee on financial transactions.

Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen wants to boost workers' paychecks by shifting significant capital from the wealthiest Americans to the middle class

It also includes a bonus of $250 for people who save at least $500 of this credit every year. 

The tax breaks would be offset with a 0.1 percent tax on stock trades, mostly from high-volume transactions.

According to the Washington Post, the legislation would redirect $1.2 billion over a decade from the nation's top earners to the middle class.

Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the House's budget committee, said the tax - what he called a 'high-roller fee' - would curb 'the kind of financial speculation that creates no value for the economy.'

He portrayed his plan as an alternative to Republicans' ambitions to cut top tax rates as part of an overall rewrite of the U.S. tax code this year.

The Democratic lawmaker said the new tax would limit corporate tax deductions of bonuses paid to executives in excess of $1 million unless the companies can show their workers are getting pay raises that reflect productivity and cost-of-living changes. 

It would also give tax benefits to companies that invest in employee training programs and increase deductions for child daycare expenses from $3,000 per person to $8,000.

'We can pay for these new tax benefits for working Americans by changing the ways our current tax code is rigged in favor of those who make money off of money and against those who make money from work,' Van Hollen said. 

The plan goes beyond Democrats' past efforts to address rising income inequality, which centered on raising the minimum wage. That message found little resonance among middle-class voters in November's elections, leaving the party searching for a more effective message.

The White House wouldn't endorse Van Hollen's plan today, saying it needed to review the details, but Pelosi has offered her support. Boehner's office slammed it as a 'trillion-dollar tax hike'

Republicans say the plan is nothing more than a 'massive' tax increase, though, that would add to the dysfunction of the tax system rather than alleviate it.

Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Republican House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, told Reuters, 'Here in the House our focus is going to be on cleaning up the tax code so that we can lower rates for all taxpayers and help create good-paying jobs, not scaring them off with punitive tax hikes.'

'Our economy is still struggling to create jobs - and the last thing we need is a new trillion-dollar tax hike added to the current broken tax code,'  Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, told Fox News.

In response, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee accused Republicans of not caring about the average Americans the bill seeks to aid.

'Apparently House Republicans only like tax relief if it's for their millionaire friends and special interest backers, not for hardworking middle class families,' the DCCC said in a statement,

Van Hollen's plan has drawn the praise of his Democratic colleagues on Capitol Hill searching for new ways to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor.

'The challenge is a big one. You have to think big, you have to think forward, and you have to think new. You have to think new and fresh,' House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told the Washington Post. 

Van Hollen told the Post that he had spoke to senior Obama administration officials and they seemed supportive of his plan.

The president's spokesman would not offer an endorsement of the legislation today, however, saying the White House had not yet had an opportunity to review it in its entirety.
