The huge pile of cash handed to the European Union by the UK has soared to a whopping £53 million per day, it was revealed today.

Britain's annual contribution for being a member is now at a record £19.2 billion and the nation is getting back even less cash in return, the Office for National Statistics has revealed.

In 2010 the UK's overall bill was £18.2billion, meaning that the £1 billion increase last year is an inflation-busting five per cent rise.

This means that now every Briton is contributing £300 a year each to maintain our link with Brussels.

And after taking into account what the country gets back in subsidies for forming and regional development projects, Britain paid £8.4billion more than it received last year compared to £7.3 billion in 2010 - an increase of £1.1 billion. 

In total since 1979, Britain has paid in
about £228 billion and has received back in benefits 
just £143 billion.

After Angela Merkel's Germany, Britain is the second highest contributor of the 27 EU members.

Claims: David Cameron says he has got a good deal for Britain and maintains he doesn't want to leave the EU

UKIP leader and MEP Nigel Farage said: '19 billion here, 19 billion there, pretty soon we are talking real money. In our terms this is as much as we spend on the Home Office and Justice combined.

'That the daily figure has topped £53 million a day is astonishing and something that this Government just cannot be proud of while it attempts to rein in the scourge of public spending.

'We know the costs of Europe, the question remains, what are the benefits? Cameron refuses to sanction a proper study into this, and we know why, there is simply no justification for taking so much from the public purse to fritter elsewhere. Of course by the public purse I mean the taxpayer.'

David Cameron is facing huge pressure from the public and his own party over Britain's membership of the EU.

Just weeks ago the
Prime Minister said he wanted a ‘new settlement’ with Europe, but 
suggested this would stop short of Britain quitting the EU.

Mr
Cameron criticised Eurosceptics who want to leave, saying their vision 
for Britain would create ‘a sort of greater Switzerland... that would be
a complete denial of our national interest’.

Asked
whether he could ever envisage campaigning for Britain to leave the EU,
Mr Cameron replied: ‘I don’t think we should leave the EU.

Big spenders: Only Angela Merkel's Germany gives more to the EU than Britain

‘But
I think we should be, over time, seeking a new settlement and receiving
a new mandate for that settlement. Because I think the change taking 
place in Europe is very profound. I’m an optimist. I think this is 
perfectly possible.’

The Prime Minister has already accepted a 2.8 per cent increase in next year's EU budget but the Government maintains they are getting a good deal.

'The Government has consistently pressed for restraint in the EU budget and achieved a real-terms freeze in the 2012 budget,' A Treasury spokesman told the Express.
