Targeted: Prince Harry will be in the Taliban's sights when he returns to Afghanistan at the controls of an Apache attack helicopter

Taliban leaders have promised to use 'all their power' to kill or capture Prince Harry when he returns to Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot.

The 27-year-old is expected to fly missions out of Camp Bastion in Helmand Province on a four-month tour of duty, according to Ministry of Defence sources.

Having spent 10 weeks as an infantry officer in the war-torn country in 2008, he will go back as a co-pilot gunner on the world's most deadly attack chopper.

But even with such fearsome weaponry at his disposal, the Taliban have revealed their determination to catch him dead or alive.

Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the insurgency, said: 'In the past, we have defended against the invaders and we will do so in the future.

'We will continue to defend against all the invaders, but we will use all our power to kill or capture the Prince.'

However, he claimed that Harry would be treated like any other prisoner if caught.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Mujahid also said the third in the line to the throne should use his royal status to help not kill them.

The Prince, who qualified as a pilot after an intensive 18-month training programme, was looking forward to 'doing his duty', according to Royal sources.

No date has been announced for his deployment, which will be reviewed by senior generals and the Prime Minister before he is given the all-clear.

Earlier today, the Army Air Corps Captain chatted to comrades in the armed forces about the perils of having to remember how to use all his equipment when on tour in Afghanistan.

He also spoke to servicemen and women about the fast food joints in Camp Bastion as he shared stories with the troops based at RAF Honington in Suffolk.

Meanwhile, Pakistan has arrested two people in connection with last year's assassination of a former Afghan president who was trying to broker peace with the Taliban, two Afghan government officials said Friday.

The officials told The Associated Press that the two were detained in the Pakistani city of Quetta, the alleged base of the Taliban insurgency.

The police chief in Quetta and the spokesman for the region's paramilitary Frontier Corps said they had not heard of the alleged arrests.

Officials with Pakistan's foreign and interior ministries did not immediately answer phone calls seeking comment.

Relations with Pakistan soured after the assassination of Burhanuddin Rabbani, Afghanistan's former president and head of the government-appointed peace council.

Rabbani was killed September 20, 2011, in his home in Kabul by a suicide bomber posing as a peace emissary from the Taliban.
