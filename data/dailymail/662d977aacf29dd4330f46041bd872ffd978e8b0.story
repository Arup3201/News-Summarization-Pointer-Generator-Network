Convicted fraudster and Astor heir Anthony Marshall stunned distinguished guests at a lavish party for proposed cruise ship Titanic II on Tuesday after he turned up wearing an heirloom recovered from a relative's body on the doomed voyage and bragged about selling it for $1million.

Marshall, 88, has been outcast by New York society since he was convicted of conning his philanthropist mother Brooke Astor out of $60 million in 2009. He and wife Charlene have kept to a frugal life of solitude ever since and are rarely seen in public.

However the couple ventured out for the event this week at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in Manhattan, thrown by Australian millionaire Clive Palmer who is behind the ambitious plans to build Titanic II.

Values: The watch which Anthony Marshall is planning to sell to the highest bidder belonged to ancestor John Jacob Astor IV, a millionaire and decorated Spanish-American war hero who died in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912

Sad news: The telegram which was sent to bear the news that JJ Astor's body had been recovered on April 22, 1912 and was identified by his personal effects including a gold watch

Marshall wore the watch which he said had been give to him by his father Vincent Astor.

The gold piece had been found on the body of John Jacob Astor IV who was wearing it when he died on the Titanic after it sank on April 15, 1912.

The tycoon was the wealthiest person on board the luxury liner when it went down and the timepiece along with his gold watch, cuff links and a ring were later recovered with his body.

A source told the New York Post: 'He [Marshall] said the watch had belonged to his 
stepfather. And that it had John Jacob’s 
initials on the back, which had been used to identify the body.'

Marshall was also overheard telling guests that he planned to sell the family heirloom and hoped to fetch $1million.

His wife Charlene, 67, was seen wearing Brooke Astor's diamond and ruby bracelet, one of the few things she inherited from her mother-in-law who referred to her as 'that b****'.

The Marshalls were among 600 guests at the event to announce the ambitious project due for completion in 2016.

John Jacob Astor has become one of the most fabled characters to emerge from the 1,517 passengers who died when the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912.

The 47-year-old American tycoon, who built the Astoria Hotel in New York, was returning from his honeymoon on the doomed vessel with his 19-year-old pregnant wife Madeleine.

When the Titanic struck the iceberg, Astor helped his wife into a lifeboat but remained onboard. He was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck.

Half an hour later, the ship slipped beneath the ocean waves. His wife survived.

Astor's was one of the 333 bodies recovered on April 22 by a cable ship. He was identified by the initials sewn into his jacket along with his engraved gold watch.  

Astor's son Vincent inherited the piece and wore it for the rest of his life before passing it on to his son, Anthony.

J.J Astor is buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City. Madeleine gave birth to a son on August 14, 1912 who was named after his father.

They enjoyed  a dinner based on the final 11-course meal with wine pairings served aboard the Titanic.

The great-granddaughter of Titanic survivor and heiress Molly Brown Helen Benziger also attended the Manhattan party, saying that she was 'thrilled' at the new Titanic design.

Anthony Marshall and his wife Charlene had lived below the radar following his criminal conviction in 2009.

They swapped a charmed existence of dinners, chauffeur-driven cars and charity balls for hospital appointments, meetings with lawyers and court dates.

The 88-year-old, who is in poor health following open heart surgery, is estranged from his twin sons.

They testified that their father and stepmother were abusing Astor, withholding medical treatment and leaving her to lie drenched in her own urine.

Marshall was found guilty of defrauding his mother out of millions, money she had inherited from her third husband, hotelier and realtor Vincent Astor.

Brooke Astor, who died in 2007 aged 
105, had devoted her life to philanthropy, giving eye-watering sums of 
money to the St. Regis Hotel, the New York Public Library and the 
Metropolitan Art Museum.

The multimillionaire, who had 
Alzheimer's, was left to spend her last days in heart-breaking 
conditions - her dogs messing over her Park Avenue apartment while she 
napped in her own urine with no one to help, the Post previously 
reported.

The jury convicted Marshall of 14 counts, including first-degree grand larceny and scheming to defraud.

Vast wealth: Brooke Astor's Westchester home - most of the furniture was auctioned at Sotheby's last year and the proceeds went to philanthropic causes in New York City

Taken: While the furniture was initially given to Marshall from Brooke Astor's will, he will now not see any of the money after being found guilty of defrauding the elderly woman
