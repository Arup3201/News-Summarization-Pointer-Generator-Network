This heartbreaking picture shows the medals of a soldier killed in Afghanistan pinned to the coat of his five-month-old daughter - just a month after her mother proved his paternity in a landmark case.

Lexie-Mai Wade was pictured among the crowds at the homecoming parade of her father's 3rd Battalion Yorkshire Regiment as they marched through the city of York today.

Her mother Emma Hickman, 19, won the right to officially name Daniel Wade, who died in a Taliban bomb attack in March, as the father of the five-month-old after a legal wrangle over his DNA.

It comes shortly after Emma Hickman, pictured left with Lexie-Mai, was forced to push the Ministry of Defence to release Private Daniel Wade's DNA to prove his paternity and name him on her daughter's birth certificate

Because Private Wade and Miss Hickman were 
unmarried, she had to press the Ministry of Defence to release his DNA 
so she could prove paternity and name him on the birth certificate.

Mother and daughter were today among 
the crowds to welcome home the soldiers who have recently completed a 
six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan and to remember their ten fallen 
comrades - including Private Wade.

The 500 soldiers of the 3rd 
Battalion, the Yorkshire Regiment, based in Wiltshire, marched through 
the city for an inspection and salute in front of guests, families and 
onlookers before attending the service this afternoon.

The Duke of York Andrew, who is 
Colonel-in-Chief of the Yorkshire Regiment, took part in the service to 
celebrate the regiment's return from Afghanistan.

He gave a reading during the ceremony at York Minster, where he met Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu.

The soldiers paid tribute to those 
killed in out in Afghanistan - including Corporal Jake Hartley, Private 
Anton Frampton and Private Daniel Wilford who died when their Warrior 
armoured vehicle was blown up by a Taliban improvised explosive device 
in March.

Private Wade and Private Christopher 
Kershaw - also of 3rd Battalion - and Sergeant Nigel Coupe - of 1st 
Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, on secondment to the 
Yorkshire Regiment - were also killed in the attack.

Private Tom Wroe and Sergeant Gareth Thursby were shot dead in Helmand province in September.

Private Gregg Stone was shot during 
an operation to rescue a policeman kidnapped by insurgents in June. 
Kingsman Ryan Ward died soon after returning home.

Lieutenant Colonel Zac Stenning, 
commanding officer of 3rd Battalion, said the ceremony was an 'immensely
important' occasion for his troops.

He said: 'It captures two things - 
the success of the tour and also the poignancy and dignity of 
remembering our fallen brothers in arms who haven't come home this 
summer.'

He added that he was honoured that Andrew attended and said the prince had been keen to show his support.
