Police in Spain are investigating the death of a nativity donkey which collapsed after being sat on by a heavyset man.

The five-month-old donkey was being held in a pen which was not meant to be accessed by the public for a Christmas fair in the town of Lucena in Cordoba.

But one visitor  climbed over the fence and sat on the fragile animal's back to have his picture taken, while grinning and posing for the camera.

The photo of the portly man grinning as he poses on the donkey - which later died - has been widely shared on social media, where animal lovers have reacted with outrage and called on the town hall to take action

Two days later, residents noticed that the donkey, named Platero, was barely able to stand, and he was taken to a local vet. 

The animal was then urgently transferred to a specialist clinic, but due to the severity of his internal injuries he had to be put down.

The photograph of the portly man grinning as he poses on the donkey has since been widely shared on social media, where animal lovers have reacted with outrage and called for the town hall to take action.

Two animal rights organisations, Asociación de Defensa del Borrico (Adebo) and the Círculo Animalista de Podemos Lucena reported the incident to the police.

The donkey was being used in a nativity scene in the town of Lucena in Cordoba, Spain

'The donkey was literally squashed by a man,' they said in their complaint.

'The man tried to pose 'galloping,' with his almost 150kg of weight on the fragile body of the animal, squashing it to death.'

Police have asked a vet to determine the cause of the donkey's death, and the town hall has said it will take legal action if it is found that the man sitting on the animal's back is responsible.

The charities say they are repulsed and outraged and will move 'heaven and earth' to have the man prosecuted if it is proved that the man's weight killed the donkey. 

Traditional nativity scenes, known as 'belenes', are found across towns and cities Spain in the lead-up to Christmas, and often include live animals such as sheep and donkeys.
