In the collection the photographer creates 'what if' scenarios where she poses as the wife or partner of each man, adopting the clothing and mannerisms of each woman.

Each portrait offers a different insight into how different family life can be with the photos representing a variety of classes and backgrounds.

The images are set in the man's typical surroundings, often accompanied by his children and/or pets and Dita has even included her own daughter in her images.

Dita says that her work has helped her to understand many different family dynamics.

She told Slate.com 'Taking self-portraits with men made me realise how different partners influence one another.'

She added that when it came to creating an authentic family photograph it was important for her to understand each individual family life.

'We talked about the relativity of life events, how little it would take to be born in a different family, have different friends, partners … working together helped me to understand personal views and how to deal with different aspects of life, the importance of various values and how to grasp moments of happiness; this project influenced my perception of the world and myself.'
