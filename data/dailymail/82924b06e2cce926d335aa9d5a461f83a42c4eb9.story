Aeroplane passengers can admire the view, keep up to speed with their flight's progress and find out what is going on 30,000ft below thanks to a new 'glass bottom' iPad app.

The 'glass bottom jet' feature is accessed through inflight wi-fi from 10,000 ft and allows passengers to track their flight by watching a computerised image of the plane on their handheld device.

Icons also appear on the ground below for users to access a range of interactive content - including Wikipedia pages, photographs and social network updates related to the landmarks and places they are passing overhead.

The app has been launched by Delta Air Lines and gives iPad users the ability to book and check-in for flights and download their boarding pass onto the device.

It also features destination guides and 'inflight entertainment' pages, which include suggested music, film and book downloads related to a passenger's destination.

Glen Hauenstein, Delta's executive vice president for network planning, revenue management and marketing, said: 'Our goal is to simplify the digital experience across the touch points where our customers already spend their time by making their interactions with Delta easy and intuitive.

'The incredible functionality and innovation found in the new iPad app embodies all that we're doing to further improve the digital experience customers have with Delta.

'All of this represents the largest investment to delta.com and digital technology in more than a decade.

'Customers can rely on Delta to provide innovative tools throughout their travel experience that put them in control and give them the information they need, when they need it.

'We'll continue to provide new and interesting ways to plan, share and connect, so that traveling with Delta keeps getting better.'

Delta, which has more than 800 wi-fi enabled aircraft in its fleet and around 160 million customers every year, has developed the app as part of the company's $140 million investment in technology.
