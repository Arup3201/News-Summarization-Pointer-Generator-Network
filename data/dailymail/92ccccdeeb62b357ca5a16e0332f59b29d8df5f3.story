A former middle school band teacher has been suspended after being accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student.

Bridgett Szychulski, 31, was the band teacher for the Lenape Middle School in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, at the time of the alleged incident in 2012.

She was arraigned on Tuesday afternoon on charges including involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault, indecent assault and statutory sexual assault.

Bridgett Szychulski's attorney has sought leniency for his client and told the judge that the mother of one was in the middle of a complicated pregnancy

Szychulski is accused of having sex with the 14-year-old boy ‘at least’ three times - once in her vehicle and twice at the middle school, including her office and a storage room near the band room.

District Judge Regina Armitage set bail at $500,000 unsecured. He also banned her from having contact with juveniles other than her 4-year-old son, or from contacting any Central Bucks students or employees.

Her attorney, William Goldman, had sought leniency for his client’s bail conditions and told the judge that Szychulski is in the middle of a complicated pregnancy. 

The DA's Office had begun investigating the case in the middle of last week after the alleged abuse had been reported to Childline.
