A Danish woman has defied being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis to run 366 marathons in 365 days.

Annette Fredskov, 41, who has two children, Emilie, 11, and Viktor, 9, with husband Ulrich, ran 26.2 miles every day for a year and topped off her heroic feat of endurance with a double marathon on July 14.

Dozens of supporters ran with Mrs Fredskov as she completed her arduous journey in her home town of Naestved, which is an hour south of capital Copenhagen.

High five: Crowds turned out to support Mrs Fredskov's final run of the year and many supporters ran with her

Three years ago she was diagnosed with the condition, which affects the central nervous system and can cause crippling pain, numerous muscle problems, fatigue and a host of other debilitating effects.

But Mrs Fredskov, who described herself as an 'ordinary woman, mother and wife' refused to bow to the condition and took up running, taking part in her first marathon in Frankfurt, Germany, in October 2010 - an event she described as 'love at first run'.

In early 2011, she began to take part in a series of small marathons in Denmark known as 'cannonballs' and by the end of the year she had run 51 of them.

After she crossed the line. bringing her epic ordeal to an emotional close, she said: 'It has been a completely wonderful day. My dream has come true, and it can not be described with words.

'It has been a gigantic feast of running and I am completely overwhelmed, happy, grateful and tired.'

Stoic: Mrs Fredskov refuses to let the condition affect her life

She credits the marathons, which she completes in around five hours, for her well-being and ability to cope with the disease.

Mrs Fredskov said she wants her efforts to inspire others diagnosed with the condition.

However, the day after her joy was mixed with extreme fatigue. She wrote in her blog: 'When I woke up this morning, I felt like I was run over by a steamroller. Flat, tired and heavy.'

Mrs Fredskov said that one of the reasons she began her gruelling challenge was to inspire other MS sufferers .

She said: 'It should not deter you from living life to the fullest and going for your dreams.

'It is my hope that I am able to inspire others to do what they dream about.'

Arduous: The pain of more than 50 miles of running in one day takes its toll

She said: 'Marathons are the best things that have happened to my body and soul'

She credits the marathons, which she completes in around five hours, for her well-being and ability to cope with the disease.

'Three years ago I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and today I have - without drugs - no discomfort or symptoms. I believe that racing and the marathons have a big impact on that,' she said.

'Two years ago, I thought the same thing most people think: "Running a marathon isnâ€™t healthy. A marathon is damaging to the body and it takes a long time to recover".

'I have now changed my mind. Marathons are the best things that have happened to my body and soul.'

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a condition of the central nervous system.

It is the most common disabling neurological disease among young adults and affects around 100,000 people in the UK.

Side effects vary case to case but include muscle weakness and spasms, reduced coordination and balance, speech problems, fatigue, chronic pain and depression

MS is most often diagnosed in people between the ages of 20 and 40, and women are almost twice as likely to develop it as men.

Once diagnosed, MS stays with you for life, but treatments and specialists can help sufferers to manage many symptoms.

The cause is not known and a cure has yet to be identified.
