Miami Dolphins offensive lineman Richie Incognito, 30, is alleged to have sent teammate Jonathan Martin a series of threatening text messages and voice mails.

In one of the disturbing exchanges Incognito referred to Martin, 24, as a ‘half-n*****’, while in another he threatened to defecating in his young teammate's mouth.

Incognito also made reference to tracking down members of Martin's family and harming them in other texts, reports CBS Sports.

Bullying claims: Miami Dolphins Guard Richie Incognito, right, has been accused of bullying younger players though he denies the claims

Incognito was indefinitely suspended by the NFL on Monday morning while the league investigates the situation involving the rookie player.

It is the latest development in a controversial case that first came to light last week when Martin shockingly announced he was taking a leave of absence from the team.

Martin accused Incognito of player misconduct after an incident that occurred in the team cafeteria last Monday.

Over the weekend it was alleged that almost all the veteran Dolphins players have forced newer recruits to fund their lavish lifestyles 
including $30,000 dinners. 

Leave: Miami Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin, 24, pictured, has taken a personal leave of absence from the team which has been blamed on the persistent teasing of his teammates

According to reports on ESPN and in the Miami Herald on Sunday, the alleged bank-rolling is partly the reason for Martin's shock leave of absence from the team.

ESPN
claims Incognito got Martin to contribute $15,000 to 
help finance a trip to Vegas last summer, even though he didn't attend. 
However, Incognito quickly disputed the report on Twitter.

ESPN's Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefter released a report regarding Incognito on ESPN.com, saying that several sources insisted Incognito was involved.

They said the incident was not isolated and extended to 2012, when Martin was a second-round draft pick by the team.

One source said any emotional issues Martin is experiencing are directly related to his harassment.

Reporter Adam Schefter tweeted on Monday some of Incognito's alleged messages to Martin

On
Friday, Dolphins coach Joe Philbin said, 'This is something we take 
very seriously and will not be tolerated'.

Incognito has been playing with the 
Dolphins since 2010 and has been in the NFL since 2006, originally with 
the St. Louis Rams. He was selected to the Pro Bowl just last season as 
an offensive guard.

Meanwhile, the Herald reported that one unnamed young player had coughed up so much cash to veterans that he's gone broke.

Adam Beasley tweeted: 'Recently, a younger player was handed the tab 
for a $30,000 team dinner. The rookie minimum this year is around 
$400.000.'

Two tweets from Jared Odrick and Will Davis support the accusation.

'Everything tastes better when 
rookies pay for it,' Odrick tweeted on November 2, while Davis wrote 'I 
just seen a dinner bill for $30,000... WOW #RookieNight.'

Jeff Darlington from NFL.com reported the suspension on Twitter

'Sources': ESPN TV personality, Adam Schefter, who first broke the story, is being attacked by Incognito on Twitter who says Schefter is 'slandering' his name

The team came out on Sunday labelling the accusations of bullying 'speculation.'

They added that their number one concern was Martin's health and well-being.

'The
Miami Dolphins, including Coach Joe Philbin and Jonathan's teammates, 
have been in communication with Jonathan and his family since his 
departure from the club and continue to be in contact. Our primary 
concern for Jonathan is his overall health and well-being,' the 
statement read.

'As an
organization, we take any accusations of player misconduct seriously. 
The notion of bullying is based on speculation and has not been 
presented to us as a concern from Jonathan or anyone else internally. 
The reports that the NFLPA is investigating our players are inaccurate.

'Additionally, the NFL offered its assistance during this time, which we 
appreciated and gladly accepted. We will continue to make Jonathan's 
health and well-being a focus as we do with all of our players.'

After ESPN 
reporters Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefer's latest story, Incognito 
took to Twitter to rubbish the claims against him, writing 
'@AdamSchefter Stop slandering my name. You hide behind "sources" who 
are not man enough to put their name behind the BS you report.'

Three minutes later, the player 
added: '@AdamSchefter This is the second time you have tried to drag my 
name through the mud with lies.'

It
was first reported on Friday that tackle Martin had taken a 
personal leave of absence from the team because of persistent bullying 
and teasing at the hands of certain teammates.

Martin,
nicknamed 'Big Weirdo' by some teammates has apparently been plagued by
bullying since joining Miami as a 2012 second-round draft choice.

The
latest taunts prompted Martin to leave Dolphins headquarters last Monday 
after a group of players stood up and left when he tried joining them 
for lunch.

The incident caused Martin, 24, to finally reach his limit and walk out.

Educated: The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University

The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University.

He
played in last Sunday's loss at New England, then missed practice 
during the week. He was replaced by Tyson Clabo in Thursday night's game
against Cincinnati.

A 
second-round draft pick from Stanford, Martin started every game at 
right tackle as a rookie last year. He switched to left tackle this 
season, then moved back to the right side last month in a reshuffling of
the Dolphins' struggling offensive line.

'You can approach this two different ways,' Martin said regarding his latest position switch at the time.

'You
can go in the tank and be one of those guys that moans and is a cancer 
in the locker room, or you can be a professional and play as hard as you
can. My mindset is I'm going to go out there and do whatever I can to 
help the team win.'

Pass 
protection has been a problem for Miami all season. Ryan Tannehill went 
into the Bengals game with an NFL-high 32 sacks, and the Dolphins (3-4) 
were saddled with a four-game losing streak.

Martin's agent didn't respond to requests for comment. The walkout raises questions about Martin's future with the franchise.
