Senate Democrats are urging President Barack Obama to hold off on an immigration announcement until after Congress passes legislation to fund the government through next year.

Members of the Democratic caucus in upper chamber are worried that imminent action by the president will provoke Republicans and derail debate on a critical spending bill, which must be enacted by Dec. 11 to avoid a government shut down.

Democrats in the House, on the other hand, are pressing Obama to act without further delay, after having put an executive order protecting millions of illegal immigration on the back burner for several months already until after this month's midterm elections.

The White House had not given any indication of when the president will go public with his plans other than to say that it will be sometime this year, again refusing to discuss the topic today. A 10-point plan leaked last week by Fox News revealed that he may do it as soon as this Friday, however.

To act on immigration or not to act on immigration, that is the question before President Barack Obama this week. Senate Democrats want the president to wait until Congress has passed a spending bill that will keep the government's doors open through next year, while hardcore immigration advocates want him to act before the Thanksgiving holiday

It also detailed immigrant populations the president should consider shielding from removal proceedings, including parents of citizen children and illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, defined as age 16 and under, before 2010.

All told, up to five million illegal immigrants could be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely under Obama's executive order if he takes the actions outlined. 

The impending declaration sent shudders through Congress, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told Reuters it would be his preference for Obama to wait until after the government's fiscal house was in order.

'The president has said he’s going to do the executive action. The question is when. It’s up to him,' Reid said. 'But I’d like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it.' 

Reid has since backtracked, however, saying Monday night that 'it should be done now.' 

Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware told The Hill on Monday that he would like to see Obama postpone his adjustments to the immigration system even beyond the end of the legislative session.

'If I were the president, what I’d say to the Congress — House, Senate, Democrat or Republican — I’m going to give you a little bit of time and in the new Congress expect you to do something,' Carper said.

Rather than making vague threats to Congress about the costs of inaction, Carper told the Hill Obama should set in stone a date for Republicans in the legislative branch to come to the table with their own reforms. If they don't meet it, he said, then Obama should proceed.

'I would say not the first month, maybe the first quarter' of the new Congress, he said.

The notion of continued inaction is unacceptable to influential immigration groups and their partners in the House, however.

'Waiting doesn’t make sense,' Clarissa Martínez-De-Castro, a principal at the National Council of La Raza, told The Hill. 

'This is about millions of American families who’ve been waiting for a very long time for something to be done,' she said. 

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, center, speaks alongside US military veterans, service members and immigration reform advocates, during a Nov. 12 press conference at the U.S. Capitol urging Obama to move forward with immigration reform as soon as possible

At a press conference last week that brought together immigration reform advocates and members of Congress, Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer said, 'What the president needs to do is give immediate and significant relief to those families that are going to be wrenched apart and living in fear.'

'I will be proud to support the president of the United States in acting in a big, bold manner,' he announced.

Illinois Rep. Luis Gutierrez also said the president needs to make a 'bold' and 'generous' statement in the coming days, especially with the holiday season just around the corner.

'I've always said that the blessings of Thanksgiving should be bountiful this year for millions of immigrants that have been waiting for the Congress to act,' Gutierrez said last Thursday on MSNBC.  

On Monday he implied that he may have insight into the president's plans, telling the cable network that he knows for a fact that the forthcoming proclamation is 'going to be big.'

'I don't want to say more than that. I've been, as you know, we've spoken before. I said it was going to be at least five million before. And it seems that that's going to be a number that we're looking at,' he told host Alex Wagner. 'Look, I cannot tell you any more than that.' 

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not confirm on Tuesday if the president had even received the Department of Homeland Security's recommendations yet, let alone the existence of a detailed plan.

Earnest also said the president didn't have very much time to work on the issue while he was in Asia last week but he plans to study it this week now that he is back in Washington.

He did concede that the White House had weighed the pros and cons of waiting until after the spending fight, and said, 'I think the fact is you could provably argue this both ways.'

The Obama spokesman said Republicans are 'well aware' that the president is going to act and his 'sense' therefore is that they will try to preemptively pass legislation trying to stop him, which Earnest said was 'unwarranted.'

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest refused to shed light today on Obama's anticipated immigration plans. He did however confirm that the White House was debating whether or not to wait until after the spending fight had concluded

If Republicans would just pass comprehensive immigration reform, he argued, the president could 'throw away' and planned executive actions.

House Speaker John Boehner has stated time and time again that he will not bring the  bill passed in the Senate more than a year ago, to the floor of the House. He instead prefers to tackle problems with the immigration system one by one.

In anticipation of the Obama's executive action, Republicans in the House and Senate have indeed focused their immigration efforts on schemes to block Obama through the legislative process.

Among those, according to Politico, is a plan to bring an immigration bill to the floor next year, when the GOP has a larger share of seats in both chambers, that would enhance border security while requiring Obama to enforce existing immigration laws.

Another pathway under consideration is passage a short term continuing resolution that would fund the government through the first quarter of next year until Republicans officially hold a majority of seats in Congress.

The House may also decide to fund every department of the government through the end of fiscal year 2015 except the Department of Homeland Security, which it would give short-term funding to as a stop gap until newly elected Republicans are seated.

Conservatives in the House and Senate favor a measure that fund the government while explicitly stating that Obama cannot use any of the money appropriated through it to support activities associated with his executive order, which would essentially freeze DHS' ability to implement it.

Boehner said Thursday at a press conference that 'all options on the table,' however House Republicans have since clarified that a government shut down is off limits. 

As Sen. Rand Paul pointed out on Monday evening on Hannity, however, using the spending bill as a vehicle to outmaneuver Obama has its limitations.

Even if Republicans recruited enough of their Democratic colleagues in the Senate to pass a bill tying the president's hands on immigration will land itself at the top of Obama's veto list.

Taking Obama to court may be Republicans' only realistic avenue to stop him from authorizing his own rules in the next two years before he leaves office.

'I think with regard to immigration reform, he’s doing something that Congress has not instructed him to do and in fact has instructed him otherwise, so I think the Supreme Court would strike it down,' Paul stated. 

'That takes a while, but that may be the only recourse short of a new president.'
