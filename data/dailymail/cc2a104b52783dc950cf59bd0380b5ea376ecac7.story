Footage has emerged of police in Ohio aggressively questioning the girlfriend of a man who they had just shot dead for holding a BB gun in a Walmart store.

An officer from the Beavercreek department repeatedly demands to know where the slain John Crawford III, 22, got his 'gun' from in an interview with his weeping girlfriend, Tasha Thomas.

Thomas, who is not told until the end of the interview that her loved one has died, is clearly distressed by the line of question from the disbelieving officer, Rodney Curd, who repeatedly suggests she is lying.

Questioning: Beavercreek police officer Rodney Curd, right, is seen in the footage harshly questioning Tasha Thomas, the girlfriend of John Crawford III, who was shot dead by police in August

Repeated: Curd asks Thomas again and again whether she knew Crawford had a gun before going into the Walmart where he was shot. In fact he didn't have a gun, and picked up a replica from a shelf

Curd, who warns Thomas she could be jailed for what she says in the interview, also suggests that she looks 'messed up' and could be drunk or high on drugs in footage obtained by the Guardian.

Thomas breaks down in tears several times in the interview following the August 5 incident, which focuses on the moments before Crawford was shot dead after picking up a BB gun in the Beavercreek Walmart outlet. 

A 911 caller had told police the replica gun was actually a real assault rifle, which led officer Sean Williams to gun him down. A grand jury later decided not to indict him for the killing.

Tasha Thomas swore repeatedly on her own life, and the graves of her dead relatives, that she was being honest, despite Curd telling her she was phrasing her answers like 'someone not telling the truth', and saying he expected her testimony to change later.

Officer Curd: 'You and John went into Walmart, at some point as I understand it, John produced a gun. You were with him just moments before that, weren't you?'

Tasha Thomas: Yes, sir

Curd: OK, Tell me where he got the gun from.

Thomas: Sir I don't know - I honestly don't know.

Curd: And the truth is you knew at some point he did carry a gun, isn't it?

Thomas: No sir, I didn't know. I swear I didn't know.

Curd: You see, I'm having trouble with this.

Thomas: [Through tears] Please, give me a lie detector test! 

Footage from 94-minute interview, released to the news site by the Ohio attorney general, shows Curd grilling Thomas at length on her version of events, at times banging his hand on the table for emphasis. 

He also pursues a theory that Crawford had taken his own, real, gun into the store in order to shoot his ex-girlfriend, LeeCee Johnson.

At one point he asks her: 'Did he ever mention "I'm gonna shoot that bitch", or something like that?'

Thomas replied that he didn't, and that as far as she was aware she was in Cincinnati and not in the store.

Although the grand jury concluded that the shooting was justified, federal officials are looking into the case.

Earlier this month it was reported that Officer Williams, who also killed a man in 2010, will remain on leave until after that investigation.

MailOnline has contacted the police department for comment.
