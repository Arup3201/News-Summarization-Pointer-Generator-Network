Britain's Victoria Pendleton and Jess Varnish were yesterday disqualified from the women's team sprint after officials judged they had overtaken too early.

The pair were relegated out of the gold medal final after Pendleton came past Varnish before the designated changeover line on the straight of the track.

Riders must change over within an allocated area, similar to sprinters in a relay race.

Pendleton's face is one of dejection but she still has two more chances to win gold at these Olympics

It put an end to Varnish's Olympic hopes, but Pendleton will still ride for gold in the women's sprint and the keirin.

The crowd voiced their displeasure 
after the announcement was made and the pair were consoled by members of
 the men's team sprint team, who won gold despite Philip Hindes' crash controversy.

The pair had looked in good shape and had set a new world record in their heat - though China did beat it minutes later.

Germany, who replaced Great Britain in the gold medal race, clinched gold from China, while Australia beat Ukraine to take bronze.

Afterwards, Pendleton said: 'It is just one of those things. Now and again, these things happen.

'Overall,
 we've had a really excellent run and I thought we were in for a gold or
 silver ride. I guess all I can do now is concentrate on tomorrow.

'We
 were a bit too overwhelmed, a bit too eager. Jess moves up the track 
and I just come through, I just go. It's not Jess's fault it's not my 
fault.'

Rob Hayles, Double Olympic medallist 
and BBC cycling commentator at the Velodrome explained: 'I believe it 
was Victoria Pendleton taking over too early.

'There
 are two points on the straight, and like athletics where you have to 
hand over the baton, you have to change over within a certain place on 
the track.

'Vicky must not 
take over before a certain point or after a certain point and they have 
changed over outside the allocated area on the track.'

BBC pundit said: 'It's the Olympic Games, it's the biggest thing and to spend four years getting ready for it only to lose in a fraction of a second is gut wrenching.'

The
 Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were in the audience at the Velodrome in 
the Olympic Park and they later saw the British men's team sprint 
quartet set a world record and win gold.

The win increased Britain's medal haul on the day to three golds and three silvers - just a few short of 'Super Saturday' at the Beijing Olympics when Team GB won four golds, one silver and four bronzes.
