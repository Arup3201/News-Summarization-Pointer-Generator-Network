A couple illegally neutered a kitten and a dog for friends who could not afford the surgery, leaving the animals with painful wounds and in need of extensive veterinarian care, police have said.

Lisa Clothier, 48, and her husband, 45-year-old Harold Clothier, from Argyle County, New York went on the run for more than a year after they were initially charged with the crimes.

But when police learned that the couple, who have been wanted on arrest warrants since 2011, had returned to New York from Florida, authorities arrested them on Tuesday.

The charges stem from 2011, when 
friends told Lisa Clothier that they could not afford to get their dog 
and kitten neutered, the Glens Falls Post-Star reported.

Arrest: Lisa and Harold Clothier have been arrested after more than a year on the run. They were charged in 2011 with illegally neutering animals, which left a kitten and a dog in need of emergency veterinarian care

She told the friends that she was a veterinary technician and could carry out the operations - when she in fact worked at a Wal-Mart in Queensbury, police said.

The dog needed extensive care after it chewed a hole in its abdomen to deal with the pain coming from its wound following the botched procedure, officials said.

The cat, who was owned by one of Clothier's co-workers, suffered injuries when she allegedly performed the procedure on the wrong part of the cat's genitals.

The owner took her pet to Northway Emergency Veterinary Clinic with the severe injury - sparking an investigation and leading to the arrest of Clothier.

Authorities said there was no indication she was paid or that she was a licensed veterinary technician, the Post-Star reported.

Accused: Lisa Clothier told her friends she had a license to carry out the procedures even though she did not, and her husband held the animals down during the procedures

Troopers
also said that Clothier's husband, Harold, was with her during both incidents and 
helped her to hold down the animals.

They were both charged with unauthorized practice of a profession and misdemeanor animal cruelty in one county, Argyle, and misdemeanor animal cruelty in another, Queensbury.

Before they fled New York, Harold Clothier had pleaded guilty but failed to pay $500 
fines, while Lisa Clothier pleaded guilty to misdemeanor animal cruelty and was expected to be sentenced to 3 years on probation and cover the cat's medical bills.

While court action was still pending, they moved from Argyle in Washington County to Florida/

The Clothiers were arrested Tuesday and sent to Warren County Jail to await a Monday court appearance.
