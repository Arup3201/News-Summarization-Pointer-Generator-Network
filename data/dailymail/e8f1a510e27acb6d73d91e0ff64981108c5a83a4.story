A couple who bought a micro-pig were stunned when their pint-sized family pet turned into a 670lb giant.

Steve Jenkins and Derek Walter from Ontario, Canada, adopted Esther thinking she would only grow to around 70lb, a respectable five stone.

But they were tricked and two-year-old Esther has not stopped growing and is now heavier than a fully-grown female polar bear.

Feedling time! Vast Esther joins Steve and Derek's two pet dogs for a bite to eat in the farm kitchen

The couple adopted Esther after a friend who described her as a 'micro-pig' - she's now the size of a polar bear

The two-year-old sow, who is toilet-trained, is now nearly ten times her expected size.

She eats £30 of vegan food each week, enjoying a diet of rolled oats, barley and corn as well as fresh fruit and vegetables like over ripe bananas and vegetable peelings.

She has become so big that the couple had to move into a farm to create enough room for her and their two dogs and a cat.

Steve, who works in the property industry, said: 'We lived in denial for a long-time. Friends would come over and say 'she's getting bigger' and Derek and I would say 'no she's not'.

'But soon she was standing up to steal things off the kitchen counters, the couch became smaller, and of course there was the weight gain.

'We just adapted and loved her more. What else could we do? It wasn't her fault and we would never give up a pet.' 

As Esther the Wonder Pig, the giant porker has more than 230,000 friends on Facebook 

Her antics, such as playing in the snow in Canada's freezing winter, has earned her legions of fans online

Derek and Steve adopted Esther as an adorable piglet who they didn't expect to exceed around 70lb in size

The couple who've moved into a farm, say Esther has changed their lives and they 'love her more'

Steve said: 'Since we moved to the farm she has decided she needs to be close to us and now sleeps beside our bed with her mattress on the floor.

'She still on occasion climbs up on to our bed for a nap during the day.'

Esther has now found fame on Facebook as Esther the Wonder Pig and has more than 230,000 friends who follow updates on their her exploits. 

Derek and Steve post pictures and video of the pig and sell calendars, postcards and mugs featuring the pink porker.

Followers can watch her snoozing in a nest of stolen blankets, monopolising the sofa - as well as the dog bed - or sprawling across the living room floor leaving little  room for anyone else.

The pair have now created another Facebook page, Esther's Kitchen, to feature the vegan food they prepare for their rambunctious pet, including spinach lasagne and chocolate chip granola bites. 

Speaking about Esther's online popularity, Steve added: 'It is still surreal and absolutely mind-boggling.

'We started Esther's page just as a way for immediate friends and family to stay in touch with us and Esther's antics.

The porker clearly loves to eat and gets through £30 of fruit, vegetables and grains each week

'But one of those friends shared Esther's page on an animal-related website and the next thing we knew Esther's page had 10,000 likes and it never stopped.

'Derek and I are Esther's voice and some days it is really challenging to come up with new quips and I will sit there staring at a picture until something comes to me.

'Other days it's as if I can read Esther's thoughts and I swear she can convey them with her eyes and her smile.

'People's reaction to meeting Esther still amazes us, it's like they're meeting a movie star or royalty.

'Even now people are amazed by her size and her awareness.

'It is as if she knows she is famous and that is her role, that she is changing the world's view of her kind and their amazing abilities to think, feel and be loved.'

The animal, thought to be a commercial pig, looks fetching in a patterned housecoat the right shade of pink
