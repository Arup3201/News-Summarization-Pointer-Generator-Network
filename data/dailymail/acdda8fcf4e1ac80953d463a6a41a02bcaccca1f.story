A police investigation has been launched into former Australian elite swimming coach Greg Hodge after two women alleged he inappropriately touched them when they were teenagers.

The pair came forward earlier this week and claimed the incidents happened while they were students at Sutherland's Aquadot Swim Club - where Mr Hodge was a coach, The Sunday Telegraph reported. 

Both incidents are alleged to have happened in the 1980s.

Two teenagers have alleged former elite swim coach Greg Hodge inappropriately touched them in the 1980s

Mr Hodge, who was once an Olympic swim official, now owns The Swim Factory in Perth, Western Australia with his wife, Sue.

The Swim Factory offers classes for babies through to children up to 12 years old. 

He is a former director of Swimming Australia, New South Wales Institute of Sport and Western Australia Institute of Sport. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Hodge for a response in relation to these claims.

A NSW Police spokeswoman has confirmed the two women's claims were being investigated.

'New South Wales police are investigating a number of reports,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'The investigation is in its infancy and police are assessing the information provided.

'New South Wales police will also urge anyone who believes they are a victim of a crime to report the matter to police who will investigate.'

One of the women was aged 13 years when she alleges Mr Hodge touched her while she was being fitted into her new racing swimsuit.

She claims he reached into the swimsuit under the guise he was ensuring it fit properly.

Further, the woman claims Mr Hodge wandered into the female change rooms while she and her fellow swimmers - some also in their teenage years - were taking showers.

The second woman said she was touched by Mr Hodge when she was 15 years old.

It comes after the News Corp newspaper reported on allegations involving the swim teacher kissing a young female swimmer on the cheek at a meet.

He previously denied there was anything inappropriate about the incident and said an investigation launched by Swimming Western Australia found he had not done anything wrong.
