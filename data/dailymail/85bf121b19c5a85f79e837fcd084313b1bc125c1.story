Chelsea expect Cesc Fabregas to be available for Jose Mourinho's team next week after scans showed no serious damage to his hamstrings.

Fabregas returned to London and will miss Spain's games against Belarus and Germany after reporting discomfort in his hamstring muscles but is expected to fit to face West Bromwich Albion on Saturday week.

No tears of muscle damage was evident on his scans and Chelsea's medical team believe a few days' rest and treatment will solve the problem.

'When a player of his calibre tells you that he is injured, you have to believe him,' said Vicente del Bosque, but there is clearly some concern in Spain about Mourinho's influence on Fabregas and Diego Costa.

Mourinho spent weeks grumbling about Costa's need for a break from football, to rest groin and hamstring injuries, until Del Bosque finally agreed to leave him out of these two games, the Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus and the friendly against Germany.

Fabregas has started every game for Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League. He started the season in sparkling form, although his last two performances against Maribor and Liverpool were among his lest influential since his summer transfer from Barcelona.
