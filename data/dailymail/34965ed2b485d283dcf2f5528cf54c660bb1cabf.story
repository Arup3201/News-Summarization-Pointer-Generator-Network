A young child has become only the second person in the U.S. to develop a rare form of flu that is usually found in pigs rather than humans.

The Minnesota child has developed the H1N2 virus, which does not usually infect humans. The only previous case was in Michigan four years ago.

Medical officials have warned this shows how tough flu can be to pin down, after 6,000 people died in the U.S. from the H1N1 strain in 2009.

‘Typically influenzas change a little bit,’ Dr Aaron DeVries of the Minnesota Department of Health told CBS affiliate WCCO.

‘When the virus changes substantially, that is when a pandemic can occur and that is what happened in 2009.’

Doctors are not too worried about the case because the child recovered fast and did not make anyone around him sick with H1N2, reported WCCO.

H1N2 is more commonly found in pigs in the Upper Midwest - but as the boy had no contact with the animals, the virus must have mutated.

The strain is not covered by the current flu shot, which has a vaccine developed by experts after the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, reported WCCO.

‘We do need a better vaccine and a better mechanism to rapidly develop vaccines,’ Dr DeVries told WCCO.

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman said the public should not be concerned by this new case of H1N2.

‘Discovery of these novel influenza viruses shows that our surveillance systems are working,’ spokesman Tom Skinner told Fox News.

Meanwhile the H3N2 strain - a mix of pig, human and bird flu viruses - was recently found in a child in West Virginia, who later recovered.

There have been ten other reports of H3N2 infection across the U.S. in the past before the West Virginia case, reported ABC News.
