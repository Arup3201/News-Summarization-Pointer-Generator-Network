For generations Dover has stood as an indomitable symbol of Britain's
freedom and independence.

And now residents have proved they have earned the reputation after forcing the government to remove the port from their list of assets up for grabs.

The town, with its white cliffs, port and sprawling castle stood at the very edge of the nation's frontier with the Continent but it was nearly flogged to our former age-old enemy - France.

Dover, Europe's busiest port, was going to be sold off to help pay of the Government's record debt levels but was saved after massive local opposition

But now Dame Vera Lynn can relax as in the face of public opposition the port has been saved from the prospect of falling under French control as the government scrapped plans to sell it off to the highest bidder – rumoured to be the local authority of Calais.

Transport minister Simon Burns withdrew Dover from the table of trophy assets -  including the UK's air traffic control 
system, the student loans company and the Tote bookmaker - which are being sold  to help cut the country's record £1.1trillion debt

Europe's busiest passenger port Dover handles 13 million passengers and 5milion vehicles, transporting £50billion worth of goods year on year.

In a ministerial statement accompanying the decision Mr Burn's said he could not guarantee 'sufficient level of enduring community participation in the port' if it was sold off.

Transport minister Simon Burns announced that the port was no longer on the table and referred to petitions and campaigns in his letter of explanation

He wrote in a letter explaining his decision: 'The secretary of state also noted the strength of local opposition to the proposed sale and that this might create uncertainty about a sale at this time.

'It is uncertain what price would be achieved in the current climate.'

The leading bidder was rumoured to be Nord-pas-de-Calais regional council, which also owns Calais. 
The French port is just 21 miles away across the Channel

The Dover People’s Port Trust Ltd, which demonstrates the local opposition, has some 1,200 paid up members and 97.5 per cent of them opposed the sell off plans.

They campaigned for "Keeping the nation's gateway forever England" and had a string of celebrity supporters including Dame Vera

Mr Burns also recognised that more than 770 people and organisations had made formal representations and more than 6,500 had signed three separate petitions against the sale when making his decision.

The letter said key concerns were 'security, immigration and its historic significance'.

In order to avoid the port falling into foreign hands some of the local residents had clubbed together to propose buying it for the community.

Dover's Conservative MP, Charlie Elphicke, told the Guardian that the town's "magnificent victory" saving the port for the nation was the "best Christmas present the people of Dover could have".

He said: "The port of Dover is the gateway to our nation and should be forever England as much as Stonehenge and Buckingham Palace. The whole community is absolutely delighted that it won't end up owned by the French or the Chinese or anyone else.

"Think of the port and the white cliffs and you think of freedom and victory over tyranny."

The chalk cliffs at Dover are treasured natural landmarks and were once named in a poll as Britain's fifth greatest natural wonder

But the chief executive of the Port of Dover, Bob Goldfield, warned that the would have brought  a £10million winfall to the local community and brought in millions more over the next few years. 

The Dover Harbour Board, which own the port, had applied for privitisation in 2010 and it is said the cash was needed to invest in infrastructure.

When Gordon Brown first announced proposals to sell the port he was greeted with an angry reaction and accused of having "no sense of the history" but it was believed it could have netted up to £ 350million for the Treasury.

Since the decision was announced the local residents have fought long and hard to keep the port in the hands of the British.

The sale to the French company 
would have marked a dramatic reversal in the fortunes of the two towns.

Calais was captured by the English under Edward III in 1347, and the 
occupation lasted for more than two centuries. From 1536, the town sent 
MPs to Parliament but the French recaptured the town in 1558.

Other major ports were sold off under the 1991 Ports Act, but Dover was 
retained because of uncertainty over how construction of the Channel 
Tunnel might affect it.
