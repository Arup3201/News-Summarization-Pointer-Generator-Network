The only surviving son of fraudster Bernie Madoff has died after a long battle with lymphoma. 

Andrew Madoff, 48, was surrounded by family as he 'died peacefully' at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York on Wednesday morning, his attorney, Martin Flumenbaum, said in a statement.

His death comes four years after his brother Mark killed himself on the second anniversary of their father's arrest for a $65 billion Ponzi scheme. Bernie Madoff is serving an 150-year prison sentence.

Andrew Madoff, who leaves behind a fiancée and two daughters, first fought mantle cell lymphoma in 2003 and was diagnosed with the disease again in October 2012.

In an interview last year, he blamed the stress of living with his father's arrest for the relapse.

'One way to think of this is the scandal and everything that happened killed my brother very quickly,' Andrew told People magazine in April 2013. 'And it's killing me slowly.' 

As part of his treatment, he had a stem cell transplant in May 2013, followed by chemotherapy.

Although he reconciled with his mother, Ruth, shortly before his second diagnosis, he always said that he had no interest in having contact with his father. 

'Even on my deathbed, I will never forgive him for what he did,' he told People magazine. 'He's already dead to me.'

Bernie Madoff was arrested on December 11, 2008, following his $65 billion Ponzi scheme, which became the largest financial fraud in history. He pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies in March 2009. 

The charges included securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, making false statements, perjury, theft from an employee benefit plan and making false filings with the SEC. 

The scheme was exposed after he told his sons about it and they contacted the FBI.

Andrew told People magazine last year that turning his father in was 'at the same time the easiest decision I ever had to make and the hardest'.

Andrew, who had been head of equities at his father's New York-based company, always denied knowing anything about the scheme.

Struggling to deal with the revelations, Mark Madoff, 46, hanged himself in his apartment on the second anniversary of his father's arrest, as his two-year-old son was asleep in the room next door.

Speaking on the Today show in 2011, Ruth Madoff revealed that the last time she had seen her son Mark alive was the evening her husband had revealed the scheme.

'I'll never get over that,' she said. 'I blame Bernie. It's the worst thing that can happen,'

In January, Bernie Madoff revealed he was battling his own health woes, telling CNBC that he suffered a heart attack last year and had been diagnosed with kidney cancer. 

Defrauded Madoff investors have long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his lies.

No family members were criminally charged.

Mantle cell lymphoma, which most often affects men over the age of 60, is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that causes white blood cells to grow and multiply uncontrollably. It is aggressive and often comes back after patients go into remission.

Survival rates are generally poor compared to other types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and most people do not live longer than five years after diagnosis.

Initial symptoms can include fever, heavy night sweats and weight loss. Patients may also find a lump on their neck, armpits or groin.

Andrew Madoff leaves behind two daughters, Anne and Emily, from his first marriage. He was engaged to Catherine Hooper.
