At least eight professional footballers in English leagues have told their teammates they are gay but do not want to tell the public because they fear fans will turn against them.

The first - and so far only - professional player to come out and continue playing was Justin Fashanu in 1990.

He retired in 1994, blaming his downfall on prejudice in the English game and hanged himself in May 1998 at the age of 37.

Seven of the eight footballers have told Clarke Carlisle, chairman of the Professional Footballer's Association, that they do not want to make their sexual orientation known because they are concerned about the reaction from fans and the media, reports The Observer.

Robbie Rogers recently came out but left Leeds United after the announcement - saying staying in football was 'impossible' if it is known you are gay

In Britain, no professional players have come out since Justin Fashanu in 1990

It comes in the week that basketball player Jason Collins became the first professional sportsman in the United States to reveal he was gay.

Chris Basiurski, chairman of the Gay Football Supporters' Network, told the Observer that he knew of players whose sexuality was known within the game.

He said: 'We have anecdotal evidence that players are out within their clubs and don't have a problem. We are trying to create an atmosphere for people to come out safely, but at the moment there is a big barrier.

'The danger is what happens when a player comes out and gets loads of support and attention, but then start playing badly.

'The worry is that fans will start getting on their backs and they may lose the confidence of their manager and it could be connected to their sexuality.'

In February former Leeds United footballer Robbie Rogers, 25, revealed he was gay, but only after announcing his retirement from the sport.

He said staying in football was 'impossible' if it is known you are gay.

Last week it emerged the American footballer is considering a return with LA Galaxy.

Rogers, who played for Leeds and Stevenage in England, has begun light work in his homeland with David Beckham's former team, but said he isn't ready to fully re-immerse himself in the sport.

'There's a good chance that I might come back to [football] but I need a few months to chill out, hang out with my family, go surf in California, just relax,' he told CNN.

Collins, who played most recently for the Washington Wizards in an NBA career spanning 12 seasons and six teams, came out in an article with Sports Illustrated magazine.

In the United States, basketball player Jason Collins used an article in Sports Illustrated to announce he was gay this week

The 34-year-old wrote: 'I'm a 34-year-old NBA centre. I'm black. And I'm gay.

'I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn't the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, "I'm different."

'If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I'm raising my hand.'
