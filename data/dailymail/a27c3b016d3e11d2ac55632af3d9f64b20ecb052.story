Barcelona are fighting for a league and cup double this season but midfield playmaker Ivan Rakitic enjoyed some time away from the heat of battle with his family to celebrate St George's day.

Rakitic shared a picture with his 425,000 Instagram followers of him with his wife and daughter with the caption 'Happy St George's Day, I will enjoy with my princesses.'

Rakitic's wife, Raquel Mauri, also posted an image of her celebrations with Barcelona star Rakitic.

Rakitic played the full 90 minutes as Barcelona sealed progress to the semi-final of the Champions League with a 5-1 aggregate victory over Paris Saint-Germain thanks to a 2-0 win on Tuesday. 

The Croatia midfielder has been instrumental for Luis Enrique's La Liga-leading side since signing from rivals Sevilla in June.

Barcelona have a two-point lead over Real Madrid in the Spanish league with six games remaining. They also await Friday's Champions League semi-final draw, where they could face Madrid, Juventus or Bayern Munich.
