Fernando Alonso has confirmed he and team-mate Kimi Raikkonen are pulling in the same direction in a bid to haul Ferrari back to the front of the Formula One grid.

The return of Raikkonen to Ferrari, pitching two world champions together in the same team, was expected to produce fireworks and results.

But there has been nothing sparkly about their relationship to date as the Finn has struggled for form, leaving Alonso to keep Ferrari in the hunt for podiums.

Alonso and Raikkonen did at least conjure their best results this season last time out in Hungary before the sport's summer break, finishing second and sixth.

Circumstances, however, dictated the result, which was no indicator as to a potential revival for the second half of the campaign which starts on Sunday with the Belgian Grand Prix.

Alonso and Raikkonen both know they have a lot of work to do if Ferrari are to show signs over the closing eight races they can again be a force to be reckoned with in 2015.

To that end, the duo are working hand in hand and Alonso said: 'We definitely work a lot together.

Plenty to ponder: Alonso has seen Ferrari struggle this season, with team-mate Raikkonen out of form

'The meetings have been quite long this year because we have had a lot of things to sort out after the races.

'We have been constantly making suggestions and comments about what we have on the track to try to help the engineers to transfer that to Maranello (factory) and to translate those comments into ideas for the car.

'It's not a big change compared to the way I used to work with Felipe (Massa) and any other team-mate.

'It's a working relationship to try to help the team all the time.'

Alonso has so far finished ahead of Raikkonen in all 11 races, and although he can point to longevity with the team as one reason behind such a statistic, the new regulations introduced at the start of the campaign should have provided more of a level playing field.

Raikkonen, though, has not found the car to his liking at all, with Alonso adding: 'Obviously the car is not great.

'We lack downforce and traction, and we had difficulties with braking at the first couple of races, and other systems, that we had new this year.

'Kimi was probably not feeling confident with the car and he was not totally happy with the balance, but at the moment neither of us are super happy with the performance.

'All we can do is to try to keep improving to score more points because, up until the last race and especially with the constructors' championship, we were going backwards a little bit.

'We now need to put both cars in the points as many times as possible.'
