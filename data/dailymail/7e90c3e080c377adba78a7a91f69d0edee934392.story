Locked up: Kenneth Mark Shirley 42, who has been handed another 16 life sentences on top of the seven he is already serving

A convicted murderer and rapist was told by a judge today that he will probably die in prison after being convicted of another knifepoint sex attack.

Mr Justice Astill handed Kenneth Mark Shirley another 16 life sentences on top of the seven he is already serving.

Shirley, 42, was found guilty of four rapes, 12 assaults by penetration and a single charge of wounding which took place between December 7 and 12, 2005, by a jury at Bristol Crown Court.

Shirley, 42, tied the woman to her bed, 
gagged her and repeatedly degraded with a knife and other objects during
a 12-hour assault.

The woman was left so traumatised by the attack in December 2005 that she did not tell police until last year.

Shirley, who is known by his middle name
of Mark, is already serving life imprisonment for the near-identical 
sex attack on Bristol woman Helen Stockford in 2009.

She gave up her anonymity in 2009, when he was convicted of raping her.

He was only free walking the streets 
because he had been released on licence from prison in 2003 after 
serving 16 years of a life sentence for the ritualistic murder of Mary 
Wainwright, 67, in Cardiff in 1987.

Jurors at Bristol Crown Court took around six hours to find Shirley unanimously guilty.

The judge said: 'Kenneth Mark Shirley, you must appreciate that the nature of these offences, and the murder and rape convictions that went before them, may well result - and probably should result - in you remaining in custody for the remainder of your life.'

Shirley, who was surrounded by four dock officers, showed no emotion and stared straight ahead as the jury foreman returned all 17 verdicts.

The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, sat in the upstairs public gallery of court room two to see the verdicts returned.

Sitting just a few feet away was Mrs Stockford, who has been present in the public gallery for the whole trial.

During Shirley’s trial at Bristol Crown Court, jurors were told of 'peculiar hallmarks' of his behaviour, which linked the murder and the 2009 rape to the offences for which he has now been convicted.

Prosecutors say it was 'beyond the realms of coincidence that a different man could have committed such similar offences in such a distinctive way'.

Scene: Shirley was told at Bristol Crown Court that he would probably die behind bars

William Mousley QC told the court that the woman was the victim of a 'brutal and prolonged sexual attack' at the hands of Shirley.

'She was repeatedly raped and otherwise violently assaulted over a period of hours whilst being held as a prisoner in her own home,' the prosecutor said.

'Many of the incidents occurred at knifepoint or when she had been tied up.'

Mr Mousley said the attack was 'devastating' for the woman and she has been forced to give up her career and admitted to a psychiatric unit.

Three weeks before the attack, the woman and her housemate had been out drinking in the Waterfront area of Bristol when they met a man called Mark.

The two women and the man chatted and the housemate told Mark that she would be away at a Christmas party for a few days in early December.

The alleged victim described in detail to Mark where she lived but the conversation turned sour later and she told him to 'f*** off' before leaving.

On the night of the attack, the woman heard a white van pull up outside her house.

She then heard footsteps and suddenly a well-built man in a black balaclava came in through an unlocked door.

'He pushed her backwards and she fell over on the kitchen floor. He knelt over her and banged her head against the tiled floor,' Mr Mousley said.

'He then grabbed her and dragged her backwards in the direction of the corridor saying ‘You can’t say no now’.

'He let go of her and seemed to be looking around the house. He then dragged her into the bedroom, having gone past the bathroom, swearing and menacing ‘You aint gonna say f****** no, you f****** bitch’ and ‘Wake up... you are going to be awake for this’.'

Mr Mousley said the woman tried to fight the man off but he pinned her down on the bedroom floor.

He then told her to get up and pushed her on to the bed.

The attacker removed his mask and as the woman remembered him from the pub three weeks earlier, he said: 'You recognise me now then... You’re going to suffer now.'

The man took regular breaks between assaults to make cups of tea or watch television.

Shirley said to her: 'I’m going to drink your blood and then you’ll always be inside me.'

Mr Mousley told jurors: 'He threatened to cut off her toe, finger or ear, saying he had chopped up a woman before.

'He traced the knife down her front and said he had taken someone’s eye out before. He told her that he would kill her slowly...'

Mr Mousley explained that similarities between these allegations and Shirley’s previous convictions meant the victim was not making it up.

'The prosecution say that these previous convictions and their relative timing demonstrate a clear pattern of repeated behaviour,' he said.

The woman first confided in a psychologist and finally gave a written statement to police in May 2011.

She later picked Shirley out at an identity parade.

In a defence statement, Shirley, who was living in Bristol, denied ever meeting the woman or raping her.

'He has suggested that she has imagined the attack as a result of her deteriorating health,' Mr Mousley said.

Heavily-tattooed Shirley offered no evidence as a defence to the allegations.
