Criminal gangs are increasingly targeting van drivers in ‘crash for cash’ scams, and have driven up personal injury claims by 51 per cent in a year, it has emerged.

Insurance giant Aviva said that the number of staged accidents it 
detected rose from 536 in 2012 to 820 last year.

Meanwhile, the number of individual fraudulent cash-for-crash claims rose 
from 1,417 to 2,200 over the same period – an increase of 55 per cent.

Now it has emerged that gangs are increasingly scouting for tradesmen on the roads believing they are too busy to challenge them and may not be fully insured, according to anti-fraud company APU.

Vans were involved in a third of all deliberate crashes last year. 

Scam: 'Crash for cash' criminals are increasingly targeting van drivers in 'crash for cash' scams believing they are too busy to debate who is to blame

Neil Thomas, APU's director of investigative services, said: 'Criminal fraud gangs are becoming more sophisticated - they are thinking quite hard about who they target.'

Innocent 
drivers who appear the most likely to be insured and the least likely to
 make a fuss are also falling victim, such as those with well-maintained
 cars, older drivers and families with young children.

Since 2011 cash-for-crash incidents have nearly doubled, rising from 447 incidents involving 1,273 fraudulent claims.

Aviva said it detected bogus cash-for cash claims worth £10million among the 
£59million of general motor insurance frauds, 'the highest levels we have ever detected'.

The scams now account for more than a third of all the 6,000 
fraudulent motor claims the insurance firm dealt with last year –  a 20 
per cent rise overall.

Central Buses axed a busy Birmingham route last month after falling victim to ‘crash for cash’ fraudsters 15 times in two years. The company received 15 insurance claims when just four people were involved

Usually, in accidents where one vehicle is hit from behind by another, it is the driver following who is deemed at fault. So, in a crash for cash incident, a car may brake suddenly in front of a chosen motorist, leaving them with little chance of avoiding a crash.

There have also been reports of criminals disconnecting their brake lights so the car they target has even less warning.

Other scams involve drivers flashing their lights at other motorists at junctions, only to then by struck by that vehicle.

Even the public transport system has been hit.

Central Buses axed a busy Birmingham route last month after falling victim to ‘crash for cash’ fraudsters 15 times in two years.

The company said the final straw came when it received 15 insurance claims from people saying they were passengers hurt in a collision that actually involved just four people – none of whom was injured.

A motorist travelling alone braked sharply in front of a single-decker bus.

Aviva – which insures one in 10 
vehicles on the road - say that the number of staged accidents it 
detected rose from 536 in 2012 to 820 last year – an increase of 51 per 
cent.

These resulted
 in the number of individual fraudulent cash-for-crash claims rising 
from 1,417 to 2,200 over the same period – an increase of 55 per cent, 
it said.

Since 2011 cash-for-crash incidents have nearly doubled, rising from 447 incidents involving 1,273 fraudulent claims.

Cash
 for crash scams now account for more than a third of all the 6,000 
fraudulent motor claims the insurance firm dealt with last year –  a 20 
per cent rise overall.

Aviva
 said it detected bogus cash-for cash claims worth £10million among the 
£59million of general motor insurance frauds which in turn now account 
for more than half of all insurance scams it uncovered.

Aviva said that overall in 2013 it 
detected more than £59m of motor injury fraud – more than any other form
 of insurance fraud.   

Last year it detected more than £110million worth of fraud, up 19 per cent on 2012.

Despite repairs to the bus and car costing only £500 each, the firm ended up paying out £25,000 fighting each claim in court.

Birmingham has become a crash for cash hotspot, with six of its postcodes among the ten UK districts where the crime is most likely.

In December, the charity Crimestoppers named Birmingham and Bradford as crash for cash capitals, based on insurance data.

The cities host nine of the ten districts where the crime is most likely. The final area is in Bolton.’

Tom Gardiner, head of claims fraud at Aviva, said: ‘The fast growth of induced accidents on our roads is cause for serious concern. Fraudsters are prepared to put the safety of innocent motorists and their families and passengers at risk for their own personal gain.

‘We believe that convictions for motor injury fraud resulting from induced accidents should result in more custodial sentences.

‘Stronger sentences will deter would-be fraudsters and help to keep roads safer and premiums lower for customers.’

Data from The Sentencing Council reveals that community orders were the most common sentence handed out for fraud offences since 2004. But the Aviva report says:

’We believe this does little to deter crash for cash fraudsters from committing – and re-committing – induced accidents.’

It notes: ‘Currently, even where a fraudster exaggerates his claim often by tens of thousands of pounds, he is still entitled to recover his original claim – and therefore there is little deterrent to discourage fraud.’

Consumer research shows two out of three respondents supported stronger sentences for convictions of motor injury fraud while almost 9 in 10 felt custodial sentences sent the strongest message.

Last month a report by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said the increase in staged crashes and false whiplash claims helped fuel an 18 per cent rise in insurance fraud last year that cost a record £1.3billion.

Nearly two thirds was paid out to motoring claimants. The ABI calculates such bogus claims cost each of us an extra £90 a year onto motor insurance.

The ABI report revealed a total of 118,500 bogus or exaggerated insurance claims were detected last year and almost half were for motoring claims.

It concluded: ‘Fraudulent motor insurance claims were the most expensive and common, with the number of dishonest claims at 59,900 – up 34 per cent on 2012 – and their value at £811million, up 32 per cent’.
