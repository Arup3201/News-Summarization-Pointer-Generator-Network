American Hustle and Gravity swept the board at this year's 2014 Oscar nominations, with 10 nods apiece.

The David O. Russell drama and Alfonso Cuarón space epic both received nominations in the Best Picture category, as well as nods for their leading men and women.

12 Years A Slave followed closely behind with nine nominations, including one for Best Picture - setting up an apparent three-horse race between three very different films.

Gravity star Sandra Bullock was named in 
the Best Actress category but will have strong competition from American
 Hustle's Amy Adams, while Christian Bale also got a Best Actor nod for 
his role in the film.

Leading the way: American Hustle received 10 nods in the 2014 Academy Award nominations

Competition: Gravity earned a nomination for Best Picture as well as a Best Actress nod for Sandra Bullock

Amy and Sandra will compete against 
Philomena's Judi Dench, Cate Blanchett for Blue Jasmine and Meryl Streep
 for August: Osage County.

Following the news, Meryl said she was
 'proud' that she and co-star Julia Roberts - who got a Best Supporting 
Actress nod - had received recognition.

'I
 am so happy for our film that Julia and I have been nominated,' she 
said in statement. 'We are both so proud of August: Osage County. This 
honor from the Academy, for which we are truly grateful, will help bring
 attention to our film from audiences across the country, which is 
thrilling.'

Record: Meryl Streep received a record 18th Oscar nomination, this time for best actress for her role in August: Osage County, pictured with Julia Roberts, who was nominated in the Best Supporting Actress category

And Judy, who won Best Supporting Actress in 1998 for Shakespeare In Love, said:

'This is just the loveliest news. I'm so 
happy for everybody involved, and so proud to have been part of the 
wonderful experience that Philomena has been,' Dench said in a statement
 following the announcement.

Christian has some tough competition from Leonardo DiCaprio for The Wolf Of Wall Street, Chiwetel Ejiofor
 for 12 Years A Slave and Matthew McConaughey for Dallas Buyers 
Club.

Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper both received Supporting Actress and Actor nominations respectively for American Hustle.

Hot contender: 12 Years A Slave, starring Lupita Nyong'o, Michael Fassbender and Chiwetel Ejiofor, won a Best Picture nomination as well as nods for all three leading actors

Long-awaited news: The nominations were announced by Chris Hemsworth and Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs at the AMPAS Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills

However,
 Jennifer - last year's Best Actress winner - will have a tough time winning 
for a second year running as the other nominees in her category are Sally Hawkins for Blue Jasmine, Julia 
Roberts for August: Osage County, June Squibb for Nebraska and Lupita 
Nyong'o for 12 Years A Slave.

In the Supporting Actor category, 
Bradley will have to face off against Michael Fassbender for 12 Years A 
Slave, Jonah Hill for The Wolf Of Wall Street, Jared Leto for Dallas
 Buyers Club and Barkhad Abdi for Captain Phillips.

Both
 American Hustle and Gravity are up against Captain Phillips, Dallas
 Buyers Club, Her, Nebraska, Philomena, 12 Years A Slave and The Wolf 
Of Wall Street in the Best Picture category.

Standout performers: Amy Adams and Christian Bale earned acting nominations for their roles as  Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser in American Hustle

In
 addition, American Hustle director O. Russell was nominated in the Best
 Director category alongside Cuarón, while Martin Scorsese received a 
nod for The Wolf Of Wall Street.

Nebraska director Alexander Payne and 12 Years A Slave's Steve McQueen round out the Best Director category.

Best Director nominee David O. Russell, said in a statement: '...we tried
 to create characters and a world that the audience would find romantic 
and moving and real.  I am so thrilled for my partners – my actors, my 
producers, Eric Singer, and the craftspeople from the film – who were 
honoured today.  They gave it their all; they poured their passion into 
the movie and I am truly thankful to them.'

The most notable omission by the academy was Tom Hanks, whose lead performance in Captain Phillips was widely considered a shoo-in.

Will he manage it? Leonardo DiCaprio earned a nomination for The Wolf Of Wall Street - will this be his year?

Robert Redford, expected by many to be nominated for the shipwreck 
drama All Is Lost, also missed out on a best actor nod. Redford has 
never won an acting Oscar.

Disney's
 making-of Mary Poppins tale Saving Mr. Banks also failed to land either
 a best picture nomination or a best actress nod for Emma Thompson as had been anticipated.

The
 nominations were announced from Beverly Hills, California by Academy 
President Cheryl Boone Isaacs and Thor actor Chris Hemsworth.

The Oscars will take place in Los Angeles on Sunday March 2nd.

Cool rider: Matthew McConaughey was given a Best Actor nod for Dallas Buyers Club
