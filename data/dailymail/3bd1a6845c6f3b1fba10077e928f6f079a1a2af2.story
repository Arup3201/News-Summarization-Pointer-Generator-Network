When Elsie Campbell began having cravings for lettuce, she thought it was a passing fancy.

Even when it became an obsession that saw her eating four whole lettuces a day, she still tried to shrug it off  as harmless.

Luckily for Mrs Campbell, her husband Jim, a research scientist, suspected there might be something more to it.

Jim Campbell realised his wife's sudden love of lettuce could be her body's way of signalling she was suffering from a more serious health problem

He worked out that lettuce contains a 
particular nutrient that is lacking in breast cancer sufferers and that 
his wife’s urge to eat so much of it could mean she was suffering from 
the disease.

After a visit to her doctor, the 
mother of three was diagnosed with breast cancer, but has now made a 
full recovery thanks to the early diagnosis. She credits her husband’s 
quick-thinking for saving her life.

‘I woke up one day and suddenly fancied some lettuce,’ said Mrs Campbell, a 59-year-old accounts assistant.

‘I’d always eaten it in salads, but 
suddenly, I just couldn’t get enough of it. I could eat three or four 
whole lettuces a day. I’d eat a whole iceberg lettuce at work, and sit 
on the bus on the way home thinking about eating more and more.

‘I’d get home and cut one into chunks and eat it like a watermelon.

‘I knew something wasn’t quite right – and my husband and my sons started to get quite worried about me.

‘Jim started investigating which 
nutrients and minerals were found in lettuce – and realised they  were 
the same ones that your body can be deprived of when it is fighting 
cancer.’

Mrs Campbell, from Derby, added: ‘Not 
long afterwards, I discovered a small dimple on my breast – and my 
doctor confirmed I had  breast cancer.

‘It’s only now that I realise my body 
was making me eat lettuce to combat the cancer. It was like my body was 
trying to cure itself.’ Mr Campbell has now created a website, 
questionmyhealth.com, that he says can help identify if users are 
suffering from a nutrient deficiency caused by something more serious.

The website asks users to answer a 
series of questions about themselves – such as whether they have white 
spots on their fingernails, whether they have a high libido, or whether 
they crave Marmite. It then analyses the answers and warns of any 
minerals or vitamins the user may be deficient in – and what that  could
 mean.

Elsie Campbell, 59, developed a sudden inexplicable craving for lettuce. Her husband realised she could be deficient in sulforaphane

The scientist, who has also written a 
book on nutrient deficiencies, hopes the site will help others spot 
potential diseases and cancers while they are still in the early stages.

Mr Campbell said: ‘Some chronic 
diseases, like diabetes and Alzheimer’s, can take 20 years to develop, 
but your body can give you a clue to what you are dealing with early on 
if you know what to look for.’

He added: ‘As a scientist, I know that
 everything has to have a cause and effect. Elsie didn’t start eating 
lettuce for no reason, so I started to do some research in which 
minerals and vitamins are found in it.

‘I discovered lettuce, like a lot of 
green veg, contains sulforaphane – which can attack cancer cells. I 
wondered if that was the reason why her body was craving it and 
suggested that Elsie visited the doctor.

‘Coincidentally, she discovered the 
small dimple on her breast the same day. We were devastated when the 
doctors told us she had cancer – but relieved that they managed to catch
 it so early.

‘Her lettuce cravings really were a 
warning sign – if she hadn’t suspected something was wrong, she would 
have probably never found the dimple, or certainly would not have been 
so concerned about it.’

Mrs Campbell, whose lettuce craving began in 2004, was diagnosed with breast cancer in early 2005.

She had the small lump removed from her breast and had months of treatment but has now been given the all-clear.

She added: ‘Strangely, since the lump 
was removed, I haven’t wanted to eat a single lettuce leaf – the 
craving’s completely vanished.

‘I was so lucky Jim spotted the signs when he did – my lettuce addiction probably saved my life.’
