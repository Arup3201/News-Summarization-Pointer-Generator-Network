Frail: Spinster Maria Morrison was stabbed repeatedly by David Walters

A devout Catholic forgave the brute who tried to murder her in a random knife attack today as he was warned he may never be freed.

Frail spinster Maria Morrison, 75, was stabbed repeatedly by 23-year old musclemen David Walters because he wanted to 'do some damage to someone' after 'losing face' over a tiff on Facebook.

She was waiting for a bus when Walters encountered her by pure chance and repeatedly plunged a 10in kitchen knife into her body screaming 'Die, Die! I'll Kill You.'

He then ran off - spitting onto the pavement as he left the scene.

Miraculously, despite being close to death Miss Morrison, a retired dressmaker got help by flagging down a passing car and waited with a neighbour as an ambulance went to the scene.

Whilst in hospital she was given a crucifix belonging to a Catholic policeman and she used it for spiritual comfort as she won an amazing battle for life.

Walters was caught after officers who watched CCTV of the attack went to the spot where he spat and took a DNA sample which matched his profile.

Today, Miss Morrison who was said to be in the wrong place at the wrong time relived her terrible ordeal as Walters, of Chorlton, Manchester, pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was given an indeterminate jail term.

After the case she said: 'My faith has kept me here. God has given me the strength in that terrible moment in my life - he said it wasn't my time.

'I know he is there, always. I still 
get very emotional. I was trying to push him away with my hands, trying 
to pushing him away. He seemed much bigger and stronger than me.

'I
remember my leg was shivering. I was just holding the knife, but I 
didn't know if I was actually pushing it away - something gave me the 
strength to do something. I thought I was going, but my guardian angel 
must have been there to help me.'

She added: 'God forgives everyone, so I have got to forgive him. I was so angry, but I forgive him. God will hopefully let him do better.

'I have no idea why he attacked me - it was mad whatever happened to him. It was a moment of madness and he wanted to do damage. But I was so confused at the time - I didn't know what was going on.'

'I don't have any family, so I must 
cope the best I can. I cannot do the things I used to enjoy doing 
because of the injury to my hand - like painting, sewing and knitting. 
It's affected me a lot.'

'I get better day by day - I'm a strong person and know I have to do it.'

Manchester
Crown Court was told the attack occurred on December 29 last year after
Walters posted a number of threatening messages on Facebook about his 
girlfriend being 'poked' by his cousin on the social networking site.

He sent a message to his girlfriend saying: 'Now I've lost you I aint got nowt to lose.'

After the case Detective Inspector Lee Price, of 
Greater Manchester Police, said: 'For every Walters in this world there 
are a multitude of people who restore your faith in human nature.

'Maria showed immense courage to 
fight him off in the first place and remarkable strength to make such a 
good recovery. What happened to her that day would have broken many 
people, but she has come through it.'

PC Simon Coates who comforted Maria 
after the attack and gave her his crucifix said: 'Maria had become 
really distressed having to deal with the after-effects of the incident.

'It became apparent she was very 
religious and she had asked for a priest to speak with her. I carry a 
crucifix on me and I happily gave it to her.

'It was a reassurance to her - she 
said it made her feel better. She wrapped it around her hand and I think
it was something she clinged on to.

'She was the perfect person for this 
to happen to - because she is uber strong. I have come across some 
people that are unable to cope. The way she's dealt with it is 
phenomenal.'

He
also made several threatening phone calls to various members of his own
family, in which he threatened to stab and kill his cousin - and then 
armed himself with the blade and went out on a rampage.

Miss Morrison
who attends St Bernadette's Church in Withington where her artwork and 
embroidery adorn the walls was sitting on a bench at a bus stop outside 
Southern Cemetery when Walters stormed up to her.

She
said: 'I wasn't supposed to go out that day, I had just planned to 
rest, but my TV broke the day before so I wanted to get someone to fix 
it.

'I sat at the bus stop 
and I saw the man who looked very angry. He was waving the knife around 
and came towards me. When I saw the blade I put my hand up to protect my
face.

'I thought it was the
end, he kept screaming â€˜die, die, die', it happened so quick - within 
two minutes. The pain, I didn't even think of it, you don't when you 
have to defend yourself.

'I 
was just thinking how I could get away from him. When he pushed me 
against a fence, I thought that was the end of it.

'I closed my eyes and 
tried to kick him and I grabbed his sleeve to push him back. I felt a 
strength I didn't know I had. I pushed the knife away from my neck.'

Miss Morrison
managed to struggle to her feet, moved her arms up to defend herself 
and kicked out at Walters while shouting for help. He made several 
attempts to stab her in the head, but she managed to dodge out of the 
way. He eventually ran off.

In shock and bleeding heavily from multiple stab wounds, Miss Morrison
managed to stop a passing car and the police and ambulance were called.
She suffered numerous puncture wounds on her body and deep cuts to her 
hand and spent nine days in hospital.

Walters
was arrested the day after the attack. He had an extensive criminal 
record which included robbery and assault. He must serve a minimum of 
seven years in jail before he can be considered for release.

Passing
sentence Judge Andrew Gilbart QC told him: 'There is a significant and 
indeed substantial risk of further offending which could cause serious 
harm to members of the public.

'I find myself unable to say when it will 
be that you are safe for release.

'Your
head was filled with your obsessive jealousy and you chose to set upon 
this entirely innocent lady. You saw her in some way as someone who was 
responsible and you carried out a frenzied attack.

'This court pays tribute to her and the spirit displayed by a very brave woman.'
