Twitter and politics rarely meet the equation for romance.

But in one surprise proposal that borrowed the Twitter feed of Virginia Senator Mark Warner to get the attention of his press secretary, Beth Adelson, it summed up to just that.

Brett_Wanamaker: 'Senator, your Press Secretary pays more attention to this feed than her own - can I borrow this space for a minute?' Brett Wanamaker Tweeted to Mr Warner on Thursday.

Excitement: Brett Wanamaker takes a knee and pulls out a ring before his girlfriend Beth Adelson in the hall as she tries covering her face but easily shows her excited reaction behind

Little help: Requesting the help of Virginia Senator Mark Warner, Mr Wanamaker did his best to reach out to Ms Adelson, the senator's press secretary, for a surprise proposal seen here

Without a moment's hesitation, he got a reply back.

'Certainly. Best of luck!’

'Beth Ellen Adelson,' Mr Wanamaker Tweeted on the senator's wall while including her handle to better alert her to his next four words, 'will you marry me?'

Shocked, Ms Adelson's initial response showed two words more than the one possibly expected.

'What is happening,' she tweeted.

Fortunately for Mr Wanamaker, the following photos Tweeted by a friend clued everyone in on what her answer really was.

Surprise: Mr Wanamaker stands before his girlfriend who appears entirely blown away by his surprise Tweet and appearance before her while holding flowers and a ring

Seen in one photo, greeting Ms Adelson at the entrance of an office, Mr Wanamaker - who's a recent graduate at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine - stands before her in the hallway holding a bouquet of flowers and a gold box in his right hand.

Reacting, Ms Adelson's blonde hair and green jacket are captured blown behind her as she uses both hands to cover her mouth at his surprise appearance.

He gets down on one knee, with Ms Adelson falling to the ground to do the same, and he pulls out the ring to equally large smiles from both.

Happy ending: The trio later posed for pictures together, Mr Warner seen on the left of the happy couple moments after she accepted his proposal and ring, seen flashing on her finger

'She said yes! Congratulations!' the senator later tweeted on his wall.

The trio later posed for pictures together, Ms Adelson seen holding up her ring on her left hand still appearing shell-shocked from the emotional whirlwind now forever recorded thanks to social media.

‘It is very surreal,’ she later Tweeted a friend on her wall.
