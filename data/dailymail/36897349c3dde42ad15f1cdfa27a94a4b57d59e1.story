An angry Jetstar passenger says he was forced to sit beside a drunk man who touched his girlfriend 'sexually'  before masturbating to porn on his computer mid-flight.

Nathan Paterson, 29, was travelling from Narita, Japan to the Gold Coast on board a Jetstar flight with his girlfriend on December 6 when the incident unfolded, news.com.au reports.

The trouble started four hours into the flight when Mr Paterson's girlfriend told him the drunk Japanese man next to them was touching her in a 'sexual manner'.

'(He) felt her twice down the right side of her body from her shoulder down past her buttocks and thigh,' Mr Patterson said.

The 50-year-old man repeatedly apologised after being confronted and Mr Paterson said that's when he noticed he smelt of alcohol and had a stash of bottles filled with vodka.

Flight attendants were notified and the alcohol was confiscated, but Mr Patterson said the man was quick to grab another bottle of vodka from the overhead locker. 

'The man then started to make me feel very uncomfortable by staring at me and talking to me in an aggressive nature in Japanese,' he said.

Cabin crew confiscated the second bottle of alcohol and the man reportedly became aggressive. 

He then got out his laptop and a pornographic magazine before pulling his pants down to masturbate on and off for three hours.

Mr Paterson said he didn't notify the flight attendants as he was concerned about everyone's safety, but claims staff noticed and didn't act. 

The couple reported the man to Australian Federal Police when they landed and he was charged with offensive and disorderly behaviour on an aircraft and was fined $2,125.

They put in a complaint to Jetstar after the incident saying attendants didn't ask if they wanted to move or apologise for the passenger's behaviour. 

Jetstar said they had investigated and placed the man on their no fly list, which means he can't take a Jetstar or Qantas flight in future. 

'Clearly this was a distressing incident and we regret that one of our passengers was subjected to the deplorable behaviour of another passenger on-board,' a spokesperson said.
