Current QPR first-team coach and former England manager Glenn Hoddle looks ahead to the crunch Premier League match between bitter rivals Manchester United and Liverpool.

Third-placed United go into the game looking for their sixth consecutive win in the league, while the visitors will be hoping to turnaround their poor start to the season with victory at Old Trafford.

In last season's corresponding fixture at the Theatre of Dreams, Liverpool cruised to a 3-0 victory.

Sportsmail columnist Hoddle  expects the match to have a different outcome though this time around.

LIVERPOOL'S MISSING STRIKERS  

Liverpool’s most glaring problem is their lack of goals. Hardly surprising when you lose both Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. This time last year Liverpool had already scored 30 Premier League goals. This season they have scored only 19. Of the 101 goals they scored last season, 53 came from those two and another 12 from Steven Gerrard. 

You have to have some sympathy for Brendan Rodgers. He might have expected to lose Suarez but could never have expected to cope for this part of the season without both of them. Last season I saw some games where they were scintillating. At other times they were average but Suarez got them the points.

After 15 games last season Liverpool had 30 points, eight more than United. Now United (28) are seven clear.

Both sides have made 16 changes to their defences this season. United have used 11 players, Liverpool 9.

LIVERPOOL’S TACTICAL PROBLEMS 

Liverpool just can’t replicate the style they had last season. It’s not just that the strikers they signed, Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli, haven’t fitted in and scored goals, they don’t offer the same qualities off the ball as Suarez and Sturridge. 

Last season, Liverpool came at teams in a frenzy of attacking football, especially at Anfield, and would often sweep them away in the first 20 minutes. It was this time last year when they started playing like that, with a 5-1 win against Norwich and a 4-1 win over West Ham, both at Anfield in December 2013 and then, on this weekend last year, a 5-0 win at Tottenham which made everyone sit up and take notice. This fixture last season at Old Trafford was a great example of their best form - a 3-0 win after they were 2-0 up very early in the second half. 

Suarez and Sturridge had energy and pace but Lambert and Balotelli are much more static. They don’t run into the same areas to stretch teams. Liverpool are not just missing the goals, the style of play that had been so effective isn’t working at the moment. 

Liverpool have had to adapt to a different style of play upfront with the summer signing of Rickie Lambert

LIVERPOOL’S STAGNANT MIDFIELD

Because of their lack of goals, Gerrard has been playing much further up the pitch. That means they’ve lost their best distributor of the ball from deep. Jordan Henderson, Lucas and Joe Allen haven’t been hitting the same heights this season either. They’re struggling with their distribution - they don’t have a quick enough picture in their minds of how the game is unfolding. Previously, they would have Gerrard supporting them and Sturridge and Suarez as well as Raheem Sterling giving them plenty of options.

MUDDLED UP DEFENDING

It's interesting that Liverpool had conceded 18 goals this time last year - this season it’s 19 - but neither side can get a settled defence. Liverpool have fielded the same back four on only three occasions this season and the last time they named an unchanged side was against Chelsea back in April.

Incredibly, United haven’t named an unchanged side since November 2012. In defence they have switched between a back three and a back four and have only been able to go with the same personnel and formation on four occasions. Liverpool are still finding their way. New signing Dejan Lovren is struggling while Alberto Moreno isn’t picked every week. United are decimated by injuries, at various times losing Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Rafael, Jesse Lingaard and Paddy McNair.

UNITED’S VULNERABILITY 

My specific concern is Ashley Young playing at left back or wing back. They got away with it at Southampton. When Shane Long got on the back post at 52 minutes on Monday, he should have made it 2-1 and that would have been a decisive moment. It was waiting to happen and had been clearly signposted. Young finds it very difficult to defend in those situations. 

Louis van Gaal has a problem on Sunday: does he stick with a back three, putting Michael Carrick in there and leaving himself vulnerable on the flanks? Young will probably be up against Sterling! I would prefer a back four with Rojo at left back but that would mean they have Evans and McNair at centre half, one of whom has only just come back from injury and the other who will be low on confidence after being taken off early against Southampton.

LUCKY MANAGERS 

Graham Taylor once talked about how Napoleon had said he preferred lucky generals over clever ones. I think Van Gaal will realise that he’s been fortunate so far in his Premier League season to be in third place having played so poorly. But having got the team into that position he must now feel confident. He knows he has players coming back, he will have a stronger defence in the second half of the season and Manchester United are likely to get better.

Despite a never-ending crippling injury list, United boss Louis van Gaal has guided his side to third in the table

THE VERDICT 

Both sides are playing poorly and both are defensively weak. When the tactical systems aren’t working well, it tends to come down to the quality of the individuals, and that’s why I feel this game has come at the right time for United. 

If United beat Liverpool on Sunday it will be their sixth consecutive win in the Premier League this season

With Robin van Persie coming into form and Wayne Rooney on the pitch, they have more experienced players of quality than Liverpool. And they have the momentum of five consecutive wins, however, scratchy they were. Liverpool are in a trough, confidence is low. At Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon, it’s hard to see beyond a United win.
