Watford have appointed former Brighton boss Oscar Garcia as their new head coach.

The Hornets moved quickly to appoint the 41-year-old following the resignation of Beppe Sannino on Sunday.

Garcia spent a season at the Seagulls before departing in May, leading them to the Championship play-offs.

Impressive: Garcia led Brighton to the Championship play-offs last season

In the summer he returned to former side Maccabi Tel Aviv, but due to security concerns in Israel he resigned last week.

However, it has not taken him long to make his return to the game, as he looks to build on the success he achieved at the Amex last season.

He also reportedly turned down the manager's job at Leeds to become the new Hornets boss. 

Shortlived: Garcia left Maccabi Tel Aviv due to the current security situation in Israel

A club statement read: 'Watford Football Club is delighted to confirm the appointment of Oscar Garcia as Head Coach, the Hornets having won the race against several high-profile English clubs to secure his services.

'Oscar's recent Championship experience, taking Brighton & Hove Albion into last season's Championship promotion play-offs, was a key factor in his appointment.'

Watford sit second in the Championship following a impressive start to the season, with 12 points out of a possible 15, with Garcia's former employers sitting firmly poised in mid-table with seven points from their first five games.
