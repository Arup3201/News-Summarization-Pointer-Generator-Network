A former X Factor contestant has been accused of driving a bandmate’s car before running into a pedestrian.

Paige Flaherty, 18, who appeared on the show last year as part of girl band Twisted, allegedly took a pink Mini belonging to Katie Orrock before driving it to Newcastle where she collided with a man at a pelican crossing in South Shields.

The teenager from Jarrow in Tyne and 
Wear is facing charges of aggravated taking of a vehicle without consent
and driving without insurance.

Faced court: Paige Flaherty, right, allegedly drove X Factor bandmate Katie Orrock's, left, pink mini without consent before colliding with a pedestrian in Newcastle

Prosecutor Jeanette Smith told South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court yesterday that the person who collided with the pedestrian gave him false details after the accident.

Flaherty pleaded not guilty and magistrates passed the case to Newcastle Crown Court where she will appear before magistrates again on November 7. She was granted unconditional bail until then.

Made headlines: The group made headlines when fellow bandmate Chrissie 
Pitt, right, was told by judge Kelly Rowland, left, to continue on solo in the 
competition

The band made headlines last year after X
Factor judge Kelly Rowland told band member Chrissie Pitt, from South 
Shields, to ditch the rest of the band and continue as a solo artist.

Miss Pitt took Rowland’s advice, continuing on in the competition as a solo artist without the girl group.

She only made it to the boot camp stage before being kicked off after singing One Love in September last year.

The other members, including Flaherty, Miss Orrock and Cheryl Moody denied rumours that they were bitter about Miss Pitt’s decision to leave them behind in the TV talent show. 

Earlier this year the remaining trio made a comeback as KISSABEAT in Sky’s Starz TV competition.

The band won the contest which saw the group record their own song ‘Just Jealousy’ but when it was released Flaherty’s vocals were erased from the final version.

Bitter rumours: The three remaining band members were rumoured to be bitter about Ms Pitt's decision to continue on solo in the competition and the trio made a comeback, winning Sky's Starz TV competition
