They have featured in some of the world's most famous films.

But despite forging some of Hollywood's most iconic images, these pictures show the sorry state of abandoned spaghetti western sets long since forgotten.

Nestled in Spain's hostile Tabernas Desert, Almeria, lies these abandoned towns and buildings.

Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Clef and Henry 
Fonda starred in legendary cowboy pictures The Good, The Bad and The 
Ugly, Once Upon A Time in the West and For A Few More Dollars which were all filmed on site.

But despite more than 200 titles being captured in the desert during the 1960s and 70s, the area was disbanded and left behind as spaghetti western's popularity faded.

The three main studios that once bustled with Hollywood's biggest names are now ghost towns that cater for a few tourists, and are surrounded by desolate buildings used in the films.

 uncovered dozens of neglected settings that have been slowly reclaimed 
by the harsh Spanish desert.

Ms Orndhorf, of Germany, said: 'Despite the soaring heat and remote locations it is an area filled with history and character - this was once Hollywood's hotbed.

'The buildings were thrown up for big-budget films that shadowed anything else being made at the time, but they were thrown to one side and became a distant memory.

'But they're beautiful and iconic, and just walking through them you can get a feel for the old films - they still have a strong presence.'

Empty: Dozens of neglected buildings have been slowly reclaimed by the harsh Spanish desert

Varied: The site is filled with deteriorating shacks and Texas towns on one side, as Mexican pueblos crumble just yards away

Legendary: Clint Eastwood rides a horse through the town for the film 'For a Few Dollars More'

The area is filled with deteriorating shacks and Texas towns on one side, as Mexican pueblos crumble just yards away.

The eerie streets have been thrown back to the sands of time and high noon shootouts are a distant echo.

But trickles of tourists arrive eagerly each week to enjoy the loved settings.

Ms Orndhorf added: 'Sightseers are shown round a few streets that are maintained, but just round the corner are masses of decaying structures.

'It's a shame because they're were the beating heart of 60s and 70s, but time moves and on and at least they can be enjoyed by the odd person for a while.'
