So, how on earth is he going to get himself out of this situation?

A 23-year-old unemployed man with a superhero name has been jailed for nearly three years for theft, trespassing and drug use.

Batman bin Suparman was caught on CCTV breaking into a snooker hall at the Depot Heights Shopping Centre in Singapore on two separate occasions and stealing S$500 (£250) in total.

He pleaded guilty to various charges, including stealing his brother’s bank card to make withdrawals totalling S$650 (£325), and taking heroin. Batman was sent to prison for a total of 33 months.

Batman - who was arrested on August 19 and jailed yesterday - became a social media sensation when an image of his oddly-named identity card, listing a date of birth of May 13, 1990, went viral.

News of the theft - which took place at a snooker hall called Games Fusion Billards at the mall on Depot Road - was first reported by the likes of Agence France-Presse and Channel News Asia.

A Facebook fan page called ‘Batman bin Suparman Fan Club’ has gathered more than 11,000 likes. One post by a user suggested he 'legally changed his name to be a misspelled DC character hybrid'.

Other users on the website said he could use his time in jail to 'catch up on all your comic book reading', while another said: 'He's only in jail for training, like at the beginning of Batman Begins'.

And Kevin Yang said: 'Our idol has been jailed! Someone break him out of prison!'

An article on Slate claimed the surname 'Suparman' is actually common among part of the Javanese population, and comes from the prefix of 'Su-', derived from a root meaning 'good and fortunate'.

The writer added that the surname is often seen in parts of Asia, with a former Indonesian military commander named 
Djadja Suparman and a Sundanese musician called Ade 
Suparman.

Batman, 
however, is not a common name - and the author hints that the man's 
name, which literally translates as 'Batman, son of Suparman', could even have been a 'wry joke' by his parents.

Reports claimed Batman pleaded guilty to several offences within the charges of six counts of theft, two counts of trespassing, and one count of heroin consumption – and only three went to trial.

They were the break-ins at the billiards hall - and the theft of the debit card belonging to his older brother, who is named Nurazman Suparman, according to Gawker.
