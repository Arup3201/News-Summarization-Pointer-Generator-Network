Busted: Leo Sharp was a drug courier and known as 'grandad' to the Sinaloa cartel

He was the 90-year-old Second World War veteran and one of America's foremost experts of day-lily flowers.

So how did Leo Sharp become the oldest drug mule in the U.S. after he was caught with 230lb of a Mexican cartel's cocaine? 

In a feature for the New York Times Sam Donick tells the story of Tata, or grandfather, who has gone down as a Detroit urban legend.

Sharp, from Michigan City, Indiana, carried thousands of pounds of cocaine for the Sinaloa cartel over a period of 10 years.

Special Agent Jeremy Fitch, one of the DEA agents who worked on the case which eventually caught Sharp, said: 'Leo is the perfect courier for the cartel.

'He has a legitimate ID, he’s an older guy, he wouldn’t be pegged as a drug runner and he has no criminal history.'

Florist Sharp attended flower conventions across the country 'dressed in either an all-white leisure suit or an all-black one', Dolnick writes.

'He traveled with an entourage of Mexican farmhands to help with the hundreds of flowers he would give away, making his admirers swoon.'

However, he also led another life as one of Sinaloa's most trusted couriers.

In 2010 alone, the great-grandfather is thought to have made more than $1million serving as a conduit for what was believed to be the biggest cocaine operation authorities in Detroit had ever seen.

He was eventually arrested in October 2011 following a routine traffic stop.

When
 the trooper asked Sharp if he could search the truck, Sharp refused. So
 the officer requested a backup unit with a dog trained to detect bombs 
and illegal drugs.

As the animal walked around the rear of Sharp's truck, it alerted to the possible presence of narcotics, the complaint said.

During
 a subsequent search of the truck bed, troopers found 104 bricks of 
cocaine stashed in five bags with a wholesale value of $2.9million.

The
 married father-of-three made a highly amusing appearance at the court 
hearing, telling the judge he lost his hearing after a cannon fired 
close to him during the 'war'.

Jailed: Leo Sharp is America's oldest drug mule after he was caught with 230lb of a Mexican cartel's cocaine

When he was told he would have to take a drug test, he said: 'I've never used a drug in my life. Ever.'

Sharp was charged with conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute cocaine.

One question which hung over the case was whether Sharp was fully aware of what he was doing or whether he was senile.

His attorney filed an 18-page 
sentencing memo hoping to persuade a judge that home confinement would 
be appropriate for the Michigan City, Indiana resident.

'He is a colorful, self-made, charitable man who has worked hard throughout this entire admirable, extraordinary, and long life,' Darryl Goldberg wrote.

'Mr.
 Sharp made a monumental mistake at a moment of perceived financial 
weakness, and was exploited and threatened, but his conduct in this case
 was truly an aberration from a law-abiding life.'

The government said it had evidence that Sharp was transporting marijuana and cocaine from the West Coast back in 2000.

Leo Sharp was found guilty of transporting cocaine across America for a notorious Mexican drug cartel

'Mr. Sharp is dreadfully sorry,' Goldberg said.

In
 preparation for the sentencing hearing, Sharp told court officials that
 he needed money.

Couriers were normally paid $1,000 per kilo so Sharp would have made $104,000 on the trip when he was arrested in 2011.

However, Sharp also said he was threatened when he tried to stop 
transporting drugs.

Joaquin Guzman, also known as El Chapo or Shorty, was arrested in February

He was diagnosed with dementia and other health problems and would be an 
expensive burden on the government if sent to prison, Goldberg said.

He is a World War II veteran who fought in Italy and was awarded the Bronze Star, the fourth-highest honor, for his service, Goldberg said.

Despite never divulging his relationship with the cartel or how he managed to evade detection he did help investigators.

A note found in his car led police to Viejo, Sharp's handler.

Four months after Sharpe's arrest, police raided 10 locations making 19 charges. All but two have since pleaded guilty.

The street price of cocaine per kilogram has also increased from about $30,000 to $43,000.

Despite facing 20 years in prison, prosecutors recommended he serve five because of his ageSharpe's lawyer also described him as a Second World War veteran who deserved mercy saying: 'That's not how we honour our heroes.'

Sharp was eventually sentenced to three years in federal prison.

Chapo Guzman, the head of the entire Sinaloa cartel, was one of the most wanted fugitives in the world.

He was arrested in February in an unrelated investigation.

Despite his arrest and the sentencing of other members of the Sinaloa, experts believe the cartel will continue.
