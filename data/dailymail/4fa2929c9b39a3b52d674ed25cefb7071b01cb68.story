'He has been a valuable member of this squad since he returned from Australia, and this season in particular, he has shown that he has a lot to add to this group both on and off the field.

'Unfortunately, a shoulder injury ended his season early, but he is working hard to get back out on the field and we are looking forward to having him back playing.'

Jacobs becomes the latest Wasps player to agree a contract extension, following the likes of James Haskell, Joe Launchbury, Ashley Johnson and Carlo Festuccia.
