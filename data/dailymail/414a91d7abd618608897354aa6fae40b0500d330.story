These are the first pictures of Heston Blumenthal’s two senior chefs killed in a horrific road accident during a promotional tour in Hong Kong.

Carl Lindgren, 30, from Sweden, was one of two staff employed at the Michelin-starred Fat 
Duck restaurant, who died after a double decker bus ploughed into the taxi 
in which they were travelling.

Reports last night claimed Mr Blumenthal had been in Hong Kong and was travelling in a separate cab at the time of the crash that also claimed the life of Briton Ivan Jorge, 34.

The accident happened after the driver
of the bus apparently fell unconscious for ten seconds and careered 
down a hill before hitting two cars, the taxi and another bus.

The
chef victims were named locally as Mr Jorge and Mr 
Lindgren.

They died alongside their driver Wong Kim-Chung, 53, after 
their taxi was crushed between the two buses.

They
were trapped in the cab for more than an hour before firemen could free
them from the wreckage.

They were later declared dead at the hospital.

A further 56 people, including a seven-month old child, were injured in the pile up on Monday.

The chefs had been in Hong Kong with Jonny Lake, the head chef of The Fat Duck, to promote a new Blumenthal 
restaurant.

Mr Lake had tweeted a picture of Mr Jorge and Mr Lindgren 
along with another chef preparing a special dinner at the Mandarin 
Oriental Hong Kong on Saturday night.

The
Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, last night refused to confirm the identity
of the men but said they were senior members of staff and described 
them as ‘uniquely talented young chefs’.

A spokesman said: ‘They were both great and dear friends…loved by everyone who worked with them.’

He added: 'Heston is in Hong Kong and will soon be on his way to Australia before making his way back home.'

Self-taught
chef Mr Blumenthal, 46, who has a £1million, two-year deal with Channel
4, has become renowned for his adventures in so-called molecular 
gastronomy.

He launched the Fat Duck in 1995 after buying a 450-year-old pub, The Ringers in Bray. The past few years have seen him expand his business into London. He also stars in adverts for Waitrose.

A source close to the Mandarin Hotel said: ‘Heston had been out in Hong Kong on a promotional tour for the hotel.

'It is pure chance that he was not involved in the accident. His two chefs got into one cab and he got into another soon after.’

Mr Blumenthal was due to appear at a Gourmet Escape event in Western Australia this weekend but organisers expect him to pull out.

The Fat Duck was open as usual last 
night. A total of 46 chefs are believed to work in the kitchen. A 
restaurant spokesman said: ‘The entire team, as you may imagine, are 
devastated.’

Chef Raymond 
Blanc offered his support to those at the Fat Duck via his Twitter 
account. He wrote: ‘My heart and my thoughts are with the families of 
the 2 young chefs from the Fat Duck & with Heston & the whole 
team at this tragic time.’

Heston's son Jack, himself an aspiring chef, tweeted: '2 chefs from the Fat Duck killed in a car crash in Hong Kong :/ My Best goes out to the friends and family and everyone at the Duck.'

He added: 'So tragic RIP'

Scottish chef Neil Rankin tweeted his followers: 'Tragic news. A waste of great talent. Condolences to the fat duck team.'

A former Fat Duck chef, Ben Godwin, also tweeted: 'RIP.......Legends!' in honour of the tragic pair.

Hong Kong police said the bus driver was arrested for causing death by dangerous driving and he has been released on bail.

Last night, a Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said that the family of the British chef, thought to have been Ivan Aranto Herrera Jorge, was being supported by consular officials.

'We can confirm the death of a British National who was involved in a road traffic accident in Hong Kong on 19 November,' the spokesman said.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
