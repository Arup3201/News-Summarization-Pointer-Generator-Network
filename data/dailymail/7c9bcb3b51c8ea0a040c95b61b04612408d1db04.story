A 20-year-old soldier who was struggling to come to terms with the deaths of five comrades in an explosion in Afghanistan took his own life when he was on home leave, an inquest heard yesterday.

Rifleman Allan Arnold was found hanged outside in his home town of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, with a note discovered on his body apologising to his mother and saying he could not cope anymore.

But his mother and sister refused to believe it was his handwriting after the May 2011 death - saying he was dyslexic and his writing was very distinctive, Gloucester Coroner’s Court heard.

Tragic: Rifleman Allan Arnold was found hanged outside in his home town of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, with a note was found on his body apologising to his mother and saying he could not cope anymore

He was serving with 2 Rifles based at Ballykinler barracks in Northern Ireland. It was the last day of his leave and he had spent the previous night drinking heavily with friends, the inquest was told.

Gloucestershire Assistant Deputy Coroner Katy Skerrett ruled that despite the family’s doubts, Rifleman Arnold wrote the note - but she was not sure whether he intended to take his own life.

His close friend Andy Higgins said that at the time of his death he had been ‘unable to cope’ with the loss of so many of his friends in Afghanistan after an improvised explosive device detonated.

Shortly before his death, Rifleman Arnold had told a physiotherapist who was treating him for a shoulder injury that he was having trouble coming to terms with the deaths of the five friends.

Corporal Jonathan Horne and Riflemen William Aldridge, James Backhouse, Joseph Murphy and Daniel Simpson were all killed in the roadside blast in Sangin, Afghanistan, in July 2009.

The evening before he died, Rifleman Arnold had been out drinking with serving soldier and friend Michael Greenacre. They met by chance and then stayed together drinking into the early hours.

‘He was his normal self,’ Mr Greenacre said. ‘He was happy and chirpy. He seemed happy to be going back to his regiment. We were both semi-drunk by the early hours. After we got some food we went to Allan’s sister’s. Drugs were being taken there and I saw him take some.’

'We hadn’t always got on, but he said he wanted to forget all that had happened. He went to all the people I was with and spoke to them. It was like he wanted to make peace with everyone'

Jordan Baker, friend

They walked back to where he was staying at about 3am and Allan left about 15 minutes later to go back to his mother’s house, he said.

‘He said he would probably see me the next day before he left,’ Mr Greenacre added.

Friend Jordan Baker spoke of how he had seen Allan the weekend before his death.

He said: ‘We hadn’t always got on, but he said he wanted to forget all that had happened. He went to all the people I was with and spoke to them. It was like he wanted to make peace with everyone.’

Many of the young soldier’s comrades and officers gave evidence and most said he had not appeared any different in the weeks before his death.

But his platoon commander Lieutenant James Amoore said the Rifleman had undergone treatment with the army mental health team following a previous tour in Afghanistan, which had been a particularly difficult time.

‘He was struggling to come to terms with it but this was not in any way unusual,’ he said.

‘He was coping as well as anyone in his position could be expected to cope. He seemed happy when he stopped seeing the team and it was his choice to stop receiving help.’

He said Rifleman Arnold had suffered a shoulder injury not long before his death and if this had not healed he knew he would not be able to serve with his platoon when he went back to Afghanistan and would be given a job on one of the main bases.

‘This really knocked him because he would not be going out with the rest of his platoon,’ he said, adding that he had also recently failed a course for an intelligence role because of his dyslexia.

Summing up, Coroner Skerrett said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death and there were two possible verdicts she could record - suicide or an open verdict.

‘I have to be sure he intended to take his own life if I decide to record a verdict of suicide and to be able to rule out all other possible explanations,’ she said.

He had been through a handwriting course while in the army and his handwriting had improved, she said, so she was satisfied the note had been written by him.

'He would have bent over backwards to give you the shirt off his back'

Abigail Smith, sister

He was under the influence of alcohol and drugs and had experienced a very traumatic tour of duty in Afghanistan and this was still playing on his mind, Coroner Skerrett said.

She added: ‘Failing the intelligence course would also have been a huge disappointment to him but against all this is the evidence that he was his usual happy self.’

Coroner Skerrett said the decision to hang himself could have been taken on the spur of the moment and she could not be sure he had a fixed intention to kill himself. She recorded an open verdict.

After the inquest, his sister Abigail Smith said he was a man loved by all his friends and family. ‘He would have bent over backwards to give you the shirt off his back,’ she added.
