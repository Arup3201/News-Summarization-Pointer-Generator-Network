Murder mystery: The head of a crocodile was washed up on a South African beach, leading to speculation over the identity of the killer

Washed up: The crocodile was found by local Brigitte Cary-Smith and her husband Neale. The couple filmed their find and posted the video on the internet

Hell hath no fury like an angry shark: Did a great white like this sever the head of a crocodile?

But the couple, from St Lucia, South Africa, are in no doubt - the culprit could only have been a great white shark.

In the footage Neale can be heard saying: 'You can see where the shark has actually ripped it.

'On the side here in the flesh you can see the shark teeth.

Gruesome discovery: Locals believe the crocodile's head was ripped off by a great white shark, although some say poachers are responsible

Who done it? Other locals think a hippo could have been the culprit, although the couple insist only a Great White shark could have severed the head so cleanly

'It’s quite normal for sharks to swim here in the sea at St Lucia and it’s also very normal for very large sharks to be very close to the shore.'

The couple, who live nearby and walk their dogs on the beach every morning at sunrise, say the cleanly severed head points to a great white.

And they say poachers are not the suspects as the head and jaw are thought of as the most valuable part of the three metre-long animal.

Poached? Apparently not, according to locals, who say the head and jaw are the most valuable part of the animal
