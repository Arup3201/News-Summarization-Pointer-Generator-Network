An RAF helicopter was last night scrambled to rescue a shivering 41-year-old woman and boy of 17 who were stranded up Mount Snowdon.

The Sea King helicopter flew out from Valley, Anglesey, and, along with members of the Llanberis mountain rescue team, went to their aid after the pair were found by another walker stranded on ice and snow more than 3,000ft up.

Low cloud prevented the Sea King from reaching them, but the mountain rescue team brought the walkers down to Clogwyn station and they were airlifted to hospital at Bangor for treatment for hypothermia. They are now recovering.

Prince William has been working as part of the RAF search and rescue crew at RAF Valley since January 2010 although it is not known whether he was part of the rescue team last night.

This still from a video captures the harsh conditions during the rescue of the woman and teenager. They were overcome by the cold and wind 3,000ft up Snowdon

Last night Llanberis mountain rescue team, equipped with ice axes and crampons, said the walkers were 'lucky'.

There were 70mph winds and they were just 150ft from 1,000ft cliffs in poor visibility. The mother and son had left Pen y Pass intending to go to the 3,560ft Snowdon summit via the Pyg Track.

They encountered snow and ice from the intersection of the Pyg Track and the Miners Track but continued to the summit of Snowdon despite slipping and sliding.

They then decided to descend via the Llanberis path but quickly became disorientated by wind and cold and felt unable to go on.

A rescuer said: 'The woman was extremely cold. Conditions were a lot harsher than they expected on the mountain.'

'A passing walker who was properly equipped for the conditions stopped to help them and called for assistance from the mountain rescue team.

'Both mother and son became hypothermic.'
