Tobacco companies have seen a dramatic profit increase in the last year despite the introduction of plain packaging legislation.

The profits of three major Australian tobacco companies increased by 30 percent last year due to cigarette manufacturers raising prices before anti-smoking rules were introduced.

According to data obtained by The Australian Financial Review, profits for Australia’s three major tobacco companies have more than doubled to $2.2 billion over the last five years.

Profits for major Australian tobacco companies have increased since plain packaging laws were introduced due to companies driving up the prices of cigarettes

These record profits are despite the grim predictions of the tobacco industry about the effect the plain packaging laws would have on their business.

While tobacco excise duty increased 24 cents per pack of 25 cigarettes, between August 2011 and February 2013,  tobacco companies increased their prices and increased their revenue.

The three major companies – British American Tobacco Australasia, Philip Morris Australia and Imperial Tobacco Australia – normally increase their prices above the rate of excise increases, but prices jumped significantly in mid-2011 when the federal government indicated it would introduce plain packaging laws.

Data compiled by Cancer Council Victoria shows that the average price of one cigarette increased by 34 cents from 43.9 cents in 2008 to 78.2 cents in 2014.

A pack of Winfield 25s went from $16.55 in August 2011 to $18.75 in February 2013. Of this $2.20 difference, the Australian Financial Review reported that 44 cents was excise and GST and the remaining $1.56 was profit for the company.

The increased profits are despite Treasury data released late in June that showed cigarette sales have dropped since plain packaging became mandatory in December 2012, with 3.4 percent fewer cigarettes sold in 2013 compared to 2012.
