He made his modelling debut for Burberry last year - and the world cooed in unison.

Such a success was his first foray into fashion that the iconic British brand has invited 12-year-old Romeo Beckham back to star in its Christmas campaign. 

Romeo, who is the second eldest son of David and Victoria, steals the spotlight in the Burberry Festive campaign, From London with Love.

Beckham is back: Romeo, 12, has been unveiled as the star of Burberry's Christmas campaign and proves he's following in his mother Victoria's fashionable footsteps showcasing his style credentials in the new imagery

Following his mother into the fashion world, the youngster was hand-picked by the British label's Chief Creative Officer, Christopher Bailey, for the second time.

As well as posing in a series of campaign shots, Romeo also stars in a short film, which promises to take the audience on a magical festive journey.

Speaking about the campaign and working with the young Beckham, Christopher Bailey said: 'This festive campaign is a celebration of everything we love at Burberry; the trench coat, the cashmere scarf, incredible music, our British weather, and working with great and talented people.

'It continues to be an utter joy working with Romeo – he has charm, style and great energy! I’m delighted that he’s the lead role in our festive campaign.'

Looking old beyond his years, but still exuding a youthful playfulness, Romeo wears a classic Burberry trench and  his own monogrammed checked scarf.

In one shot, the  youngster looks dapper in a tuxedo, and in another he holds an umbrella as he glances pensively into the distance.

The new campaign film is set against a theatrical London backdrop, which comes alive with over 50 dancers who give a performance inspired by the golden age of cinematic musicals.

The story captures a boy delivering the gift of love to a young couple, played by new British models and dancers Hannah Dodds and Anders Hayward, and aims to celebrate gifting as the ultimate symbol of a connection between people.

Shot on location at a custom-designed set on the George Lucas stage at Elstree Studios in London, the dancers perform to choreography by Lynne Page, specially designed for the exclusive campaign soundtrack ‘The Way that I Live’.

Burberry are well known for supporting up-and-coming musicians and the likes of Paloma Faith and Tom Odell have performed live sets at previous catwalk shows. 

The launch of the campaign also coincides with the grand unveiling of Burberry's festive gifts in store and online. 

Like what you see? Well, you can snap up all of the iconic pieces featured in the campaign, including the Heritage trench coat, the cashmere scarf, men’s tailoring, women’s eveningwear, and the new Burberry Beauty make-up look created by Burberry Make-up Artistic Consultant, Wendy Rowe.

The new Cara? Little is known about Hannah but Burberry has a history of catapulting young stars to international stardom 

You can also make it personal thanks to a full monogramming service that allows you to print three initials on cashmere scarves (a la Romeo), colour block ponchos, and the My Burberry fragrance. 

As well as a model, young Romeo will be a screen star thanks to the advertising campaign, which will run across outdoor advertising, cinema, and all of the brand's 10 global social media platforms for three months.

The luxury fashion house will no doubt be hoping for a similar boost in sales to when Romeo starred alongside Cara Delevingne in the SS13 campaign.

The brand  revealed at the time that the advertising campaign featuring the school boy helped them notch up a 13 per cent hike in sales.

The British brand said it had an 'exceptional' response to its spring/summer collection. 

It's already been a great year for brand Burberry, who unveiled Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne as the faces of the My Burberry fragrance campaign and Suki Waterhouse as the star of the beauty range.

Developed by Burberry Make-up Artistic Consultant Wendy Rowe, under the creative direction of Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Bailey, the campaign look features naturally illuminated skin with golden highlights, gold enhanced eyes and lips and nails in festive red hues - basically the kind of look we all want to emulate.

'This make-up look was all about celebrating the spirit of the festive season, and the overall mood and attitude of the campaign,' said Wendy.

'To create the signature Burberry Glow, I used Fresh Glow Luminous Fluid Base in Nude Radiance: my absolute make-up must-have for any look, and added Fresh Glow Foundation to create flawless coverage and to even out the skin tone.”

'To mirror the glow of the face we also used Fresh Glow Luminous Fluid Base in Nude Radiance on the body and décolletage.”

'To finish the look and to create golden highlights I added a light dusting of Gold Glow - the new limited edition My Burberry fragranced illuminising powder - created to celebrate the launch of My Burberry. It is super lightweight with a hint of the fragrance.'
