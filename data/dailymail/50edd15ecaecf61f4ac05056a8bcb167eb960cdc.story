The 30 Greenpeace activists held by the Russians have been told charges against them are being dropped.

Anthony Perrett, from South Wales, learned on Tuesday that he was free to leave the country.

The others were told yesterday.

They are expected to fly home within days.

The
 30, including six Britons, were held at gunpoint by Russian secret 
services as they protested about oil exploration in the Arctic, even 
though their Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise was in international waters.

They were originally charged with piracy and faced up to 15 years in jail.

This was changed to ‘hooliganism’, which can carry six years behind bars.

They
 are being freed under a Kremlin-backed amnesty, ahead of February’s 
Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, that also saw the release of two Pussy 
Riot singers and former oil baron Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

Last week they were told they would be amnestied.

Despite this, the Russian authorities
 dragged their heels, and instead of being home with the families, the 
group marked Christmas Day by attending the Investigative Committee, 
equivalent of the FBI, were they were told their cases were dropped

They also held a lunch in St Petersburg, where they have been staying since they were freed on bail last month.

'The
 group was asked to attend a meeting at Russia's powerful Investigative 
Committee, where the criminal case against them is being dropped en 
masse,' Greenpeace said in a statement, describing the move as 'the 
final chapter'.

The 26 foreigners among the 30 'are expected to leave Russia in the coming days', Greenpeace said.

It added that 19 have formally had the cases against them dropped, with the others expected to hear imminently.

Mr Perrett said: 'It's time to go home, it's time to get back to Wales, and I just got one big step closer.'

The move is part of a Kremlin-backed amnesty which also saw freedom for two Pussy Riot singers and ex-oil baron Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a prominent foe of Vladimir Putin.  

The moves are aimed at easing criticism of the Kremlin ahead of February's Winter Olympic Games in Sochi.

The US captain of the Arctic Sunrise ship Peter Willcox said he was 'pleased and relieved the charges have been dropped'.

'This is the day we've been waiting for since our ship was boarded by armed commandos almost three months ago,' he said.

'I'm pleased and relieved the charges have been dropped, but we should not have been charged at all.'

Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom, whose Prirazlomnaya rig was the target of the Greenpeace protest, last week started oil production at the platform.
