An illegal immigrant clung to the bottom of a school bus for more than 100 miles after it made its way back to the UK from a day trip to France.

The bus was packed with pupils from a school in Ilford, northeast London, when the driver heard noises coming from underneath the coach.

The driver drove the coach to Ilford Police Station, where cops found a 16-year-old from Sudan 'attached to the   chassis'.

It is believed he sneaked under the bus in Calais and managed to hold on for 107 miles - until he was caught in Ilford.

The secondary schoolchildren had been on a day trip to Calais and were returning around 7pm, when the driver heard noises and suspected he was carrying   a stowaway.

Police arrested the teen, who had no ID documents with him but said he was originally from Sudan, on suspicion of illegal entry into the UK on Friday.

He remains in custody ahead of an interview with immigration workers.

A spokesman for the Met Police said: 'Shortly before 7.15pm on Friday, June 27, a coach driver attended Ilford Police Station reporting   that noises coming from underneath the vehicle were suspected to be from an hidden stowaway.

'Officers searched the underneath of the coach and found a man attached to the chassis. He was arrested on suspicion of illegal entry into the UK and   taken into custody at the station.

'The arrested man informed police he was 16 years-old and from Sudan - Immigration authorities have been informed.'

A spokesman for Dan's Luxury Travels, the coach company which was used for the school trip, said: 'The driver did what he had to do. 

'He did his legal checks for the vehicle. When he heard a noise underneath he took it straight to the police station and the man was arrested.'

Local Adrian Travers, 45, said: 'The poor guy looked terrified - imagine hanging on to the bottom of a bus all the way from Calais.'

On Saturday it was reported that school pupils on a trip to France were left in tears after their coach was targeted twice by illegal immigrants.

Youngsters from St John Fisher Catholic High School in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, were forced to watch as border officers detained two stowaways at   Calais.

One suspect tried to board the bus when the pupils were going through passport control and another was spotted breaking in while the children were at a   shopping centre.

Both of the suspects were arrested in front of the horrified children during the £300 four-day trip.
