A Pakistani schoolgirl shot by the Taliban for championing the rights to women's education has told the United Nations there are 'thousands' across the world like her struggling for the same cause.

Malala Yousafzai, who has been recovering in the UK from last year's attack, told the youth assembly in New York: 'Thousands of people have been killed by terrorists and millions injured - I am just one of them.'

Today is Malala's 16th birthday - declared Malala Day - and the teenager's speech to more than 500 delegates at the UN's headquarters was her first public address.

Watch below...

Speech: Malala Yousafzai, the 16-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot in the head by the Taliban for wanting to attend school, addresses the UN youth assembly in New YorkÂ 

As she took to the dais, there was a standing ovation and cheers of delight for the young girl who cheated an assassin's bullet when she was shot in the head during an attack on her school bus in the north-western Swat Valley last year.

She said: 'Malala Day is not my day - today is the day of every woman, every boy and every girl who have raised their voice for their rights.

'There are hundreds of human rights activists and social workers who are not speaking for their rights but who are struggling to achieve their goal of peace, education and equality.

'Thousands of people have been killed by the terrorists and millions injured - I am just one of them.'

Speaking about the attempt on her life, she added: 'On the 9th October 2012, the 
Taliban shot me on the left side of my forehead and they shot friends 
too.

Courage: Malala was given a standing ovation and there were cheers of delight as she stepped up to speak

Solidarity: The 16-year-old told the UN youth assembly said that there were 'thousands' across the world like her struggling for the same cause

'They thought that the bullet would silence us - but they failed.

'Out of that silence came thousands of voices.

'The terrorists thought they would change my aim and stop my ambitions.

'But nothing changed except this weakness, fear and helplessness died, and strength, power and courage was born.'

Malala presented U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon with a petition signed by nearly 4 million people in support of 57 million children who are not able to go to school and demanding that world leaders fund new teachers, schools and books and end child labor, marriage and trafficking.

U.N. Special Envoy for Global 
Education, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, said Friday's 
event was not just a celebration of Malala's birthday and her recovery, 
but of her vision.

The 15-year-old was shot after being targeted by the Taliban for demanding education in Pakistan

'Her
dream that nothing, no political indifference, no government inaction, 
no intimidation, no threats, no assassin's bullets should ever deny the 
right of every single child ... to be able to go to school,' said Brown.

Pakistan has 5 million children out of school, a number only surpassed by Nigeria, which has more than 10 million children out of school, according to U.N. cultural agency UNESCO. Most of those are girls.

Islamist gunmen killed 27 students and a teacher on Saturday in a boarding school in northeast Nigeria.

It was the deadliest of at least 
three attacks on schools in Nigeria since the military launched an 
offensive in May to try to crush Islamist insurgent group Boko Haram, 
whose nickname translates as 'Western education is sinful' in the 
northern Hausa language.

The
Taliban claimed responsibility for the assassination attempt on Malala, calling her efforts pro-Western. Two of her classmates were 
also wounded.

Yousafzai was treated in Britain, where doctors mended parts of her skull with a titanium plate. Unable to safely return to Pakistan, she started at a school in Birmingham in March.

Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), formed in 2007, is an umbrella group uniting various militant factions operating in Pakistan's volatile northwestern tribal areas along the porous border with Afghanistan.

Under Taliban rule in neighboring Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, women were forced to cover up and were banned from voting, most work and leaving their homes unless accompanied by a husband or male relative.
