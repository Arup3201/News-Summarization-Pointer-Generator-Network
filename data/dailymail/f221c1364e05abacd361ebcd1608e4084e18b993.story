New York City has spent $18 million in five years unclogging 'flushable' wet wipes from the sewer system.

As the products have become increasingly popular, many manufacturers claim to have 'adapted' them to biodegrade when flushed.

But the city's waste management directors have told the New York Times: that is not the case.

'Indestructible': Wet wipes branded as 'flushable' have been clogging up the system by twisting into knots

When the wipes twist into a knot and mix with grease or oil, they are 'really indestructible,' deputy commissioner Vincent Sapienza of the Department of Environmental Protection said.

Worming their way into the pipes of homes, offices and public buildings, the wipes have doubled the amount of solid waste that needs to be extracted from water treatment plants.

Dave Rousse, president of the wipes trade group, insisted to the Times that users are not flushing the products properly.

Outrage: New York City's water waste management has spent $18 million on wet wipes in five years

His words have been slammed by city officials - and waste water managers around the country - who insist the wipes should be disposed of in the trash.

The controversy could be solved by an experiment, backed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, that will test which wipes survive the entire sewage system.

If so, under a new bill, the manufacturers would be ordered to remove the term 'flushable' from its packaging.
