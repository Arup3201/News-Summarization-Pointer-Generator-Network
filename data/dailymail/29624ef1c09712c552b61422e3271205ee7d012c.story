Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith will today call for more welfare changes

Jobless couples with more than two children should have benefit payments limited, Iain Duncan Smith suggested yesterday.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said there were ‘large numbers’ of couples on welfare having big families – unlike middle-income parents who had to weigh up if they could afford to have another child.

Mr Duncan Smith condemned the ‘madness’ of the state subsidising large workless families – saying it would be fairer to the ‘vast majority’ of responsible taxpayers if benefits were limited to the first two children in future.

He has agreed to find another £10billion in welfare savings by 2016, having already slashed £18billion from a vast budget that grew by 60 per cent under Labour.

As well as cuts to child benefit and tax credits for large workless families, he suggested housing benefit could be stripped for those who expected to go straight from school on to welfare and a state-subsidised house.

Liberal Democrat sources, however, warned nothing had been agreed and suggested the proposals were ‘just Tory kite-flying’.

A senior Lib Dem source said: ‘It doesn’t even save very much money as we’ve already introduced a benefits cap.’ But Mr Duncan Smith said more reforms were vital as the Government sought to control public finances.

He dismissed suggestions the Coalition was ‘hurting’ claimants – insisting the real cruelty was leaving people languishing on welfare for years. ‘We have accepted for far too long in this country that it is possible for people to just stay on benefits,’ he said. ‘It is all about saying, we will give you massive support to find work... But also, we have an expectation, as the taxpayer pays for these bills, that you try your hardest to find work.’

Most controversially, Mr Duncan Smith 
suggested the present system encouraged poorer families to have large 
numbers of children without worrying about the cost.

‘When you look at families across the 
board, at all incomes, you find the vast, vast majority make decisions 
about the kind of numbers of children they have, the families they want,
based on what they think they can afford,’ he said.

‘Where you see the clustering of the 
large families is really down at the very lowest incomes, those on 
significant levels of welfare, and those on the very top incomes. In 
other words, the problem for those who are paying the taxes, paying the 
bills – they make the decisions about their lives, even if they 
sometimes would like to maybe have extra children, they make decisions.

‘People who are having support through
welfare are often free from that decision. We want to support people if
they have children when they are out of work, of course.

‘But can there not be a limit to the 
fact that really you need to remember you need to cut your cloth in 
accordance with what capabilities and what finances you have?’

In his speech to the Cambridge Public 
Policy think-tank, he suggested only welfare claimants having children 
in future would be affected, not existing families.

Alison Garnham, of the Child Poverty 
Action Group, said: ‘When parents plan their families they’re not 
thinking about whether at some point in future they might be on 
benefit.’

Liam Byrne, Labour’s work and pensions spokesman, said: ‘The truth is it’s working people who are seeing their help axed.’
