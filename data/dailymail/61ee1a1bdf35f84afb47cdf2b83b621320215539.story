Thousands of air passengers face severe travel disruption today after a number of flights were cancelled due to high winds and heavy rain caused by the remnants of Hurricane Gonzalo.

Staff at Heathrow said that 10 per cent of flights with the 20 biggest airlines that serve the London airport had been cancelled after winds of up to 75mph battered the country. 

A Heathrow spokesman said: 'There will be some cancellations, around 10 per cent of flights are affected at Heathrow. We do not know exactly how many passengers or flights that will have an impact on.

Please check your flight status with your airline before coming to the airport and leave extra time for your journey to and from the airport.'

British Airways, which has already cancelled flights between Amsterdam and London, added: 'Much of the UK and Northern Europe will experience high winds and heavy rain on Tuesday as a result of the tail-end of Hurricane Gonzalo.

'British Airways has agreed with a request from Heathrow Airport and National Air Traffic Services (Nats) to reduce its schedule at Heathrow as there will be a lower number of aircraft allowed to land each hour for safety reasons.

'Other airports have also reduced the number of aircraft they are able to handle.

'We are sorry that a number of short-haul and domestic flights have been cancelled and others may experience delays as a result of the poor weather. We are working as hard as we can to mitigate any disruption.' 

Meanwhile on the railways Virgin Trains said that heavy rain may affect services today with a spokesman urging travellers to check before setting off. 

Forecasters also warned there will be 'significant disruptions' to road travel with commuters told the winds could bring trees down. 

The warnings came after the Met Office issued a yellow warning for most of the country as the gale force winds tore across the UK from the storm which left a trail of destruction in Bermuda. 

Northern Scotland will see the worst of the weather tomorrow with inland areas being hit by gales of up to 55mph.

This will be followed by heavy rain in places with experts predicting two weeks of rainfall in just 24 hours.

The gale force winds are expected to bring down trees and cause leaves to fall impeding drainage and increasing risk of surface water

Sean Penston, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: 'There will be strengthening winds and rain over Ireland in the middle of the evening as the storm comes in from the Atlantic.

'It will reach north-western parts of Britain late in the evening, with gusts up to 45mph over north-western parts of Scotland by midnight, but these will increase to gusts up to 75mph during the night.

'The area of rainy, windy weather will then move eastwards, varying in intensity across the UK, with the strongest gusts on the coasts.

'We can expect gusts up to 65mph in the north west tomorrow morning, and up to 50mph in central and eastern parts of England in the afternoon.'

Nicola Maxey, from the Met Office, said: 'The winds may affect commuters in rush hour tomorrow morning so people should allow extra time for driving and those driving high-sided vehicles should be cautious.

'We may see some tree damage and there will be rain across most places in the early hours of the morning.

'Fallen leaves impeding drainage increases the risk of surface water affecting roads, while some damage to trees is possible, given that many are still in full leaf.'

Forecaster, Simon Partridge, added: 'Expect winds to increase and rain in the West of around 10mm on average south of the M4. North of there you'll be looking at 20mm, with up to 40mm on high ground.' 

The average rainfall for the whole of October is typically around 90mm.
