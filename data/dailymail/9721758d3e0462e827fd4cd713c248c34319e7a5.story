Comedian Ken Dodd, 87 (pictured), who was made an OBE in 1982 for services to showbusiness and charity, said he would like to receive a knighthood during an awards ceremony in London on Tuesday

The acquittal over his tax affairs failed to dent his popularity but scuppered his chances of a knighthood.

However try telling that to Ken Dodd.

Yesterday the comedian declared he deserved to be given the honour.

Dodd, 87, said: ‘Of course I would like one [a knighthood], it would keep my ears warm in bed. No but seriously, I don’t know why I have not had one. It is up to them. You wait for the call, if you get it you get it. There is no harm done.’

Dodd, who was made an OBE in 1982 for services to showbusiness and charity, is best known for his variety style comedy routines. He is the king of the diddymen, the squire of Knotty Ash and the clown with the tickling stick.

And he is also known as a singer, having been Britain’s highest-selling pop artist of the Sixties.

Unlike many of his comedy peers, Dodd continues to tour with his ‘Happiness Show’ and will perform 31 dates before the end of the year.

However, while he remains one of Britain’s favourite entertainers, on paper he is not a perfect candidate for a knighthood.

Dodd made headlines when he was charged with tax evasion in 1989, before being later acquitted after a three-week trial. More than 20 years later, Dodd admitted he prefers to ignore letters from the tax office.

He said: ‘My tribulations were 25 years ago. It is history. It has gone. They still write to me you know...the little brown envelopes, those dreaded brown envelopes with OHMS on...Oh Help Us Miserable Sods. They sent me a Christmas card saying “It is more blessed to give than it is to receive”.

‘They sent me a form recently saying “estimate your income for next year”. They are not satisfied with the blood they have had from this year. I am not going to sign it, they can guess what I am earning next year if they can guess who sent it in.’

Dodd added that he recently returned an invitation to the tax office, pretending it had been sent to the wrong address. He said: ‘[Wrote] on the envelope “Gone away, not known at this address. Cannot be reached”. The tax office is full of grinning tax inspectors, squeezing stones.’

Dodd is not the first star to criticise the lack of recognition for comedians.

In 2012 Sir Bruce Forsyth, 86, said he was delighted to receive a knighthood but said it was rare event for comedians from his era.

He said: ‘It seems the comedy field and the entertainment field are never recognised in the same way [as others]’.

Asked whether he thought it was wrong he hadn’t received a knighthood sooner in his career, Sir Bruce said: ‘but neither did Morecambe and Wise, or Tommy Cooper.’

Ronnie Corbett, 84, has also questioned why so many talented entertainers had never been given knighthoods.

He said Ronnie Barker – the other half of The Two Ronnies – should have been given one before his death and also singled out Tommy Cooper, saying: ‘There are many who did not live to receive one.’

Dodd made his comments as he was presented with the Oldie of the Year Award at the annual ceremony on Tuesday.

Other winners included Michael Buerk, 68, who picked up the Jungle Survivor of the Year award for his 19-night stint on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! and Lord Falconer, 63, who was named Slimmer of the Year.
