Owen Farrell and George Ford could rekindle their junior partnership this weekend as England consider naming both players in the starting line-up to face South Africa.

With Kyle Eastmond struck down by illness, head coach Stuart Lancaster could be short of options in the midfield for Saturday’s Test against the Springboks. 

Luther Burrell is also sidelined with a hand injury and the England selection panel are now deliberating whether to name Farrell at No 12, with Bath playmaker Ford pulling the strings at fly-half.

Sir Clive Woodward urged Lancaster to move Farrell

Sir Clive Woodward wrote in his Sportsmail column on Monday that England are in need of a natural kicker like Farrell at inside centre — something that Eastmond does not offer — and the Ford-Farrell combination would tick that box.

The pair, who were once opponents at junior rugby league clubs in Yorkshire, thrived in the same partnership at England age-group level, when they lost just two games in five years.

‘I’m sure he (Kyle) will get over the sickness and diarrhoea, but it’s about how much it takes out of him and the knock-on effect of not doing the work,’ said Lancaster. ‘The obvious options are to put George in at 10 and Owen at 12.

‘You can bring someone like Billy Twelvetrees in at 12, while Luther Burrell is on a return to play this week but he hasn’t done anything for two or three weeks, so isn’t really in the equation for us. They are the options.’

Johann van Graan has hailed England’s Graham Rowntree as ‘one of the best forwards coaches in the world’, who has created a ‘world-class scrum’. 

He added: ‘Graham is a good friend of mine. We coached against each other for the first time in 2012. What a great guy and what a great (team of) coaching staff — just look at guys like Stuart Lancaster, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt.’

The physical threat posed by the Springboks might count against Ford in selection, but Lancaster will weigh up the pros and cons in Tuesday's training session at Pennyhill Park. Ford’s small stature — 13st 3lb compared to Farrell’s 15st 2lb frame — could lead to him being targeted by some of South Africa’s powerful ball-carriers.

Lancaster added: ‘It is a four-game series. I’ve got in my own mind further games and options to look at combinations. 

‘The question in my mind is: do you give the players another opportunity who played their part last week (in the 24-21 defeat by New Zealand) to improve on that performance? Because there is a lot of frustration.’

Head injuries to Courtney Lawes and Dylan Hartley mean the Northampton pair will have cognitive testing ahead of Thursday’s team announcement.

Dave Attwood also picked up a minor knock and a hip injury to Semesa Rokoduguni, who is expected to train on Tuesday, will have Anthony Watson on red alert ahead of a possible promotion to the starting XV.

Lancaster is hopeful that all will be available for selection, while Ben Morgan is also pushing to oust Billy Vunipola after the No 8’s impact off the bench on Saturday. The latest injury problems are far from ideal for Lancaster, who is hoping to end a barren winless run against South Africa this weekend. England have suffered 10 defeats and one draw in their last 11 meetings with the Rainbow Nation, having failed to record a victory since 2006.

The Monday morning debrief after Saturday’s defeat at Twickenham was, in the words of loosehead prop Joe Marler, ‘very honest’, but focus must now turn towards their next challenge.

The Quins front-row said the second-half performance was worthy of words that he ‘can’t really use’ and has promised to bottle up the frustration ahead of the second Test on Saturday. 

‘The Southern Hemisphere teams have set the standard over the years and are continuing to do so,’ said Marler. 

‘But I’d like to think we’ve got a squad now who can go toe-to-toe with them. It’s about having the belief that we’re not just capable of hanging in there against them, but can ramp it up ourselves at the right time and can take them to some darker places.’

But while England will still be seething from their defeat by the All Blacks, South Africa will arguably be even more aggrieved after their shock 29-15 loss to Ireland. 

England will face some hugely powerful forwards in the likes of Duane Vermeulen, Victor Matfield and Bismarck du Plessis and Marler knows his side must front up if they are to overcome their Southern Hemisphere hoodoo.

‘Against every international team at the moment you’ve got to be physical otherwise you’re going to get pumped,’ said Marler. 

‘South Africa as a nation stand very tall and proud; their DNA is run hard and, if that doesn’t work, run harder. They pride themselves on that and they’ve got a world-class tight five.’
