Howard Webb has blown the final whistle on his 25-year refereeing career to take up a technical role with the governing body for officials and help bring through the next generation of men in the middle.

The well-respected Webb has been England’s representative at the last four major international tournaments and he took charge of his final match at Brazil 2014 when the hosts beat Chile on penalties.

Part-time policeman Webb, popular on the pitch for his authority and straight-talking, puts away his cards having taken charge of more than 500 Barclays Premier League and Football League fixtures since becoming a Select Group referee in 2003.

Calling time: Howard Webb has ended his distinguished career as a top level referee to take up a technical director with Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL)

Top level: Webb, seen here with Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney, has taken charge of more than 500 matches in the Premier League and Football League since becoming a Select Group official in 2003

Widely regarded as the best English  
referee of his generation, he was praised for his rapid response when 
Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba collapsed with a heart attack in an FA
 Cup tie at  Tottenham in February 2012, an incident that left a lasting
 impact on Webb.

In 2010 he 
became the first person to  referee a Champions League final and World 
Cup final in the same year but will also be remembered for failing to 
send off Nigel de Jong for his kung-fu kick into the chest of Xabi 
Alonso when Spain beat Holland in Johannesburg.

In
 his new role, the 43-year-old from  Yorkshire will oversee the 
standards of referees for Professional Game Match Official Limited 
(PGMOL) and work on the development programme that guides aspiring 
officials to the top level.

He
 will also have an increased media presence, with one of his primary 
functions to offer technical advice to the television rights-holders, 
including Sky Sports, BT and the BBC with Match Of The Day.

‘I am very excited to start this new chapter in my career after a wonderfully rewarding 25 years on the pitch,’ Webb said.

International standard: Webb has been selected for two World Cups and two European Championships 

In control: Webb has been regarded as one of the best Premier League officials for some time

‘Refereeing
 has given me so much and it’s important that match officials who have 
had the rewards remain in the game to pass on their knowledge.’

Webb
 was chastised for supposedly favouring Manchester United, and 
Liverpool winger Ryan Babel was fined for posting on Twitter a doctored 
picture of the referee wearing a United shirt. On Wednesday the social 
media site was littered with some amusing takes on his perceived bias, 
even though he is a proclaimed Rotherham fan.

Michael
 Owen paid tribute to Webb, saying: ‘I know praising refs isn’t easily 
done by some but fair play to Howard Webb, arguably the world’s best for
 the last few years.’

Webb 
started out in 1989 by refereeing games in the local leagues of 
Yorkshire and in 1998 took leave from his job with South Yorkshire 
Police. In 2011, he was awarded an MBE for services to football.

PGMOL
 chief Mike Riley said: ‘Howard has been the foremost referee of his 
generation and an inspiration for match officials in this country and 
around the world.’
