Hull City will reignite their interest in Sheffield United defender Harry Maguire despite the Blades’ claims they have already accepted an offer.

In a bizarre chain of events, the Sky Bet League One club released a statement saying they had accepted an offer from their Yorkshire rivals, only for Hull to claim they had withdrawn interest after their final bid was rejected.

A club statement from Hull said: ‘Sheffield United rejected an offer from the Club five days (Wednesday) ago for defender Harry Maguire. This was the Club’s final offer and we have since entered into discussions with other transfer targets.

Rock solid: Sheffield United claimed to have accepted a bid but Hull then denied that

‘In light 
of Sheffield United’s statement this morning the board will meet with 
manager Steve Bruce this afternoon to determine whether we now wish to 
pursue the transfer after the South Yorkshire club’s apparent U-turn.’

Earlier on
 Monday morning The Blades’ managing director Mal Brannigan told the 
club’s website: ‘We made it clear that we wanted Harry to stay by 
offering him a new contract at the end of last season, unfortunately he 
and his representatives chose a different path.

‘However, 
as he is under contract at Bramall Lane, we exercised our right to set 
our own valuation of him and after numerous bids which did not meet our 
expectations, Hull City increased their offer and we have reluctantly 
accepted.

‘As we 
have previously stated, Sheffield United are not under pressure to sell 
our players but on this occasion it was deemed the best for all parties 
and now we move on with the aim of assisting Nigel Clough to strengthen 
his squad.’
