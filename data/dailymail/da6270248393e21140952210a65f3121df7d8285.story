At a prep school in Kent, during High Tea, a master asks his pupils if anyone would like to do ballet.

In a sea of waving girls’ paws, only one little boy’s hand shoots up. Mine.

And then, with howl of the other children’s laughter echoing in my ears, I realised: boys don’t do ballet. So I bottled out, and I have always regretted it.

Called to the Barre: Richard Dennen is put through his paces in his BarreCorre class by owner Niki Rein

Today, male ballet dancers are the new rock stars. The Adonis-like Brazilian Carlos Acosta is a household name and Sergei Polunin, a 23-year-old tattooed Russian wild child, made headlines when he sensationally quit as principal of the Royal Ballet last year.

Now, apparently, rock stars are doing ballet. Mick Jagger, a sprightly 69 and preparing to headline the Glastonbury Festival with The Rolling Stones next weekend, has revealed how he credited his remarkable fitness to ballet.

Then I heard about the ballet-based workout class at Barrecore studio on Kings Road, Chelsea, run by fitness guru Niki Rein. She is rumoured to be behind Princess Beatrice’s new figure and I was intrigued to find out what you have to go through to get a ballet body...

NOT JUST FOR GIRLS

The
 class is actually a hybrid of Pilates and ballet, incorporating cardio,
 light weights and various stretching and balancing poses, all to music.

It’s most certainly not just for girls. ‘Half of the guys who come can’t finish their first class,’ says Niki. ‘We work on legs and the lower half of the body, which men aren’t used to.

'Men are stronger in the upper body so they power through press-ups. But then they stand at the barre and after the first set of thighs their legs are all over the place, the eyes glaze over .  .  . they start to get dizzy.’

I thought I was going to die after my first class, but I could quickly see why it’s becoming a cult hit.

A number of gyms have started offering ballet-style workouts, and Britain’s biggest, Virgin Active, is looking at rolling it out nationwide.

There is genuine sports science behind it. Gillian Reeves, national group exercise manager for Virgin Active, explains: ‘Ballet improves posture, balance and co-ordination.

'The exercises all promote muscular strength and endurance but won’t bulk the body, helping to give that lean, dancer physique. For the greatest benefits, a healthy diet is needed also.’

A PERKIER BOTTOM

Niki promises longer, leaner limbs and the pert bottom of a dancer. ‘Ballet makes you leaner, and stand taller.

'There is a focus on the back of the body and if the back is strong, then it makes the shoulders look broader, you carry yourself taller, and the waist looks smaller.’

Niki arrived in London in 2009 after working with dance-cardio celebrity trainer Tracey Anderson and celebrities including Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow.

She started a private barre class in a client’s mews house and, when 25 ladies turned up, quickly realised that London needed her.

THIGHS FEEL THE BURN

The class, for normally no more than ten to 15 people, lasts an hour and takes place in a dance studio with a mirrored wall and a long rail – the barre – that runs the length of the room, just above my waist height.

After a warm-up, there are press-ups and planks (where you hold the extended press-up position until your middle is shaking with the strain) .  .  . and then the real workout starts. There are various ballet-inspired positions: holding a ball between your thighs, you stand on tiptoe and pulse up and down. In another you lean forward with your head on the bar, wiggling your leg while it’s extended behind you.

My thighs burn, my legs tremble. Later, I am so stiff and sore I think I might have done permanent damage.

IT WORKS... BUT IT HURTS

After a month of going once a week, I am gradually getting more flexible.

Like most men, I have very tight hamstrings. But now my standing splits – where you bend forward, hands flat on the floor, while you try to extend one leg back and point to the ceiling – are getting a bit better.

We’re told that 15 minutes of ballet can burn up to 100 calories, and my body has changed. I am slimmer: if anything, I look at bit too skinny.

But the gender divide remains: in a month I only saw one other man in the class. I think that boys are scared of ballet. You have to swallow your pride, as I did, collapsing on the mat while the woman next to me did 15 push-ups with her leg in the air.

To anyone who is man enough to try it, I can confirm it works. But God, it hurts.

Hour-long classes start from £24 at the Barrecore  studio, Kings Road, London SW3. barrecore.co.uk.
