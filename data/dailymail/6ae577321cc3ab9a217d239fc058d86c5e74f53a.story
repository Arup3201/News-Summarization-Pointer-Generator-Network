These dramatic pictures show the aftermath of a brazen robbery where thieves used a JCB digger to rip a cash machine from a Co-op supermarket. 

The thieves left a trail of destruction after the ATM was forced from the wall of the Co-op store in Haxby, York, at around 2.25am this morning. 

They then made their escape in a pick-up truck - leaving the JCB in front of the demolished shop.

The Co-op in Haxby, York, was targeted at 2.25am today and follows a string of similar attacks elsewhere

Police are making inquiries to identify the people - believed to be a group of three to four men - and are urging any witnesses to come forward.  

Amanda Nicholson, who lives opposite the shop, said she and her husband were woken just before 2.30am and called police.

She said: 'I saw a tractor or a fork-lift type vehicle going backwards and forwards into the building, and then the wall fell in.

'The cash machine fell on to the floor, and they picked it up and plonked it on the back of a truck.

'The roof fell down and nearly hit one of the raiders, but he jumped out of the way just in time.' 

They are currently reviewing the CCTV footage, a spokesman for the force said. 

Detective Inspector Andrea Kell from York CID said: 'The investigation is at a very early stage and we are trying to gather as much information as possible to help with our inquiries.

'I am appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area in the early hours of Thursday morning to get in touch with the police or Crimestoppers as soon as possible.'

Jenny Bell, from Haxby Town Council, said: 'A JCB drove into the front of the Co-op store. It's still there and whoever did it has taken away the cash machine.

'The cash machine is now missing. How they took it away I do not know.'

The Co-op in Haxby, York, as it usually looks - it was attacked to the left side of the store with a JCB digger

At around the same time, thieves targeted a cash machine at the Co-op in Ibstock, Leicestershire - the latest in a spate of similar attacks in the county.

There have also been a spate of similar robberies elsewhere in the country.   

In November thieves used a digger to smash through the brick wall of Warner's Budgens in Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, before fleeing the scene with the ATM. 

In the same month, thieves pulled away bricks leaving a gaping hole in the side of a Co-op supermarket in Sapcote, Leicestershire, which took just 20 seconds. 

Similar to the robbery in York, the digger was left at the scene. 

Thieves also ploughed a stolen JCB digger in to a Marks & Spencer store before stealing the cash machine at Malvern Retail Park in Worcestershire.  

On each occasion, the thieves carried out the attack in the early hours of the morning.
