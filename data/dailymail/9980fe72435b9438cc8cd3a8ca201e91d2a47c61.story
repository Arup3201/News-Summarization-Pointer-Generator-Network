At its peak, in the early 1990s, Muslim references were relatively common in rap songs, but over the past decade these have all but vanished from the genre.

Graphs have revealedl that references to Islamic culture in rap lyrics have been steadily dropping since the early 2000s, and are now a sixth of what they were during a peak between 1990 and 1995.

At the same time, the graphs reveal that lyrics about Jesus and Christianity have been rising.

Graphs from RapStats reveal that references to Islamic culture in rap lyrics are steadily dropping, and are now a sixth of what they were during a peak in 1990. At the same time, the graphs reveal that lyrics about Jesus and Christianity have been rising.

The trend was identified by Vocativ’s Adam Raymond.

During comparisons, he discovered that references to the word ‘Islam’ once occupied around 0.00245 per cent of songs - it now sits at 0.00037 per cent.

‘Muslim’ lyrics peaked in 1993 at 0.00156 per cent, and is now 0.0007 per cent.

The word ‘Christianity’ peaked in 1988 on 0.00035 per cent of songs, before vanishing completely during 1992 and 1993 and between 2004 and 2005. It is now referred to in 0.00012 per cent of lyrics.

The Five Percent nation - sometimes referred to as Nation of Gods and Earths - was created by Clarence Smith in 1964. 

Mr Smith is a former member of the Nation of Islam, which is a religious movement designed to improve the condition of African Americans in the US. 

The Five-Percenters get their name from the idea that only five per cent of humanity known the truth about existence and are 'poor righteous teachers' trying to tell the rest of the world the truth. 

In April, Jay-Z was photographed at the Barclay's Center wearing a medallion symbolising the Five Percent Nation. 

It is widely reportef that one of the core tenets of the Five Percent Nation is that white people are 'wicked and inferior' to black men.

Meanwhile, the word ‘Christian’ has been rising since 1995, up from 0.008 per cent to 0.00253 per cent.

Mr Raymond also compared Jesus’ versus ‘Muhammad.’

Between 1988 and 1992, the references were at similar levels, after which ‘Jesus’ soared and ‘Muhammad’ stayed constant.

Mr Raymond explained that Muslim rappers affiliated, or who identified with Islamic group Five Percent Nation were at a high during the 1990s - and this may explain the peaks.

Rappers linked with Islam, either through this group or as practicing members of the religion, include Nas, Mos Def and Q-Tip.

In Common and Q-Tip’s 1996 song The Remedy, taken from Get on the Bus soundtrack, Q-Tip raps: ‘To the human beings with taste, sight, touch, smell and sound. 

'Let's deem it profound! And prioritise this cause it was Allah's wish.’

While in Nas’ 1999 Ghetto Prisoners, he raps: ‘Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised? The mighty dollar - or almighty Allah.’

And in Common’s G.O.D. (Gaining One's Definition) featuring Cee-Lo from 1997, lyrics address both Islam and Christianity: ‘Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital.

Between 1988 and 1992, the references to 'Jesus' and 'Muhammad' were at similar frequencies, after which ‘Jesus’ soared and ‘Muhammad’ stayed constant

‘And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys.

‘You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief, but one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em

‘And use religion as an emblem, when it should be a natural way of life

‘Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right.

There is also a notable decline in Islamic references in the early 2000s, which may have been caused by the negativity around the religion caused by the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

‘That's who got you doin right and got you this far,

‘Whether you say ‘in Jesus name’ or ‘Al hum du'Allah’

However, as Mr Raymond points out, many of these rappers are older now and don’t appeal to ‘hip-hop’s young fan base.’

There is also a notable decline in references in the early 2000s, which may have been caused by the negativity around the religion caused by the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

He said: 'In the decade after 9/11, America’s views toward Islam plummeted. 

'Meanwhile, Christianity is viewed much more positively than Islam. Simply put, Jesus is a much easier sell than Muhammad.'
