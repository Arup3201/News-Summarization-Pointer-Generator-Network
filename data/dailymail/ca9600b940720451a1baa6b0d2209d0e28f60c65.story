Asked whether he would rather win $11.44million at the FedEx Cup finale or be part of a winning American Ryder Cup team, Masters champion Bubba Watson hesitated for only a second.

‘That would be a tough one,’ he began, before delivering an answer suggesting it wasn’t hard at all. ‘When you look at my career, I’ve won a major, I’ve won other tournaments but I’ve never won the Ryder Cup.

‘At the end of my career I would love to have done that and who knows, this might be my last chance. So right now I would like to win the Ryder Cup. I would like to experience the team atmosphere that follows a win.’

Team player: Bubba Watson has his sights set on Ryder Cup glory

How they shape up: Watson is third in the rankings

That’s rather thrown the gauntlet down then, hasn’t it? His answer was certainly a refreshing contrast to the depressing one Tiger Woods gave to a similar question in 2002, when he said there were a million reasons why he would rather win the $1m first prize at the American Express Championship than the Ryder Cup played the following week.

Watson showed how much he loves the biennial competition at the last edition at Medinah. He was a revelation, catching the Europeans off-guard completely on the opening day when he encouraged the crowd to cheer as he struck his drive off the first tee. Will he be doing something similar at Gleneagles?

‘No, I will not be doing that,’ he said, smiling broadly. ‘We were on home soil and it was just my little way of trying to grow the game of golf. I loved it when Ian Poulter joined in the following day but it was a one-time thing. And I would not do that especially on foreign soil, where they might be against it.’ 

The 35-year-old from Bagdad, Florida is often portrayed as country yokel but his answers display a real street intelligence. 

Getting into the swing of things: Watson during practice in Atlanta on Tuesday

At Gleneagles he will resume his pairing with Webb Simpson that delivered two points in the fourballs at Medinah. Here was his response when one reporter suggested Simpson was the calm one in the partnership.

‘Y’all got time for a little story?’ he began. ‘Webb was playing really well going into the Presidents Cup in Australia but he was really jumpy in our match against Ernie Els and Ryo Ishikawa. We were two down after just four holes, so I took him to one side.

‘I said: “Webb, look man you’re the 8th ranked golfer in the world. Half the players above you are European so that makes you the fourth or fifth best player here. 

Eyes on the prize: Watson wants the Ryder Cup to complete his set

'Two of those are Tiger and Phil and they’re on our team. So that makes you second best. Now go out and play like it and make some putts.

‘And I think he birdied the next two holes. So I calmed him down and I see that as my role, trying to make my team-mates relax.’

Only once did we get goofy Bubba. Watson said he would prepare for the Ryder Cup like it was a major, with one big exception. 

‘We don’t have to pack a suitcase do we, as all the uniforms are going to be over there,’ he said. ‘Socks and underwear. That’s all I got to pack. Other than that, it’s still golf. You still practice at your house, work on your short game, work on your irons, your driver. You just pack differently.’

Talking tactics: Watson sees himself as a calming influence in the American camp

As for the Tour Championship, the final leg of the FedEx Cup play-offs, Watson is one of five players — the others are Chris Kirk, Billy Horschel, Rory McIlroy and Hunter Mahan — in control of their own destiny. If any wins this event, with its $1.44m (£895,000) first prize, they will walk away with the $10m (£6.2m) FedEx bonus.

Watson gave short shrift to those players moaning about fatigue, at the end of a run of six events in seven weeks. ‘You should be energized if you’ve got the chance to take home $11.44 million,’ he said.

‘How many chances are you going to get to do that in your lifetime?’

It was one more good answer in a press conference full of them. Go Bubba, as they say in these parts.
