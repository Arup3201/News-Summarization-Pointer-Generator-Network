Jon Huntsman's palatial ski house in Park City, Utah is for sale - and the asking price is almost $50million.

The extraordinarily wealthy father of former Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman Jr admitted that he has ‘always wanted the biggest and the best’ so the listing pictures of his house may come as little surprise.

The 22,000 square feet estate in the exclusive ski resort boasts 12 bedrooms, 16 bathrooms, a formal dining room that seats 20, an indoor pool, a fitness centre, a game room and a media room.

And the Utah property, which also 
includes a 22-car garage and a waterfall in the extensive grounds, can 
be snapped up for $49.5 million.

Jon Huntman Sr., who has an estimated net worth of almost a billion, down from several billion, is not prepared to budge on the property’s price tag.

‘I don’t need the money; it’s the fact that it’s just a beautiful place. It’s really one of a kind for somebody who wants a beautiful mountain retreat,’ said Mr Huntsman, who made his billions in the chemicals industry.

The house was initially built as a mountain retreat for Mr Huntsman’s nine children and their families, but it was only used occasionally over the years.

Visitors welcome: The house sleeps 44 in its 12 bedrooms and 2 bunk-rooms

Bath-time: Huntsman's children and grandchildren enjoyed the use of 16 bathrooms

They would have certainly had plenty of space in the home which has a library and several children’s playrooms.

As well as 12 luxurious bedrooms the residence has two bunk-rooms with 10 bunk beds each, which allows 44 people to comfortably sleep there.

The residence has also hosted several world leaders, including former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said Mr. Huntsman.

Prime location: The 63-acre estate sits among pine trees in Upper Deer Valley

Stunning: There is a 22-car garage, fitness centre, media room and library

Retreat: The home served as a bolt hole for the Huntsman family

‘At the time I built it, I was worth 
several billion dollars and I wanted to build a home that was the most 
exclusive in America,’ said Mr. Huntsman, who estimates he put more than
$100 million into the home and the furnishings.

The industrialist added that he spends $1 million a year on upkeeping the lavish property, which took three years to build using reclaimed timber from nearby Yellowstone National Park.

Dip in: the extravagant property boasts an indoor pool and a fitness centre

The grounds are a mix of natural and 
manicured landscaping with a one-mile trail and a private pond and 
waterfall. ‘It would be impossible to replicate,’ said Mr. Huntsman of 
the property. ‘It’s one of the great homes in the United States—if not 
the world.’

Mr. Huntsman purchased the property through a limited liability company in the late 1980s, according to public records.

The estate was first offered through a different brokerage in April 2009 as a 64-acre property for $55 million and the listing was later reduced to $42.8 million with about four fewer acres.

Summit Sotheby’s International Realty listed the home and 62 acres in March 2011 with a higher asking price of $49.5 million.

Mr Huntsman and his wife Karen live primarily in Idaho, where they are building a resort.
