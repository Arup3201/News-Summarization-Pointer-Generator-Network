The husband of a California mother accused of stabbing to death her three young daughters has spoken out in her defense, saying that his wife's undiagnosed postpartum depression was to blame for the tragedy.

Carol Coronado, 30, has pleaded not guilty to murder charges in the deaths of her  children, Sophia, 3, Yazmine, 1, and two-month-old Xenia. The Torrance, California, woman, is also accused of trying to kill her own mother after stabbing her daughters May 20.

The mother of three was taken to a mental hospital after she tried to take her own life by stabbing herself in the chest, according to police.

Carol Coronado's defense team has retained the services of a psychologist who will examine her for any signs of postpartum depression.

'I'm not a doctor but I know for a fact that was that disease, and it wasn't my wife,' Rudy Coronado told NBC Los Angeles Thursday.

The grieving father revealed that there had been many warning signs before the murders, but he did not know how to read them.

‘That's the reason why we need to bring awareness to [postpartum depression] because I was never educated on nothing like this,’ Mr Coronado said. ‘I didn't have a clue.’

He added that if it were not for the psychosis, his wife would not have hurt anyone 'in a million years.' Rudy Coronado confided that he has been struggling to come to terms with the loss of his girls over the past month and a half.

‘It doesn't get easier by the day, it gets a little more harder,’ he said.

But even as he continued mourning his daughters, Coronado vehemently defended his wife, describing her as a 'great woman.'

‘She doesn't deserve to be where she's at,’ he said.

The 30-year-old mother of three has never been diagnosed with, or treated for, postpartum depression.

However,
 the family have set up the Coronado Angel Fund to raise awarenss of the
 mental health issue affecting many new mothers. 

According
 to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey, 8 to 19 per 
cent of women reported having frequent postpartum depressive symptoms.

The
 devastated Rudy Coronado had previously told MailOnline: 'I don’t know 
why the hell this happened, she killed my babies man, she killed my 
babies,' as tears streamed down his face.

'It was 
like a demon possessed,' he continued. 'She was a girl with a good career ahead of her, I
 just don’t know why it happened. If I knew why it happened, it would 
answer all my questions.’

The girls' godfather, John Carrion, told the Daily Breeze in May: '[Rudy] loved her. He is concerned for her. He understands what happened, but he is adamant whatever happened wasn’t her. She needs help.'

Carol 
Coronado's mother Julie Piercey first discovered the children's 
butchered bodies covered in blood lying lifeless in the bed at around 
5pm on May 20. The accused killer is said by investigators to have then 
gone at the woman with a knife.

'Oh my God!' Piercey is said to have screamed before wrestling the knife from the hands of her blood-spattered daughter, sources told the Daily Breeze. Husband Rudy was outside working on his car when the killings occurred.

Police
 said Mrs Coronado was found naked and holding a knife after reportedly 
trying to cut her own wrists and stabbing herself in the chest. Several 
knives were recovered at a grisly scene.

'The babies were on the bed,' Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Coleman said.'And
 not in a haphazard fashion, they were placed on the bed, so how and 
where they were killed, we're going to have to figure that out.'

Sheriff's
 deputies took the mother, who was naked except for a blanket, to a 
patrol car and she was then placed in an ambulance, Madrid said.

Mrs
 Coronado joined the U.S. Army after high school but only spent a few 
months in the service before being released due to an injury, Coleman 
said.

Police have not released a motive for the murders. Coronado's mother and her husband were home at the time
