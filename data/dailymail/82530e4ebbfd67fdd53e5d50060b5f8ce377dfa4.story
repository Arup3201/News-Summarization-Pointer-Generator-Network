A senior midwife in an Irish hospital told an Indian woman her dying baby could not be terminated because 'it's a Catholic thing', an inquest heard today.

Mrudula Vasealli described the agony of her friend Savita Halappanavar's drawn-out miscarriage after doctors at Galway University Hospital said the foetus could not be saved.

She was at the hospital a week later when Mrs Halappanavar died of septicaemia, and told the hearing that the woman's husband Praveen collapsed and vomited in the lobby after he heard the news.

Ms Vasealli told Galway Coroner's Court that her friend pleaded for the baby's heartbeat to be stopped when it became clear the child could not survive.

'She said, the midwife, "We do not do that here dear. It's a Catholic thing,"' she said. 'The nurses were lovely, they took good care of her. It's the system that was wrong.'

Mrs Halappanavar died on October 28 last year at the age of 31, sparking international outcry against Ireland's strict abortion laws which some say contributed to her death.

'Somebody said Praveen collapsed,' Ms Vasealli said. 'He was brought to the lobby. He was vomiting there. He couldn't walk.'

Mr Halappanavar previously told an inquest that his Hindu wife asked for a termination three times before she finally delivered her dead baby daughter.

Consultant obstetrician Katherine Astbury has denied his claims that she refused a termination on the grounds that Ireland is 'a Catholic country'.

Ms Vasealli spent the day with Mrs Halappanavar five days before her death as Praveen drove his parents-in-law to Dublin Airport.

She said in her statement: 'Savita was very upset again because the foetal heartbeat was still there.

'She cried, saying: "What kind of mother am I waiting for my own baby to stop its heartbeat? I'm losing it, I'm losing it terribly."'

She told coroner Ciaran MacLoughlin that her friend wept continuously as a midwife checked again for a heartbeat.

'We both, Savita and I, asked if there was a possibility of saving the baby because there was still a heartbeat after three days,' she said.

'Savita said, "Can you please save it. If you can't do something to stop the foetal heartbeat, I can't take this waiting for the baby to die."'

It is unclear who the midwife on duty at the time was, but hospital officials said their 'best guess' was that it was clinical midwife manager Ann Maria Burke, who will now be called to testify at the inquest.

Mrs Halappanavar carried the baby until October 24, but by that night she was in critical condition in intensive care, where she died four days later from septicaemia.

Earlier family friend Dr Rupanjali Kundu, a senior house officer in obstetrics at the hospital, said she visited Mrs Halappanavar on the Monday and Wednesday when she noticed a significant change in her health.

'She was lying on the bed and she was unable to speak that much,' she said. 'She looked really ill. It was a significant change.'

The inquest continues.
