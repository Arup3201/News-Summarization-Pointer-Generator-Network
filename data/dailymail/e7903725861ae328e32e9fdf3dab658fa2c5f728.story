Police fear they will never get the chance to quiz the alleged killer and gay lover of a British man who moved to the U.S. and reinvented himself as a talk show host in Louisiana.

Scott Rogers, 52, was found dead in his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana last week, just one day before he was due to appear in front of a Grand Jury who was investigating whether lied on documents he lodged to foster two children. 

Police in Baton Rouge believe Rogers was shot by his son-in-law and lover Mathew Hodgkinson, who then attempted to take his own life, but survived.

Iberville Parish Sheriff Brett Stassi said his officers want to question Hodgkinson but medics have told him the situation is 'grim'. 

He said: 'They originally told me the next 48 to 72 hours would be very important and there being no change (in his condition) is not a good sign. 

'At this time it looks grim that we would ever have the chance to arrest him.

'I am going to meet with my investigators on Tuesday morning and see which direction we are going in.'

It is understood that Hodgkinson had testified at a Grand Jury in Baton Rouge before he went home to Rogers. 

Hodgkinson's wife, Kimmy Ann Scott Rogers, who is also Rogers' biological daughter, was testifying to the Grand Jury at the time of her father's murder. 

Investigators believe that Hodgkinson married his daughter so he would not be deported from the United States and continued his affair with the 52-year-old former dance teacher.

Hodgkinson is currently being treated in Our Lady of the Lake Regional Hospital where his condition is described as critical. 

He is understood to have suffered a life-threatening brain injury.  

Sheriff Stassi said his investigators were looking into the circumstances of Rogers' departure from the UK after he was cleared of child-sex allegations.

These allegations were never revealed to US authorities when he was in the process of fostering two children. 

Rogers had already adopted a ten-year-old boy and was in the process of fostering a two-year-old child when authorities were made aware of Rogers' past problems. 

According to Sheriff Stasi: 'The noose was tightening. That’s why the other guy (the third man in the house) said they had talked about a potential group suicide.

'He decided that wasn’t the way his life was going to end.'

Hodgkinson survived the suicide attempt and is in a coma. He was a former student of Rogers' in the U.K. and his lover, and he had married Rogers' daughter Kimmy in order to be able to stay in the U.S., WBRZ reported.

Rogers, who was well-known locally as the host of the feel-good weekend show 'Around Town', was found dead under covers in bed.

Beside him was a suicide note apparently written by Hodgkinson, reading: 'They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too.'

The note was an apparent reference to troubles they had been experiencing with authorities in regards to Rogers' children earlier this month.

He was under investigation for fraud and the state had taken custody of his two kids - a 10-year-old adopted son and a two-year-old boy he was in the process of adopting - The Advocate reported.

His show had also been canceled on Monday, WBRZ reported.

Iberville Parish Sheriff Brett Stassi told the Times-Picayune that the marriage between Hodgkinson and Rogers' daughter was a sham to keep him in the country. She was reportedly testifying before a federal grand jury when her father was killed.

As a result, Stassi said Rogers' home had been the scene of a 'bunch of stress' in the past several weeks.

'It looked like a murder and failed attempted suicide,' Stassi said. 'It's been topsy-turvy at this residence... We responded to a couple of calls. It's been a high stress environment for this family and looks like it culminated in this.'

Rogers had been involved in three child molestation cases before he moved to the U.S. in the 90s, Stassi said. He was cleared in one, but two others are still pending overseas, he said.

'There were some other accusations that come up that were not totally resolved when he left England,' Stassi told WBRZ. 'I think the past history was catching up.'

Rogers, then known as Richard Scott-Rogers, founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983.

The school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County Council bosses, who in 1995 warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending their children to the school.

On Thursday two men, appearing anonymously on a Louisiana radio show, alleged that Scott Rogers had sexually abused them as young boys in the UK.

One of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at the dance academy, claimed to have been intimately involved with Rogers from the age of 13. He said that the encounters 'increased in frequency' until he was 18. The other alleged victim described him as a 'monster'.

Rogers, was acquitted of child molestation charges involving a 13-year-old boy in 1993, according to the Bury Free Press.

Parents told the paper about 'sleepovers' Rogers would have with some of his young students, during which he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags'.

In 1995, Suffolk County Council voiced concerns about 'a senior member' of the academy following a High Court case in 1993.

In a statement released at the time, the council warned parents of an 'unhealthy atmosphere' at the academy and compared it to that of 'a religious or supposedly religious cult'.

It said: 'There was also considerable anxiety felt as to levels of intimacy that existed between the senior member and pupils.'

At the time head teacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cult-style brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the performing arts. Some of our pupils have moved on to appear in the West End theatre and on television.

'People are still coming here for classes from all over Suffolk. We are not involved in any cult activities and to say we are is ridiculous.'
