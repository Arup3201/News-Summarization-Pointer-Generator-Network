Teachers banned an exotic animal expert from a school after fears were raised over health and safety.

Reptile specialist Rob Louth was due to present a workshop to a group of children during half-term at St George’s Academy in Sleaford, Lincolnshire.

But he was stunned when panicking staff rang him five minutes before his presentation began and ordered him to remove the creatures from the school premises.

Mr Louth, who recently won an award for his nationwide animal talks, was forced to quickly show the 
devastated children the exotic creatures in their travel boxes before taking
 them out of the school.

The 35-year-old had planned to show a tarantula, lizard, snakes, meerkats and skunks to the excited young carers in his 90 minute workshop on October 23.

A carer’s organisation had booked the school buildings to give the youngsters - who care for their disabled or seriously ill parents - a well-deserved treat.

Mr Louth said: 'It’s health and safety gone mad. I’ve done displays in schools, shopping centres and parks, more or less anywhere.

'I did a national tour of shopping centres with Skoda on a promotional tour with my animals and you can’t get much more of a health and safety nightmare than a shopping centre. But they accepted me and my licences.

'These kids had come from all over for this workshop and I’d been booked to be there for some time.

'The carers group had hired the school to put on a series of workshops for them as a treat.'

Mr Louth has given talks about his animals around the country, and recently won an award for his work.

He added: 'I was in and had got all the animals there set up ready to go but five minutes before I was due to start I got a phone call saying no reptiles were allowed.

'I spoke to a senior member of staff on the phone and said can they give a reason but she just said no. Then I said well if I can’t show the reptiles I will just show the invertebrates and mammals’ but then she said no animals at all.

'I decided to stay as long as I could and keep the animals in the boxes so the kids could at least see something and I talked to them about the animals.

'But I had to pack the animals away and leave with a group of deserving kids sat at their desks with their cameras out ready. It was ridiculous.The kids were gutted.'

The carer’s organisation had booked Mr Louth to do his hour-and-a-half workshops on Wednesday, October 23 and Thursday, October 24.

But because of the school’s ban, he was forced to walk the children to a local youth centre and do a rushed workshop on the Thursday.

Mr Louth, from Ruskington, Lincolnshire, added: “This is what I do for a living. I am fully insured.

'I’ve got every licence under the sun. I’m even licensed to work with dangerous animals like a cobra or alligator.

'I’m just really disappointed for the kids. At the end of the day they missed out for no real reason.'
