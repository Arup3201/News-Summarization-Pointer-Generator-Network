David Eden Fett (pictured) was charged with multiple felonies after allegedly swinging a hatchet at his mother

A Florida man  allegedly threw his 70-year-old mother on the ground, beat her and swung a hatchet so close to her head  she felt the wind whistle across her face - all because she asked him to turn his music down.

David Eden Fett, 47, was charged with multiple felonies after police responded to a call on Wednesday evening and found him standing outside a house.

Fett, of Gainesville, told Deputy Joel Morris of the Alachua County Sheriff's Office  that his mother was inside the home.

When Deputy Morris entered the house with Fett following along behind him, he found the victim wrapped up in a blanket looking 'very afraid'.

He reported she repeatedly told him 'don't leave me'.

Deputy Morris added the victim was 'shaking uncontrollably' and seemed 'very nervous'.

The victim told Deputy Morris that her son was intoxicated, The Gainesville Sun reported. 

When another deputy removed Fett from the home, the woman told Deputy Morris her son 'became angry' after she asked him to turn down his music and swung a hatchet at her. 

He then allegedly tossed the hatchet away, threw her to the ground and 'struck her about ten times in the neck, stomach and legs.'

She went on to reveal that Fett only left her alone after he sat on her while pinching her nose and covering her mouth. 

Fett, who was 'speaking irrationally' and having 'a difficult time staying on topic' said his mother was experiencing delusions and that he only swung the hatchet so he could 'get rid of it'.

He was charged with aggravated battery on a person 65 years of age or older and domestic battery by strangulation.

The ACSO also charged him with displaying a weapon during a felony and committing an act that could cause death.
