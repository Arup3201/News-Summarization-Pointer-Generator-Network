Jeremy Clarkson has denied posting a photograph of an 'entrance to slope' sign on Twitter following a backlash from his 4million followers. 

The Top Gear presenter, who was accused of using the term 'slope' to describe an Asian man while filming the programe earlier this year, said he did not compose the tweet which appeared on his account yesterday.

The photograph, which has since been deleted, appeared on the 54-year-old's account accompanied with the caption: 'This is just obscene'. 

The photograph, which has since been removed, was posted from Mr Clarkson's Twitter account yesterday 

It was retweeted more than 400 times before being removed from the social media site, and was published by the Daily Mirror today. 

Once it had been taken down from the site, Mr Clarkson told followers: 'Actually that last tweet wasn't from me.'

He then  suggested someone had hacked into his phone, writing: 'It seems you can access a fingerprint iPhone using a number code. Must stay across these things.'

In March the presenter was accused of using the word 'slope' in a racially offensive way to describe an Asian man while filming an episode of Top Gear in Burma. 

At one point in the programme, aired by BBC Two, Mr Clarkson stands with colleague Richard Hammond looking out over a makeshift bridge they built on the River Kwai. 

The presenter can be heard saying: 'That is a proud moment… but there’s a slope on it,' as a Burmese man walks towards them.

Mr Clarkson denied posting the photograph himself, suggesting someone else used his iPhone to do so 

The presenter was accused of using the term in a racially offensive way to describe a Burmese man an episode of Top Gear that was aired in March 

Ofcom ruled the statement was was offensive, slamming the BBC for choosing not to edit out his comments. 

'Jeremy Clarkson used the word "slope" to refer both to an Asian man crossing a bridge, and the incline of the bridge,' it ruled.

Following a barrage of complaints, the programme's executive producer, Andy Wilman, apologised for the use of the term, saying it had been intended as a 'light-hearted word-play joke' and that the team had been unaware the term was considered offensive.

Months later Mr Clarkson was embroiled in another racial row after being accused of using the word 'n*****' on camera. 

He apologised for any offence caused, posting an apology video online in which he admitted to being told by BBC bosses that he was 'drinking at the last chance saloon'. 

Mr Clarkson was not available for comment this evening. The BBC said that it was not commenting.
