The female mind has always been a complete mystery to most men and their enigmatic thoughts and actions almost impossible to decode - until now.

Finally the closely-held secret of whether a woman fancies someone has been exposed and experts have found it is all in the eyes.

A new study looked at how and where women glance after a man makes initial eye contact and found this shows him all he needs to know about his chances of romance.

Great news! Life coach Ali Campbell says that if a woman looks down and sweeps the floor with her eyes, left, or looks to the side and then back it is a sure sign she fancies a man

What happens in the 45 seconds after 
meeting makes it crystal clear if love is in the air or whether the
hapless male suitor will get the cold shoulder, experts have said.

About turn: A woman looking sideways was often thought to be a rejection but research has found that in fact she is attracted to you

Life coach Ali Campbell says in his book 'More than Just Sex' that the look men want to see is her looking down and then moving her eyes in a sweeping motion across the floor because it almost certainly means that she is attracted to you.

This glance means that she is checking her internal emotions, in short, she likes you but is working out how much.

'It's the 
holy grail of looks,' he said.

'If a guy can pick up on that he has a sure-fire way to work out if she is interested.'

And in a complete reversal the 
disinterested, shy or bashful look sideways a woman often gives is not 
the brush-off most men thought it was.

It is in fact the opposite.

If a woman looks away for up to 45 
seconds and then stares you 
straight in the eye it is another sure sign that she is interested 
because she is thinking hard about whether you are a suitable partner.

'Most guys have the idea that if they make eye contact and she looks away she is not interested. But she will look away, that's inevitable. That's what happens when we think to ourselves and also consider our feelings,' Mr Campbell told MailOnline.

'I have interviewed literally hundreds of women and too many men concentrate on having the right car, the right watch, the right whatever. But it is rubbish, all the women I spoke to told me they are just interested in what men are like inside.

'What I am doing for guys is to make sure they know there is someone out there who is interested in you. The important thing is to show who you really are.'

But of course with good news there is 
bad and this book has also given men the clearest indications yet about 
whether they have no chance of love with someone they like. Â 

If
after the man makes eye contact she instantly looks over his head or 
stares straight back at him it is almost certainly curtains.

Forget it: An aggressive stare, left, or looking up or over a man's head is not good news and experts say a man is best to turn his attention elsewhere

These two 'aggressive' reactions mean the man should back off quickly and turn his attentions elsewhere to avoid further embarrassment.

'You do not want her to stare you out or look over your head. That's a bad sign,' he said.

Mr Campbell's study has also found women 
give off other signals that men should look out for on a date or when 
they meet someone for the first time.

Secret: The book has revealed a whole new world to men which they can use to know if a date is going well or not

Whether she is right or left handed she will use her dominant wrist to point at you if she likes you.

Also if she touches her hair she is attracted to you and if she twirls the ends then she really likes you.

But an instant stare into a man's eyes or over his head on meeting is very bad news for a suitor
