Premier League footballer Danny Simpson tried to throttle the mother of his three-year-old daughter, a court has heard.

Simpson, who plays for Leicester City, appeared in court accused of assaulting Stephanie Ward 'after police saw him with his hands around her throat during a struggle' at her home.

The footballer, from Eccles, Greater Manchester, pleaded not guilty to the charge of assault by beating. 

Police were called out to Miss Ward's address in Worsley, Greater Manchester, after a 999 call was disconnected on December 29, prosecutor Kate Gaskell told Manchester Magistrates' Court.

She said: 'When officers attended the door was open and they could hear the sounds of a struggle. 

'When police get in they see the defendant with his hands around Miss Ward's throat standing over her.  

'She has not given a statement and the police are yet to confirm whether she is on board. It is the police officer who sees the assault. There is also an officer who gives hearsay evidence. There are no applications for bad character.'

Max Shepherd, representing Simpson, 28, at the pre-trial hearing, requested a trial on any Wednesday after May 11. 

A trial was set for May 20 at Manchester Magistrates' Court. 

Former Manchester United star Simpson was bailed on the conditions he did not to enter Miss Ward's home or anywhere she is living. 

He is also not allowed to meet Miss Ward and any contact to be made concerning their daughter, Skye, must be done through solicitors.
