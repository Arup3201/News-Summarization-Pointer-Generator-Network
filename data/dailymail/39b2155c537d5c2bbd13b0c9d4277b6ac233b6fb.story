This is the terrifying moment a prolific robber grabbed a woman from behind and ripped a gold necklace from around her neck as part of a £20,000 street robbery rampage.

In the shocking footage, Ralf Dautzenberg, 22, is captured on CCTV jogging up to the woman in broad daylight before wrenching the jewellery and fleeing from the scene in Hayes, west London.

The brutal attack, which took place in March, was one of 12 that Dautzenberg carried out on defenceless Asian women during a six-month crime spree.

This is the terrifying moment a prolific robber grabbed a woman from behind and ripped a gold necklace from her neck as part of a £20,000 street robbery rampage in London 

His aim was to steal high-value gold necklaces, before selling them on for cash. His eldest victim was 72.

After he was arrested, officers discovered a sickening photo of Dautzenberg posing with a huge wad of cash - the proceeds of his crimes. Just one necklace was found and returned to the owner.

Dautzenberg, from Canning Town, north London, was today jailed for six years at Isleworth Crown Court after pleading guilty to 11 counts of robbery and one count of theft near his home between January and June this year.

Ralf Dautzenberg, 22, from Canning Town, north London, carried out 12 attacks during his six-month crime spree 

Detectives investigating the robberies revealed how Dautzenberg would approach his victims from behind, before grabbing their necks and tearing off their jewellery. 

The Met Police said he even resorted to violence on several occasions, punching one elderly victim on the head and knocking them to the pavement. 

He would then remove or change his clothes in a bid to avoid being caught.  

The attacks only stopped when he was arrested by a police officer. 

Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Barry Wilcock, said: 'Dautzenberg went to great lengths to identify and target vulnerable and innocent members of the public and avoid police detection by removing or changing his clothing immediately after offending as he fled the scene.  

'It became clear that the violence he was using was escalating, with defenceless elderly victims being punched in the face for their jewellery.

'Every resource available to us was utilised, from forensic opportunities to intelligence and covert operations.'

Police also told how Dautzenberg would rely on public transport to select a victim. 

He would sit on a bus or train sizing up the woman and jewellery she was wearing, before following them on foot and attacking them a short time after. 

He added: 'Had it not been for the sheer tenacity demonstrated in the pursuit and detention of Dautzenberg, I am in no doubt that he would have gone on to cause significant and possibly life changing injuries to innocent and unsuspecting members of the public.'

One victim, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: 'This person made me vulnerable. This crime made me feel scared in my home. 

'I wake at night having nightmares and images with flashbacks of what he did, I feel scared to walk on my own anywhere as he robbed me on the main road 11am.

'I came back to my sister's after the incident hysterically shaking and crying, in front of my two young children, my eldest is six and has never seen me like that.

'She still remembers and asks questions about the incident, and why he wanted to hurt me.

'My life has changed and his actions leave me sleepless at night. My necklace was given to me by my grandmother to bring me luck she lives in India and I may not see her again.

'I'm happy that he's caught as I would not like anyone to have to go through this or feel so vulnerable and scared.' 

After sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Richard Turner praised the team which investigated Dautzenberg's crimes.

He said: 'I would like to place on record my recognition of the excellent detective work that went into this investigation.  

'The dedicated enquiry team worked together with the Crown Prosecution Service to bring this violent offender to justice with the strongest and most compelling evidence.

'In total, Hillingdon CID investigated 25 individual offences of street robbery linked solely to Dautzenberg. This crime series came to a complete halt following his arrest and apprehension.' 

After the attack in March this year, Dautzenberg then flees from the scene, leaving the woman shaken and bruised

The brutal attack was one of 12 that Dautzenberg carried out on defenceless Asian women between January and June, mainly in a bid to steal high-value gold necklaces. His eldest victim was 72

He added: 'Combating Asian gold theft remains a high priority for our policing team and we work tirelessly to support victims of violence and robbery through every stage of investigation.

'We want our community to feel safe and confident in any environment, but also remain aware of any potential dangers and immediately report any suspicious activity to the police.

'Every victim has undergone a horrific ordeal at the hands of Dautzenberg which will never be forgotten, and I hope that today's sentence will bring some closure and reassurance that this opportunist attacker is now behind bars.'  

Dautzenberg sold most of the stolen items but police managed to find some jewellery when they searched his home
