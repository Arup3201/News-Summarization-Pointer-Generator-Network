After raking in a signing bonus of $2million four years ago, a Blue Jays pitching prospect immediately splurged on his dream car.

But for Daniel Norris, 21, it was both a car and a home when he purchased 'Shaggy', a 1978 mustard yellow, Volkswagen Westfalia van that he lives in during the off season.

As a love of the outdoors runs his family, the left-handed pitcher from Johnson City, Tennessee spends his time camping in mountains and driving on the open road when he is not playing baseball.

Norris, who made his major-league debut in September, even started the tradition of driving a 1,100-kilometer trip from his hometown to Dunedin, Florida where he and his teammates train in the Spring, according to the National Post.

It is during long trips like this on the open road that helps him find peace within.

He said: 'I love my teammates and family but I'm not the kind of person who likes to be around a ton of people. I'm a thinker, I like to be alone with my thoughts.

'When I'm out there, it's just me, Shaggy and God and I can really connect with myself. It's very peaceful.'

He has documented his travels on the road on Twitter, where he posts pictures of himself cooking and getting ready for bed as the sun sets. 

The 6 foot 2 player found Shaggy, which was named after the Scooby-Doo character, through his dad's friend as it was not initially for sale.

After convincing the owner to let him buy it, Norris purchased the van and added solar panels and a bed, according to GrindTV.

And for Norris, his unique splurge comes in line behind a trend of other decisions and traits that have led him on a road less traveled, which has seemed to remain a theme in his life.

He said that he has always been different from wearing 'weird' shoes in high school to not ever talking that much.

His background has also been rooted in the outdoors, and in his childhood, he was taught how to live a simple life.

As he was growing up, his parents and two older sisters would go rock climbing, camping, bike riding on the weekends, and eventually he picked up kayaking and backpacking during the first two off seasons his pro baseball career.

When he has time to travel on the open road, Norris, who can throw a fastball that can reach 95mph, does not have a particular plan.

But his time includes surfing, hiking, self-reflection and tucking into the overhead bunk bed at night for bed.
