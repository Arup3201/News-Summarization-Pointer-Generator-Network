As chairman of America's most profitable bank, he took home $19million in compensation last year.

Now, a Wells Fargo employee has asked CEO John Stumpf for a pay rise - for everyone at the firm.

Tyrel Oates, 30, sent an email to the multi-millionaire businessman - and copied in a staggering 200,000 co-workers  - in a bid to help end income inequality.

In the letter, addressed to 'Mr Stumpf', he suggested that the 60-year-old used some of the bank's record-high $20.9billion profits to give everyone a $10,000 raise.

For the San Francisco-based firm's approximate 300,000 employees - including the ones cc'd in the email - this would total around $3billion, still leaving more than $17billion in corporate profits, he said.

Mr Oates, a customer service worker at the bank's Portland, Oregon, branch, also highlighted the $19.3million that Mr Stumpf received in total compensation last year - a figure confirmed by Forbes.

He told Mr Stumpf, whose net worth is an estimated $50million: 'Last year, you had pulled in over $19million, more than most of the employees will see in our lifetimes.

'It is understood that your position carries a lot of weight and responsibility; however, with a base salary of $2.8million and bonuses equating to $4million, [it] is alone one of the main arguments of income inequality

Speaking out: Mr Oates, a customer service worker at the bank's Portland, Oregon, branch, also highlighted the $19.3million that Mr Stumpf received in total compensation last year - a figure confirmed by Forbes

'My proposal is take $3billion dollars, just a small fraction of what Wells Fargo pulls in annually, and raise every employees annual salary by $10,000 dollars.

'Think, as well, of the positive publicity in a time of extreme consumer skepticism towards banks.

'By doing this, Wells Fargo will not only help to make its people, its family, more happy, productive, and financially stable, it will also show the rest of the United States, if not the world that, yes big corporations can have a heart other than philanthropic endeavors.'

He added: 'To all of my fellow team members who receive a copy of this email. Though Wells Fargo does not allow the formation of unions, this does not mean we cannot stand united.' 

Encouraging others: He wrote: 'To all of my fellow team members who receive a copy of this email. Though Wells Fargo does not allow the formation of unions, this does not mean we cannot stand united'

Mr Oates's letter, sporting the subject line 'income inequality', was later uploaded to social networking site Reddit, where many users congratulated the employee for speaking out.

However, the worker did acknowledge that the company provided some 'pretty good benefits, as well as discretionary profit sharing for those who partake in our 401k program'.

Despite the letter's publicity, Mr Oates, who processes requests from Wells Fargo customers seeking to prevent debt-collection calls, said he is still employed by the bank.

Successful: Mr Stumpf, who became CEO of Wells Fargo in 2010, has an estimated net worth of $50million

He also told the Charlotte Observer that he has no concerns about being fired and has even received numerous thank-you emails from co-workers.

'I’m not worried about losing my job over this,' said Mr Oates, who has worked at the bank for nearly seven years and earns just over $15 an hour, according to AOL.com. 

A spokesman for Wells Fargo - the most profitable bank in 2013 according to MarketWatch - told the newspaper the firm provides 'market competitive' compensation combining base pay with benefits.

Despite his tremendous success as a businessman, Mr Stumpf himself had humble beginnings, having grown up on a dairy farm in Minnesota.
