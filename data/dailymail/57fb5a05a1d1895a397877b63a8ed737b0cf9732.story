An engineer has turned his back on his trade and set out across Europe to learn 33 more instead.

Jan Lachner, 25, arrived in the UK this week to come face-to-face with sharks as a diving cleaner for the 31st stop on his trip.

Mr Lachner, who began his project 18 months ago as a fisherman in Malta, said: 'I've taken on many challenges but probably not many as nerve-wracking as this.'

He will spend a week working at the Sea Life Centre in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, cleaning out the giant aquariums housing sharks, turtles and crabs.

The qualified aeronautical engineer from Paris has spent £10,000 on his Euro-Jobs project so far, often working for nothing.

He has tried his hand at teaching flamenco in Seville, Spain, taking over the radio airwaves in Belgium, pulling pints on New Year's Eve in Dublin, and brewing beer in the Czech Republic - and still has jobs in Portugal and Italy to tick off his list.

Mr Lachner, who is half German and half French, said: 'Before this project I had a placement
at Rolls-Royce, I was struck by the number of people who have spent 
their entire working lives with that one company.

'I looked around one day and thought they can be in the same profession for 
years and never know anything different.

'I'm sure most of those people were very happy, but I suddenly realised 
that I wanted to know what else is out there before eventually returning
to the aeronautical industry.'

'I have a natural curiosity and I wanted to show that you can do anything regardless of your nationality.'

And the trip has turned up some surprises.

'There were jobs that I did I didn't 
think I would be good at but actually it went very well,' he said.

He also armed himself to be a park ranger in Finland

'I've been asked
back if I ever want to be an estate agent in Luxembourg.

'Highlights for me would be being a beer brewer in the Czech Republic, a photographer in Iceland, a barman in Dublin and an archaeologist in Greece.'

Darren Cook, senior marine biologist at the Sea Life Centre, said: 'Jan contacted us as he was interested about diving in the tanks.

'We wanted to help him out as much as we could so we contacted the company we usually use to clean the tanks then arranged for him to spend the week doing the day-to-day jobs we normally do.'

HE'S STILL GOT TWO COUNTRIES TO DO...
