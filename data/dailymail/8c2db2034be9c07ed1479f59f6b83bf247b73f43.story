Hull will enter the Europa League in the third qualifying round on July 31 along with European giants Lyon and PSV Eindhoven.

Their tie is unlikely to be glamorous though — they are likely to face the likes of JK Sillamae Kalev from Estonia, FC Shirak from Armenia or Sioni Bolnisi from Georgia.

Location: Hull play their first game in July, in all likelihood a long way from Wembley, where they played last

Back again: Spurs went out to Benfica in the last 16 this year. They will start in the fourth qualifying round

Tottenham, who finished sixth in the Premier League, join a round a later for the play-offs while Everton join the competition in the group stages.

As for lucky Manchester United, they can enjoy Thursday nights free of the Europa League.  Mr Van Gaal will be pleased.
