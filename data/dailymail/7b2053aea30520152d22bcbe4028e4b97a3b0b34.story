A mother-of-four had told of how she cheated death when a fully grown deer fell through the windshield of her minivan.

Heidi Conner was coming to the end of an eight hour road trip with her children when the deer slammed into her car after falling from a highway overpass near Barrington, Illinois.

The adult female deer came through Ms Conner’s windshield as she was driving more than 70mph, but miraculously none of her children were hurt.

SCROLL FOR VIDEO

Shock: Heidi Conner was driving her four children in a minivan on the interstate, when the deer came in through her windshield, near Barrington, Illinois

Ms Conner even managed to drive across three lines of traffic on the westbound Interstate 90 near Barrington with the dear next to her.

She has a sore shoulder and some bruising, but somehow, she is otherwise unhurt.

‘I’m driving, everything was fine. Boom, and I have a deer lying next to me in my car,’ she told CBS2 Chicago.

‘If it had been one inch to the left, it would have been dead center. I wouldn’t have been able to control the car. And one inch to the right, it would have killed my son.’

Ms Conner’s children are completely unharmed, apart from the shock.

Lucky: Ms Conner managed to steer though three lanes of traffic on the westbound Interstate 90 near Barrington - with the dead deer in her car

Incredible: Ms Conner's children are all unharmed, and she has a sore elbow, but other than that - the family escaped without injuries despite the unwelcome overpass guest

According to witnesses the deer fell or jumped from the Illinois 72 overpass onto the highway.

First on the scene was Illinois Police State Trooper Justin Novarro, who said it was unlike anything he had ever seen before.

‘Never in my career have I seen anything like this,’ he told the TV station.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates there are approximately 1.5 million auto deer collisions per year.

Illinois has the third most deer hits per year, only outdone by Pennsylvania and Michigan.
