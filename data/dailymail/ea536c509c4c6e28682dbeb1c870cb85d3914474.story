Crooked shop manager Tom Humble has avoided jail after stealing more than £23,000 worth of donated mobile phones

An assistant  manager at Vodafone has managed to avoid a jail term after he stole more than £23,000 worth of mobile phones which had been donated to charity.

Tom Humble sold hundreds of the stolen phones online and pocketed the profits during the four year scam.

The mobile phones had been donated at the store in Eastgate Shopping Centre in Basildon, Essex as part of a charity scheme.

Customers were told their donated devices would be recycled with all proceeds going to charity.

Instead, they were stolen by Humble who took 461 phones from the store before selling them on to mobile trading website Mazuma Mobile. 

Humble appeared at Basildon Crown Court yesterday where he was told the only reason he wasn't going to jail was because he had found himself a job and was supporting his family. 

He was handed a 16-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to complete 150 hours of community service.

The 28-year-old, from Westcliff, Essex, had been working as a senior sales advisor on £17,000-a-year at the Vodafone store in the Eastgate Centre in Basildon, Essex, when the thefts began in 2009.

A year later he was promoted to assistant manager but, despite a £6,500 pay rise, he continued to steal from the store's mobile phone recycling bin. 

His thefts were eventually exposed in late 2013 following an internal investigation by Vodafone who then called in Essex Police.

Ian Clift, mitigating, claimed his client had stolen to help support his girlfriend in their new home and had now taken an honest office job in a bid to rebuild his life.

He added: 'His strategy for solving their problems was deeply flawed. 

'He committed this crime with a heavy heart and feels a great deal of shame.'

Sentencing Humble, Recorder Robert Glancy said: 'There are a lot of people in the country who find themselves under financial pressure but they do not resort to thieving from their employer when trusted to run a shop.

'This crime is made worse by the fact you knew the proceeds were going to charity. 

'It is because you have found a job and are the source of support for your family you are not going to prison immediately.'
