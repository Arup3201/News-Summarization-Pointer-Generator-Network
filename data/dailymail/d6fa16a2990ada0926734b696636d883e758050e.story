With his fake dreadlocks than hang all the way to the floor, this toddler could well be the youngest Bob Marley tribute act.

Taking a classy orange and white microphone, two-year-old Myles Kingston-Sadler blasts out Get Up Stand Up while being videoed by a family member.

The toddler lives in Atlanta, Georgia, and his love for reggae has been passed down from his family who have Jamaican, Cuban and Haitian roots.

The boy has certainly got some soul, as he owns the microphone, raising one hand in the air as he feels the music.

He walks off only to grab a guitar, fumbling to hang it around his neck as he receives some encouragement from his audience.

The young performer seems to know all the words as he jams to the classic tune, dancing to the beat.

The YouTube video has had almost 40,000 views, yet it's not the first time the two-year-old has showcased his talents.

Myles has also recorded versions of Rastaman Vibration, Crazy Baldheads and Coming In From The Cold by the iconic musician from Jamaica.
