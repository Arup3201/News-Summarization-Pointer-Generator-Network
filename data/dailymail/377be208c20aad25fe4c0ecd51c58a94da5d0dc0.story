A reformed boozer who spent nine months partying in Magaluf has shed more than stone after ditching her ladette lifestyle to become a fitness fanatic.

Emma Harvey worked as a promo girl in Majorca's party capital, eating nothing but junk food and downing some 300 alcoholic drinks every single week over the course of two summers.

The 23-year-old, from Bromley, London, weighed 15st 4lb when she decided to battle her bulging waistline.

Emma Harvey piled on the pounds after travelling to Magaluf to work as a promo girl, she was drinking three hundred alcoholic drinks a week (left) and gorging on takeaways but has since lost six stone (right)

Emma lost the weight by cutting down her fatty diet and hitting the gym, training five times a week 

Emma became so ashamed of her size 22 body that she began cutting the labels out of her clothes and spent her nights scoffing pizza on the sofa.

Eventually, when tying her own shoe laces left her breathless, Emma decided to give up her boozy, junk-fuelled lifestyle and went on a diet.

Now weighing 9st 2lb and a size 6 to 8, Emma has become a self-confessed fitness addict, swapping greasy takeaways for lean steaks and daily gym sessions.

She's even managed to bag herself a personal trainer boyfriend, Leon Hodge, 34, who she met on a night out. 

Emma says she was spurred on to the lose the weight after she discovered that she was too fat to tie her own shoelaces (pictured left before changing her lifestyle, and right, after)

Emma met her boyfriend Leon Hodge who is a personal trainer on a night out, she says he couldn't believe what she used to look like when she showed him pictures of her former self 

The accountant said: 'During those two summers in Magaluf I was eating absolute rubbish and doing no exercise whatsoever.

'I would wake up at 2pm and have a kebab for breakfast with a shot of tequila.

'The alcohol there is practically free and I was drinking at least 10 glasses of vodka and lemonade and 12 shots of Sambuca a night. I don't think I had a single glass of water while I was out there.'

In April 2011, 5ft 4in tall Emma arrived in Magaluf to get over a bad break-up by throwing herself into the resort's relentless party lifestyle.

Living in the city's main strip, Emma worked as a promo girl, encouraging revellers to visit bars and clubs.

Breakfast: 

(Waking at 2pm) A cheese burger from Burger King with chips and full fat coke

Lunch:

Skipped

Dinner: 

A kebab, pizza, KFC, chips with cheese, Chinese, or curry

Snacks: 

Alcohol and crisps throughout the day (and night)

Alcohol: 

Tequila for breakfast and a pint of beer or cider with lunch. Between 70-100 glasses of vodka or Malibu and lemonade a week, and over 200 shots of Sambuca and Jagerbomb

Breakfast: 

25g Oats with 125ml skimmed milk and one black coffee

Lunch: 

Chicken breast with a jacket sweet potato

Dinner: 

Lean steak with broccoli, carrots and sweetcorn

Snacks: 

Apples, bananas, melon, protein shake, goji berries, or pumpkin seeds

Alcohol:

Emma no longer drinks alcohol and says she can have just as much fun on a night out without it. Now if she goes out she will have a soft drink

She says: 'An average day began with me waking at 2pm. I worked from 8pm till 4am and then partied till 10am.

'Healthy eating wasn't on my mind. I was living off fried chicken, burgers and curries.'

Six months later, those unhealthy eating habits returned with Emma when she arrived back in the UK and she continued to pile on the pounds.

She had left her family home in Milton Keynes a size 10 to 12 and 11st and returned a size 20 and 14st 8lb.

Emma says: 'I didn't care about my weight when I was out there. It was only when I got back to the UK and saw my friends again that I could see the difference.'

Emma has revealed that she didn't realise just how much weight she had put on until she came home

When living in Magaluf Emma would wake up at 2pm and then gorge on takeaways and spend her whole day drinking alcohol, she would even have tequila for breakfast (pictured left and right before the weight loss)

The following summer, still unsatisfied with life at home, Emma returned to Magaluf. Her second spell as a promo girl only lasted three months, and back in the UK she continued to put on weight.

But it soon began to take a tole on her confidence. Becoming conscious of her size, Emma shunned socialising for lonely nights on sofa, where she would over-eat takeaways.

By December 2012, all the partying, boozing and gorging on junk food had taken its toll on Emma's body.

Weighing a hefty 15st 4lb, she realised it was time to make a change.

She says: 'My family were walking to the pub and I was about to join them. Only, when I tried to tie my shoes, my stomach got in the way and I couldn't bend over. I ended up putting flip flops on.

'It was snowing outside and when my dad saw me in my flip flops, he helped me put on shoes.'

Emma has now cut out alcohol altogether and says she can have just as much fun drinking soft drinks 

Mortified, Emma made a New Year's resolution to lose weight. Days later she joined the gym and began exercising at least five times a week, focusing on cardio, as well as completing circuit training.

Emma used the phone app, 'My Fitness Pal' to calculate a healthy calorie intake, based on her weight, height, sex and age, and she slashed her daily calorie intake from 5,000 to 1,200.

Cutting out junk food, and eating balanced, nutritious meals, within three months she had lost two stone.

Emma stopped attending the gym after the first three months, and used her diet to continue losing weight.

But in the summer of 2013 she returned to the gym and began weight training to tone her arms and stomach.

Emma and her boyfriend Leon now allow themselves one cheat day a week where they can eat what they want and the rest of the week they eat healthily

Emma met her now boyfriend Leon  in August 2013 and he introduced her to weight training.

Emma says: 'We met on a night out and started going to the gym together. And when I started weight training, that's when I got addicted to the gym.

'Leon was amazed when I showed him pictures of what I used to look like. He had no idea.

'Being with someone who has the same healthy outlook has been inspirational. We have a home gym and I've stopped drinking alcohol.'

'But I can have just as much fun on a night out on soft drinks. If my younger self could see me now, and how having a healthy lifestyle has become an obsession, she would absolutely punch me in the face. I used to hate people like me.'

Emma, who completed her transformation by having a breast enlargement operation in February 2014, is proud of her 6st 2lb weight loss, as well as her new outlook.

She says: 'I make the right choices now. Leon and I eat healthily, but once a week we have a 'cheat' meal, where we're allowed to indulge ourselves.

'Now when I'm slobbing out on the sofa with a pizza, I'm not sat there alone.'
