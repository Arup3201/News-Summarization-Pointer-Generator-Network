Nottinghamshire have bolstered their depleted batting ranks by signing up Zimbabwean Brendan Taylor.

With Michael Lumb and Jake Libby injured, Taylor will come in to patch up the squad. Terms of his stay at Nottinghamshire will be agreed once Zimbabwe complete their World Cup campaign with a pool match against India on Saturday.

The club's director of cricket Mick Newell said in a statement: 'Ahead of the upcoming season, we have found ourselves with two batsmen injured and face the potential loss of players to international commitments.

'We have decided to strengthen our batting order with Brendan, a proven player who will be an excellent addition to the side.'

Although Zimbabwe cannot reach the knock-out stage, Taylor, 29, has been a strong performer for his country at the World Cup.

After innings of 40, 47, 37 and 50 in Zimbabwe's opening four matches, he scored a rapid 121 in the defeat to Ireland.

The signing is subject to England and Wales Cricket Board approval, Nottinghamshire said.
