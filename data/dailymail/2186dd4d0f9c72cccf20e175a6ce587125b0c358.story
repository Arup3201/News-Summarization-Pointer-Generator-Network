A lucky soldier has been named the ‘bullet magnet’ after being shot twice by the Taliban in the space of two weeks - and surviving both attacks uninjured.

Daniel Leonard, 21, had his rifle butt broken by enemy fire before another bullet went into body armour protecting his back just days later.

The young soldier, from Sunderland, didn’t even realise he had been shot the second time – and thought he had merely been given a prod by his commanding officer to 'get down'.

The jolt from behind was in fact a high-velocity bullet which could have killed him.

It was only when he got back to base he discovered that he had been hit and his Osprey body armour had been shattered.

The young serviceman, from C Company, 3rd Battalion, The Rifles, has only been in Afghanistan since April.

His best friend Sheldon Steel, 21, was killed in a Taliban bomb blast last November.

Daniel, 21, told the Daily Star Sunday: ‘I've been unlucky to be hit twice but very lucky to have survived.

‘I have only been here two months and I've already been hit in the butt and the back by the Taliban!’

He said when he was struck in the back for a second time he was stunned – because he could easily have been killed.

He added: ‘When I saw the size of the bullet that hit me and how it had smashed the plate, I realised I had been lucky. If it wasn't for my armour I'd have been a goner.’

The soldier was covering Army engineers as they built a bridge in Nad-e Ali North, near Kandahar in the south of the country, when he came under fire as he took cover in the corner of a compound.

Two weeks beforehand the butt of his rifle was blasted off as he ran for cover after coming under fire.

He is currently on a six-month tour of duty in the country.

Daniel said that his mother, father and model girlfriend Emma Crowther, 17, had been stunned to learn that he had been shot twice.

His army comrades have taken to calling him 'the bullet magnet' after the incidents.
