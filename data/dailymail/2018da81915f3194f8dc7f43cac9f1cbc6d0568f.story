Oprah Winfrey's annual earnings fell by a massive $125 million last year, but she is still the world's highest paid celebrity.

The TV mogul earned a cool $165 million down from $290 million from a year earlier, according to Forbes magazine.

It means she tops the the magazine's list of high earning stars for a fourth consecutive time, but the gap at the top is closing fast.

Oprah's chatshow closed it's doors in 2011 after a 25 year run but her ownership of syndicated TV shows such as 'Dr. Phil,' 'Rachael Ray, 'The Dr. Oz Show' has kept her at the top of the league.

But snapping at her heels is Transformers director Michael Bay, just $5million behind with earnings of $160 million.

The filmmaker coined it in thanks to the success of the second sequel Transformers: Dark of the Moon and a deal which means he earns a slice of the profits from toy sales.

And next year, Forbes won't be including any of Winfrey's earnings from syndication, meaning she is looking more likely to loose the top spot.

Steven Spielberg was third with earnings of $130 million partly bolstered by proceeds from his catalogue of classic films.

He also benefits from a cut of ticket sales at Universal Studios amusement park, DreamWorks earnings and his director's salary.

Jerry Bruckheimer, known for action blockbusters like last year's Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides which brought in $1 billion worldwide is in fourth place with $115 million.

And breaking into the top five is gangster rapper turned headphone mogul Dr Dre who earned a $110 million.

The former NWA star was paid $300 million by electronics giant HTC for a stake in his Beats by Dr Dre company which he founded in 2006.
