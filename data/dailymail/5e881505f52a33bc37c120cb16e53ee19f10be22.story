This is the moment a pensioner who got stuck in the mud while out walking her dog was rescued by emergency services.

The stricken lady, thought to be in her 70s, was walking near her home on Dartmoor, Devon when she became stuck.

She dialled 999 but struggled to get through due to poor phone reception and after several calls was heard to say 'itâ€™s now up to my' before the line went dead.

Ordeal: A walker in her 70s got stuck in the mud while out walking on Dartmoor, Devon. She called emergency services but due to poor reception was cut off as she said 'it's not up to my..'

Devon and Cornwall Police deployed a helicopter and at 2.42pm on Saturday the crew spotted the woman.

With assistance from a family of farmers, a ladder and an old door, officers managed to reach the woman and slowly extract her from the mud.

By 3pm the woman was safely back on 
solid ground and the farmers helped further by allowing her to shower 
and dry off at their home, and even provided her with fresh clothes.

The woman suffered no serious injuries, just bruising as a result of her ordeal.

PC Adrian Taylor, an air observer for the National Police Air Service, said: 'When we were called to assist we knew we needed to find her quickly as she was very distressed, cold and uncomfortable.

'Without the assistance of the helicopter, officers could have searched for hours without locating her.

'The woman was completely stuck, up to her waist in thick mud, and unable to move.

'She was in the course of a small river and had simply sunk into an unexpectedly deep section of mud.

Team: Police officers who assisted in rescuing the woman - who escaped with minor injuries

'The depth and consistency of the mud was very unpredictable and clearly hazardous in places.'

PC Taylor added: 'As an experienced walker, she was well equipped for most occasions but was very unlucky to get trapped as she did.

'The incident does serve as a reminder that even experienced, competent walkers can get into difficulties very suddenly on Dartmoor.

'Fortunately she had a mobile phone with her and it was in an accessible place so she was able to reach it and call for help.

'The rescue was a fantastic team effort with assistance from the police helicopter, officers on the ground and the local farmers.

'The officers who got her out were all very muddy by the end but we are thankful it was a happy ending.'

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said: 'After a lot of rapid enquiries, including requests to mobile phone providers, it was established at about 2.15pm that the woman was not far from Brent Tor, north of Tavistock.

'The police helicopter was deployed as well as officers from Tavistock and Okehampton, and at 2.42pm the helicopter crew spotted the woman and directed officers to her.

'With assistance from a family of farmers, a ladder and an old door, officers managed to reach the woman and slowly extract her from the mud.'
