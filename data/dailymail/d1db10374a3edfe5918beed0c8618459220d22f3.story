A week shy of his 21st birthday and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has emerged with his spirits unscathed after a season when injuries conspired to rule him out of the World Cup and Arsenal’s first trophy win in nine years.

‘Things I’ve learned?’ the Ox wondered aloud, as he reflected on the past 12 months. ‘Don’t get injured. It’s not nice.’

More opportunities are sure to follow, starting with Sunday’s FA Community Shield against Manchester City, which heralds a fresh start for the England midfielder.

‘I’ve learned to cope with disappointing times,’ he added. ‘It’s the first time I’ve had a situation like that. It’s horrible to see everyone playing and getting the rewards from winning games when you can’t do that. But if you look at it with a positive attitude, you do come out of the other side really well.

‘You work on things you don’t know about until you’re injured. Everyone goes to the gym for the bicep bells and bench-press, but when you’re injured you work on your core, your pelvic floor, groins, glutes, stuff like yoga that makes you stronger all-round in terms of injury prevention. I’ve learned to look after my body more than I used to.’

Oxlade-Chamberlain damaged cruciate knee ligaments on the opening day of last season but returned in good form in January, only to be troubled by a groin problem at the end of the campaign.

He missed the FA Cup final but was ruled fit for the World Cup, only to suffer a minor knee injury in a warm-up friendly against Ecuador in Miami.

Roy Hodgson kept him in the squad but a setback ahead of England’s final game, against Costa Rica, dashed all hope of featuring in the tournament.

‘It was a great experience to be at a World Cup,’ he said. ‘I took a lot from being around the camp. I definitely wouldn’t have wanted to be sat at home. I was handing out water bottles and trying to get the boys through the games when they were cramping. That’s the feeling you get in a team.’

His mood is echoed at the Emirates Stadium, where Arsenal are relishing the chance to prove the FA Cup triumph will spark a new era of success.

‘We all believed it would happen soon,’ said Oxlade-Chamberlain. ‘It was a reward for the hard work and togetherness we’ve had to show. It does start a winning momentum. 

'Once you know you can win a competition like that, it gives you confidence. It’s really exciting to see someone like Alexis Sanchez come in and our World Cup winners will come back and give us another lift. These are exciting times.

‘It makes you want to strive for more. I’ve set myself the same goals we all would, which is to win the Premier League, the FA Cup and try to do really well and win the Champions League.’
