Eleven members of the same family who kidnapped and tortured a couple they falsely suspected of murdering a widow have been jailed in what police described as the worst case of vigilantism they have seen.

The victims, who have been given new identities and cannot be named for legal reasons, were held against their will and subjected to severe beatings by the group as they attempted to extract confessions for the alleged killing.

Judge Stephen Holt told Norwich Crown Court the group had kidnapped and interrogated their victims in 'scenes reminiscent of a Hollywood film'.

Police seized camcorder footage of 
one of the beatings - which the attackers had hoped to use to force 
officers to prosecute the couple for murder.

The
 attacks happened after 75-year-old Gertrude Frankham - widow of leading
 travellers’ rights campaigner Eli Frankham - was found dead in her bed 
in Walpole St Andrew, Norfolk, in December 2012.

Speaking
 after the group was sentenced, Superintendent Dennis Lacey said: 
'Despite there never being any evidence of murder they decided to take 
the law into their own hands through violence and intimidation.

'In
 27 years in the police, I have never seen anything like this in terms 
of the number of people involved and the seriousness of the assaults.

Six members of Mrs Frankham’s family - including daughters Sheila Conboy (left) and Valerie Harris (right) were found guilty of various offences 

'Vigilantism cannot be tolerated and the sentences handed down reflect the unnecessary level of violence used.'

Six
 members of Mrs Frankham’s family - including daughters Violet Chilton, 
Sheila Conboy and Valerie Harris along with some of her grandchildren 
and great grandchildren - were found guilty of various offences after a 
trial earlier this year. 

Five others admitted their involvement.

Despite
 police exhuming Mrs Frankham’s body and two post-mortem examinations 
finding she died of natural causes, the family continued to believe the 
pair had killed and stolen from her.

Speaking
 to local newspaper the Lynn News after her mother’s death, Violet 
Chilton said: 'I will fight until the day I die for justice. She was our
 queen and she deserves justice.'

Prosecutor John Farmer told 
the court that the offenders took on different roles with some acting as
 interrogators and others as violent enforcers in an attempt to gather 
evidence to give to the police.

The pair were individually dragged to
 a warehouse and made to sit in a chair as they were surrounded and 
beaten in April last year, Mr Farmer said.

During the attack on the woman, who was seven months pregnant, Conboy called police to say she had confessed to murder.

Edward Dolan admitted kidnap, two counts of false imprisonment and wounding with intent

The
 recording of the 999 call, which was played in court, includes the 
woman screaming as she was repeatedly hit in a 'brutal' attack.

The male victim was told that if he went to police his family would be killed while he was forced to watch, the trial heard.

Both
 suffered severe injuries and the woman went into labour and 
successfully gave birth soon after being released from hospital. 

Passing sentence, Judge Holt said some of the family still believe Mrs Frankham was murdered.

He added: 'This is a family that believed it was above the law and imposed its own law.

'We can hear on the video pure aggression in your voices.

'The psychological impact of this is impossible to comprehend.'

Violet Chilton, 57, of St John’s Fen End, was found guilty of false imprisonment and grievous bodily harm after a trial earlier this year. She was ordered to serve six years in prison.

Thomas Chilton, 29, of St John’s Fen End, was found guilty of two counts of kidnap and two of false imprisonment. He was imprisoned for six years. 

Edward Dolan Jnr, 18, of Walpole, was found guilty of kidnap and false imprisonment. He will serve 18 months in youth custody.

Carrying a placard reading 'We will get your justice granny', her grandson Alfie Frankham, 42, said: 'The wrong people have gone to jail today.'

The family issued a statement reading: 'Family members have been sentenced here today for taking the law into their own hands as they felt the police never took their concerns seriously enough.

'Today is the beginning of our campaign: Justice for Gert Frankham.'
