A young British designer is locked in a legal battle with Marks & Spencer after the store began selling framed wall prints that she says are almost identical to her work.

Louise Verity, 31, has been creating framed pictures of large printed messages on top of old pages from a dictionary since 2009, selling them through her independent art business Bookishly.

But the artist became alarmed when she learned that M&S had begun selling almost identical prints - using a similar font and with the slogans in the same position as her work - through its stores and website.

She said: ‘At first, people were really pleased for me because they thought I’d been commissioned by M&S, but obviously I hadn’t.’ Taking inspiration from her love of words and books Mrs Verity says she collects quotes form classic literature, films, songs and ‘other wise old sources to print onto vintage book pages’.

Describing her products as ‘literary gifts’, she said: ‘You’ll also find some vintage map prints, book page jewellery and greetings cards in the mix.’ The designer added: ‘It all started with an antique French dictionary and my grandfather’s set of water colours.

‘I still spend a lot of time hunting through old bookshops looking for inspiration and for books to give a new lease of life as a little piece of art.’ The prints are then mounted in frames supplied by her parent’s company, making the product very much family-inspired.

Concerned that the High Street retailer had stolen her idea the designer, a married mother-of-one from Kettering, Northamptonshire, instructed solicitors who advised her M&S had breached her copyright.

Success: Mrs Verity sold over 2,000 wall prints in the eight weeks leading up to Christmas 2013, priced at £24.75 each

Last night Mrs Verity told the Daily Mail: ‘I just wish Marks and Spencer had have commissioned me to do the work - that would have been amazing.

‘There are loads of brilliant small designers who could be doing that for them.’

A legal letter sent to M&S said: ‘The image posted on your Instagram site shows a substantially similar product. It is our contention that this is a substantially similar product. It is our contention that this is a substantial taking of our client’s work and hence an infringement of her copyright.

‘We therefore request that you immediately remove this image from your Instagram site, and any other location in which it may be available. We further request that you supply us with information regarding the producer of this infringing product.’ However the retail giant dismissed her concerns claiming her designs used a ‘common technique’.

And in a fiercely worded legal letter, drafted by M&S solicitor Amarjit Purewal, branded her claim of breach of copyright as ‘unfounded’.

Response: The retail giant dismissed Mrs Verity's concerns claiming her designs used a 'common technique'

It said: ‘Whilst there may or may not be copyright subsisting in any particular work your client has produced, we do not believe that your client can claim a monopoly in the actual use of ‘over-laying’ printed words on dictionary pages.

‘It is our understanding that overlaying of typed words or other imagery on a background of a densely worded page from a dictionary, is not an uncommon design feature.

‘Accordingly, your client’s allegations of copyright infringement are unmeritorious and unfounded.’ Mrs Verity said she was not surprised by M&S’s response and acknowledged it would be a David versus Goliath fight if the case ever went to court.

She said: ‘They must know it will cost me tens of thousands of pounds in legal fees to take this further with no guarantee that I’ll get the money back if I win.

‘My concern is that my business will suffer, including my mother, father and brother’s business, which I buy the frames from.’ 

Mrs Verity sold over 2,000 wall prints in the eight weeks leading up to Christmas 2013, priced at £24.75 each.

M&S began selling their own wall prints in November last year, priced at £25.00 each.

Last night M&S said it was no longer selling the framed wall prints, claiming the product had only been released as a ‘small buy’. The firm added it was trying to reach agreement with Mrs Verity.

A spokeswoman said: ‘We take all claims of intellectual property infringement extremely seriously.

‘We’ve investigated this thoroughly and determined that the technique of overlaying text on print is a common design practice.

‘We’ve already been in touch with Bookishly directly and we’re happy to follow up with them if they have any questions.
