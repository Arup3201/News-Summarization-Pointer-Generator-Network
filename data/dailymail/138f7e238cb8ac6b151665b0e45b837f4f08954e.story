Two 19-year-old students at the University of Washington in Seattle have launched a phone app to deliver cannabis to medical-marijuana users.

Josiah Tullis and Megh Vakharia describe their business as ‘Uber for marijuana.’

The app, called Canary, allows medical-marijuana cardholders to select different strains of pot from different medical dispensaries and then have it delivered by a cardholding driver.

Users can buy in quantities ranging from a gram to an ounce.

The app also describes the sensations users can expect to experience with each strain. For example, it describes a variety called White Widow as ‘Happy. Euphoric. Uplifted.’

‘Canary is an on-demand service that allows you to get cannabis delivered right to your doorstep,’ Vakharia told AJC.com.

To avoid any legal issues, the service will work only with medical dispensaries providing to cardholding patients.

‘We check. We do some double verification that is required of medical-marijuana patients. They have to take a picture of the card and also present it upon arrival,’ said Vakharia.

However the students are confident there will be potential to expand as recreational marijuana stores will open in Washington next month.

The students have already started interviewing drivers from Uber and Lyft to work for Canary instead. All drivers have to undergo background checks.

Canary also has a feature called Munchies, where users can have the drivers bring along ‘popular food and drink items.’

‘Yeah, we thought of everything,’ states the website.

According to the students, their app has already begun to attract investors, and they have plans to expand to Denver and eventually California

The two friends pitched the idea at a startup conference last week sponsored by TechCrunch.

'We had to have a 60-second pitch, and we were pitching around 800 or so people. And we ended up winning audience choice!' Tullis said.

'We said, "We're delivering green to make green" at the end of the pitch and they all seemed to like that.'

The app has already begun to attract investors, and the students have plans to expand to Denver and eventually California. The app launches in Seattle late next month.
