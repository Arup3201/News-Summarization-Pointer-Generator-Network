Punishment: Christopher Howson, 50, a computer programmer from suburban New York, has been sentenced to 22 years in prison for strangling to death his wife in January 2013

A computer programmer and father of two from suburban New York has been sentenced to 22 years in prison for strangling his wife to death as their daughters slept upstairs. 

Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore announced the sentence Tuesday for 50-year-old Christopher Howson.

He pleaded guilty to manslaughter in May for killing Theresa Gorski, 47, in their Sleepy Hollow home.

On January 5, 2013, Mr Howson called 911 and said he had just strangled his wife.

Mrs Gorski a part-time staff attorney for the Bronx Legal Aid Society, remained on a ventilator at a local hospital for four days before she passed away.

Authorities have said the couple's two daughters, ages 5 and 8 at the time, were home when their mother's killing took place.

In court Tuesday, Christopher Howson's mother, Mary Howson, decried her son's sentence as overly harsh, The Journal News reported.

'Chris is a very kind and gentle person,' she said. 'This was really a Greek tragedy.'

The defendant also got a chance to say a few words in court before learning his fate.

'I could have never conceived I could do such a thing,' he tearfully said.

According to local reports, Christopher Howson and Theresa Gorski had martial problems and were receiving counseling when in the early hours of January 5, 2013, the computer programmer attacked his wife during one of their frequent fights.

At around 3am, he called police to report that he had killed Theresa.

Officers who responded to the family’s' two-story house in the 120 block of New Broadway in Sleepy Hollow found Mrs Gorski in cardiac arrest.

The dying woman was rushed to Phelps Memorial Hospital Center, where she was pronounced dead from her injuries on January 9.

When questioned by police, Mr Howson said that he and his wife had been fighting and he strangled her because he could not take it anymore.

In court Tuesday, Judge Richard Molea called the killing a selfish act.

'You had other ways to handle your situation,' the judge told the defendant.

Theresa Gorski had spent 12 years working for the Legal aid Society representing abused children. 

Theresa’s sister, Jo Ann Gorski, a clinical psychologist by trade, has been caring for the Howsons’  two daughters since her brother-in-law's arrest last year.
