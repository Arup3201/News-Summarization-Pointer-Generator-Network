His persistent requests to meet Pope Francis were apparently snubbed at the last minute.

But there appeared to be no ill feelings on Russell Crowe's part when he was seen in jovial spirits among the crowd queuing to see the pontiff today.

The
Noah star was supposed to have a reserved place in the VIP section
 of the Pope's general audience so the leader of the Catholic church could give his approval to the £70million film.

But according to film company Paramount the Vatican cancelled, saying Crowe’s appearance would be too disruptive.

Nonetheless, the actor was already in 
Rome for the film’s Italian premiere and decided to attend the pontiff's weekly
 address in any case.

Crowe took the unusual step of 
petitioning the Pope on Twitter, sending him at least 
five pleading messages, asking if he would watch the film.

A
 meeting was tentatively scheduled with Paramount vice chairman Rob Moore, 
director Darren Aronofsky and Crowe during today's general 
audience, Variety magazine claimed. 

However, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a meeting between the Pope and the Noah team was ‘never on the cards’.

Noah is thought to cost in the region of £75million and is due for release in America on March 29

Aronofsky's film, based around the story of Noah’s Ark from The Book Of
 Genesis, has already gained a fair amount of criticism.

Agnostic US TV host Bill Maher slammed the movie for a perceived lack of ‘plausibility.’

'But the thing that’s really disturbing about Noah isn’t the silly, it’s that it’s immoral,’ he said. 'It’s about a psychotic mass murderer who gets away with it, and his name is God.'

Noah is also thought to be banned in several countries for depicting religious characters, with censorship boards in Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates informing distributor Paramount that they won’t be releasing the film.

Speaking of his latest role, the actor recently claimed his depiction of Noah will go against the grain of common belief regarding his character.

He said: ‘The funny thing with people, they consider Noah to be a benevolent figure because he looked after the animals: "Awww, Noah. Noah and the animals."

'It's like, are you kidding me.This is the dude that stood by and watched the entire population of the planet perish.

‘He's not benevolent. He's not even nice.

'At one point in the story his son says, "I thought you were chosen because you were good?" And he goes, "I was chosen because I can get the job done, mate".'
