For the second time during the primaries, Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum has made a blunder about Puerto Rico.

On the day Puerto Ricans head to the polls to cast their votes for the nation's next president, Mr Santorum referred to the archipelago as a ‘Spanish-speaking country.’

In fact, Puerto Rico is not a country at all, but an unincorporated territory of the United States.

Last week, the former Pennsylvania senator told a Puerto Rican newspaper that the territory’s admittance as the America’s 51st state was contingent on its residents speaking English as its official language.

Claim to fame: Rick Santorum (left) claims he'll win the GOP nomination if he can beat Romney (right) in Illinois this Tuesday - despite estimates that he trails Romney by some 240 delegates

Puerto Rico's residents cannot vote in general elections, but are set to award 20 delegates in their Sunday Republican primary.

Turnout appeared light around the 
island, and officials predicted about 150,000 people would cast ballots 
in the Republican primary.

Among them was Francisco Rodriguez, a
76-year-old pro-statehood architect who was supporting Mr Romney, in 
part because the former Massachusetts governor had secured the 
endorsement of Gov. Luis Fortuno and other leading politicians.

'He has a stronger connection to 
Puerto Rico and that will help us in the process of becoming a state,’ 
Mr Fortuno told the Associated Press.

He had kind words for Mr Santorum, 
describing him as a 'person of faith, a good Catholic,' but thinks the 
former senator hurt himself with his statements that English should be 
the official language.

'In Puerto Rico, we get along fine with both languages,' he said.

On Saturday, Mr Santorum boldly claimed he’ll garner the Republican nomination if he wins Tuesday’s primary in Illinois. 

Speaking
yesterday in the state, he said: ‘If we’re able to come out of Illinois
with a huge or surprise win, I guarantee you, I guarantee you that we 
will win this nomination.’

However,
rival Mitt Romney rebutted by asserting that his prospects look the 
sunniest, saying: ‘I bet I’m going to become the nominee.’

Mr Romney’s claim seemed much more suited, as he currently leads Mr Santorum by an estimated 243 delegates; Illinois will only award 69.

'If we're able to come out of Illinois 
with a huge or surprise win, I guarantee you that we 
will win this nomination.'

However, recent polls show the former senator is favoured by conservatives in the state’s southern areas.

The former Massachusetts governor told Fox News Sunday: ‘I can’t tell you exactly how the process is going to work,’ referring to the rest of the Republican primaries, which run through June 26.

He continued: ‘I sure hope I’m going to become the nominee, and if I am, I’m going to be a strong nominee.’

He faces brighter prospects in Tuesday’s primary, as Illinois is generally seen as friendly territory. In addition, Mr Romney has a big edge in delegates, campaign cash and organizational resources.

Odds aside, Mr Santorum appears resolute. He told CNN's State of the Union that 'we're in this to win' and that there's too little difference between Mr Romney and President Obama to satisfy conservative Republicans.

Mr Santorum says conservatives want a chance to nominate a conservative to take on the Democratic incumbent and 'we're going to give them an opportunity.'

The former Pennsylvania senator hasn't qualified for the ballot in all the states on the election calendar and sometimes has had trouble fielding full slates of delegates in some states.

But he says he's doing pretty well with scarce resources, compared with the deep-pocketed Romney campaign.

The Midwestern state's Republicans are relatively moderate and on paper should give Romney a boost after he lost to Santorum in Alabama and Mississippi this week.

Illinois is Democratic President Barack Obama's home state and is expected to vote for Obama in the November 6 presidential election over the Republican challenger.

But many Republicans believe he needs more than just delegate math and must produce some big wins in the state-by-state campaign to prove he is a worthy front-runner.

'If Romney wins Illinois, people will say he is sealing the deal as a front-runner candidate,' Republican strategist Ron Bonjean told Reuters.

'If he loses, then they're saying he still has a lot of work to do and he's relying on delegate math and that he may win by the numbers but he also has to win by momentum to generate enthusiasm.'

Forces loyal to Romney are pouring money into Illinois. Romney and his backers are believed to be spending more than $4 million there, while Santorum's outside group announced a $310,000 effort.

Word on the street was that Romney came under pressure to win Illinois from some of his financial backers during a day of fundraising in New York on Wednesday.

'The money guys made it clear that you've got to win Illinois,' said a veteran Republican strategist, who asked to remain unidentified.

Mr Romney campaign sources cast doubt on the comment and said they were not aware of any such demand. 'I don't think anything big happened or I would've heard about it,' said one.

Mr Romney has already had big victories this year when his back was against the wall.

He won Florida decisively after losing South Carolina to Gingrich, and turned back Santorum in Michigan and Ohio.
