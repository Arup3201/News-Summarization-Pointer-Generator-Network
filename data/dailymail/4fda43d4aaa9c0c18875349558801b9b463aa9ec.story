So will the latest method of getting your figure back after giving birth really work? Of corset will.

Experts say wearing a corset or girdle after giving birth may genuinely help a woman get back into shape.

In April, actress Jessica Alba revealed that she wore corsets after the births of daughters Honor, four, and Haven, one. Gwyneth Paltrow sported one by Agent Provocateur after the birth of her son Moses, now seven.

Pulled over the post-pregnancy tummy, the garments are fastened with Velcro, hooks and eyes or held up by their thick  elastic material.

‘There are two key reasons why they may be of benefit,’ says Clive Spence-Jones,  consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician at The London Clinic.

‘I am frequently asked about these garments, and I’ve never said no to a patient.

‘During pregnancy the rectus abdominus – the muscle running down the centre of the abdomen – separates, and leaves a crescent-shaped hole. Over time, these muscles need to come back together again.

‘I think these corsets help push them together a bit more quickly.

‘There is a great deal of anecdotal evidence about this, but no clinical evidence as yet. However, the more quickly your stomach muscles go back together, the faster you will regain your figure.’

Mr Spence-Jones added: ‘Check with a medical professional. It is likely to be very uncomfortable post-caesarean.’

Women’s health specialist Jennifer White said: ‘They may also give support to the  back, help with posture and encourage the muscles to work properly.

‘Improving posture and pulling in stomach muscles will make you look thinner, but in terms of losing fat long-term – that’s still down to exercise and diet.’

Companies who sell corsets and girdles say sales have been increasing for years.

‘Celebrity interest has certainly raised our profile,’ says Anna Blakey, from medical  supplies company MaCom. ‘But it’s not a gimmick – they make sense.’
