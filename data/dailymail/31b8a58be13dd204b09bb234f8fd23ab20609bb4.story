Charged: Robert Dellinger, pictured, 
slammed his pickup truck into an SUV on a North Hampshire highway, killing two people

A former Fortune 500 executive who plowed his car into an SUV killing a pregnant woman and her fiance in a botched suicide attempt last week could be charged with murder.

Robert Dellinger, 53, told police he was depressed and aiming to kill himself when he drove his full-size pick-up truck across a grassy median on Interstate 89 in North Hampshire, went airborne and crushed to death a young Vermont couple expecting their first child in January.

Dellinger, from Sunapee, survived the suicide attempt with cuts on his head and face.

He was charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter, a crime that carries 15-30 years in prison if convicted.

But what was going through Dellinger's mind and whether he showed 'extreme indifference' to human life could get him a more serious charge of second-degree murder that carries up to life in prison.

Jason Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, suffered injuries a medical examiner said were consistent with a plane crash. The unborn child did not survive.

Veteran defense attorney and University of New Hampshire law school professor Albert Scherr said he has no doubt prosecutors are considering elevating the charges to murder, but hastened to add there's little precedent for a case like Dellinger's.

'It's such strange and outrageous behavior. There's a vacuum in terms of the details of what was in his mind,' Scherr said.

'If he's focused on committing suicide, is he thinking about other people's lives? Or does it fall closer to driving really fast and hoping you go so fast you go off the road and kill yourself and you're not thinking about anyone else?'

Senior Assistant Attorney General Susan Morrell said last week they are considering additional charges against Dellinger, who left as a senior vice president and chief financial officer of PPG Industries in 2011 because of health issues.

He had also worked for Sprint, Delphi and General Electric.

Asked why Dellinger wasn't charged with second-degree murder at the outset, Morrell said, 'We're still collecting evidence. We examine the evidence and pursue the appropriate charges.'

Dellinger has not been charged in connection with the loss of the fetus.

Former Governor John Lynch in 2012 vetoed legislation that would have expanded the state's homicide laws to include the death of a fetus eight weeks or older.

Dellinger's lawyer, Peter DeCato, did not return calls seeking comment.

Dellinger, who lives in Sunapee but maintains a home in Kansas, is free on $250,000 cash bond and must wear an electronic monitoring device and undergo a psychiatric evaluation.

Prosecutors said in court on 
Wednesday that Dellinger's truck crossed the median on Interstate 89 
early afternoon on December 7, became airborne and sheared off the top 
of the couple's car, killing them instantly.

According
 to prosecutors, Dellinger told troopers after the crash that he had 
argued with his wife over medication he was taking for depression and 
was driving around when he decided to commit suicide.

'He told us that Saturday in the hospital that he intended to cross that median at a high rate of speed,' Morrell said.

Angry: Friends expressed their anger and devastation on Timmons' brother Ray Blanchard's page, claiming Dellinger should have been charged with three counts of manslaughter

Attorney Jonathan Cohen, who is not involved in Dellinger's case, said it's not a stretch to think prosecutors may seek to increase the charges once all the evidence is in.

'I think a prosecutor could make the argument to a jury that intentionally driving your car across the median of a roadway manifests an extreme indifference to human life,' Cohen said.

He'll have to stay in New Hampshire despite a request by his lawyer to allow him to travel for mental health treatment in Kansas, where he has property.

Timmons and Murphy got engaged in March this year, according to Timmons' Facebook account.

They lived in Wilder, Vermont, and met while working at valley Terrace Assisted Living Facility.

Timmons has three children from another relationship, Faith, Aubrey and Gavin Timmons. He enjoyed the outdoors, especially fishing with his fiance, the Valley News reported.

Friends expressed their anger and devastation on Timmons' brother Ray Blanchard's page, claiming Dellinger should have been charged with three counts of manslaughter.

Blanchard's girlfriend wrote on his behalf on December 8: 'As some of you may already know we lost two amazing individuals that we were so blessed to be apart of their lives ..we also lost the chance to meet lil Raegan .. Jasons brother Ray is unable to respond but my kids and I will send him your thoughts if anyone would like to write to him please feel free I will give you his address.... RIP !!! Jason Timmons and Amanda Murphy .... We all love you so much !!'

Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was arraigned by video at Lebanon 
District Court in New Hampshire on Wednesday on two counts of manslaughter

Amanda Murphy was very excited to be a mother for the first time, and the couple had already named their daughter Reagan Elizabeth.

Catherine Amarante, executive director at the care facility, where Murphy was lead caregiver said of the pair, 'He certainly was very, very loving, as was she. She really wanted to have this baby.'

She added to the New Hampshire Union Leader that the facility held a baby shower for Murphy last Wednesday and she was 'glowing.'

'So it's shocking. We're still in shock,' she said. 'We deal with death in elders, and that's hard in and of itself, but this is totally different.'

Amarante said Murphy was trustworthy, intuitive, and worked well with dementia patients. Timmons was 'a gentle giant.'

'Just a big tall guy and a really, really good caregiver and really loved by the patients and staff,' she said.
