Meet Ben Byrne - the man sharing the bed of Perth identical twins Anna and Lucy DeCinque who spent more than $240,000 on surgeries to look more alike.

The 31-year-old won the hearts of both girls after they added him on Facebook on the suggestion of mutual friends.

At first, the electrical mechanic had trouble balancing the demands of two girlfriends, but very early on into their 18-month relationship he learned the attention he paid to one, had to be paid to the other.

Anna and Lucy DeCinque, from Perth, share everything - even their boyfriend Ben Byrne

The twins' boyfriend is a 31-year-old electrical mechanic and says at first he found it hard to balance two girlfriends

'It's my first time with two girlfriends, and to be honest it's very difficult because it has to be 100 per cent even,' Mr Byrne told Woman's Day.

'Whatever I do for one I have to do for the other, so it's a fine balance. My mates reckon it's a cool problem to have.'

This is the first time the health nut has spoken out about his unorthodox relationship with the 28-year-olds since he came to the attention of global media when Anna and Lucy's story came to light earlier this year.

But after living with the twins and their mother, Jeanna, for 10 months, he now feels more comfortable to share.Â 

At first, the Perth fitness enthusiast was shy but now that he has lived with the girls for 10 months he's ready to share

Anna and Lucy DeCinque came to the attention of the media when it was revealed they had spent more than $240,000 to look more alike

Lucy said the question they got the most was: 'How does one guy keep up with two girls in the bedroom?'

'Put it this way, we're very active girls and he needs twice the energy,' she said.

But Mr Byrne is probably more open than most men to having identical twins as girlfriends.

Dubbed as 'The Chosen One' by the DeCinque girls, Mr Byrne himself is a twin.

The trio live on the top of floor of a two-storey home with the girls' mother, Jeanna

And more importantly he has the seal of approval from Anna and Lucy's mother who said her girls' live-in boyfriend was 'a true gentleman'.

Jeanna said she was happy as long as the girls were happy and had formed a strong bond with Mr Byrne as she found herself sticking up for him when he fought with the twins.

Intimate details of Anna and Lucy DeCinque's relationship were revealed in Woman's Day

Mr Byrne told Woman's Day that was probably the worst part of his relationship because it was always 'two versus one'.

'But on the bright side I get double the love,' he said.

The girls made world headlines when their story was revealed to media outlets.

They have spent $240,800 on cosmetic procedures to look more alike - including lip fillers, breast implants, and fake eyebrows and eyelashes.

But it's not just a boyfriend and looks, the pair have in common.

Anna and Lucy also share a job, a car and a Facebook account - on which they first met their boyfriend.

Mr Byrne said they talked for about six months before they met in person.

Anna said they put off their first meeting as long as they could because they had 'trust issues', and wanted to make sure Mr Byrne was the real deal.
