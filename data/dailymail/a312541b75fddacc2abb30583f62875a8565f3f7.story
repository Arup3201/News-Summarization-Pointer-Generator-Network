Relatives of Mark Duggan are demanding justice over his death after he was shot by police two years ago

Relatives of Mark Duggan are demanding justice over his death which sparked a national wave of riots and looting after a watchdog said the officers involved did not break the law. 

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had found no evidence of criminality by officers in the shooting of Mr Duggan.

His family joined justice campaigners at a meeting last night along with speakers including supporters of Cynthia Jarrett, whose death after police raided her home sparked the Broadwater Farm riots in Tottenham, north London, in the 1980s. 

The police watchdog has been investigating whether any of the 11 CO19 firearms officers involved in Mr Duggan's shooting committed any wrongdoing, but a spokeswoman said today: 'We have found no evidence to indicate criminality at this stage.'

As she attended the meeting in Tottenham, Mr Duggan's aunt, Carole Duggan, told Sky News: 'They've been incompetent from day one.

'They've had to apologise to us as a family on numerous occasions because they've not investigated thoroughly. They've not been transparent at all.'

Earlier she said she wanted the officers involved to be prosecuted.

'It's been two years and we are now waiting for the inquest to get the answers to the questions we have about how and why Mark was killed,' she said.

'We expect those responsible for Mark's death to be prosecuted and for justice to be served.'

A large crowd gathered at the event where attendees discussed their ongoing battles for the truth about their loved ones' deaths.

Civil rights activist Suresh Grover said campaigners needed to make sure there was not a cover up of what happened on the day Mr Duggan died.

He told Sky News: 'The inquest will start soon. 

'This is the anniversary to remember him and to develop a strategy which makes sure that the police are held accountable and that any investigative process that takes place is done thoroughly and properly and people are given the truth and there is no cover up on this issue.'

Mr Duggan was shot by armed police in Tottenham on August 4, 2011 after marksmen stopped the minicab in which he was travelling.

Officers feared the father-of-four was on his way to carry out a revenge shooting for his cousin's  death. An inquest into the 29-year-old's death is due to start next month following a series of delays.

Local outrage at the police shooting marked the start of a wave of rioting, looting, and arson that spread across parts of the country in 2011.

Also attending the meeting were supporters of Sean Rigg, Joy Gardner and Roger Sylvester, who all died after being restrained by police officers.

Ms Gardner, who was facing deportation, died in 1993 after police officers restrained her and gagged her with tape.

Her mother, Myrna Simpson, said: 'It's important for people to fight for justice and don't stop, because there is no other way to get justice but to fight for it. 

'I am still fighting for justice for Joy and not only for Joy but for all. I am fighting for justice for everyone that has been unjustly killed.'
