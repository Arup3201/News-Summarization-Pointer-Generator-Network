A pair of amateur hot air balloonists died when their craft burst into flames as they attempted a high altitude four-mile ascent.

Pilot Lee Pibworth, 42, and his passenger Allan Burnett, 55, were killed after their £20,000 balloon plunged towards earth at more than 60mph before crashing into a field at Midsomer Norton in Somerset.

An inquest at Flax Bourton was today told that the balloon caught fire before two oxygen cylinders on board exploded after it hit the ground at Prattens Bowls Club on New Year’s Day 2011.

Both men sustained horrific injuries in the accident with tree surgeon Mr Pibworth, a father-of-one, dying instantly from chest injuries.

The inquest heard that father-of-three Mr Burnett survived the impact but suffered extensive fractures and was unable to escape the blaze alive.

The pair from Bristol had decided to undertake the challenge in September 2010 in order for Mr Pibworth to gain the 19,700ft ascent standard necessary to earn a British Balloon and Airship Club gold medal.

After spending months meticulously planning the flight they took off from a field in Chelworth just after 9am in front of proud family and friends.

A crew with radios - including Mr Burnett’s son Alex - followed the men on the ground in a trailer but lost contact as they ascended into the clouds.

Alex Burnett, a trainee pilot at the time of the crash, told the inquest he received two calls from his dad during their flight.

In the first, BT engineer Mr Burnett said they had reached 4,600 metres but were turning back after using 60 litres of gas.

He called a final time to state that they had reached 6,600 metres - higher than required - and were heading to the ground.

Alex told the inquest: 'I replied ‘roger that, see you at ground level’. We waited for them to land and tried to estimate their landing place.

'We drove past the accident site thinking it was a car crash after New Year’s Eve.

He said a call was received from a friend saying there had been a balloon accident at Midsomer Norton and aware that no one else was flying in the area Alex drove back to the site.

Giving evidence witnesses said the balloon resembled an 'upside down umbrella' as it sped to the ground.

Tessa Hawtin, who lives just 150 yards from where the balloon landed said: 'There was a horrific noise, we were aware of it for two to three minutes before we actually saw the balloon.

'This balloon appeared out of the sky and instantly I knew it was wrong, it should not look like that. I just stood and watched. I felt so helpless.

'I was aware of somebody on the balloon, he was operating the burners.

'We watched the balloon for several minutes, it felt like a lifetime but it was probably two to three minutes.

'It went quiet and we realised the balloon had come to land.'

She told the inquest she first heard a 'ripping' noise at around 9.30am on the morning of the accident.

Alex said his dad, an experienced mountaineer, was simply a passenger on theflight while experienced Mr Pibworth was pilot.

He said both men were well prepared for their challenged and had planned for the -30 degrees Celsius temperatures and low oxygen at such a high altitude.

Wing Commander Graham Maidrent, a pathologist, told the inquest both men could not have survived the incident.

Mr Burnett suffered fractures to his legs, ribs and bleeding to his brain - but was alive when the blaze began.

The pathologist said: 'The presence of soot in the trachea indicates that he was breathing during exposure to the fire.'

He said Mr Burnett died from 'the effects of fire' and 'multiple injuries'.

Mr Pibworth suffered fractures to his right arm, thigh, lumber spine, pelvis, sternum, a ruptured heart and lacerations to his liver.

His death was caused by 'chest injuries'. Both men were identified by dental records.

The inquest continues.
