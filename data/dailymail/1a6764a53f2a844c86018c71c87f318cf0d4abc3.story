Ian Poulter was embroiled in a bitter social media row with the president of the PGA of America on Friday after being branded ‘a little girl’ for his criticisms of Sir Nick Faldo and Tom Watson.

PGA chief Ted Bishop aimed a puerile assault at the Englishman after Poulter, in his recent book No Limits, lashed out at Faldo’s captaincy of the defeated European team at the 2008 Ryder Cup.

Writing on his Twitter account, Bishop wrote: ‘Faldo’s record stands by itself. Six majors and all-time RC points. Yours vs. His? Lil Girl.’

Poulter said the comments made by Bishop were 'disappointing for the leader of the PGA of America'

In a separate post on his Facebook page, Bishop cited Poulter’s criticisms of Watson’s decisions as US captain in this year’s Ryder Cup, writing: ‘Used to be athletes who had lesser records or accomplishments in a sport never criticised the icons.

‘Tom Watson (8 majors and a 10-3-1 Ryder Cup record) and Nick Faldo (6 majors and all-time Ryder Cup points leader) get bashed by Ian James Poulter. Really? Sounds like a little school girl squealing during recess. C’MON MAN!’

Bishop later deleted the messages, with Poulter hitting back in a statement: ‘Is being called a “lil girl” meant to be derogatory or a put down?

Poulter said Sir Nick Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of his comments about Sergio Garcia

The Englishman also hit out at Tom Watson for dropping Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley at the Ryder Cup 

‘That’s pretty shocking and disappointing, especially coming from the leader of the PGA of America. No further comment.’

The PGA of America said Bishop, whose two-year term in the post ends next month, ‘realised that his post was inappropriate and promptly removed it’. The 60-year-old later said: ‘Obviously I could have selected some different ways to express my thoughts on Poulter’s remarks.

‘Golf had always been a sport where respect was shown to its icons. That seems to have gone by the wayside.’

Faldo is the only losing European Ryder cup captain this century, and during commentary for this year’s tournament he riled Paul McGinley’s team when he said Sergio Garcia was ‘useless’ during the loss in 2008.

‘Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of what he said,’ Poulter wrote.

‘2008 is the only Ryder Cup we’ve lost in the last 15 years. And he was captain. So who’s useless? I think Faldo might need to have a little look in the mirror.’

Poulter was also critical of eight-time Major winner Watson’s call to drop Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley for both sessions on Saturday at this year’s Ryder Cup, which Europe won 16½-11½.

Poulter said Watson’s decision-making ‘completely baffles me’ and called it ‘utterly bizarre’.

Bishop, a controversial figure in American golf, made 65-year-old Watson the oldest captain in Ryder Cup history.

He recently announced that a task force had been appointed to help solve America’s recent losing streak in the Ryder Cup.
