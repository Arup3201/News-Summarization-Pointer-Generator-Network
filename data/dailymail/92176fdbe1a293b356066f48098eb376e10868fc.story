Graduate Sian Davies died after a fall in 1997

Relatives of a woman who died after falling from a window while she was living in a Maoist commune were told she was travelling abroad when she was in fact fighting for her life in hospital, it has emerged.

Sian Davies, 44, plunged from the second floor of a three-storey south London terraced house rented by cult leaders Aravindan Balakrishnan and wife Chanda.

The graduate, who went to university with Cherie Blair, died in a London hospital from her injuries seven months after the fall in 1997, without her family in Wales ever suspecting she was ill.

Detectives have since said they are now looking at the circumstances surrounding the death of Ms Davies.

The 44-year-old, originally from Llanelli, joined the commune in the mid-1970s and devoted her life and money to its cause.

Her cousin Emyr Morgan spoke today of 
the heartache of Ms Davies's family who were cut out of her life for 
more than two decades before she died.

In
an interview with BBC Wales, he said she 'disappeared' until her death 
when they were informed by police that she died after falling from a 
window.

He also claims the cult wrongly told the 
family Ms Davies had gone to India when she was in hospital with the 
injuries which eventually claimed her life.

The Lambeth property where the cult is alleged to have held three women as 'slaves': Maoist activists Aravindan Balakrishnan and his wife Chanda have been arrested in connection with the alleged offences

The information was given to her family by cult members in the months before her death when they called a number they had for her.

Details about the cult's alleged activities have continued to emerge since police rescued three women from a house in Brixton.

The
alleged victims are a 30-year-old Briton, a 57-year-old Irish woman and
a 69-year-old Malaysian, who are all now being cared for.

It has been reported that the 30-year-old woman in question, named Rose, is the daughter of Ms Davies.

Mr Morgan said the mother of Ms Davies and her sister had also previously both spoken to her on the phone while she was living in the commune.

'My sister said it felt as if it was a very stunted conversation and that every answer was almost being thought through as if to say "Am I OK to say this?",' he told BBC Wales.

'It always felt during the phone conversations that they had that there was somebody else listening to her because it wasn't a natural conversation. There were all these pauses. It was like a transatlantic phone call.'

He said that she told them: 'I'm living this new life. You are no longer part of this life. Don't try and contact me. I'll let you know that I'm OK.

'So it was actually very difficult to see whether she was in any danger at all.'

Mr Balakrishnan, 73, and his wife, 67, were both arrested last week on suspicion of being involved in forced labour and slavery.
