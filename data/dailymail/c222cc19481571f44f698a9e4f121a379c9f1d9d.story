Google is backing a new social network that aims to combat terrorism and gang culture worldwide, it emerged last night.

The Internet giant has confirmed it is funding the Against Violent Extremism (AVE) network for at least two years via its own think-tank, Google Ideas.

The AVE project will link up former violent extremists with victims of terrorism, including Jo Berry, the daughter of Tory MP Anthony Berry who was killed when the IRA bombed a Brighton hotel in 1984. It will also tackle the problem of criminal gangs.

The network was launched in New York yesterday at a presentation hosted by a consortium including Google Ideas and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

Sasha Havlicek, chief executive Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said: 'The goal is to create a global movement against extremism.'

Swede Robert Orell, a former white supremacist who now works as director of anti-Nazi group Exit Sweden, said: 'It's important to network with people from all of the world.'

He added: 'If you are trying to counter extremism but you are too close to the Government you are too close to what many extremist groups see as the enemy.

'Large corporations can be seen as the enemy too, but not to the same extent.'

Google has previously come in for criticism from politicians in Britain and the U.S. for hosting extremist videos on its YouTube channel.

This led to a clean-up operation last year in which Google claimed to have removed 135 videos following government request citing 'national security'.

The driving force behind AVE is 'the belief that there are lessons to be learned between groups combating different forms of extremism, from Islamism to the white power movement', according to its website.

AVE was set-up by Google Ideas following the Summit Against Violent Extremism in Dublin last year.

Google Ideas was founded in order to 'explore the role that technology can play in tackling some of the toughest human challenges'.

It is hoped that the AVE organisation will attract 1,000 members in the next two years.

By this morning, it already counted 416 connections, including 49 'formers' and 18 survivors.

A guide on how to run a charitable group, build a marketing campaign, use social networks, host a virtual meeting and build a website can be found on its website.

Like other social networks, users can upload footage on AVE's YouTube channel to start discussions.

A map shows where each member is located geographically, while there are privacy settings to control what information can be accessed by others.

By late Wednesday, AVE already counted over 400 connections, including 44 "formers" and 18 survivors.
