I've always been supportive of referees. Of course you call the errors, but generally speaking I like to think I have an appreciation of the difficulty of the job referees do and that is reflected in my assessment of their performance.

I do feel managers use referees as a way of deflecting blame away from themselves and their players and that a lot of players and bosses need to look in the mirror before looking at the referee.

But this season, officials are making it more and more difficult for those of us who defend them from inevitable criticism. Some of the errors made have been astonishingly bad, and have left me wondering two things: do they actually know the laws of the game? And secondly, are they actually watching the game properly?

I'm not a fan of managers focusing on referees but I have a lot of sympathy with Everton boss Roberto Martinez when he said this ahead of their Monday night game with West Bromwich Albion: 'They (PGMOL) accept there's been an honest error made but there have been too many now. 

'Referees are part of the game and the error of the referee makes the game what it is. It's tough to take when you've got six or seven big calls which didn't go your way and scorelines could have changed.'

I still believe Martinez needs to address his own shortcomings before he tries to think he knows what's best for match officials, but he has a point nonetheless. 

Everton have had some shocking decisions go against them this season – notably at Manchester City in the Premier League defeat last month.

So this weekend I decided to study four games at random to see how bad the situation was. In each game, there were decisions that weren't just questionable, they were downright terrible:

1. The inexplicable offside decision which robbed Jan Vertonghen and Spurs of a goal against Sunderland. It was high drama right at the end, so the fans were also robbed of a brilliant moment. If you've seen the incident you'll know how bad it is. The linesman remembered one important rule about needing two opponents between the 'attacker' and the goal, but he forgot the even more basic law that you can't be offside in your own half. The referee Chris Foy was in the vicinity as well, but failed to overrule a ridiculous decision. This is a linesman and a referee either not knowing the laws of the game, or forgetting them during the 90 minutes. Either way, it's poor from both.

Replays clearly showed Jan Vertonghen was inside his own half as he ran clear to score a disallowed goal

The Belgian's celebrations were cut short when assistant Stuart Burt inexplicably flagged for offside

Belgium defender Vertonghen couldn't believe his bad luck but Tottenham still went on to win the match 

2. Jose Fonte's handball in the late stages of Southampton's victory at Newcastle. Referee Bobby Madley had a clear view from a good position, so what was he watching? How could he possibly interpret that handball as anything other than a penalty?

3. Bobby Madley's brother Andy also took up a good position on a set-piece as Nottingham Forest threatened Derby County. But despite staring straight at Derby's Jake Buxton grabbing hold of Forest's Michail Antonio and hauling him to the floor, Madley decided not to award a penalty. He let play continue. What was he watching?

4. Mike Jones awarded handball against Leicester's Wes Morgan earlier this season at Anfield when the ball clearly hit the defender's face, so the official has found himself demoted to the Championship where the nightmare continues (in fairness, he was faultless when reffing the FA Cup tie between Blyth Spartans and Birmingham earlier this month).

Wes Morgan was penalised even though the ball clearly hit his face as Raheem Sterling attacked for Liverpool

On Saturday, Jones was at the DW Stadium to control Wigan's 1-1 draw with Blackburn. Wigan's James McClean charged towards Rovers' Marcus Olsson, lunged in late after the ball had gone and took the defender off his feet. It was a horrible challenge, potential leg-breaker and understandably the Blackburn players were livid. Jones decided it was only worthy of a yellow card. 

The linesman was maybe more to blame – he was right on top of the incident. It's a clear red card, so why didn't Jones give it? To make matters worse, McClean headed Wigan's equaliser later in the game.

So why are these glaring errors happening more and more? Honest mistakes are fine, but these are the kind of blunders which if translated and applied to other jobs would get people sacked or killed. A lorry driver doesn't look properly as he approaches a roundabout – it's potentially fatal. If I don't know broadcasting law, I might say something I'm not allowed to and I get sacked from talkSPORT.

So why are so many officials failing to do their jobs properly? These aren't dishonest mistakes of course, but they fall way below the standard that should be set in a professional industry.

My theory is this: goal-line technology has come in and been a success (expensive of course and it isn't used anywhere near as often as its advocates led us to believe it would be, but it's been a positive). The arrival of technology has changed the mindset of officials.

I think subconsciously some referees and linesmen have 'downed tools' and stopped doing their jobs properly, stopped concentrating, stopped watching the game closely. Why? Because they want more technology to come in so they can wash their hands of any responsibility. They know they'll still get paid as professional refs, but they also know there will be less pressure on them as individuals because they'll be able to refer incidents to a 'video ref.'

Back to basics please. Ref it right, or ref off.
