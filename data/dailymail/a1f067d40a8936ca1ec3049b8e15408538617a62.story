Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have cast a 65-year-old model in the latest look book for their high-end fashion line The Row.

Cosmetic entrepreneur Linda Rodin models the twins’ pre-fall 2014 collection alongside Ursula Wallis and Esther de Jong.

It is notable that the child stars-turned-fashion designers, both 27, have shunned fashion industry tradition of hiring teenage models, and instead cast subjects who are well into their adulthood.

Cosmetic entrepreneur: Ms Rodin is known for her namesake cosmetic line which produces the 'Olio Lusso' range of products

Unconventional: Linda Rodin stars in The Row's pre-fall 2014 look book at the age of 65

Ms Rodin in particular was thrilled to have been chosen.

She
 said of her casting in an interview with ELLE.com: ‘They called me to 
come in for a go-see and I thought, “Oh my God! A go-see!” I tried on 
about six outfits. They called me back and said, “We’d love you to do 
it.”’

Ms Rodin observed that
 the Olsen twins have had an older demographic in mind for their 
collection – which features sumptuous, sophisticated overcoats and 
tailored separates – from the very start.

Advanced style: Ms Rodin's beauty products are all-natural and sell at internationally-renowned retailers including Barneys and Colette

Former model: Ms Rodin is a former model and fashion editor for Harper's Bazaar who has recently regained acclaim for her impeccable style

‘They
 really know exactly what they want,’ she said of the sisters. ‘They had
 beautiful mood boards that had older women on them and I saw exactly 
what they were thinking.’

Of
 the resulting photos Ms Rodin told the magazine: ‘I’d be lying to say I
 love all my wrinkles, but going into it I knew what they wanted. . . 
The confidence they gave me was really crucial.  I loved that I was 
respected for who I am.’   

Ms
 Rodin, a former model and Harper’s Bazaar fashion editor, now operates a
 namesake beauty brand that produces the cult ‘Olio Lusso’ range of 
facial products.

Serene: 39-year-old Esther de Jong also appears in The Row's look book

Back on the runway: Ms de Jong, who was a popular model in the early 2000s, has recently begun working again and was featured in the fall 2013 Prada show

Dark beauty: Another model, Ursula Wallis (whose agency prefers her age to remain unknown) is featured as well

Through 
starring roles in ad campaigns for Karen Walker and multiple features on
 the fashion blog Advanced Style, she has drawn widespread admiration 
for her immaculate style as well as her line of natural cosmetics.

‘No
 one ever looked at me when I was 25! It's a riot, but you don't take it
 that seriously,’ she recently told the Wall Street Journal of being 
spotted by fans on the street.

‘I am proud of myself. How many times did I have ideas that I never did anything with? And this, I did.’ she added.
