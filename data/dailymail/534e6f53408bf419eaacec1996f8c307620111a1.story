It may be just 10in high  and look like a children’s toy, but this 3D home printer could revolutionise the way we live.

Technophiles say The Cube, which goes on sale in Britain today, may pave the way for a world in which consumers manufacture many of the things they want instead of buying them. 

The £1,195 desktop printer can make plastic items up to 5.5in square such as toys, doorknobs, party cutlery, kitchen utensils or chess pieces.

The printer could even make a replacement windscreen washer nozzle for your car.

When a design for an object is programmed into it from a memory stick or a wifi link to the internet, The Cube recreates it by building up fine layers of hot melted PLA plastic, which is flexible, or ABS, which is rigid.

The plastics are recyclable and compostable and the cartridges come in 16 colours, some of which glow in the dark.

Technophiles say the £1,195 desktop printer may pave the way for a world in which consumers manufacture many of the things they want instead of buying them.

But this technology doesn’t come cheap, with each cartridge costing £52.80.

They contain 320g of plastic, which is enough to make 53 mobile phone cases.

The Cube comes with 25 free designs, including chess pieces, napkin holders, jewellery and toys such as cups for a tea party set and a rocket ship.

In future, users will be able to purchase others on the web from specialist design companies at the touch of a button. Users can also create their own designs to be turned into a 3D product.

But the process can be time-consuming, taking more than an hour to make a single chess piece. 

The Cube, which is 10in high, 10in wide and 13in deep, is made by a firm called Cubify.

It goes on sale at Currys and PC World, which claim it is so simple that even children can use it.

Although 3D printing is still in its infancy and current uses are limited, technology websites are already excited about the possibilities.

Reviewers at the popular Pocket-lint site described The Cube as ‘incredible stuff’, concluding: ‘It’s the future right here.’

But experts claim families will need to wait for several generations of the home 3D printer before they can buy one that is genuinely useful.

There are also concerns about the technology being used for crime or terrorism after American law student Cody Wilson made and successfully fired a plastic gun from parts created on a 3D printer in May this year.

The blueprints were posted online by the self-described anarchist and downloaded 100,000 times before the US government ordered them to be removed.
