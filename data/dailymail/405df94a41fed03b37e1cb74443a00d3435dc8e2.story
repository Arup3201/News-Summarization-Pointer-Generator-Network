Oscar Pistorius was expected to take to the stand today to testify at his murder trial but court was immediately adjourned because one of the judge's two assessors was unwell in hospital.

The double-amputee Paralympic champion is facing 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder for killing lover Reeva Steenkamp.

Defence lawyers for the runner, who is the only eyewitness in the case, were due to begin their case today after four weeks of prosecution-led testimony.

But Judge Thokozile Masipa said that one of her two assessors, legal experts who are helping her with the case, was unwell and that the trial had to be delayed until April 7 as the court would not be properly constituted.

Prosecutors took 15 days to lay out 
their case against the 27-year-old, arguing he deliberately killed 
Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year by firing four
 rounds from a 9 mm pistol through a closed toilet door.

Several
 neighbours testified to hearing a woman's terrified screams before a 
volley of shots, countering Pistorius' assertions that he mistook 
Steenkamp for an intruder hiding in the toilet cubicle in the middle of 
the night.

The world-famous athlete pleaded not guilty to the murder charge and also not guilty to three other firearm-related counts.

After prosecutors wrapped up their case against the Olympian this week, one of the defence lawyers said Pistorius would likely testify.

Legal experts say Pistorius, 27, is expected to testify because he has admitted killing Steenkamp, 29, and must explain to the court why so it can take his version into account.

It is common in South Africa for the defendant to be the first person the defense calls, the experts said, unless there are exceptional reasons why another witness should testify ahead of him.

Pistorius shot Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, through the closed door of a toilet cubicle in his home in the night, later saying he mistook her for an intruder

When Pistorius testifies he would also 
open himself up to cross-examination and likely uncomfortable questions 
from chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel.

The trial has
 gripped South Africa and millions of athletics fans around the world 
who saw Pistorius as a symbol of triumph over physical adversity.

So far, he has been a spectator in his trial, alone in the dock. The athlete dressed neatly and spoke softly, if at all, during adjournments.

He said this week that it was a tough time and there is 'a lot ahead of us', mindful perhaps that the impression he makes on Judge Thokozile Masipa, who will deliver a verdict, could mean as much for his fate as disputed testimony from experts, neighbors and acquaintances.
