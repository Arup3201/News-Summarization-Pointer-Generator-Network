With vast stretches of open water, forests, lush green scenery and England's highest peak, the Lake District is one of Britain's favourite tourist spots.

But a tourist board in a run-down south London district have written to Cumbrian authorities demanding they change their name.

The South Norwood Tourist Board, based in the borough of Croydon, said that there is only one official lake in the Lake District - so the title should be dropped.

Outstanding beauty: Bassenthwaite Lake which officially is the Lake District's only lake

And as their area of London has two lakes, they are demanding the right to use it themselves.

The
self-styled tourist group run history tours and walks of south London 
and insist their scenery is every bit as good as in Cumbria.

They said South Norwood has a better claim to 
the title of the Lake District as it has two lakes - the 116-acre 
Norwood Country Park Lake and 28-acre South Norwood Lake.

ANNUAL TOURIST NUMBERSLake District: 16millionSouth Norwood: Zero

LAKESLake District: One - Bassenthwaite Lake (its others are not officially lakes)South Norwood: Two - Norwood Country Park Lake and South Norwood Lake

TOURIST ATTRACTIONSLake District: Lake Windermere, Scaffel Pike which is England's tallest mountain, Catbells Lakeland Walk and Wordsworth HouseSouth Norwood: South Norwood clock tower, Crystal Palace Football Club, South Norwood Country Park

FAMOUS RESIDENTSLake District: The Lake Poets: William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Robert SoutheySouth Norwood: Pickles the dog who recovered the World Cup trophy

From William Wordsworth to Donald Campbell, some famous names have been associated with the Lake District.

In contrast, in South Norwood they have Pickles the dog, who found the stolen World Cup trophy hidden under a bush in 1966.

Famous sites in the area include South 
Norwood clock tower, Crystal Palace Football Club and the house where 
Arthur Conan Doyle lived.

Ian Bone, an associate of the South Norwood Tourist Board, said: 'We have got two fantastic lakes here for fly-fishing, walks and everything you could wish for.

'The so-called Lake District in 
Cumbria has in fact only one lake, Bassenthwaite Lake, all the rest 
being styled meres, tarns and waters.

'South Norwood has two at least, and a possible third.

'SNTB has therefore decided we have a 
greater claim to be styling ourselves the Lake District and we have now 
informed the Cumbrian authorities to desist from using the title pending
further action on our part.'

Around 16million people visit the Lake District every year.

Mr Bone added: 'It's all very well claiming the title and getting millions of visitors every year, but in the end it's a false claim - the place only has one lake.

'Our lakes are gorgeous and underused and we have written to the Cumbria authorities saying we have the right to also call ourselves the Lake District.

'It is just so beautiful around South Norwood, we really are London's answer to the Lake District.'

Cumbria Tourism hit back and said that the 'lakes' in south London are 'merely ponds'.

Ian Stephens, the managing director of Cumbria Tourism, said: 'South Norwood has three ponds.

Unsightly: Run-down Croydon town. A self-appointed tourist board claim it should be named the Lake District - as it has more lakes

'We have England's longest lake in the shape of Windermere, England's deepest lake, Wast Water, 14 other lakes and hundreds of meres, tarns, and other bodies of water.

'I'm sure the ponds of South Norwood have their merits and it is flattering that they wish to emulate our natural environment, albeit in a modest way.

'However, I don't recall South Norwood being immortalised by great poets like Wordsworth and W.H. Auden and I can't believe that it will be a substitute for the magnificent natural environment to be found here in Cumbria.

'So citizens of Norwood, please get yourself to Euston Station and in under 3 hours you can treat yourself to a slice of the real Lake District.'

South Norwood resident Simon Grayson, 45, said: 'South Norwood is a bit run down and it's hardly going to compete with the Lake District National Park.

'The two lakes and parks are lovely, but I must admit I'd rather take a trip to Cumbria than we wandering around a district of Croydon.'
