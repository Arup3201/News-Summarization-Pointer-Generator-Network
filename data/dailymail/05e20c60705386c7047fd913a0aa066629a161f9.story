Igor Baksht planned to give his 13-year-old niece a PlayStation 4 for Christmas, so he went to a Stapleton Walmart last Friday to buy one.

The employee who assisted him at the store took the gaming console out of a locked cabinet and told him it was previously returned, Baksht told WPTV.

The associate mentioned to him the box felt heavy, but at the time Baksht felt there was nothing strange about that since he'd never bought one before and wouldn't know how much it weighs.

Scammed: Instead of a PlayStation 4, Igor Baksht told KMGH he found two bags filled with small rocks that had been duct taped closed in a gift he planned to give his niece

It wasn't until he was getting ready to wrap the gift when he opened the box.

'Just to make sure everything was inside, that all the contents were inside, all the games were inside,' he said. 'When I opened it, I said, "Oh my God."' 

Instead of the console, inside the box were two bags filled with small rocks that had been duct taped closed.

The original store was closed by then, and Baksht was also turned away at a 24-hour Walmart. He returned to the store he purchased the rock-filled box from Saturday morning.

'He said they cannot do anything about it because they don't have proof, how it came in, nothing,' Baksht said about trying to return the console, which starts at $399 at the retail chain.

'I never stole anything in my life. The most criminal thing that I've did, I got a driving ticket,' he added. 

Stuck: Baksht says he tried to return the console for an exchange or a refund, but was told Walmart couldn't verify they had sold him the rocks

Deceptive: The sales associate that retrieved the PlayStation bundle for Baksht said it felt heavy, but the man didn't question what he thought was the console's normal weight

He tried to call the story and Walmart's corporate office, to no avail. 

Then on Christmas Eve, he caught a break when a store manager phoned him, saying he could bring the box back to the store and refunded the money Baksht paid.

A spokesperson for Walmart told 7NEWS there was no way to verify the man's story, but they wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Baksht joked that if he hadn't checked the box before wrapping it, there would have been some tears, from both himself and his niece. 

Technology-related Christmas scams happen nearly every year, with criminals exhibiting varying degrees of creativity.

In 2005, one boy who thought he was getting an iPod video instead unwrapped a sealed piece of mystery meat in an Apple box, ABC reported.
