A worrying number of shy and book smart children are being labelled as 'mentally ill' by doctors who  are under pressure from parents to give them a diagnosis according to a top psychiatrist.

Professor Sir Simon Wessely, the new head of the Royal College of Psychiatrists says that there is a growing trend of medicating normal traits in children by the insistence of overbearing parents.

Pushy parents are getting GPs to prescribe drugs such as Ritalin and Prozac to treat serious disorders creating a huge rise in antidepressants and drug use among young children.

Wrong diagnosis: Professor Sir Simon Wessely, the new head of the Royal College of Psychiatrists says that there is a growing trend of medicating normal traits in children by the insistence of overbearing parents

Along with mental health diagnosis, one of the most commonly medicated disorders is attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD).

If a child is seen as being overactive, but does not
 necessarily have ADHD, he could be prescribed drugs, Professor Wessely said.

He told The Times:
 'Certain behaviour carry stigma and there's less stigma if it's associated with a disorder. Often it's about the avoidance of guilt.

'You get obvious pressures from parents: we've all been to middle class dinner parties where so many parents seem to say their kids are mildly autistic and yet they've just got into Oxford. And you think 'I don't really buy that one'...

Around
 three to seven per cent of children, or 400,000, are believed to have 
ADHD in the UK, with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve 
their concentration at school.

According to recent figures, the use of ADHD drugs has tripled over the past decade and antidepressants usage has shot up too.

Professor
 Wessely said that it is becoming less common for children to be 
labelled as 'shy' but they are more likely to be branded as having a 
social phobia or a behavioural problem.

And
 even schools are benefitting from mislabelling pupils, says Professor Wessely, as the more special 
needs children in a school, the more funds they'll get.

However, some experts claim that many disorders have no merit at all, and are in fact, made up.

Methylphenidate (Ritalin) tablets: Pushy parents are getting GPs to prescribe drugs such as Ritalin for young children

Paediatric neurologist Dr Richard 
Saul, based in Chicago, believes that ADHD simply ‘doesn’t exist’ and is being used as a 
mask for less serious problems.

Dr
 Saul argues that children are being misdiagnosed.

‘ADHD makes a great excuse,’ Dr Saul 
said in his book, ‘ADHD does not exist: The truth about Attention 
Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder.’

‘The
 diagnosis can be an easy-to-reach-for crutch. Moreover, there’s an 
attractive element to an ADHD diagnosis, especially in adults - it can 
be exciting to think of oneself as involved in many things at once, 
rather than stuck in a boring rut.’

Echoing Dr Saul's views, a group of 
researchers from Australia and the Netherlands said in November that the
 diagnosis of ADHD may have become too broad.

A
 wider classification of symptoms for ADHD in the psychiatric ‘bible’ 
used by the profession has led to a steep rise in diagnosis and 
prescriptions for medication, the study warned.

The group of researchers said there was now a risk of over diagnosis which could fuel scepticism about the disorder.

In addition, stretched resources may mean some seriously affected children do not get medical help, or they are undertreated.
