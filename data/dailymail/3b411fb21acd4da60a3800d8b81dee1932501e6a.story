Britain is set for a late-summer scorcher this weekend with temperatures set to hit 22C.

Forecasters said today that the unseasonable dry spell that has enchanted the nation over the past few days will continue.

After the coldest August since 1993, Britons have seen a warm and sunny start to September and the settled weather is set to carry on to the end of next week. 

Blue skies: Spectators at the first day of the Goodwood Revival 2014 watch the opening airshow in almost clear-blue skies today, which included the world's only two Lancaster bombers still in flight. The weather will stay warm and dry but cloudy

Turning orange: This wall of  Virginia Creeper is already starting to change colour at Selwyn College, Cambridge, in a sign that autumn is on its way

Today  saw a bright and sunny day across the country, with the best of the sun in the West and top temperatures of 22C in London.Tomorrow is expected to be cloudier, but once the sun breaks through in the middle of the afternoon it is set to be a scorcher.

Met Office meteorologist Laura Young said Saturday and Sunday's temperatures will smash September's average maximum of 16.5C. 

'We're looking at fine and dry weather all weekend, no wind and daytime temperatures across the country in the late-teens to early 20s,' she said.

Park life: Park-goers enjoy the Autumn sunshine at the Cambridge University Botanic Gardens. More good weather is forecast for the weekend

Almost over ... but not quite: The Boston Ivy at Cambridge University's Botanic Gardens had already turned a deep red in parts in a sign the the summer is almost over

Cold start: After the coldest August since 1993, Britons have seen a warm and sunny start to September and the settled weather is set to carry on to the end of next week

Though slightly cooler in the north, highs of 17C  are still more than the September average. 

However, sun-worshipers hoping to top up their tans one last time before winter will have to be quick-footed, as light clouds look set to cover the skies for most of the weekend.   

'We're not looking at thick, dark cloud,' said Ms Young. 'But it is going to be cloudy with good periods of sunshine between the cloud. However, the cloud will dominate the sunshine this weekend.

'That said, the cloud will lock temperatures in at night with most places seeing highs of 13C or 14C well into the evening.'

And, she said, the warm weather is set to continue well into next week. 

'At the moment we are looking at another week or so of fairly good weather,' she added. 'We know it will break at some point, we just don't know when. But there's a good chance it will come back again later.' 

Not Halloween yet! Meanwhile, in Romsey, Hampshire, Neill Cairns inspects his pumpkins under the hot sun. In the next week the farm will harvest 700,000 pumpkins to be distributed to the major supermarkets in time for Halloween

Pumpkin pickers: Migrant workers, mainly from Bulgaria, laugh as they enjoy the weather. Pumpkins at the farm will be cut from the fields and lined up in rows before they are sold

Today, temperatures soared as Britons across the country ventured outdoors to soak up the rays. 

In Cambridge, visitors to the famous Cambridge University Botanic Garden basked in the sunshine today, enjoying the spectacular Autumnal scenes in the 40 acre city centre gardens, where the leaves have already started to change as the UK enjoys above average temperatures. 

And spectators at the first day of the Goodwood Revival 2014 watch the opening airshow in almost clear-blue skies today, which included the world's only two Lancaster bombers still in flight in a special parade to mark the 75th Anniversary of RAF Westhampnett, West Sussex, the base around which the modern-day circuit was built.

The 'West Sussex at War' parade honour the part the airfield and its surrounding towns and villages played in the Second World War, and involved more than 600 vehicles on the circuit.
