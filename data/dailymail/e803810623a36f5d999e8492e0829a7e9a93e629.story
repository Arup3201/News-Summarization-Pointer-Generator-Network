Spoken out: Mike Barton, Chief Constable for Durham Constabulary, has been flown out to Copenhagen's notorious 'shooting galleries' by the BBC as research

A senior police officer has been given a platform by the BBC to call for heroin to be given out free to drug addicts.

Mike Barton, the Chief Constable of Durham Constabulary, argues that heroin users should be given drugs paid for by the taxpayer to ‘take money out of drug dealers’ pockets’.

He says it ‘isn’t practical’ for the police simply to arrest drug addicts and says he is ‘proud to be a social worker’ as well as a law enforcer.

Mr Barton was flown to Copenhagen to make a short documentary for the programme, Inside Out.

In the piece, he visits drug consumption rooms - also known as shooting galleries - where drug addicts are given free needles and can take their drugs without fear of arrest.

He tells viewers: ‘We should provide the heroin, the state should provide the heroin, and we take the 600 pounds out of the drug dealers’ pocket.

‘I know there will be those in high office who will be angry at me saying this, but I don’t want to be the former Chief Constable or the retired Chief Constable who says this.

‘It’s time a serving Chief Constable spoke out.’

Last night anti-cannabis campaigners criticised his comments and attacked the BBC for commissioning the programme.

Mary Brett, from Cannabis Skunk Sense, said the Chief Constable’s comments ‘beggar belief’ and were ‘condoning’ drug use.

She said there were huge problems with police giving away heroin - including addicts blighting communities while hanging around waiting to be given their next fix.

She also argued the criminals who currently make money from drugs would simply switch to other illegal ways of making money.

Mrs Brett criticised the BBC for paying to provide a platform for Mr Barton’s views, and accused the Corporation of deliberately chasing controversy to boost ratings.

She told the Mail: ‘This is what the BBC does. The BBC just wants its controversial programmes and high profile programmes to get people to watch and listen.’

The row came amid figures showing police are already taking action against fewer people for using cannabis.

In 2012, the Mail revealed how senior police had decided to adopt a ‘less robust enforcement approach’ on possession of the Class B drug.

Over the course of the year to September 2013, the number of formal warnings issued for cannabis use fell from 72,171 to 65,969 - a fall of nine per cent. In 2009, almost 100,000 warnings were issued.

Mrs Brett said it was the an indication the police were ‘no longer bothering’.

Last year Mr Barton hit the headlines when he said the war on drugs had ‘comprehensively failed’ and compared it to failed prohibition-era efforts to ban alcohol.

In the new documentary, he says only a fifth of his work is law enforcement and crime fighting, and around half is ‘concern for safety’.

Anti-drugs campaigners have blasted Mr Barton's appreciation for these schemes which 'condone' drug use

‘So when you accuse me of being a social worker I’m proud to be a social worker as well as a tough law enforcer,’ he says.

He is questioned by anti-drugs author and journalist Peter Hitchens, who calls for the police to actively pursue drug users to deter them from buying and taking more drugs.

‘I’m advocating the pursuit of the possessors of drugs rather than the pursuit of the dealers of drugs,’ Mr Hitchens says.

‘If anyone is caught in possession arrested prosecuted and if found guilty they are punished in a deterrent fashion to deter them from future action and to deter other people from possessing drugs.’

But Mr Barton says there are 1,700 registered addicts in his force area and only 1,200 police officers.

‘You can’t just say to cops ‘go out there and arrest people until it stops’ because that isn’t practical.’

He adds: ‘I know what I’m saying is controversial and some politicians don’t like it.’
