A Chinese model has been given a suspended sentence of nine months in jail after posting racy photos of herself dressed as a policewoman online.

The revealing pictures of Wang Xiaomeng, 23, showed her getting dressed in an official-looking police woman's uniform.

As she sits on a bed wearing just a tight police shirt and underwear, she is seen rolling on a pair of sheer black stockings over her naked legs.

In another snap she leans forward in her unbuttoned shirt to show off her lacy black bra.

But the pictures - taken to 
promote a new detective novel - created a furious row when Xiaomen 
tweeted three of the snaps on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter.

Together with the photographs, she wrote a playful scenario.

'As
a new cop in my hometown, I need to learn the basics. As one of the 
flowers of the force, I am under pressure. I have to eat and drink with 
government leaders every day. I am using my flower status to dine with 
the leaders and win contracts for projects and investments!'

She took the photos down shortly after the social networking company received 14 complaints

But her blog has already been re-posted more than 500 times and received more than 200 comments.

According to the Beijing News, Wang moved to Beijing after graduating from high school five years ago.

Model behaviour: Xiaomen had told the court she'd been paid 300 GBP for 
the modelling session. 'The costume was just a prop, I was so ignorant,'
she added

Judges in Fengtai, Beijing, found her guilty of falsely impersonating a policewoman and sentenced her to nine months in prison, suspended for a year.

Xiaomen had told the court she'd been paid £300 for the modelling session.

'The costume was just a prop, I was so ignorant,' she added.
