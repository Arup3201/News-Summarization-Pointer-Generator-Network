As Luis Suarez’s first goal went in on Tuesday night, Manuel Pellegrini sank back in his seat. It was hard to tell whether the look was one of exasperation or resignation.

Pellegrini had a year to prepare for this, a year to solve the problems that characterised his team’s defeat against Barcelona last season. It took just a quarter of an hour for him to realise he hadn’t managed it.

For all that Manchester City found a way back into this game in the second half, the decisive period was the opening half-hour. It told us that City continue to chase their tails when it comes to finding the right template in the Champions League.

They grabbed something from this game by chasing it hard. Their energy and will found them a way and Joe Hart’s penalty save at the death means that the Barclays Premier League champions head to Spain next month in better spirits than they might have mustered.

The truth is, however, that teams do not make significant headway in this tournament by chasing games, especially at home. Dominance comes from solid possession. It comes from control and method.

City continue to invest in their squad but nights like this raise valid questions about whether the team is actually moving forward.

If this seems unkind given the stellar nature of the opposition, so be it. This is the company City have made it their stated intention to keep.

Nobody expects them to dominate the ball against Luis Enrique’s extraordinarily gifted team. The one way to make sure you fail against Barcelona is by trying to copy them.

Nevertheless, City must realise they simply must do better. They must find a way to dictate passages of play against the best opposition, if not the whole game. There remains a lack of authority to their play in Europe.

It is not just Barcelona who have come to the Etihad Stadium and messed the home team around for periods. Bayern Munich have done it. AS Roma have done it. Even Napoli and CSKA Moscow have done it.

One senses that Pellegrini and football director Txiki Begiristain know exactly what the problem is. It goes right to the heart of the team — to the centre of the City midfield. This is where foundations for victories at this level are built. This is where momentum builds. It comes from possession, from the rhythm of simply moving the ball.

City have invested in the Brazilian duo Fernandinho and Fernando over the last two summers in a bid to construct a platform. Frank Lampard has added something domestically in that area this season. On Tuesday, James Milner began the game there with Fernando.

Still, though, City look a million miles short. Certainly they do when compared to players like Barcelona’s Sergio Busquets and, for example, Bayern’s Bastian Schweinsteiger, or even Chelsea’s Nemanja Matic.

On Tuesday night, City missed Yaya Toure, of course. The Ivorian was suspended.

Even Toure, though, has looked muddled at times in Europe — not knowing whether to go or hold —and that is perhaps why City’s search has led them to the door of the French international midfielder Paul Pogba of Juventus.

The former Manchester United player will not come cheap this summer but City’s interest is real. He is the right age and it is not hard to see where Pogba’s physicality would improve this team.

On Tuesday, Fernando and Milner were humbled from the start. The Brazilian had a wretched night.

His first contribution was to give the ball straight to Busquets. The subsequent pass almost landed on Lionel Messi’s toe. Some start that would have been.

Ten minutes later the City midfielder erred again, passing the ball to Suarez who raced through on goal.

During a 30-minute spell during the middle of the opening half, City were second best by a rather distressing distance. Messi was almost impossible to track, sometimes dropping so deep he could almost shake hands with his own central defenders.

When he moved, he did so in a manner alien to those in blue. Suarez was similarly difficult to follow and Neymar, operating from a starting position on the left side, timed his forays infield with devastating instinct.

It was in turn thrilling and demoralising to watch and City really should have been able to come up with a more convincing answer.

Everything Barcelona did was straight from the Nou Camp’s most classic playbook. City have invested money and thought in preparing Pellegrini’s squad for nights like this and at times here it was difficult to work out where it had all gone.

Certainly City improved in the second half but it was all rather too late. At the end there was a sense of relief that the damage had not been greater.

That, however, isn’t what European football is about. It is not about relief or small mercies.

It’s about winning, it’s about moving forward. City, undeniably, remain inert.
