The BBC was accused of more ‘leftie bias’ in its coverage of Baroness Thatcher’s death yesterday after its main news website was filled with negative articles about the former Prime Minister.

At one point, the corporation’s online home page contained seven stories emphasising the controversies of Lady Thatcher’s time in office and repeating accusations made by her critics, including the suggestion she was ‘racist’.

Readers reacted angrily in a second day of fury at the BBC’s coverage, accusing it of being ‘out of touch’ and ‘terrifically biased’.

The BBC has faced criticism for its 'biased' coverage which focuses on the former prime ministers controversies

Margaret Thatcher's legacy and controversies has been scrutinised  by the broadcaster - and subsequently slammed by readers

So far, the corporation has received 766 complaints over its coverage of Lady Thatcher’s death.

Instead of focusing on the tributes flooding in from around the globe, for much of the morning editorial chiefs chose to give top prominence to an article about left-wing anger over the prospective cost of her funeral.

The BBC says it has not yet decided whether to play a Wizard of Oz song driven onto the charts by a virulent anti-Thatcher hate campaign.

The track – Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead – has risen to No 10 in the midweek charts on the back of a Facebook and Twitter campaign by those revelling in Baroness Thatcher’s death.

If it is still in the official charts at the weekend, the BBC will be forced to decide whether to give it airtime during its weekly top-40 countdown on Radio 1.

A spokesman said: ‘We will make a decision when the final chart positions are clear.’

Beneath it, prominence was given to an 
article reporting Australian foreign minister Bob Carr, who had 
described Baroness Thatcher as ‘unabashedly racist’ in a television 
interview.

There was no corresponding article reporting her many fans.

Another piece, entitled ‘She never really understood sport’, accused Lady Thatcher’s Conservative government of presiding over a series of ‘devastating sporting disasters’.

A fourth article focused on her celebrated ‘Right to Buy’ scheme, which allowed council house tenants to buy their properties, extending home-ownership to millions across the country.

But instead of celebrating the policy’s achievements, the article, entitled ‘Right to Buy: A Tainted Gift?’ gave prominence to critics who said it led to a shortage of social housing.

Writing on political blog Guido Fawkes, one reader said: ‘Even the Biased-BBC’s headline “Hague justifies cost of funeral” – is terrifically biased. No other paper is even questioning the cost.

‘They are as out of touch and as doomed as the Guardian.’

Another said: ‘The BBC has become a case for privatisation.

'Then these lefty fat cats feeding greedily off the public will see whether we want to pay for their propaganda, or their endless interviews with yesterday’s loony left. And we’d get the proceeds of the sale towards debt.’

A third added: ‘The only mistake the Lady made was not to sell the BBC to the highest bidder.’

Richard Christopher tweeted: ‘Still the Anti Brit BBC gets away with leftie bias.’

Yesterday, a BBC spokesman said the news website displayed a selection of ‘recent stories’ chosen by an editor and the ‘controversy’ over the cost of the funeral was ‘the top story at the time’.

He added: ‘A variety of news stories about  Baroness Thatcher, exploring a number of angles and featuring a range of voices and opinions, have been displayed on the home page throughout the day.’
