Vacuum cleaners, fireworks and trips to the vet are all things dogs are known to be scared of, but this border collie is petrified of more or less everything.

Jack cowers under a table whenever he hears doorbells or phones ringing and even the ping of a microwave can cause him to scarper.

The hapless hound also runs scared at the sound of people sneezing and cutlery scraping against plates, making it difficult to find a quiet enough home for the petrified pup.

Staff at the Dogs Trust, in Ilfracombe, Devon, have to talk in whispers whenever they're near him - and even then he runs off and hides if he can hear them.

Jack wears a special jacket designed to feel like he is constantly being cuddled but he still has to be moved around the building so he can be in the quietest spots. 

His old owners, who took him in when he was a puppy, had to give him back because his anxiety was too much for them to cope with.

Pam Stow, the charity's rehoming centre manager, said dogs usually become acclimatised to everyday sounds over time.

But Jack is unable to adapt to the sort of background noises we barely notice and each time he hears one he becomes distressed.

He is currently spending time with an animal behaviour specialist who is trying to help him conquer his fears. 

Despite Jack's skittish tendencies, Ms Stow says Jack is a warm, affectionate dog and perfect for rehoming.

She said: 'Poor Jack is quite nervous and lots of things are scary for him.

'We are looking for a quiet and understanding home with new owners who will learn to help him cope with his phobias and enjoy life.

'Due to his wariness, it may take a few visits for Jack to bond with his new owners so they will need to be patient.

'He does like smaller dogs, but would prefer to be the only dog in the home as he does like his own quiet space'.
