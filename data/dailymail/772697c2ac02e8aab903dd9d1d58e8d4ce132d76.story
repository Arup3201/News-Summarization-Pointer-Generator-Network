First we had the Kate Middleton Effect. Then we had the Duchess Effect. And now, a mere three days after his birth and following just one public appearance, we seem to be witnessing the Prince George Effect.

But while his mother Kate is cited as one of the most influential figures within the fashion industry, with anything she wears immediately flying off shelves and into wardrobes, her baby is boosting sales of a much more simple item: swaddling muslins.

The £12 printed white aden + anais cloth in which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge wrapped their baby son before leaving the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, has already sold out.

The patterned muslin cloth in which 
his proud parents swaddled him for their first public appearance as a 
family was just visible poking out from beneath his white blanket - and 
it's a brand that has already proved popular with celebrity parents 
including Jools and Jamie Oliver, Jessica Alba and Peaches Geldof. such 
as Jamie Oliver and Jessica Alba.

The
100 per cent cotton design was white with a pattern of pale green cartoon
 birds, named the Sweet Bird Print. It comes in a pack of four called 
Jungle Jam, retailing at £44.95, with the other clothes decorated with monkeys, elephants and giraffes.

Company founder Raegan Moya-Jones told the Telegraph: 'We are truly grateful and so delighted that the couple chose to debut the prince in aden + anais, it is such an honour! We wish the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge many congratulations on the birth of their son.'

But Kate is not the first royal to sport an aden + anais swaddling.

Andrea Albert Pierre 
Casiraghi - the eldest son of Caroline, Princess of Hanover and her 
second husband Stefano Casiraghi, and the grandson of Rainier III, Prince
 of Monaco and Grace Kelly - used one with his first-born son Sacha, born in March.

And in terms of Hollywood royalty, aden + anais is a household name.

Sienna Miller, Beyoncé, Charlize 
Theron, Jaunary Jones, Mel B, Jennifer Garner, Hilary Duff, Jack Osborne, January Jones, Doutzen Kroes and Sandra Bullock are 
just some of the stars who are doting fans of the brand.

Selma
 Blair, Jessica Alba, Lily Allen, Robbie Williams and Khloe Kardashian 
have also covered their little babies in one of their swaddles.

The
 aden + anais swaddles measure 120cm x 120cm square, and their extra 
large size also makes them handy for use as pram shades, breast-feeding covers, portable sheets and, if you're Peaches Geldof, adult scarves.

The Super Star 
swaddle is one of the most popular designs in the range with its bold 
star print (which also comes in yellow, green and orange and has also 
been spotted on Jamie Oliver and Charlize Theron).

The swaddles are made of 100 per cent cotton muslin, and the brand claims that the more you wash them the softer they become.

They are available in stores nationwide and on adenandanais.co.uk.

The shawl in which Prince George was wrapped to leave the hospital cost £45

A small family firm in Nottinghamshire has had an 'unprecedented' run of orders after Kate and William swaddled Prince George in one of their christening shawls.

GH Hurt and Son Ltd, which has a long-standing connection with the Royal Family, sent the couple one of their £45 merino shawls.

It was identical to one William had when he was a baby.

Gillian Taylor, its director, said the company felt 'honoured'.

A source from the firm said: ‘The phone has been ringing off the hook and we have been taking more online orders than we have ever seen before.

'We had no idea what they were going to use it until we saw the television footage ourselves. We were dancing with joy.'
