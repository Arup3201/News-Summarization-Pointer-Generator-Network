Iker Casillas wants Real Madrid to tear up his contract so he can join Arsenal on a free transfer, according to reports in Spain.

The Spain keeper is an institution at the Bernabeu but lost his No 1 spot to Diego Lopez two seasons ago and now only starts for Real in the Champions League.

And with Madrid having signed Costa Rica keeper Keylor Navas, Casillas will look for a new challenge, according to El Confidencial.

Gunning for a move: Iker Casillas is reportedly keen to switch from Real Madrid to Arsenal

Arsenal are long-term admirers of the 33-year-old and have been linked with him extensively this year.

One stumbling block could be that they have already agreed a deal for a goalkeeper, £3.2million for Nice's Colombian David Ospina.

With the departure of Lukasz Fabianski to Swansea, however, Arsenal are a bit light on keepers so Casillas may still be pursued even if Ospina signs.

That could leave the future of Gunners No 1 Wojciech Szczesny in doubt as Casillas would surely not want to warm the bench at the Emirates after his months of frustration in Madrid.
