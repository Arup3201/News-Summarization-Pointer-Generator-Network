A bright-eyed young girl sits on the set of a TV studio, conducting one of her first ever interviews after being selected from a crop of nationwide hopefuls to win a prestigious modelling contract.

Undeniably beautiful and destined for greatness, the 13-year-old's selection as a magazine cover girl has already drawn criticism from media groups as being little more than paedophilia.

Facing some difficult questions for someone her age - she has just turned 14 after her competition win - she is asked by reporter Tracy Grimshaw if there is anything she would not consider doing in her future career as a model.

No way: With a crinkled up nose and a curled lip, a 13-year-old Miranda Kerr looks virtually disgusted by the thought of having her picture taken in lingerie

'You like the idea of travelling?' The question, posed by TV reporter Tracy Grimshaw, left, is met with an enthusiastic 'Yep' by the gangly teenaged Miranda

Starting out: When asked why she wants to be a model - if the answer isn't literally written on her face - Miranda replies, 'I just think it'd be really fun. I love being with people and I love fashion'

The young girl's feelings are quite clear on the subject, saying: 'I won't be doing any lingerie shots or anything like that.'

The year was 1997 and the teenage girl is Miranda Kerr, who would go on to be one of the world's most recognised lingerie models.

The clip was featured in Australian channel ABC's Family Confidential programme on Tuesday night, which offered a unique insight into the model's family life.

It did not deliver the anticipated answer to why Miranda's close-knit family now feels that it has been shut out of the model's day-to-day life. They claim they have not seen Miranda or her son Flynn for more than a year - not since the break-up of her marriage to Hollywood star Orlando Bloom.

But even her earliest of interviews provided a hint that Miranda wanted to leave her country upbringing behind for the bright lights of the world's biggest cities.

Grimshaw asks Miranda why she wants to be a model at all, and her answer is simple: 'I just think it's be really fun. I love being with people and I love fashion.'

In Gunnedah: Therese and John Kerr spoke warmly of how the family were all together in the norht-eastern NSW town, and how they yearned for that family closeness again

When Grimshaw asks 'And you like the idea of travelling', the answer is an immediate and resounding 'Yep!'.

In Tuesday night's documentary, it was clear that the rest of the Kerr family did not share their famous family member's desire to see the world.

The show started with Miranda's mother and father - Therese and John - reminiscing about the simple life in Gunnedah, a town in New South Wales (300 miles from Sydney). Throughout the interview they, as well as Miranda's grandmother Ann, are at pains to show that they are still country folk who extol the virtues of a simple life.

Grandmother and brother: Ann says she fears that her great-grandson is missing out on important family time, while Matthew says both Miranda and their mother Therese are both women who like to be in control

John especially made his feelings clear, saying he wished Miranda had never gone into modelling and that she had married a 'nobody' instead of someone famous.

He almost proudly told the story that he didn't know who Orlando Bloom was when told his daughter had started up a relationship, adding: 'I'd heard the name... I'm not one for movies.'

He added: 'After what I know now I would rather she did just marry a nobody because you really can't get that family time by yourself.'

And on the topic of his grandson Flynn, his hopes were once again homespun ones.

Happy families: An undated photograph handed out by the ABC ahead of the Family Confidential programme shows the Kerrs - Matthew, Miranda, Therese and John - after one of Miranda's many early successes

Grown up: Matthew, Miranda, Therese and John are older in this photo, and Miranda has clearly grown into the beautiful looks that would take her around the world - and away from her family

He said: 'What I'd like to do as a grandfather would be to teach Flynn how to milk a cow, ride a horse, those country things.'

Similarly, Miranda's grandmother Ann lamented the fact that she hadn't seen Flynn, now three, as often as she would have liked.

She said: 'I miss the baby and I think he's missing out on family, that closeness that we have always had. It's very nice where they are but nothing like Australia, nothing, and I think hopefully Flynn might end up here. We just keep our fingers crossed.'

A source tells MailOnline, however, that Miranda does stay close to her family.

'Miranda is totally committed to her family and in regular contact, she recently flew out her cousins to so they could spend Christmas together,' said the friend.

'Miranda directly employs her dad, brother, aunt and uncle. Her career was never going to keep her in Australia, to flourish she had to venture overseas, like many aspiring Australian models do.

'Miranda's connection to Australia is incredibly important to her and the documentary is not representative of her life.

'She does a remarkable job balancing an incredibly successful career with being a loving and dedicated mother.'

Reflecting? Miranda posted this old shot of herself and her mother and grandmother on her Instagram page in December. The model has made no public remarks about her deteriorating relationship with either

The documentary touched on a possible explanation behind a family rift that has rent her once-close-knit family.

In 2012, Miranda took over control of the Kora Organics skincare line, created by her but managed by mother Therese.

Miranda made clear to all - including her family and those involved in her modelling career - that now that she was 30, she would be taking greater control of her life.

Separated: The Kerr family say they haven't seen Miranda or her son Flynn for over a year 

John spoke of his wife's determination and ambition, saying that 'she can get very blinkered' when going for something she wanted.

Miranda's younger brother Matthew added that mother and daughter were the same in that they both 'like to be in control... they're leaders'.

Since parting ways with Kora Organics, Therese has created her own called Divine by Therese Kerr, and says that while she realises her daughter's fame has helped get the 'message out', it has perhaps come at a cost to her family.

Breaking the news: John, pictured here with his daughter and Orlando in August 2012, says it was the actor who confirmed to him the news of the couple's separation last year, over the telephone

'You have to be in the media to be able 
to get your message out, but then our little Flynny doesn't know what 
it's like to walk outside without paparazzi,' she said.

Therese, who said she used to speak to her daughter every single day, was teary as she explained  how she had to eventually 'let go' of Miranda.

She said: 'What I have had to do is let go, and allow her to be assertive and lead her own life and I guess for any mum that's a little bit challenging sometimes to do that.'

Missing his grandson: John says he hopes that Flynn grows up and wants to be with his 'nan and pop'

Therese said she now sent texts to 
Miranda to remind her that she was always there for her, but as she was 
filmed doing so during the documentary, they were not always immediately 
reciprocated.

She said: 'We have been best friends for most of our life. We used to talk just about every day.

'I send her messages, just little texts to say "I love you honey, let your little light shine, my arms are wrapped around you".'

Sexy selfie: Miranda posted this racy selfie on Thursday during what appeared to be a modelling shot

Before Miranda moved to New York at the 
age of 25, her parents say they told the then budding supermodel 'the 
day you think you're better than anyone else is the day you don't model 
under our guidance'.

Therese said these days her daughter's life was completely different, but it was important to stand 'true'.

She said: 'Miranda's life is so different now [and] she's surrounded by yes people all the time. It's so important for me to be real, to be true, to be who she needs me to be.'
