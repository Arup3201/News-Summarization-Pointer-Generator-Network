Despicable, Gary Neville called it. Jamie Carragher said it was 'selfish'; Roberto Martinez's description of choice, meanwhile, was 'unfortunate'.

Whatever adjective you wanted to go for, there was no disputing the impact of Kevin Mirallas' actions in the 43rd minute of this unremarkable Barclays Premier League encounter. Putting himself ahead of his team, he has cranked up the tension and pressure on Everton's floundering campaign.

Everton versus West Bromwich Albion was never a fixture that looked like entering the vaults of football gold but it ended up producing one of the season's most controversial moments. Martinez may have tried to defuse it but do not underestimate the ramifications.

It all started when Seamus Coleman hoisted in a cross. Romelu Lukaku chested the ball down and, as it bounced up, Joleon Lescott handled. Referee Michael Oliver had no hesitation pointing to the penalty spot, waving away the token West Brom appeals.

Usually in such circumstances, Leighton Baines steps up, picks his spot then smashes his drive unerringly into the net. This time, however, Mirallas was set on the glory, ignoring Lukaku's attempts to take the ball off him and give it to the England international.

Steven Naismith also stepped in, imploring Mirallas to 'give it to Bainesy'. He didn't. Baines had the final say, repeatedly asking Mirallas whether he was sure he wanted to take it. So he did. And he missed. And the growls and groans began sweeping around Goodison Park. This was farce.

'If Leighton Baines wants to take the penalty, he takes the penalty,' Martinez argued after a 0-0 draw that stretches his team's wretched run to one win in 13 games in all competitions. 'We are making an issue about a penalty taker who misses the penalty.

'It makes it a big issue but if he hits the back of the net, nothing would happen. We are a team that is very much together. If we had played this game 10 times, we would have had nine wins. The disappointment is that we can't finish the penalty. Of course I am disappointed.'

So much for the Hollywood ending: they were filming for Sylvester Stallone's latest blockbuster at Goodison Park on Monday night but, instead, they had to sit through a raspberry; not even a message from Stallone, broadcast on the big screens, could lift the mood.

Cameras were on the pitch at half-time to shoot some crowd scenes for his latest Rocky-based project, 'Creed', but try as they did to rouse themselves, the home supporters were baffled by what had gone on. They knew chances were going to be scarce, that failures would be costly.

Though Martinez has experienced relegation with Wigan Athletic, it is possible to argue the last two months have been the most testing of his managerial career as Everton have plummeted from being Champions League dark horses to the fringes of the relegation skirmish.

Looking at the squad they have – a number of promising young internationals allied with experienced old campaigners – Everton should not be rubbing shoulders with those clubs fighting to stay above water but that is what happens when clubs endure a run of one win in 12 games.

Everton's troubles have clearly been weighing on Martinez's shoulders, as he has looked drawn and tired in recent weeks, in desperate need of a tonic. Or – more accurately – in desperate need of three points. That gives you an idea of what was riding on this encounter.

And that puts Mirallas' miss into sharper perspective. He swept his right-footed wide of the post and even if it had been on target, Foster had dived the right way and would have got there. As the ball cannoned into the advertising hoardings, groans swept the stadium and Martinez looked bewildered.

Baines' record is 15 successful kicks from 16 and missing at Old Trafford in October clearly had no lasting impact, as the following month he successfully converted against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. In a game where there was no margin for error, this was a huge mistake.

That proved to be Mirallas' last contribution, as he never resurfaced after the break, his place being taken by Bryan Oviedo; Martinez had been answering questions about Mirallas' future before this game, in relation to a new contract, but this hardly did the Belgian any good.

'At that moment he felt confident and he wanted to take it,' said Martinez, who revealed Mirallas' substitution was down to him suffering a hamstring problem. 'Leighton Baines is the No 1 penalty taker, but at that point I would have been happy to allow him and Kevin to discuss that.

'The issue is we have not scored the penalty and we have not scored. Kevin Mirallas scored the first penalty at West Ham in the penalty shootout. He was not 100 per cent, he was feeling his hamstring and straight after the penalty. We needed a dynamic player in the second half.'

Trouble was, there was no dynamism. West Brom, for whom Claudio Yacob, Gareth McAuley and Ben Foster were superb, stood firm and deserved their point. They headed home with their spirits lifted. Martinez, by contrast, left with his anxieties increasing.
