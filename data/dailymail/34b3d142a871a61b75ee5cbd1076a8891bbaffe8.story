Fifty years after the assassination of President John F Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, researchers are still investigating his mysterious murder.

Thousands of pages pertaining to the assassination are still sealed, and researchers are calling for a complete public release.

Jefferson Morley, former Washington Post Reporter currently suing the CIA to release the data, is most interested in a file containing about 300 pages on the now-deceased CIA agent George Joannides.

Call for transparency: Even fifty years after JFK's assassination, thousands of documents relating to the killing remained sealed

Joannides, Morley believes, may have 
had contact with suspected assassin Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the 
shooting and later served as Langley's liaison for a JFK assassination 
investigation in the 1970s.

Who is George Joannides? Researchers believe that files on the CIA agent may reveal the suspected JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald had a connection at Langley

The
 first official investigation found that Lee Harvey Oswald was acting 
alone, after failing to get a visa to Cuba and his wife Marina rejected 
his attempts at reconciliation.

Another
 investigation in the mid-1970s said that the assassination was probably
 a conspiracy, after discovering audio files suggesting a second 
shooter.

These 
contradicting opinions have led many to come up with conspiracy theories
 behind the president's death replacing the initial conclusion that Oswald 
acted alone.

Morley doesn't
 believe that the documents will reveal any big conspiracy, but it may 
prove that the CIA did know of Oswald before the shooting.

That
 would contradict the first investigation's findings that Kennedy's 
assassination was carried out by a lone-ranger, a completely random act 
that couldn't have been prevented. 

Morley
 believes that Oswald may have been in contact with Joannides due to his
 noted involvement in an pro-Castro organization.

Oswald's membership in
 the Fair Play for Cuba Committee was confirmed when he was captured by a
 local television station in an altercation with anti-Castro 
demonstrators.

But
 investigators later found that Oswald had pamphlets in his possession 
with an address of a local anti-Castro operation connected to a former 
FBI agent.

Researchers believe those pamphlets mean that Oswald was working with counterintelligence to discredit his pro-Castro group.

If
 that's the case he would have been in contact with George Joannides the
 CIA case officer for the anti-Castro Student Revolutionary Directorate -
 the same group Oswald got in a brawl with.

If Oswald was in contact with Joannides, it means that the CIA concealed the fact that Oswald was on their radar.

But Joannides connection to the assassination doesn't end there.

A
 second investigation into the assassination convened in the mid-1970s 
and this time weighing audio evidence of a possible second shooter.

In
 the end the committee reported that the president was 'probably 
assassinated as the result of a conspiracy. The committee is unable to 
identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy.'

The
 committee sifted through thousands of CIA records, and their liaison to
 Langley at the time was none other than George Joannides,

G
 Robert Blakey, the committee's chief counsel, recalled how the CIA 
brought in Joannides to act as a middleman to help fill requests for 
documents made by committee researchers.

'He was put in a position to edit everything we were given before it was given to us,' Blakey said.

But Blakey didn't learn about Joannides' past until Morley unearthed it in files declassified years later.

'If
 I'd known Joannides was the case officer for the DRE, he couldn't have 
been liaison; he would have been a witness,' Blakey told The Associated 
Press.

Morley
 does not suggest the Joannides files point to agency involvement in the
 assassination itself, but more likely that their release would show the
 CIA trying to keep secret its own flawed performance before the 
assassination.

'The
 idea that Lee Harvey Oswald was some unknown quantity to CIA officers 
was false,' Morley said. 'There was this incredible high-level attention
 to Oswald on the eve of the assassination.'

Assuming that Oswald fired the fatal shot, he said, 'These top CIA case officers are guilty of negligence.'

Blakey
 isn't optimistic about getting all of the documents from the 
intelligence agency, citing the agencies lack of cooperation with three 
previous investigations.

'That's
 three agencies that they were supposed to be fully candid with,' he 
said. 'And now they're taking the position that some of these documents 
can't be released even today.'

'Why are they continuing to fight tooth and nail to avoid doing something they'd promised to do?'

According
 to the President John F Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act 
of 1992, all documents pertaining to the assassination must be released 
by 2017.

The act does 
offer a little wiggle room to agencies who can petition records withheld
 if disclosure would compromise 'military, defense, intelligence 
operations, law enforcement or conduct of foreign relations'.
