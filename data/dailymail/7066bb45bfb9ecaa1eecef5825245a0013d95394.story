The Great British Bake Off is to be moved to BBC1 next year as a result of its rising ratings.

The contest, the final of which is next week, has had BBC2's highest viewing figures so far this year with an average audience of seven million.

BBC1 controller Charlotte Moore announced the move of channels today and it will begin for the fifth batch of shows.

She said: 'It's been fantastic to watch it flourish on BBC2 and I can assure viewers I will continue to cherish it on BBC1.'

The audience has grown from an average of 2.8 million for the first series in 2010, peaking with 7.8 million a fortnight ago - more than even last year's final, which drew a total of 7.2 million.

The show - featuring experts Mary Berry 
and Paul Hollywood - has been credited with giving the nation a 
new-found interest in baking, and the format of the show has been sold 
to more than a dozen countries.

Moore, who originally commissioned the show when she was in another role in 2009, said she thought the time was right to bring the show to 'an even broader audience'.

'I've watched the series grow over the last few years and earn a special place in the nation's hearts. It's inspiring and warm storytelling at its best which celebrates the huge talent of enthusiastic and passionate bakers from all over the country,' she said.

Executive producer of the show Anna Beattie, who is chief executive of Love Productions which makes it, said: 'We're extremely proud that the show has captivated so many families and inspired so many people across the country and we aim to do everything we can to ensure its continuing authenticity and integrity.'Â
