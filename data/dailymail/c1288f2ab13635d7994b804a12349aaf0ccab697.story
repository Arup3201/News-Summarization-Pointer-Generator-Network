Tory plans to force all visitors to the UK to pay a £3,000 bond will be blocked by the Lib Dems, Nick Clegg vowed today.

The Deputy Prime Minister vowed to jettison Theresa May’s push to ‘clobber’ tens of thousands of visitors from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria before they are allowed to enter Britain.

And in further signs of a coalition rift over immigration, Mr Clegg dismissed the ‘silly’ ad vans warning illegal immigrants in London to ‘go home’ and insisted they would not be rolled out across nationwide.

Division: Nick Clegg sought to distance himself from his Tory coalition partners, attacking Home Office plans for a £3,000 bond for all visitors to the UK

Mr Clegg has ordered his party to use their annual conference in Glasgow to launch a series of attacks on their Conservative coalition partners.

After attacking a Tory idea to allow firms to fire staff at will, he today claimed the Tories would not ensure the economic recovery was ‘fair’ if left to run the country alone. Other rifts also emerged over wind power and welfare cuts.

It comes as a poll shows Lib Dem party members want to forge a power-sharing deal with Labour next time round.

Mr Clegg denied holding secret talks with either party ahead of the 2015 election. 

Controversy: Investigation: The Home Office's 'Go Home' vans were 'silly' and should not be used nationwide, Mr Clegg said

Nick Clegg tried to play down suggestions that he favoured a new coalition with the Tories - but then saved his biggest economic criticism for Labour.

The Lib Dem leader is under pressure from party members to forge a power-sharing deal with Labour after the next election.

The Independent on Sunday published a poll conducted by the website Liberal Democrat Voice, which found that 39 per cent of activists questioned would prefer a Lib Dem-Labour coalition after 2015, compared with just 15 per cent who favour another coalition with the Conservatives.

But challenged over the role the Lib Dems would play working with either party, Mr Clegg claimed Labour left to run the country alone would 'wreck' the economy.

But he suggested only that the Tories would not be fair.

He told BBC's Andrew Marr programme: 'It is my genuine belief that if you go  back to the bad old days, not of coalition and balanced politics, but either the left or the right dominating government on their own, you will get a recovery that is neither fair nor sustainable.

'I think Labour would wreck the recovery, and under the Conservatives, who don’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do, you’d get the wrong kind of recovery.

'So our message is: coalition is good; what the Liberal Democrats have done in government is good. Let us finish the job, but let us finish it fairly.'

But he turned his fire on the Conservatives, vowing to use his power to block tough immigration policies.

Home
Secretary Mrs May says she wants to make the immigration system more 
‘selective’ and deter people from ‘overstaying’ once their visitor visa 
has expired.

In the long-term, she hopes to extend an Australian-style £3,000 bond scheme to also include foreign workers and students but they have become bogged down in coalition wrangling.

Asked if he would block the idea, Mr Clegg told BBC1’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘Of course, of course. In a coalition I can stop things.

‘I am absolutely not interested in a bond which becomes an indiscriminate way of clobbering people who want to come to this country and in many respects bring great prosperity and benefits to this country. Of course not.

‘But on immigration let me be clear. Clearly to create a tolerant society people need to have confidence in the way in which the immigration system is run.

‘That’s why I have been outspoken in my view, not just in this coalition government but before we were elected that we have introduce exit checks for instance.

‘But we must at the same time say that an open economy such as ours open to the world has to be welcoming to those who want to come here.

‘They are certainty not going to go ahead on the basis of an indiscriminate bond being applied to all visitors to this country.’

The Lib Dem leader said he was willing to support a targeted bond ‘as an extra discretionary tool for customs officers so where they have doubts  about whether people are going to return  to their home country’.

He added: ‘I think one way or another we need to give the public the confidence that if you give someone a visa and say you can be here for five years, two years, three years that is what it means.

‘Otherwise what’s the point of issuing those kind of visas?’

The Home Office has also sent vans displaying billboards warning overstaying migrants ‘Go home, or you'll be picked up and deported’ to tour six London boroughs in July.

Tory ministers have made clear their desire to send the vans across the country.

But Mr Clegg insisted he would also block that a nationwide campaign: ‘I thought they were a very silly idea, and I said so at the time.

‘I don’t think you inspire public confidence by aimlessly drifting around in vans in North London saying by the way can you go home please.’

The splits on immigration come after the Deputy Prime Minister last night denounced 'bizarre' Tory ideas about employment rights and said only the Lib Dems could speak credibly about creating and defending jobs.

Mr Clegg pleaded with his party to unite behind him, as Lembit Opik made fresh calls for the Lib Dem leader to quit.

Clash: Ex-Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said it was 'nothing personal' but Nick Clegg has to quit as Lib Dem leader 

Writing for MailOnline, ex-MP Mr Opik warned that without a new leader the Lib Dems faced ‘destruction’.

In
a damning assessment of the Deputy Prime Minister’s performance, Mr 
Opik claims that if the party were a business ‘he’d have been fired a 
long ago’.

The searing criticism from one of the Lib
Dems’ best known figures comes after peer Lord Oakeshott warned the Lib
Dems could be reduced to just 20 seats at the next election and called 
for Mr Clegg to quit.

With the party stubbornly stuck at around
10 per cent in the polls, behind UKIP, there are fears many MPs will be
lost at the 2015 election.

Mr Opik, who has called for a new 
leader before, warns the party will be lucky to retain half of its 57 
seats with Mr Clegg in charge.

He writes: ‘I’ve got nothing against Nick Clegg personally.  It’s purely business. 

‘And the truth is, if the Liberal Democrats were a business, he’d have been fired a long ago. 

‘No
‘Chief Executive Officer’ could survive such terrible performance 
indicators: a catastrophic decline in membership, a virtual halving of 
local Councillors, a dreadful deposit-losing London mayoral result and 
the worst poll ratings in over two decades.’

Damning: Vicky Pryce says it is a 'myth' that taxing high value property could be a source of income for the Government

Nick Clegg stepped up calls for higher taxes on the wealthy, as he signalled soaking the rich will be a key demand of the Lib Dems at the next election.

He said the party's commitment to a mansion tax on properties over £2
million, raising £2 billion, sent a signal that 'even though we are 
committed to deficit reduction' that would not be achieved entirely 
through spending cuts.

He told the BBC: 'Taxes and particularly taxes on people 
who can afford it, have to play some role in the ongoing effort to 
making sure that we complete the job of filling the black hole in the 
public finances.

'If the Conservatives don't want to do 
that then they need to tell people, and that's part of the debate we 
will have to have over the next year-and-a-half, what they will cut - 
schools or hospitals or pensions or police or the armed services - to 
make up that £2 billion.'

However Mr Clegg's plans for a ‘mansion tax’ have been savaged by Vicky Pryce – former wife of disgraced Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne.

Ms Pryce says it is a ‘myth’ that taxing homes worth more than £2 million will be a ‘magic source of income’ for the Government.

Ms Pryce, who will attend the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, dismisses the whole idea of a 
mansion tax, which has been blocked by the Conservatives.

In
an article for today’s Mail on Sunday, she says: ‘It is a tax that is 
set at an arbitrary level with no  economic justification for that level
or the rate imposed – except to raise a certain amount of money’ and ‘a
mantra for those who feel there is a hidden reservoir of taxes just 
waiting to be tapped’.

Ms 
Pryce also pointedly disagrees with her friend Vince Cable, the Business
Secretary, who has raised fears that Coalition plans for low-deposit 
mortgages could lead to a new house price bubble.

‘There are concerns over a housing market bubble – expressed by Vince Cable no less – but I don’t share them,’ she says.
