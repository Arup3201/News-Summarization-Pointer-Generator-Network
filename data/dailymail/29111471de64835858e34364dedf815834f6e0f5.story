Nine days on from his Open Championship success and Rory McIlroy says he has already moved on.

‘Rather than reflect on it and enjoy it, I want to use it as a springboard,’ he said. ‘Yes, it’s going to be great to be introduced as the Open champion but that’s not all I want to be this year. I’ve got a lot more things I want to achieve.’

Two more goals will move instantly into view when the driven Northern Irishman plays in his first tournament since his stirring victory at Hoylake at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, which begins at Firestone on Thursday.

‘I’ve won three majors but never a World Golf Championship event, so that’s a goal,’ he said. ‘I can also become world No 1 again if I win, and that’s definitely on my list.’

Naturally, it’s not all work. There’s still been time for back-slapping and story swapping with his peers on the practice ground.

‘Keegan Bradley was telling me when he won the USPGA he took the Wanamaker Trophy to this bar and became a bit nervous when everyone started drinking out of it,’ said McIlroy. ‘I couldn’t have done that. I took the Claret Jug to this bar in Belfast on the Monday with my mates and I must admit I did find myself watching where it was going. I didn’t want it going beyond the people I trust.’

McIlroy spent the rest of the week working on his fitness in London and fulfilling some sponsorship obligations before returning with the jug to his home in Florida last Friday.

‘I’ve taken a photo of it on top of the television, on top of the toilet, silly things like that and sending the pictures to my friends,’ he said, smiling. ‘It’s just nice to have it in my possession.’

After winning his first major, the US Open, in 2011 McIlroy admitted he could happily have taken the rest of the year off. ‘It was such a relief after what had happened at the Masters (he lost a four-shot lead heading into the final round),’ he said.

‘Winning the USPGA the following year definitely felt different. The London Olympics were on, there were a lot of great sports stories around, and I felt like I do now, that I wanted to get out there and win some more.

‘Going home after winning The Open, though, I certainly feel like my fame has gone up a notch. We’ve got social media now and so your whole life is out there. But it won’t deflect me from my main objectives.’

Asked if it was possible to live a normal life and still be so intent on winning majors, McIlroy responded: ‘I never grew up wanting to live a normal life. I wanted to win majors. But I still think you can sort of do both. I can still do relatively normal things, and it’s not going to be difficult for me to stay hungry.’

Only once in his life did McIlroy lose his appetite for the game. He explained, laughing: ‘I was 16, I’d just won the Mullingar Scratch Cup and I was driving home with my dad and said to him: “I don’t think I like this anymore.”

‘Three days later, I said to him: “I like it again now.” I guess I was just a grumpy teenager going through some hormonal issues.’

Advisory role: McIlroy thinks Bernhard Langer should stay as Europe's assistant captain for the Ryder Cup

McIlroy was asked about the possibility of Bernhard Langer playing in September’s Ryder Cup at the age of 57 and, typically, didn’t duck the question. ‘I think the dynamic in the team room is just great right now,’ he said. ‘He’d be a great assistant captain but I don’t think he should play.’

It’s a curious thing that McIlroy’s two victories this year have come at Wentworth, a venue he doesn’t like, and at a links that is not supposed to suit his game.

Now he’s at Firestone, where he has had three top-five finishes in five starts, followed by the season’s final major, the USPGA at the similarly constructed Valhalla.

‘They’re definitely two courses that should suit me and I’ve got a lot of faith in my game, so let’s see what happens,’ he said. ‘Let’s see if I can ride this momentum.’
