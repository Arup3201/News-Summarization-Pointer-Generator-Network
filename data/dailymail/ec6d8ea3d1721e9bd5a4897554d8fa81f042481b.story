Eight million people have signed up for health care through new government controlled insurance exchanges, President Barack Obama announced Thursday.

Obama held a last-minute press conference in the White House briefing room to celebrate the new Obamacare figures, which beat initial projections by 1 million people.

'This thing is working,' Obama said of the Affordable Care Act.

President Barack Obama announced Thursday that eight million people signed up for health insurance under the country's government-run healthcare insurances. Under the new law, Americans who do not receive health insurance through their employer are required to purchase it out-of-pocket

Obama and Democrats have been anxiously awaiting the age figures, especially those regarding young people — the most coveted demographic. Younger enrollees tend to be a healthier group overall, so their premiums can help offset higher cost of care for older enrollees. Too few young people in the mix, and healthcare premiums could surge. Obama announced Thursday that about 35 percent of those who signed up for the exchanges are under the age of 35.

The new figures gave the President an opportunity to rag on Republicans, some of whom have accused the White House of 'cooking the books' by announcing large overall enrollment numbers before releasing more detailed figures that provide a fuller picture.

'They still can't bring themselves to admit that the Affordable Care Act is working,' Obama said during Thursday's presser before attacking Republicans' 'endless, fruitless repeal efforts' and claiming that the Obamacare 'repeal debate is, and should be over.'

'It’s long past time for Washington Democrats to work with us to remedy the mess they created—and that means repealing this law and replacing it with real reforms that actually lower costs,' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, fired back after Obama's speech.

'The President may want to silence any further debate about Obamacare, but in doing so he betrays a lack of confidence in his own policies and scant regard for those most affected by the law.'

The President spent nearly as much time 
during his remarks criticizing Republicans' opposition to his signature 
law as he did touting its success, meanwhile arguing that Republicans' 
time would be better spent passing legislation that would positively 
affect Americans' lives.

Polling shows the law remains 
unpopular in much of the country, but Democrats plan to use the high 
enrollment figures to argue that by trying to repeal the law, 
Republicans are actively working to take health care away from millions 
of Americans who now rely on the exchanges.

Other critical details for evaluating 
how well the law is working remain unknown. Officials haven't released a
 tally of how many enrollees were previously uninsured — the key to 
determining how many people gained coverage that they otherwise wouldn't
 have. Another unknown is how many enrollees sealed the deal by paying 
their first month's premium to the insurance companies.

Gallup
 estimates that slightly more than half of those getting coverage 
through the federal and state markets were previously uninsured, drawing
 that conclusion from the polling company's large survey tracking the 
health care overhaul.

In a statement sent to reporters after Obama's remarks, Speaker of the House John Boehner's office once again accused the White House continuing 'to obscure the full impact of Obamacare.'

'Beyond refusing to disclose the number of people who’ve actually enrolled by paying premiums, the president ignores the havoc that this law has wreaked on private plans that people already had and liked. Surveys have consistently shown that the overwhelming majority of those who signed up already had insurance,' Boehner's press secretary Brendan Buck said in an email.

'Had this law not led to millions of Americans receiving cancelation notices, many would not have had to sign up for this government-run program.'

Seven months out from Election Day, Democrats are seeking to turn the page on the law's flawed debut ¿ a strategy underscored Sebelius' departure

Following the disastrous rollout of the 
exchanges in October, when HealthCare.gov was virtually unusable, 
Democrats have been hoping that higher-than-expected results could help 
their candidates reclaim the political high ground ahead of the midterm 
elections.

Seven months out from Election Day, Democrats are seeking to turn the page on the law's flawed debut — a strategy underscored last week when Obama announced that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who became the face of the rollout failure, was stepping down.

Today's press conference reiterated the White House's hopes that the country would 'move on' from the Obamacare debate before November, even if the Republican Party does not.
