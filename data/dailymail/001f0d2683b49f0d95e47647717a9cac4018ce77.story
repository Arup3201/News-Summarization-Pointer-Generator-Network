It's not exactly a competition for the faint-hearted, but let's hope there was no sting in the tale for any of these brave bee beard growers.

The remarkably daring men and women have got Ontario all abuzz after taking part in the tenth annual Clovermead Bee Beard Competition.

The contest sees four teams of competitors entice swarms of bees to the head and torso of a 'beard grower' before two winners are chosen by the audience and the official judges.

Each team consists not only of the beard model, but also a 'bee whisperer', who is able to groom the flying insects into the required shape. 

Beebearding is thought to date back to the 1700s when an English beekeeper discovered he could create a beard of bees by tying the queen to a thread around his neck and would parade through the streets wearing the unusual costume.

At the Clovermead competition however, once in place, the beards are weighed before each wearer goes on to strut their stuff and perform a little dance in front of the watching crowds.

The Bee Beard Champion is then chosen by judges, while the audience is also able to pick their Crowd Favourite.

Clovermead Apiaries co-owner Chris Hiemstra told the In Transit blog of The New York Times: 'Bee beards are wonderful, but they’re really tickly.

'It takes well over a thousand stings in one shot to kill a person, so if you get a sting or two it’s no big deal.'

The competition at Clovermead sees $2,500 donated to the champion's charity of choice, while $2,000 is given to the Crowd Favourite's charity and $500 is offered to charities chosen by the remaining two competitors.
