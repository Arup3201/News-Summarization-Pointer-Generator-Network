Foam: A new acne drug trial produced no side effects, unlike those on the market (posed by model)

A foam that’s squirted on to the skin could be a radical new treatment for acne. It contains small amounts of a drug called minocycline, an antibiotic that’s long been used to treat the condition.

The treatment works by destroying the bacteria that lead to acne breakouts. Although minocycline is effective when taken as a tablet, it can have nasty side-effects such as vertigo, dizziness, diarrhoea and mouth ulcers.

However, it’s hoped the new foam, which is gently rubbed on to spots and is absorbed within seconds, will slash the risk of adverse effects because the drug does not have to pass through the body before it reaches its target.

Early trials show the experimental foam, called FMX101, is as effective as the drug in pill form, with a once-daily application reducing the number of spots by around 72 per cent over a three-month period.

Crucially, none of the 150 patients who took part in the trial reported major side-effects.

Acne affects eight out of ten teenagers and more than half of women over 25. Hormonal changes cause the sebaceous glands in the skin to produce increased amounts of an oily substance called sebum.

Together with dead skin cells, the sebum blocks hair follicles, trapping bacteria that usually live harmlessly on the skin, where they actually help to protect against infection by a wide range of organisms.

The main bacterium involved is Propionibacterium acnes, or P. acnes, and, like others found on the skin, it needs a constant supply of oxygen to flourish.

But trapped inside the skin, rather than living harmlessly on the surface, it is starved of its normal supply and starts to attack healthy skin cells in an attempt to access the oxygen that is circulating in the blood.

Meanwhile, the immune system, sensing the body is under attack, sends out white blood cells to try to ward off the bacteria. The result is the inflammation and swelling that leads to an angry-looking spot that can become itchy and sore before eventually erupting and, in some cases, scarring the skin.

Treatment ranges from creams and gels for mild acne with no underlying inflammation, to powerful antibiotics — such as minocycline — to kill bacteria in the skin.

Israeli firm Foamix Inc developed the foam as an alternative to tablets. Unlike gels, ointments or creams, it disappears rapidly and leaves less of a sticky residue on the skin.

The foam is due to enter the final stages of clinical trials next year and could be available within two to three years.

Dr Tony Chu, consultant dermatologist at Hammersmith Hospital in London, says using foam to deliver drugs to affected areas of the skin was potentially a good idea.

But he warns: ‘Minocycline can cause unsightly pigmentation in scarred areas of the skin — even when taken as a tablet.

‘Another issue is the development of antibiotic drug resistance, which is increased if antibiotics are used on the skin.'
