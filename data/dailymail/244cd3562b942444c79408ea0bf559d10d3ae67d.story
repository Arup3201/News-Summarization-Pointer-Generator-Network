The father of the woman at the centre of the Mitchell Pearce nightclub saga has declared 'I've shot a lot of pigs,' when asked what he would do if he crossed the Roosters star.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, painter Antonio Arroja revealed he first found out his daughter, Melissa Arroja, had sparked a high profile police investigation when he saw her on the news on Tuesday night.

'He's done the wrong thing,' Mr Arroja said. 'But he's a footballer, it doesn't matter what happens, she's not going to win. She may as well... let him play State Of Origin.'

Although the internal investigation conducted by NSW Police has not led to further legal action due to Ms Arroja choosing not to make a formal statement to detectives, the Sydney Roosters handed out their own penalties to Pearce on Tuesday.

The footballer has been stood down from a single match and fined $20,000 which will be donated to charity. He's also expected to complete a counseling program. However he will be free to play in the May 28 Origin opener.

Mr Arroja, a Canterbury Bulldogs supporter, also slammed staff at the Beach Haus nightclub for letting Mitchell Pearce enter the establishment after he was removed from another hotel earlier in the evening.

'Why was he allowed to go into a club if he was already kicked out for being drunk,' he said.

'He'd been drinking at the Clovelly and got kicked out.'

Mr Arroja said he was dubious that Pearce would be adequately punished for lunging at his daughter Melissa Arroja (pictured), shortly before it was revealed the footballer had been fined $20,000

He said he was proud of his daughter, 30, who he said frequented Kings Cross with her friends.

Asked for his views on the now-infamous yellow dress which inspired a social media storm, Mr Arroja said: 'As far as I'm concerned it's a normal dress...she bought it from a shop.'

The father-of-four said he was bombarded with phone calls and emails from family after bulletins revealed the identity of his daughter.

MailOnline also asked for his opinion on Melissa Arroja's online 'Melzbubblebutt' alias.

'You'll have to talk to her,' he said.

He also said he 'already hated the Roosters' prior to the booze-fueled incident early on Sunday morning.

CCTV footage filmed by 16 cameras and obtained by Channel 9 showed Pearce twice 'lunging' at Ms Arroja after grabbing at her as she passed by.

The footage then shows the woman wearing a yellow dress alerting uniformed police in the club to his advances.

Ms Arroja decided not to make a formal statement to police about the incident, which took place at Beach Haus on Saturday night

He was arrested, led away in handcuffs and later issued with a $500 fine for failing to leave a licensed premises.

Police announced on Tuesday morning they had wrapped up their inquiries after Ms Arroja declined to press charges.

Summing up the Kings Cross incident, Mr Arroja said 'She's not a child. She's done nothing wrong...if she was in trouble with police then I'd be worried.

'I think (Pearce) learned a good lesson, and if not somebody's going to teach him.'

Ms Arroja, of Portugese decent, removed her social media accounts from the internet on Tuesday afternoon after media outlets reported her name.

She earlier boasted to followers that her slitted Fluro dress attracted footballers, writing on an Instagram picture of herself: 'That dress is shooo hot but attracts nothing but drama… And footy players farkkk,' according to the Daily Telegraph.

Mr Arrujo denied claims his daughter knew the Roosters squad.

In a video statement released by the Roosters on Wednesday, Pearce apologised to his family before the club announced he had voluntarily quit drinking for the remainder of the season.

'Firstly I want to say sorry for my parents, who are my biggest supporters,' Pearce said.

'I let them down, embarrassed them and they've had to wear the brunt the last couple of days, which has been hard for them.'

'Also my girlfriend, who is obviously my biggest supporter and has copped this the hardest. 

'It's unfair on her, and hopefully we can work through things.

The Roosters were engaging in an 'information gathering exercise' following the incident, though Pearce was back at training this morning

'Pearce's team mate, Boyd Cordner, who accompanied him on the night of the drama, has also been punished by the Sydney Roosters who slammed a $5000 fine on the footballer.

Sydney Roosters Chief Operating Officer Football, Brian Canavan said: 'The club is most disappointed with the events of the weekend.

'The club and NRL have strong policies in place and there is a process that has had to run its course.

'Mitchell and Boyd have accepted the club sanctions and shown genuine remorse for the negative spotlight both have attracted to the Roosters and the game by breaching the club’s and NRL’s standards.'

This is despite Pearce issuing a statement on Monday to Channel Nine News through his lawyer, denying that anything untoward took place between him and Ms Arroja.

'There has been speculation and innuendo in the media which creates the impression that our client had an inappropriate interaction with a female patron at a nightclub over the weekend. That speculation is false,' said the statement.
