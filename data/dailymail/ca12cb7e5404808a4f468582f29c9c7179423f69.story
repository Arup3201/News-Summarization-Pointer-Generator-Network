After accusations of ludicrous storylines and legal blunders Broadchurch viewers have accused scriptwriters of their most unrealistic twist yet - table service from Nando's.

Disgruntled fans have complained after David Tennant's character DI Alec Hardy  was seen in the latest episode of ITV's crime show, set in Dorset,  ordering chicken from a waiter who appeared beside his table.

At the Portuguese fast food chain, customers order their food at the till and pay at the same time.

Disgruntled viewers have complained that the latest episode of ITV's crime show Broadchurch is unrealistic as it shows table service in fast food restaurant Nando's

Fans have taken to Twitter to complain that the scene with DI Alec Hardy (played by David Tennant) and his family in Nando's was not true to life because a waiter came to take their chicken order

At the Portuguese chicken restaurant customers order their food at the till and pay at the same time. Over the last few weeks the second series of the show has come under fire for its inaccuracies and unrealistic scenes

Over the last few weeks the second series of the show has come under fire for its inaccuracies and unrealistic scenes.

The first episode frustrated viewers with its ‘mumbling’ dialogue and the second was littered with legal blunders.

Episode three included unrealistic scenes in which a mother appeared in court shortly after giving birth – and her baby appeared to be much older than a newborn. 

And many turned to Twitter to condemn the show when high-flying black lawyer Sharon Bishop, played by Oscar-nominated Marianne Jean-Baptiste, was portrayed as a single mother.

Her son is the only black male character in the show. He is in prison and there is no sign of a father figure in his life. 

Elsewhere mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, prompted ridicule when she returned to court to witness the trial of Joe Miller a short time after an easy water birth.

But last night fans complained on Twitter that the latest scene with DI Hardy and his family in the fast-food chain Nando's was the most unrealistic to date. 

'I can see why everyone complains about #Broadchurch being unrealistic now - table service at Nandos? Whatever next!' said viewer Kate.

Viewers have also pointed out Beth's baby, Lizzie,  looked much too big to be a newborn and could even hold her head up at just 24 hours old

Another fan, Joanne Louise, tweeted: 'Urmmm since when do Nandos do table service? Hahaha.'

Paul Phipps-Williams added: 'Is the most unrealistic thing in #Broadchurch table service at Nandos?'

Whilst Cian Ginty tweeted: 'Broadchurch even got the ordering in Nandos wrong!'

Nando's, which specialises in chicken dishes and is famous for its peri-peri sauce, opened its first UK restaurant in 1992.

The first series of Broadchurch premiered in March 2013 and was nominated for seven BAFTA awards.

It focused on the death of an 11-year-old boy and the impact of grief and media attention on the town. Most of the cast has returned for the second series.

Viewers have previously that during the second series they have had to use subtitles as lead actor David Tenant 'mumbles' and speaks in a strong Scottish accent.

Digging up Danny's corpse. 

What happened: Danny Latimer’s parents Beth and Mark with prosecuting barrister Jocelyn Knight were horrified after Joe Miller’s defence team got Danny’s body exhumed on the flimsiest of grounds and without the prior approval of his family. 

But retired detective Graham Walker told the Mail on Sunday: ‘The body belongs to the coroner and in these circumstances no coroner would allow an exhumation. You would have to consult the family beforehand. The only reason not to is if the entire family were suspects in the case.’

Use of spy cameras 

What happened: Hardy installs a number of hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of DS Miller - where a terrified Claire is finally persuaded to meet her former husband - in the hope of getting a confession from Lee. 

Hardy installs hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of DS Miller, but any confession obtained through these would be inadmissible in court

But Graham Walker explains: ‘I’m afraid that any confession that is obtained through these means would be totally inadmissible in court. Of course, if you suspect somebody of an offence, you must caution them and tell them they have a right to remain silent.’

The wrong wig 

What happened: Sonia Sharma (Meera Syal) is the judge in the case of Joe Miller but the wig she wears is quite different from the short bench wig worn by a judge presiding over a trial in a criminal case.

Why Beth would never have been interrogated about her sex life

What happened: The judge allows the defence barrister to question Danny’s mother about her sex life and the affair her husband Mark had with a woman called Becca Fisher, even though it has no obvious connection to the murder. But criminal barrister Maria Dineen explains: ‘The sort of questions that were being asked would not have been allowed. There is no relevance whatsoever.'

Could Beth and Mark really select their own criminal barrister? 

What happened: Danny’s grieving parents choose retired local lawyer Jocelyn Knight as their prosecution barrister. 

But legal expert Baroness Kennedy says: ‘The whole thing about prosecutions is that they are brought by the state in the name of Queen.

Danny’s grieving parents would never have been able to choose their own prosecution barrister in real life

‘They are brought on behalf of society at large and the victim’s family does not get to choose the barrister.’ 

Witnesses can't stay to watch trial

What happened: Danny’s parents Beth and Mark, along with the local vicar are among the witnesses for both the prosecution and defence who are all allowed to sit in court and listen to each other as they give evidence. But Maria Dineen says: ‘Witnesses cannot sit through any part of the proceedings, nor can they be told about what is occurring in court at any part. They should never have been in court.’ 

How come the new suspect turns up everywhere? 

What happened: Lee Ashworth (James D’Arcy) – who is the prime suspect in the Sandbrook abductions – has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up on the horizon and throwing menacing glances at Hardy. But bemused viewers have wondered exactly how Ashworth has been able to track down Hardy everywhere he goes so easily.

The newborn baby that can hold its head up at 24 hours old 

What happened: Those who watched last night's show criticised a storyline in which new mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, returned to the courtroom just hours after a home water birth. Viewers have pointed out that the baby then looked much too big to be a newborn and could even hold its head up at just 24 hours old.

A one in 7,000 occurrence

Fans of the show have pointed out that it would be highly unlikely to see such a diverse courtroom - with a female Asian judge, a black woman defence counsel and a white female prosecution counsel.

In 2010, 35% of barristers were women, and 10% were from ethnic minorities. Meanwhile in 2011, 22% of judges were women and 5% were from ethnic minorities.

That makes the diversity likelihood of the Broadchurch trial a one in 7,000 occurrence.
