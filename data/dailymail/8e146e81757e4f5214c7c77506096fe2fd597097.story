Euro 2016 was already proving a difficult child before it was announced recently that the hosts, France, would play in a qualification group - despite the fact that they could lose every game, not score and still be guaranteed to be at the tournament.

Previously known as 'the Euro for which it was harder not to qualify', the fact the hosts now avoid the perennial risk of two years without 'competitive' fixtures means it can now be viewed as a custom-made chance for Les Bleus to prepare for, then take advantage of, a home-based tournament.

No doubt for excellent logistical reasons, France have been given a leg up. If there's been less fuss made about this pretty bizarre twist than if the hosts were England, Germany, Italy or Spain, it could be because French football appears to be in an extremely parlous state.

Euro stars: France and Karim Benzema will play in a Euro 2016 qualifying group despite already being guaranteed a spot as hosts

It is the blink of an eye ago that they were rulers of the footballing planet. World Champions in 1998, kings of Europe two years later and within a couple of well-hit penalties of winning the 2006 World Cup.

Much of the way English football has evolved since the late '90s is directly linked to the French pattern of doing things.

Howard Wilkinson's Charter for Quality drew heavily on crosschannel learning, while the FA's St George's Park Training Centre used Clairefontaine National Technical Centre as its base model.

Spain's youth development guru, Gines Melendez, often jokes that La Roja sent 'busloads' of young coaches to learn how Nantes engaged in youth development in the 1990s.

Now, you can set aside the fact that France have needed the play-offs to qualify for two of the last three tournaments (including Thierry Henry's basketball trick against Ireland) and their utter humiliation during World Cup 2010 because, at one glance, the domestic product shows a grand malaise.

Ligue 1 is dull. Pitches are generally atrocious, the level of football isn't competitive, television revenue reflects the downturn in the product, hooligan behaviour remains a serious problem (there's an annual â‚¬30million policing bill) and there is a panic about the quality of young players being brought through the ranks. Even beyond the normal 'here's a stick, let's beat the ref' nonsense, there's a wide consensus that the officials in France are sub-standard.

The Government has introduced the infamous 75-per-cent tax law which will hurt many clubs; Monaco's response is to refuse to move from Monte Carlo into France and thus not pay tax at all.

When Barcelona thrashed Lyon 5-2 back in 2009, the president of France's dominant club, Jean-Michel Aulas, warned that Ligue 1 was already in the relegation zone of Europe's second division and that Germany, Spain, England, even Italy, were pulling away.

Leading the way: Didier Deschamps guided France to the World Cup via the play-offs

Since then, things have got markedly worse. Paris Saint-Germain are vastly wealthy, Monaco are the rich young upstarts - the rest are verging on cannon fodder.

Lyon failed to qualify for the Champions League, Marseille didn't make the knock-outs, none of the other Ligue 1 clubs reached the last 32 of the Europa League. Internal critics queue up: 'The first criteria applied in evaluating a competition is the state of the pitches,' said Cyril Linette, sports director at Canal+.

'If you flick between the Premier League and ours, the difference is shocking. Rather than buying another player, clubs should be thinking about hiring some good gardeners.'

Dull: The French division lacks the excitement of other major European leagues

Gerard Houllier: 'When I was France's 
technical director, I sent (then manager) Raymond Domenech to Argentina 
to see how they were doing things there. Down there, youngsters of the 
same age are much hungrier than us.

They're more mature, much tougher and are prepared to get a bit nasty on the pitch.' No matter their route to Brazil, there remains sufficient talent in Didier Deschamps' squad that, if the eversusceptible 'spirit' is buffed up, they remain a dark horse for the latter stages. The real fears are for what lies ahead, towards the sprawling and now decidedly odd 2016 tournament and beyond.

Francois Blaquart, who thinks his country hasn't just fallen behind Spain, Portugal, Holland, Germany, Italy and Belgium but even Canada in youth development terms, is the man charged with curing France's ills.

Back to basics: Technical director Francois Blaquart plans to rid France of its problem stars and produce loyal team players

He said: 'Club culture is a real problem - the strong identity that provides an anchor for young kids. 'Twenty years ago, Xavi was getting the metro every day to work on the same exercises and training techniques used today. Exactly the same!

'Even before that, Barca's coaches were instilling in him the club values. 'In France, players are like consumers in terms of relationships with their clubs, playing for six or seven years before they even get to a training centre and having no understanding of concepts like loyalty to the jersey.

'We will try to develop a less selfish footballer who plays with intelligence and creativity. 'We'd reached the point where the collective behaviour of our players had become a problem. They could handle the ball but, when it came to reading the game and playing in a team, there was a problem.'

Bonne chance, Monsieur Blaquart.
