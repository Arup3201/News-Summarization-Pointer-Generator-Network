If you are planning to bet on this year's Super Bowl, you might wish to consult an expert or two.

But instead of turning to typical psychics or football fanatics, why don't you ask this pair of manatees?

The marine mammals have proven success with picking the winning team - with one having correctly named the winner for the past six years.

Successful: Buffet the manatee boasts a higher success rate than his companion Hugh - having successfully named the winner for the past six years. He has picked the Denver Broncos to win at the Super Bowl XLVIII

Different opinion: Meanwhile, Hugh, pictured at the Mote Marine Laboratory, has opted for the Seahawks

However, the 'psychic' manatees have not been able to agree on a definite winner this year.

Buffet has picked the Denver Broncos to win at the Super Bowl XLVIII, while his friend Hugh has opted for the Seattle Seahawks.

The sea creatures, who were born in captivity, perform their predictions at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Florida, according to WTSP.com.

They manatees make their selections by swimming over to special targets, featuring the logos of the participating American football teams.

Trusting: Research supervisor Kat Nicolaisen, pictured, says she is trusting Buffet's prediction this year

Last year, the pair correctly picked the Ravens to win, while in 2012, they both successfully predicted that the Giants would succeed.

However, Buffett boasts a higher success rate than his companion - having correctly selected the Packers to win in 2011, as well as the winners in the previous three years. 

'I'm going with Buffett this year', said Kat Nicolaisen, research supervisor at the laboratory.

'It is pretty incredible that Buffett is now six for six. We don't know how he does it. The choice is totally up to him.'

Ms Nicolaisen is part of a team of researchers which studies the behaviour of manatees 
through training exercises to understand how to protect the 
marine mammals in the wild. 

She said the manatees' predictions were even more impressive considering the mammals are known for having poor eyesight.

The Super Bowl XLVIII is due to take place on Sunday, February 2 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
