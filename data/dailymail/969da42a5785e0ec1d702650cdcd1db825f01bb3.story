A drunken partygoer was captured on camera spitting out 165 swear words during a shocking 10-minute tirade against a bouncer who refused him entry to a bar.

The disturbing footage shows the middle-aged man ferociously ranting at the doorman during the hate-filled harangue in Canterbury, Kent.

Clips from the foul-mouthed episode, which took place on Christmas Eve, show the reveller telling the doorman he will 'slaughter his entire generation' and 'smash and batter him'.

A drunken partygoer was captured on camera spitting out 165 swear words during a 10-minute hate-filled tirade against a bouncer who refused him entry to a bar in Canterbury, Kent 

The shocking footage shows the middle-aged man ferociously ranting at the doorman, telling him he will 'slaughter his entire generation' and 'smash and batter him'

His face contorted with fury, the man then insists that he has been 'police, considerate and everything' - before challenging the employee to a fight.

He also says: 'I ain't no ordinary mortal', before the doorman attempts to move him away from the scene.

The footage was released by the doorman's boss at The Cuban, to illustrate the sort of behaviour with which doormen are faced.

It was filmed on a camera attached to the doorman's jacket at around 10.20pm on Christmas Eve.

Other revellers passing the bar witness the abusive onslaught, with one heard saying 'what a lovely man'.

At the end of the rant, another man appears at the front door, who appears to be waiting for a friend to emerge from bar.

He is seen trying to reason with the drunk and asks him where he is from.

The man replies: 'The local community. I’m going to a club. What you doing?' 

Oli Nonis, a director of Akon security, which runs the door at The Cuban, said: 'This is just an example of what we have to tolerate on a daily basis and are expected to just to put up with.

'It's not the norm for the average punter, but there are people who think it's okay to behave like this towards our staff.

'But they're professionals and properly trained and know exactly how to deal with situations like this.

'It also means we are able to ensure well-managed venues like The Cuban are free of drunks and potential troublemakers so people can enjoy their nights out without hassle.

'This situation also shows the effectiveness of the body-worn cameras in recording instances of disorder or crime.'
