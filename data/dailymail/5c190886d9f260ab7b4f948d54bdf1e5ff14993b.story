Balancing on a tightrope 450ft above a canyon Emily Sukiennik briefly locked eyes with her husband-to-be as he hurtled past her. 

Her  fiancé Mark Solper had just thrown himself off the top of the rocky outcrop and the ground was racing up to meet him.

But after the briefest of loving glances she continued with her death-defying 65ft-long wire walk above the gorge.

The look of love: Emily Sukiennik briefly locked eyes with husband-to-be Mark Solper as he hurtled past her

Balancing precariously 450ft in the sky Miss Sukiennik stole the briefest of glances as Mr Solper sped past 

Thrill-seeker Mr Solper yelled and screamed with enjoyment as he sailed through the air 

With her focus returned Miss Sukiennik was able to return her attention to crossing the 65ft long wire 

The couple decided to organise the unusual photoshoot because it combined things they were both good at

The pair, who have been together two years, orchestrated the daredevil duel stunt to keep the spark alive in their relationship.

Mr Solper is a keen BASE jumper and skydive instructor, while Miss Suiennik has walked more than 100 tightropes in various locations around the U.S.

They performed the simultaneous BASE jump and high-line tightrope walk in Utah to capture these stunning photographs on their anniversary.

To get the best shots the pair completed the hair-raising stunt a number of times, including at sunrise and sunset. 

'We decided to do this together because it combines both what I am good at and what he is good at,' she said.

Miss Sukiennik said it took a lot of planning and execution to get the eye-watering pictures perfect

She described the adrenaline-fuelled experience that they shared as 'absolutely incredible'

'We thought the photos would be spectacular. It took a lot of planning and execution to get the right shots.

'We did a sunrise shoot and a sunset shoot to get the best lighting. 

'I had to be in the perfect location on the highline for the photos and had to focus and stand there while I waited for Mark to make the jump.

'We tried to make eye contact when he jumped passed me and it was absolutely incredible.

'I could hear him yelling and screaming on the way down, he was so excited.'
