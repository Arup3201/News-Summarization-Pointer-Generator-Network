Clive Palmer has spent $26 million of his own money keeping his political party afloat in the last financial year. 

The Palmer United Party's donation records have revealed that $26 million of the $28.76 million it received, came directly from the politician and mining magnate's multiple private businesses.

Aside from a personal donation of over $100,000 from Mr Palmer himself, the rest of the money was donated via his mining company Mineralogy ($8.2 million), his nickel and cobalt refinery Queensland Nickel ($15.2 million), Palmer Leisure Australia ($90,283) and the Palmer Coolum Resort ($2.3 million).

The sum dwarfed the total amount of donations recorded by both the Labour and Liberal parties, which declared $8.4 million and $18.6 million respectively.

However, the Electoral Commission Queensland is still awaiting legal documentation in the form of an 'auditor's certificate' from the PUP, and a declaration of a further $6 million in donations that is currently part of a larger sum of money forming the subject of a civil trial and under investigation by police, The Australian reports.

Revelations of Mr Palmer's enormous expenditure have come only days after Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie departed from the group, leading the party's head to make an array of accusations.

Mr Palmer told ABC Radio that the established parties would always try and wreck new political movements like his, saying 'They try to infiltrate it and to blow it up'.

The revelation come a few days after Senator Jacqui Lambie quit the PUP, announcing that Tasmanians, not Clive Palmer, 'are my boss'

'She's been sent in there by someone to cause trouble, I think that's the reality of it.'

His party had a team investigating her, he said.

The PUP leader issued a statement accusing Senator Lambie of establishing the Australian Defence Veterans Party between winning the election and taking up her seat in the Senate for PUP.

Senator Lambie formally resigned from his party on Monday and declared that she will not form nor join another party, claiming it was a case of 'once bitten, twice shy'.

The Tasmanian Senator, 43, won a place in parliament at the 2013 federal election (September 7) and the 'deal-breaker' for her decision to go it alone was the overwhelming support from her home state and not her disintegrating relationship with Mr Palmer.

Senator Jacqui Lambie speaks in the Senate chamber in Parliament House in Canberra. Ms Lambie announced she would resign from the Palmer United Party and continue to serve as an Independent Senator

'I started thinking about where we were going about a month or 6 weeks ago, it's all come to a head, I didn't believe it was in the best interests of Tasmania and was better on my own two feet,' Ms Lambie said.

The pair has not spoken since Remembrance Day.

Her former party leader launched a broadside in an interview with Fairfax Media, telling them she pre-empted an imminent move by the party against her, by leaving. 

'I think you can understand that it's a good outcome for the party because her views are in conflict with what the people who elected her care about,' he said.

'I don't think she'll achieve very much as a senator generally.'

Jacqui Lambie took her place as deputy leader of the Senate for the Palmer United Party on July 1 this year but she was stripped of that deputy role in the Senate for PUP last week, following heated words with Mr Palmer.

If she runs into her former boss in parliament she said 'I'll just smile at him and say hello because that is the polite thing to do'.

Senator Lambie has called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to admit he was wrong on ADF member payments and Australians 'will forgive him'

'My resignation today will end that damaging speculation and uncertainty,' she told parliament.

'I must be free to vote in the Senate in the best interest of Tasmanians.'

Senator Lambie said she had been thinking over her party membership while she got legal advice on leaving PUP.

At a media conference she reinforced a determination to negotiate a better pay deal for Australian Defence Force members.

'The Prime Minister has done the wrong thing in this area, it takes a big man to admit he's wrong,' she said.

'If Mr Abbott rethinks the pay offer for ADF members then I'm sure Australians will forgive him. It's about our national security, about the morale of people who are putting their lives on the line.'
