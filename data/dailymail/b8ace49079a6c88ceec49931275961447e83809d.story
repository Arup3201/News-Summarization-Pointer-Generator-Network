The son of Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour was jailed yesterday after showing the ‘ultimate disrespect’ to Britain’s war dead by swinging from the Cenotaph during the student riots.

Charlie Gilmour, 21, reeled in shock as he was handed a 16-month sentence for his ‘outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour’ during a drug-fuelled rampage that also saw him attack Prince Charles’s car.

The Cambridge University history student was ‘out of his mind’ on a cocktail of LSD, Valium and whisky when he laid siege to the royal convoy during the tuition fee protests in London on December 9 last year.

He threw a bin at a car carrying 
royal protection officers and leapt on the bonnet of the vehicle 
escorting the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall to the Royal 
Variety Performance.

Gilmour, whose parents have a home in
 London as well as a £2.68million seafront mansion in Hove, East Sussex,
 was also part of a mob who ransacked TopShop’s flagship Oxford Street 
store, causing £50,000 worth of damage.

Yesterday the yob tried to excuse his
 behaviour, saying that he had not known it was the Cenotaph. But Judge 
Nicholas Price scoffed at the excuse, saying: ‘For you, a young man of 
undoubted high intelligence, education and background, to profess you 
didn’t know what the Cenotaph represented defies belief.

‘It’s through the deaths of those 
many thousands who gave their lives that you have been given the 
opportunity for the democratic right to protest, but you showed ultimate
 disrespect to those who fell defending their country.

‘Such outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour gives a clear indication of how out of control you were that day.’

The judge told how Gilmour’s conduct 
had prompted a deluge of ‘vituperative and in many cases obscene’ hate 
mail sent to his blameless family.

However, he accepted that  Gilmour 
had shown contrition the day after his actions, and stressed that his 
antics at the Cenotaph did not form part of the violent disorder charge.

But sentencing him at Kingston Crown 
Court, Surrey, he said: ‘I have to take into account that you have had 
many advantages which are denied to most young men who come before this 
court.  

‘I have no doubt you felt strongly 
about the legislation regarding student fees, but what you did went far,
 far beyond proper protest.’

Gilmour was wide-eyed in shock as he 
was led away by a prison officer, while his mother, writer Polly Samson,
 sobbed.Later, she and her rock star husband, who is worth an estimated 
£78million, hugged their son’s university friends, many of whom shook 
with emotion.

During the hearing, Gilmour’s lawyer 
wheeled out no fewer than 13 character references, many from ‘very 
distinguished’ members of society, including BBC boss Alan Yentob and 
the chief executive of the homeless charity Crisis.

David Spens, QC, defending, said 
Gilmour, an ex-pupil at £9,000-a-term Lancing College in West Sussex, 
was a ‘gentle’ student who had been subjected to ‘serious bullying’ in 
the past.

He said the second-year student – who
 was adopted by Dave Gilmour – had been catapulted into a downward 
spiral of drink and drugs by a disastrous meeting last year with his 
biological father, the radical playwright and poet Heathcote Williams.

Mr Spens said: ‘For a period of time 
starting around August 2010 he was, by his own admission, on something 
of a continual binge, taking a range of illicit and illegal drugs. In 
his own words, he spent most of the week, effectively every week, 
tranquillised out of his mind.

‘This young man has had to cope with 
the pain and considerable emotional upheaval of having a biological 
father who rejected him for no good reason and has continued to reject 
him throughout his life.’

Mr Spens said Gilmour had now sought help from a psychotherapist, had stopped using drugs and cut down his drinking.

Gilmour admitted violent disorder at a hearing in May, but denied he was responsible for the bin attack.

A spokesman for Girton College, 
Cambridge, said he could not comment on whether Gilmour would be allowed
 to return to finish his course.
