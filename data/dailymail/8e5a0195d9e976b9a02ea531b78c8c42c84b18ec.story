A magnitude 4.4 earthquake rolled through Southern California around dawn on Monday, giving people across Los Angeles a rude awakening.

Seismologists orginally put the temblor at an estimated 4.7 after it struck at 6:25am.

It was soon downgraded, but the shakeup was enough to give the City of Angels aggravating start to their work week.

'We're having an earthquake!': The 4.4 quake hit as just KTLA aired its morning news. Here, anchors realize what's happening just in time to dive under their desk

As it happens: Anchors Megan Henderson and Chris Schauble took cover under their desk on air as the quake hit during morning news

Startling: The quake was clearly felt quite strongly in the Hollywood KTLA studios, but no damage was reported

The quake was centered 15 miles west-northwest of the downtown civic center and occurred at a depth of about 5 miles.

'It felt like a bomb going off underneath our house,' said George McQuade, a West Hills resident. 'Nothing was damaged, but it sure woke everyone up. It was an eye-opener.'

A live KTLA feed posted by YouTube user KTLA KING shows morning news anchors taking cover just as the quake struck.

'We're having an earthquake!' exclaims anchor Chris Schauble as he and co-anchor Megan Henderson dive under their desk.

It was over almost as quickly as it had begun, but a quick cut to a KTLA correspondent in the field a few miles away revealed he'd felt it, too.

'It was a definite jolt, just one single jolt and I haven't seen the magnitude,' said Eric Spillman. 'But it definitely something we could feel here in downtown,'

Exactly what they're supposed to do: When experiencing an earthquake while indoors, experts recommend you get under a desk or table if at all possible. If there is no available desk or table, you should stand against an interior wall

The epicenter was 6 miles from Beverly Hills, 7 miles from Universal City and 7 miles from Santa Monica, the USGS said.

The Los Angeles Fire Department has received no immediate reports of damage.

All
 Metro rail lines were expected to experience minor delays this morning 
as crews inspect tracks for possible damage, according to Metro.

It
 was one of the largest quakes to hit Los Angeles since the 
6.7-magnitude Northridge quake killed several dozen and caused $25 
billion in damage two decades ago, Dr. Lucy Jones, a USGS seismologist, 
told KABC-TV.

'It's not
 that large by California terms. It's the size of earthquake we have 
across the state once every couple of months,' Jones said. 'But we 
haven't had one like this in LA for quite a while.'

A magnitude 4.7 quake struck near Inglewood in 2009, she said.

Did you feel it? The USGS says the 4.4 quake struck about 6 miles from Beverly Hills at a depth of 5 miles. It could be felt from the San Fernando Valley to Long Beach

Rolled through SoCal: The quake could be felt across the LA area from the San Fernando Valley to Long Beach. Scientists said it was a 'typical' Southern California earthquake of 'moderate' intensity

Meanwhile, Chile’s northern Pacific shore was rocked by a 6.2-magnitude earthquake  just hours after a stronger 6.7-magnitude quake hit the same region.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has no tsunami warning in effect.

The U.S. Geological Survey reports that this latest quake hit late Sunday night.

The USGS report says the earthquake 
occurred offshore at a depth of 6.6 miles. Its epicenter was 46 miles 
northwest of Iquique, Chile.

The region has had a series of strong shocks since the quake earlier Sunday, registering between 4.9 and 5.2 magnitude.

The
 earlier quake caused more than 100,000 people to briefly evacuate some 
coastal areas as a precaution. Minor damage was reported.

Chile is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.

Meanwhile, in Chile: This map, released by the U.S. Geological Survey, shows the point off the Chilean coast where their 6.7 mag earthquake happened Sunday evening

A pattern? People stay on higher grounds in a tsunami safety zone after the first quake, a magnitude 6.7, hit just offshore from Iquique city, north of Santiago, Chile on Sunday evening. It was followed by multiple smaller quakes thereafter
