Slobs are people who are 'lazy and dirty or messy' or just simply 'ordinary', according to the dictionary.

They are also the offensive lineman for the reigning NCAA football champion Ohio State Buckeyes.

Being a slob requires a player to be 'mean' and 'nasty', be able to work hard' and 'know how to eat'' like a 'human garbage disposal'.

Members of the Ohio State Buckeyes offensive line (some pictured) affectionately call themselves 'slobs'

Former Buckeye Andrew Norwell, who now plays guard in the NFL for the Panthers, created the name in 2013

Junior  Chase Farris said: 'When we slob, we slob together. There's no single slobs. It's just a group of slobs'

Former Buckeye Andrew Norwell, who now plays guard for the Carolina Panthers in the NFL, created the name in 2013, according to The Zone. 

Norwell came up with nickname while he was drawing pictures in the team's meeting room. 

Right guard Pat Elflein explained: 'He'd just draw a bunch of goofy pictures and just mash a bunch of animals together.

'He'd just make them look real funny together, and one of them, he made one of them and he called it a slob.

'It was a big, ugly, thing and it just kind of caught on that we're the slobs.'

The name caught on and the guys on the team kept using it when Norwell moved on.

They will continue to use the affectionate term in the coming season as four out of five of the team's starting offensive lineman will be returning, the Columbus Dispatch reported.   

Junior linemen Chase Farris said: 'A slob isn't what you look like, a slob is how you act, it's what you are, it's what you do.'

'We go eat, we slob. When we're together in the meeting room, we slob. 

'When we're on the field, we slob. 'When we slob, we slob together. 

'There's no single slobs. It's just a group of slobs.' 

Despite the funny nickname, left guard Billy Price (wearing No. 54) said a lineman has to be good to be a slob

Right guard Pat Elflein (No. 65) explained Norwell drew a goofy, ugly picture and then called it a slob 

The Ohio State Buckeyes beat the Oregon Ducks by a final score of 42 to 20 in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game at AT&T Stadium on January 12, 2015 in Arlington, Texas

Despite the funny nickname, left guard Billy Price said a lineman has to be good to be a slob. 

Offensive coordinator Ed Warinner will be in charge of finding a slob to fill the vacant spot.

 He said: 'I mean, they are human garbage disposals.

'They eat 8,000 calories a day, and they look pretty good doing it, so if I tried to keep up with them you'd have to get 4XL for me.'

The slobs protected third-string quarterback Cardale Jones during the first College Football Playoff national championship game and Ohio State trounced the Oregon Ducks 42-20.

The team's defense was able to contain Heisman winner Marcus Mariota and the Buckeyes ended the season with a 14-1 record.
