A real-life Billy Elliot who feared he was paralysed in an alleged street attack today said he WILL dance again after making a miraculous recovery in time for Christmas.

Professional ballet star Jack Widdowson, 19, suffered serious spinal injuries as he walked home from a night out last month.

His family rushed to his bedside and doctors feared he would be never be able to dance again after the incident in Cardiff, south Wales.

But the determined teen has defied medical expectations and is now back home with his family - even managing to walk short distances unaided.

He now hopes to get back dancing and resume his apprenticeship with the prestigious Bern:Ballett company in Switzerland.

His family claim it was the ballet training that saved Jack’s life by enabling him to recover so quickly.

Jack said: 'Ballet is my passion and this incident has made me realise that now more than ever. I don’t want this injury to define me or my career.

'With long and difficult hydrotherapy and physiotherapy sessions, I keep focussed on the end goal, which is to dance again and hopefully continue my apprenticeship.

'The support that I have 
received from family, friends, colleagues and tutors both in the UK and 
Switzerland has been overwhelming and their messages really helped.

'Especially
in those first few weeks when it was taking an enormous amount of 
effort and concentration just to re-learn how to do everyday activities 
such as holding a cup on my own and playing hangman with family 
members.'

Rising star: Jack in his days as a member of the Bern: Ballet company Switzerland. He is determined to return to his apprenticeship before too long

Jack’s family, including parents Julian and Celia, two brothers George and Mark and sister Chloe, held a bedside vigil after the attack in Cardiff on November 5.

The stage star, from Farmborough, north east Somerset, was walking home from a night out in the city and had become separated from his friends when the incident happened on a canal path.

He was found by fellow revellers an hour later and taken to the University Hospital of Wales - but has now been discharged earlier than expected.

His dad Dr Julian Widdowson, 52, head of sports medicine at Bath Rugby and CircleBath Hospital, said he could not believe how much progress he had made.

He said: 'It feels like an absolute miracle.

'When Jack first regained consciousness we were unsure of the extent of the long-term damage and feared that he may have been paralysed from the neck down.

'However, by some stroke of fate this was not the case and a number of small, positive signs gave us hope.

'Up until a week ago we didn’t really expect to have a Christmas this year, however, now that Jack is back home and showing such strong signs of recovery we really do feel it is an occasion to celebrate.'
