These touching photographs show a lioness adopting a helpless antelope calf - after she killed its mother.

The intimidating beast had just finished devouring a Ugandan Kob, and had the wounds to show for it, when its terrified child emerged.

Instead of making the defenceless infant her dessert, however, the merciful creature took pity on it and carried it away to safety.

Photographer Adri De Visser, 50, captured this fascinating display of nature in its purest beauty at every stage.

The lioness first stares at the calf in shock, before roaring angrily at it to make it go away.

Finally, her maternal instincts take over, and after batting the quivering calf with a paw, she picks up the orphaned baby and carries it off like one of her own cubs.

Other tourists in the Queen Elizabeth 
National Park, Uganda, later reported seeing the calf running around 
unharmed, so its luck clearly held out.

Mr De Visser said:  'I was told there were two lionesses close by feeding on a kill so I went to go take some wildlife pictures.

'When I got there, I saw the lionesses feeding on a Uganda kob's carcass.

'I followed them for a while and they went up a tree to rest from the sun.

'I was watching them when I heard a noise - it was the kob's fawn that had been hiding in the long grass.

Unfair fight: The larger creatures evidently decided she should protect the little antelope, despite them being natural enemies

'One of the lionesses heard it too and came down from the tree.

The kob is an antelope found across sub-Saharan Africa in the northern savannah.

They are usually found in floodplain grasslands, where there is an abundance of water and green grass.

Kob tend to be inactive during the heat of the day and live in groups of females and calves or just males.

'The fawn just stood there before running into the lioness. It went between its legs like it was trying to get its milk.

'The lioness was really confused and they stood there for around 45 minutes.

'Then a park ranger turned up on his motorbike which made a really loud noise, which I think frightened the animals.

'So the lioness picked the fawn up by the neck and carried it off like one of its own.

'We heard from a group of tourists that the fawn was later spotted alive and well.'
