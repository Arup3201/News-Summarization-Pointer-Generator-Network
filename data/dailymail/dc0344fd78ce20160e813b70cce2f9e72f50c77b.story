This staggering image reveals the true extent of the huge snowstorm dubbed Hercules that dumped up to two-feet of snow over the entire Northeast of the country, was responsible for the deaths of 16 people and is the herald of even colder temperatures to come.

Captured by NASAâ€™s Terra satellite, the image shows the actual color of the ground across a region where 100 million people have been affected by the deadly cold and fearsome snow drifts.

Stretching from Delaware and Maryland in the south to Quebec in Canada to the north, the blanketing of snow was the first major storm of 2014 - causing chaos in Boston, New York City and Philadelphia.

And that seems to have been just the start as the nation prepares for the Polar Vortex.

Many parts of the U.S. Midwest braced for a blast of Arctic air this weekend that could bring some of the coldest temperatures in two decades before advancing to the Northeast, where residents are still digging out from a deadly snowstorm.

Starting Sunday, the deep freeze will be felt in the northern U.S. plains, including North and South Dakota, and through the Great Lakes region and Ohio Valley, according to the National Weather Service.

It will be some of the coldest weather to grip the region in two decades, with blizzard conditions expected in the Central Plains and Great Lakes regions, forecasters said.

'The last really big Arctic outbreak was 1994', said Bob Oravec, a forecaster with the National Weather Service. 'Outbreaks like this don't occur everyday. They aren't unheard of, but they are unusual.'

This push of Arctic air could bring record low temperatures in areas from Montana to Michigan, and move to the Northeast where it will arrive by early Tuesday, forecasters said.

Chicago could be about negative 20 (minus 29 Celsius), he said. Pittsburgh could see temperatures about 11 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (minus 24 Celsius) by early Tuesday.

'Incredibly, it may feel as cold as negative 50 to negative 60 (minus 45 to minus 51 Celsius) on Sunday night over sections of the north-central states,' including Minnesota and Wisconsin, the National Weather Service said in a statement.

In those conditions, frostbite can set in on exposed skin within five minutes, forecasters warned.

Preparing for the dangerous weather, officials in several states asked residents to use extra precautions when outdoors.

'It's the mother lode of cold air,' said Weather Channel coordinating meteorologist Tom Moore. 'On the heels of what will be the coldest air of the season, will be dangerous, life-threatening winds.'

Moore said that as the freakishly cold weather hits the region, authorities need to act fast to avoid a human catastrophe because of the chill.

'Anybody living out on the streets needs to be rounded up and put into a shelter,' said Moore to MSNBC News.

'The repercussions for not could be deadly, and I'm afraid we're going to see cases like that.'
