Italian police are set for their first-ever nationwide strike in response to 'mudslinging' by authorities after more than 80 per cent of officers in Rome called in sick on New Year's Eve.

Members of police union Ospol-CSA - which represents nearly 60,000 officers in 8,000 Italian municipalities will walk out for 24 hours and stage a rally in Rome in solidarity with their colleagues on February 12.

The strike was called after politicians, including Rome's mayor and Italy's prime minister, rebuked the force over a mass sickie pulled by 83.5 per cent officers slated to be patrolling the streets on New Year's Eve.

Francesco Garofalo, director general of Ospol-CSA, said politicians had 'unleashed a defamatory mudslide' against Rome's police,' the Telegraph reported.

'The straw that broke the camel is the infamous avalanche of mud against the body of the Local Police of Rome Capital launched by the institutions, and the City Government,' said Ospol-CSA in a statement.

'The strike is motivated by the continuation of a dispute over ten years, always evaded by governments that have followed, who belittled the role and functions of men and women in uniform of the Local Police.'

Striking officers will gather in the centre of Rome on February 12 and march two miles from the Piazza della Repubblica to the Piazza SS Apostoli.

On New Year's Eve, when 130,000 revellers flocked to a free outdoor concert in Rome, most police called in sick. A remarkable 10 per cent of them claimed they were unable to come to work because they were donating blood.

Of the 1,000 officers on the rota to work that night, only 165 officers turned up, according to the government. Around 30 have since been found to have no justification for their absence and are facing disciplinary action.

Mayor Ignazio Marino claimed the stay-at-homes were protesting his new policy to give raises only to harder workers. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi rebuked the force and called for a shake-up of public sector employment.

'I read that 83 per cent of police did not work 'because of illness' on December 31. This is why we will change the rules of public sector employment in 2015,' the prime minister wrote in a tweet at the time.

The absences meant the Italian capital was badly underpoliced as thousands of drunken revellers surged through its historic piazzas, reportedly letting off powerful fireworks and flares.

Ignazio Marino, the mayor of Rome, wrote on Facebook: 'They didn't manage to ruin the party, but those responsible will have to be held to account.'

The absences followed a months-long rift between police and the government over changes to salaries and working conditions.

The municipal police, known in Italian as 'vigili', denied that they were being lazy, saying their absence was part of a broader dispute over pay, conditions and staffing levelsl.
