The start of the Great British summer might typically see people seek shelter from the sunshine.

But in one of the wettest, coldest and dullest June's since records began, taking refuge under a sink from yet another downpour was all part of the start of summer for youngsters attending a Gloucestershire show.

And elsewhere, the story wasn't much different as storms and hailstones as big as golf balls were all scenes which unfolded due to June's unseasonable weather.

Visitors to the Cotswold Show in Gloucester today had to put up with the unseasonal conditions for June

Average rainfall over England and Wales,
including an estimated figure for today, was 157mm - more than twice 
the average for the period between 1981-2010.

The wettest June recorded previously was in 2007 when there were heavy floods in the north of the country.

Previously, the second wettest June was 
in 1912 and the Met Office said that we have already far surpassed the 
amount of rain that fell in that month.

The equivalent figures for Scotland were 104mm and 171% of the normal amount of rainfall, and for 145mm, which is twice the typical amount expected in Northern Ireland.

As well as being amongst the wettest Junes on record, the month has also been one of the dullest

It has already been confirmed that this month has been the wettest June in Wales.

June 2012 was also the dullest since 1909 and the coldest since 1991.

Average sunshine over England and Wales, including an estimated figure for June 30, was 123 hours, which is a mere 64% of the 1981-2010 average..

In Scotland, there were 123 hours of sunshine and in Northern Ireland, an unseasonable 136 hours.

And it doesn't look like the start of July will be much better as Chris Burton, of forecasters Meteogroup, said: ‘Next week looks unsettled again with lots of wet weather around.’

The torrential rain and fierce storms have been put down to a weather phenomenon known as the Spanish plume, forecasters said.

The pattern occurs when warm, moist air sweeping up from the south is lifted by a cold weather front from the west bringing prolonged and exceptionally intense downpours.

Paul Knightley, senior forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: 'It is a pattern that when it sets up in the correct fashion will produce spectacular thunder storms.'

The Spanish plume was behind three 
rare 'super cell' thunderstorms that swept across the Midlands this week
bringing hailstones the size of golf balls in some areas.

The Godiva Festival due to take place in Coventry's War Memorial Park over the weekend that was expected to attract more than 100,000 revelers has been cancelled due to the heavy rain.

Elsewhere, swathes of the Midlands were hit by 
intense downpours, with some parts receiving almost an inch of
rain in just an hour - a third of the average rainfall for the whole 
month of June.

The dreadful weather this month also caused transport headaches for thousands.

A landslide caused by a torrential downpour led to a freight train derailing, blocking the West Highland railway line.

The 24-wagon train came off the tracks between Corrour and Tulloch on the 28th June as a result of a huge influx of rain.

The final figures for this month's rainfall will not be released until June 2nd by the Met Office, but it is anticipated that rainfall will be amongst the highest ever for the month.

186.3mm of rain fell in the country beating the previous highest amount of rainfall for June - 183.1mm - which had been set in 1998.

As well as having to put up with a higher than average amount of rain, people looking forward to enjoying the sun have also been disappointed this month.

Temperatures have been below average, with a mean temperature of 11.9c - 0.7c below average for June, and the Central England Temperature of 13.6C (56F) was 0.9 degree Celsius below the average for 1981-2010 - the lowest in June since 1991.

As well as the Spanish Plume, one of the main factors behind the dull weather so far this month has been the position of the jet stream, which has been much further south than usual.

This has led to low pressure systems ending up close to the UK for almost the whole month.

Despite the mostly dreadful weather this month, however, June appeared to end with a slight and brief spell of more typical conditions for the month.

Yesterday saw a patch of hot and humid air pushed up into the country from Spain, which led to warm and muggy conditions.

The temperature in St James's Park in central London even reached 28.4c.

Typically, the sunshine did not last in many parts of the country, though, and there were thunderstorms across the UK.

Northern Ireland and Scotland were worst affected by the sudden downpours and a staggering 1,000 lightning strokes hit the UK during a five minute period yesterday.
