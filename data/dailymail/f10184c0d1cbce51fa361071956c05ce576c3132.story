A former master at a prestigious boarding school who sexually abused boy pupils was allowed to resign rather than face a police inquiry as part of an establishment cover-up, it has emerged.

Keith Cavendish-Coulson, now 71, befriended the youngsters, who were aged between eight and 13, before molesting them in classrooms, their dormitories and his private quarters in the 1970s.

The abuse was an ‘open secret’ among the boys at the £13,000-a-year Terra Nova School, near Holmes Chapel, Cheshire.

Its past pupils include Olympic sailing gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie and David and Victoria Beckham’s eldest son, Brooklyn.

But despite repeated complaints from pupils and their parents, Cavendish-Coulson’s abuse was covered up by the headmaster of the preparatory school, who was worried about the ‘untold damage’ that would be caused to it. 

Instead the French and music teacher, known for his tall stories, was allowed to resign for ‘health reasons’ rather than be sacked.

The Education Department was informed about the allegations and Cavendish-Coulson was later barred from working at schools. 

But officials failed to talk to victims or call in police.

As a consequence, he was allowed to work as a private tutor for many years, even coaching boys from Eton for a short time in the 1980s, before the headmaster checked his credentials and stopped him contacting pupils. 

Cavendish-Coulson also secured posts at at least three other independent schools, before being found out and dismissed.

Although he was investigated by police in 1998 and 2005, no action was taken against him until November 2012 when officers reopened the case following a complaint.

Cavendish-Coulson, of Crookham, Berkshire, was due to stand trial at Chester Crown Court but  dramatically changed his plea to guilty on Wednesday and admitted 41 sample counts of indecent assault on 24 boys under the age of 14.

He also admitted a single count involving the 13-year-old brother of a girl he home tutored in the 1980s. He is facing a substantial prison sentence when he is sentenced today.

Cavendish-Coulson arrived at Terra Nova in 1973. Anne Whyte, QC, prosecuting, said he was allowed to resign in November 1975 after the mother of one boy told the then headmaster she had caught the teacher in a ‘compromising’ position with her son.

In a letter to a father, headmaster Andrew Keith admitted Cavendish-Coulson had done a ‘great deal of damage’ to the boys, but added: ‘It would do untold damage to the school if parents wished to take proceedings against Mr Coulson and… the quicker we can forgive and forget the better.’

A letter from Cavendish-Coulson’s GP, unearthed by police, also advised that the ‘matter should be dropped’ so as not to ‘stir up a lot of trouble unnecessarily.’

One of the victims of Cavendish-Coulson (pictured) has described the impact of the abuse he suffered

A boy persistently abused by Cavendish-Coulson between the ages of nine and 11 described in a victim impact statement, what happened to him and its effects. 

The married father of two, now aged 50 said: ‘When I was sent to board at Terra Nova School I was seven. 

'I suffered from home sickness most of the time and yearned to be home with my parents. 

'I felt abandoned, lonely and frightened.

‘The school was a violent, authoritarian place. Bullying was rife and corporal punishment was common. It was a dreadful place. It was the 1970s, but more like Tom Brown’s school days.

‘It was in this kind of environment that Keith Cavendish-Coulson befriended me. He was kind to me. 

'He spoke to me softly and gently. He took advantage of my neediness, my vulnerability and instead of looking after me he used me for his own sexual gratification and he groomed me.

‘I knew it was wrong and horrible what he was doing, but I was completely unable to stop him. I felt totally frozen and horrified. It was humiliating. Sometimes it was also physically painful… but I didn’t feel capable of telling anyone.

‘I can say with absolute certainty that the experience of being sexually abused by Keith Cavendish-Coulson had a devastating effect on my life. Most of the time I am an emotional wreck, lacking self-esteem, plagued by depression.

‘I do not stand here a broken man. I’ve worked hard in therapy to understand what happened to me.

‘I have a lovely wife and two beautiful daughters, who feel like a real achievement which I am very thankful for.’

Mrs Whyte said the letter highlights that there was a ‘professional culture’ of assuming that the best response was to sweep such matters under the carpet. 

There was a ‘collective silence’ on the part of adults, professionals and possibly parents. 

‘Other considerations took priority over the social welfare of victims and over Cavendish-Coulson’s criminal culpability,’ she added.
