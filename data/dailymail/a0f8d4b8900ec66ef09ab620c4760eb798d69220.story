A husband is suing hospital officials in China after he found his dead wife alone on an operating table following the birth of their son.

Liu Hsiung, 29, had asked nurses for updates on his wife Zhang Chun, 27, after he was warned she was suffering critical complications at the Xiangtan Maternal and Child Health Hospital, in southern China.

He said: 'I kept being told she was in the operating theatre, but it looked at if it was closed and no one was there.'

Liu Hsiung is suing a hospital in China after he found his dead wife alone on an operating table following the birth of their child

Hsiung, 29, had asked nurses for updates on his wife Zhang Chun, 27, after he was warned she was suffering critical complications 

Hours later Hsuing finally managed to force his way into the operating theatre, where he found his wife's body on the table with a cleaner sitting nearby smoking a cigarette and eating a coconut. The baby survived the birth.

He said: 'I was going out of my mind outside wondering what had happened, yet they had gone home and my dead wife was left on a table in front of a guy eating his lunch.'

He added: 'When I got into the room it was too late she was already dead and none of the surgical or medical team were anywhere to be seen.'

Hospital officials have said complications arose after Hsiung and his wife Chun refused a Caesarean section because the baby was so large.

A hospital spokesman said: 'After giving birth, the patient suffered from excessive bleeding. 

'As an emergency her uterus was removed after five hours, but it was not enough to save her, and she passed away that night.'

An official inquiry found Chun died of a rare condition, an amniotic fluid embolism.

But Hsiung is suing hospital authorities for compensation claiming they bungled the delivery.

'The reason they kept me away for so long was to give themselves time to cook up their story and get rid of incriminating evidence,' he said.

'But I want to see all the papers, all the medical records and all the statements,' added Hsiung.

A hospital spokesman confirmed: 'We are in negotiations with the patient's husband and family over compensation. We admit that not everything went as it should have done in this case.'
