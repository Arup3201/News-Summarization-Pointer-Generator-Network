Asteroids in our solar system are thought to contain millions of pounds worth of minerals - and that's just a fraction of what neighbouring planets may hold.

The wealth of materials is so rich, in fact, billionaires including the likes of Google’s Larry Page and Avatar director James Cameron are racing to be the first to harness these goods.

And now a Californian artist has imagined the epic machines and structures needed by futuristic space miners to carry out these tasks, as we look to colonise and explore nearby planets.

The concept images were created by Californian artist Cuba Lee. He depicts how space miners on large crafts (pictured) could extract minerals from space.  Asteroids in our solar system contain millions of pounds worth of minerals and firms are looking to harness these materials in the near future

Cuba Lee is a freelance artist, currently at Section Studios in Los Angeles. He specialises in concept artwork based on science, and science fiction. 

Although Cuba Lee’s images are concepts, space mining is an avenue being explored by firms and entrepreneurs. 

Asteroid mining involves exploiting raw materials from near-Earth rocks.

Such asteroids are thought to contain a wealth of materials including gold, iron, nickel, titanium, hydrogen and oxygen.   

The company leading the charge when it comes to asteroid and space mining is Planetary Resources - set up in 2012 with backing from Google’s co-founders Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, as well as Avatar director James Cameron. 

Of the 9,000 known near-Earth asteroids, there are said to be more than 1,500 that are energetically as easy to reach as the moon.

In one of his images, called Fuel Mining, Mr Lee depicts a large chamber that resembles circular gas plants on Earth.

Hot gases are seen flowing through the floating chambers, attached to large power units.

In another, drills, similar to those used on industrial plants, are seen puncturing rocky terrains.

A huge craft that looks as if it’s been crafted from an asteroid is fitted with a large-turbine style wheel, which could be used to generate a form of energy to power the drills and research units.

A futuristic office-style pyramid block is imagined in another image.

Although Mr Lee’s images are only concepts, space mining is an avenue being explored by firms and entrepreneurs.

The first step is to mine asteroids orbiting in the solar system.

Either these materials could be harvested as astronauts journey through space, or brought back to Earth and extracted for use.

Entrepreneurs are hoping to extract these materials after experts claimed Earth supplies of elements including zinc, tin, silver, lead, gold and copper could run out within the next 60 years.

Based on Lee’s vision of the future, transport vehicles could carry asteroids, or their materials, back to Earth or to other inhabited planets. They could also mine the materials mid-orbit.

A huge craft that looks as if it’s been crafted from an asteroid itself is shown in Mr Lee's images, fitted with a large-turbine style wheel. This could be used to generate a form of energy to power the drills and other research units (pictured)

The company leading the charge when it comes to asteroid and space mining is Planetary Resources - set up in 2012 with backing from Google’s co-founders Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, as well as Avatar director James Cameron and Professor Sara Seager from MIT. 

Of the approximately 9,000 known near-Earth asteroids, the firm claim there are more than 1,500 that are 'energetically as easy to reach as the moon'.

In May 2012, a site called Asterank, which ranks the profitability of asteroids, discovered that an asteroid in our solar system called 241 Germania contains $95.8 (£60) trillion of mineral wealth inside it.

This is almost the same as the annual GDP of the entire world.
