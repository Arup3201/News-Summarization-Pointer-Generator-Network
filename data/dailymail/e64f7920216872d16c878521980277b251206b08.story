Adam Lallana’s big-money move from Southampton to Liverpool is set to land AFC Bournemouth a massive windfall of £6.25 million.

A deal was struck between Saints and the Championship side after Lallana was poached from the Cherries’ academy at the age of 12. It was agreed that Bournemouth would get 25 per cent of any fee Southampton received for the England midfielder.

With Lallana on his way to Liverpool’s Melwood training ground to undergo a medical, the £25 million move is imminent.

Windfall: Adam Lallana's move to Liverpool will hand Bournemouth a passive payday

Having finished 10th last season following promotion from League One, the huge pay-out would help Eddie Howe establish the Cherries in their second season in the Championship.

Howe has recently lamented the potential loss of key members from his squad, having already lost last season’s top scorer Lewis Grabban to Norwich City. 

Grabban netted 22 of Bournemouth’s 67 goals, leaving Howe concerned at how he would replace the 26-year-old.

Moving on: Lallana first signed for Southampton aged 12, and made his debut for them in 2006

‘Keeping the squad together may be our hardest challenge, given how well they performed,’ he told BBC Radio Solent,

‘We’re still very ambitious and we want to exceed what we did last year.’

The signing of former Burnley midfielder Junior Stanislas was confirmed on Thursday but Howe will want to add to his squad and fulfil those ambitions when Lallana’s move to Anfield is complete.
