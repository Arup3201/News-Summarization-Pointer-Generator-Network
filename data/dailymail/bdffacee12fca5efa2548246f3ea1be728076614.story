Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini repeated his desire to keep James Milner after the club's fans chanted his name throughout a 4-1 win at Stoke City on Wednesday night.

Milner, City's best performer this season, was outstanding again at The Britannia, and scored their decisive second goal with a towering header.

The 29-year-old is out-of-contract at The Etihad Stadium this summer and keeping his options open with Liverpool and Arsenal among a number of clubs interested.

But thousands of travelling supporters made their feelings clear by repeatedly signing: 'James Milner, we want you to stay.'

Pellegrini said afterwards: 'Milner scored a beautiful goal but for us the most important thing is the way he works for 90 minutes.

'To sign a contract, you need both parties. I repeat, the club want Milner to stay here and Milner has to decide what he wants to do with his future.'

Sergio Aguero scored his first goals since December 3 as City won in the Premier League game for the first time since New Year's Day.

They remain seven points behind Chelsea but with Barcelona next up in the Champions League, Pellegrini accepts keeping Aguero fit – he recently missed five weeks with a knee injury – is key to their prospects this season.

'The most important thing for Kun is that he can play. The more minutes he has, the better he is. We know what he can do.'

Aguero, who also had a goal disallowed for handball, was substituted with a tight hamstring but expects to play against Newcastle on February 21.

Stoke manager felt Milner escaped an early penalty appeal after Peter Crouch's header hit his arm but said: 'Once Man City went 2-1 up, they picked us off.'
