Ministers have been banned from taking iPads into Cabinet meetings to stop them being spied on.

Intelligence agencies have demanded that tablet computers be removed from the room before David Cameron and his top team conduct ultra-sensitive talks.

It is feared the devices could be hacked by a foreign power and used as covert listening devices.

Secrets: Ministers have been banned from taking iPads into the weekly Cabinet meetings

Senior government figures claim countries including China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan could have developed viruses that would allow iPads and mobile phones to be used as bugs, even when they are switched off.

China in particular spends billions on its military budget, and has been accused of trying to hack into governments around the world.

At last week’s Cabinet meeting, ministers were briefed on how better use of technology could save the taxpayer billions.

Cabinet Office minister and Government Digital Service chief Mike Bracken used iPads to give a presentation on how the GDS would save the economy close to £2 billion a year within the next four years.

It went down so well, the presentation was greeted with applause from ministers desperate to find efficiency savings.

But as soon as the talk was over, security advisers insisted all the iPads be removed from the room.

It follows revelations that ministers in the most sensitive departments have been given lead-lined, sound-proofed boxes in which to put mobile phones when having high-security conversations.

Last week it emerged that delegates at the G20 summit in Russia were given ‘poisoned’ computer memory sticks.

As world leaders gathered in St Petersburg in September, those attending were given USB drives which contained viruses which could be used to access sensitive information held on any computer it was placed in.

Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council, ordered tests to be carried out on the memory sticks.

‘The USB pen drives and the recharging cables were able to covertly capture computer and mobile phone data,’ a secret memo said.

Foreign Secretary William Hague also revealed his own mobile phone has been modified by spy agencies to prevent him being targeted by China,

He said: ‘I think my phone has been modified by GCHQ enough that it'd be difficult, but I'm sure the Chinese have had a good go.’

Paperless: Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has urged other ministers to embrace technology to cut costs

Mr Maude has been a leading advocate of technology in government. Last month it emerged he grew so fed up with Whitehall’s ‘clunky and rubbish’ IT systems he had his own personal wi-fi network installed.

He became frustrated at the time it took to log on to government systems and wanted to use his iPad instead for non-sensitive material.

But the Cabinet Office minister was astonished to find that a multi-million pound contract signed by the Labour government did not include providing a easy wireless web access usually found in coffee shops.

Mr Maude was forced to take matters into his own hands when he could not get his phone or iPad to work in his Whitehall office.

He refused to use a high security computer issued by contractors under the Labour deal because it involved entering numerous passwords and could not use it to surf the internet properly.
