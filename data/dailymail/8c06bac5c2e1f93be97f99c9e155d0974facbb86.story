One of the fashion industry's pickiest characters has heaped huge praise on the city of London.

Speaking at the opening of Chanel's new flagship store on Regent Street the brand's head honcho Karl Lagerfeld declared 
that the British capital is 'more fun' and 'more alive' than his chi-chi home town of Paris.

The 80-year-old claims that Paris and London are the only two cities that he rates in the world, but says that Paris is 'dangerous' and 'polluted'.

Designer Karl Lagerfeld declared that London is 'more alive' than Paris as he opened Chanel's new flagship store on Thursday

He told the London Evening Standard: 'Do you know many cities after London and Paris? The rest is okay, charming, whatever you want. But for the moment, London is more alive for me.

'London is somewhere I know pretty well. I don't feel like a stranger here.

'London is better and more fun than Paris. Paris is dangerous, here you don't have the feeling of danger.'

Going on to grumble about the pollution 
in the French capital the senior fashionista, who is creative director 
of Chanel and Fendi as well as his own label, also admitted that he has 
no plans to retire, because there is nobody to take his place.
