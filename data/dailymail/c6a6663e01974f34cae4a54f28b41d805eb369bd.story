The owner of Britain's only super-size restaurant which served up food deemed 'unfit for human consumption' walked free from court today - after swindling £38,000 in benefits.

Inside the kitchen of Sizzle and Grill in Cardiff lay rotten 'green slimy, smelly' raw meat, Cardiff Crown Court was told but despite the findings, the restaurant remains open.

When food hygiene inspectors visited the site they found an opened bag of 'foul smelling' raw frogs' legs, dirt-encrusted taps and grease smeared walls and floors.

Paul Stevens, 54, has owned the restaurant since 2009 where delicacies included kangaroo testicles.

Stevens, who has been in the catering industry for 30 years, walked free from court today with a two year suspended sentence.

Sentencing, Mr PK Lewis said that the fact that no customers had been taken ill after eating the food was a 'stroke of good fortune'.

Stevens, from Splott, Cardiff, took on the restaurant in 2009 after a brief spell of unemployment but failed to declare his new circumstances - and continued claiming benefits.

Over three and a half years he claimed housing benefit, council tax benefit, carers’ allowance and incapacity benefit as the main carer for his disabled wife Cheryl.

The total sum racked up to £37,380, more than £10,000 a year.

While he was profiteering from the benefits claims, Stevens' kitchen was serving up 'exotic meat challenges' with zebra, crocodile and camel on the menu.

But inspections over at eight-month period revealed the kitchen on Cowbridge Road East, Cardiff,  to be a filthy pit, with pate past its expiry date, bags of rotting meat and only a dirty cloth for chefs to clean their hands on.

When inspectors visited the site Mr Stevens admitted the restaurant was not the 'cleanest place'.

His lawyer  Ruth Smith said: 'He said ‘I know our cleanliness is not up to scratch. We will get it done. I am not going to kid and say it’s the cleanest place.'

The fast food restaurant - whose delicacies include kangaroo testicles, scorpions, ants, and mealworms - claims to be the only place in Britain that serves huge mega-meals inspired by American TV show Man v Food, where host Adam Richman takes on a series of gut-busting gastronomic challenges.

Yet during the inspections, Cardiff council’s environmental health team found raw chicken stored alongside bread rolls, raw meat and fish stored with ready-to-eat foods and inadequate disinfectantand cleaning facilities.

The kitchen was also filthy with floors and walls covered in grease and food debris strewn with out-of-date meat and duck pate. Cutlery was dirty, cobwebs lined the ceiling and meals were warmed in a food-splattered microwave.

Staff were also failing to wash their hands while preparing food, but instead wiped them on a cloth left strewn on food surfaces.

There was also no soap at the sinks in the men’s toilets and the toilet seat, pan and flush were described as needing a 'thorough clean' by inspectors. The women’s toilet was also found in a putrid state, with cracked, dirty tiles.

Christian Jowett, prosecuting, said that Stevens had been 'confrontational and uncooperative' during a follow-up inspection despite serving food that was 'likely to be unfit for human consumption'.

'There was no cleaning schedule and there was no training procedure for staff, although Stevens said he was the only food handler,' said Mr Jowett.

'Meat was found out of date and green, slimy and smelly.'

Inspectors gave the Sizzle and Grill a food hygiene rating of 0, which means urgent improvement is necessary.

The restaurant, where Stevens still works and employ six members of staff, has now improved its rating to 2, meaning improvement is still necessary.

Ruth Smith, defending, urged the recorder of Cardiff, Mr PK Lewis QC, to consider a suspended sentence for Stevens as he cares for his disabled wife and also his mother, who has Alzheimer’s.

'I don’t agree that he said he didn’t do anything wrong,' said Ms Smith.

'He said ‘I know our cleanliness is not up to scratch. We will get it done. I am not going to kid and say it’s the cleanest place.'

The benefit cheat had swindled £40,000 in benefits over a three-year-period

Paul Stevens pleaded guilty to 18 breaches of food hygiene regulations and two counts of benefit fraud at Cardiff Crown Court

Ms Smith, defending, told the court that no-one reported being ill after eating at Sizzle and Grill.

'He realises what jeopardy he’s put himself into and all those around him,' she said.

Stevens pleaded guilty to 18 food hygiene offences and two counts of failing to notify changes in circumstances when claiming benefits.

Mr PK Lewis, sentencing, said inspectors found his restaurant in a 'shameful condition'.

'The fact that no member of the public was made unwell was a stroke of good fortune.'

Mr PK Lewis sentenced Stevens to a two-year suspended sentence for the food hygiene regulation breaches and a two-year conditional discharge for his benefit fraud.

He was also ordered to complete 150 hours of community service.

Mr PK Lewis said: 'I bear in mind that you employ a number of people at the restaurant and if I were to send you to prison they would lose their livelihood and that concerns me.

'When I read these papers my intention was to send you to prison.'
