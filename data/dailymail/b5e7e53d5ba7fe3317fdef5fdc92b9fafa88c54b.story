A drug dealer has been jailed for 30 years for shooting dead a 12-year-old trick or treater who had knocked at the felon's door on Halloween.

Quentin Patrick, 27, shot young TJ Darrisaw at least a dozen times with an AK-47 assault rifle after the schoolboy approached his home hoping to be given a traditional gift of candy.

The paranoid crack dealer attacked the boy, who was accompanied by his step-father and two brothers, believing he was a rival drug dealer coming to kill him over a drugs feud.

Local reports said Partick's girlfriend was 'freaked out' when she saw a crowd wearing masks outside their house in Sumter, South Carolina, and alerted the gunman to their presence.

Fearing he was about to be killed, Patrick unloaded 30 bullets into the family, killing TJ, hitting his parent and one brother and missing his other sibling.

While the others survived their wounds injuries, TJ died in hospital.

â€‹Patrick walked out of the house with his
hands up when police arrived.

Inside the property, detectives found $7,500, four ounces of cocaine and other drug paraphernalia.

He was
charged with drug dealing, murder, and illegal possession of a gun by a
felon.

U.S. District Judge Matthew Perry agreed 
with defense lawyers that Patrick didn't intend to kill the youngster.

Yesterday, he found the dealer guilty of voluntary manslaughter instead 
of murder. And he sentenced him to just 16 years, only months above 
minimum sentencing guidelines.

Patrick
had already been sentenced to more than 16 years in federal prison 
after pleading guilty to being a felon in possession of a weapon.
