Danielle Bradbery, the 17-year-old recent winner of The Voice has been signed as the newest face of Skechers sneakers.

The teenage country star's spring 2014 ad campaign for the brand's Bobs line, marks her first-ever fashion campaign.

She will appear in Skechers’s print and TV ads, as well as the brand's social media and marketing campaigns through 2015, reports WWD.

Danielle shot to fame on season 4 of The Voice, at which time she was only 16.

After winning the show in June, her first original single The Heart of Dixie, reached the top 20 on iTunes.

To celebrate her arrival as a Skechers ambassador, the brand’s president Michael Greenberg released a statement saying: ‘Danielle is a breakout star, and we are thrilled to have Skechers at the starting gate of her incredible career.

He added that ‘With a top-20 hit under her belt, she’s clearly talented and definitely one to watch. We see the same massive potential in Danielle as we did in Carrie Underwood when we signed her several years ago.’

His remarks are a high mark of acclaim for a young star who has previously cited Underwood’s career as a musical inspiration.

The Bobs brand that she is set to represent for spring 2014 is Skechers’s own answer to Toms.

Bobs are styled much like Toms inimitable flat shoes - which were modeled after a traditional Ageninian shoe called alpargatas.

Also like Toms, Skechers donates a pair of shoes to a child in need for each pair of Bobs that are purchased.

Of the line, Danielle said in a statement: ‘Bobs shoes have helped so many children in need with their donation program, and I love the fact that it really is a simple way for anyone to give back.’
