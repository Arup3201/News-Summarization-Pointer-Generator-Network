The letters demanded to know why Marc, who claimed Employment and Support Allowance, hadn't kept  appointments to help him find work

The family of a man who died ten months ago have slammed benefits bosses for repeatedly trying to contact their dead son to ask why he hasn’t been to see them about finding employment.

The letters demanded to know why Marc Whiteside, who claimed Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), hadn’t kept scheduled appointments arranged to help him find work, despite being told the 31-year-old had died.

More letters chasing Marc, who lived in Langley, for £268 he owed the DWP for a crisis loan he took out before he died in March have also been sent.

The DWP have apologised to the family for a ‘regrettable error’ and say they have taken action to stop any more letters being sent to Marc.

His father Terry, 66, who works at Springvale Household Waste Recycling Centre, said it was ‘unbelievable’ the letters were still arriving 10 months after his son died.

He said: 'Every time I ring them up they apologise and say the letters will stop, but they keep on arriving.

'It’s almost a year since he died and the letters are still coming, it’s just unbelievable.

A flagship government scheme to tackle Britain’s troubled families has helped just 720 people back to work.

The Whitehall spending watchdog warned the scheme, which set an overall target of getting 20,000 into jobs, was ‘under-performing’ and urged ministers to intervene more quickly when things go wrong.

The project is supposed to turn around families, by putting children back in school, cutting crime and helping thousands of parents back in work.

The Department for Communities and Local Government’s ‘troubled families’ programme has a budget of £448 million.

The Department for Work and pensions (DWP) aimed to get 22 per cent of people on the programme into work employment over three years to March 2015, with a budget of £200 million.

But the National Audit Office (NAO) said the DWP programme had achieved only resulted in 720 people finding work, just 4 per cent of its target.

None of the firms it was using to provide services had met the department's target.

'If I did something that caused as 
much distress as this at my work I would be sacked, instantly, yet no 
one at the DWP seems to be accountable.'

An
 inquest into Marc’s death is yet to take place, but the family say they
 believe his death was related to a prescription drug addiction which 
also prevented him working and led to him claim ESA.

The DWP have apologised to Terry Whiteside for the 'regrettable error'

His dad Terry said he didn’t want another family to have to wake up to find letters addressed to their dead relative sent to them by the DWP.

He said: 'Every time we get one of these letters I get very angry while my ex-wife gets really upset.

'I’ve written a letter to the DWP telling them exactly what I think of them but I dare not send it to them.

'I won’t accept them saying it’s a computer error as a computer does what someone has told it do to.

'When the latest letter arrived last week we felt we had no option but to go to the paper to try and get the DWP to do something.

'This year has been difficult enough for us all and we want to make sure another family doesn’t have to have the same battle with the DWP we’ve had.'

A spokesperson for the DWP said the letters sent to Marc had been generated automatically, but said no more would be sent.

They said: 'We apologise to Mr Whiteside’s family for this regrettable error.

'We have taken action to ensure further letters are not issued.'
