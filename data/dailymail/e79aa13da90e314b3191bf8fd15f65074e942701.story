The Tories' popularity surged to a 22-month high today as they opened up a five-point opinion poll lead over the Labour Party.

David Cameron shrugged off battles over welfare reform as figures put the Tories on 40 per cent for the first time since March 2010 - with Labour down to 35 per cent, according to the Guardian. The Lib Dems are trailing on 16 per cent.

And in a fresh blow to Ed Miliband, a separate survey in The Times revealed almost two thirds of Labour's own supporters cannot see him ever becoming Prime Minister.

five-point lead over Ed Miliband's Labour Party, according to a new 
survey today

The polls show that Mr Miliband's recent
attempt to reposition itself to appeal to middle class voters has 
failed with the party slipping back in recent weeks.

If a fresh election was held tomorrow, the latest figures suggest Mr Cameron would be on the cusp of winning an overall majority.

The last time the Conservatives held such a large lead was in June 2010 when they were eight percentage points ahead of Labour.

In the new monthly Guardian/ICM poll, the Tories are up three percentage points on a month ago while Labour are down one. The Lib Dems are also up one.

The grim news comes after Ed Miliband has endured a miserable month with Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, openly questioning his leadership.

In an outspoken attack, Mr McCluskey also suggested that financial 
support for the party could be withdrawn after Shadow Chancellor Ed 
Balls backed public sector pay freezes.

Mr Miliband has suffered a series of public relations disasters in recent weeks, including a blistering attack by Lord Glasman - one of his advisers - who accused him of having ‘no strategy, no narrative and little energy’.

Public: I find it difficult to imagine Ed Miliband running the country as Prime Minister

Labour voters:

The Populus poll in The Times today revealed 
support for Mr Miliband's party was falling - although Labour held a slight 
lead with 38 per cent of voters saying they would back them in a general election compared to 37 per cent 
opting who said they would go with the Tories.

But the Populus poll revealed the public cannot see him as Prime Minister.

The number of voters who 'find it 
difficult to imagine Ed Miliband running the country as Prime Minister' 
was growing - up from 63 per cent in September to 68 per cent in the latest survey.

Of those who said they could not see him
in Number 10, 38 per cent said it was because he was not up to the job,
33 per cent because they did not know enough about him and nine per 
cent because Labour are unlikely to win the next election.

Among the party's own supporters, 59 per cent said they could not see Ed Miliband as Prime Minister.

Today's figures will provide a huge 
boost to David Cameron after the government's welfare reform proposals 
were defeated in the House of Lords last night.

The average person can only bear listening to Ed Miliband for 28 seconds, new research revealed today.

Men and women were put in a test room to listen to Mr Miliband speak until they got 'bored' or 'irritated'. One person managed just four seconds.

The survey found only Amy Childs from the Only Way Is Essex left the room sooner.

In contrast, Brits typically enjoyed sitting in a room with three houseplants - a Croton, a Stephanosis and an Orchid - for 4 minutes 48 seconds.

The study by the Flower Council of Holland found footage of wildlife expert David Attenborough captivated people for longest, clocking up an average of 9minutes and 26seconds.

Five least stimulating celebrities (average time): Amy Childs (19 seconds), Ed Miliband (28 seconds), Christine Bleakley (59 seconds), Gavin Henson (1 minute 12 seconds) and Natalie Cassidy (1 minute 36 seconds).

Labour
joined forces with Church of England bishops and Lib Dem rebels to try 
to wreck flagship plans for a £26,000 annual limit on welfare handouts.

The ICM poll in the Guardian also revealed the wealthiest are most likely to vote Conservative.

Although the Tories enjoy a 12-point lead in the south, Labour are five points ahead in the north.

Among people in socio-economic groups A and B, the Conservatives had a 45 per cent of the vote and Labour 29 per cent.

Labour had a big lead among the lower groups - suggesting that the party are depending heavily on the poorest for their support.

Among the middle classes and in the Midlands - both key electoral battlegrounds - figures suggest Mr Cameron enjoys a healthy lead.

Over the weekend, a YouGov poll also found that a staggering 63 per cent of Labour voters want him to stand down before the next General election and 61 per cent do not believe he is the best leader for the party.

The results will alarm Labour MPs, who are increasingly dismayed by their leader’s declining popularity.

They also threaten to overshadow Mr Miliband’s recent attempts to relaunch his leadership with a series of policy shifts in a bid to broaden his appeal to middle class voters. 

Privately, most of his backbenchers believe the party should be between 10 and 20 points ahead of the Conservatives in the polls because of the coalition’s austerity measures.
