A British NHS worker was yesterday evacuated back to the UK amid fears she had contracted Ebola after being splashed with a patient's bodily fluids in Sierra Leone.

The female health worker was lying on a stretcher by a Swiss Air rescue plane covered in an insulating sheet surrounded by staff in protective suits and masks.

The woman is the third Briton to be evacuated from Sierra Leone by an ATI (Air Transport Insulator) after she was splashed with what is believed to be bodily fluids from a victim.

The woman, who was working for the British Red Cross, was splashed with what was believed to be a bodily fluid feared to belong to an Ebola victim on Saturday. 

She was taking off her personnel protective equipment (PPE) when the fluid came into contact with her eyes.

She is being taken back to the UK as a precaution, though she was yesterday deemed to be ‘low risk’.

The woman, who has not been named, was working at a treatment centre in Kono and was transported 90 miles across the country to Kerry Town treatment centre.

Then this morning she was moved to the international airport by the military. It is not known whether she will be treated at the Royal Free in London.

As the incident happened on Saturday and it was over 48 hours later, it was feared she could spread the virus to others. 

Public Health England (PHE) confirmed it was 'a highly precautionary measure'.

The woman has no symptoms, and will be monitored for the next 21 days to ensure she does not have the disease.

Professor Paul Cosford, PHE’s director for health protection and medical director, said: 'We are confident that all appropriate public health actions have been, and will continue to be, taken to support this individual and to protect the public’s health.' 

Deadly: This woman, giving advice to local women, is one of the few survivors of the disease

Yesterday a patient was admitted to hospital in Edinburgh after recently returning from west Africa, They were admitted to the regional infectious diseases unit at the Western General Hospital earlier on Monday.

Will Pooley, a volunteer nurse, contracted the deadly virus in August and was flown back to the UK by an ATI.

British nurse Pauline Cafferkey was treated in a London hospital after contracting Ebola in the country but she recovered.

She was diagnosed with Ebola following her return to Glasgow from Sierra Leone where she had a volunteer with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town.

And a Northern Irish nurse was transported by a medical plane from Sierra Leone a few weeks ago amid fears she had Ebola but she was given the all clear.

In Sierra Leone so far 3,341 people have died from the deadly virus, and there has been nearly 11,000 cases. 

Survivors: Nurses Will Pooley and Pauline Cafferkey both contracted the deadly disease, but survived

Meanwhile, Michael Fallon stepped onto the runway at Lungi airport, near Freetown, yesterday morning -  as the patient was being prepared to be flown out.

Speaking before meeting the President of Sierra Leone Ernest Bai Coroma on an official visit, Mr Fallon hailed the armed forces’ work in the region, where there are currently around 700 soldiers deployed.

He said: ‘We are one of only two countries that could do what we are doing in terms of deployments because we have got adaptable, deployable forces.

‘Look at our reputation in the world. Look at the respect at which our Armed Forces have. We have 90,000 forces in 50 different countries.’

Asked if the UK’s role across the world was diminishing, he added: ‘Our global reach if anything is bigger than what it was 30 years ago. We are doing lots of things across the world.’
