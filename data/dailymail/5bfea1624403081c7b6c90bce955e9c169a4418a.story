If you have trouble deciding what to have for dinner, help could soon be at hand – with your food texting to tell you it needs eating.

Scientists have developed a computer chip that can be inserted into food packaging and is able to assess when the contents are nearing their use-by date.

Computer chips which can assess when food is getting past its sell-by date could soon be inserted into some food packaging, an EU committee of peers has heard.

The chips could also potentially alert the owner by sending them a text message telling them they need to eat the food.

The new technology could be far more effective than traditional sell-by dates which do not account for the conditions it is being stored in.

It could also radically reduce the amount of food which is thrown away.

Food waste group WRAP said UK households throw away seven million tonnes of food every year, of which just over four million tonnes is avoidable, costing £12billion.

Committee chair Baroness Scott of Needham Market told environment minister Dan Rogerson that one witness giving evidence to the committee in the Netherlands said: ‘We’re quite close to commercial production of a small chip which would go into packaging which would measure the actual deterioration of the rate of food.’

She said that the current convention of the best before date ‘assumes that everything’s equal; it just assumes that you all keep your food at the same temperature whereas this would actually respond to what the real conditions are’, whereas the computer chip could even ‘send you a text to tell you that it needed eating’.

Mr Rogerson said: ‘I should be intrigued to know the range and amount of resource that would have to go into producing it.’

Lady Scott added: ‘I’m having enough trouble with my text messages without the fridge texting me.

‘Realistic or not, it’s interesting to see where innovation can lead.’

Fights waste: The development could help combat the 7million tonnes of food wasted annually in the UK

Food waste has been examined closely in recent months. Towards the end of last year, supermarket giant Tesco revealed it generated around 30,000 tonnes of food waste in the first six months of 2013.

The majority of the waste was made up of fruit, vegetables and bakery items.

It found that up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin, including 68 per cent of bagged salads, half of bakery goods and a quarter of grapes.

A lot of the food was thrown away by customers but large amounts were wasted because they were left on display too long.

The same EU committee was also told that £2.5billion of food is thrown away by British restaurants, pubs and the wider hospitality sector every year.

The waste - totalling 920,000 tonnes a year, enough for 1.3billion meals - costs each individual outlet an average £10,000 annually.

Giles Whitely, CEO of SWR waste management, said restaurants should promote the use of doggy bags to reduce waste volumes.
