Gary Melius, 69, is being guarded by police in hospital after an alleged botched hit on the castle owner on Monday

Oheka Castle owner Gary Melius, who was shot through the eye in an apparent assassination attempt, once had debts of $6million, court records revealed.

The political power broker, 69, is in a stable condition after being shot in an alleged botched hit by a masked gunman outside his Long Island castle on Monday.

Melius is said to deeply fear for his life and those of his family. He is being protected under police guard in his hospital room. 

Police have no suspect and no motive in the point-blank shooting of Melius, a multimillionaire hotelier.

However the high-rolling lifestyle of the political mover and shaker might offer some clues.

According to court records, Melius has a history of million-dollar debts - including owing $100,000 for unspecified reasons at Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1993.

The Key Bank, the Bank of New York 
and Dime Savings also sued Melius for close to $6million, according to filings. The IRS was also after the businessman - suing Melius for almost $200,000 in taxes in the early Nineties.  

Friends of  Melius have warned the masked gunman to turn himself in.

'We
 are going to find the guy who did this,' best friend Darren Aquino told
 MailOnline on Tuesday. 'This is not a sane man (the gunman). What kind of normal 
person would do that? The 
best thing he could do, this man, is turn himself in.'

Aquino described Melius, who he met at an event 10 years ago, as 'charitable', but admitted his wealth exposed him to threats.

'We don't know about motive for sure 
yet. Listen, people who are such a character like Gary are always a 
target. They always are,' he said.

'He's
 a good charitable man. He's the most giving guy I know. He's my best 
friend. I'm happy he got through this.'

Aquino said Melius is 'doing well' and surrounded by loved ones at North Shore Hospital in Manhassett.

Meanwhile, authorities are examining 
surveillance footage from the Gilded Age estate on Long Island's Gold 
Coast that has hosted the wedding of disgraced Congressman Anthony 
Weiner and closing scenes of Orson Welles movie, Citizen Kane.

The incident unfolded about 12.30pm on Monday, when Suffolk County police responded to a 911 call from Gary Melius's daughter.

Kelly Melius drover her father to hospital after she found him with a gunshot wound. Gary Melius was in surgery at a local hospital, and had been conscious and alert before going in, said Suffolk County Detective Sgt. John O'Sullivan.

Last year, Melius was part of a controversy that resulted in the ouster of then-Nassau County Police Commissioner Thomas Dale over the arrest of a witness in an election lawsuit.

The district attorney found that Dale had instructed officers to arrest a 29-year-old Roosevelt man, who had testified in an unrelated case that he had been paid to collect signatures for a third-party candidate.

Melius, a supporter of the third-party candidate, then contacted Dale seeking to have the young man investigated.

The young man was arrested on an outstanding warrant while riding a county bus on October 5th.

An investigation by the Nassau County district attorney found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing but raised questions about the ethics of Dale's actions, leading to his resignation.

Melius was 'alert and conscious and cracking jokes' before going into surgery', said Sgt. John O'Sullivan.

His close friend, former U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato rushed to his bedside, later tweeting: 'Friends, thank you for your kind words. Please keep my dear friend Gary Melius in your prayers.'

D'Amato was waiting to meet Melius for a meal at a local steakhouse when he was informed of his friends shooting.

'It was not a robbery,' Mr D'Amato said after leaving Melius' bedside according to Newsday.

'It was an attempt at assassination. He was at the Castle, outside. Nobody put a gun to him or said, 'We want your money.' They just shot him. The guy had a mask on.'

Indeed, investigators are now 
examining Melius' political dealings in the hope of finding any clues to
 enemies who would want him dead.

Baffled friends have said that they are holding out hope that security footage will lead them to the culprit.

'I
 know that they have video,' said Steve Schlesinger, chief counsel for 
the Democratic Party on Long Island and a close friend of Melius. 
'But I have no idea what that video shows yet.'

Indeed, police have said that they do not believe the shooting was random. A donor to both Democrat and Republican parties, Melius has contributed millions to charity.

Born in Queens, New York City, Melius began his career as a plumber, before getting himself into construction and property.

Becoming successful, Melius made a move for Oheka in the mid-1980s.

Melius
 lives on the sprawling estate along with his wife Pam and daughter 
Kelly and purchased the castle in 1984 for $1.5 million.

He sold it a few years later for $30 million but then regained ownership in 2003 - paying the same price.
