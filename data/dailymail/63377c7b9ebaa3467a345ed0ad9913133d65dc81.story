Victim: Mary E. Whitaker, 61, was found killed at her home in rural New York last week after a robbery

A violinist who was found murdered in her garage last week was the victim of a random robbery by two homeless men who wanted to money 'to live like rock stars', police have said.

Mary E. Whitaker, 61, was found with gunshot wounds to her chest and leg and a stab wound to the neck at her home in Westfield, New York last Wednesday.

Authorities have now said they believe homeless drifters Jonathan Conklin, 43, and Charles Sanford, 30, randomly targeted Whitaker's rural home near Lake Erie.

The pair met met in a homeless shelter in Erie, Pennsylvania several months ago and last week, Sanford told Conklin he was looking for a place to stay - and Conklin said he had a plan, according to the National Post. 

A friend drove them to Sherman, where they robbed an apartment of someone Conklin claimed owed him money. They stole shotguns and a .22-caliber rifle, the affidavit states.

They then took off on foot and arrived at Whitaker's home. Authorities told Buffalo News they believed the violinist had been targeted at her isolated home where she lived alone. Her closest neighbors were a quarter of a mile away.

Their intention was to rob the home because Conklin told Sanford he wanted to 'live like a rock star', authorities said. 

Sanford rang the buzzer around 7am and when the call went unanswered, he pounded on the door. When Whitaker opened the door, he asked to use the phone, saying he had run out of gas, and she handed hers over to him, police said.

Conklin then jumped out and yelled, 'This is a robbery', police said. Whitaker screamed and Conklin fired, hitting her in the chest, Sanford told cops.

She went to grab the gun and he shot again, hitting her in the leg.

Sanford told police he then took her to the garage and Sanford ordered him to use a knife on her neck to kill her - but he said he couldn't get the blade to go deep enough.

The men left her on the floor, took her credit cards and check book and fled, leaving her on the floor of the garage, authorities said. Her dead body was later found by two friends who had become concerned when they could not contact her.

Targeted: Investigators believe she was targeted because she lived alone in a rural home 

The two men then fled in her car and drove to Erie, where a woman they knew pretended to be Whitaker so they could buy a flat-screen TV.  

But the men were arrested on Friday after they were seen using the credit cards at a convenience store. They are being held without bail in the Chautauqua County Jail in Mayville.

Conklin and Sanford are facing in life in prison if convicted of murder along with additional charges of car-jacking and use of a firearm.

Ms Whitaker, who also had a home in Manhattan, belonged to the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra for four decades where she was a second violinist.

She would travel upstate to play with the renowned orchestra which draws musicians from around the country to play in its summer season.

Marty Merkley, director of programming at Chautauqua Institution, told the Buffalo News that the violinist's death was a 'tragic situation' and that the orchestral community was 'devastated'.

According to a friend on Slippedisc.com, Ms Whitaker graduated from Indiana University with a performance degree in violin and moved to New York City to begin her career. 

For 30 years, she has been a freelance musician who worked with orchestras including the New York City Opera Touring Company. 

She worked on Broadway show The Lion King and she also toured with Barbra Streisand during her 2006-07 North America and International Tour.

Ms Whitaker is survived by her sister Martha, who lives in St Louis.
