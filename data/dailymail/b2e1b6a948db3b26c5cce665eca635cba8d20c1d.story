The green-eyed monster got the better of one Columbian man who went into a blind rage with jealousy burning down 20 houses in his street after another man whistled at his wife.

The man reportedly heard the whistle in the streets in the city of Cali, Colombia as he stumbled home from a drinking session at 5am.

In his fury, he set light to his own home but the flames quickly spread from roof to roof engulfing neighbouring homes.

Before long much of the neighbourhood was in flames.

Neighbours say that the man had threatened his wifeÂ  with violence so many times in the past that they did not take his threats seriously.

Devastated neighbour Sandra Valencia said after the fire: 'He was always beating her and threatening that he would set fire to the house . But this time he actually did it.'

She continued: 'I was awoken by him screaming at her but it was only when a neighbour knocked on the door and said the houses were on fire that I realised.

'I ran with my four children and had to watch as my house burnt down.

'We have lost everything, now we must rebuild our house from the ashes.'

Neighbours told reporters that the dispute came about after the man thought he heard someone whistle at his wife and took the whistle as a secret message from a love rival.

It took fire crews with six engines to put the fire out and the area was evacuated.

The suspect is believed to have fled the scene before police arrived on the scene.

The Red Cross is currently providing support to affected families on the estate, which is home to 160 families.
