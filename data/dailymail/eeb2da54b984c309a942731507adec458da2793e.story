Iran has denied inspectors from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog access to a key military site - ratcheting up tensions between Tehran and the West and effectively ending a working dialogue.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors were turned away from a base in Parchin, south east of the capital, where intelligence suggests nuclear weapons could be in development.

It led to the UN declaring a two-day meeting, intended to calm fears over the Islamic Republic's disputed nuclear programme, to be a 'failure'.

And it said talks with Iran are now 
unlikely to be re-started - as the West continues to step up sanctions 
against the major oil producer.

The aborted meeting came after Israel said it planned to deploy rocket interceptors from its 'Iron Dome' defence system in the Tel Aviv region from Monday.

The technology, which is being incorporated into the 'heart of the Israeli military', served to fan speculation the nation is gearing up for conflict.

On Saturday Iran docked two warships at a Syrian port, and Iranian bombers have been accused of targeting Israeli diplomats across the world.

Israel has pointedly refused to rule out a military response, prompting British Foreign Secretary William Hague and the U.S. to warn such an offensive would have grave consequences for the entire region.

Moving forward: Iran has repeatedly denied it seeks nuclear arms and says its reactors are only for power and medical research

Mr Hague's rhetoric goaded Iran into 
cutting off oil sales to British companies after he also accused the 
Islamist regime of promoting terrorism.

But the move will have little effect on British firms, which get well under one per cent of their oil from Iran since the European Union has already slapped sanctions on the country.

The evolving conflict over Iran's nuclear programme is like a 'slow-motion Cuban missile crisis', a leading nuclear strategy expert has said.

Graham Allison, from Harvard University, said each side has only murky intelligence, leading to tempers running high and the danger of a devastating outcome.

He told MSNBC: 'As a student of history, I’m certainly conscious that when you have heated politics and incomplete control of events, it’s possible to stumble into a war.'

Watching Iran, Israel and the United States, he said, 'you can see the parties, slowly but almost inexorably, moving to a collision.'

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors wanted to inspect a site at Parchin, southeast of the capital, where it believes there is a containment chamber.

This, it understands, is used to text explosives and suggests that Iran is developing possible nuclear weapons - a charge that Iran denies.

The Vienna-based IAEA said in a statement: 'During both the first and second round of discussions, the agency team requested access to the military site at Parchin. Iran did not grant permission for this visit to take place.'

IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano added: 'It is disappointing Iran did not accept our request to visit Parchin. We engaged in a constructive spirit, but no agreement was reached.'

Earlier, Iran's envoy to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, told the country's ISNA news agency Tehran expected to hold more talks with the UN agency, whose task it is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the world.    

But Amano's spokeswoman, Gill Tudor, made clear no further meetings were planned and said: 'At this point in time there is no agreement on further discussions.'

Iran rejects accusations that its nuclear programme is a covert bid to develop nuclear weapons, saying it is seeking to produce only electricity.    

But its refusal to curb sensitive atomic activities which can have both civilian and military purposes, and its track record of years of nuclear secrecy has drawn increasingly tough UN and separate U.S. and European measures.    

The U.S. and Israel have not ruled out using force against Iran if they conclude that diplomacy and sanctions will not stop it from developing a nuclear bomb.

Future: Iran said in January it had produced the first nuclear fuel rod, and it had to find a way to make them because Western sanctions prohibit their purchase from foreign markets

In Washington, no immediate comment was available from the U.S. State Department on the IAEA statement. An IAEA report, published in November, suggested Iran had pursued military nuclear technology.

It helped precipitate the latest rounds of sanctions by the European Union and U.S., which are causing economic hardship in Iran before a parliamentary election in March.

The IAEA visit came as Iran last week announced 'key advancements in its nuclear programme' - inserting the first domestically made fuel rod into a research reactor in Tehran and installing a new generation of Iranian-made centrifuges at the country's main uranium enrichment facility in the central town of Natanz.

America and its allies want Iran to halt uranium enrichment, which they believe could eventually lead to weapons-grade material and the production of nuclear weapons.

Iran has been enriching uranium up to 20 per cent, while uranium enriched to more than 90 per cent can be used for a nuclear warhead.

The IAEA team had wanted to talk to key Iranian scientists suspected of working on an alleged weapons programme.

Iran has denied alleged weapons experiments for nearly four years, saying they are based on 'fabricated documents' provided by a 'few arrogant countries' - a phrase authorities in Iran often use to refer to the US and its western allies.

The IAEA summarised its information last November in a 13-page document drawing on 1,000 pages of intelligence.

It stated then for the first time that some of the alleged experiments can have no other purpose than developing nuclear weapons.

One key finding was information that Iran had built a large containment chamber at Parchin in which to conduct high-explosives tests. The UN agency said there were 'strong indicators of possible weapon development'.

The IAEA said intensive efforts had been made to reach agreement on a document 'facilitating the clarification of unresolved issues' in connection with Iran's nuclear programme.    

'Unfortunately, agreement was not reached on this document,' it said in an unusually blunt statement.

The IAEA mission's lack of progress may have an impact on the chance of any resumption of wider nuclear negotiations between Iran and the six world powers, the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany. 

The West last week expressed some optimism at the prospect of new talks, particularly after Iran sent a letter to EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton promising to bring 'new initiatives', without stating preconditions.     

But the U.S. and its allies may become more reluctant if they feel the Islamic state is unlikely to engage in substantive discussions about its nuclear activities.    

The deputy head of Iran's armed forces was quoted yesterday as saying Iran would take pre-emptive action against its enemies if it felt its national interests were endangered.     

'Our strategy now is that if we feel our enemies want to endanger Iran's national interests, and want to decide to do that, we will act without waiting for their actions,' Mohammad Hejazi told the Fars news agency.

In retaliation for oil sanctions, Iran, the world's fifth-largest crude exporter, has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, conduit for a third of the world's seaborne oil, while the United States signalled it would use force to keep it open.     

The White House has said there was still time for diplomacy.

'Israel and the United States share the same objective, which is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said when asked about a weekend visit to Israel by National Security Advisor Tom Donilon.    

'There is time and space for diplomacy to work, for the effect of sanctions to result in a change of Iranian behaviour.'
