Chelsea's early season form may have led to comparisons with the Arsenal 'Invincibles' side, but Gary Neville believes they aren't even as good as the Chelsea side from 10 years ago.

Jose Mourinho's side are currently four points clear at the top of the Premier League, but after letting leads slip against both Manchester City and United, their killer instinct has been called into question.

'If a team are going to be playing for a 1-0 then you better see it out,' Neville said on Monday Night Football. 'When I saw Jose Mourinho two weeks ago he talked about the 2005 (Chelsea) team and (compared) the team he had then to the team he has now and he said the killer instinct's missing.

Chelsea have dropped more points from winning positions this season than they did in the whole of 2004/05

Chelsea took the lead against both Manchester United and Manchester City, but drew both matches

'When I look at the statistics they are staggering - 28 times they (the 2004/05 team) scored first (in Premier League matches), 27 the season after and they only dropped two and four points (respectively).

'This team this season, even though they're at a really high level, have scored first seven times and already dropped four points. They've got to get to that next level.'

'When (Manchester) City went down to 10 men I thought Chelsea let them off the hook and yesterday at 1-0 up I think Chelsea let United off the hook.

'There's a mentality shift.

The away side had appeared to be in control of the game but were undone with just moments remaining

'At Manchester City they went from 55 per cent possession for the 10 minutes before the goal, and the 10 minutes after they went to 26 per cent possession, and City had 10 men. That can't be an instruction from the manager. That's a shift in the players.

'Yesterday (against Manchester United) they went from 64 per cent (possession before scoring) to 45 per cent (after scoring). They switch off.

'This is not the manager changing it. The players who have worked themselves into a 1-0 lead have then sat deeper.'
