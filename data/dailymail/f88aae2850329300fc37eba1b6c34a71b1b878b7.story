The bosses of a fried chicken shop have been fined after hygiene inspectors discovered their filthy takeaway was littered with mouse droppings.

Droppings were found on dishcloths, work surfaces and shelves throughout the UK Fried Chicken shop, including where food was being prepared.

There was also no soap or hand drying 
facilities at the wash hand basin in the toilet of the takeaway in 
Oldham, Greater Manchester.

Fined: The owners of the takeaway have been ordered to pay a total of £4,550 after admitting five food safety offences at Oldham magistrates' court

A worker from Oldham council’s Environmental Health Team found the premises was infested with mice during a visit to the takeaway in July.

Following an investigation the shop’s owners Ghulam Haider Raja, 34, and Nigat Shaheen, 31, both admitted five food safety offences at Oldham Magistrates’ Court.

The owners, who both live in Bradford, were each fined £1,500 by magistrates and costs of £1,550 were awarded to the council.

Town hall leaders have said the case should act as a warning to other food outlets who fail to clean up their acts.

'Oldham council takes matters like this very seriously and we are committed to ensuring there are no serious lapses in food hygiene in premises across the borough,' said Jean Stretton, Cabinet Member for Co-operatives and Neighbourhoods.

'Business owners who run food establishments must comply with the law or be prepared to face the consequences as we will not hesitate to take action in cases like these to protect the health and safety of residents.'

Attempts to contact the shop’s owners for comment were unsuccessful.
