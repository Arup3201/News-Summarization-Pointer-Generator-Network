McDonald’s is hardly a fine dining experience by candlelight, but three teenagers tried their best to do just that in the fast-food restaurant.

They brought their own cutlery, tablecloth and wine glasses. They set with tea lights as they fed each other french fries, eating their burgers in style.

The boys, 15-year-olds William Peachey, Cameron Ford and Adam Welland,   posted photos on Twitter of their cheeky meal at a McDonald's branch Kingston, south London on Friday which has since been re-tweeted thousands of times.

William tweeted a photograph of the boys eating their McDonald's with wine glasses in hand.

The boys joked: ‘We just thought the place needed a bit of class.’

William told MailOnline: 'We were bored on Friday night and we just thought we should have a nice, formal meal at McDonald's.

'When we first sat down everyone thought it was quite funny, we were getting odd looks from customers and smiles then one employee got a bit annoyed and said "leave or you're banned" but we stood our ground.

'Ninety per cent of the customers and staff loved it. The manager burst out laughing.'

Bring your own: The boys took several photos of their McDonald's experience. One of the boys, Cameron Ford, wrote on Twitter: 'We made a rose substitute'

When approached by a security guard the boys ran out, managing to take their dinnerware with them.

Cameron wrote on Twitter: ‘Who would have thought that classing up McDonalds would have gone so well?

'We made a rose substitute.'

The boys claimed on Twitter that they were banned for their dining antics, but a McDonald's spokesperson said that after some confusion from staff, the boys were told just to make sure they dined responsibly.

A McDonald’s spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the two customers who dined at our Kingston restaurant on Saturday night and are pleased that we were able to offer them an affordable treat.

‘We are happy to provide plastic cutlery
to those customers who request it. We ask that any items brought in by 
customers, such as cups or plates, are used responsibly and taken away 
with them after use.’

Adam tweeted: ‘It was just the standard knives and forks. Clearly we were planning to take over the whole of McDonald’s, so they had to stop that.’

Within hours, the photos had been re-tweeted hundreds of times.

William said: 'It was being re-tweeted about 100 times a minute for two or three hours and everyone was talking about it at school today.'

Not to be deterred, William tweeted: ‘Thinking of an idea for our next escapade, any ideas?’
