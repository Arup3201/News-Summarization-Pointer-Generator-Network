From bright crimson to eye-popping cerise, there are few shades of lipstick that beauty blogger Ambarina Hasan won't try. Now, the blogger has set herself the challenge of wearing a completely new hue everyday for an entire year, and is documenting her make-up challenge on Instagram and her blog, Beauty Passionista.

Ambarina, who is on her 182nd new lipstick said: 'I never thought I get this far, but indeed I have and it's been a pleasure everyday. Yes, there have been days when I didn't really want to put on any make-up, days when the lipstick I chose just didn't look right and days when, gloriously, it all came together.'

The lipstick fan, who also writes for Hello! Pakistan and online magazine Running In Heels added: 'But most of all, each and every day has made me realise how just a slick of lipstick can change your mood.

'A bright lipstick and suddenly, the world seems a little less hostile. People smile as they pass you in the street, ask you what shade you're wearing and new conversations are struck up - all because of a lipstick.'

On her blog this week she wrote on 
her pleasure at hitting the six month mark, saying: 'Can I just take a 
moment here?  26 weeks... That's six months.... half a year... 182 days.

'I never thought I get this far, but indeed I have and it's been a pleasure everyday.

'Yes, there have been days when I 
didn't really want to put on any makeup, days when the lipstick I chose 
just didn't look right and days when, gloriously, it all came together. 
But most of all, each and every day has made me realise how just a slick
of lipstick can change your mood.

'A bright lipstick and suddenly, the world seems a little less hostile.

'People smile as they pass you in the
street, ask you what shade you're wearing and new conversations are 
struck up.  All because of a lipstick. An inconsequential, finger-sized,
bullet-shaped little pack of possibilities.'

Ambarina is six months into her challenge to wear a different colour lipstick every day
