An angelic-looking teenager described as the 'devil child' of his village has been warned he faces jail if he breaches the terms of his second ASBO. 

Blond Matthew Dodd-Flemming, 17, tried to get dogs to bite a newsagent, flashed his bare buttocks to school staff and fired an air rifle through a window in Rhydyfelin, near Pontypridd, South Wales.

The teenager also fought in the street, kicked balls at neighbours' homes, smoked cannabis, drunk alcohol in public, climbed scaffolding and looked into the windows of an old people's home.

Dodd-Flemming has now been given his second ASBO in a bid to prevent him from menacing the village.

The ASBO bans him from climbing onto any scaffolding or roof, throwing stones, eggs or waste, playing ball games in the street, or swearing at passers-by.

David Jones, head of community protection, said: 'We are committed to protecting the community of Rhydyfelin from unacceptable behaviour such as this.

'Dodd-Flemming is an unusual case. He faces immediate arrest and imprisonment if he decides to breach the terms of his ASBO.

'We hope this serves as a reassurance to the community that we are working as hard as we can for as long as it takes to manage an offender who causes such harm to the area in which he lives.' 

One villager said: 'This lad looks like butter wouldn't melt in his mouth with his blonde hair and good looks.

'But he is no cherub in real-life. He is the devil child for many people around here.

'We just hope he starts behaving himself or just get away - either in prison or in any other part of Britain.'

Mr Jones added that Dodd-Flemming had 'expressed an interest in growing up and getting a job'.

'We sincerely hope he takes advantage of the assistance and opportunities that are on offer and moves forward with his ambitions – or he could find himself as the oldest man in Rhydyfelin still on an ASBO in decades to come.'
