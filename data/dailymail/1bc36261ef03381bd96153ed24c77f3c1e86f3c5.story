A 49-year-old man infected with a respiratory virus believed to be more deadly than Sars has died in Britain, officials have revealed.

The Qatari man was being treated for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-nCV) in an intensive care unit at St Thomas’ Hospital in central London. 

Hospital officials said that the man, who was 49 when he was admitted, died after his condition deteriorated.

There have now been 77 confirmed cases across nine countries with 41 deaths from the 
virus, which emerged last year and is similar to those that cause Sars 
and the common cold.

Three people have now died in the UK as a result of the infection.

Before the latest victim became ill he had travelled to Saudi Arabia where the majority of coronavirus cases have been reported.

The patient, who was suffering from acute respiratory syndrome and renal failure, was then admitted to an intensive care unit in Doha, Qatar, on September 7 last year.

The man, who has not been named by officials, was transferred to the UK by air ambulance on September 11.

A hospital spokeswoman said: 'Guy’s and 
St Thomas’ can confirm that the patient with severe respiratory illness 
due to novel coronavirus (MERS-nCV) sadly died on Friday 28 June, after 
his condition deteriorated despite every effort and full supportive 
treatment.'

Despite doctors’ efforts to keep him alive, including connecting him to an artificial lung, he died on Friday last week.

This latest death comes after the World Health Organisation (WHO) said in May that Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus - or MERS-CoV - is a 'threat to the entire world'.

In a statement in May the World Health Organization (WHO) said: 'The 
greatest global concern is about the potential for this new virus to 
spread.

'This is partly because the virus has already caused severe disease in 
multiple countries, although in small numbers, and has persisted in the 
[Middle East] region since 2012.

Most cases of the disease have been recorded in Saudi Arabia, which is also expecting millions of Muslin pilgrims to visit this month during Ramadan

'Of most concern, however, is the fact that the different clusters seen 
in multiple countries increasingly support the hypothesis that when 
there is close contact this novel coronavirus can transmit from person 
to person.'

Experts raised concerns that the disease is 'emerging faster than our understanding'.

WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan said: 'We understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat.'

Cases have been confirmed in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia and the UK.

British health officials have been advised to be vigilant for severe unexplained respiratory illness in anyone who has recently travelled in the Middle East, as well as any unexplained clusters of such illness.

Coronaviruses cause most common colds but can also cause Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome). In 2003, hundreds of people died after a Sars outbreak in Asia.
