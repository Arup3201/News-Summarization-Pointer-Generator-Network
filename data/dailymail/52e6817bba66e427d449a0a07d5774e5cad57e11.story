Dangerous: Casey Dickerson, of Florida, is being held without bail after being accused of raping a 15-year-old girl on a cruise

A 31-year-old married man has been charged after a teenage girl was allegedly gang-raped by him and a group of teenage boys in a cabin of a Carnival cruise ship.

Casey Dickerson was arrested on Sunday after the sexual attack was reported last weekend.

He denies rape but admitted that he had bought alcohol for a group of teenagers on board the cruise which left Florida on August 16 for a four-day trip to the Bahamas. 

Dickerson also admitted to having sex with other women who were not his wife on board the boat.

The girl, who has not been identified, said she was raped in an extra cabin that Dickerson had keys to on board.

He had been given access to a second room by crew after his wife had earlier complained about noise.

The
15-year-old girl told authorities that she went to the cabin with a 
15-year-old friend where Dickerson was partying with four teenage boys.

The girl said they were given alcohol before her friend was held in the bathroom by one of the teenagers while she was raped.

She said that the accused and other attackers took turns holding her down and encouraged each other to 'switch' positions, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

At one point during the prolonged attack, someone came to the door of the cabin. She was held on the floor while one of the teenage boys sent the person away, according to reports.

The girl was dressed and finally allowed to leave the room. She was treated for her injuries at the on board medical center where a rape kit was done. Carnival alerted the FBI to the incident.

It was unclear as to who the 15-year-old girl was traveling with on the cruise liner.

The
boys claimed to FBI investigators that Dickerson told them to have sex with 
the girl. No charges have been brought against them so far and they have
not been named.

Dickerson, from Casselberry, Florida, told WFTV that it was supposed to be a fun vacation for him and his wife, adding: 'The cruise was great itself.'

He claims to have been drunk, passed out and was unaware that anything sexual took place in the cabin.

During the interview, when asked if he had raped the girl, he refused to answer any further questions.

He
is being held on federal charges of sexual assault at Orange County Jail without bail 
after a judge deemed him a danger to the community. There is no federal law for statutory rape at sea.

It is the decision of the 
Attorney-General if sexual assault charges are to be filed against 
juveniles. The agency is investigating the case, a spokesman said.

A
statement from Carnival Cruise Lines reads: 'Carnival is fully 
cooperating with law enforcement officials as the investigation 
continues.'

There have been previous reports of sexual assaults on board Carnival cruise ships.

Last November, a Carnival Cruise Lines employee was accused of sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl who was on holiday with her family.

Kert Clyde Jordan, 35, from Grenada, 
worked as a waiter on the Miami-based Carnival Liberty. He was charged 
with engaging in a sexual act with a person under the age of 16.

He was accused of coaxing the girl into a bathroom on the Lido deck, part of the boat's upper level.

The girl told her parents about the attack after they had returned home from vacation, police said.

At the time, the cruise company said:
‘Carnival has a zero tolerance policy from crime and we take any 
allegations of crime extremely seriously.'

Only ten days prior to this incident on November 4, an Alabama man was sentenced to ten years in prison for raping a 13-year-old girl on-board a Carnival cruise in Mexico.

According to court records, Dylan Cole Bloodsworth, 19, met the girl when she was on a holiday cruise with her family in March 2011.

Bloodsworth talked her into accompanying him to get a jacket from his cabin and raped her, according to court documents.

The Carnival Sensation operates three- and four-day cruises from Port Canaveral to the Bahamas. It has 2,056 passenger capacity and 920 staff. The cruise liner is catered to families with pools, water slides and several kids' clubs. 

Carnival Cruise  Lines is based in 
Miami, and has 23 ships which sail to The Bahamas, Caribbean, Mexican 
Riviera, Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, New England, and Bermuda.
