As smartphones become cheaper and more available, instant messaging is on the rise, while the number of texts sent falls dramatically

OMG! The text message is on its way out a little over 20 years after it arrived to revolutionise how the world communicates.

New and cheaper ‘instant message’ alternatives available from smartphones connected to the web, such as Snapchat and WhatsApp, are taking over.

The first text was sent on December 3, 1992, when British engineer Neil Papworth, 22, used his computer to send the message ‘Merry Christmas’ to a mobile phone.

The number of texts sent in Britain peaked at 39.7billion in 2011, having sparked the new language of text speak, from OMG (Oh My God) to LOL (Laugh Out Loud) and XOXO, meaning hugs and kisses.

However, this year the number is predicted to fall to 21billion, less than half the 50billion ‘instant messages’ that will be sent.

The pattern is being repeated around the world, where the number of texts sent last year is thought to have fallen by seven billion to 145billion.

The beauty of the instant message is that it can be sent cheaply through a smartphone app over the internet, rather than as a phone message via the mobile network, which can cost 15p a time.

Users, so far mainly teenagers, can also communicate with several people simultaneously and punctuate their messages with brightly coloured icons.

Snapchat, which is estimated to be used by up to half of all schoolchildren, allows users to send images, videos or text – known as Snaps – that disappear from the recipient’s phone after a maximum of ten seconds.

But the app has sparked concern over its use by teenagers for sending explicit pictures of themselves, a practice known as sexting.

The figures highlighting the rise of the instant message are included in a study by accountants Deloitte.

A spokesman said: ‘We have reached a tipping point. But the usage of mobile phones to send messages is stronger than ever. This year, trillions of instant messages will be sent in place of a text message.’

According to the telecom prediction survey, the number of texts sent last year fell 7bn to 145bn, while the number of instant messages sent through apps rose to 160bn.

Head of telecoms research at Deloitte, 
Paul Lee, said: 'While text messaging has been growing in volume since it started, it has to come to an end of it's heyday.

The number of SMS messages sent is predicted to make a steady decline, while the number of instant messages sent is set to increase dramatically. Factors are thought to be both financial and generational

'There has been a moderate decline in text volumes for a couple of years, and what's driving it is growth in alternative services like Whatsapp, Snapchat and mobile e-mail.

'This means that there have been declining revenues from text recently, with more people being inclined to take out mobile broadband packages.

'companies losing revenue from falling SMS use will be able to make it up in an increase of broadband packages, and we're predicting that mobile broadband revenue will overtake text revenue  for the first time.'

Experts say the reason for this is costs. Texts cost 10p to send, with a bit less to deliver, and IM apps like Whatsapp are free for the time being.

Lee said: 'Quite a few IM services have no profit - many are in a start-up
 phase right now. Whatsapp has 400 million users a month, and charges 60p a year to use it.

'iMessage is free with an iPhone. Snapchat is accumulating 
users rather than charging them, whereas text messaging costs money.

'Some of the companies charge for things 
like emoticons and games, they're diversifying significantly, but they're still looking at ways to generate revenue.'

SMS still makes up around 98 per cent of revenue for mobile phone companies, because everybody still uses it across the world.

'I think it'll continue to exist because for now its the common denominator in all mobile phones' Lee said.

'Unless something else 
comes up that takes over as the common denominator then its safe - if you want to get a message to someone you have to use SMS.

The report predicts that in 2014 the number of texts sent will fall even further to only 140bn, while the number of instant messages will increase dramatically to around 300bn.

Whatsapp (left), which was released in 2009, has since overtaken SMS as the predominant form of messaging in the UK, and iMessage (right), which was released on the Apple iPhone in 2007, was one of the first most readily available IM services, following on from Blackberry's BBM

It
 is thought that younger users are turning away from traditional texting
 in favour of instant messaging services that offer lower prices and 
more customisation.

In
 addition, the cheapness and availability of smartphone technology is 
contributing towards the rise of IM, with cheaper handsets meaning more 
people who wouldn't usually buy smartphones, like senior citizens, are 
becoming regular users.

The price of the technology also 
means that soon mobile phone companies will stop making traditional 
handsets, and people will have no choice but to convert to smartphones. 

In
 the UK the percentage of people over 55 with a smartphone was 29 per 
cent in 2012, and is set to rise to around 47 per cent in 2014.

However, only 13 per cent of older smartphone owners used IM, preferring to use their smartphones to make calls and send texts.

Suggestions show that it could be a generation gap that makes the difference. Paul Lee said: 'IM is a tremendous utility for delivering messages for nothing.

'For young people its phenomenal, because it's free and they have devices to utilise this. For older its irrelevant.'

SMS is still worth 
around £60bn, because of its functionality; Texts still work in any 
country, on any network, on any handset.

Traditional SMS still stands to make more money in 2014 than IM, and the report predicts that this trend will continue until 2018.

BlackBerry
 can claim to have started the IM trend when its BBM service started in 
2006, but the IM trend took off when the iPhone was released in 2007.

This
 release brought with it services like iMessage, Facebook Messenger and 
Whatsapp, released in 2009, with these services overtaking traditional 
texts in the UK last year.

A
 Carphone Warehouse spokesperson said: 'With the massive increase in 
popularity of instant messaging apps, it’s not surprising that the 
number of texts sent has fallen so dramatically.

'Consumers
 are no longer tied to text messages or phone calls as a means of 
communication and are using free messaging services like Whatsapp, 
iMessage, Facebook and Skype instead.

'We’ve
 seen significant change across our stores as customers are more 
interested in enquiring about a tariff’s data limits - and whether a 
phone comes with a free messaging app or function pre-installed - as 
opposed to the number of text messages and minutes available.
