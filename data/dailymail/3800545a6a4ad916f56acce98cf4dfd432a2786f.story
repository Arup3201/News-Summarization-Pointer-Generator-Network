Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour has declined an invite to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's wedding - just weeks after controversially putting them on the cover of the fashion bible.

Ms Wintour HAS received an invitation to the exclusive affair, with Entertainment Tonight today reporting there will be a dinner in Paris on May 23 before guests are flown to the wedding in Florence in Italy on May 24.

A source close to the editor confirmed she would not be attending. However, she is believed to be in talks to feature their wedding pictures in an upcoming issue.

A source told MailOnline: 'Anna politely declined Kim and Kanye's kind invitation.'

The trio remain close and Kim and Kanye joined Ms Wintour at the Met Gala in New York last week.

When asked about the wedding photos being featured in Vogue, a Vogue spokeswoman said: 'We never comment on future issues'.

Kim and Kanye appeared on the April cover of Vogue, shot by legendary Annie Leibovitz.

Standing in a strapless Lanvin gown, Kim looked the blushing bride with her Lorraine Schwartz engagement ring, valued at over $ 5million, as Kanye stood with his arms wrapped around her. The hashtag #worldsmosttalkedaboutcouple was emblazoned beneath them on the cover.

The cover led to around 250,000 sales - about 20 percent more from the previous issue featuring Rihanna.

The wedding of the reality star and the rapper is said to be so intimate
 that even Keeping up with the Kardashians executive producer and family
 friend Ryan Seacrest did not score an invite.

Speaking
 on Monday at the FOX Upfronts in New York, American Idol star Seacrest,
 39, told Access Hollywood: 'Here's what I would guess. It would be one 
of the most amazing ceremonies that has ever been had.

'I think that we'll all sort of smile and love that fact that you can see how much he adores her and she adores him.'

And
 Kim, 33, who will be on her third marriage, told Seacrest on his KISS FM
 radio show in February: 'We're having a super, super small, intimate 
wedding. As we go along, we're realizing we want it to be smaller and 
more intimate than people are imagining and thinking.'

The invitations, revealed last week, 
feature a simple design: gold lettering on a neutral background. 
Information is scarce; all that's included are a few lines about the 
date and dress code for the ceremony and rehearsal dinner.

The
 bride-to-be, who today was on her way to New York for the E! Upfronts 
with her sister Khloe, recently tweeted about the upcoming event, noting
 that the 
vows would not be filmed for her E! reality show, but 'everything 
leading up til and after' would be. 'We've decided to keep this close to
 our heart and share thru photos,' she wrote.

Friendship: Anna Wintour has forged a close friendship with rapper Kanye and reality star Kim - defending her decision to put them on the April cover of Vogue

For months it was rumored that music millionaire Kanye had been 'begging' Ms WIntour to put his fiancée on the cover of Vogue.

But Ms Wintour put those rumors to rest in her April 2014 Editor's Letter for Vogue's Shape Issue, calling the cover shot: 'both charming and touching'.'You may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancée on 
Vogue’s cover,' wrote the 64-year-old Editor In Chief. 'He did nothing of the sort. The gossip might make better 
reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn’t true.'

Ms Wintour applauded Kim's 'strength of character', writing: 'There’s barely a strand of the modern 
media that the Kardashian Wests haven’t been able to master, and for 
good reason.

'Kanye is an amazing performer and cultural provocateur, 
while Kim, through her strength of character, has created a place for 
herself in the glare of the world’s spotlight, and it takes real guts to
 do that.'

This is such a dream come true!!! Thank you @VogueMagazine for this cover! O M GGGGGG!!! I can't even breath [sic]!' Kim tweeted when the cover was released on Vogue's website 

Ms Wintour, who has been editing the magazine since 1988 says a long held tradition of Vogue is 'being able to feature those who define the culture at 
any given moment, who stir things up, whose presence in the world shapes
 the way it looks and influences the way we see it.

'I think we can all 
agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by Kim and 
Kanye to a T. (Or perhaps that should be to a K?),' she writes with tongue in cheek.

Rumors that Kim may have secured herself a spot on Vogue's cover went into overdrive in June last year after the couple was spotted dining at Ms Wintour's West Village home in Manhattan. Four months later, in October 2013, the couple announced their engagement.

Then in early February it was widely reported that Kanye wanted Ms Wintour to put his fiancée on Vogue's cover wearing a wedding dress by Valentine’s Day, in order to 'present his lady love with the ultimate gift!'

While sartorially speaking those rumors were spot on, Ms Wintour emphasized in her Editor's Letter that 'It was, I should add, entirely our idea to do it'.

Meanwhile, Kim was so overwhelmed, she tweeted: 'This
 is such a dream come true!!! Thank you @VogueMagazine for this cover! O
 M GGGGGG!!! I can't even breath [sic]!'
