There have been 50 online bomb threats made since January 17 when a social media post led to a plane being evacuated in North Carolina, a US official claimed.

CNN reports that an unnamed official blamed the publicity surrounding the earlier incident for spawning copycat threats, as airlines have seen the number of threats increase sharply. 

'We are continuing to investigate these threats with our law enforcement and airline partners as we do with all stated threats,' an FBI spokesman told the network.

'Threats of this nature can and do result in costly responses from a multitude of law enforcement and airport entities and greatly inconvenience travelers. Individuals responsible can be prosecuted federally,' the official added.

WRAL reports that a January 17 Delta flight out of Atlanta was grounded at Raleigh-Durham due to a social media threat.

Passengers were ordered to leave their luggage and exit out the back of the plane before being detained several hours in airline authority offices.

On January 24, a post on Twitter against two flights was deemed credible enough that two F-16 fighter jets were scrambled to escort the planes into Atlanta.

Southwest Airlines Flight 2492 from Milwaukee and Delta Air Lines Flight 1156 from Portland both landed safely at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. 

Once on the ground, the planes were searched by bomb-disposal units, which gave the all clear, according to airline officials.

Explosive-detecting dogs sniffed luggage and authorities questioned passengers from the flight before they were allowed to leave.

FBI special agent in charge Britt Johnson told WSB-TV the Joint Terrorism Task Force is currently investigating, though the agency has not yet labeled the incident an act of terrorism.

'Typically on these things, there's a trail. Whether you want it to or not, you leave a trail,' said Johnson.
