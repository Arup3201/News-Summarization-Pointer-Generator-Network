An armed robber repeatedly slapped a
 31-year-old woman in the face with his genitals after she refused to 
give him money in a bizarre home invasion yesterday morning.

The woman was asleep when two thieves knocked on the back door of the Northwest 18th Avenue, Miami home and forced their way in after her father-in-law answered.

The masked burglars demanded the man hand over his cash, but when he said he had none, they kicked in the door to the woman's bedroom about 3am.

Miami New Times reported one of the robbers pointed a gun at the woman's head and verbally abused her before walloping her face with his privates.

'The suspect placed the firearm 
to the [daughter-in-law]'s head and stated 'B****, where is the money?'' the police report states.

'Victim stated she didn't have any money. 
Suspect then pulled down victim's shirt and removed his penis from his 
pants and began hitting the victim in her face with his penis stating 
again 'B**** give me the money'.'

When the sexual assault victim again replied 'I don't have no money', the robbers stole two television sets valued at $600 and fled, according to the Miami Herald.

The woman told police she 
believed the gunmen had seen her take money out from a bank the night before and had followed her home.

Police are searching for the robbers.
