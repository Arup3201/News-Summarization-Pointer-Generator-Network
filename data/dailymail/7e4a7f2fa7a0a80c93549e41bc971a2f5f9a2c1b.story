This is the moment a frustrated man snapped - bringing the bloodied corpse of a dead male koala into the offices of his local council.

Darren Mewett, from Thornlands, southeast of Brisbane, decided to take the gruesome stand because he was upset with how council has failed to protect local wildlife from becoming roadkill.

He told local newspaper The Redland City Bulletin no one had addressed his concerns when he previously reported a koala fatality.

'This time, I decided to take the koala in to council because no action was taken the last time I reported a dead koala and my comments were not taken seriously,' Mr Mewett told the paper.

He's had enough: Redland resident Darren Mewett stormed into his local council offices wielding a bloodied dead male koala.

Donned in workwear, Mr Mewett stormed into the council chamber holding the koala in his right hand.

In he goes: Mr Mewett enters the Redland City Council building.

'This council operates under a fallacy, spruiking there are koalas here and they are protected but it is all just talk.'

After storming into the offices, Mr Mewett stood patiently in the customer service queue alongside other local residents.

Councillor Lance Hewlett, the local government's environment spokesman, told Daily Mail Australia many staff found the display over the top.

'It was quite confronting, I think, for some of the customer service staff,' he said.

A council spokesman said it has had 'ongoing discussions' with Mr Mewett about his road safety concerns.

Signs have been erected warning motorists of wildlife in the past. The spokesman said council will investigate if further action should be taken.

Redland is part of the so-called 'Koala Coast' which includes the Moreton Bay Regional Council and Redland City Council areas.

More than 1300 koalas are estimated to live in Redland, according to council figures released last year. That makes it one of the biggest urban koala populations in Australia.

Fellow locals appear unimpressed at Mr Mewett for his stunt.
