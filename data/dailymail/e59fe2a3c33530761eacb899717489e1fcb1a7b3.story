A teenage chef who claims she suffered sexual discrimination at a celebrity-owned restaurant turned up to work in 'skimpy tops and hot pants', a tribunal heard today.

Chloe Maisey, 19, who has made 21 allegations against the all-male staff at the Hardwick restaurant in Abergavenny, also used 'sexually provocative' language at work, it was claimed.

Miss Maisey worked at the restaurant - which is owned by Gordon Ramsey's best man Stephen Terry - as trainee pastry chef for three months, but claims she was ogled at every day as she got changed into her chef's whites.

But on the third day of the employment tribunal in Cardiff, staff members told how Miss Maisey, of Pontyclun, south Wales, turned up to work in 'skimpy tops and hot pants' which were 'inappropriate' for the workplace.

Sous chef Jamie O’Leary, 32, said: 'I didn’t find her clothes fit for the workplace. I thought some of the clothes she showed up in were inappropriate for work.'

William Rees, who is representing Miss Maisey, suggested to Mr O'Leary that staff had sexually discriminated the chef because they thought she was 'cheap'.

But Mr O’Leary replied: 'My wife wears skimpy tops and hot pants and I don’t think she is cheap - but she doesn’t wear them to work.'

The tribunal also heard how Miss Maisey was 'not shy' about showing off her tattoos and piercings.

Miss Maisey, who is pregnant, has a tattoo of a laced 
stocking top with an antique pistol tucked into it around the top of her 
right thigh, the hearing was told.

Former chef Andrew Fellowes said: 'She would show people her tattoos and show off her piercings.'She instigated that. I didn’t care about piercings and tattoos - I came to work to cook.

'I suppose you do judge someone if they dress like that for work but it still didn’t affect the way I treated her at work.'

But Miss Maisey also claims she was 'groped' by a member of staff who slapped her bottom. She said her colleagues often teased her about her breasts.

She claims she was targetted because she was the only girl in the kitchen.

Yesterday's hearing also heard how the young chef was shut in a freezer one day at work, leaving her 'scared and upset'.

The trainee pastry chef, who worked at the restaurant for three months, wore 'skimpy tops and hot pants' to work, which some described in the tribunal as 'inappropriate'

Staff also put salt and pepper in her hair and earwigs in her saucepan to scare her, the tribunal was told.

But Mr Terry, 47, who trained under Marco Pierre White and often features on cooking programmes, told the tribunal that some of the incidents never happened and dismissed the others as 'banter'.

He said: 'Doing service is very stressful and there is a little bit of banter.

'You are in an environment where people mess about on occasions, but the guys are not malicious in any way. It is not that she was singled out because of her sex.'

He denied being involved in any of the play himself saying 'I am above that'.

The
 tribunal also heard on previous days how the vegetarian teenager was tricked into eating
 beef stock by a colleague who told her it was chocolate sauce.

Mr Terry, who owns the restaurant, said he considered some of the behaviour towards Miss Maisey as 'banter'

Mr Terry - who was awarded a Michelin star at the age of 25 - did not deny the incident happened, but told the tribunal he took vegetarians 'very seriously'.

He also said he was 'shocked to the core' when Miss Maisey’s mother rang him to complain about her daughter’s treatment.

But Mr Rees told Mr Terry he had failed to investigate the allegations formally and took the word of his male employees after one conversation.

Mr Terry, who denies the allegations, said he trusted his senior chefs who had worked for him over a number of years.

There were also allegations from Miss Maisie that Mr O'Leary threw a sea bass at her.

Mr O'Leary, told the tribunal: 'Have you any idea how much sea bass costs?'

'If Stephen Terry caught wind of me throwing a sea bass around the kitchen it would be the end of me.'

The tribunal continues.
