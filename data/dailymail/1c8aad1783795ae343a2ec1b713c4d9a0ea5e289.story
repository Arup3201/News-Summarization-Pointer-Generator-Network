Shocking details of the unpublished report into electoral fraud in Labour's Falkirk constituency have been revealed, showing evidence of forgery, coercion, trickery and manipulation.

The Unite union has been accused of trying to fix the selection of the Labour candidate in the party's safe seat and Ed Miliband ordered an enquiry into goings-on, only to abandon the inquiry and refuse to publish what was discovered.

However, extracts from the report are contained in a Unite document compiled to reject the accusations against the union.

A report by Unite on Labour's investigation into alleged vote rigging by Unite members has revealed details of alleged fraud. Ed Miliband, pictured on the Andrew Marr Show last week, ordered the investigation but refuses to publish the findings

It says Labour's probe found evidence that signatures and documents were forged, new recruits pressured to join Labour and even tricked into signing up.

There is also evidence that membership fees were paid by a third party.

Published in today's Sunday Times, the report states: 'It is not unusual for complaints to be made about all aspects of the selection procedure but these complaints are of particular concern because of the number of members involved.

'There is a line to be drawn between recruting members who support the aims of the party and the recruitment of large numbers of paper members who have no wish to participate except at the behest of others in an attempt to manipulate the party.'

The report also states that there are concerns over 112 applications or direct debit forms, and 14 show evidence of being paid for by someone other than the person named, a violation of party rules.

Unite's document denies all the allegations outlined and today it released a rebuttal of the claims made in The Sunday Times, claiming their responses to questions sent to them by the newspaper were ignored.

It said: 'This report is a rehash of issues already investigated by Police Scotland and the Labour party, both of which found that Unite had done nothing wrong, and had broken neither the law nor the party’s rule book as it stood at the time.

'Specifically, Unite entirely denies any involvement in or knowledge of the forging of signatures on application forms or of any documents whatsoever; the coercing of individuals to join the Labour party – however that might be accomplished; the recruitment of individuals to the party without their knowledge or any other breach of Labour party rules.

'Unite called for an independent public enquiry into what happened in Falkirk, and we remain entirely happy to assist such an inquiry – and draw appropriate lessons from it if necessary – should one be established.

'Some of the questions submitted, however, appear to relate to conduct by third parties, about which Unite cannot comment.

'Unite would also point out that once individuals join the Labour party they can involve themselves as much or as little in the party’s business as they choose, but Unite would certainly encourage any of its members to play as full a part in the party’s life as they can.'

Today the Mail on Sunday reported Tom
Watson is at the centre of Labour’s vote-rigging row in Falkirk after 
one of the candidates for the seat directly accused him of trying to fix
the selection.

Gregor 
Poynton, a Blairite communications expert, said Ed Miliband’s former 
campaigns chief had used his power in the party to try  to install his 
union-backed office assistant as the candidate.

Mr Poynton also claimed that Mr Watson had been involved in ‘all the shenanigans’, including trying to pack the Falkirk party with members of the Unite union to win selection for his assistant, Karie Murphy. He also alleged that the party leadership ‘knew what was going on’.

It is the first time Mr Watson, who stepped down from his frontbench role in the wake of the row, has been publicly accused by another party figure of trying to influence the selection process.

Mr Watson did not respond to messages but has previously denied any wrongdoing or involvement in the alleged ‘fix’ of the selection process in Falkirk.

The explosive claims come just days before the contest to succeed Eric Joyce, who quit the party after a Commons bar brawl, is reopened in the Scottish seat.

Labour suspended the selection in May after The Mail on Sunday revealed it was investigating allegations of vote-rigging by Unite and had referred the matter to the police.

Ms Murphy and the local party chairman, Stephen Deans, were also suspended - triggering a knock-on threat of industrial action by Unite at the nearby Grangemouth petrochemical plant, where Mr Deans is a union convener.

Mr Miliband dropped the investigation in September after key witnesses withdrew their testimony. Mr Poynton, the UK political director of communications firm Blue State Digital, made his remarks at a party fundraising dinner last week.

He described an atmosphere of ‘serious intimidation’ during the selection process - claiming he and fellow candidates had ‘all been taken out in one way or another’.

He told how Mr Watson had tried to help Ms Murphy by ‘packing’ the local party with Unite members, ‘getting them put on the membership list... they had a spreadsheet of names and a cheque, and he phoned up party office and said you need to accept this’.

He described the reaction of Labour HQ as ‘it’s a bit dodgy... not sure about this’, adding about Mr Watson: ‘He was involved in it all behind the scenes... all the shenanigans, pushing things through’.

But Mr Poynton said that when the party leadership uncovered the allegations it tried to broker a deal with Unite for Ms Murphy to quietly stand down: ‘The party came to a deal... we’re not going to investigate this stuff that’s gone on, we know what’s all gone on, but you have to pull out of the selection,’ adding: ‘Their preference was, we know it’s all happened but it’s better for everyone if you just pull out.’

Shortly before the process was suspended, Mr Poynton was eliminated from contention when an all-female shortlist was imposed.

Mr Poynton, who is married to West Dunbartonshire Labour MP Gemma Doyle, said he still had not ruled out being selected when the process is reopened. The allegations follow the leak of emails last week which appeared to show Unite officials were involved in a bid to undermine Labour’s inquiry.

Unite dismissed the suggestion and said neither the law nor party rules had been broken in the selection process.

Last night, a senior party source said: ‘We have acted swiftly and decisively throughout the process, and the candidate at the centre of the issue has now withdrawn.’

Mr Poynton did not comment.
