Zenit St Petersburg took a giant stride towards the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday night after overcoming 10-man Torino in the first leg of their round of 16 tie.

Axel Witsel and Domenico Criscito were on target for Andre Villas-Boas' side at the Stadion Petrovskij as Marco Benassi was dismissed in the first half for the visitors.

Zenit have not progressed beyond this stage of a European competition since they won the UEFA Cup back in 2008 but will be clear favourites heading to Turin next week for the second leg.

The Russians returned from a two-and-a-half month break in competitive football at the end of February and came into Thursday's match with three straight wins without conceding a goal.

Zenit controlled the early exchanges, dominating possession as Torino defended deep. The Italian's already difficult task became harder when, on just 28 minutes Benassi walked.

The midfielder was cautioned as early as the 12th minute when he pulled back Hulk as the Brazilian attempted to spring a counter-attack, before naively challenging Witsel to earn a second booking.

The hosts eventually took the lead in the 38th minute. Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel pounced inside the penalty area when Torino failed to clear after Daniele Padelli could only parry an Igor Smolnikov effort.

Salomon Rondon thought he had doubled the advantage before the break when he turned Witsel's pass into the net, but it was correctly ruled out for offside.

After the restart Hulk should have increased the lead. After a neat one-two with Danny the former Porto forward fired a tame effort that was easily kept out by Padelli.

But Zenit were soon celebrating again as Italian left back Criscito turned home the rebound after Hulk had struck the post.
