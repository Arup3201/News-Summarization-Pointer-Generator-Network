The Roman city of Pompeii has been drawing visitors eager to get a glimpse of everyday life almost 2,000 years ago ever since it was discovered.

And now a well-preserved Roman funerary complex has been unearthed 40miles (70km) northeast of Venice.

It is the largest ancient necropolis found in Italy since the 19th century and, like Pompeii, was  preserved by a natural disaster.

The Roman colony of Iulia Concordia was discovered 70km northeast of Venice.

It's the largest ancient funerary complex found in Italy since the 19th century.

Like Pompeii, the complex was destroyed by a natural disaster.

It was hit by floods that covered it in sediment and rubbish in the fifth century AD.

Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a necropolis from the first century BC and a later podium with two elegant sarcophagi on top of it.

The ancient colony is nearby the modern town Concordia Sagittaria in Gruaro, Veneto.

Pompeii was buried by the volcanic 
eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, whereas the Roman colony of Iulia 
Concordia was hit by floods that covered it in sediment and rubbish in 
the fifth century AD, according to reports by ANSA Med.

The buried site has been likened to a ‘little flood-plain Pompeii’ and tours are being conducted of the site as it is excavated.

The flood-preserved sarcophagi in the Roman colony, have lain invisible and inaccessible for 1,500 years.

So far, the remains of a necropolis from the first century BC has been found, as well as a later podium measuring just under 7ft (2m) tall and 20ft (6m) long, with two elegant sarcophagi on top.

Two more tombs were found nearby and another at the base of the monument.

The colony is situated near the modern town Concordia Sagittaria in Gruaro, Veneto and a large monument from the third century AD can be found outside its ancient walls.

So far, the remains of a necropolis from the first century BC has been found, as well as a later podium measuring just under 7ft (2m) tall and 20ft (6m) metres long, with two elegant sarcophagi on top. Roman sarcophagi vary in style. This particularly elaborate example is the first century sarcophagus of a young girl

Excavations of the site are underway, financed by the Region of Veneto with the help of EU funding.

The Italian government has freed up €2million (£1.66million) of funds to save the massive archaeological site of Pompeii, after several walls have been washed away as the result of heavy rain and important structures including the Temple of Venus were damaged.

As well as being one of the world’s most famous archaeological sites, Pompeii is an important tourist attraction near Naples and draws around two-and-a-half million tourists to the area every year.

Both the United Nations and the European Union had demanded urgent action to save the famous site from further damage, the BBC reported.

It is believed that the UN has already made substantial funds available for routine restoration work, but the money seems to have been tied up in bureaucracy and Italy’s government has come under fire for neglecting and underfunding the site for years.

Italy’s Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi has asked local businesses to chip in to help save the Unesco Heritage site and private businesses have already been called upon to help fund restoration work for the Colosseum in Rome.

The Italian government has freed up two million euros of funds to save the massive archaeological site of Pompeii, after several walls have been washed away. It has come under fire over the years for neglecting and underfunding the site (a house is pictured) which attracts around 2.5million tourists a year
