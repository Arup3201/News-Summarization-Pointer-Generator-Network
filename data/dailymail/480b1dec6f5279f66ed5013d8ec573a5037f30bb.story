Phone hacking and other illegal information gathering was mostly committed on behalf of law firms, telecom companies and insurers – not by journalists, it has emerged.

The Serious Organised Crime Agency knew that businesses other than journalists hired criminals to access people’s voicemails six years ago, but did nothing to intervene, according to a report by the agency.

One of the main ‘hackers’ involved in the practice said 80 per cent of companies hiring criminals to hack phones were law firms, wealthy individuals and insurance companies, according to the report.

One of the individuals was ‘a celebrity who broadcasts to millions every week’.

Just 20 per cent of hackers’ clients were in the media – which came under fierce scrutiny from the Leveson inquiry, costing taxpayers £6million.

The other corrupt practices mentioned in the report included live phone interceptions, police corruption, computer hacking and perverting the course of justice.

SOCA’s findings were privately presented to the Leveson inquiry in 2012, but the report was not made public or included in the Leveson Report. Labour MP Tom Watson said: ‘What is astonishing about this whole murky affair is that SOCA had knowledge of massive illegal invasions of privacy in the newspaper industry – but also in the supply chains of so-called blue-chip companies.

He said: ‘I believe they are sitting on physical evidence that has still not been disclosed fully to forensic investigators at the Metropolitan Police. The law should also be rigorously applied to other sectors that have got away with it.’

Police investigations reviewed by SOCA found that 20 per cent of calls in the reports were being listened to by private detectives in real time.

The report, seen by The Independent newspaper, said a ‘telephone interception specialist manufactured several devices which were physically attached to the target’s landline at the relevant signal box by a British Telecom-trained telecommunications engineer’.

A document entitled The Blagger’s Manual was unearthed by another police inquiry. It gave advice on accessing personal details held by companies, banks, HM Revenue and Customs, councils, utility providers and the NHS.

An extract said: ‘It is probably a good idea to overcome any moral hang-ups you might have about “snooping” or “dishonesty”. The fact is that through learning acts of technical deception, you will be performing a task which is not only of value to us or our client, but to industry as a whole.’

The source who was aware of the report, codenamed Project Riverside said clients who hired illegal private investigators included a major telecoms company, a celebrity broadcaster, a media personality and a businessman negotiating a £500million takeover. But the most prolific clients were law firms, particularly those involved in lucrative marriage and fraud litigation.

The criminals, who were paid as much as £14,000 to hack phones and track bank transactions, were found to be ‘developing and cultivating useful relationships’ through ‘socialising with law enforcement personnel’.

Despite the trade in criminality identified in the report, which dates back to 2006, none of the offenders hired to perform the illegal snooping was charged with criminal offences until after the phone hacking scandal.

Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘I am deeply concerned about these revelations. I will be seeking an explanation from SOCA as to why this was not told to the committee when we took evidence from them about the issue of private investigators.

‘It is important we establish how widespread this practice was and why no action was taken to stop what amounted to criminal activity.’

A SOCA spokesman told The Independent: ‘SOCA produced a confidential report in 2008 on the issue of licensing the private investigation industry. This report remains confidential and SOCA does not comment on leaked documents.’
