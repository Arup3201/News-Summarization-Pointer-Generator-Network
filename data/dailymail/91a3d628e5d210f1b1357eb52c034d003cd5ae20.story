The 57-year-old was found dead at a townhouse on the Gold Coast, reportedly tied to a chair at a Mulgrave Crescent address in Varsity Lakes  at 11.40am on Thursday.

The residence has been declared a crime scene with forensic and scientific officers continuing their examination of the scene.

Police are appealing for public assistance to speak with anyone who had contact with Hudson since he arrived on the Gold Coast on Monday, October 20.

Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson, Regional Crime Coordinator said: 'Mr Hudson arrived on the Gold Coast from Sydney on Monday and we would like to hear from anyone who has spoken to him or seen him since he got here.'

While police are questioning a female sex worker after Hudson's body was found naked by his flatmate, understood to be a woman, according to Gold Coast Bulletin.
