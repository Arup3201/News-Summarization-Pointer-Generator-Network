Vladimer Putin took back control of Russia’s nuclear button yesterday after returning as president amid a fresh wave of arrests of his political enemies.

Two days of violent and ugly scenes on the streets of Moscow marred his carefully-choreographed inauguration at the Kremlin.

Controversial former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi, who has become a close friend of Mr Putin’s in the past decade, was guest of honour at the opulent ceremony which included a lavish banquet for 3,000 VIPs at which sturgeon steak and smoked cod were washed down with vodka and 5,000 bottles of sparkling wine.

But after some 556 arrests on Sunday and yesterday, the man thrashed in March’s presidential election, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, warned Mr Putin that it was ‘extremely dangerous’ to ‘shut people’s mouths with the help of a police baton’.

As protests continued in the lead up to Putin's inauguration this morning, the Russian leader said serving his country is the 'meaning of his life'

A security blanket was thrown over 
central Moscow as Mr Putin drove to the Kremlin through eerily deserted 
streets from the office of the prime minister, which he has occupied for
four years, to resume as president, a post he held from 2000 to 2008.

After taking the oath of office he 
kissed his wife Lyudmila then left the podium swaggering like a 
Hollywood star along a red carpet.

The man Mr Putin replaced as 
president, Dmitry Medvedev, will take over as premier in a job swap 
arrangement that has infuriated political opponents.

They claim that both parliamentary and presidential elections were rigged.

Despite this, it is clear 59-year-old
Mr Putin retains majority support in Russia. His term expires in 2018 
and he can stand for a further six years.
The president is expected to shake up the Russian government as he seeks to restore his country’s superpower status.

The president is now expected to stage
a huge shake-up of the Russian government as he seeks to restore his 
country to the status of superpower that it held in the Cold War.

'The world has seen Russia reborn, and
this is the result of the efforts of our people - shared, intensive 
work in which everyone has made a personal contribution,' he told 3,000 
VIP guests in the Kremlin.

'I will do all I can to justify the 
faith of millions of our citizens. I consider it to be the meaning of my
whole life and my obligation to serve my fatherland and our people.

'We will achieve our goals if we are a
single, united people - if we hold our fatherland dear, strengthen 
Russian democracy, constitutional rights and freedoms.'

He stressed: 'We want to live and we 
will live in a democratic country where everyone has the freedom and 
opportunity to apply their talent and labour, their energy

'We want to live and we will live in a
successful Russia, which is respected in the world as a reliable, open,
honest and predictable partner.'

After about an hour of tense 
confrontation on Sunday, police had began pushing protesters back toward
the square and harshly detained some of them.

Chaos: Violence erupted between 20,000 demonstrators and riot police Moscow on the eve of Vladimir Putin's inauguration as president last night

Violence: Club-wielding officers wearing helmets seized demonstrators and hauled them to police vehicles

'Riots': More than 400 people were arrested as there were reports people were dragged by the hair and neck on Sunday night

Police then detained protesters who 
had remained peacefully on the square. Two of the opposition leaders 
were dragged away while addressing the crowd and the third before he 
could take the stage.

The ground was left littered with 
broken glass and splattered with blood. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry 
Peskov, defended the police action.

'I would have liked them to be tougher,' he said on the Dozhd cable television channel.

Before the march turned violent, some of the demonstrators acknowledged that Putin's March election win was a blow to morale.

'It's true that some have been 
disappointed,' said Yuri Baranov, a 46-year-old information technology 
specialist. But 'the most important thing is that people have awakened.'
