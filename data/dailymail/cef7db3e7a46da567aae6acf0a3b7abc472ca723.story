A Queensland police officer catches the slimiest of crooks, but it is not the kind you think. 

One of North Tamborine Sergeant Mick Jones' latest captures was a 1.5-metre carpet snake that made a meal out of a young family's pet guinea pig named Fluffy Wuffy.

The officer was called to the family's house at Mount Tamborine on Sunday to find the reptile bulging from swallowing its prey inside the pet's hutch in the backyard.

North Tamborine Sergeant Mick Jones' latest capture was a 1.5-metre carpet snake that made a meal out of a young family's pet guinea pig

'It’s quite a regular occurrence every summer. Where a guinea pig used to be, there was a snake,' Sgt Jones told Daily Mail Australia.

'The gap that it goes through when it is skinny is too small, once they have that big lump they have got to wait.'

When the warmer months come along, Sgt Jones and his colleagues are not only police officers but snake catchers as well.

He said they got calls at least three times a week to capture or rescue animals in the North Tamborine region.

The death of the guinea pig followed that one of a cat's, which met the same fate as its fellow mammal

Sgt Jones said he was called to another home at Mount Tamborine on Monday at 6.30am, where the residence's owner had snapped a photo of a cat's tail sticking out of a python's mouth

'Nine out of 10 times it's a chicken, budgerigars or cockatiels,' Sgt Jones said. 

The death of the guinea pig followed that one of a cat's, which met the same fate as its fellow mammal.

Sgt Jones said he was called to another home at Mount Tamborine on Monday at 6.30am, where the residence's owner had snapped a photo of a cat's tail sticking out of a python's mouth.

'It was a feral cat I hope, judging by its tail. Cats are very hard to catch. It was probably a kitten,' he said.

'By the time I got there it was well and truly swallowed. 

'The people who rang it in said it [the cat] wasn't theirs and they didn't think people around there owned it.'

But Sgt Jones is no stranger to animals having lived in Karumba in far north Queensland 

Sgt Jones said it would have taken only a matter of minutes from the time the homeowner took the photo to his arrival for the cat to disappear completely, down the python's throat.

'When [the owner] only came out, there was only the bit of the arse left.'

Snakes have even been found in the backyard of one of his own colleagues.

He shared a photo of a snake sitting in the colleague's chook pen after eating a chicken's eggs.

But it was still hungry as the snake is seen waiting patiently for the animal to get off more eggs she was sitting on so it could eat those as well. Sgt Jones said it was taken away before it could do that.

Several months earlier, the sergeant had to pull another carpet snake from a drain pipe barely a kilometre away from the station on Main Street.

The policeman has been stationed in North Tamborine for nine years and snake catching comes part of the job often

But the policeman is no stranger to catching dangerous animals, having been stationed in Karumba in Queensland's Gulf region.

Though not many people would consider crocodile trapping as part of an officer's job description, Sgt Jones said he had to catch a fair few during his six-year stint up in the state's far-north. 

He helped keepers at Australia Zoo catch one of the park's main main attractions, Digger, in 2005.

'The croc was 14 feet [4.2 metres] and we worked together with the Australia Zoo guys,' Sgt Jones said.

'We caught him within in an hour.

'He was harassing kids on the boat ramp so he had to be relocated.

'He was caught on Anzac Day so they named him "Digger".'

In 2005, Sgt Jones helped Australia Zoo staff capture Digger in Karumba in far-north Queensland

Digger was at that point, 4.2 metres long and was terrorising children on the boat ramp

Sgt Jones said it was a joint effort between police and zoo keepers, taking about an hour
