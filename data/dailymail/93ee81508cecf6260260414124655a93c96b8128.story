Forget air guitar - the World Air Sex Championships which have gone down a storm in the U.S. are on their way to the UK.

The salacious sport, which makes even Miley Cyrus twerking look tame, sees contestants romp their way through the show simulating sex in front of a live audience.

To impress the judges, eager men or women have to act out a full sexual experience with an invisible partner that is part-romance and part-comedy to a soundtrack of their choosing.

Rules: Contestants must romp their way through the show simulating sex in front of a live audience

The act must include meeting their 'partner', seduction, foreplay and intercourse.

Chris Trew, founder of the Air Sex World Championship, said: 'Imagine something we think about every day - sex - turned into a sport where the goal is to make people laugh.

'Air Sex is a party. Air Sex is an amazing comedy show. Air Sex is a sport where you are invested in the outcome.'

First invented in a Tokyo karaoke bar by a group of single Japanese men in 2006, comedian Chris, 32, saw a clip online and thought he'd sex up the air guitar contests he'd been holding.

And in 2009, the official Air Sex World Championship was born. Five competitions later, over a third of competitors are women, with contests held in 30 American cities before an overall champion is crowned.

The only rules are dictated by the state where each competition is held, though participants are warned not to get completely naked and, as with the on-stage lovemaking, all 'endings' must also be simulated.

The sport has even penetrated popular culture, with Chris appearing on America's Got Talent in 2012. But the act ended prematurely with Judge Howard Stern branding his seductive moves 'highly offensive'.

Unsatisfied with humping their way across America, and with a documentary about the sport in the works, Chris is aiming to make the Air Sex World Championship a truly global affair starting with the UK.

He added: 'Every single person from the UK who has seen the show tells me it would be amazing over there.

'I think it will vibe well with the comedic sensibilities as well - it really needs to happen as soon as possible.

'Sex is a big part of life and framing it in a way that allows us to laugh at it is a very powerful thing.

'The bottom line is the Air Sex Championships is hilarious and you want to witness it.'

Contests are held in over 40 American cities with over a third of the competitors being women
