The temptation is to believe that Diego Costa can be rebuilt and will run out at Old Trafford on Sunday in a Chelsea shirt.

Time is tight, just like Costa’s hamstrings, but the reality is that he will miss the biggest match of the season so far.

On Tuesday night, as Chelsea cantered to victory in this Champions League clash with Maribor, they lost Loic Remy after just 13 minutes at Stamford Bridge. His groin is done. He could also be out.

In his place came Didier Drogba, given an uproarious reception by the 40,000 Chelsea fans who turned out to watch this Group G clash against the kings of Slovenian football. They have been dethroned.

The serious business is Sunday, when Jose Mourinho must pick a team to protect Chelsea’s unbeaten record in the Barclays Premier League.

‘I have forbidden the doctor from calling me on my day off,’ claimed Mourinho. ‘I will worry about Manchester United on Thursday.

‘We don’t cry about injuries, it just represents an opportunity for another player. I don’t like to speak about injured players.

‘It's our philosophy, we don't cry. In this moment we have some problems with players who are not available to play. 

‘We will prepare the game Thursday, Friday, Saturday to try to be at our best possible level against an opponent which we respect very, very much.’  

Loic Remy scores the opening goal for Chelsea in their 6-0 victory against NK Maribor on Tuesday

Last season, when they travelled to United for David Moyes’ first home game in charge of the champions, he played without a striker. This time, now that Chelsea are playing football on the front foot and battering everything in sight, he will travel to Old Trafford in search of goals. This team knows no other way.

Now that Drogba has his first goal back in English football after galavanting around the world, first with Shanghai Shenhua and then with Galatasary, he could get the nod. Without Costa, spending his days on the treatment table, or Remy there are no realistic alternatives.

Drogba offers experience and confidence. When Chelsea were awarded a 23rd minute penalty, Drogba asked Eden Hazard if he could take it

‘If you want me to be honest I don’t like it and when they do something like that they have to score,’ added Mourinho.

He did score, as everyone knew he would, by sending Maribor keeper Jasmin Handanovic the wrong way. It was good to see him back on the scoresheet.

‘If the coach wants me I am available,’ admitted Drogba. ‘It was good for my confidence to score, but I am happy because we share the goals around in this team.

‘We have a lot of young players in the team, but we have more quality than we had the last time I was here.’ 

Drogba was down to play 30 minutes against Maribor, but he ended up on the pitch for a lot longer after Remy pulled up after just 13 minutes. It is possible the Chelsea legend could start at United now.

Those legs are still willing, even at the age of 36, but it is a big call for Mourinho to make now.

Costa is the joint leading goalscorer (with Sergio Aguero) in the Premier League and his presence in the Chelsea side on Sunday would shake that United defence. Under van Gaal they are a vulnerable bunch.

Still, at least Chelsea can look elsewhere for goals. Eden Hazard, at the heart of everything Chelsea do well, scored twice as they crushed the spirits of this Maribor side with a thumping 6-0 win.

By then, Drogba was blowing hard, but there is still an aura about one of the best strikers in Chelsea’s history.

On Sunday, there will be a chance to create some more.
