The main representative body of British Jews has called Wigan chairman Dave Whelan's comments 'outrageous' and labelled his apology as 'half-hearted'.

Whelan is set to face a Football Association charge after he responded to the controversy over Wigan's appointment of Malky Mackay as manager by telling the Guardian: 'I think Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else.'

The Wigan owner has since apologised for any offence caused but is facing a critical situation at the club. One of the Latics' shirt sponsors, kitchen firm Premier Range, announced it was breaking ties with the club due to Whelan's appointment of Mackay, who is himself the subject of an FA investigation for sending allegedly racist text messages to Iain Moody, his former head of recruitment at Cardiff.

Dave Whelan has left a Jewish body 'outraged' following his comments in aftermath of Malky Mackay hiring

The Board of Deputies of British Jews vice-president Jonathan Arkush said in a statement: "Dave Whelan's comments about Jews are outrageous and offensive, and bring the club and the game into disrepute.

'His half-hearted apology does not go far enough. You cannot insult a whole group of people, and then say, "I would never insult them", and hope that's OK.

'We need to see a proper apology and full recognition of the offence caused. Whelan, in his role as chair of a football club, has a responsibility to set the tone for both his players and supporters. 

Mackay was appointed Wigan boss this week, despite the text and email scandal

'Racism and anti-Semitism will prevail on and off the pitch if it's acceptable and unchallenged in the boardroom.

'We will be taking up the matter with the Football Association and Kick It Out.'
