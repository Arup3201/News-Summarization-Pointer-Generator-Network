A widow whose husband was shot dead by her pastor lover has admitted to plotting the murder.

Teresa Stone, 40, will be sentenced in June after pleading guilty on Monday to conspiracy to commit murder in the March 2010 death of Randy Stone of Independence, Missouri.

Prosecutors say she conspired with her minister, David Love, who is serving a life prison sentence after admitting last year that he shot Randy Stone to death.

Love was accused of shooting Mr Stone, a 42-year-old insurance agent, outside his office on March 31, 2010.

Once the pastor of New Hope Baptist Church in Independence, where the Stones were parishioners.

In a self-help manual, Mr Stone listed Love as the most influential person in his life, and he sometimes attended weekly counselling sessions with him.

Mr Stone was active at the church and Love gave his eulogy, saying: 'We sit here and we weep not just because of the separation from our loved one, but because of all the questions that death brings, questions like "Why? Why him? Why now?",' according to a report early this year in The Kansas City Star.

'Without answers, death seems so cold,' Love said.

Love moved to South Carolina not long 
after Mr Stone's death and was arrested there in November 2010 after a 
Jackson County grand jury indicted him on charges of first-degree murder
and armed criminal action.

He accepted his life sentence in 
November after pleading guilty to a lesser charge of second-degree 
murder and armed criminal action.

During the proceeding Monday in 
Jackson County Court, Teresa Stone didn't offer any explanations for the
slaying but grew emotional when she admitted, while answering questions
from her lawyer, that she helped plan her husband's murder.

Dedicated: The Stones were both members of New Hope Baptist Church in Independence, Missouri, where David Love was pastor

Randy Stone's mother, Clara Koehler, said later that watching Stone admit her role was difficult.

'It was hard, a whole lot harder than 
it was with David (Love), but that's probably because Teresa was my 
daughter-in-law,' she said.

Randy and Teresa Stone had two children and had been married 20 years at the time of his death.

Family members believe Stone's husband did not know of her alleged affair with Love, which they say went on for about a decade.
