A mother whose 11-year-old son sneaked aboard a passenger jet then flew to Rome alone is furious after three airline staff were told they would all keep their jobs.

Liam Corcoran jumped on a plane at Manchester Airport and travelled over 1,000 miles without a passport, cash or boarding pass.

Three Jet2.com workers were suspended in the wake of the incident, and warned they could be dismissed while the airline reviewed procedures at all their British airports.

But today it emerged the staff members had been told they will not lose their jobs and are back at work after being retrained.

Rome alone: Liam managed to get on to the plane even though he had no passport or boarding pass

Liam’s mother Mary Corcoran, 30, said: 'I’m disgusted with Jet2. Three months on and I have not even had so much as an apology. I still haven’t had a letter, any correspondence or anything. 

'That would have been the bare minimum that I would have expected after my son got half way to Rome before anyone realised.

'It’s a disgrace that these people can be reinstated after what happened and that’s what I find hard to understand - this was a vulnerable child who was by himself.

She added: 'I knew that the staff were being investigated and I was hoping that the outcome would be that someone would be held accountable and sacked for it.

'At the end of the day they let a child who was alone get through all the security and on to a flight heading to Rome.

'It’s a disgrace and I’m very angry that the staff have not been sacked and have only been re-trained. I think it’s outrageous and I still can’t get my head around it.

'They put my son’s life at risk by not doing their job properly and checking. Alarm bells should have been ringing.

'I really do dread to think what could have happened if he’d got out of Rome airport. I don’t think I would ever have seen him again.'

Liam Corcoran-Fort said he climbed on to the Jet2 plane looking for a toilet after slipping away from his mother near to Manchester Airport

Liam from Newall Green, near Wyhenshawe, Manchester evaded five separate checks to board the plane at Terminal One after giving his mother the slip at a shopping centre near her her home.

He was only noticed by staff after the aircraft had taken off, and he spent two hours in the airport in Rome as the plane's crew were quizzed by Italian authorities.

Liam was brought back on the return flight and reunited with his mother.

Mrs Corcoran added: 'Thousands of people pass through that airport and I thought that it was meant to be one of the top ones for security, especially because the Olympics were approaching and security was meant to have been upped.

'They could have let anyone through.

'They should have done a head check when people boarded the plane but that never happened. I’m glad that this procedure will be put back in place but it does not excuse what happened and that is what failed Liam.

'I’ve still not had any answers about how he ended up on the plane before he was spotted. I’d like to ask them how he got through without a passport and boarding pass.'

She added: 'Thankfully I got my son back but it could have been much worse and I’d hate to think that it could happen to another child, especially if these people are still employed.

Liam on a less jet-setting holiday: As a toddler riding on a donkey in Blackpool

'Liam could have got all the way to Rome and I dread to think what could have happened, he could have ended up dead.

'He got through five security checks and when he got to the one where the body scanner is they just told him to put his hands out and he said they said "off you go". It’s unbelievable.

'He was not stopped by anyone official and there must have been hundreds of people passing through who were going on their holidays who didn’t stop him.'

As part of its review Jet2.com reinstated a headcount of passengers on every flight after it emerged that crews did not routinely carry out the check and concluded that this was the main reason why Liam was not spotted sooner.

The practice is not legally required by the Civil Aviation Authority - whose rules state the final check can be cabin crew checking boarding cards as passengers get on the plane from a walkway.

A spokesman for Jet2.com said the incident had been ‘thoroughly investigated' and all staff involved had been retrained and were still employed by the airline.

He added: 'Following a full and thorough investigation, revised procedures have been implemented.

'Head counts are now in place across each of our flights from all airports, including those where airbridges are in use, and additional staff training has been carried out across the business.

'We continue to liaise closely with Manchester Airport regarding security processes.'

Aviation security expert Chris Yates said: 'The fact that the Department for Transport has not come forward with an investigation would suggest that the actions taken by Jet2.com are proportionate given the risk involved.'
