A fired employee is suing an exclusive British-run private school in Manhattan, claiming she was treated differently because she is American.

Sarah Bottoms, 49, who worked at the World Class Learning Academy in the East Village until late last year, says the British staff were offered better perks, that bosses wanted to 'get rid of the Americans' and talked about sex at work.

The Brooklyn mother filed a suit in Manhattan civil court claiming national-origin, sex and age discrimination, as reported by the New York Post.

Bottoms claims that school chiefs John
and Dawn Taylor 'gave British employees greater allowances for time 
off, raises, excusal from student supervisory duties and subsidized 
lunches.'

The former admissions officer says in the lawsuit that these benefits were not available to American staff.

Bottoms worked at the school, where annual fees can rise to $34,000, for three years but lost her job in December.

She alleges that at last year's Christmas Party Ms Taylor said to some fellow Brits: 'We need to get rid of the Americans.'

Bottoms
also claims that Dawn often discussed sex in the office. The suit 
states that Dawn told Bottoms on more than one occasion that men 
preferred Asian woman because 'their sexual organs were smaller.'

Unfair: Bottoms claims that she was fired when she took her grievances to HR

According to court documents, the American woman also claims that Ms Taylor criticized her personally, telling her off for wearing pant suits and asking her to use lipstick because 'thatâ€™s how an admissions director should dress.'

Bottoms claims that when she took her grievances to the school's HR department she was fired.

'World Class Learning takes this very, very seriously, and will conduct a very thorough investigation and take appropriate action,' school lawyer Ben Fryer told the Post.
