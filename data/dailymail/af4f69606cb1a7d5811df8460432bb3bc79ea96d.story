Cheated justice: John William Good has been jailed for 12 years

A rapist who cheated justice for nearly 25 years has been jailed because of advances in DNA profiling.

John William Good, 54, attacked a nurse in the early hours of July 5 1987, forcing her into a car at knifepoint as she walked along Hillingdon Road in Uxbridge, west London.

She was driven to a nearby multi-storey car park where Good raped her.

He then drove her to a closed garage forecourt and raped her a second time.

The woman reported the incident to police and an investigation was launched but no suspect was identified at that time.

A Metropolitan Police cold case review in 2011 established the availability of samples which could be tested further after advances in forensics.

A DNA sample was identified and highlighted a potential match to Good.

He was arrested in July last year then charged with kidnap and two counts of rape.

Yesterday he was jailed for 12 years at the Old Bailey.

Detective Sergeant Andy Beete said: 'The Met's Sapphire cold case team is committed to pursuing rapists and sexual offenders, regardless of the time which has passed since the offences were committed.'

He encouraged any victims of rape or serious sexual assault to speak to the authorities.

New evidence: Teams at Scotland Yard were responsible for unearthing the new DNA clues
