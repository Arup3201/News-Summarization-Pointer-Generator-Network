Revealed: Edward Snowden has leaked documents which say the NSA are creating a computer that could break the world's strongest encryption tools

The National Security Agency plans to create a quantum computer that could break the strongest encryption tools in the world, according to documents leaked by Edward Snowden.

The former NSA contractor-turned whistleblower has provided documents which suggest that the NSA is on a code-breaking mission which could have revolutionary consequences for almost every type of encryption which protects records used by governments, banks and hospitals.

The NSA plans to build a ‘cryptologically useful quantum computer’ as part of its $79.7 million research project, ‘Penetrating Hard Targets,’ through various classified contracts at a College Park laboratory in Maryland, according to the Washington Post.

The leaked internal NSA document said: ‘The application of quantum technologies to encryption algorithms threatens to dramatically impact the U.S. government's ability to both protect its communications and eavesdrop on the communications of foreign governments.’

The computer, which would be exponentially faster than a traditional computer, would be able to complete tasks in seconds whereas normal computers would usually take years to solve.

Comparing NSA’s progress - which is kept top secret - to the best civilian labs has long been attempted by computer scientists and physicists.

It seems the agency is keen to keep up with quantum computing labs sponsored by the Swiss government and the European Union, who have made impressive progress in the last decade, striding ahead of American efforts.

One leaked NSA document said: ‘The geographic scope has narrowed from a global effort to a discrete focus on the European Union and Switzerland.'

In their bid to keep their progress 
secret, the NSA conducts some of its research in ‘Faraday cages,’ metallic
 structures which stop the entry or escape of electromagnetic energy to 
‘keep delicate quantum computing experiments running,’ according to a 
NSA document.

In theory, a quantum computer can solve 
problems much faster than a classic computer, which is only capable of 
doing one calculation at a time. A quantum computer is able to avoid some calculations which are deemed unnecessary to solve the problem, 
making the process substantially more efficient.

A working quantum computer would be capable of breaking a standard known as RSA which works to encrypt messages making it unreadable without a shared password. It is used most commonly by secure financial institutions, website browsers and in encrypted emails.

Recently Google bought a quantum computer called D-Wave Two which can perform tasks 3,600 times faster than normal computers. The company is hoping to use it to find cures for diseases, fix climate problems and help robots better understand human speech, for example. 

The company is hoping to unlock the power of the computer, which was built by Canadian company D-Wave, at the new Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, housed at NASA's Ames Research Center in California.
