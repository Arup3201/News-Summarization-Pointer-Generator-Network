A dying two-year-old's last Christmas wish has come true as her community worked together to transform her house into a winter wonderland.

Calianna Griggs's family wanted to stage an early Christmas for the toddler, who may not make it to December.

She was diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome and adrenocortical carcinoma in April and despite chemotherapy and multiple surgeries, doctors say she has just a month to live.

But on Thursday, thanks to dozens of volunteers and donations from the community - Cali got her dying wish.

Cali Griggs, two, got her Christmas wish as volunteers transformed her house into a wonderland

Gifts: Santa, elves and even Minnie Mouse was on hand to ensure Cali's final Christmas is special

She and her parents were picked up by Santa Claus in a horse-drawn carriage down the street from their home.

When it came around the corner, she saw her home transformed.

Part of the wonderland featured a tent with Minnie Mouse, Cali's favourite character, and gifts for the toddler. 

Her father Greg Griggs told AZ Central: 'She just wanted to get out and play with everything. 

'And I had to fight it, I was about to cry.'

Volunteers filled the yard with decorations and blanketed the house with lights - which will stay up for the entire holiday season.

The local fire department and J Barry Designs spent house making snow that covered the lawn - and despite it taking all day, it was worth it when Cali enjoyed a snowball fight with her father.

Hugs: The transformation was possible after thousands of dollars were raised in donations

A couple of weeks ago, Cali's family said her doctor gave her one to three months to live and desperate for her not to miss Christmas, they said they planned to stage it early. 

The genetic syndrome she has, which affects fewer than 500 people in the world, has created the rare cancer and given her more than 30 tumors on her lungs, one on her adrenal gland, another in her belly and one on her spine.

Despite undergoing intense chemotherapy twice and multiple surgeries, doctors at the hospital in West Valley, Arizona, have told her parents, childhood sweethearts Greg and Ashley Gonzalez, that she has between one and three months left.

'Calianna is our precious little angel, she is so sweet and deserves a chance to be with us a little longer,' her mother said. 

Tragic: Calianna Griggs, aged two, has been given one month to live after contracting adrenal gland cancer

Last wish: Her parents Greg Griggs and Ashley Gonzalez hope to make her last Christmas the most special

Diagnosed: This is Cali in the early stage of her cancer last spring went she grew three dress sizes in 10 days

But Mr Griggs added that it is unlikely she will live out the full three months: 'We want her last Christmas to be the best and we also want for her funeral service to be very special.'

Mr Griggswas tearful as he told MailOnline: 'She is in a world of pain that I couldn't even imagine.

'It is just getting harder and harder and harder.'

The couple noticed something was wrong when Cali ballooned from aged two clothes to aged five clothes in just 10 days.

She is now continuing to swell up and is becoming increasingly lethargic. 

In a recent local TV interview, Mr Griggs broke down in tears as he could hear the microphone picking up Cali struggling to breathe.

'It was just too much. She finds it so difficult. Sometimes now she just sleeps for hours at a time.' 

Fun: Cali loves dressing up but she is finding it harder to breathe and play as her cancer gets worse

Her mother updated family and friends on their GoFundMe page: 'She is so swollen now and her tummy is as hard as a rock. But the saddest part is she is struggling to breathe now.  

'I am scared to fall asleep every night because I'm afraid she will stop breathing in the middle of the night.' 

Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a disorder that affects a handful of people worldwide.

It stems from mutations of either the TP53 gene or CHEK2 gene, which normally act as tumor suppressors by controlling the growth and division of cells.

When mutated, it allows cells to multiply, grow and divide in and out-of-control nature, making sufferers more susceptible to cancer, especially leukaemia, brain and breast cancer.

In many cases, one of the sufferer's relatives will have had a cancer that displays similar characteristics.

Cali's LFS prompted adrenocortical carcinoma, a rare cancer that forms in the outer layer of tissue of the adrenal gland.

The gland is a small organ on top of each kidney that makes steroid hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline to control heart rate, blood pressure and other body functions. 

The disease, which affects up to just two million people a year, has a five-year survival rate of 20-35 per cent. 

Symptoms include hair growth, weight gain, a lump in the stomach or back of the head, muscle weakness and high blood pressure.

Fundraising: They have set up a GoFundMe site to prepare for the funeral and the family's early Christmas
