Since stepping down as foreign secretary, he has lost the use of his grace and favour mansion.

But now William Hague has bought his own £2.5million country pad with a striking resemblance to his former official residence, Chevening.

The ex-Tory leader and his wife Ffion have purchased the 10-bedroom Welsh property ahead of his retirement from Parliament at the general election.

William Hague and his wife Ffion have bought £2.5million Cyfronydd Hall, a 10-bedroom house in Wales

The 10-bedroom stately home in Powys, Wales, is set in nearly 13 acres of grounds.

It has 10 bathrooms and three reception rooms, along with a 'leisure suite' featuring a heated indoor pool, spa pool and fitness suite.

The property, built in 1865, also has a library, cellars, an orangery and six one-bed and two-bed holiday cottages.

'We have had our eyes on Cyfronydd Hall for some time,' Mr Hague told the local County Times newspaper.

'Ffion and I are looking forward to having a home in Wales for the first time and to living in such a beautiful part of the country.'

The sprawling property sits in 12 acres of rolling green hills and boasts an indoor swimming pool and jacuzzi for the couple to enjoy in retirement

The Cabinet minister, who has previously penned biographies of William Pitt the Younger and William Wilberforce, said it was 'an ideal place to write books'.

Mr Hague already has a £1million apartment in a stately home in his Richmond, North Yorkshire, constituency.

He said he and his wife would still keep a home in Yorkshire 'to keep in touch with old friends' but they were looking forward to moving to Mid Wales very soon.

Mr Hague, who is currently First Secretary of State and Leader of the House of Commons, stepped down after five years as foreign secretary in July and announced his intention to retire from politics.

The 53-year-old met his wife while he was Welsh Secretary in the 1990s and she worked in his private office.

Mrs Hague currently makes television programmes for Welsh-language broadcaster S4C.

In his role as foreign secretary, he had access to Chevening, a £15million mansion in Kent.

The 115-room property set in 3,500 acres of land had been the official country retreat of the foreign secretary for decades, but Mr Hague had to share it with Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister.

Mr Hague also lived in a grace and favour luxury apartment at One Carlton Garden in London near Pall Mall.

Cyfronydd Hall was profiled by Country Life when it went on the market with a guide price of £2.5million in 2013.

The magazine said the former girls' school has 'spectacular panoramic views over the rolling countryside of the majestic Banwy valley' from its large sash windows.

It continued: 'An intimate study overlooks the rear garden, with its towering beeches, oaks and cedars.

'The first floor houses the splendid master suite and five further bedrooms, which all have luxurious bathrooms.

'Four more bedrooms and bathrooms, each with its own quirky, individual character, are located on the floor above.'

Glyn Davies, the Tory MP for Montgomeryshire, said he was 'really pleased' the Hagues had decided to move to his constituency.

'Ffion's father was a Montgomeryshire man so she has family roots here, and William is hugely popular throughout Wales. I believe they will feel very much at home.' 

He was expected to complete the purchase of Cyfronydd Hall today.

William Hague, a former Conservative leader, is thought to have amassed more than £4.8million from public speaking, two books, a newspaper column for the Daily Telegraph and various business advisory roles.

His after-dinner circuits provide him with £25,000 a speech. 

His book contacts - he has previously penned biographies of William Pitt the Younger and William Wilberforce - along with his other assets are valued at £1.5million. 

He also has a £1million apartment in a stately home in his Richmond, North Yorkshire, constituency.

Mr Hague holds various business advisory roles. He is a Patron of the European Youth Parliament UK and Vice President of the Friends of the British Library.
