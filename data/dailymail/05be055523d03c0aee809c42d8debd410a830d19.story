A town clerk used a council credit card to pay to watch gay porn online and then altered the records to say he had been buying 'festive lighting', a court heard.

Roy Hunt, 70, also bought petrol and two laptops at the taxpayers' expense before his scam was uncovered.

Hunt was sacked by Dronfield Town Council in Derbyshire, but escaped with a suspended jail sentence.

Scam: Roy Hunt, 70, paid for gay porn as well as two laptops and petrol using a council credit card. He escaped jail after being found guilty of theft and fraud

He had denied 11 charges of theft and fraud but was convicted following a trial at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court.

Mike Treharne, prosecuting, said Hunt had falsified accounts by disguising purchases in the council records.

Mr Treharne said: 'He entered festive lighting in the records while paying to go online to a gay porn site.

'He did downloads from the PlayStation
 website and purchased two laptops, entering them on records as fine 
mesh metals and an item from Screwfix Direct.

'These were false entries in the 
account book in his own handwriting. He suggested it happened because of
 incompetence but he was found guilty on the basis of dishonesty.'

Deputy District Judge Lawrence gave him a one-year prison sentence suspended for two years.

He said he would have imposed an immediate term of imprisonment but for Hunt’s health problems, which included lung disease.

The offences were committed between March 2009 and August 2010, the court was told.

Hunt’s actions came to light after 
items on a credit card statement found among planning documents aroused 
the suspicions of colleagues. He was on holiday at the time.

Hunt, from Swallownest, Sheffield, was ordered to pay £750 compensation to Dronfield Town Council, along with £960 trial costs.

He also received a 7pm to 7am curfew for six months.The trial was told he had already repaid the council £616.

Hunt claimed the laptops, together 
costing £750, were purchased for work use and denied accessing porn 
websites, claiming the credit card must have been cloned.
