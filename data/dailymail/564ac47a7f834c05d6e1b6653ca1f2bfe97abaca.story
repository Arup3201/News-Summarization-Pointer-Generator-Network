Fall out: Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary and the party¿s chief election strategist has been accused of being 'impossible' to work with

Labour appeared to be in a state of civil war last night as senior figures sought to blame each other for its tumbling poll ratings.

Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s chief election strategist has been accused of being ‘impossible’ to work with.

And it is claimed he has fallen out with Labour’s so-called enforcer, the shadow minister Michael Dugher and Ed Balls, the shadow Chancellor.

The split comes as one poll showed Labour’s lead over the Conservatives has been squeezed to one point.

Mr Dugher is said to have threatened to quit over the ‘safety first’ approach favoured by Labour leader Ed Miliband, which relies on Ukip votes drifting to the Tories, and warned he was being ‘shut out’ by Mr Alexander.

He is understood to have told Mr Miliband: ‘Douglas is totally bloody impossible. Everybody says it. You have got to do something about him.’

Mr Balls is believed to have snubbed Mr Alexander at a crisis meeting chaired by the Labour leader, who insiders said was too weak to intervene.

Meanwhile the party’s election guru - Arnie Graf, who mentored Barack Obama, was also said to have been sacked and sent back to the US - although Mr Alexander insisted he was still working for Labour.

Yesterday, Mr Alexander denied claims of a feud in Labour’s high command. He insisted that Mr Graf was ‘absolutely’ still a part of the election campaign team.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘I don’t think it’s a great headline for the newspapers saying ‘Labour team united and working for a victory’ so I think we can dismiss some of the headlines.

‘One of the insights of this generation of Labour leaders is that it’s a totally false choice to be credible or radical. If you’re not credible then people won’t trust you with the governance of the country. If you’re not radical people just say you’re all the same.

That’s why I believe that we will offer credible and radical policies.’

But one influential commentator with strong links to the Labour party yesterday laid bare the five factions of Labour.

Andrew Rawnsley, the New Labour biographer and Observer columnist, revealed the party was divided into the following groups:

The exposure of Labour’s factions came as an Observer poll yesterday showed Labour’s lead being cut to just one point, with a backing of 33%, down two points from a fortnight ago. The poll showed the Tories on 32 per cent, up two points.

But a YouGov poll for The Sunday Times suggested Labour had a seven-point advantage over the Tories. The survey put Labour on 40 per cent, with the Conservatives on 33 per cent.

Thirty five per centers v Majoritarians: Those who believed they could win the election on just 35 per cent of the vote by keeping their core vote happy and counting on defections from the Tories to Ukip, against those who believe the party has to aim higher to have any authority.

Transformers v Realists: The former group wants Labour to take greater risks and offer a bolder alternative, the latter fear the electorate would not trust this.

Ed v Ed; The tensions between leader Ed Miliband and shadow Chancellor Ed Balls came dangerously close to spilling out into the open when Mr Balls admitted that his boss messed up his response to the Budget because he had been looking at Twitter coverage too closely.

Gloomsters v Zennists: Some inside Labour believe the party’s lead is evaporating as the cost of living crisis argument is failing to take hold and will reverse by the time of the election. But the optimists believe that the post-Budget bounce for the Tories is just the party winning back older supporters from Ukip.
