Murdered: Juliana Redding, 21, had just posed for Maxim magazine and was preparing for her acting career to skyrocket in 2008

Jurors in Los Angeles heard this week how a beautiful 21-year-old model and actress discovered strangled in her Santa Monica apartment battled for her life.

Juliana Redding was found dead in March 2008 and prosecutors believe she was killed by Kelly Soo Park, described as the 'James Bond' style enforcer of a shady doctor who has since fled the United States.

Redding's mother broke down in tears as Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy Okun-Wiese showed jurors photographs of Redding's body taken after her death.

'Juliana Redding spent the last moments of her life literally fighting to save herself,' Okun-Wiese told the jury. 'Juliana Redding tried to fight off a woman. A woman she did not know.... A woman who needs to be held accountable for her actions.'

The first officer on the scene also described the gruesome scene inside the apartment where prosecutors believe Park stangled Redding with her bare hands - then turned on the gas stove and lit candles, hoping to cause an explosion.

Park, 47, is alleged to have worked as an enforcer for a Dr. Munir Uwaydah and the physician dated Redding, a cover girl for Maxim magazine, for a time.

During that time, Uwaydah attempted to go into business with her father, Greg, an Arizona pharmacist.

However, Greg Redding began his own background check into the doctor and discovered that Uwaydah was lying about his age, was married and had a family.

On learning this, Juliana ended their affair her father also stopped the business venture he planned with Uwaydah.

Greg Redding sent Uwaydah a letter on March 10th ending their business relationship - five days before his daughter was killed.

Prosecutors said that Uwaydah made six-figure payments to Park and her family before the killing and before Park's arrest.

They said he had also bragged that he had a 'female James Bond' ready to act.

It took two years to discover a suspect in the murder and investigators linked Park through DNA evidence found on Redding's neck.

However, Park's attorney has questioned the evidence.

'Forensic evidence, the DNA evidence, the fingerprint, are not conclusive. DNA evidence doesn't tell you when it got there or how it got there,' said George Buehler.

The doctor was never charged in the case. He has since moved to Lebanon.

Initial reports at the time described a desperate struggle during which Redding had managed to dial 911 for help when her killer apparently grabbed the phone and hung up.

Prosecutors allege that Uwaydah dispatched Park to Juliana and in turn her father into changing his mind about their planned venture.

While Uwaydah has since left the United States following Redding's death, he has not been charged in the murder.

Prosecutors allege though, that Park had worked as a 'debt collector' for the spinal surgeon and California businessman on at least two occasions.

Park currently remains free on $3.5 million bail

According to documents seen by the Los Angeles Times, Park was officially employed as Uwaydah's real estate broker, but was paid hundreds of thousands of extra dollars to collect debts for him.

The records show that Park received a $250,000 payment from Uwaydah just weeks before Redding was killed

For years, authorities have alleged that Julaiana, who was dated Dr Uwaydah, was murdered after Park was hired by the doctor to intimidate her

Uwaydah now lives in Lebanon and is not sought in connection with the murder of Redding.

A court motion filed last year says that prosecutors are 'not seeking to prove that [Park] murdered Ms. Redding at the direction of Dr. Uwaydah,' only that he told Park to intimidate and threaten the young actress.

Investigators in the case have said 
that Park has been linked to the crime by DNA evidence found on 
Redding's neck, however, defense attorney's argue that the real killer 
is Redding's boyfriend at the time of her death, John Gilmore.

Gilmore
 was cleared as a suspect in the immediate aftermath of the murder, 
insisting that he had several people who could offer him an alibi according to CBS News.

'They're
 trying to point the finger at Gilmore, saying he had, at one time, 
allegedly assaulted his ex-girlfriend,' ABC News legal analyst Dana Cole
 said.

The defense alleges that Gimore's assault of his fiance√© Melissa Ayala casts doubt on the guilt of Park.

They
 allege that Ayala told a defense attorney that Gilmore choked her 
saying, 'that he was going to make her feel what Juliana felt.'

However,
 in a hearing last week Ayala refused to answer any questions, claiming
 her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination as she is facing 
an assault with a deadly weapon charge against Gilmore.
