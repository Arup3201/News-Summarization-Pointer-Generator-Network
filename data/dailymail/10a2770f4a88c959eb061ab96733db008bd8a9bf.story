Authorities have confirmed that the body of Mall of America store manager who has been missing since February and feared murdered by her husband has been found in the Mississippi River.

The body of Kira Trevino was spotted in the river in downtown St Paul by a passerby on Wednesday afternoon, Randy Gustafson from the Ramsey County Sheriff's Office told CBS.

Authorities swarmed the scene and pulled the body from the water, but were not initially certain whether it was a man or woman. They have now confirmed the identity as 30-year-old Kira Trevino.

Mrs Trevino was last seen leaving the Mall of America, where she worked as a store manager of a clothing store, with her husband, Jeffrey, on the night of February 21.

Found: The body of Kira Trevino, 30 (left), has been found in the Mississippi River more than two months after she vanished. Her husband, Jeffrey, (right) has been arrested for allegedly killing her

Problems: The couple had told family members they were having marital problems before she disappeared

Mr Trevino, 39, has since been arrested and charged with his wife's murder after authorities discovered 'copious amounts' of blood throughout their home and on her abandoned car.

Authorities initially focused their search on Keller Lake, which is less than two 
miles from the Trevinos' St Paul residence, after witnesses said they saw two men carrying a body-sized bag there.

Volunteers later came 
across a plastic bag containing a bloody pillow, a bar, shirt and a sponge, and DNA on the items matched that of Kira Trevino.

A hole was also discovered
in the frozen lake, and divers were called in to search an 85-foot 
radius, but nothing was found, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported.

Scene: Her body was found near the Robert Street Bridge in St Paul, Minnesota on Wednesday

Despite the lack of a body, 
authorities felt they had enough evidence to charge Mr Trevino with two 
counts of second-degree murder. He is being held on $1million bail.

After she went missing, security officials at the Mall of
America found the woman's car in a corner of a parking lot. Her purse 
and cell phone were inside, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported.

Trevino's
mother, Marcie Steger, said her daughter’s car was backed into the 
parking space, a maneuver she said her daughter couldn't execute.

The
car was towed to an impound lot, and that is where the tow driver 
spotted what appeared to be blood around the trunk. Police that were 
called to the scene recovered Trevino's stained trunk liner nearby, and 
tests confirmed that it was soaked with human blood.

The
gruesome discovery prompted investigators to search the couple's home 
in the 500 block of East Iowa Avenue in St. Paul just hours later.

Happier times: Mr Trevino had told authorities that his wife was going through a 'mid-life crisis' and ran off

'Evidence': But police found 'copious amounts' of blood at their home as well as bleached clothes and towels

Inside,
officers found several freshly washed towels in a basket next to a 
dryer alongside the Arkansas Razorbacks shirt Jeffrey Trevino said he 
wore on February 21 when his wife went missing.

Going
through the house, police also found two bleach-stained towels, a mop, 
bucket and cleaning products. In the master bedroom, detectives came 
across a gory scene, with blood stains around the bed and a large 
human-shaped blood stain on the carpet, according to their report.

In the bedroom, blood was found on the floor, box spring, 
mattress, bed frame, bookshelf, closet door, baseboard trim and the 
wall.

Processing of the 
home found 'evidence of extensive cleanup efforts,' including furniture 
moved to hide evidence, a spray 
bottle of bleach solution and a carpet cleaning machine. A carpet cleaner had what appeared to 
be blood and human tissue inside of it.

Missed: She was last seen leaving her job at the Mall of America, where her car was later found

Troubled: Mr Trevino claimed his wife had gone tanning and then to work out, but she did not go to either

More blood was found throughout the 
house, including in the kitchen, main flood living room, hallways, 
bathroom, stair landing, on the stairs leading down to the basement - revealing evidence of a long and brutal struggle.

According
to the charges against him, Trevino claims that his wife had been 
suffering a mid-life crisis and that she had been leaving their home for
two or three days at a time.

He
also said that he recently learned his wife had been lying about where 
she was staying and it has emerged that family and friends both informed
the police that the couple were having relationship problems.

According to the suspect, he last saw
Kira Trevino at 8.30am Friday before she left for work. She told him 
that she was planning to work out at her gym in New Brighton, squeeze in
a tanning session at a Roseville salon, run some errands and stop in at
work to interview new employees.

Kira did not go make it into work 
that day, however, nor did she arrive to work on Saturday and Trevino 
did not report her missing until 10.30am Sunday - the same day he told 
her family that he could not locate her.

Search: Holes are drilled into the ice on Keller Lake in search of the body of Kira Trevino in March

Support: Cadaver dogs were brought in to help
with the search at the lake, but they turned up nothing

Wading in the water: Divers search a shallow creek near Lake Keller for clues and evidence in the disappearance of Kira Trevino. A bag containing items with her DNA on were later found

Later
that day, Kira Trevino’s mother called police, reporting her concern 
for the safety of her daughter, who recently shared with her that she 
and her husband were having martial problems, and that Mr Trevino was 
'checking into her bank accounts,' the complaint says.

Days later, police in Bloomington recovered video from the Mall of 
America that showed Kira Trevino’s car entering the parking lot Friday 
morning.

The video isn’t clear enough to show who was in the car, but it
shows someone at the back of the vehicle throwing what appears to be a 
trunk liner away from the car.

The person then got into a cab, which had a GPS tracker, and was dropped off near Trevino’s home, the complaint said.

Workplace: Trevino was a manager at Delia's, a clothing store for teenage girls in the Mall of America

Kira Trevino would travel daily from her home in St. Paul to the Mall of America in Bloomington - where her vehicle was found

Kira
Trevino met her husband in Wausau, Wisconsin, where her family is from,
when he was in town working on the construction of a hospital. They 
married about three years ago.

A 'Find Kira Trevino' Facebook page shared the tragic news on Thursday.

'The body found in the Mississippi 
yesterday afternoon is Kira,' a post read. 'Though not released and laid
to rest yet, she will be. It is no longer a question of when and where.

'To all the volunteers who helped us 
search for our lost friend, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. 
Words can not express how much the support has meant to all of us and 
Kira's family.'
