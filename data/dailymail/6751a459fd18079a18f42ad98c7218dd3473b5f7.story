When she was given 12 months to live, Kim Ferguson was not the kind of person who was destined to 'sit at home and die', as she said in her own words.

Instead she decided to make her way through her battle with cancer 'one outfit at a time'.

With the help of her two loving daughters Kim started up an Instagram account to document her outfits, putting her love for fashion and her zest for life on show to inspire herself, and others.

Day one, 364 outfits to go! When Kim Ferguson found out she had cancer, she decided to document her wardrobe choices, one outfit at a time

'For me it was an outlet, because I'd always been into fashion, it was part of my identity,' Kim told Daily Mail Australia 

'I think the cancer takes your identity, it becomes who you are.

'Then you're put into a box by the type of cancer you have, and then you're a terminal patient and you're put into that box.

'I was trying to claim back a bit of my identity,' Kim, from the NSW Central Coast continued.

'Beating cancer one outfit at a time. Prognosis 12 mths to my expiry date. I choose fashion! It may not be brain surgery, but it sure beats chemo!' the bio on her Instagram page @kimlouiseferguson reads.

Now, more than two years on from her 'expiry date' Kim is continuing to document her outfits and put her incredible wardrobe on show alongside her two fashion-forward daughters.

Kim's journey began more than a decade ago when she was diagnosed with colorectal cancer which meant she underwent three 'quite full-on operations'.

Doctors were shocked that someone who lived such a healthy lifestyle - Kim is passionate about yoga, swimming, and has always been a vegetarian and light drinker - could develop such a disease.

A few years after being given the all-clear for the first time, the mother-of-two fell very ill again, forced to leave her job as a high school teacher for the second time.

'It was bowel cancer this time and moved further up into my body, also into my pelvis and cervix,' Kim revealed.

As part of a trial study she underwent chemotherapy and radiation at the same time, because she was deemed strong enough to withstand such strong therapy.

Then a few years later Kim was back in hospital once again and a glimmer of hope was seen by her and her girls.

After trying a strict juice therapy known as the Gerson Protocol in an attempt to get well enough to access treatment in San Diego she was told that she may not need travel, and that what was making her ill was a treatable ulcer.

'We were in absolute shock, the girls were around my hospital bed when they told us it was just an ulcer. We were overjoyed.'

Outfit 154: This was around the point the 57-year-old started her Instagram, as an outlet for herself but which quickly turned into a support network for others

However 24 hours later the Ferguson's' world was turned upside down again when they were told Kim was so unwell that 90 percent of the organs below her waist had to be removed.

'I have no bowel, no bladder, only part of my stomach, I had organs removed I didn't even know I had.'

This was around the point the 57-year-old started her Instagram, as an outlet for herself but which quickly turned into a support network for others.

'I actually started the Instagram about two years ago, I started it the first time I was told I wasn't going to survive,' Kim revealed.

'When they told me that I thought well "what do you do?"

'I met people who had sat at home and died.

'The girls and I were like that's just not going to happen.

Left to right outfits 167 and 168: Although it has been more than 365 days since her initial diagnosis, the central coast woman said for her the days she documents is about when she feels most herself

Making an effort to get up and get dressed even if it just meant walking around the house in her favourite pair of heels for a few hours, Kim was motivated to keep moving.

'I think it's just an amazing way to connect, people talk about bullying but I haven't experienced any of that.

'The thing is about getting up and getting dressed and being happy.

'I guess I just want people to do what makes them happy, everyone has something that makes them happy and I don't want cancer to take that away from them', Kim said.

Outfit 170: When asked what she'll do when she makes it to the final day in her countdown, Kim couldn't contain her excitement.'I'm going to have a party! A big party like fashion week,' she laughed

Although it has been more than 365 days since her initial diagnosis, the central coast woman - who spends much of her time at the beach or in the water - said for her the days she documents is about when she feels most herself.

When asked what she'll do when she makes it to the final day in her countdown, Kim couldn't contain her excitement.

'I'm going to have a party! A big party like fashion week,' she laughed.
