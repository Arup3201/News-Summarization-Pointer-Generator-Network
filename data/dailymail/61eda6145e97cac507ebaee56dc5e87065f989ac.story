England and Wigan Warriors winger Josh Charnley has added to his impressive collection of tattoos by getting a gigantic ram inked on to his chest.

Charnley revealed to his 55,900 Twitter followers that he spent six hours in a Lancashire tattoo parlour on Tuesday.

The 23-year-old, who already had tattoos on both of his arms, helped his side claim second spot in the Super League last season.

Charnley played an important role in Wigan's campaign despite being hampered by injury.

He was part of the England side which were knocked out of the 2014 Four Nations after losing to Australia and eventual winners New Zealand.

Charnley featured in all three of England's games at the tournament - including their 32-26 victory against Samoa.
