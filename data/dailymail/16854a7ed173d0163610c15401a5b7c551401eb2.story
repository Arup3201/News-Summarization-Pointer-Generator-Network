Abducted: Mohammed El Gasim, from Hounslow, west London, was kidnapped by separatist militants in east Ukraine and held hostage for two weeks

A British medical student kidnapped and tortured by pro-Russian rebels in the Ukraine has told of his terrifying ordeal for the first time.

Mohammed El Gasim, 21, was abducted by heavily armed militia in the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic and subjected to daily beatings and forced labour.

He was accused of being a spy and abused by the same Kalashnikov-wielding, drunk rebels accused of shooting down the MH17 plane, which killed all 298 passengers on board last month.

After 15 days of ‘hell’ which he thought would never end, the young student was suddenly released and fled the city without his passport, which had been taken by his captors. With assistance from the British Government, he was helped to safety and arrived back in the UK last week.

Visibly shaken Mr El Gasim, whose body is covered in bruises and cuts, said: ‘I just lived to get through each day. I didn’t understand why it was happening or if it would end.

‘I pleaded with the guards to either kill me or release me. I tried not to think about anything apart from surviving.’

Privately educated Mr El Gasim, of Hounslow, West London, arrived in the city of Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, in November to study to be a surgeon.

The area was then under the control of the Ukrainian government and was a safe place to be.

However, in April this year it fell into the hands of separatists and Mr El Gasim had started to make plans to leave.

But due to the bureaucratic mess created in the wake of the uprising, it had taken longer than expected to sort out the paperwork for him to be able to safely leave Donetsk.

Three weeks ago, the young student was accosted on his way to a shop for not being able to speak Russian and accused of being a spy.

He was attacked and on fighting back, was doused in pepper spray, thrown into the boot of a car and taken to a rebel compound.

Once there, he was subjected to beatings by around 50 rebels, who hit him with their fists, feet and guns.

He was denied food, forced to carry out physical labour, including digging trenches, and subjected to a barrage of racial abuse by the guards, who Mr El Gasim said used him as a ‘plaything’ for their own sordid amusement.

He said: ‘I’d popped out to buy some cigarettes and a drunk Russian man started shouting at me. I understand a bit of the language and he was getting really aggressive because I was speaking in English.

‘Then he hit me, so I hit him back and someone called the self-proclaimed police force who are the rebels. There was about four of them. They started to hit me and started firing bullets around the street. They then sprayed pepper spray in my eyes and threw me in the boot of a car.

‘I just remember lying there in the dark and kicking out at whatever I could, trying to get out.

‘After what seemed like a long time we got to the rebel compound in the grounds of an old university hospital.

‘They all ganged up on me and kept trying to talk to me in Russian. Then the beatings started.

‘They were all kicking me and punching me, I was beaten with their machine guns and pistols. They did this every day, for hours. Most of the rebels were drunk.’

When not being attacked, Mr El Gasim was put in a disused garage, without food or water and with not even a mattress to sleep on.

He said: ‘There was no food for the first week but even if there had been, I wouldn’t have been able to eat anything because of all the bruises I had. I was in too much pain.

‘I was their play thing. Sometimes they’d get bored and make you do sit ups or push ups for their amusement. I just went with it, I wanted to get out of there alive.’

Meanwhile back in Britain, his distraught parents had learnt of their eldest son’s disappearance and were doing everything they could to secure his release.

Unbeknownst to Mr El Gasim, the rebels had placed his passport on the body of two dead Ukrainian soldiers and accused him of being a spy.

His parents, property developer Salah, 53, and medical interpreter Honaida, 42, who have three other children, refused to believe their son was dead and kept up the pressure on the Foreign Office and hit back at the claims made by rebels online and in the Russian media.

This international pressure did start to filter through and after a week, Mr El Gasim’s treatment became moderately better.

He was still forced to carry out physical labour, but was no longer beaten on a daily basis.

‘After the first week I was told I was being held for hooliganism,’ he added. ‘They told me they’d let me go after 15 days, which in the end they did.’

Lies: A blog written by separatist leader Igor Strelkov, pictured, claimed Mr El Gasim was a ‘black mercenary’ fighting for the Ukrainian government and that his passport had been found on the body of a dead soldier

His distraught parents did not learn of what their son had fully been through until he arrived home on Monday last week in case their phone calls were intercepted.

Mrs El Gasim: ‘We have been in hell, all day and all night we would be on the computer trying to help or praying with family and friends.

‘I just wanted my boy home safe and sound. We didn’t know what was happening as there were so many lies coming out of Donetsk.’

His father added: ‘Every website we saw said our son was dead. It was terrible. We didn’t know what had happened to him. We used to speak to him every day and then he just vanished. We are so relieved he is back with us now.’

The city of Donetsk, a key holding for the rebels, is currently under siege from the Ukrainian army.

After his disappearance, a blog written by separatist leader Igor Strelkov claimed Mr El Gasim was a ‘black mercenary’ fighting for the Ukrainian government and that his passport had been found on the body of a dead soldier.

Ambition: Mr El Gasim as a child with his brother, Alwaleed, and sisters, Monuira and Dalal. He says he now hopes to continue his medical studies in England and one day become a surgeon

Mr El Gasim, who is a keen rugby player, said that he now hopes to continue with his medical studies in England pursuit of his dream of becoming a surgeon.

He said: ‘I’m so happy to be home with my brothers and sisters. It hasn’t really sunk in yet what happened to me and it probably won’t do for a while.’

He said that before the city fell to the rebels, Donetsk had been a good place to live and study.

’I’d been enjoying my time in Donetsk,’ he added. ‘I had a girlfriend and enjoyed going out with friends.

‘When all the trouble started, things began to escalate. There were armed rebels everywhere, check points and curfews but this was the first trouble I’d got into.’

A Ukrainian university official in charge of foreign student welfare said this was this was the first time something like this had happened, adding: ‘This student happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.’
