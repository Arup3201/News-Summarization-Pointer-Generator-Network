This is one adorable bear who really likes the snow.

Nine-year-old Wei Wei likes nothing better than dancing and playing in the snow at Wuhan Zoo of Central China's Hubei province.

Showing off some impressive moves, the playful panda then sticks his tongue out, apparently hoping to get land a flying snowflake.

Wei Wei, who came to Wuhan Zoo in 2008 after the Sichuan earthquake near his old home, is said to get very excited by the falling snow.

The fun-loving bear showed off his dancing skills for his keepers and even gave them a cheeky wave from the top of his climbing frame.

He then showed off his acrobatic skills as tumbled off head-first into the snow before performing a roly-poly after a thin layer of snow fell over the zoo. 

The panda then seems to come over all shy, and is photographed covering his head in his hands. But it doesn't last for long as Wei Wei can't resist trying to catch a snowflake on his tongue.

With his thick black and white fur, Wei Wei was perfectly wrapped up for his joyful tumble in the snow in the freezing Wuhan City.

Giant pandas are solitary bears when in the wild, usually preferring their own company when foraging in Chinese bamboo forests.

Giant panda bears are an endangered species, with around 1,600 left roaming free in the cool forests that are their natural habitat, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

The bears are easily discernible due to their black and white coat and as a result the few left in the wild are often targeted by bounty hunters.

They mostly eat bamboo, but in captivity are also enjoy being fed honey, eggs, fish, yams, leaves, oranges, bananas and other special treats.
