Sarah Palin has taken to Facebook to defend a photo of her youngest son Trig standing on the family dog that sparked outrage.

The photo, which Palin shared on New Year's Day, was met with outrage across social media and by PETA, who released a statement saying; 'It’s odd that anyone — let alone a mother — would find it appropriate to post such a thing, with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo.'

Palin's response was written to PETA, who described her as a 'callous woman,' and focused not just on defending the photo but also asking why the organization has never objected to the actions of other celebrities - including President Obama.

Firing back: Sarah Palin (above) has responded to critics of a photo she posted of her son Trig and the family dog

Outrage: PETA was upset over this photo of 6-year-old Trig Palin (above) standing on the family dog

Old news: Palin says that at least her son 'didn't eat the dog,' and then goes on to say that President Obama (above) 'enjoys eating dog meat'

'Did you go as crazy when your heroic Man-of-Your-Lifetime, Barack Obama, revealed he actually enjoyed eating dead dog meat?' asks Palin at one point. 

This after she begins by saying; 'At least Trig didn't eat the dog.' 

The comment is in reference to Obama's admission many years ago that as a child in Indonesia he did once eat dog meat, and while how much or little he enjoyed the taste is not known, he did mock Palin at the 2012 White House Correspondents' Dinner saying; 'What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious.'

Palin also asks why PETA never attacked Ellen DeGeneres for a photo that her show's Instagram page posted this past July of a child standing on her dog to brush her teeth, though that child, a little girl, does appear to be much younger and smaller than 6-year-old Trig. 

The photos posted by Palin were meant to show her son's resilience, as she wrote of the boy, who has Down Syndrome; 'He, determined to help wash dishes with an oblivious mama not acknowledging his signs for "up!", found me and a lazy dog blocking his way. He made his stepping stone.' 

And in her response, she shared just how much she and her family love all of their animals.

'Our pets, including Trig’s best buddy Jill Hadassah, are loved, spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or don’t fit your flighty standards,' says Palin.

Love: 'Our pets, including Trig’s best buddy Jill Hadassah, are loved, spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man,' wrote Palin

Inspiring: The intial post was meant to inspire people at the start of 2015 by showing Trig's resilience 

She also uses the post to attack PETA's opposition to Alaska's most famous annual event, the Iditarod, calling it 'the Last Great Race honoring dogs who are born to run in wide open spaces.'

She then makes the claim that PETA, who she calls 'double-standard radicals,' keeps some of their pets 'in a concrete jungle where they’re allowed outdoors to breathe and pee maybe once a day.' 

Palin does however say that she and PETA do agree on one thing - 'respecting God’s creation and critters.' 

PETA, President Obama and Ellen DeGeneres have yet to respond to Palin's post. 

Dear PETA,

Chill. At least Trig didn’t eat the dog.

Hey, by the way, remember your “Woman of the Year”, Ellen DeGeneres? Did you get all wee-wee’d up when she posted this sweet picture?

Hypocritical, much?

Did you go as crazy when your heroic Man-of-Your-Lifetime, Barack Obama, revealed he actually enjoyed eating dead dog meat?

Aren’t you the double-standard radicals always opposing Alaska’s Iditarod – the Last Great Race honoring dogs who are born to run in wide open spaces, while some of your pets “thrive” in a concrete jungle where they’re allowed outdoors to breathe and pee maybe once a day? 

Aren’t you the same herd that opposes our commercial fishing jobs, claiming I encourage slaying and consuming wild, organic healthy protein sources called “fish”? (I do.)

Aren’t you the same anti-beef screamers blogging hate from your comfy leather office chairs, wrapped in your fashionable leather belts above your kickin’ new leather pumps you bought because your celebrity idols (who sport fur and crocodile purses) grinned in a tabloid wearing the exact same Louboutins exiting sleek cowhide covered limo seats on their way to some liberal fundraiser shindig at some sushi bar that features poor dead smelly roe (that I used to strip from our Bristol Bay-caught fish, and in a Dillingham cannery I packed those castoff fish eggs for you while laughing with co-workers about the suckers paying absurdly high prices to party with the throw away parts of our wild seafood)? I believe you call those discarded funky eggs “caviar”.

Yeah, you’re real credible on this, PETA. A shame, because I’ll bet we agree on what I hope is the true meaning of your mission – respecting God’s creation and critters.

Our pets, including Trig’s best buddy Jill Hadassah, are loved, spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or don’t fit your flighty standards.

Jill is a precious part of our world. So is Trig.
