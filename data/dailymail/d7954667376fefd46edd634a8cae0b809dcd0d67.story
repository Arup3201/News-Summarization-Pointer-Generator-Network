The Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader charged with having sex with one of her 16-year-old students has spoken out for the first time since the accusations - and has admitted she is 'dying inside'.

Sarah Jones, 27, is under house arrest after she was charged in Covington, Kentucky with sexual abuse for allegedly sleeping with a student at the high school where she taught English.

But speaking on the Today show, Jones branded the claims 'rumours' and said that the alleged 
victim and his family, who are friends with her own 
family, will all testify in her defense in court.

'I'm taking it day by day,' she said of the charges. 'Sometimes I take it minute by minute.'

Struggle: Sarah Jones, a former NFL cheerleader accused of having sex with one of her students, has spoken to the Today show to reveal her daily struggle dealing with the accusations

When asked how she was coping and if she
was 'dying inside,' she added: 'Yes, I am. I call my parents on a 
regular basis and I say, "What can I do just to get through just this 
minute?"'

Jones, a five-year veteran of the NFL's Ben-Gals cheerleading team, refused to discuss the details of the case, only saying the rumours were started by the alleged victim's bitter ex-girlfriend.

'Just because it’s a rumor, it can be very disruptive to a career,' she said.

She admitted there were 9,000 pages of photos, Facebook messages and texts between her and the student, but it 'does not mean that every single page has something that is going to prove this case'.

Jones is accused of having sex with a 
16-year-old football player at Dixie Heights High School, where she 
taught English. She had resigned from the school in November citing 
'personal reasons'.

Tough questions: Jones, who appeared on the show with her mother Cheryl and attorney Eric Deters, said there was no evidence she had sex with the teen boy

'Torture': Jones, pictured with her mother Cheryl, said she looks at every article written about her

The indictment, filed in March, states 
the alleged sexual relationship with the high school student took place 
between October 1 and December 31. She pleaded not guilty in April.

She also pleaded not guilty to 
unlawful use of electronic means to induce a minor to engage in sexual 
activities, a charge often reserved for people peddling child 
pornography over the internet.

Her mother Cheryl, 55, a middle 
school principal who is now on administrative leave, faces a single 
charge of tampering with evidence in her daughter's case. She also 
pleaded not guilty.

Sarah Jones told Today that the alleged victim and his family will testify in her defense.

The family appeared in court earlier this year alongside Jones and her mother, even though they had been ordered to have no contact with the family.

Accused: Jones was head cheerleader and five-year veteran of the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals

'Rumours': She also taught high school English but quit last November for 'personal reasons'

Case: The prosecution said it has 9,000 pages of photos and messages between Jones and her 'victim'

Her attorney, Charles Lester Jr, told the Cincinnati Enquirer: 'The 
families are friends.'

The interview comes on the same day Jones's 
attorney filed a motion to have the charges against her dropped, 
claiming that prosecutors have failed to provide proof that a crime 
occurred.

'The Commonwealth does not have ... a single witness that there was any sex,' lawyer Eric Deters wrote to the court, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.

'There is not a single sealed text 
message that would reflect there was sex in any state, much less 
Kentucky. There is no confession. There is no admission. There is only 
speculative conjecture.'

In the interview, Jones added that she has only had sex with one man, her ex-husband, Nathan Wilburn. They married in July last year and separated just one month later. They are now divorced.

She must wear an ankle bracelet and cannot leave the house.

Arrests: Jones, left, was charged with sexual abuse and her mother Cheryl, right, has been charged with covering for her daughter by asking a witness to 'destroy' a phone allegedly containing evidence

'I can't walk to the mailbox,' she said. 'If I go to the mailbox it starts beeping and that's a violation.'

She said she spends her time studying for the LSAT, and has started working for her lawyer as a paralegal. She also scours the internet looking for stories about her.

'The biggest thing is when people attack my character without knowing the full story,' she said.

Jones added that she knows the information about her on the internet will haunt her.

'I cant wait to get married and have kids
and start a life,' she said. 'The most devastating part is I can't imagine
[my children] getting on the internet and reading the comments about their mother like
that.'

Jones also grabbed headlines in 2009 when photographs and postings uploaded on TheDirty.com branded her a 'slut' with 'two STDs'.

In court: Jones appeared in court in April and pleaded not guilt to the charges. The family of the alleged victim was there to support her, even though she had been ordered not to contact them

Support: Jones, pictured with her mother, said the alleged victim and his family will testify in her defense

When she emailed the site to plead they take photographs down, more posts appeared claiming she had had sex with Bengals players.

Appearing on ABC at the time, she said: 'To stand in front of 30 15-year-olds and tell them you don't have two STDs and that you are not a slut is the hardest thing you will ever have to do.'

Ms Jones sued Nik Richie, TheDirty.com’s founder, for character defamation. She was awarded an $11million default judgement but the litigation is ongoing.

The mother and daughter are scheduled to stand trial in October.

Deters also filed a motion seeking to
dismiss the indictment against Jones’ mother, Cheryl Jones, who is 
charged with tampering with evidence in the case.
