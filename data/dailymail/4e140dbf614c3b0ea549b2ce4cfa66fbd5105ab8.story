She is known for taking on some controversial – and revealing – acting roles.

But Anna Friel has admitted she has managed to shock her parents only once – by emailing her father some pornographic images.

The 36-year-old, who plays Jean Raymond, the wife of porn baron Paul Raymond, in a new film called The Look Of Love, made the embarrassing slip-up while she was researching her role.

‘I sent an email to my dad with some pictures of Jean Raymond,’ she said. ‘He called me afterwards and said, “I think you’re going a bit far on this one.”

‘I wondered what he meant and then I realised I’d sent him an email attachment of an actual porn shoot that Jean did – I mean, everything. I was mortified.’

Friel, who first hit the headlines aged 16 for filming a lesbian kiss scene in Brookside, admitted her parents were not usually surprised by anything she did. ‘I was brought up in a very open household – I’m very close to my papa and he’s not easily shocked.’

And the actress, who also appeared naked in BBC drama The Tribe in 1998 and on stage in Breakfast At Tiffany’s four years ago, revealed that she has no problems baring all.

‘I didn’t mind being naked,’ she said in an interview in April’s edition of Easy Living magazine, which is accompanied by photographs of her taken by rock star Bryan Adams.

‘I’ve always been OK with my body. We’ve all got t**s. I’ve also got b***s – I just don’t show them very often.’

Friel, who has a daughter from a previous relationship with actor David Thewlis, said juggling the demands of motherhood and acting was a challenge: ‘I’m 36. My friends are freezing their eggs. It’s much harder to be a woman these days.

'We’ve got to do everything – work, cope with the travelling and still be a mother.’
