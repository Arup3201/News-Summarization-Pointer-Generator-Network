This is the moment a hapless calf got stuck neck-deep in a badger sett.

The unsuspecting animal was strolling through pastures in Looe, Cornwall, when the ground suddenly gave way.

Farmer Jim Candy heard the bovine's anguished moos and found it wedged up to its head in the earth.

Help me Mum! This calf was strolling through pastures in Looe, Cornwall, when the ground suddenly gave way

Damaging a sett is illegal under a 
1973 law to stop badger baiting but Mr Candy decided the only way to 
save the animal was to dig it out.

He said: 'I knew something was wrong when I heard the cow calling for her calf before I even got to the field.

'After
a short search, I found the week old calf wedged firmly in the badger 
hole. He was well and truly stuck and we had to dig him out.' 

Mr Candy, who is also a Liberal 
Democrat member of Cornwall Council, said he realised the action could 
land him in trouble with both the police and the RSPCA but said the welfare of his cattle was the priority.

He said: 'I know it is illegal to interfere with a badger set but felt that my first duty was to the calf.'

The cow emerged with just a few scratches.

Mr Candy said the case highlighted inconsistencies with existing laws that farmers had to deal with on a daily basis.

'The law covering this was brought in in 1973 to stop badger baiting, and quite rightly so,' he said.

'But there are these unfortunate consequences which have occurred as the
badger population has exploded and we have a situation where the 
badgers are becoming a pest for more reasons that TB.

The pair were later reunited. Mr Candy realised that interferring with a badger's sett could land him in trouble

'I like to encourage wildlife but the increase in badger numbers worries
me. We haven't seen a hedgehog on the farm for decades, we have sky 
larks which nest on the ground and of course there is always the 
increased risk of going down with TB again.'

A spokesman for the RSPCA said: 'We do appreciate the fact that this farmer was trying to rescue his calf and has been open and honest about the situation.

'We do encourage people not to disturb badger setts whenever possible.'

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said that the matter had not been brought to his attention.

'The only thing I can say is that there has been no report made to the control room.'
