Read Martin Samuel's match report from the pulsating Capital One Cup semi-final first leg draw at Anfield 

Liverpool's Capital One Cup semi-final with Chelsea is evenly poised going into next week’s decisive second leg at Stamford Bridge, but there is little doubt that Brendan Rodgers’s side edged a 1-1 draw at Anfield on Tuesday night.

A return to the high-octane displays of last season had the Premier League leaders rocking on their heels in the second half as Rodgers out-manoeuvred his old Chelsea mentor Jose Mourinho in most aspects of the game.

Sportsmail looks at how Liverpool’s tactics have not only given them a real chance of reaching Wembley but may also serve as a blueprint for the rest of the league in how to tackle Mourinho’s men in the second half of the season.

MAGIC OVER MATIC

Nemanja Matic has been outstanding in his defensive midfield role this season, but the movement and trickery of Philippe Coutinho disrupted the axis of Matic and John Obi Mikel in much the same way that Christian Eriksen wreaked havoc with the Serb and Cesc Fabregas when Tottenham hammered Chelsea 5-3 on New Year’s Day. 

On Tuesday night, they had no answer to Coutinho as he pulled them out of position, and it was no surprise that his pass split the pair in the build-up to Liverpool’s equaliser. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded in 341 minutes since Nacer Chadli’s effort for Spurs.

UNCOMFORTABLE CAHILL

Raheem Sterling might have been recharging his batteries in Jamaica recently but it was Gary Cahill who looked like he was running on sand when his England team-mate scored a memorable goal to level the tie in the second half. 

Again there were comparisons with the Spurs game in the way that the direct running of Harry Kane and Sterling unsettled Cahill. 

The Chelsea defender inexplicably backed off Sterling and failed to make a challenge as the Liverpool man powered past him en route to goal.

It exposed a more general weakness on the right-hand side of Mourinho’s defence with full-back Branislav Ivanovic caught out of position on several occasions.

COSTA CUT-OFF

Diego Costa was in awesome form in Chelsea’s 5-0 drubbing of Swansea at the weekend as the Premier League’s top scorer added another two to go even further ahead with 17 goals. 

However, Liverpool shut down the Spain striker with Martin Skrtel particularly effective at anticipating balls into him and giving Costa little time or space. 

As a consequence, Chelsea’s £32million man cut an increasingly frustrated figure as he became involved in spats with several Liverpool players and was taunted by the home supporters.

HALT HAZARD

Intentional fouling is not to be applauded but neither should teams simply sit back and allow themselves to be ripped apart by the brilliance of players like Eden Hazard. 

Liverpool trod a fine line at times and Steven Gerrard and Lucas Leiva were both booked for taking down the mercurial Belgian. 

However, Rodgers showed that Hazard can be stopped by putting two men – sometimes three – on him to close him down every time he got the ball.

The result was that Hazard had surprisingly little impact on the game after winning and converting a penalty in the first half.

PRESS THE PRESSERS

Few teams can press as well as Chelsea, but Liverpool provided a masterclass in the art as they returned to the high-energy performances of last season. 

Insatiable in attack as they powered towards The Kop in the second half, Rodgers’ side were equally breathless in defence as they swarmed all over Chelsea like an army of red ants. 

Anfield reverberated in its appreciation of the effort and Mourinho’s side were simply not allowed to have the time on the ball or the composure to establish their normal tempo and control over the game.
