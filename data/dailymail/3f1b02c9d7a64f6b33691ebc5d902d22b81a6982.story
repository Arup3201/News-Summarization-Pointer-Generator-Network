They are supposedly Kanye West's closest friends.

So it can only be seen as the ultimate snub that Jay Z and Beyonce were no-show at the rapper's extravagant nuptials to Kim Kardashian on Saturday.

While the couple's famous friends and family flocked to 16th century Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy, Beyonce and her husband were in the Hamptons, according to US Weekly magazine.

It was thought Jay Z would be the best man at the wedding, as the two rappers have grown very close and often collaborate on musical ventures together.

But in avoiding the wedding, Jay Z and Beyonce also swerved a potentially awkward run in with Rachel Roy.

Beyonce and Solange had 'words' with Rachel at the Met Ball after party in NYC, and our source told us that it all stemmed from Rachel’s 'too close relationship with Jay Z, according to Hollywood Life.

Then the row is said to have continued between Solange and Jay Z, and spilled into that elevator bust up.

It's certainly odd that Jay Z was in attendance for his close friend's big day.

Just this week Kanye was named the headliner of the 99 Problems Made In America music festival - a sought after sport by the world's top artists.

As
 if their no show was not enough, Beyonce seemed to be sending a message
 about her attendance as she posted a make-up free selfie on her 
Instagram, with no comment, as the wedding got underway.

But later she appeared to have a change of heart posting a touching photograph of the West family with the message: 'Wishing you a lifetime of unconditional love. God bless your beautiful family.'

And then moments later she followed that with a picture of clouds against a blue sky through a window but with no message of explanation.

On Friday night, speculation started that the musical powerhouse pair were not coming when they were conspicuous in 
their absence as 600 guests gathered at the Palace of Versailles to mark
 the beginning of celebrations.

It had been reported that notoriously private Queen Bey was unhappy attending the event because  of the huge media interest.

And the thought of appearing on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the family's reality show, did not go down well.

A source told Radar
 that Beyonce, 32, had informed Kanye that: 'under no circumstances will
 she be a part of any filming on the wedding day if it’s for Kim’s 
reality show.'

A spokesman for the mother of one refused to comment on the report.

Kim, 33, attempted to pal up with Beyonce soon after starting dating Kanye.  But her friendly approaches are widely reported to have been rebuffed.

Here comes the guests: Is this chaos why Beyonce was so keen to avoid the wedding?

Indeed,
 after the pair were spotted dancing together as they watched their 
husbands in concert, Beyonce was blasted by her fans - and the pair have
 not been seen in such circumstances since.

But perhaps the attendance of Lana del Rey is the reason why Beyonce is keen to stay away.

Lana who performed three songs at Friday's Versailles dinner, is fast becoming more popular than the 32 year-old.

The
 couple have also been dogged by rumors of marriage difficulties which 
intensified following the elevator bust-up between Jay Z and his sister 
in law Solange.

Solange
 ferociously attacked the rapper as they left the Met Gala after party 
on May 5th and the family were forced to release a statement when video 
footage of the brawl leaked.

Fans will be hoping for the best however as the music power couple, parents to daughter Blue Ivy, are due to embark on their first concert tour together beginning on June 25th in  Miami.
