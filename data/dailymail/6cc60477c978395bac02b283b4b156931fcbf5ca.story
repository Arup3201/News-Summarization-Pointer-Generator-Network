Disciplined: Dame Judi Dench revealed she learns a new poem or word every day to keep her mind active

Dame Judi Dench has revealed she learns a new poem or word every day to keep her mind active after a survey found nearly half of pensioners were concerned about life in older age.

The Oscar-winning actress, 79, joined actor Sir Tony Robinson and Slade frontman Noddy Holder for the poll of more than 2,000 people aged over 65, in which they were asked for their 'bucket list' of things they want to do before they die.

Sir Tony, 68, best known as Blackadder's sidekick Baldrick in the BBC series, said he dreamt of becoming an internationally renowned professional gambler, according to telecare service provider Centra Pulse, which commissioned the research.

Holder, also 68, revealed he wanted to travel the world in a yacht, while Dame Judi said she did not have a bucket list but she did learn a new poem or word each day, the company said.

The YouGov poll found that flying a plane, speaking a foreign language and playing a musical instrument were the most popular skills over-65s wanted to master.

But 40% of pensioners said they were worried about life getting more difficult as they grow older, Centra Plus said.

Wendy Darling, the firm's managing director, said: 'Today's over-65s have a set of ambitions that would put most twenty-somethings to shame. 

It's so important that they are given access to the right support which will help them achieve their dreams.

'Despite this impressive list of ambitions, we found that 40% of over-65s are still worried about life getting more difficult as they grow older.

'That's why we're urging older people not to forget about the care out there which will help them hold on to their independence for longer both inside and outside of the home.'

Some 30% of pensioners said that travel was their top wish during retirement, with Australia as the most popular destination.

Buying a house, going to university and falling in love were also on the list of things over-65s said they still wanted to do before they die.
