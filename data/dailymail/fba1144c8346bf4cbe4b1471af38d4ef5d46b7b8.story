An English girl was flown to hospital after an accident in Austria in which a British tour bus was hit by a Polish lorry.

The accident happened on the busy A12 Autobahn in Tyrol, Austria, heading towards Arlberg and left debris scattered across the road after the lorry disintegrated when it bounced off the bus and hit the central reservation.

Two people were taken to hospital by ambulance and the air ambulance was called to take the girl to hospital after she suffered from shock and ended up with an asthma attack.
