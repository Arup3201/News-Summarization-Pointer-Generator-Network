It is a Georgian mansion that was built by members of the British aristocracy and was lived in by rock royalty.

Now Warren House in Crowborough, East Sussex, is on the market for Â£2,950,000.

Surrounded by 11.6 acres of land, the house in the heart of the countryside has six bedrooms, a swimming pool, tennis courts and a separate flat to entertain guests.

Gardens: Outside the house there are 11.6 acres of land with a tennis court, surrounded by trees and stone statues

After it was built in the 18th century by Countess Castle-Stewart, the Grade II listed property was home to Greek shipping family the Pateras and it 
was once used as a hotel.

Then it became a musician's choice when John Paul Jones, the bass guitarist from Led Zeppelin, moved in.

It was also owned by Adam Faith, a British teen idol and film star from the 1960s, who passed away in 2003.

Estate agents Chesterton Humberts say it is 'a magnificent home surrounded by glorious gardenswith majestic views over the Ashdown Forest.'

The brochure adds: 'Warren House occupies a wonderful elevated position, taking advantage of the uninterrupted views over the Ashdown Forest on the southern outskirts of the popular village of Crowborough.

'This beautiful Grade II Listed Georgian Palladian house dates in the main part from the 18th century with later additions and dominates the surrounding countryside, being in a truly remarkable position, over looking its own gardens and grounds to the Ashdown Forest beyond.'

'The house was designed to impress both inside and out, the room sizes and ceiling height are dramatic, the architecture sublime.

'The views from the principal reception rooms and main bedrooms are magnificent. Oak panelling, original fireplaces and decorative plaster ceilings feature in the ground floor reception rooms.

'The south eastern end of the ground floor contains a former scullery, sitting room and workshop that have much potential for redesign and refurbishment.

'Remarkable room sizes and ceiling height also benefit much of the first floor, where a generous principal bedroom suite comprises not only a bedroom and bathroom but also a substantial dressing room of note.'

John Paul Jones, is the bassist, keyboardist, and co-songwriter for the English, and has also developed a solo career.

The house was also lived in by British singer and film star Adam Faith, who passed away in 2003

In 1976 he allowed the house to be used for the the band's concert film, which included footage of their tour and followed the band during their day-to-day lives.

Adam Faith was a British teen idol, singer, actor, and financial journalist who passed away in 2003.

He was one of the most charted acts of the 1960s and became the first UK artist to lodge his initial seven hits in the Top 5.

He did not write his own material, and much of his early success was through partnership with songwriter Les Vandyke and John Barry.
