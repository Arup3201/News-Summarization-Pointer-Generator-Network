Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries, whose name has become synonymous with the term 'fat-shaming', has no intention of being pushed out of the struggling company when his contract expires in February.

Far from being replaced, Mr Jeffries -- who caused controversy after openly shunning larger-size customers earlier this year -- has signed a new contract despite his 'history of operational missteps'.

With a $1.5million salary, the executive's employment agreement will be extended by at least a year beyond its February 1 expiration date, according to the New York Post.

He will also have target incentives worth as much as $6million, annual bonuses of up to $4.5million, and use of the company’s $200,000 aircraft is also built into the contract. 

Business Insider reported last week that shareholders were pushing for Mr Jeffries to be replaced.

'Given the Company’s history of operational missteps, taken together with Mr. Jeffries’ age and his increasingly controversial reputation, the Board must not let this opportunity pass,' Engaged Capital Managing Director Glenn W. Welling wrote in a letter to the board.

Engaged Capital owns less than one per cent of the company's shares.

'A little fresh blood would definitely benefit the company,' Morningstar Inc analyst Bridget Weishaar added. But Ms Weishaar added that she was 'highly doubtful this letter [would] change anything.'

Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch are down 26per cent over the past year.

In an effort to reclaim lost profits, the struggling fashion chain decided to expand its offering to include larger sizes last month
following a major backlash against Mr Jeffries' comments that the chain 
only caters to 'cool' and 'attractive' kids.

The
 brand, which suffered plummeting share prices in the wake of the 
scandal earlier this year, admitted that it realized the potential financial 
success that larger sizes could have in its stores.

The
 news came after a 2006 comment from CEO Mike Jeffries was widely 
recirculated in the media this year, inspiring a boycott from Hollywood 
stars including Miley Cyrus, Ellen Degeneres and Kirstie Alley, and 
accusations that it was discriminating against overweight customers.

Engaged Capital’s Mr Welling said in a Monday letter that he was 'disturbed' by the retailer’s announcement to  extend Mr Jeffries contract, and is 'considering options' for the firm.
