Mark Hughes has spoken of his deep desire to keep Peter Crouch at Stoke as the former England striker moves into the final six months of his current contract.

The Stoke manager believes Crouch still has a ‘number of seasons’ remaining as a top-flight footballer and wants him to sign a new two-year deal.

Hughes also wants to tie Glenn Whelan down for another two years as he edges closer to being available on a free transfer in the summer.

'If we tried to replace Peter Crouch it would be very difficult for us and it would be a significant outlay so it’s in our own interests to try and re-contract him if we can,' said Hughes. 

‘He is a big part of what we do here. His age isn’t an issue in my view because he’s a player whose strengths aren’t based on pace but his other attributes are likely to remain with him for any number of seasons after this one.

'Where he is in his career is still a good place and he’s an important player for us. There have been contract discussions already and I think peoples’ minds can concentrate on contracts and players in January so we will start the process.’

The strike against Palace was Crouch's fifth goal of the season in all competitions

On Whelan, Hughes added: 'There is something on the table for Glenn and was early on in the season, there have been more discussions about that. There are any number of players that their situation is fluid, we just have to make sure Stoke City as a club are strengthened and strong.

'That means we don’t let anybody leave even if there’s a real interest or situations that might develop. It’s about making sure we are strong as a club. From our point of view we are not anticipating anyone leaving, that’s not what we need to do.’
