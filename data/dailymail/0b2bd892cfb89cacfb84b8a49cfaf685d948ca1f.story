The 74-year-old mother of legendary baseball star Cal Ripken Jr is too traumatized to return home after she was kidnapped at gunpoint last week.

Ripken appealed for the public's help in locating the man responsible for the 'bizarre' and 'unsettling' abduction at a news conference in Baltimore today.

Violet Ripken was taken from her 
Aberdeen, Maryland, home at around 7am last Tuesday by a 
handgun-wielding thug who dragged her into her 1998 Lincoln Town Car and
 sped off.

Appeal: Cal Ripken Jr. looks upset while speaking about his mothers kidnapping during a news conference at Oriole Park in Baltimore on Friday August 3, 2012

The Hall of Fame infielder appeared 
to choke up as he described a phone call from his sister last week 
indicating that his mother might be missing. He said it was 'a horrible 
night.'

Vi Ripken was found unharmed in her car, but Ripken says she remains shaken up and is too traumatized to return the home where she and her husband, Cal Sr., raised four children. She is staying with family..

'I appreciate all the outpouring of love and support for our family, ' he said. 'Mom is doing pretty good. It's a 
traumatic situation that she was involved in, traumatic for all of us in
 the family, and we're trying really hard to come together and support each other in this.

'But mom, by and large, is a tough, strong woman, and was able to endure this and she's doing pretty good.'

He said there's reason to believe the
 kidnapping was planned in advance, but he said he can't be sure and 
doesn't know why she was targeted. 'It's bizarre in many ways,' he said.

Investigators say there was no ransom
 demand, and the elder Ripken has said her abductor appeared not to know
 that she was the mother of the retired Baltimore Oriole who owns 
baseball's record for most consecutive games played.

Police have said little about the investigation but have released a sketch of a suspect and video surveillance footage pulled from a store.

A manhunt for the pensioner and her 
attacker was launched by the Aberdeen Police Department who described the 
case as a missing persons investigation.

As they searched police in Baltimore County, Maryland got a call from an anonymous tipster about a suspicious vehicle.

According to wbaltv.com the
 call came from a passerby who spotted Ms Ripken and her attacker in the
 back seat of his car where he had bundled her in, tied up.

The unnamed source confronted the man who said Ms Ripken was his mother and that he was taking her to hospital.

But the source was not convinced so called the police who contacted the Aberdeen department to suggest that the car might be linked to their investigation.

For a terrifying 24 hours, Ms Ripken's 
distressed family had no clue as to her whereabouts while police 
desperately searched for clues.

She was eventually found at around 6am on Wednesday, bound and blindfolded in her car not far from her home.

'This has been a very trying time for 
our family, but we are grateful and relieved that mom is back with us, 
safe and healthy,' said a statement released by the Ripken family after her safe return.

'We want to thank everyone for their tremendous support, especially all of the law enforcement agencies that worked so hard and quickly.'

The abductor, believed to be a white male in his late 30s to early 40s, remains at large.Â 

Ms Ripkin described him as tall and thin and said he was wearing glasses, a light-coloured shirt and camouflage print trousers.

The FBI is also involved in the investigation.
