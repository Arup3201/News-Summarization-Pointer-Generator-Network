A Utah mother has given birth to a 14lb baby boy who's already wearing the same sized diapers as his two-year-old twin sisters.

Joel Brandon Jr., nicknamed J.J., was born by cesarean section on May 9 at Timpanogos Regional Hospital in 
Orem, weighing in at 14 pounds and measuring 22 inches long.

He is believed to be the heaviest baby born in the U.S. this year; only Addyson Gale Cessna of Pennsylvania, who weighed 13 pound 12 ounce, comes close.

His mother, Sara Brandon, said she was stunned by how big J.J. was when she delivered him at 38-and-a-half weeks, as a previous ultrasound predicted he was going to be 11 pounds.

The family is now wondering if their bundle of joy is indeed this year's biggest.

'We've kind of been watching and waiting to see if there is a baby who is bigger, because he might be the biggest of the year,' Brandon told KSL.

But because of his size, he needed two doctors to help with the birth, rather than one, and required special maneuvering as he was 'so big and crammed in there', she told the Huffington Post.

After he was born, he suffered respiratory problems and needed to spend a week in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. But he has since returned home and is in good health, his mother said.

Cute: J.J.'s is in the 150th percentile for height and weight for his age but will slim down as he gets older

At his last check-up, J.J.'s doctor said he was in the 150th percentile for height and weight for his age group - and he's so big that he is wearing the same sized diapers of his twin sisters, aged 2.

KSL reported that his size could be because of his mother's Type 1 diabetes or simply because of her family's history of big babies and her husband's height.

But doctors said that as J.J. grows and becomes a toddler he'll slim down closer to average size.

'This big bubba melts my heart,' Brandon 
said. 'I love him more than I ever imagined I could love a sweet baby 
boy. He is my squishy cuddle bug.'

Together: His mom said his big sisters love to play with him - but he's too big for them to hold on their own

Brandon joked that she doesn't think she can have normal sized babies as her two-year-old twins were born weighing just 4lbs each.

She added that the girls love to play with him - although they can't hold him on their own.

While J.J. could be the largest born in the U.S. this year, KSL noted that the biggest newborn in the world is likely George King from England, who was born in February weighing 15 pounds 7 ounces.
