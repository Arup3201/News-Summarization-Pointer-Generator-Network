A former Little League mom has revealed how a car accident left her in so much pain she became a heroin addict and stole thousands of dollars to fund her habit.

Nicole Koester, 42, who is now serving 13-and-a-half years at Maryland Correctional Institution for Women spoke to Diane Sawyer as part of an ABC special, 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', which will air on Friday night.

The married mother-of-three, who had been the manager of a car company, explained how she would watch Sawyer in the mornings as she packed lunchboxes for her children. 

But after suffering a car crash, she was prescribed oxycodone for her pain - but soon she had moved on to heroin, which was cheaper, she said.

'It just happened,' she said. 'It was for pain and then I realized it made everything so easy.

'Every night you're not doing it anymore - you're done, you're done, you're done - until the next morning when you start feeling sick.'

To fund her habit, she started stealing checks from other people's mailboxes before dipping them in a solution to get rid of the ink, according to a WBOC report.

She then wrote the checks out to herself for amounts between $200 and $1,500 before cashing them - ultimately stealing more than $30,000 from 26 people, ABC reported.

Torn apart: Only one of her sons, pictured left, has visited her in prison, along with her husband

Her crimes were carried out through Maryland, Delaware and Virginia. 

'Things that will hit me that I've done that I've forgotten about,' a tearful Koester told Sawyer.

In 2011, she was arrested and sentenced to 13 years and six months.

She now works as an office manager in the prison sewing shop, where she earns $2.75 per day, and takes part in the prison's dog program, 'Canine Partners for Life'.

Her husband continues to visit her in prison but only one of her children has made the trip, she said. 

'He's the only one that talks to me,' she told Sawyer of her son. 'But I mean, I ruined their lives. I'm no different from anyone in here.'

Investigation: Dianne Sawyer spoke to Koester as part of an ABC special on women locked up in prison

Sawyer told Good Morning America that Koester's story is similar to those shared by an increasing number of women behind bars: white females who turn to crime to fund painkiller habits. 

The veteran journalist traveled to prisons in Tennessee, Maryland, Florida and Washington for the ABC special, which will air on ABC on Friday at 10pm EST. The special was filmed over eight months.

During the program, she examines mental health in a prison system where so many prisoners are ill, how prisoners acquire contraband and issues involving sentencing.

Prison life is a story she has returned to for ABC, spending two nights in an Atlanta prison in 2004 for a first-person look and doing a 1996 show on life inside a maximum security prison.
