Gunman: Bartholomew Granger started a shootout outside the court where his trial was taking place

A grand jury has amended the charges against the suspect in a fatal shooting outside a Texas courthouse to make him eligible for the death penalty.

Bartholomew Granger, is accused of the March 14 death of 79-year-old Minnie Sebolt. He was set for trial later this month on nine felony charges.

A grand jury Thursday elevated the charges to include capital murder.

Prosecutors say the 41-year-old Granger was trying to kill relatives in retaliation for testimony against him at his sexual assault trial. Sebolt was caught in the gunfire.

Assistant District Attorney Ed Shettle says the trial - moved to Galveston - now won't start until next year. He says the death penalty isn't likely to be waived and prosecutors probably will let a jury decide punishment.

In March, Granger, apparently shot his 20-year-old daughter and her mother as he went on a rampage during the lunch recess of the trial at Jefferson County Courthouse in Beaumont, Texas.

His daughter Samantha Jackson, who testified against him in March, was in critical condition after the shootout, and a 79-year-old bystander was dead.

After the shooting, Granger ran to a nearby building and took hostages while being besieged by police, but the hostages turned on him and took away his gun.

When negotiating with officials he apparently sounded more concerned with seeking medical treatment than with evading justice, and upon emerging from the building he was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. 

Hospital: All four shooting victims and the gunman were taken for medical treatment

Seabolt was shot as she tried to escape Granger's onslaught by running in to the courthouse, and died of her wounds.

As the gunman fled the scene, he ran over his own daughter with a pickup truck, sending her to hospital where she remains in a critical condition. The other two victims - Granger's ex-wife and another bystander - were treated at hospital but released later in the day.

When
he sought shelter in a business in the neighbourhood, the building's 
occupants 'refused to be victims' and fought back instead, according to 
police.

'They took the gun away from him and unlocked the door for the SWAT team,' a spokesman said.

Granger
agreed to surrender himself in exchange for medical treatment, but when
he was discharged from hospital he was immediately dispatched to jail.

He had been rushed to the hospital with 'very serious injuries', according to police.

Standoff: Police marksmen stake out the building where Granger held several people hostage

Photographs taken by the Beaumont Enterprise show that Granger shot one victim just outside of the courthouse.

Judge Larry Gist, whose courtroom is 
in the building where the shooting took place, told CNN that he 
'believed one of the witnesses may have 
been the mother of the child'.

'It was pandemonium,' said Judge Gist, describing the scene outside the courthouse.

When he heard gunshots ring out, 
witness Ricky Gandy said he rushed to his office window, whch overlooks a
parking lot near the shooting scene.

'Once it started, it was kind of like
the Fourth of July,' said Gandy. 'Several shots, I imagine, I'm 
guessing at least 30 shots all together.'

Granger had
been on trial at the courthouse since Monday and was scheduled to 
resume testimony Wednesday afternoon, Judge John Stevens told KFDM.

The
41-year-old has a lengthy criminal history that includes convictions 
for possession of marijuana and unlawfully carrying a firearm, according
to police reports.

Granger's lawyer Rife Kimler said the ongoing case was emotional, but he thought the trial had been going reasonably well.

'I didn't have him on my list of 
dangerous ones,' Kimler said of Granger. 'I've been doing this 21 years,
and the ones I think are dangerous are in a file in my head. He wasn't 
in that file.'
