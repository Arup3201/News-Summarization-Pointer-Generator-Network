Gatwick airport was forced to close its only runway for 20 minutes on Sunday while an Air China flight performed an emergency landing.

Planes arriving and departing from the West Sussex airport were delayed after pilots discovered a fault with the plane's landing gear on board flight CA852 shortly after take-off.

The plane, owned of China's biggest airline, sent out a ‘squawk’ code 7700, which is the international signal for an unspecified emergency.

Data from Flightradar showed the AIrbus A330 - flying from London to Beijing - circling over Sussex and the English Channel at 8,000ft before finally returning to the airport.

It took off as scheduled at 1.30pm but landed almost two hours later after reportedly dumping fuel, which is usually done to lighten the aircraft or reduce the risk of fire.

Passengers claim that the captain announced the gear could not be retracted after take-off, requiring them to return to London.

An observer on the ground reported the wheels at the front of the aircraft had been lifted up, but the main landing gear towards the read of the plane appeared to still be down when the aircraft climbed out of Gatwick.

The runway at Gatwick airport was closed for 20 minutes before the plane was towed to a stand

A spokesperson at Gatwick said the runway was closed shortly after 3.20pm but was re-opened around 20 minutes later before the plane towed to a stand.

He added: 'Due to a technical issue, an Air China aircraft had to make a return journey to Gatwick Airport. 

'It landed safely with no injury to passengers. The runway was temporarily closed‎ while the aircraft was safely taxiied to a stand. 

'The runway was reopened within 20 minutes and as a result there were some minor delays to outbound aircraft.'

The flight landed safely and no injuries were reported on board.
