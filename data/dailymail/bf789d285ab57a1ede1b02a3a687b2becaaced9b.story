Lewis Hamilton has plenty of reasons to celebrate after overturning a 22-point deficit to lead the Formula One World Championship on Sunday with a win at the Singapore Grand Prix.

But those monitoring the Brit's fitness may not have been too amused to see him digging into a 1.6kg steak in Kuala Lumpur in front of the Petronas Towers.

Hamilton made the most of Nico Rosberg being forced to retire on Sunday, pipping Sebastian Vettel to the line to win his 29th F1 career race.

And he was still in fine mood on Monday, posting the picture while saying: 'Out here in Kuala Lumpur. 1.6kg steak with the Petronas Towers behind me. I need someone to carry me outta this place.... #Petronas #kualalumpur #toomuchfood'

Hamilton insists he is in a strong position to win the driver's championship and will allow nothing to get in his way.

'This year, with all the difficult scenarios I have had, what really encourages me is how I have come through them.'
