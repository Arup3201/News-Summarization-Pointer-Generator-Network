A one-year-old child has been rescued and returned safely to the arms of her mother on the New South Wales' Central Coast.

NSW Police officers had to smash the window of a Holden Captiva SUV after the young girl became trapped about 10am on Tuesday.

Emergency crews were on the Lakedge Avenue scene in Berkeley Vale five minutes after they received a triple-0 call from the child's distressed mother.

Emergency services received a call from a distressed mother on Lakedge Avenue in Berkeley Vale

NSW Central Coast police rescued the child by smashing in a window as she started getting distressed

Tuggerah Lakes Area Command duty officer Tim Winmill said police could not wait for NRMA to free the child from the car as soaring temperatures made her tearful.

Mr Winmill said officers also had to hose down the car with water to cool it down as the mercury rose to 27 degrees in the area on Tuesday.

'Police arrived at the scene in five minutes [after the triple-0 call] and had to wait for NRMA to get into the car as the child was not distressed at the time,' Mr Winmill told Daily Mail Australia.

'But due to the heat, the child became distressed and started crying and police had to smash the window of the car.

Police received the call at 10am on Tuesday and saved her within 10 minutes

A NSW Ambulance spokeswoman said the child was not taken to hospital but treated at the scene

'All the windows were up so they were more concerned for the child’s well being.

'[The mother] was upset, she was very supportive of police of smashing window of the car to get her little one out.'

Mr Winmill also cautioned parents to look out for their child as the hot weather sets in. 

'This time of the year people should be vigilant about leaving their child in the car because of the heat,' he said.

'Cars can very hot, very quickly.'

The child was rescued from the car within 10 minutes and Mr Winmill said the one-year-old did not suffer any injuries during the incident.

Temperatures in Berkeley Vale soared to a maximum of 27 degrees on Tuesday

It comes just days after police tried to free a young Queensland girl who was accidentally locked in a car by her mother.

On Tuesday, emergency services were called to the Aldi car park in Gympie, north of Brisbane, after the distressed two-year-old started to overheat.

This comes as state roadside assistance bodies around Australia have revealed they are called to save thousands of children from locked cars each year, issuing a warning to parents and passersby to be extra vigilant as we enter the warmer months. 

Gympie police officer Steve Buchanan tried but could not smash his way into the vehicle with his baton while waiting for roadside assistance from the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) to unlock the car, The Gympie Times reported.

He chipped and scratched the car but was unable to get in to the Mazda 3 hatch.

After a number of minutes the RACQ arrived and were able to unlock the rear passenger door.

The toddler, who was unharmed, jumped into her relieved mother's arms.
