South Africa international Jacques Potgieter has been fined for making homophobic comments during a Super Rugby game in Australia.

The Australian Rugby Union announced they had imposed a 20,000 Australian dollars (£10,450) fine, with 10,000 dollars suspended, on flanker Potgieter following an incident in Sunday's clash between the Waratahs and Brumbies in Sydney.

The ARU said that Waratahs forward Potgieter admitted making comments 'contrary to the Australian Rugby Union's inclusion policy', which is designed to stamp out all forms of discrimination and homophobia in rugby.

Potgieter's penalty relates to a breach of the ARU code of conduct, which prohibits homophobic or racist comments.

ARU chief executive Bill Pulver said: 'We take the issue of homophobia in sport seriously and want to provide a positive environment for everyone involved in rugby. Comments of this nature cannot be tolerated.

'Our inclusion policy reinforces Australian Rugby's commitment to ensure every individual - whether they are players, supporters, coaches or administrators - feel safe, welcome and included, regardless of race, gender or sexuality.

'I would like to stress again that there is absolutely no place for homophobia or any form of discrimination in our game, and our actions and words on and off the field must reflect that.'

The ARU said that 28-year-old Potgieter will be required to undergo additional educational and awareness training.
