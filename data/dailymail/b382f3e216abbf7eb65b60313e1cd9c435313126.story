With the half-term break just around the corner, a soaring pound could save holidaymakers hundreds.

Prices have plunged at popular European resorts and travellers are seeing their money go further in other exotic destinations around the world. And sterling has surged to six-year high against the euro with many resorts also slashing prices as they vie for custom.

Costs have plummeted by up to 20 per cent over the past year in 10 out of 12 worldwide destinations, according to the Post Office's latest Winter Sunshine Report.

Winter sun: Goods in popular tourist resorts such as Spain will cost families less than last year this half term

The report, which compared the total cost of eight travel 'basket' items, priced all at just £44.03 in Costa del Sol

1. Cup of filter coffee at cafe/bar

2. Bottle of local lager at cafe/bar

3. Bottle/can of Coca Cola at cafe/bar

4. Glass of wine at cafe/bar

5. Bottle of mineral water (1.5L) at supermarket

6. Suncream at supermarket

Post Office Travel Money researchers have compared prices for a basket of eight items to compile a barometer of prices in popular holiday locations.

Top of the list for value for money was the Costa del Sol, in Spain, where holidaymakers can enjoy a three-course family meal for £32.49, a cup of coffee for just under £1 and a glass of wine for around £1.40.

There are good deals to be had in a few further-flung destinations including Tobago where prices are down 18 per cent from last year.

A meal will set visitors back around £51.31 with a glass of wine costing £2.64 and a can of cola 74p.

At Mauritius's coastal village of Grand Baie resort prices are down 15 per cent with a bottle of lager at a local cafe or bar costing £2.13, a bottle of mineral water 53p and a meal just over £81.83.

Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket, said: 'It's fantastic news that the cost of holidaying to many popular destinations is going down just as we head into winter and the colder months of the year.

Tobago in the Caribbean is another good bargain resort destination, with prices down 18% from last year

Likewise, the coastal town of Grand Baie in Mauritius has seen travel essential prices drop by 15%

'It's a combination of the strength of the pound against many currencies we like to take our winter breaks in, coupled with local hoteliers and tourist businesses fighting for our holiday spending money by slashing prices in resort for everything from eating out to entrances to popular attractions.

'Ensuring you get your slice of winter sun need not cost you the earth.

'In fact it's the earth you may well be exploring knowing your money will go a long way in the likes of Sri Lanka and other destinations near and far this winter.' 

Currently £1 (based on an exchange of £500) will buy 1.232 euros compared to 1.14 euros last October, an increase of around eight per cent in the past 12 months.

The strong value of the pound means savings for those heading further afield, such as the Dominican Republic

In Rodney Bay, St Lucia, the cost of those travel 'basket' items will set you back £105.88 - down 12% from 2013

The strong value of Sterling against several currencies means those heading further afield can save money on trips to Thailand, the Dominican Republic and St Lucia.

The tropical Island of Phuket, Thailand, has seen resort prices drop eight per cent with a family meal costing £52.44, a bottle of cola 55p and a glass of wine £3.05.

In Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, where prices have fallen three per cent, a cup of coffee costs just under a pound with a meal at £88.62 and alcohol slightly moire pricey with a glass of wine at £6.12.

At Rodney Bay, St Lucia, where prices have fallen 12 per cent, a cup of coffee costs £1.62, a bottle of lager £2.25 and a family meal with wine £86.10.

The only destinations where prices have risen out of the 12 were Dubai and Orlando, Florida.

Prices have actually risen in Orlando, Florida, USA, where costs are up 17% from last year

In Jumeirah, Dubai, prices have likewise increased, with the eight travel items now totaling £159.34

Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'Families can look forward to seeing their holiday money stretch further in winter sun Eurozone resorts as well as in many of the popular long haul destinations we surveyed for autumn half term holidays.

'The trick is do some advance holiday homework and pick a destination where resort prices are low and where the pound still packs a powerful punch.

'That's certainly true of resorts in Spain, Portugal and Cyprus, thanks to the strength of sterling, and people planning trips further afield can benefit from low resort charges in Sri Lankan resorts and the perennial favourite Phuket.' 

A three-course evening meal  will set you back a whopping £115.23 in Dubai - though the views are lovely

Sean Tipton, spokesman for travel association Abta, said: 'With half term rapidly approaching the strength of the pound makes a foreign break really good value for money.

'Not many people travel overseas in the autumn so hotels will lower their prices and you won't have to put up with the crowds you see in the summer.

'Plus if you're looking for good weather temperatures in Southern Europe and Turkey are still in the mid-twenties with good sunshine, so the beach is still an option.'
