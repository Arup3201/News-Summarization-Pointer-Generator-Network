A teenager who was on the books of League Two football club Stevenage FC drowned after falling into a filthy hotel swimming pool while on holiday in the Cypriot party town of Ayia Napa.  

Savvakis Alexandros Georgiou was on holiday visiting family on the sun-kissed island when he went back to the Kalypso Hotel on August 17.

The 18-year-old, from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, had been partying with pals through the night but is believed to have slipped and fallen into the pool as the party continued at the hotel in the early hours of August 18.

A spokesman for Stevenage FC today confirmed that the teenager was on its books and played for one of its academy teams.

Despite there being more than 20 people in the swimming pool, nobody spotted that he was in trouble until a female swimmer tripped over his body at the bottom of the pool.

It is believed he was under water for between five and 20 minutes and that nobody spotted him because the pool covered in algae and littered with rubbish, including syringes, condoms and cigarette butts.

Several people tried to revive the teen, but he was pronounced dead at Famagusta Hospital with a post-mortem confirming that he had drowned.

The teen had travelled to Ayia Napa with his cousin on August 17 after visiting his grandparents for four days in nearby Protaras, just five miles away.

The teen had initially booked into the Fedra hotel on August 14, but was told there had been a booking mistake and he was told he would have to stay in its sister hotel, The Kalypso.

Speaking this week, the teen's aunt Angela Soteriou, 39, said an independent forensic coroner had said the swimming pool was 'murky and littered with rubbish'.

Horrific: It is believed Savvakis was under water for between five and 20 minutes and that nobody spotted him because the pool covered in algae and littered with rubbish

She said: 'The water was filthy. No one could see him because no one could see the bottom of the pool. We believe that had the pool been clean he may have been seen earlier.'

She added: 'It is just so devastating. It's a tragedy. He was an athletic, bright and intelligent boy.

'He was an inspiration and so full of life and mischief. He was just so special, so loving. He had a good heart. If you asked him anything at all he would do it for you. He shouldn't be gone, he should be here. He had his whole life ahead of him. It's a tragic, tragic loss.'

A statement put out from his family warning of unregulated hotels, states: 'On behalf of Savvakis Alexandros Georgiou, parents Elbida and George Georgiou.

'I would like to make everyone (mothers fathers brothers sisters etc) aware of the tragic death of their 18 year old son, Savvakis Alexandros Georgiou, who lost his life on Monday 18th August 2014 between the hours of 7:00-8:00am leaving behind his brothers Andronico and Stefano.

'Savvakis lost consciousness after slipping into the algae ridden swimming pool which was filled with syringes, condoms and cigarette butts.

'This resulted in his body not being visible for approximately 20 minutes, which inevitably led to him drowning. Clear visibility perhaps could have saved his life.

'The original booking was made at the Fedra hotel apartments. Upon arrival they were informed that the hotel was fully booked and were referred to Kalypso, which are operating without the legally required licenses.

'As per local TV news, Kalypso, having submitted their applications since 2013, had not as yet received approval from the Cyprus Tourism Organisation to operate the hotel.

'Neither had they received approval from the local council to open the swimming pool to the public.

'On the one hand the hotel continues to welcome unsuspecting holiday makers, into their illegally operating premises. On the other hand, none of the responsible authorities have taken any further measures in closing them down.'

The 194-room hotel, which cost as little as £15-a-night and has four swimming pools - one indoor and three outdoor - is slated for being 'dirty and scary' with the swimming pools said to be 'murky and filthy', on Trip Advisor

An investigation has been launched into the death and the owners of the hotel, a father and son aged 63 and 33, were arrested on suspicion of not holding the proper hotel and pool permits.

They have been released without charge as the investigation continues. 

The girlfriend of Savvakis  - known as Sav - said she would do anything to have her boyfriend back in her arms again.

Mercedes Cole wrote on a tribute site to the teen after his body was flown back to the UK for his wake and funeral.

She wrote: 'All I am able to say is I had the world's best boyfriend and would do absolutely anything to be back in his arms MY beautiful angel.'

After visiting his body on Monday, she wrote: 'I can't explain how beautiful my angel looks sleeping.

'Seeing him today was the most unforgettable day of my life.

'I was just waiting for him to squeeze my hand back, open his eyes and look into mine or respond to my 'I love you'. He looked as peaceful as ever, just as if he was sleeping next to me!

'I can't wait to see you one day my beautiful person. I'll love you forever and always.'

The teen had travelled to Ayia Napa with his cousin on August 17 after visiting his grandparents for four days in nearby Protaras, just five miles away

The 18-year-old's funeral will take place on Wednesday September 3 at the The Greek Orthodox Church of St John the Baptist in Hornsey, north London, and he will be buried at Southgate Cemetery. 

School pal Mikey Michael paid tribute to his pal, writing: 'What can be said about Sav that we don't already know.

'He was a cheeky chappy with a heart of gold. His sense of humour and personality will always be remembered.

'Sav, you will be missed. May your family and loved ones have the strength during this difficult time. Your memory will live in us forever. Rest in peace.|

Another friend, Jordan Bell wrote: 'Sav...I don't know where to start, bro.

'I know for a fact that for me and the boys, the news hasn't really sunk in yet, we've all cried but not really accepted it.

'Some days are worse than others and it's hard for everyone to be positive.

'You know I'm not religious but I'm starting to think as a group we are all blessed to have the support of each other and indeed, blessed to have had you for a short while.

'Just make sure you sleep well mate because once the rest of us arrive up there, there will be no time to rest.

'Goodnight, bro, god bless x.'

Friend Anna Elizabeth Michael wrote: 'Anyone who knew and loved Sav knows his love of Chelsea.

'It's my idea that anyone who wants to acknowledges this on Wednesday in the smallest way, be it a badge, a scarf or even earrings in the blue and white colours of Chelsea Football Club.

'I'll be painting my nails. I just feel like it's something he'd appreciate and another way of letting him know wherever he is how much we love him x.'

The hotel is one of the worst in the whole island of Cyprus, according to Trip Advisor.

It comes in 100th place out of 104 hotels reviewed, with 55 out of 87 guests giving it the lowest possible 'terrible' ranking on Trip Advisor.

The 194-room hotel, which cost as little as £15-a-night and has four swimming pools - one indoor and three outdoor - is slated for being 'dirty and scary' with the swimming pools said to be 'murky and filthy'.

It is now known yet which swimming pool the 18-year-old, who went to St Mary's High School in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, drowned in.
