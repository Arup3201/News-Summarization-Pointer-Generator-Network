A scientific breakthrough could finally make a male contraceptive pill reality, researchers said last night.

Previous attempts to develop a pill have tried either to alter a man’s hormones or to make his sperm ineffective.

The new technique works like a 
temporary vasectomy, stopping sperm leaving the body during sex – which 
scientists say will reassure men concerned that other approaches could 
affect their long-term virility and libido.

Male pill? A temporary vasectomy, which stops sperm in its tracks without the need for surgery, is finally on the cards after years of research

It
 is also likely to appeal to women uneasy about the female pill’s 
potential to raise the risk of heart attacks, strokes and blood clots.

But
 some women may not welcome the news. In 2011 a survey by Anglia Ruskin 
University found that half of women would not rely on a male pill as 
contraception – because they did not trust their partners to remember to
 take it. Dr Sabatino Ventura, whose team at the Monash University in 
Australia published their findings last night, said the technique works 
by blocking two proteins involved in the ejaculation process.

Using
 medication to target the mechanism by which sperm leaves the body, 
rather than trying to alter a man’s hormones or kill his sperm, meant 
the potential side-effects would be vastly reduced, he said.

Significantly,
 the technique would not affect a man’s sex drive, and fertility could 
be switched back on simply by not taking the pill. Dr Ventura said: 
‘Most of the previous strategies to make a male contraceptive have 
either been hormonal strategies, which would produce a lot of sexual 
side-effects or effects on masculinity, or they would make sperm 
dysfunctional, which might produce long-term effects on offspring. Our 
strategy avoids all those problems.’

Taken
 daily, a male pill would let couples share the task of family planning.
 Although there are a range of contraception options available to women,
 for men currently there are only condoms or a permanent surgical 
vasectomy.

The new 
technique, detailed in a paper published in the Proceedings of the 
National Academy of Sciences, has been shown to work in mice.

The
 male mice were 100 per cent infertile after two proteins were deleted 
from their bodies. Crucially, the sperm retained in their body was 
undamaged and was later used via IVF to produce healthy baby mice

Women still appreciate chivalry from men, according to a study.

More than four out of five like it when a man holds a door open, and three quarters like to be offered a seat, a survey found. 

Nearly two thirds like men to pull out their chair at a meal.

Men were less keen, however. More than a third said they were unlikely to help a woman carry heavy bags or a pushchair up stairs. And 21 per cent said they would be too embarrassed to give up a seat, with some fearing being seen as patronising. 

Only 7 per cent of women said they disliked such behaviour. 

Reviewing the research, psychologist Donna Dawson said: ‘There seems to be a “disconnect” between what women appreciate . . . and how men think women want to be treated.’

The survey of 5,000 people was carried out for insurer AXA.

In
 humans the same process would work by using medication to disrupt the 
same two proteins, blocking a message from the brain which moves sperm 
into the penis. The man would still ejaculate but there would be no 
sperm.

Dr Allan Pacey, 
fertility expert at Sheffield University, said the study showed great 
promise but added: ‘There is a long way to go. We need to do a few 
studies in humans to be sure this works in the way it has in mice and 
there are no side-effects.’
