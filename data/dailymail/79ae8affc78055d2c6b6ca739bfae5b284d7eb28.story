Seasoned cricket observers in England can be forgiven if they are scratching their heads and struggling to recognise many of the names in India’s touring party.

Even us Indian fans barely know who some of the players are. This must be, by some distance, the most inexperienced Indian squad to have toured England for several decades.

Only three of them have played Test cricket here before, and they now find themselves facing a full five-match series in England for the first time since 1959.

In fact the last occasion India played five Tests against anyone was back in 2002, when the grizzled old captain MS Dhoni was still three years away from his debut.

It is a far cry from the collection of ‘galacticos’ – Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman et al – who last toured here in 2011. That ageing team, which arrived as the world No 1, suffered the humiliation of a 4-0 whitewash that marked a violent end to the dominance of India’s golden generation.

If even that star-studded side capitulated so horribly in English conditions, then some may ask what hope there is for the current crop? Including that tour three years ago, India have been defeated in all of their last four away Test series, losing 10 of the 12 matches played.

Little wonder then that the media-averse coach Duncan Fletcher, in one of the few pronouncements he will make all summer, was keen to label his charges as youthful and inexperienced underdogs.

But the wily old strategist, who has been allowed to continue developing a new generation of players despite the sequence of poor results, also raised the suggestion ‘they might fire from this series’ onwards.

The new star: Virat Kohli typifies the loud and brash nature of the modern India

While he was careful not to mention it, he has no doubt taken huge encouragement from England’s own dreadful tally of losing six of their last seven Tests.

In reality, this is a series between two rather weak sides that are still struggling to reinvent themselves after the sudden loss of several very fine players, whether through retirement, ill-health or ill-discipline.

And the main cause of India’s torment three years ago – a disciplined and relentless bowling unit led by Jimmy Anderson at the peak of his powers – is looking nothing like the force it was back then.

At the very least, there should be enough strength in India’s traditional virtue – its batting  – to avoid a repeat of the 2011 whitewash.

Their first aim will be to avert defeat in the opening two Tests at Trent Bridge and Lord’s, where the bowling conditions are often very much to England’s liking. As the series goes on, and if we do indeed experience the long and hot summer tentatively promised by weather forecasters, then the pitches will become more like the dustbowls the Indians know back home.

Legends: Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid (right) were the bedrock of India's fearsome batting line-up

The batting hopes will rest, in particular, on the shoulders of two men who may eventually go some distance towards emulating the great names they have succeeded.

Cheteshwar Pujara, a classical technician who looks like he was born to play Test cricket, is the natural heir to Rahul Dravid in the No 3 slot. With a batting average close to 60 from his 19 Tests, he has scored centuries against all five nations he has faced, including an unbeaten double hundred against England.

While Pujara is something of a throwback to a bygone era, the other key batsman – Virat Kohli – typifies the brash and loud nature of modern India.

Like several of his colleagues, he was a multi-millionaire and domestic celebrity before he had even played a single Test match - purely on the back of some big hitting in ODIs and the IPL. Many traditionalists probably took quiet satisfaction when Kohli initially struggled in the longer and more difficult form of the great game.

But despite his rather blingy outward appearance, he has a furious work ethic and his Test average is now in the high 40s and still rising. He is starting to become a worthy holder of the number four slot vacated by Sachin Tendulkar’s retirement.

There is also considerable talent elsewhere in the batting line-up, at least on the evidence of shorter forms of cricket, although it has yet to prove itself consistently in the five-day version.

The openers Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan have shown genuine signs of promise, but they failed to post a single stand of 50 in their last eight attempts. The recall of veteran opener Gautam Gambhir, whose last international appearance was 18 months ago, indicates all is not right at the top of the Indian order.

Lower down the order the stylish Rohit Sharma, who scored centuries in his first two Test innings, deserves to keep his place despite a subsequent dip in form. Ajinkya Rahane and the spinning all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja have also shown they can perform if handed the final batting slot.

But to raise their ambitions and actually win a match or two, India will have to take 20 wickets. And it is here that the weaknesses in the squad really begin to show.

In their warm-up matches they failed to make proper inroads into the batting line-up of not only Leicestershire but also a Derbyshire side placed second bottom in the second division that chose to field many 2nd XI players.

The Indian pace attack, if it can be so called, will be led in the experience stakes by the shaggy-haired beanpole Ishant Sharma. He is accurate and generates good bounce but is yet to develop into a true match-winner and fulfil the huge promise he showed as a teenage debutant.

The more likely source of wickets is Mohammed Shami, who has demonstrated in his six Tests that he has a precise radar and can move the ball – attributes suited to bowling in England.

His new-ball partner Bhuvneshwar Kumar has similar qualities and also the useful knack of taking early wickets when there is plenty of swing in the air, but perhaps lacks the pace to do damage once the cherry has lost its shine.

There is serious speed, however, in the form of Varun Aaron, who has regularly been clocked above 90mph.

Nobody puts him in the shade: Kohli is India's main man with the bat

He can also trouble batsmen with movement if he lands the ball in the right place. The only problem is that he doesn’t do so very often.

Much may depend on whether Fletcher – so familiar with English conditions – can get these and any other seamers he uses to capitalise on whatever help there is from the pitches and climate.

It is difficult to forecast how much Fletcher will use the lead spinner, Ravichandran Ashwin, particularly in the opening matches. While often deadly at home, he failed to take a single wicket and conceded 108 runs in the sole away Test away he was selected for, in South Africa, in the last two years.

The lack of penetration and experience among the bowlers means India may choose to adopt a cautious and realistic approach for much of the series rather than going for all-out attack.

On their recent winter tours to South Africa and New Zealand, they got into several winning positions and competed until the end before ultimately losing both series 1-0. They will probably be pleased with their summer’s work if a similar pattern is repeated in England.

But the victory of a similarly unheralded Sri Lanka team in the two-Test series last month shows there are rewards on offer for holding greater ambition and optimism.

If they manage to weather the seamer-friendly conditions of the first two Tests and go into the final games with a fighting chance of a series victory, then India may yet prevail in what is likely to be a tight battle between two young sides still undergoing a process of transition.
