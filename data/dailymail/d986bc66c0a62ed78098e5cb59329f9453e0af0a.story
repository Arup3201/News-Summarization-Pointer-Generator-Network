Rio Ferdinand is said to be ‘furious’, ‘seething’ and ‘very angry’ at his latest Football Association fine and ban. He is also said, by ‘a close source’, to feel victimised, picked upon and singled out for special punishment by the people who control the English game. 

He is therefore, we are told, considering withdrawing his support for future FA initiatives.

Outrage, resentment, revenge: it was an average week in the life of QPR’s occasional central defender.

Rio Ferdinand was banned for three games and fined £25,000 for controversial 'sket' tweet

His offence was to post a deeply offensive message on Twitter, the spiritual home of deeply offensive messages. Replying to a Manchester United fan, who suggested that QPR needed to sign a new centre-back, Ferdinand wrote: ‘Get ya mum in, plays the field well son! #sket’.

The world now knows that ‘sket’ is Jamaican slang for a loose woman. The world has yet to comprehend the mind which can blurt out that vile response to a daft little jibe.

The FA have not always coped impressively with questions of discipline but this time they seem to have struck precisely the correct balance.

Aware that football has genuine problems with sexism issues, and aware that Ferdinand has a Twitter following of almost six million, they handed down an exemplary sentence of a three-game ban, a £25,000 fine and an order to attend an education programme. It was a timely expression of disapproval and an important statement of principle.

Here we might remember just what an extraordinary player Ferdinand has been. He captained his country, won 81 caps and proved himself one of the finest footballing central defenders English football has known.

He played in six Premier League-winning sides at Manchester United, with whom he won the Champions League. In short, he was a marvellous player and the English game has yet to discover his successor.

But in Ferdinand’s case, the past tense is inevitable. On Friday, he will be 36 years old and his future at the top level is clearly limited. It had seemed likely that he would move on to an important administrative role, especially when he was chosen to serve on Greg Dyke’s commission into the future of English football.

Yet always there was a disturbing unpredictability. In 2003 he served an eight-month suspension for missing a drugs test. Then there was his despicable Twitter outburst in 2012, when he appeared to endorse a tweet which referred to Ashley Cole as a ‘choc ice’ after Cole had given evidence in a high-profile trial.

Cole may not be everyone’s idea of a model citizen, but he did not deserve such a wicked racial slur. Ferdinand was fined £45,000 for that transgression and while his own sense of self-importance seemed resolutely undaunted, even his erstwhile admirers were becoming increasingly critical.

His most recent offence seems miserably typical, despite the efforts of his fawning chums to search out helpful precedents. We are told, for instance, that the FA allowed the Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore to go unpunished for his tawdry email exchanges. 

In Scudamore’s case, it was argued that these were private communications which were never intended for public viewing.

More recently, we had the attention-seeking irritant Joey Barton, a QPR colleague of Ferdinand, tweeting a moronic sexual slur on the Barcelona players Neymar and Messi.

No measures have yet been instigated against Barton and the FA may well decide that by far the most wounding course of action would be to ignore him.

All of which leaves Ferdinand with a decision. He can opt for arrogant indignation: nursing his grievances, witholding whatever useful influence he possesses and seeking to settle scores with his interminable tweeting. Or he can choose the difficult alternative, which involves ignoring the sycophants and taking a hard look at himself.

I have no idea which course he will adopt, although his initial laddish truculence seems faintly ominous: ‘Is humour even allowed … I’m baffled. Ludicrous…’

But I do hope he does not cast himself adrift. For all his mistakes and fumbling misdeeds, Rio Ferdinand may yet have a good deal to offer English football. 

Sure, he has bridges to mend and a reputation to restore but memories are short and his potential is considerable. Accepting the FA punishment without comment or complaint might be a good place to start.

Northern Dave has found his voice again 

Welcome back, Dave Whelan, distinguished chairman of Wigan Athletic. For too long, the parody of the professional Northerner has seemed reluctant to address the nation. At last, his silence has been broken.

We used to hear a lot from Dave; too much, some thought. You will recall his enlightened views on football and race: ‘I just think we should forget colour and, you know, it doesn’t bother anybody, I’m sure. When they’re playing at such a level, the stress is there. And if they call somebody white, if they call somebody black, you’ve just got to get on with it.’

There was his contentious, though ultimately unheeded, request for the whole of English football to observe a minute’s silence to mark the demise of Margaret Thatcher.

Then his suggestion that the England national team be coached by a combination of Paul Jewell and Stuart Pearce. He always had grave doubts about foreigners, did Dave: ‘You need four or five British players in any [club] squad to give it some heart and depth,’ he said. ‘They also give you leadership and they fight to the death.’

But of one thing Dave was quite certain: he did not like Mike Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United and a man once seen as a threat to Dave’s authority in the northern sports goods business. Whelan is famously reported to have told Ashley: ‘There’s a club in the North, son. And you’re not part of it.’

The warning went unheeded as Ashley prompted a series of investigations into the way the industry was conducted. Whelan’s company incurred an £8million fine.

Dave never forgave that expensive affront. Some time later, after Ashley had bought Newcastle, Whelan remarked: ‘He [Ashley] turned up in the boardroom in a pair of jeans, a pair of trainers and a replica shirt. He’s got no class whatsoever.’

Having built his own fortune upon trainers and replica shirts, it seemed a curious complaint.

Newcastle owner Ashley acquired a 10 per cent stake in Glasgow Rangers last week

Hostilities were resumed last week, following news that Ashley had acquired a 10 per cent stake in Glasgow Rangers. Dave was suspicious.

‘If I was [a Rangers fan] and a stranger from England started buying my club, I’d be worried,’ he said. ‘I’d ask myself, “Has he got Rangers Football Club at heart?” It’s like me and Wigan Athletic, I am Wigan through and through and I’ll do anything I can for them. It’s that kind of owner that supporters want.’

Then, without a word of warning, he played his joker and astounded us all. Aware of idle speculation that Ashley hopes one day to move the club into England’s Premier League, Whelan declared: ‘It would great for the Premier League if they extended the league, don’t put anybody out, and bring Celtic and Rangers in.’

So there! According to Whelan, the richest league in Europe would somehow be enhanced by the addition of a desperately ordinary Celtic team and a Rangers side currently second in the Scottish Championship. 

Some would dismiss that as a piece of addled absurdity. They do well to remember that a wise man was speaking. And we are richer for Dave’s wisdom.

Getting to grips with evil at last

A good week for the football authorities. Not only did the Football Association deal decisively with Rio Ferdinand but the Scottish FA imposed a seven-match ban upon Celtic’s Aleksandar Tonev for racially abusing the Aberdeen defender Shay Logan.

Tonev has lodged an appeal against the verdict but, as things stand, it seems a salutary sentence for an unacceptable offence.

In the past, the various powers-that-be have tended to deflect such issues by mumbling trite platitudes about ‘harmless banter’ and ‘what happens on the field, stays on the field’.

No longer. These days, the evil is confronted and punished. And we all become slightly more civilised as a result.

PS 

The hucksters who run Formula One are concerned that their championship is losing its appeal. 

They have therefore decided to spice things up by introducing a game-show gimmick: double points will be awarded for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the final race of the season, on November 23. 

This is rather like announcing that all goals will count double in the final week of the football season, or that the value of runs will be doubled for the final Test of a series. 

Rather like motor racing itself, it has everything to do with commercial calculation and little to do with sport. This tacky wheeze is apparently the brainchild of Bernie Ecclestone. Why are we not surprised?
