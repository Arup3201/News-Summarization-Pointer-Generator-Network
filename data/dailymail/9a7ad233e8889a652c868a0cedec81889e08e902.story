Manuela Rodriguez attempted to take her own life using the power saw after allegedly murdering her granddaughter, Rose Herrera

A Chicago woman has been charged in the killing of her 7-month-old granddaughter, who had her throat cut with a power saw after being suffocated with a sock and beaten to death.

Police have said the baby girl, Rose Herrera, was killed Monday, apparently because she would not stop crying.

The Cook County State's Attorney's Office said Tuesday that the baby's 52-year-old grandmother, Manuela Rodriguez, was charged with first-degree murder in baby Rose's death.

An autopsy concluded that the baby was already dead when her throat was slashed.

It also found that not only was the girl struck in the head with an object, but that she also likely suffocated on a sock that was ‘placed in her mouth,’ according to a county medical examiner's log that includes the infant's death.

Rodriguez, who police say attempted to take her own life after the attack, was taken to a hospital for treatment for injuries that were not considered life threatening.

The State's Attorney's Office said Rodriguez is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. 

Police were called at around 9.40am to a multi-family home in the 2800 block of South Avers Avenue in the Little Village section of Chicago, where they discovered the lifeless body of the infant with 'visible trauma.'

The child was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators said before the suspect took a circular saw to the child's body, she tried to quiet her down by stuffing a sock down her throat.

Following the  killing, Manuela Rodriguez reportedly attempted to take her own life. She was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in a stable condition. 

Residents of the quiet street in the predominantly Hispanic Little Village neighborhood where Rose was killed said the Rodriguez had some health problems but was always pleasant.

State child welfare officials said they had no record of ever being called to the brick home.

Neighbors said the woman and her family were always polite and did not cause trouble.

‘She would help everybody and if you needed a glass of milk or something she would give it to you,’ said Maria Gentil, who has known Rodriguez for several years and said she was a doting grandmother. ‘When my mother died, she went up and down the street asking for money for her funeral.’

Ben Llamas works with the child's father and drove him to the scene. Mr Llamas told the Chicago Tribune the father was upset but did not talk about what happened.

His friend had moved in to that house about a year ago with a woman, Llamas said. The couple had a young child.

‘At first, he was reluctant, but when the baby came, he fell in love,’ Llamas said. ‘He shows us pictures of that baby every day.’

Neighbors said several people live in the home where the baby was found.

‘They were really good people,’ Francisco Arreola told the Chicago Tribune in Spanish. ‘I would always see them and they were very happy. I never heard them fight or anything.’
