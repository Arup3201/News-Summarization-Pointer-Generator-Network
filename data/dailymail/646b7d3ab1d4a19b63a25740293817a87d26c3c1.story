David Cameron is 'turning a blind eye' to tax avoidance according to Ed Miliband who vowed to investigate wealthy firms who dodge paying billions of pounds.

The Labour leader said the rich should play by the same rules as the poor and accused the Coalition of 'shrugging its shoulders over tax avoidance'.

In a speech to a party conference in Swansea he promised to stage an 'aggressive' review into Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) – if he were to win May's general election.

Mr Miliband said the Government had failed to close loopholes that allow companies to be registered in tax havens such as Jersey and the Cayman Islands.

It comes in the  same week a political row broke out over claims the British bank HSBC helped wealthy clients avoid or evade tax through its Swiss private banking arm.

'In Britain today we risk having one rule for the rich and powerful and another for everybody else,' said Mr Miliband.

'What we are seeing is the growth of hugely complex and aggressive tax avoidance schemes, often based offshore.

'The sort of activity that has left the United Kingdom a £34 billion hole in our nation's finances.

'That's why we have to act. Because this Government has simply shrugged its shoulders over tax avoidance. It has failed to take action on tax havens.

'All kinds of businesses find HMRC chases them for every penny they owe, but they suspect there are sweetheart deals with a few of the largest, multinational companies that aren't paying their fair share.'

Prime Minister David Cameron was accused of 'turning a blind eye' to tax avoidance

The Labour leader has spent the week lambasting ‘tax dodgers’ in the wake of the HSBC scandal, but he has also faced questions over his own family’s practices.

Mr Miliband and his family used a ‘deed of variation’ to divide the ownership of the family home in North London

These legal documents – which change the terms of someone’s will after they have died – are used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills in a legal form of tax avoidance. 

Mr Miliband said his proposed probe could have full investigatory powers and support from the Treasury as well reporting directly to the Chancellor.

He told delegates: 'While this Government has had five years of inaction, we will begin from the first days we are in government and it will report within three months.

'We will ensure we are a country where there is responsibility from top to bottom.

'The Government's failure to tackle tax avoidance is no accident.

'It has turned a blind eye to tax avoidance because it thinks that so long as a few at the top do well, the country succeeds.

'It thinks that wealth and power fence people off from responsibility. It thinks the rules only apply to everybody else.

'We will act because we have a different vision of how our country succeeds. It doesn't matter how much I get attacked for this, I'm not backing down.

'I will stand up to all those who stand in the way of success for working families.'

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls welcomed his party leader's comments.

He added: 'We will close the loopholes, increase transparency and toughen up penalties.

'But we also need HMRC to do a much better job. This review of HMRC's culture and practices in the first weeks of a Labour government is so vital.

'HMRC needs to be fit for purpose and this review will help us make it so.'

The Conservatives laughed off Labour's proposals - saying their rivals could not be trusted with the economy.

A party spokesman said: 'The culture and practices of HMRC went wrong under Labour - when top bankers paid lower tax rates than their cleaners, foreigners didn't pay capital gains tax and the richest people routinely avoided paying stamp duty.

'It's David Cameron who has been clearing up Labour's mess - investing in HMRC to increase the number of prosecutions of tax dodgers, putting reform of the way multinational companies are taxed at the top of the G8 agenda and closing loopholes that the richest were exploiting under Labour.

'So the question for Ed Miliband is whether this inquiry would include Labour's record during the age of irresponsibility that he was at the heart of.'
