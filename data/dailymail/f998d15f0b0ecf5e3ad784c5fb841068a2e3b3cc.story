Police in Georgia are hunting for a thief who made off with a 10ft-tall, 300lb metal rooster installed outside a local business.

Bonnie Harris, who owns Lexington Vintage in Athens, reported the crime to authorities on Saturday morning after she discovered the colorful animal sculpture had gone. 

She also launched an appeal via social media.

Because the rooster was worth an estimated $3,000, the culprit could face felony charges with a maximum of ten years in jail.

Harris told The Athens Banner-Herald that the rooster's installation two weeks ago involved anchoring it into the ground with rebar stakes.

She said her husband thinks some type of tool was used to cut the big bird away because part of one foot was left in the ground.

It's believed the burglary occurred sometime between Friday night and Saturday morning.

Harris, who opened her store last November, said she was 'angry' and 'saddened' by the theft because the rooster was a one-of-a-kind, specially commissioned piece.

The mascot earned the nickname Rocket the Rusty Rooster.

She hopes that the structure is still intact and has been sold as scrap metal.

'I hope it is somebody who recognized, "hey this is a really cool piece of art" and they took it impulsively and would see this and bring it back,' the business owner told CBS News.

Anyone with information on the rooster's whereabouts is asked to call the Athens-Clarke Police Department at 706 613 3888.
