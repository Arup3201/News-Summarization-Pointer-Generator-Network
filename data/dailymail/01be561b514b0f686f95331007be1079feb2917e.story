Tiny victim: A driver opened fire on a family car in South Houston, injuring three-year-old Leah in the leg

A three-year-old girl has been shot in the leg as she traveled in her family's car in South Houston.

In what police are calling an incident of road rage, a driver opened fire on the family car on Saturday night around 10:30pm.

Little Leah was a passenger in the back of her mother and father's SUV along with her one-year-old brother.

As the family of four drove down south Allen-Genoa near Avenue A, they noticed a car weaving between the lanes.

Fearful
 the driver was drunk and could cause an accident, Leah's father, who 
was driving, sped up to overtake the swerving driver.

'They
 just thought they would pass it up on suspicion that this may have been
 a drunk driver,' South Houston Police Chief Herbert Gilbert told KTRK.

Leah's
 father says that as he tried to pull away from the erratic driver, he 
fired three shots that hit the car just inches from where the children 
were sitting.

As Leah's father tried to speed away, the other driver pulled level with the family and fired off five more shots.

KRTK 
reports that the rear window of the family's SUV shattered as the 
bullets hit. Another hit the steering wheel, and another hit 
three-year-old Leah, grazing her leg.

The shooter then sped away from the scene.

Riddled: The car driven by Leah's father has three bullet holes visible in its rear, just inches from where the girl and her little brother were sitting

The
 traumatized family is now rallying around Leah, who spent her Easter in
 the hospital receiving treatment, instead of hunting for chocolate eggs
 like most three-year-olds.

Police are now searching for the suspect, whose reckless action could have killed the family.

'We do have word that there may have been other witnesses and we do want to reach out to those witnesses,' said Chief Herbert. 'Please have them come forward.'

According to witnesses, the suspect was driving a white car with rims on it.
