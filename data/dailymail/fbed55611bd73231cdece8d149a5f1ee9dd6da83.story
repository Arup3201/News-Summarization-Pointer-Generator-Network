Tragic: Marissa Wilmoth, seven, was killed in her own backyard by a wooden jungle gym

A seven-year-old girl was killed in her own backyard when a beam from the wooden jungle gym she was playing on fell on her head.

Police told local authorities that Marissa Wilmoth, who has a twin sister, was climbing on the play set when it collapsed, sending a beam to her head.

Sheriffs have now launched an investigation to see whether or not the jungle gym was properly assembled.

Marissa, who was one of five children, was rushed to Cookeville Regional Medical Centre after the accident, but later died.

Parents Roger and Mary Alice Wilmoth were devastated, and were seen Friday at a private visitation service looking tearful and sombre, Fox News reported.

Detectives working with the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office in Nashville, Tennessee, said the wooden play set was not anchored into the ground.

However, they said that even if the jungle gym had been properly anchored, the accident still would have happened.

According to the police report, Marissa was playing on the set in their backyard with some of her siblings.

The girl’s funeral was held Saturday in Cookeville at the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Tom Stricket, who sells and assembles play sets at Happy Backyards told hinterlandgazette.com that parents must be careful when selecting and installing jungle gyms.

‘If you’re looking to build your own playground at home, I would certainly contact someone like me or a professional carpenter,’ he said.

Experts recommend checking children’s play sets regularly for damage or flaws, and particularly for signs of weathering.

Wood play sets are subject to the elements, termites, and rotting.
