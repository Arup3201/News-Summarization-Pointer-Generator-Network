James Rajasurirar has had brain surgery and is in a medically induced coma following the attack

An argument between two teenage girls is believed to have led to a vicious attack on an unarmed man who is fighting for his life in hospital. 

James Rajasurirar, 22, was beaten unconscious by the gang wielding metal poles and wooden bats in Chipping Norton in Sydney's south west. 

Now the victim's heartbroken mum Carol has told her son's attackers to stop being 'cowards' and own up.

Police say the attack is believed to have been sparked by an ongoing dispute between two teenage girls.

Both girls allegedly arrived at the scene with a number of friends, including Mr Rajasurirar, who was hit from behind with a club or baton in Boolarong Avenue in the early hours of Tuesday.

The gang then attacked the other four members of the unarmed group with bats and metal poles while continuing to beat an unconscious Mr Rajasurirar on the ground.

'His friends all love him. He'd do anything for his friends,' Ms Rajasurirar said.

'Who would do that to a person? I don't understand why.'

'Both parties please just do this (come forward) for James.'

In addition to a fractured and lacerated skull, Mr Rajasurirar also sustained a neck injury, fractured ribs and doctors now suspect he may also have kidney damage.

Police released this image of Mr Rajasurirar's skull showing where he was hit over the head 

He remains in a stable but critical condition in a medically-induced coma after undergoing brain surgery at Liverpool Hospital.

Police said they have received statements from two people involved but are waiting to hear from the others who were there.

It is believed the people from the two groups were aged between 17 and 27.
