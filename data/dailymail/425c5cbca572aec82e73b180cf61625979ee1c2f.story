A Doberman had to have five golf balls removed from his stomach in an emergency operation - and some of them may have been trapped inside him for more than six months.

Worried owner Graham Saysell, 54, rushed Zac to the vets the day after he collapsed at home last month.

Mr Saysell had no idea the balls were there until he was shown an X-ray.

Emergency operation: Graham Saysell rushed his Doberman Zac to the vet after he fell ill - and discovered that he had five golf balls in his stomach

Vets believe the 18 month old dog ate the balls on five 
different occasions and had been walking around with them in his stomach
for up to six months.

Two of the balls were wedged in Zac's gut as his body tried to digest them and vets only gave him a 50/50 chance of survival.

But a two-hour long emergency operation to remove the balls from his stomach was a success and he has since returned home. He was in a critical condition for three days.

Mr Saysell rushed his Doberman to Heathcote Veterinary Centre in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, last month after he suddenly fell ill.

The father-of-four, who lives with his wife Rachel, 47, said: 'It would've been devastating if he had died because we lost another dog, Max, at this time last year.

'It's incredibly upsetting when your pet is ill because they can't tell you what is wrong. When you look at the size of the golf balls it amazes me he managed to swallow one let alone five.

'We call him Tiger Woofs now and my friends are always asking if he's feeling under par.'

Graham takes Zac, who weighs 40kg, on daily walks around the edge of Leamington and County Golf Club, near his home in Whitnash, Warkwickshire.

Graham, a former managing director of an automotive firm, said: 'I take Zac for a walk around the side of the golf course twice a day.

'Apparently he ate the balls over a period of about six months - which is quite amazing.

'It means he would have been walking around with these in his stomach for ages.

'But it only became a problem when two of them moved from his stomach into his gut.

'He was fine on the Friday before he fell ill but he started whimpering, vomiting, and could hardly move by the Sunday.

Golf ball 'treat': It is thought Zac swallowed the balls while being taken for walks around the Leamington and County Golf Club

'We had no idea what was wrong with him. We took him to the vets on Monday morning and they were extremely worried.

'So they took an X-ray and found he had five golf balls in his stomach. They operated immediately but it was very touch and go. The op almost killed him as they had to cut very close to his pancreas.

'Thankfully he has made a full recovery and seems to be more boisterous than ever.

'I still don't know why he likes to eat golf balls - he probably thinks they're treats.'

Vet Emily Emerson removed the balls from Zac's badly damaged gut - and said there were fears he may die.

She said: 'It's not common to find dogs eating odd objects but we do see it from time to time.

'I have removed socks, children's toys, needles and more from dogs in the past.

'Two of the balls had passed into the gut as the body tried to digest them which caused the blockage.

'We were not sure if he was going to make it at first but thankfully he pulled through.

'Dobermans are very tough dogs and his robustness helped him survive the ordeal.'
