Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere has showed off his culinary skills after posting a picture of some homemade bruschetta on his official Instagram account.

The 23-year-old was apparently very pleased with himself and triumphantly attached his name to the dish in the photo's caption along with the list of ingredients. 

His team-mate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, however, was not especially supportive of Wilshere's endeavors and mocked him on Twitter, 'Have a day off will Ya!! Jack's bruschetta. Who you trying to impress geez?!!'

The Arsenal midfielder has been out with an ankle injury he sustained in November last year

Wilshere has been nursing an ankle injury since November last year, but is expected to make his return to The Gunners' first-team for their Premier League game with Crystal Palace on Saturday. 

He is under intense pressure to impress and return to form after recently being caught in the third smoking scandal of his career. 

Having initially been touted as a long-term successor to erstwhile Arsenal playmaker Cesc Fabregas during his early days at the club, thanks to a mixture of injuries, inconsistency and several off-field controversies, Wilshere has seen his stock drop significantly over the last few years.

Indeed, there are some fans and pundits who suggest that it could be now or never for Wilshere to deliver for Arsenal, starting with the trip to Selhurst Park.  

After his latest smoking scandal, Wilshere is under intense pressure to perform well for The Gunners
