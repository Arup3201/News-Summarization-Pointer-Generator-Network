Tourists who bring their own parasols to popular beaches on the picturesque Thai island of Phuket are being forced to sit in designated areas under a pilot project announced this week.

Holidaymakers who take the ‘bring-your-own-umbrella’ approach will not be allowed to sit wherever they please amid ongoing complaints about ‘clutter’ on beaches.

Provincial officials are testing the idea of setting aside 10 per cent of space at each of the island’s most popular beaches for umbrellas and hired mats, Phuketwan reported.

The scheme will be tested first at Kata beach before it is rolled out at other beaches, including all of those in the Phuket city district.

Somkiet Sangkaosutthirak, Phuket’s vice-governor, and baffled tourists watched on Wednesday as officials marked an area measuring 32ft by 82ft.

Tourists who bring their own umbrellas will be confined to seven of the zones on Kata beach and each will have a kiosk where they can hire parasols and mats, but not sunloungers, Phuketwan reported.

Massage vendors will be allowed to operate within the designated zones.

Nisit Jansomwong, the region’s governor, wants to trial the scheme for three months before deciding whether to continue it.

In November, holidaymakers were left stunned and outraged when armed police officers raided Surin beach in Phuket to seize their personal parasols and sunloungers.

The incident occurred amid confusion about a local beach furniture ban that applied only to vendors.

It led to an angry confrontation with some holidaymakers arguing and refusing to take down their umbrellas.
