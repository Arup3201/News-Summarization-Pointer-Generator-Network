A Chilean miner stole the show at the World Pasty Championships by beating his Cornish competition.

Jorge Pereira won the open savoury amateur prize with his empanada Chilena, a traditional Chilean pasty made with beef, onion, hard-boiled egg, olives and sultanas.

Mr Pereira decided to take part in the contest while on a two-month visit to the UK to see his wife's family.

Wife Gail, who spoke on the non-English-speaking cook's behalf, said: 'Jorge feels very excited and happy to be so far from my country to win such a prize.

'It's all about getting recognition for his country rather than winning.'

There were also pasty makers from the US and Canada at the championships, held on Saturday at the Eden Project in Bodelva, Cornwall, to celebrate the British delicacy.

Betty Lethbridge, 88, from St Kew, Cornwall, who took the Cornish pasty amateur title, has been baking for eight decades.

But she only decided to enter this year at the behest of her son, Fisherman's Friends singer John Lethbridge.

She said: 'I'm shocked really, I didn't think for one minute I would win anything.

'I did it to please John. He said to me 'You make a good pasty, mother, why don't you enter?'

'I've been making them for years and years. I started when I was eight years old.

'Mother used to make pasties so I used to roll the pastry out on a bench. You need to get really good meat to make a pasty and the seasoning is important.'

Eden Project spokesman David Rowe said: 'The fourth World Pasty Championships was a very memorable one for sure and Mrs Lethbridge's win was such a heart-warming story.

'We commend the entrants who took so much pride in their pasties.

'To have pasty makers from the USA, Canada and Chile gave it a great international feel and there was a nice spread of entrants from different parts of the UK.' 

In the professional ranks, West Cornwall Pasty Company were came tops in the prestigious Cornish Pasty Company category.

Open Savoury Professional winner Luisa Ead from Padstow, Cornwall, scored 97 with a smoked haddock, white wine and mustard pasty while Daniel Beddoes,13, from Bristol, defended his title when he won the Open Savoury Junior category with a barbeque effort.

Marion Symonds, of Portreath Bakery in Redruth, Cornwalll, was handed the Pasty Ambassador award for her contribution to the Cornish Pasty Association and the industry.

Marion has been dubbed as 'mama pasty' in Mexico after she travelled the globe to promote the Cornish food.

Each pasty went under close scrutiny to pick the tastiest winner in each category at the competition
