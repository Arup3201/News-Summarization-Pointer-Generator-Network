Complaints about the horrible smell wafting from one California home led animal control to the grim discovery of more than 100 cats kept in filth

'All the cats are healthy and they’re fine,' she told a CBS13 reporter through her shut front door. 

'They were being transported somewhere.'

She claims she was taking them to shelters.

The cats remain in the custody of animal control as evidence. 

'Her belief is that she was doing the right thing,' said animal services officer Mark Schwarz. 

He said the house was filled with litter boxes, and a smell so terrible he needed a mask to breath inside. 

The smell lingers even with the animals removed, but Gerrard claims the cats sprayed because they were startled by the authorities

'When we talked with her, she basically said that she couldn’t smell anything, and nothing was wrong,' he said.

Neighbor Luke Curry said the odor from the cats was overpowering.

'We couldn’t open the windows to the house,' he said. 'It was a major, and still is a major problem.'

The smell lingers even with the animals removed, but Gerrard claims the cats sprayed because they were startled by the authorities.

'It smells because the cats were scared to death, and they urinated everywhere,' Gerrard said.
