Thousands of people around the world armed themselves with fluffy pillows as they revisited a childhood tradition and battled it out for International Pillow Fight Day.

For the sixth year in a row, Trafalgar Square was invaded for an hour this afternoon as Londoners let their inhibitions go and attacked strangers with gusto.

Some people got so enthusiastic about the event that their pillows ripped and feathers flew into the air. Others opted to observe the action from the sidelines, instead choosing to capture the unique occasion on film.

London was just one of more than 100 cities around the world to take part in the event - with similar sights spotted in Paris, New York, Zurich, Rome and Madrid.

Participants
 to the annual event, organised by Urban Playground Movement, were not 
allowed to hit anyone with a camera, or anyone not armed with a pillow.

The pillow fights are seen as a way to get people outside and relieve stress, organisersÂ  said.

Dozens of revellers took part in the mass pillow fight in Trafalgar Square, central London, this afternoon to mark International Pillow Fight Day. It is the sixth year in a row that people have turned out to take part in the flash mob pillow fight and revellers certainly seemed to be enjoying themselves as they got involved in the free event

London was just one of more than 100 cities around the world to take part in the event. People from Hong Kong to Paris, Madrid to Toronto and New York to Singapore also took part in celebrating the favourite childhood tradition. Organisers said the pillow fights are seen as a way to get people outside and relieve stress

Dozens of people congregated at Trafalgar Square in central London at around 3pm and thrashed it out with fellow pillow fight-goers until their arms ached. Traditionally, people usually move on to St James's Park after the event to relax and unwind

Some people got so enthusiastic about the event that their pillows ripped and feathers flew into the air. However, the rules state that participants are not allowed to hit anyone with a camera, or anyone not armed with a pillow

Many people wore fancy dress, colourful masks or costumes for the event which saw swarms of people descend on Trafalgar Square and bash each other with large fluffy pillows for around one hour

It was all too much for some participants who used their pillow as a shield after the pillow fighting descended into a flash mob-style chaos in central London

One man opted for minimal clothing as he addressed the swarm of participants with a megaphone and waved his pillow above his head

Several people ripped open their pillows and millions of feathers could be seen strewn all over the ground following the mass playful fight in Trafalgar Square

From tiger onesies to Scooby Doo costumes, people dressed up in all kinds of fancy dress outfits as they took part in the quirky event - which occurred in Trafalgar Square for the sixth year in a row today

International Pillow Fight Day is organised by Urban Playground Movement, which aims to put on a number of free, fun for all ages, non-commercial public events around the world

Some people, including this woman, clambered aboard their friends or partner's shoulders and armed themselves with two pillows to try and get one up on their opponent

The weather remained dry and partly sunny for the free event which resulted in the London skyline being momentarily filled with millions of feathers in Trafalgar Square

Many tourists and passers-by stopped to watch and take photographs and video of the huge pillow fight which lasted for around an hour

People from all over the world took part in International Pillow Fight Day, with organised events taking place in Paris, London, Zurich, Amsterdam, New York, Canada, Italy and Spain

People of all ages took pillows of all kinds - from large, fluffy ones to small, compact ones - to the gigantic pillow fight in London's Trafalgar Square

While many people stood on the sidelines to take photographs of the mass fight, the rules of the free event state participants shouldn't hit anyone with a camera or anyone who is without a pillow in their hand

The gigantic pillow fight filled Trafalgar Square with millions of feathers - which were briefly left strewn all over the road until the big clean-up got underway

Workers swept the feathers to one side and bundled the left-over pillows into the refuse truck after revellers left the ripped-up fluffy pillows in the centre of Trafalgar Square after the flash mob style event

Millions of feathers were swept up and binned in the rubbish truck by the City of Westminster Clean Streets team who organised a big clean-up in the aftermath of the event

Although many people took their pillows back home with them, several were dumped on the side of the street in Trafalgar Square and it was up to the City of Westminster workers to clear them from the popular tourist area

It wasn't just London which hosted a giant pillow fight - people in Zurich, Switzerland, pictured, also turned out in their droves to take part in the fun event

In Zurich, Switzerland, around 400 people gathered outside Zurich's Opera House to celebrate International Pillow Fight Day

Around 100 people turned out in the streets of Lausanne, Switzerland, armed with feather-filled pillows and bags of energy to celebrate the international day

Some people in Lausanne, Switzerland, got so enthusiastic about the event that their pillows ripped and feathers flew into the air. However, the rules state that participants must only bring 'soft' pillows and must not bring any pillow cases which may have buttons or zips which could cause injury to others

International Pillow Fight Day was celebrated with much less gusto in Stockholm, Sweden where the sun shone down on participants who managed to keep their pillows intact

A smaller number of people turned out in Stockholm, Sweden, than in London, and many grimaced as they were hit by fellow pillow-fighters

The event brought joy to dozens of people in Singapore where many ended up lying down on a bed of pillows on the floor and taking selfies of themselves with their torn fluffy pillows

After the mass pillow fight in Hong Kong's financial district, participants gathered to throw the loose feathers in the air and watch them float back down to the ground

Hong Kong, pictured, was just one of more than 100 cities around the world to take part in the event which is usually held on the first Saturday in April

Feathers were aplenty in Hong Kong's financial district after the mass pillow fight saw dozens of people rip their fluffy pillows apart and launch their feathers into the air

Some people in Hong Kong took to drawing on their pillows, with one woman painting a SpongeBob SquarePants picture on her pillow

Around 200 people formed a sea of pillows and loose feathers as they went at each other while wearing a colourful assortment of pyjamas in Hong Kong

From colourful pillows, to bright fluorescent onesies - Hong Kong participants pulled out all the stops to ensure they celebrated International Pillow Fight Day in style

Many people found time to pause from the action and take a 'selfie' of themselves celebrating the childhood tradition

The pillow fights are seen as a way to get people outside and relieve stress, according to organisers Urban Playground Movement. The group tries to put on a number of free and fun events in public spaces around the world every year
