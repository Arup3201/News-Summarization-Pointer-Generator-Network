Covered: Breast pumps and kits are now covered under insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act

The Affordable Care Act means many things for women, including birth control for all policy holders with no additional payment from the patient required.

A lesser-known facet of the new so-called Obamacare law is a provision that requires insurance companies to cover the full cost of breast pumps without a deductible or out-of-pocket expense for new mothers.

The cost of these devices is covered in insurance premiums, which in turn are paid by policyholders.

The Washington Post notes that it was pumps, not pills, that caught suppliers off-guard after January 1, when this part of the Affordable Care Act went into law.

The catch for all new mothers is that only certain breast pump models are covered, and they have to be ordered through a licensed provider. 

Yummy Mummy, a New York-based boutique that specializes in accessories a new mother would need, has been mulling how best to serve their clientele.

Owner Amanda Cole told the Post that she and her staff have been inundated with calls, and that she’s improvising how best to handle the new business.

The business owner recently signed a contract with health giant Aetna to become a licenced provider of breast pumps.

So far, around five kits are covered by insurance, as well as bottles, breast shields, and caps.

‘Now that the plan really took effect on January 1st, there’s been a marked change,’ she told the paper. 

Without insurance, new mothers could pay upwards of $300 for a pump, milk containers, sterilizers, and other paraphernalia.

Control: As part of the ACA in effect, insurance companies must provide any FDA-approved contraception

The $2.8 trillion U.S. healthcare system costs nearly $9,000 a year for every man, woman and child, according to Reuters. 

As the New York Times noted today, some policyholder’s insurance premiums went up by double-digit percentages in 2013 due in part to the ACA.

The Times reported that Anthem Blue Cross in California has proposed raising its rates by 26 percent, and other private insurers are onboard.
