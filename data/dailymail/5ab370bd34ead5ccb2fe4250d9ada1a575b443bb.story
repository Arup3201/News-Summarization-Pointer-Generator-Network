Luxury brands are reporting booming sales of erotic products from a new group of women known as 'Sindies'.

Sindies are Single Income Now Divorced - high-earning females, often with children, back on the dating scene and looking for fun.

Actress Liz Hurley, TV presenter Melanie Sykes and supermodel Heidi Klum are all members.

Typically they are enjoying their 'naughty forties' and may be dating several men casually as they seek a new Mr Right.

And they don't want to cut any corners in their pursuit of pleasure.

Lingerie firms have reported a 45 per cent surge in sales among this group - newly single women aged between 35 and 50.

They are specifically buying the most provocative lingerie, which previously had been more popular with twenty-somethings.

Sales of sexy basques are up 28 per cent among Sindies and stockings and suspenders are up 32 per cent.

And the most popular lingerie line amongst this group is the bondage-themed designs - with sales up 17 per cent.

Bluebella, who commissioned the survey, said erotic lingerie like theirs is in demand from 'Sindies'

Researchers believe that Melanie Sykes typifies the new Sindies

The study also found that, in Britain, where 65 per cent of divorces are initiated by women, Sindies
 are celebrating their new-found freedom by throwing 'divorce parties' 
with other recent singles - typically spending around Â£90-a-head on the 
brand's renowned 'erotic chic'.

There are many current celebrity Sindies who typify this trend, according to the research.

Liz
 Hurley, 48, appears to be enjoying herself after splitting with her 
cricketer boyfriend Shane Warne having previously divorced her husband.

Melanie Sykes, 43, split with husband of eight years and father of her two sons and became a cougar icon after training
 her body into pristine shape for her Ultimo campaigns - she recently 
split with her toyboy husband and is back on the market.

Then
 there's supermodel Heidi Klum, 40, estimated to be worth Â£45 million, 
and now back on the dating scene after splitting with her husband of 
seven years, singer Seal.

A spokesperson for Bluebella, who commissioned the survey, said the market for erotic lingerie is changing fast.

She said: 'We have been delighted to watch the emergence of the Sindies for some time.

'These are women who know what they want and they are embracing their sensual lives with confidence and style.

'Melanie Sykes typifies the new Sindies. She has worked incredibly hard at the gym and with a body to die for she is embracing her sensuality far more ferociously than when she was one of our most successful models in the Nineties.

'And why not? Women of all ages read Fifty Shades Of Grey and the book's influence has contributed to women feeling far more empowered and experimental than ever before.

'The book has proved more than a light entertainment - it has prompted real life-style change and the result is an exciting new generation of Sindies who are determined to enjoy themselves.'
