Liverpool look set to complete the signing of Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno in a £12million deal.

Brendan Rodgers hopes that Moreno can solve Liverpool's problem left-back position - so is he the man to finally fill this role permanently? 

Here, Sportsmail tells you more...

Crying: Moreno was in a tearful state as he waved goodbye to Sevilla fans ahead of his Liverpool move

Is he worth it?

£12m pounds for a player Sevilla had originally slapped a 30m euros buy-out clause on is very good value and at just 22 Liverpool are buying huge potential.

If there was one thing they lacked last season it was an inability to get in behind stubborn defences (remember that decisive defeat to Chelsea during the title run-in) Moreno will open teams up arriving from deeper.

But he will be tested defensively and judging from Tuesday night's tears he'll miss home.

And he's a full-back, but with a winger's soul?

He is a full-back in the Brazilian sense of the word (that’s pre-World Cup 2014 ‘Brazilian’).

He flies forward Dani Alves style and has been used as a wing back and even as a left-winger by Sevilla coach Unai Emery.

His influence on the team was nowhere near as great but there are similarities with former Sevilla right-back Alves and now with Barcelona’s other attacking full-back Jordi Alba.

Is he highly-rated in Spain and if so why have the big two their not snapped him up?

Madrid did take a look but their style is not usually to spend big on homegrown defenders when they can buy attacking players from abroad at three times the price.

And Barcelona have Alba - who Moreno will be competing with for a place in the Spain starting XI if he progresses at Liverpool.

Vicente Del Bosque capped him last season and rates him highly and Unai Emery gave him his debut aged 19. If Emery and Del Bosque rate him it’s safe to say Liverpool have a player.

Will he handle the switch?

Two years ago he was a Sevilla reserve player. In just two campaigns he has become a first team regular, been capped by Spain, and now earned a move to the Premier League.

A lot has happened to him in a short space of time and there will be some adjusting needed.

But he will not be alone on the North-West. His former Spain Under-21 team-mate David De Gea will be just a short drive away. In Alvaro Negredo he will have a former Sevilla team-mate close-by too. Philippe Couthinho also speaks Spanish as does his new coach Brendan Rodgers.

So success or failure?

He is going to the right club. Rodgers won’t baulk at his forward forays, he’ll encourage them.

This is a player who had never played as a defender until three years ago when he converted from winger to full-back.

But he has learned well under Sevilla’s experienced full-back Fernando Navarro. That education will continue at Liverpool and so will the license to overlap.

And he has the temperament to handle the pressure?

He will enjoy Anfield.

He’s a football fan who grew up watching the thrilling Sevilla side that won back to back Uefa Cups and two Spanish Cups six or seven years ago under Juande Ramos. He stood on the stands of the Sanchez Pizjuan and cheered on Alves and company as a teenage fan.

He’ll respond in the right way to the big European nights Liverpool are hoping to have his season.
