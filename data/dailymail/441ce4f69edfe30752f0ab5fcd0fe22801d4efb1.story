She started the Cambridge Satchel Company from her kitchen table in Cambridge with just £600 in 2008, when her children asked for leather bags similar to those worn by Harry Potter characters.

Starting small, she found a leather supplier in Hull and asked him to make her eight chestnut brown satchels.

Now, five years later, mother-of-one Julie Deane, 46, joins forces with one of the biggest names in fashion for an eclectic AW13 collection.

Dame Vivienne Westwood has teamed up with the English accessories brand, now worth a cool £12million, to design and produce an exclusive range of limited-edition collector's bags.

Inspiration for this classic satchel comes from Vivienne's pirate boots first seen in her AW81 collection

'I could not feel more excited to 
announce the collaboration of Vivienne Westwood and The Cambridge 
Satchel Company,' says 
founder Julie Deane.

'Vivienne Westwood is an iconic British designer with a 
strong ethical base and I am incredibly proud of the association.'

Exploring
new territories, the collection showcases the best of both brands 
combining the famous iconic satchel design and Vivienne Westwood's 
squiggle print.

Inspiration
for this classic satchel is taken from the British designer's infamous 
pirate boots first seen in her Autumn Winter 1981 Pirate collection.

The pale tan straps and buckles introduced on the satchel replicate the ones used on Vivienne Westwood's pirate boots.

For the legendary Pirate collection, Westwood and McLaren weaved a fantasy with swashbuckling clothes and highwaymen, dandies, buccaneers and pirates.

It was during this time that Westwood 
began her technical research into historical dress, and since then has 
often found inspiration in the past. It was also for this collection that the squiggle print was first used.

The exciting collaboration speaks of both the brands' heritages, but modernises it for a fresh look.

Working with Vivienne Westwood seems like a natural progression for The Cambridge Satchel Company, further securing its role and international acclaim as the iconic 'Brit It bag'.

The Cambridge Satchel Company has fast become a pioneering business prized for their commitment to preserving British manufacturing whilst producing cutting edge designs.

'We are very pleased to be working with The Cambridge Satchel Company for this collaboration. Their satchels are nostalgic and fun and make the perfect canvas for our squiggle print,' say Westwood's design team.

The bags are produced in soft, printed leather and are available in three colours: yellow with black squiggle, white with red squiggle and brown with black squiggle.

They are also available in two sizes: 14in for £195 and 11in for £165 and available exclusively at Vivienne Westwood standalone boutiques and The Cambridge Satchel Company stores from October.

From humble beginnings, the Cambridge Satchel Company has expanded its collection to include small leather goods in addition to the brand’s iconic leather satchels.

While the traditional Vintage and Red Satchels remain classic pieces, the company has kept the design fresh by adding many modern twists to the original, such as the fluorescent colours and contemporary leather finishes.

Collaborations have seen the Cambridge Satchel Company grace the catwalk for Comme des Garcon, Basso and Brooke, Christopher Shannon and Chris Benz.

The company has also established a wealth of celebrity fans including The Saturdays, Alexa Chung, Zooey Deschanel, Emma Stone and Lena Dunham.
