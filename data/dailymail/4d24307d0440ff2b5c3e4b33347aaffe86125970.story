The A-listers on the Oscars red carpet were the epitome of glamour and sophistication, with most of the stars looking elegant in their floor-length gowns.

However, the after-parties were a different affair altogether, with celebrities - some of whom who were not invited to the awards ceremony itself - trying their best to grab the limelight in revealing dresses and no underwear.

Rita Ora flashed her bottom in her see-through black gown at the Vanity Fair Oscar bash, while model Irina Shayk gave the singer a run for her money as the most daringly dressed in a gown that exposed half her body with only a few black panels to protect her modesty.

Barely there: Singer Rita Ora wows in a see-through black floor-length gown that left little to the imagination at the Vanity Fair Oscars party

Little to the imagination... Rita's outrageous floor-length gown, which she accessorized with a pair of black diamond earrings by Lorraine Schwartz, showed off her curves - as well as her tattoo

At the Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards Viewing Party, mother-of-four Heidi Klum, 41, also went for a daring outfit. 

She wore a sparkling Versace gown that exposed her ribs and side boob as well as her hips and legs, forcing her to forgo wearing any underwear for the evening. 

Model Gigi Hadid also opted for a slinky cut-away style floor-length gown, complete with thigh-high split as she attended the Vanity Fair party.

Bras were definitely not an outfit staple for the evening as many of the stars ditched theirs to show off their bare backs or reveal a plunging cleavage. 

Some of the actresses who had attended the ceremony - such as Naomi Watts and Emma Stone - changed into different outfits for the after parties which were more revealing. 

Birdman actress Naomi Watts ditched her Armani gown for a white suit that flashed her cleavage while best supporting actress nominee Emma swapped her custom-made Elie Saab gown for a less flattering maroon dress that also revealed her decolletage.

Beyonce looked breathtaking at Sunday's night's post Oscar Vanity Fair party as she shunngled up next to Jennifer Lopez - and it was her simple white dress accessoried with stunning diamonds (the size of that necklace!) that caught everyone's attention.

It's by Stella McCartney and we love the padded shoulders and dramatic puddle train. Whilst a white maxi dress might seem a bit too bridal, the key is to keep it simple like this one. Add a chunky choker and numerous cocktail rings a la Beyonce and you won't be in danger of anyone thinking you're about to walk down the aisle!

Jennifer Lopez wore a cleavage-exposing dress to the Oscar ceremony and then changed into this revealing gown at the Vanity Fair party. The sheer nude dress meant she wore neither bra or knickers for the evening

Speaking of the trend for revealing outfits at the after-parties stylist Jules Standish told FEMAIL: 'Once the formal ceremony is over it's OK for the celebrities to let their hair down and get into their revealing after-show-stopping outfits.

'Rita Ora, Irina Shayk and Gigi Hadid all seemed in competition to see who could wear as little of their black dresses as possible. Irina shows us all why she is a top lingerie model with an intricate outfit of black tights with what seems to be a dress attached. No underwear modelling needed here.

'Rita Ora shows off her stunningly fit derriere in her sheer dress, and Gigi wears a cut-out dress with swirls which leaves no place (or need in her case) for Spanx or any other body hugging under garments.

'These girls are daring, brave and want the world to know they are outgoing, risk taking ladies – there's nowhere better to get a guaranteed picture in the press than the Oscars after-party and with a green ticket to be as outrageous as they like.'
