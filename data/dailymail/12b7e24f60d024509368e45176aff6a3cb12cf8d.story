A Texas man's capital murder trial opened Tuesday almost 17 years after he allegedly set an eight-year-old boy on fire.  

Twenty-nine-year-old Don Collins was 13 when prosecutors say he tied then eight-year-old Robert Middleton to a tree, doused him with gasoline, and set him on fire in 1998, according to the  Chronicle.

The attack was an effort to silence Middleton after Collins reportedly sexually assaulted him two weeks earlier, the Chronicle reports.

Not Guilty: Collins pleaded not guilty to the crime

Middleton was burned across 99 percent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer. 

His death was ruled a homicide because the burns were almost exclusively to blame for the cancer.

Collins, a convicted sex offender, turned his head from the screen Tuesday as prosecutors showed images of young Middleton's badly burned body. 

And the Chronicle reports that he has pleaded not guilty.

A judge determined in March that Collins could be tried for murder as an adult, despite being a teenager at the time.

Last year, after learning the case would go to trial, Colleen Middleton, Robert's mother, said the journey for her son's justice has been a 'long road,' the Chronicle reports.

'When Robert died, we were thinking maybe nothing will ever happen,' Colleen said. 

Maybe someone is just going to get away with what they did to him.' 

Defense attorneys said in a Galveston County courtroom Tuesday that there were no witnesses to the attack and prosecutors are playing to the jury's emotions.

'Do not expect the defense to bring an eyewitness to this tragedy because there is not one,' the Houston Chronicle reported attorney E. Tay Bond as telling jurors. 

'There are no witnesses from the woods except for Robbie.'

But prosecutors countered that witnesses will testify that Collins admitted to them that he poured gasoline on Middleton as the boy walked through woods near his home, according to the Chronicle.

'Our case is based on the testimony of adults who have come forward and can tell you what this man did when they were children,' Montgomery County prosecutor Kelly Blackburn said in his opening statement.

Middleton named Collins as his attacker and the older boy was arrested in 1998. 

Collins spent several months in juvenile detention but was released after prosecutors said they didn't have enough evidence to pursue the case.

Disposition: Shortly before he died, Middleton gave a videotaped deposition in which he accused Collins for the first time of sexually assaulting him two weeks before the attack

Shortly before he died, Middleton gave a videotaped deposition in which he accused Collins for the first time of sexually assaulting him two weeks before the attack.

The sexual assault allegation prompted investigators to reopen the case. 

Prosecutors charged Collins with murder in 2013, but they needed to move the case from juvenile to adult court to take him to trial.

After a three-day hearing last March, state District Judge Kathleen Hamilton ruled that Collins could be tried for murder by an adult court.

A man who was sexually assaulted by Collins in 2001, when he was eight years old, testified in a hearing to determine whether Collins should be tried as an adult for the crime against Middleton.

The victim said that Collins threatened to burn him if he told anyone about the assault.
