Flawed: Jeremy Hunt told the Commons said that he was unhappy with the analysis which lead to the planned axing of units in Leeds, Leicester and London

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday suspended controversial plans to close three children’s heart surgery units.

Mr Hunt acted after an independent report said the closures were based on flawed analysis.

The guidance from the Independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP) comes after a bitter fightback by threatened units at Leeds General Infirmary, Glenfield Hospital in Leicester and the Royal Brompton in west London.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Commons he was unhappy at the way a £6million review proposed axing units in Leeds, Leicester and London.

He said a new independent panel had found 'too many questions unanswered' and the closure programme was being suspended.

The Safe and Sustainable Review has proposed  
closing units at Leeds General Infirmary (LGI), Glenfield Hospital in 
Leicester and the Royal Brompton in west London.

But the decision was heavily criticised and campaigners 
have fought ferociously against the plans.

A new report by the Independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP) found serious problems with the way the running of the review, Mr Hunt told MPs.

He has now asked NHS England to continue with the process of looking into the reorganisation of children's heart surgery and asked them to report back by the end of July.

He said that while the IRP agrees with the need for change in the services the NHS provides, it found the Safe and Sustainable Review 'was based on a flawed analysis of the impact of incomplete proposals and leaves too may questions about sustainability and implementation'.

Mr Hunt added: ‘This is clearly a serious criticism of the safe and sustainable process.

‘I therefore accept their recommendation that the proposals cannot go ahead in their current form and am suspending the review today.’

The decision was welcomed by campaigners, who had warned children in need of heart surgery and their families. would have to travel too far to reach their nearest unit if the closures went ahead.

Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘I think we have to be frank with people that we can't expect really technical surgery - like children's heart operations, to be carried out at every hospital in the country.

‘As the parent of a desperately ill child, wanting to get the best care for that child, you need to know that you're getting something that is world best.

‘For really technical operations you can't get that everywhere. Clearly the conclusion is that this process, which started in 2008, hasn't been carried out properly so we need to make a re-start.’

Uncertainty: Children's heart surgery at Royal Brompton Hospital in west London had been to to end but the closure has now been suspended

The original decision to close the 
three units was part of a general review of children's heart services 
across England based on the premise that there was a need to concentrate
expertise in more specialist centres.

The
Safe and Sustainable review followed the landmark inquiry into 
children’s heart surgery at Bristol Royal Infirmary between 1990 and 
1995, where up to 35 children and babies died as a result of poor care.

In
the wake of the inquiry, it was recommended that paediatric cardiac 
units be set a target for the number of operations per year, and surgery
be concentrated in a few specialist centres in order to ensure quality 
of care.

The proposals had suggested the 
institutions which were to house the specialist surgery centres were: 
Evelina Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust, 
Great Ormond Street, both in London, Southampton General Hospital, 
Birmingham Children's Hospital, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, the
Freeman Hospital in Newcastle and Alder Hey Children's Hospital in 
Liverpool.

John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford was originally part of the 
consultation process but it suspended its children's heart programme in 2010 following a spate of deaths.

Safety: Units at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester and Leeds General Infirmary were also earmarked for closure by a £6million review, which has now been identified as 'flawed'

Senior medical figures today insisted that major changes still needed to go ahead.

Dr Jacqueline Cornish, NHS England 
clinical director for children and young people, said there was a 
‘compelling case for change’.

‘We will have a plan by the end of 
July, then we would hope to move to implementation of whatever this plan
is going to show us by 12 months' time,’ she told BBC Radio 4's The 
World At One.

‘This is ambitious but I think it shows the gravity 
with which we take this and our complete ambition to do this in the 
interests of getting improved children's outcomes, making it safer and 
making the entire surgical service sustainable.

‘We understand this 
is a highly emotionally-charged issue but what we are attempting to do 
is outline a national service for children.’

Lord Ribeiro, chairman of the IRP, said: ‘We have listened to a wide cross-section of individuals and organisations during recent months, giving us the opportunity to meet and hear from many parents, children, frontline staff, local charities and volunteers involved in these services.

‘The focus of this review and the panel's advice is fundamentally about the long-term future and best interests of children with congenital heart disease.

‘The critical factor to consider, in the panel's view, is that engagement of all interested parties is the key to achieving improvements for patients and families without unnecessary delay.

‘There is now a real opportunity to involve patients, public and other stakeholders in taking work forward as set out in the Panel's recommendations.’
