A killer who stabbed his girlfriend's stepfather in front of his victim's family has been jailed for 11 years.

Nicolas Warrender thrust a steak knife into 'unarmed and unsuspecting' Kevin Gaunt’s heart during the confrontation in June, after he mistakenly believed the 52-year-old had assaulted Hannah Gaunt, Newcastle Crown Court heard.

Mr Gaunt, a grandfather, staggered into his kitchen and collapsed in a pool of blood on the floor as his distraught wife Carole begged 'don't leave me, please don’t leave me'.

As her husband lay dying Mrs Gaunt was frantically trying to keep her four-year-old granddaughter, who she had been babysitting, away from the horror happening inside the house while calling for help.

Warrender, 23, of Houghton-le-Spring, Tyne and Wear, denied murder and was tried by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court.

He claimed a knife he had been using to cut an apple had accidentally caused the fatal wound on Father's Day as he fended off an attack by Mr Gaunt.

But prosecutor Robert Woodcock QC told the court how Warrender had 'armed himself' with the blade after he had been out drinking with his victim's stepdaughter Hannah, 20.

On the night of the killing, the 
couple had been out drinking while Mr Gaunt and his wife looked after 
Hannah’s little girl at their home next door.

After the night out a row erupted and Hannah was ordered out of her mother and step father’s home.

She went back to her own house and Mr 
and Mrs Gaunt locked their door for the night but moments later 
Warrender turned up to confront his girlfriend’s step father.

Mr Woodcock said: 'There clearly was some kind of scuffle between them.

'The result of it was that Kevin Gaunt was fatally wounded with one stab wound to the chest.

'The wound, say the prosecution, was 
caused by the defendant Nicolas Warrender, in his misguided belief that 
Hannah had been assaulted by Kevin Gaunt.

Newcastle Crown Court heard how the 23-year-old had confronted the unarmed, popular grandfather

'Before he went around to have it out 
with Kevin Gaunt he had armed himself with a knife, a steak knife from a
block in Hannah’s kitchen, a weapon, say the prosecution, which he had 
concealed, of which, say the prosecution, Kevin Gaunt almost certainly 
never had sight of at all.'

After more than five hours deliberation jurors rejected Warrender’s claim that what happened had been a complete accident while protecting himself and found him guilty of manslaughter yesterday.

He was found not guilty of the charge of murder.

Judge James Goss QC told him: 'You armed yourself with a sharp steak knife with a blade of over four inches and in the ensuing confrontation you stabbed Kevin Gaunt through the heart.

'I am quite satisfied you took the knife with you at least prepared to use it as a weapon if the need arose.

'You were significantly under the influence of alcohol, two-and-a-half to three times the limit for driving a vehicle.

'The offence was committed virtually on the victim’s doorstep to his home, in the presence of his wife and his wife’s granddaughter, a child who was clearly deeply upset by what took place.

'You have never acknowledged your crime and there can be no credit for guilty plea or remorse.'

Toby Hedworth QC, defending while Warrender does have previous convictions for violence he has been out of trouble for over four years and has no history of carrying weapons.

The grieving family of Kevin Gaunt has been left devastated by the death of the devoted dad and grandad.

He left behind four children of his own as well as grandchildren.

Speaking on behalf of the family, cousin Jason Gaunt, 38, said: 'Warrender has destroyed this family. We will never get over this.

'Kevin was a big strong man who loved his family.

'The conviction gives us some relief, although whatever happened in court can never bring him back or come anywhere close to stopping our pain.

'At least the conviction means there is one less person on the streets using a knife to sort out a row.'

Mr Gaunt’s family said the hundreds of people who turned out to pay their respects at his funeral showed how popular and well thought of he was by so many.

Mr Gaunt’s cousin Kay Thompson, 44, said: 'He would do anything for anybody, if you wanted anything done you just asked Kevin.

'As soon as you said you needed something it was done, it was never too much trouble for him, nothing was.

'He was always up for a laugh and was so popular and well known in the area.'
