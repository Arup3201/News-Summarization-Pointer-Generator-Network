Marine experts today warned people not to enter the water after
two killer whales were spotted 100 yards off the English coast. 

The 'enormous super
predators' were described as unpredictable and could attack surfers and bathers
mistaking them for prey. 

A mother and calf were spotted off the coast of
Padstow, Cornwall - just 15 miles from the surfing mecca of Newquay - and experts
warned the giant whale may inadvertently harm a human or attack while protecting its
young.

Peter Richardson, of the Marine Conservation Society, said: 'Obviously we wouldn't recommend getting into the water with a killer
whale.

'They
are enormous super predators and are therefore unpredictable.

'There
is a pod of killer whales in Scotland and they could be travelling around the
country. 

'Not a lot is known about the movements of killer whales
but the probability is they are here for food.

'There
are plenty of seals along the south coast especially around Padstow and
Newquay.'

Several people have reportedly seen the
whales, a rare sight in the area, over the last ten days.

Ocean scientist Dom Clarke, 25, saw what he believes was a mother and calf near Trevose Head, five miles from Padstow (pictured) while walking along the cliff

Ocean scientist Dom Clarke, 25, saw what
he believes was the mother and calf near Trevose Head, five miles from Padstow
while walking along the cliff.

He said he saw them heading south towards
Newquay.

Mr Clarke told how he came across a man with binoculars
who asked him what species of whale he thought they were.

'I thought "wow, that is pretty unusual to
see", so I grabbed the binoculars,' he said.

'At the time they were heading south along
the coast about 100 metres off the headland. It was pretty special.'

He added that a bird watcher had said he
spotted the whales near Trevose the following day.

Fisherman Zyg Gregorek, who has travelled the world hunting
fearsome sea predators, said: 'All sea predators present a danger.

Killer whales (Orcinus orca), also known
as orcas, can grow up to 32ft in length and weigh up to 9 tonnes.

The
distinctive triangular dorsal fin can grow up to 6ft high.

They are mainly found around Iceland,
Norway and northern Scotland, but occasionally some are seen as far south as
the Atlantic coasts of Spain and Portugal and east into the Mediterranean.

'If a
swimmer or a surfer got too close to a killer whale, it only takes one swish of
the tail and you've had it. 

'A killer whale might be curious around
humans and therefore might attack, whether by accident or design. Also, because of over-fishing, their diets have been affected.

'If they are starving, they can be unpredictable and there is a possibility
they may go for a human.

Tom Hardy, of the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: 'I remember
there were reports of a killer whale attacking a basking shark in Cornwall
years ago. 

'But attacks on humans are extremely rare. You would be
very unlucky to get attacked by one.'

According to the SeaWatch Foundation, killer
whale sightings are rare in the waters off the coast of South West England,
with most sightings between March and September.

The whales were seen just 15 miles from the surfing mecca of Newquay

In September last year, a holidaymaker at
the Bedruthan Steps Hotel at Mawgan Porth, around eight miles south of Trevose,
spotted a pod of four killer whales while eating breakfast in the cliff-top
hotel.

Mr Clarke, who runs a rockpool exploration
and education company, Explore the Shore, suggested that the whales could have
been feeding locally.

'At the moment there must be a lot of fish
inshore. And that day there was also a really huge shoal of porpoises about a
kilometre off the headland,' he said.

Angie Gall, marine conservation officer
with the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said the whales may have merely
passed through the area en route to more northerly waters around Scotland.

'There is only evidence of one "kill" made
by killer whales in Cornish waters and that was a basking shark," she said.

Basking sharks are known to congregate in
huge numbers off the Cornish coast in the summer and are a familiar sight for
tourists in the area.
