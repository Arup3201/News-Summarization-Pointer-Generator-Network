The awesome power of nature was on full display as stormchasers captured these amazing images of a mothership supercell storm forming over Nebraska.

The giant thunderstorm terrified residents as it made it way across the High Plains in Nebraska, looking like a scene from a Hollywood disaster movie.

But the awesome phenomenon has a very real danger, as they are responsible for nearly all of the significant tornadoes in the U.S.

These incredible shots were taken just a day after a team of tornado photographers captured stunning footage of a spinning supercell in the sky of east Wyoming.

Supercells often occur when winds are turning clockwise with height, producing a storm-scale rotation.

They are known to produce extreme winds, with speeds over 100mph, and flash foods.

Windswept dust and rain dominate the storm's centre while rings of jagged clouds surround the edge.
