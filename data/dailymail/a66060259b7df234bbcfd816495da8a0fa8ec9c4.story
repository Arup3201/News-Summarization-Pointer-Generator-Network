The director of a refuse firm has been jailed after repeatedly failing to clear a 42ft mountain of rubbish.

Robert McNaughton had been given multiple court orders to clear the festering 'eyesore', which loomed over a housing estate in Brierley Hill, West Midlands.

But, after refusing to comply, he has been jailed for six months, having previously been given a suspended setence.

Robert Mcnaughton was jailed on Monday after failing to comply with multiple court orders

McNaughton had been subject to six legal hearings, dating back to May 3, 2012, to get the mess cleared up.

And he was given the sentence in June but it was suspended by a judge who gave him a ‘last chance’ to comply with the court.

He failed to do so and the prison term was activated on Monday after he did not clear the mess by September 10.

At Birmingham High Court Mr Justice MacDuff said there had been repeated and flagrant breaches of court orders by McNaughton.

The businessman failed to comply with multiple court orders to tidy the mess and has now been jailed for six months

He also imposed another order insisting the site - previously occupied by McNaughton’s firm Refuse Derived Fuel Ltd - be cleared by February 17, 2014.

If it is not McNaughton was told he could face further criminal charges.

David Hudson, environment manager at the Environment Agency said: ‘In handing Mr McNaughton a custodial sentence, the court has recognised the seriousness of not complying with environmental legislation and court orders.

‘We know residents are frustrated and we appreciate their ongoing support.

‘Our priority has always been to get the site cleared, and we think those responsible should still be made to pay.

‘We will continue to work to make this happen.’
