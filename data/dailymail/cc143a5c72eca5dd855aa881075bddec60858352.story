Despite countless Whitehall campaigns and initiatives, Britons still don’t really care about the environment, a survey has found.

Nearly two thirds  admit to being indifferent, and one in ten young people claim not to care about recycling at all.

A third of people thought they recycled as much as possible – but only one in six said they consciously bought items because they were made from recycled materials.

According to research, the average UK home recycles only 250 of the 440 plastic bottles it uses every year

The survey of 1,000 people was carried out by Pledge4Plastics, the latest Government-backed initiative to tackle unnecessary use of landfill. 

It will undoubtedly worry bureaucrats tasked with getting Britain to hit EU targets of recycling half our waste by 2020.

In September last year, England’s household recycling rate stood at 43.9 per cent – a decline from 44.1 per cent in 2012.

And according to Pledge4Plastics, the average UK home uses 440 plastic bottles a year, but recycles just 250 of them. 

One in five people admit they don’t recycle fizzy drink or milk bottles, while a quarter don’t put juice or water bottles in the correct bin.

Some 5billion plastic bottles were sent to UK landfill sites last year.

The most recent figures from the EU statistics office reveal that Germany is the continent’s recycling leader at 65 per cent.

Britain is on 43.9 per cent, while France recycles 39 per cent. 

Romania recycles just 1 per cent of household waste.
