A young mother died from cervical cancer after doctors were accused of missing the signs of her disease nine times and refusing her a smear test, saying that at 20 she was too young.

Keely Devine had complained of pain in her hip and abdomen, as well as heavy bleeding, following the birth of her son Jayden.

She visited her GP to discuss her symptoms more than six times and attended hospital three times in two-and-a-half years, but was repeatedly told that she had an infection and given antibiotics.

Tragic: Keely Devine, 23, (pictured in hospital) died from cervical cancer after doctors were accused of missing the signs of her disease nine times and refusing her a smear test, saying that at 20 she was too young

Miss Devine was also fitted with a 
contraceptive coil to try and alleviate the heavy bleeding and discharge
 she was experiencing. But despite her repeatedly raising concerns about
 the pain she was experiencing, her family say she had no physical 
examinations and was refused a smear test on the grounds that she was 
too young to have this.

By the time she was diagnosed with cervical cancer it was too late.

She had a large tumour measuring 5cm x 6cm x 3cm which was obstructing her cervix and the cancer had spread into her pelvis.

Just
 three years after she first reported her symptoms after the birth of 
her son in September 2010, she was dead at the age of 23, having spent 
the last four months of her life on the Teenage Cancer Ward at St James's Hospital in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

Miss
 Devine, of of Armley, Leeds, was diagnosed with cervical cancer on 
January 4, 2013 and began a six week course of radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy a few weeks later on February  19.

Battle: Miss Devine visited her GP to discuss her symptoms more than six times and attended hospital three times in two-and-a-half years, but was repeatedly told that she had an infection and given antibiotics

The gruelling treatment caused her to suffer side effects such as severe sickness, vomiting and weight loss.

By May 2013, the cancer had begun to affect her bowel and bladder and she was admitted to Hospital because of extreme constipation.

On June 13, Miss Devine's family were told that there was nothing more doctors could do to treat her cancer, and that her condition was terminal. She remained in hospital until she died on 7 September 2013.

Now her mother Alexandra Dickinson has instructed specialist medical lawyers to investigate if more could have been done by her GP and Accident and Emergency doctors to diagnose Miss Devine earlier and potentially treat her cervical cancer.

'As a family we are still coming to terms with losing Keely and in such tragic circumstances,' said Ms Dickinson, who is now looking after three-year-old Jayden.

All women aged between 25 and 64 are invited for cervical screening, with women aged between 25 and 49 encouraged to be tested every three years.

The starting age was raised from 20 in 2003, because it was found that cervical screening in younger women can do more harm than good.

Cervical cancer is linked to infection caused by the human 
papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause abnormalities in the cells of the 
cervix. In the majority of cases the immune system clears the infection,
 but in a small number of women the abnormalities persist, and may turn 
into something more serious - and if they are not treated can develop 
into a cancer.

Cervical abnormalities associated with HPV infection are very common in 
women under 25, but are rarer in older women, while in the majority of 
cases abnormalities in young women go away by themselves.

If younger women were screened, many would test positive for abnormalities, and would be sent for unnecessary treatment to remove the affected cells. 

This treatment may increase the likelihood of a women having a premature baby if she later becomes pregnant, and the treatment process can also cause the affected woman significant anxiety.

Cervical cancer is extremely rare in women under the age of 25 with just 2.6 cases per 100,000 women.

The Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) reviewed evidence over the risks and benefits of screening younger women in 2009, but decided to keep the age limit of 25.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer also recommends that women should not commence cervical screening before the age of 25.

'She
 had her whole life ahead of her and was looking forward to watching 
Jayden grow up. Instead her life was cut short and now I hope we can 
find answers as to why this could happen to my daughter and find out 
why, after she repeatedly complained to doctors about the pain and 
discomfort she was experiencing, that she was not diagnosed sooner.

'It was heartbreaking to see her struggling with her illness as it took hold in the last few months of her life. She was incredibly frightened and in a great amount of pain.

'She began to struggle to communicate with us and was finding it increasingly difficult to cope with her deterioration. She became wheelchair bound and extremely weak. She wanted to spend time with Jayden, but she didn't want him to see and remember her in so much pain and distress.

'Before she died, Keely was studying for a qualification in health and social care as she wanted to become a social worker. She was determined to gain this qualification so that she could give Jayden the best life possible.'

Ms Dickinson said that by suing the NHS for negligence, she hoped to find out if more could have been done to diagnose Miss Devine's cervical cancer earlier.

'No other young girls or mothers should have to go through what she did,' she said.

NHS smear tests are currently offered to women aged between 25 and 64, with NHS guidelines stating that the 'condition is very rare in women under 25.'

The NHS website adds: 'All women aged between 25 and 64 are invited for cervical screening. 
Women aged between 25 and 49 are invited for testing every three years, 
and women aged between 50 and 64 are invited every five years.

'Being screened regularly means that any abnormal changes in the cells
 of the cervix can be identified at an early stage and, if necessary, 
treated to stop cancer developing.

'It is estimated that early detection and treatment can prevent up to 75per cent of cervical cancers.'

'This is a heartbreaking situation as Keely was only 23-years-old when she died and also leaves behind a young son,' said Rachelle Mahapatra, of Irwin Mitchell's solicitors - which is representing Ms Dickinson.

'In
 the couple of years before her death Keely had made multiple visits to 
her GP and the hospital and we are investigating if more could have been
 done to spot the cervical cancer earlier.

'Although
 cervical cancer in young women is rare our specialist medical law team 
has dealt with a number of cases involving women in their twenties from 
across the country whose cervical cancer was initially missed by 
doctors.

'Delays in promptly
 diagnosing and treating cervical cancer can have devastating 
consequences and it is vital that doctors focus on the symptoms rather 
than the age of a woman when deciding whether or not it might be cancer.

'In
 this case we are still in the early stages of our investigation as her 
devastated family just want answers as to what happened during her care.

'They
 know nothing can turn back the clock but, this case is about 
highlighting any potential issues and lessons that can be learnt to 
hopefully prevent other young women from suffering as Keely did.'

A spokesman from the NHS said she was unable to comment on any individual cases.
