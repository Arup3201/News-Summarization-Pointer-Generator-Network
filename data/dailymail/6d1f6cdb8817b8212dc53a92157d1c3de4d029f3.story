Three-year-old Tommy Morrissey is driving a wedge between golfers at his local club - because he can hit the ball further than half of them, despite only having one arm.

The pint-sized prodigy, from Florida, has a swing so strong that he can single-handedly smash a golf ball more than 100 yards.

He is so dedicated to his sport, in fact, that he even takes his clubs to bed with him at night. 

'Most kids have stuffed animals in their cribs,' his mother, Marcia told Golf.com. 'Tommy slept with his golf clubs. And it wasn't just one club. He had eight in there. One night we forgot one and he freaked out and said, 'I need my driver.''

Strong arm: While most people might consider such a disability as hindrance, Tommy sees it as more of a strength

Loving family: Tommy was born with an underdeveloped right arm after it became trapped under mother Marcia's rib cage as a foetus (pictured together

While most people might consider such a disability as hindrance, Tommy sees it as more of a strength.

Adorably, he has even nicknamed his stump 'Nemo,' after the character in the Disney animated film who has an underdeveloped fin. 

Now the youngster has become an online sensation, after videos of him playing on an 18-hole course went viral. 

Tommy lives with his family in Florida but spends his summer holidays in Linwood, New Jersey, where he likes to practice on its professional course. 

'I was very skeptical at first,' Linwood PGA professional Jeff LeFevre, who gave him a lesson, told ABC News. 'Most 3-year-olds are more interested in Tonka Trucks than golf … But Tommy was different. His setup and stance were perfect, and he had the slight hesitation at the top of his backswing that you're looking for. I stepped back and had a tear in my eye. The ball is the biggest truth in golf, and he hit it square. He is beyond unique.'

'Amazing': Joe says golfers who see Tommy swing are impressed enough that a three-year-old can drive so well ... and are even more impressed when they realise he has only one arm

Early start: His parents, both avid golfers themselves, told Golf Digest that Tommy's fascination with the sport started very early on

Tommy was born with an underdeveloped right arm after it became trapped under mother Marcia Lee's rib cage as a foetus.

'We found out he was going to be born without his arm at approximately 15 weeks. It was shocking to us. Everybody has their visions of the perfect child. We learned how to get ourselves prepared for a different way of life,' Tommy's father Joe Morrissey told ABC News.

But he learned to catch a ball by the age of 10 months and by two years-old he could hit a golf ball a distance of 65 yards.

'[Adult golfers] look at him and see how small he is and they say, 'Awesome, the little guy can hit a golf ball,' Joe told Fox News.

Staying cool: As soon as he was old enough, Joe and Marcia-Lee, 37, took him down to the Frenchman's Reserve Country Club where they are both members

Putting happy: There you will find all three of them hitting some balls on the driving range or out having lessons

Proud dad Joe said: 'When Tommy is really focused though he can hit the ball 100 yards straight and clean.

'Because of that sometimes it's difficult to remember he's just a toddler.

'Then there are times when we have to go back to a hole because he left his Matchbox cars there.

'He's usually good for about five or six holes and then he wants to ride on the back of the buggy.

'We've had professionals tell us they've never seen anything like it - he really is beyond unique.'
