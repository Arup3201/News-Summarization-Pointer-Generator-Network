Emails posted on the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission website after the Fukushima disaster last March have revealed the agency was kept in the dark about the scale of the crisis.

The correspondence, posted after the earthquake and tsunami caused catastrophic damage to the nuclear plant in Fukushima, Japan, reveals experts in the U.S. disagreed over how to deal with the disaster.

And while assuring the U.S. population that there was no danger, the NRC did not disclose a worst-case scenario which could have seen high levels of radiation affecting Alaska if Fukushima could not be brought under control.

Stricken: Hydrogen explosions causes structural damage to four of the reactors at the plant after the earthquake and tsunami struck on March 11 last year

One email, hours after the magnitude nine earthquake struck off the coast of Japan on March 11, and reported in the Washington Post, said: 'THIS IS NOT A DRILL. This may get really ugly in the next few days.'

Three days later, another official said: 'It's frustrating, but we have very little factual info as an agency.'

The NRC said it was on standby to help Japan cope with the disaster, but struggled to get through 'the fog of information' surrounding the damage at Fukushima, the Post reported.

The emails also reveal experts disagreed on how to advise Tokyo Electric Power Co., which ran the plant. One idea, by physicist Richard Garwin, suggested using a 'shaped' explosion to break through the containment structure of damaged reactors to allow them to be cooled.

'Fog of information': U.S. experts said they were not getting accurate details of the scope of the Fukushima disaster after reactors melted down last year

Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told the Post: 'The emails provide a candid picture of the level of uncertainty and confusion within the U.S. government and indicates that even U.S. experts had major divisions about what was going on and how to best mitigate the crisis.'

The agency was asked by several countries about pools used to house spent nuclear reactor fuel.

At Fukushima, these peoples were either above or next to the reactors and NPR officials were worried they could leak or dry up - causing more radiation to escape.

France, Germany and Japan sought access to NPR information on the pools on March 17, but it was reluctant to share the data over fears of potential attacks on reactors triggered by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Mr Lyman added: 'There is a whole base of information about spent fuel fires and pools that the NRC is not sharing with the public.

'We understand that when you're concerned about terrorist attacks that you want to conceal information, but I don't think there's any reason to maintain such a broad blackout over this type of information.'

Other emails reveal people in the U.S. calling for all nuclear power stations to be temporarily shut so tests could be carried out as well as Freedom of Information Act requests for details of correspondence on Fukushima.

The emails, available on the NRC website, also reveal concerns over a U.S. reactor similar to one of the stricken units at Fukushima.

The agency had been due to issue a licence extension to the Vermont Yankee nuclear reactor on March 16, but postponed it in the wake of the Japan disaster.

A 20-year extension was eventually approved on March 21.

It comes after a secret report by the Japanese government revealed last month that tens of millions of people may have had to be evacuated if the worst-case scenario hit Fukushima.

The 15-page internal document, which was not released over fears of widespread panic, cast doubt on whether the Japanese government could have coped with an evacuation on such an unprecedented scale.

Written on March 25, two weeks after the tsunami devastated the power plant, causing three reactors to melt down and generating hydrogen explosions that blew away protective structures, it revealed contingencies that would have required evacuation orders for residents within a 105-mile radius of the plant, including the whole of Tokyo.
