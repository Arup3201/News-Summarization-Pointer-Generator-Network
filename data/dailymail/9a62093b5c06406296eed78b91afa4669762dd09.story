ABC says it has promoted Lara Spencer to co-host status on Good Morning America.

Spencer, the lifestyle anchor since returning to the show in 2011, now has billing parity with Robin Roberts and George Stephanopoulos.

She was the show's national correspondent from 1999 to 2004. Then, for seven years, she was a host of The Insider.

Promotion: Spencer has been the show's lifestyle anchor since she re-joined GMA in 2011

Spencer's history with the show dates back to 1999, when she was the show's national corespondent before leaving in 2004

'A key member of our on-air team, Lara Spencer, rejoined ABC three years 
ago â€” bringing her style, humor, sunny confidence, wonderful journalism 
and storytelling to GMA,' incoming ABC News chief James Goldston said 
Friday in a memo, obtained by The Daily News, to ABC News staffers.

'Lara is 
clearly an essential ingredient in the success we have enjoyed and I am 
so pleased to announce that Lara has been elevated to co-host of the 
program along with Robin and George.'

Co-host: GMA co-host Robin Roberts recently signed a deal with the network worth up to $18 million a year

Contract: George Stephanopoulos' current contract with the show expires next fall

Her promotion comes as GMA continues to beat NBC's Today show in the ratings, but after it recently lost two members of its team: Sam Champion, who quit the show in December to start his own show on the Weather Channel, and Josh Elliott, who left the show last month for a gig with NBC Sports.

Spencer's new deal is worth about $3 million a year, according to the Daily News.

The promotion for Spencer follows a new deal for Roberts that's said to be worth up to $18 million a year.
