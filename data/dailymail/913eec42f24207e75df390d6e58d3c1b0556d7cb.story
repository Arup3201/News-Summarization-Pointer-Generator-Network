Peeping Toms who ogle women in their most-intimate bathroom moments need no longer worry about the consequences in the hereafter - at least, according to one surprising spiritual authority.

A hardline Islamic preacher from Egypt this week made waves in the Middle East after he issued a religious edict allowing a man to watch a woman 'while she is showering'.

But there is a catch, which is that such voyeurism is only acceptable 'as long as your intentions are pure'.

Go
 forth and ogle! Egyptian cleric Usama al-Qawsi has controversially 
ruled that it's alright by Allah for men to spy on women who are taking a
 shower - as long as they intend to marry her at some point later

What are you doing up there? Peeping Toms can secretly watch women in the shower, as long as they do their ogling with 'pure' intentions

Salafist preacher Usama al-Qawsi made the controversial fatwa in a recent sermon.

His opinion, based on his own, apparently rather special, interpretation of Islam, is that men can 'hide' somewhere 'in secret' in order to see parts of your intended bride 'she wouldn't usually let you see'.

The edict appears to run counter to traditional Muslim teachings, which encourage both men and women dress modestly and 'lower their gaze' when faced with members of the opposite sex.

Mr Qawsi's sermon was broadcast on Egyptian-based Mehwar TV Channel, and they have been translated into English by al-Arabiya. 

He is a representative of the Salafi movement, a minority strain in Egyptian Islam, which encourages believers to look back to the earliest Muslims as the epitome of good religious practice.

He said: 'If you were really honest and wanted to marry that woman, and you were able to hide and watch her in secret, see the things that she wouldn’t usually let you see before marrying her, then it is acceptable as long as your intentions are pure.

'One of the Prophet’s companions did that. Some disapproved and told him: "How do you do that when you’re one of the Prophet’s companions?"

Fatwa: His opinion, based on his own, apparently rather special, interpretation of Islam, is that men can 'hide' somewhere 'in secret' in order to see parts of your intended bride 'she wouldn't usually let you see'

'The Prophet answered: "If you can see something that would make you want to marry her then go ahead and do it."'

Egypt's Minister of Religion, Mohammad Mukhtar, moved quickly to reject the fatwa.

'Where is the glory and masculinity in watching a woman shower?' he was quoted as saying by Al Bawaba, a Jordan-based English-language news network.

'Would you allow this to happen to your daughter? If it was OK with you then it isn’t with the conservative, civilized Muslim and Christian societies – they disapprove of it.

'Besides, Islam preaches that modesty should be in our nature and all religions concur.'
