Manchester United striker Robin van Persie will miss Holland's friendly with Mexico on Wednesday after manager Guus Hiddink confirmed he is 'not quite fit'.

Van Persie captained his country to a third place finish at the World Cup, but Hiddink's side have had a difficult run of form since the tournament, picking up just one win from their first three European Championship qualifiers.

The 31-year-old forward, who played 90 minutes for United against Crystal Palace last weekend, should be back in time to face Latvia on Sunday.

Holland will also be without Bruno Martins Indi and Jordy Classy for Wednesday's game in Amsterdam. 

'Van Persie is not quite fit,' Hiddink told reporters on Tuesday. 'He trained today, but he did not fully participate. I don't think he will be used against Mexico.'

Despite a career constantly interrupted by injuries, Van Persie says he hopes to continue playing for another decade.

Van Persie, who played 90 minutes on Saturday, says he wants to play professionally until he is 40

'I hope that I can play football for as long as possible but I'm aiming for around the age of 40 because I love the game so much,' the Dutch star said in a Facebook Q&A session.

The former Arsenal captain also revealed how seriously he takes his footwear, explaining that he always carries his boots with him when travelling. 

'I am probably the only football player who brings his football boots with him in the plane because I want to make sure that those exact football boots [are] travelling safely and nothing happens to them.'
