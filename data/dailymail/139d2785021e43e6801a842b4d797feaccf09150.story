A barrister yesterday defended the right of journalists to pay whistleblowers for stories in the public interest.

Representing a reporter who faces jail for making the child-killer Jon Venables feel ‘down in the dumps’, John Butterfield QC said: ‘They call it crime – we call it democracy.’

He went on to say: ‘It is necessary and appropriate to reimburse whistleblowers against the risk they are going to get the sack. The issues that this prosecution would seek to trample over are as serious as it gets in a democratic country.’

Speaking of journalists’ role in society, he said: ‘We need them – we need them to be brave. We need them to be pushing at the edges.

‘You don’t have to take it from me. Take it from the children of Rotherham. Utterly, utterly ignored by the authorities, but a campaigning journalist brought it to light.’

He accused the state of trying to ‘clip the wings’ of reporters, telling the Old Bailey that MPs would still ‘have their noses in the trough’ but for the journalists who uncovered the expenses scandal.

He attacked the Crown’s ‘tabloid-bashing’ prosecution of journalists, which he said was driven by ‘rampant snobbery’.

He spoke in the trial of a News of the World reporter, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, and Thomas Savage, 37, deputy news editor of the Daily Star Sunday.

They are accused of paying prison officer Scott Chapman, 42, thousands for information on Venables, the infamous killer of James Bulger, while he was in jail for child porn offences in 2010. Chapman funnelled the money through his ex Lynn Gaffney, 40, the court heard.

Describing the articles published about Venables, Mr Butterfield said: ‘Evil – monster – fiend. Yes, it is tabloid-speak. You tell me which of those words can’t be justified.

‘[The prosecution] have described the articles as drivel. It is drivel, is it, that he enjoys conditions which would make other prisoners green with envy?’

John Ryder QC, for Savage, said the stories about Venables were ‘entirely legitimate’.

The News of the World reporter had previously told the court that exposing the killer’s ‘comfortable’ prison lifestyle was more important than sparing the feelings of a man who had done ‘despicable things’.

He said the state was ‘protecting the child murderer and confirmed paedophile Jon Venables from feeling a bit down in the dumps’.

Mr Butterfield said that the articles written about Venables had been ‘handsomely justified in the public interest’.

But he added: ‘There is a massive contrast in public interest, between the prosecution and the defence.

‘They call it crime. We call it democracy. Democracy in action.’

He said payment for stories was ‘a necessary article for the press to have in their armoury’.

The News of the World reporter denies knowing Chapman was a prison officer. Both journalists deny conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office.

Chapman and Gaffney, both of Corby, Northamptonshire, deny misconduct in a public office.

Chapman is said to have more than doubled his £29,000 salary selling stories to the News of the World, The Sun, the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror, The People, the Daily Star and the Daily Star Sunday between March 2010 and June 2011. The trial continues.

The trial continues.
