The 24th Bond film, Spectre, is due to start filming in the Austrian Triol over the next few weeks.  

Daniel Craig, along with other stars from the cast and crew, will be arriving in the ski resort of Sölden, in the Ӧtztal and Obertilliach, in the East Tirol region.

Those who book in time might catch a glimpse of Daniel Craig, playing Bond for the forth time, darting about the alpine landscape. 

Filming for the 24th Bond film is due to start in the Austrian town of Obertilliach in the next few weeks, causing great excitement in the area

As the largest film production ever to be made in Tirol, the news is understandably causing a bit of a stir. Local authorities hope it will bring immediate economic benefits to the region and create future film-tourism opportunities.

Other Spectre cast members include Ralph Fiennes, Christoph Waltz, Monica Bellucci and Lea Seydoux, with Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes (of American Beauty, Revolutionary Road and James Bond - Skyfall).

Since January this year suitable filming locations for these scenes were surveyed around the world, including in Norway and Italy. 

Eventually, help from a mixture of the Location Austria (FISA Film Location Austria), local communities, tourist boards and mountain railway companies helped swing the balance in Tirol's favour.

As a result Sam Mendes chose the locations of Oetztal and East Tirol to film.

In August the production office was set up in Sölden, ready to co-ordinate the planned filming, which is scheduled to take place from mid-January to February 2015.

A total of 22 filming days is planned in the Tirol, and at its peak the film crew will consist of 500 people, including 150 local filmmakers covering various positions. A total of 26,000 overnight stays will be generated for the region.

The immediate economic effect will be large. It is estimated that – taking into account  production costs, accommodation and meals, as well as transportation and the salaries of local Tirolean filmmakers – €6 million, around £5million, will be spent in Tirol.

'I am very excited that the joint efforts, help and support will result in the most famous secret agent in the world on location in Ötztal and East Tirol,' says Josef Margreiter, Founder of Cine Tirol.

'The last Bond film, Skyfall, was watched by over 130 million in cinemas around the world. This fills us with great confidence that the action-packed scenes for the new Bond film will be seen by an audience of millions when the film is released in Autumn 2015 and that will make people want to visit the locations for themsleves in the Heart of the Alps.'

Tirol is surrounded by Lienz dolomites and two large Austrian mountains: the Großglockner (12,500ft) and Großvenediger (12,000ft)

A total of 22 filming days is planned in the Tirol, and at its peak the film crew will consist of 500 people, including 150 local filmmakers

Cine Tirol Director, Johannes Köck, reiterates: 'James Bond in Tirol is the ultimate accolade for Cine Tirol, as the driving force for the region of Tirol as a filming location: this movie will draw the attention of the entire film industry to our region and help facilitate the acquisition of further international follow-up projects.

He also adds: 'Even though this will be the first time that agent 007 will be filmed in Tirol, there is an enduring connection between the most famous secret agent of all time and our region. Ian Fleming, the author of the Bond novels, lived in Kitzbühel in the 1920s and studied at a private school.'

Solden in Oetztal is one of the most snow-sure ski areas in the Alps thanks to it's glacier but visitors can also enjoy hikes and tobogganing

Solden is one of the most snow-sure ski areas in the Alps thanks to its glacier and has over 140km of slopes. The idyllic resort is surrounded by Lienz dolomites with the two largest mountains in Austria; the impressive Großglockner 12,500ft (3,798 m) and  Großvenediger 12,000ft (3,674 m). It's also remained largely unspoiled by mass tourism, unlike elsewhere in the Alps.

Alongside carving deep turns into pisted slopes, winter visitors can toboggan, hike or enjoy one of the resorts many restaurants.  

East Tirol borders the states of Carinthia in the east and Salzburg in the north, while it also shares borders with the Italian provinces of South Tirolin the west and Belluno (Region of Veneto) in the south.
