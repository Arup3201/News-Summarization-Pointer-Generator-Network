The mother of a teenage tennis star who was left with blood streaming down her face after being hit by her father for losing a match has launched an astonishing defence of her husband.

Umpires called the police after Ioana Andrada Surdeanu, a 16-year-old Romanian junior player, was injured by her father Lucian, who is also her coach, when she crashed out of a girls' tournament in Israel.

Miss Surdeanu, who had reached the quarter final of the International Tennis Federation Tournament, screamed when her father hit her as 'punishment' for losing against the favourite to win the competition, witnesses said.

Amazingly Alina Surdeanu said her husband Lucian had been treated like a 'common criminal' adding that the incident was regrettable but he had never hit the teen before 

Both Alina and her husband Lucian complained about his treatment by Israeli investigators. Her daughter Ioana has also defended her father

But instead of defending her daughter, Alina Surdeanu sided with her 47-year-old husband and complained about his treatment by Israeli police investigating the incident. 

'It was regrettable that he lost his temper,' she said. 'He has never hit her before, this is the first time. There were arguments before because they're both very temperamental. 

Using her daughter's middle name she added: 'Andrada wants to succeed very much, and when her game is bad, she gets angry.' 

Bemoaning Lucian's arrest, she said he had been 'handcuffed on both his hands and ankles and led away like a common criminal in front of everyone.'

After being told his daughter had a broken nose she said he 'was worried for her' and had wanted to see his daughter, only to be refused his request by investigators.   

'He pleaded guilty,' she said. 'He was in tears over his thoughtless gesture, but despite his clear remorse they did not give in. In fact, the police extended the investigation without any reason. 'He was not allowed to phone.'

'Each day he was moved to a different cell, with other prisoners. He did not even see daylight until a week later.'

She added that she had only found out the full story on her husband's return to Romania.  

 As for Ioana, she said her daughter was feeling 'guilty' about the incident and that her husband had sacrificed his military career so he could coach his daughter when she was five-years-old. 

'He went with her to tournaments and took care of the financial side,' she said. 'Nobody helps us, the parent's of players are the ones who invest in tennis in Romania.' 

Alina's views were echoed by her daughter, who said it was normal for him to 'punish' her after matches, usually by taking her phone.

The fledgling tennis star said: 'I didn't play well in that match. At the end, he went to confiscate my phone. That's the way he punishes me when it is my fault and I don't win matches. I was annoyed and I threw the phone at him and said "take it". 

'Of course he didn't catch it, and he got angry because of the way I've behaved. He pushed me and slapped me twice. One of the slaps hit my nose.

'I sat down on my knees, and I put my hands on my face so he would not be able to hit me again. I had a little blood, I was scared and shaking.

'He gave me a wet towel and said that I should go to the tournament's doctor. When I came back, he was already kicked out from the tennis court and they told me he had been sent to the hotel.'

'By the time I got to the hotel, they had already arrested him. The umpires took me to the police station. On our way, we stopped near a police car. It had bars on the back seat and when I looked inside I saw my dad.'

Miss Surdeanu defended her father, saying she 'deserved' to be punished after her defeat

Mr Surdeanu was given a £237 fine for hitting his daughter and has reportedly returned home

Despite needing treatment from a doctor to stem the blood pouring from her nose, Miss Surdeanu, ranked 249th in the world, tearfully defended her father.

'At the police station they didn't let me see him, like he was dangerous and I had to stay away from him.

'My father is not a beast, he didn't break my nose, I didn't have my face covered in blood. It's true, he slapped me. But so what? I deserved it. 

'It was my fault because I've yelled and said some bad words to him. I was irresponsible after all the sacrifices he made for me. I admit that I was scared in that moment he hit me, but I know he regrets what he did and he loves me as much as I love him. 

'He maybe exaggerated a little, but he didn't deserve to be arrested. I'm worried for him. I want to continue this journey in tennis with the support of the whole family.

'When I read that he is described as a "criminal" and a "beast", I feel like I want to scream. I feel guilty for what is happening.'

Mr Surdeanu was given a £237 fine and has reportedly returned home to Romania.

Showing little remorse for the incident he claimed that his time in an Israeli jail had left him with skin disease and lice. 

'For me, Israel no longer exists on the map,' he said, adding that he would never return to the country.   

Tough: Richard Williams, father of Serena and Venus, brought them up in Compton, California, to give them a 'fighter's mentality'

1) Richard Williams, father of Serena and Venus, admitted that he brought up his daughters in the notorious neighbourhood of Compton, California, to give them 'a fighter's mentality'.

He took them to the courts when they were just four years old, later realising that he should have waited until they were at least six.

He says the motto he drilled into them from an early age was:  ‘You got to be rough, you’ve got to be tough and you’ve got to be strong.'

2) John Tomic, the father and coach of Bernard Tomic, headbutted his son's hitting partner, breaking the player's nose after a row on a training court in Madrid.

Despite this, he said: 'I don't feel guilty, I didn't do anything wrong.'

3) Damir Dokic, father of Jelena Dokic, bizarrely threatened to assassinate the Australian ambassador to Serbia and was ejected from Wimbledon in 2000 for breaking a journalist's camera.

The father of the tennis star also hit the headlines after saying he would kill himself if his daughter was a lesbian. 

4) Jim Pierce, father of retired player Mary Pierce, shouted at her daughter to 'kill the b****' during a tournament.

In 1993, Ms Pierce obtained a restraining order from her father, who had verbally abused her.

His outbursts were so bad that he was eventually banned from Women's Tennis Association matches. 

5) Croatian player Mirjana Lucic said she left her home with her mother and four siblings to escape her abusive father Marinko.

He told the Telegraph: 'I never used excessive force, and if I did give her the occasional slap, it was because of her behaviour; I did what I believed what was best for the child.'
