At least three miners have been killed and up to 30 are missing after an illegal gold mine collapsed in southwest Colombia.

The pit, in a rural area near Santander de Quilichao, caved in at around midnight last night after a tunnel wall buckled, trapping workers underground.

But as dawn broke this morning, hopes of finding survivors were beginning to fade after three bodies were pulled from the rubble. So far, three injured miners have been rescued.

Prayers: Hundreds of villagers look on as rescuers attempt to clear rubble in the hope they may find survivors

Hopes: The pit, in a rural area near Santander de Quilichao, caved in at around midnight last night after one of the walls of a tunnel buckled, trapping the workers underground

Illegal: Colombia has more than 14,000 mines, more than half of which operate without proper permits, officials said

Fading hopes: As dawn broke this morning, hopes of finding survivors were beginning to fade after three bodies were pulled from the rubble and three injured people

Safety fears: Colombia has been blighted by a string of mining disasters, sparking calls for an overhaul of safety laws and a crackdown on illegal mines

As anguished relatives looked on from behind a security perimeter 24 hours after the tragedy, six backhoes clawed at the earth to try to get to the missing.

Incredibly,
initial rescue efforts were hampered because the owners of the mine, rather than use their own equipment to try and 
rescue the missing, hid it to keep it from being seized because they had
 no permit, Mining and Energy Minister Amylkar Acosta said.

'We arrived at the scene and managed to remove three bodies,' said Victor Claros, head of the firefighters in the Colombia's Cauca state, where the disaster took place. 

But Claros could offer little hope for those who were not pulled to safety immediately after the cave-in, saying that some of the workers were buried under 20 meters (60 feet) of earth.

'It is impossible that anyone could have survived,' Claros said. 'There is too much earth and rocks and mud.'

Rescue 
workers were waiting for the heavy machinery to remove enough mud to 
send in sniffer dogs. But they said lots of earth still had to be shifted before this would be possible.

Big business: Colombia produces some 66 metric tons of gold per year, equating to $33billion in exports

Rising demand: The past five years have seen revenue from gold exports increase 10-fold, according to government data

The rescue effort has gripped the surrounding communities in the rural region

Joint effort: Police, troops, civil defense and the Red Cross were aiding in rescue efforts

Wildcat mining: Mining accidents are common in Colombia, especially at wildcat mines in poverty-stricken areas dominated by criminal gangs with little state presence

To make 
matters worse, the number of missing could rise because so far the list is based on reports from relatives and there are concerns others may not yet 
have come forward.

Colombia has been luring gold prospectors since Spanish conquistadors pursued the mythical city of El Dorado.

After a decline in recent decades, the industry has surged over the past five years, with exports now totalling around $33billion annually.

It has become so lucrative that paramilitary guerrillas and drug gangs (known as 'Bacrims') are increasingly turning to illegal gold mining to fund their terrorist acts.

Fuelled by the government's crackdown on the drugs trade and a steady increase in metals prices in recent years, this new trend has seen a fivefold jump in gold prices over the last decade.

Cocaine is no longer a sufficient source of funding for 8,000-member FARC (pictured on a training exercise) because distribution - the most lucrative side of the cocaine market - is now largely controlled by Mexican cartels.

It is, therefore, easier for rebel bands and criminal gangs to operate an illegal mine than a coca field.

Foreign and local groups fighting for the rights of the region's indigenous inhabitants estimate that there are as many as 4,000 illegal miners working in the area near the borders with Colombia and Brazil.

Luz Holanda Nazarin, 50, whose nephew was among the missing, said she had given up hope.

'Not even God knows where they are,' she said.

Cauca province Gov. Temistocles Ortega said illegal miners use machinery to open huge holes to extract gold, often without providing the necessary structural support.

Police, troops, civil defense and the Red Cross were aiding in rescue efforts in the mine, which is about 190 miles southwest of Bogota, the capital.

Mining accidents are common in Colombia, especially at wildcat mines in poverty-stricken areas dominated by criminal gangs with little state presence.

Colombia has been blighted by a string of mining disasters, sparking calls for an overhaul of safety laws and a crackdown on illegal quarries.

Less than a week ago, four people were killed inhaling noxious gases following an explosion at a mine in Antioquia province that continued to operate in defiance of an order to close.

Eduardo Otoya, vice president of corporate affairs at the company Continental Gold, told Radio Santa Fe that the explosion was caused by an industrial material popularly called 'crazy dust,' which generates highly toxic gases and has already claimed several lives in the gold mining zone.

Last year, nine miners died after floods trapped them in an underground coal mine in northern Colombia when a subterranean water deposit ruptured and inundated the shaft 200 metres underground.

In a region rich in gold, South America has seen a rise in wildcat mines, accused of tearing down rainforests and polluting 
rivers with tonnes of toxic mercury, which they use to separate gold 
from ore.

Colombia has more than 14,000 mines, more than half of which operate without proper permits, officials said.

In Colombia there are fears that left-wing guerrillas and former paramilitaries are profiting from illegal mining.

Colombia has been luring gold prospectors since Spanish conquistadors pursued the mythical city of El Dorado.

In the 19th century, the country was among the world’s largest producers of gold, thanks to its abundant supply.

But
 decades of gang warfare and administrational disarray slipped the 
country down the global rankings. However, the past five years have seen
 revenue from gold exports increase 10-fold, according to government 
data.

Colombia produces some 66 metric tons of gold per year, equating to $33billion in exports.

Its two largest producers are Mineros 
SA (MINEROS), based in Medellin, and Gran Colombia Gold Corp. (GCM), 
based in Toronto. They account for 10 to 15 per cent of the country’s 
output.

The rest comes from 
smaller legal endeavours, mining firms that have worked the same area 
for generations tax free and without permits and those with links to 
criminal or rebel groups, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia, or FARC.

In darkness: Rescue workers remove sludge during the rescue last night

In 
Guainia province, in Colombia’s eastern Amazon jungle, unlicensed miners
 use makeshift barges to pan for gold from along the Inirida River.

Colonel Hector Paez, acting director 
of the country’s rural police division, has said that current profits 
from illegal gold mining are five times greater than returns from 
cocaine for rebels groups operating in Colombia.

'A kilogram of cocaine can sell for about 2,570 in the Colombian jungle, while a kilogram of gold can fetch 19 times that, or similar to global market prices,' he said.

Gold has become Colombia’s main export after oil and coal.
