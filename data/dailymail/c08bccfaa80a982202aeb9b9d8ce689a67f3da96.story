The first Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States is now in critical condition, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas said on Saturday.

Thomas Eric Duncan, who was diagnosed on Sunday, had previously been described as being in serious condition.

He is being treated in an isolation ward.

Duncan had helped transport a pregnant woman suffering from Ebola to a hospital in Liberia, where she was turned away for lack of space.

He then helped bring the woman back to her family's home and carried her into the house, where she later died. 

Four other men who had contact with the woman, whose name is believed to be Marthalene Williams, died soon after as well.

Four days later Duncan flew to the United States, lying on his questionnaire about having any contact with an infected person before he left Liberia.

There are still roughly 50 people being monitored after having come into contact with Duncan, 10 of whom are considered at 'high risk.' 

The disease can hide in the human system for up to 21 days.

This all comes as CDC officials rushed to Newark Airport earlier today to meet a man on a flight from Brussels who was vomiting and 'showing signs of Ebola.'

That man, who was also believed to have been from Liberia, was ultimately found to be not contagious according to ABC News.
