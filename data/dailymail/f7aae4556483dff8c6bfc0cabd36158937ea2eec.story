Arsenal forward Joel Campbell has asked manager Arsene Wenger for permission to join Benfica on loan, according to press reports in Portugal.

O Jogo reported on Sunday that Campbell believes there will be few chances at the Emirates this season to be leading Arsenal’s attack.

As a result Campbell has asked to go on loan to Benfica to gain regular first team football.

Crisis: Olivier Giroud is out until January and so Campbell is needed as an option up front for Wenger's Gunners

However Wenger has confirmed he wants to keep Campbell for the 2014-15 campaign, especially with his attacking options depleted by the injury of Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud is set to be out until January.

Campbell has spent all three years of his Arsenal career on loan at Lorient, Real Betis and Olympiacos, but Wenger now views the 22-year-old as part of his plans, since returning from a successful World Cup with Costa Rica.

'We've had lots of enquiries and turned them down. There have been plenty of clubs interested, but I don't know how many,' said Wenger.

'Once I say to my assistant he won't go out on loan, even if people ask about him, my assistant doesn't even tell me. When I say no it's no.

'He's definitely a target and a player who is wanted by many clubs.'

Form: Campbell shone during the World Cup for Costa Rica and has been the subject of 'lots of enquiries'
