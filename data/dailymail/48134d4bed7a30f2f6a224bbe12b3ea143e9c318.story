A six-year-old girl and her three-year-old brother have been abandoned at a kindergarten centre in China after their parents said they cannot afford to take them home.

Lin and her brother Yan were left at the playgroup in Luoyang city, Henan province by mother He Tuan, 32, and father He Liu, 37, with enough money for two weeks of teaching and board.

But two months later the couple have not been back to collect the children, and police say they are powerless to act after the parents disappeared recently.

Lin, six (right) and her brother Yan, three (left), have been abandoned by their parents at a kindergarten centre in Henan province, China, for the last two months

Workers at the centre say mother He Tuan, 32, and father He Liu, 37, dropped the children off with enough money for two weeks teaching and board, but have not been back since

Repeated calls to the parents have produced no results, with authorities saying the duo always come up with a reason why they cannot take their children back.

A police spokesman added: 'They say they cannot afford to take them back.'

In the meantime staff at the kindergarten group are taking it in turns to look after the children at their homes at the weekends, a leaving them at the centre during the week.

Lee Zhang, the owner and operator of the nursery, said: 'The two parents owe the kindergarten thousands. I don’t anticipate they will pay it back, I just hope that they can take their kids home.'

Police have spoken to the parents, but they say they are too poor to take the children back and officers say they are powerless to act

Nursery workers have been taking it in turns to let the children stay at their houses on the weekends when the centre is closed, but leaving them there during the week

One day Zhang bumped into the two parents in the street and asked them 
to take their children home. The parents promised that they would go to 
pick them up that day -  but disappeared again.

Zhang 
reported the case to police. According to police’s investigation, the 
two parents once sent their daughter to a kindergarten and owed that 
kindergarten about 2,000 RMB (£190).

The two parents live in a rented
 flat and are known to be behind with the rent.

Under China's draconian one-child policy parents must pay for their children's schooling if they have more than one baby, which can amount to many times the average salary

'We have 
great financial problems,' the mother told Zhang. 'We do not intend to abandon
 our children forever, but we cannot afford to look after them by 
ourselves now.

'They are in  the best place. I promise we will pay all 
the debts in the future.'

Under China's draconian one-child policy, parents receive free schooling and childcare for their firstborn, but if they have a second baby, they must pay for both, which can cost many times the average yearly salary.
