'Never heard of it': Judge Heather Norton expressed astonishment that the prisoner had been sent on a sleep course

A judge has expressed  her astonishment after  being told how a violent prisoner had taken a course on ‘how to get a good night’s sleep’ in his jail cell.

Heroin addict Paul Richards,  45, was given classes on how to meditate and develop a healthy sleeping pattern while on remand for assaulting his partner and  possessing drugs.

The lessons include advice on the importance of regular bedtimes and taking exercise.

Richards’s lawyer, Oliver Kirk, told  Canterbury Crown Court the treatment was designed to help drug users and alcoholics learn to tell the ‘difference between night and day’.

But judge Heather Norton, who  was handed a certificate to show Richards had passed the ‘sleep course’, said she had ‘never heard’ of such a programme.

She said: ‘This is the first time I have ever heard of someone learning to sleep in their cell.

‘I have never ever heard of anything like this being offered to prisoners.’

Richards, of Dover, was arrested in January last year and jailed because he had a suspended sentence hanging over him for an earlier attack on his partner.

He was sent on the course at Elmley prison, on the Isle of Sheppey, while awaiting trial for the attack on Lisa Kennett, which left her ‘terrified for her life’ and with injuries to her  face and body.

At the court hearing, Mr Kirk explained that the course ‘is designed to help prisoners meditate and get into a good sleeping routine in their cells and assist them with addressing their drug or alcohol abuse’. He added that many people depending on addictive substances ‘needed help understanding the need to get a good night’s sleep’.

Judge Norton replied: ‘That’s news both to me and my fellow judges here at Canterbury Crown Court.’

The therapy encourages prisoners to go to bed at ‘regular times’ and to ‘exercise regularly’ and teaches them that alcohol is a stimulant which doesn’t help them sleep well.

Richards admitted common  assault, possession of cannabis and resisting arrest, and was jailed for eight months.

Prosecutor Jim Harvey said the attack against Miss Kennett was the second assault she had been subjected to during the stormy relationship, which the court heard she wished to resume.

In 2010 it emerged that violent prisoners at Shepton Mallet jail, in Somerset, were given yoga courses to teach them how to relax using ‘Taoist meditation breath work’.

And at Portland prison in Dorset, inmates have been taught to control the movement of horses ‘simply by using body language and attitude’ in the hope that developing skills such as communication and empathy would help stop them reoffending.
