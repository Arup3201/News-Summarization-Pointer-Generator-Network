A fifth of Android users are ditching their devices in favour of Apple's iPhone according to a U.S report.

The Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIPR) survey also found that people
with Apple devices are younger, richer and have more masters degrees or 
doctorates compared to people who own Samsung phones.

Figures also show that Apple took 33 per cent more customers away from Samsung during the period of June 2012 to June 2013 than Samsung took from Apple.

A fifth of people are ditching their Samsung devices, such as the Galaxy S3 right, for an Apple iPhone, left, according to a report by the Consumer Intelligence Research Partners group in the U.S. The report also found that Apple owners are younger, more educated and earn more money than other smartphone users

Around 20 per cent of new Apple customers previously owned an Android device, while only 7 per cent of Samsung buyers previously owned an iPhone. Samsung was more popular with people who had never bought a smartphone before with 37 per cent of people upgrading their basic phones to Samsung models

iPhone owners are vainer and spend more on clothes and grooming than those who have BlackBerrys and Android phones, according to research from TalkTalk Mobile.  

BlackBerry owners earn the most and are more likely to have long-term relationships, while people with Android handsets have the best manners and are handy in the kitchen.

The study surveyed 2,000 owners of the three major smartphone brands to determine whether the choice of handset was an extension of their personality.

The results come from quarterly CIPR surveys that asked 500 people who had bought a phone in the previous 90 days.

They asked the participants about their age, income, education, previous handset and new device.

Figures revealed that 20 per cent of new Apple iPhone customers had previously owned an Android device, while only 7 per cent of Samsung buyers have previously owned an iPhone.

However, Samsung was more popular with people who had never bought a smartphone before with 37 per cent of people upgrading their basic phones to Samsung models, compared to 26 per cent who chose Apple.

The majority of Apple iPhone owners, 69 per cent, were under 34, while more than a third of iPhone customers had masters degrees and earned between £75,000 and £150,000 a year.

The report also found that people who previously owned a BlackBerry were more inclined to switch to an Apple device, whereas HTC and Nokia owners preferred to upgrade to Samsung.

In July Samsung overtook Apple in terms of marketshare and shipped double the amount of handsets.

Apple’s share of the smartphone market dropped to 14 per cent, its lowest for three years, because of ‘lacklustre’ iPhone 5 sales and tougher competition from rivals, according to industry analysts.

The majority of Apple iPhone owners, 69 per cent, were aged between 18 and 34. More than a third of iPhone customers had masters degrees and earned between £75,000 and £150,000 a year

Driven by demand for cheaper Android devices in Asia and Latin America, Samsung’s handset  division made an estimated £3.4billion operating profit in the second quarter of this year.

The company was also said to have made 27.7 per cent of all phones sold during the second quarter of this year.

In the same month, Samsung beat Apple to take the top spot in a customer satisfaction survey in the U.S, too.

Two of its handsets - the Galaxy S III and the Galaxy Note II - tied in first and second place in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ASCI) ahead of Apple's iPhone 5, iPhone 4S and iPhone 4.

The CIPR survey also found that people with Apple devices have more masters degrees or doctorates compared to people who own Samsung phones

The survey scored phones, and ultimately brands, on anticipation of quality compared to the product's actual quality, reliability, as well as price and perceived value.

Samsung's Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II both scored 84 out of a possible 100.

Apple's iPhone 5 and 4S tied in third and fourth with 82 points, while the iPhone 4 scored 81.

Motorola Mobility's Droid Razr Maxx HD handset gave the Google-owned company sixth place with a score of 80 and its Droid Razr was in eighth with 77.

Samsung's Galaxy SII scored 78, in seventh place. BlackBerry took ninth and tenth place with the BlackBerry Curve scoring 67 and the BlackBerry Bold on 64.
