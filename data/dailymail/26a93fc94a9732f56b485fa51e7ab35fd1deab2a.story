David Cameron’s pledge to force GP surgeries to stay open seven days a week will be impossible to deliver without hiring thousands of new doctors, health experts said today.

The Prime Minister said everyone would have access to a GP every day of the week by 2020, with surgeries opening from 8am to 8pm.

But doctors' leaders warned that GPs were already stretched to breaking point because of staff shortages and NHS cuts.

The Prime Minister will unveil a revolution in the family doctor service, so that busy patients will no longer struggle to fit in visits to their GP with childcare and work commitments 

Mr Cameron insisted significant additional funds and staffing would be introduced to meet the pledge.

He said 12 hour surgery opening hours and weekend appointments were already in place for seven million patients after the launch last year of a £50 million fund in selected surgeries.

The PM annuonced a further £100 million to ensure that at least 10 million people are covered in 2015, and a further £400million is earmarked to make the extended service nationwide over the five years following next May's election.

But Dr Richard Vautry, a GP and spokesman for the British Medical Association, said: ‘GPs are under huge pressure at the moment and we can't sustain the current service, let alone stretch it to a seven-day service, without significant extra funding and more importantly significant extra staff.’

Under the Government's plan doctors will be required to band together so that they can take it in turns to open at weekends – giving all patients access to a GP on Saturdays and Sundays.

Mr Cameron and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt revealed the proposal – which will cost £400million over the next five years – at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today.

The reforms are a response to growing concern over the quality of out-of-hours care. Labour’s 2004 contract allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for patients outside office hours and at weekends.

But while the plans will be welcomed by patients, doctors themselves are likely to warn that there simply are not enough staff to open at weekends and keep the level of service the same during the week.

There will also be concerns that practices will simply employ expensive locum GPs to cover the extra opening hours.

As well as seven-day-a-week access and evening opening hours, Mr Cameron said family doctors will also be encouraged to try out services to suit modern lifestyles, such as greater use of Skype, email and phone consultations. They will also offer electronic prescriptions and online booking of appointments and registration.

And every patient will be given a named GP responsible for their care outside hospital.

The Prime Minister said: ‘People need to be able to see their GP at a time that suits them and their family. That’s why we will make sure everyone can see a GP seven days a week by 2020.

‘We will also support thousands more GP practices to stay open longer – giving millions of patients better access to their doctor.’

Mr Cameron first signalled the reforms last year, when he unveiled a £50million fund for 20 groups of GPs to develop ways to improve access for 7.5million patients.

Today he will say that, from April 2015, the Government will invest a further £100million into the fund. This will allow a second wave of pilot schemes.

Not all surgeries will open at weekends. Instead, practices will band together and agree to take turns to open at weekends – seeing all patients from all their lists. A source said: ‘We are not being prescriptive about this. We want to see practices joining together in hubs, to ensure all the patients on their lists have access to a GP surgery at the weekend.

‘So it might not be your GP who is open, but there will be one down the road.’

However, when the pilots were launched last year, some doctors warned that the plan would be ‘undeliverable’.

Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctor Association, said: ‘It’s not realistic to talk about GP services opening from 8 until 8, seven days a week – that’s the bottom line.’

Later today NHS England will publish the revised GP contract, which will include the return of a ‘named GP’.

It means every person in the country will have a named family doctor who is responsible for their care outside hospital.
