The BBC has signed up Channel 4 star Peter Kay to appear in his first sitcom for the corporation which will air from beginning to end on its iPlayer service before going on to BBC1.

The series, about two people who meet through a company car share scheme, will be the first to be shown in its entirety on the service before going on one of the major channels.

Car Share, which is also directed by the comedian, is one of the most high profile BBC programmes that has been put online ahead of its traditional TV broadcast.

The move is seen as significant as there has been talk that in the future many people will watch TV through their computers and that so-called ‘linear’ channels will die out as people choose to when to watch programmes.

Today’s announcement comes after the BBC Trust last month approved plans for a trial of up to 12 months to allow up to 40 hours of programming ‘across a range of genres’ to be shown online before going on normal channels.

The six part series, filmed in the north west, stars Mr Kay alongside Sian Gibson.

They play John and Kayleigh who have been put together in a car share scheme for their jobs at an out of town supermarket. Each journey ‘brings fresh insight’ into their lives and follows the ‘twists and turns in their unlikely relationship’.

Mr Kay has in recent years has predominantly associated with Channel 4 with shows such as That Peter Kay Thing in 2000, Phoenix Nights and its spin-off, Max & Paddy’s Road To Nowhere.

The BBC said the programme was part of its strategy to ‘showcase’ a wider ‘breadth and range’ of TV content on BBC iPlayer.

The BBC has already run a series of BBC3 online comedy pilots on the internet. One of these, Impractical Jokers, was turned into a series for the channel.

BBC1 controller Danny Cohen said: ‘It is hugely exciting that Peter Kay is coming to BBC One with his new series - even more so with the innovative plan we have to launch the show online.’

BBC controller of comedy commissioning Shane Allen added: ‘Everyone adores Peter. It’s bold and exciting for him to head in a more naturalistic comedy direction with this project. It will be a nifty new addition to his incredible body of work and the way it is being launched is very canny.

Peter Kay said: ‘To be finally working with the BBC on a new comedy is a great opportunity. And the idea of two people car sharing to work each day really appealed to me, as it highlights the comedy in the minutia of the daily trek and allows the spiralling conversations of life to unwind in all of their glory.’
