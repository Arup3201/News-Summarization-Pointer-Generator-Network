It's a bittersweet first birthday for little Aurora Sky.

On this day a year ago, the dark-haired infant was born three months premature by emergency Cesarean section just minutes before her mother, Brandi Lepine, died.

Lepine, 17, and her friend Taylor Litwin, 21, were killed when an alleged drunk driver smashed their car as they drove to 7-Eleven for a slurpee in Canada.

Now disabled Aurora is being cared for by her maternal grandmother, Josephine Ledoux, who said goodbye to her daughter and welcomed a granddaughter on the same night.

Heartbreaking: Baby Aurora was born three months premature, weighing slightly more than two pounds, and suffered a head injury during the car wreck while still inside her mother's womb

'It’s a gift, because she’s (Aurora's) come so far and it’s going to be a year tomorrow. And she has fought a lot, just to be here today,' Ledoux told CKOM.

'It’s kind of hard for me because 
honestly my daughter isn’t here to celebrate her baby’s first birthday 
and that’s what’s hard for me to understand... But at least
 family will be around her, and friends, and she knows that she’s loved.'

Even though she was still in the womb, little Aurora suffered a serious head injury in the collision.

Weighing slightly more than two pounds, she spent five months in Saskatoon’s Royal University Hospital, where doctors placed a shunt in her head to drain fluid from brain.

Now at her grandmother's Prince Albert home, she is connected to an oxygen tank and takes medication every day. She can't walk or crawl, and can barely hold her head up on her own.

Doctors say she will likely have some form of disability for the rest of her life.

'People say she's (Aurora) lucky to have us, but no, we're lucky to have her in our lives,' Ledoux told CTV News.

'I don't care how she turns out ... To my eyes she's beautiful. She's a gift and we're very blessed.'

Last week, Ledoux attended the preliminary trial for the allegedly drunk driver who crashed into her daughter's car.

Jeremiah Jobb, 22, is facing several charges including impaired driving causing death.

Family members of the victims were outraged when Jobb was granted bail in August last year.

CKOM reported one member of the family pounded the walls and screamed in the halls of a Prince Albert courtroom when Judge Morris Baniak released Jobb.

As a condition of his bail, the judge ordered that Jobb remain at his mother's home and only leave to go to work.

He was also forbidden from drinking alcohol or going anywhere where he could buy booze.

Police said Jobb was drunk when he crashed his car.

Litwin died at the scene while Lepine was rushed to hospital where she died.

The best friends were on their way to a 7Eleven to satisfy a hankering for a slushy drink.

Days later, Lepine and Litwin were buried side by side under a tree at a local cemetery.

Litwin's griefstricken mother, Bev Gobeil, said she still struggles with her daughter's death and can't imagine how Ledoux is coping with a special-needs child.

'I don't know how that woman can do it, man. She's got to be strong,' Gobeil told CTV News.

'It would be hard to handle that baby. Every day you think of your girl.'

Both families have planned a potluck supper tonight at a church to remember the young women and celebrate Aurora's birthday.

Victim: Brandi Lepine's friend Taylor Litwin, 21 (pictured) was also killed in the horrific 14 July, 2013, car crash

'I'll never forget my daughter,' Ledoux said. 'I'll never forget her smile, her laughter, her silliness. The one
 thing I miss the most is her just hugging me and just kissing me really
 hard on the face and saying, 'I love you Mom'.'

She said she will never keep Aurora in the dark about her mother.

'She's not ever going to know her mom but I will tell her stories and show her pictures. That's all I can do,' she said.

Ledoux said her quiet but headstrong daughter dropped out of high school when she found out she was pregnant, but vowed to return after the baby was born.  Ledoux promised her daughter, who had broken up with her boyfriend, that she and her husband would raise the baby.
