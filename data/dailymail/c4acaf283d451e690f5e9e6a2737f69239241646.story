These adorable toddlers may be two of the most pampered infants in Britain.

Scarlett Jacobs, two, and sister Savannah, one, have already been lavished with £45,000 worth of designer clothes, expensive toys and lucrative holidays.

Mother Faye Jacobs has splashed out £7,000 on an extravagant designer wardrobe including labels like Diesel and Ralph Lauren.

And according to the 30-year-old, oldest daughter Scarlett is already a fashion snob who puts even Suri Cruise to shame.

The style conscious two-year-old turns her nose up at Primark clothes and is happiest when riding in style in father Paul’s Porsche.

Faye invests in quality for Scarlett and her sister Savannah, one, and wouldn’t dream of buying ‘cheap’ shoes from Next or M&S.

Instead their dainty feet are clad in Hunter wellies, Ugg boots or pricy Russell and Bromley numbers.

The jet-setting toddlers have travelled to exotic destinations like Dubai and Cape Town, and only stay in five star hotels with Michelin starred restaurants on site.

Their designer suitcases are stuffed full of little Ralph Lauren dresses, Juicy Couture tops, Angel’s Face tutus and silk Merino Kids pajamas and already Scarlett knows the difference between high-end and high street.

Faye, a freelance digital marketing 
consultant: 'Scarlett’s turned into a total snob already. She sort of 
looks at some clothes and won’t even dare pick them up.

'We’ve
 bought her clothes from Primark but it will be Peppa Pig or Minnie 
Mouse and she sort of looks at it as though to say ‘there’s not a hope 
in hell I’m wearing that’ and it’s put to the side.

'I always buy them decent shoes. I like them to have Hunters and Uggs and Russell and Bromley wellies so we spend quite a bit.

Faye says she finds it impossible not to spoil the girls and says she gets as much enjoyment from their wardrobe as her own

Faye admits: 'Scarlet's turned into a total snob already. She sort of looks at some clothes and won''t even dare pick them up'

The family home is filled with expensive and luxury toys for the girls, who also enjoy regular 5 star holidays

Parents spend £3,000 on toys in the year, with an additional £2,000 on Christmas and birthdays

'It’s important that they walk properly so I wouldn’t ever buy any sort of cheap shoes from Next or M&S or anything like that.'

Scarlett developed her penchant for fine things at an early age.

'She only slept in Merino Kids when she was a baby,' said Faye.

'When it’s your first you think something awful is going to happen to them if they don’t have the best of everything.

'Her coming home from the hospital outfit was a little Ralph Lauren babygro.

'I never had her in it again because we didn’t find out the baby’s sex and the babygro was blue.

'That cost £65 I think.'

And Scarlett’s expensive tastes aren’t limited to fashion, extending to cars, holidays and even home decor.

'My husband drives a Porsche Cayman and Scarlett particularly likes being in the front seat of that,' said Faye.

'She thinks that my 4x4 Volkswagon is really boring in comparison.

'I think she’ll probably be into really fast cars.'

Faye and her husband, Paul Jacobs, 35, a business development manager, live in a large four bedroom detached house in Camberley, Surrey.

The couple spent £6,500 on decorating Scarlett’s nursery and first bedroom, opting for designer furniture from exclusive brand, ASPACE.

The bed alone cost £1,000.

And when it comes to holidays, no expense is spared.

Faye said: 'They are a bit spoilt with holidays.

'In Scarlett’s first year she went to Cape Town, Mykonos in Greece, Dubai and Spain and since we’ve had Savannah we’ve been to Dubai again, France and Halkidiki in Greece.

'It’s really impressive but my husband doesn’t care how much a holiday costs.

'We always make sure it’s totally five star with Michelin star restaurants in the hotel.

'The holidays are world class and we’ve spent about £25,000.

Faye describes Scarlett as a 'shoe girl' since 18-months-old, whereas Savannah is more fascinated by her mother’s Mulberry messenger bag.

At age one, little Savannah has travelled more than some adults, having been to Dubai, France and Halkidiki in Greece

'You have children and if you’ve got the money why wouldn’t you give them the best of everything?' Faye explains

Faye said: 'We bought her a pair of Cinderella shoes from the Disney shop and Scarlett absolutely hated them because they weren’t high enough and they weren’t expensive enough and they weren’t like proper shoes so she wasn’t interested.

'She likes to stomp around the house in stonking great stilettos and I’m always catching her in my Kurt Geiger heels.

'We take a photo because it looks really cute then we go mad.

'I’m really impressed at how she walks in them because I can’t walk that well in heels!'

Faye says she wants her girls to have the best of everything - whatever the cost - and loves dolling up her daughters.

She said: 'I always knew friends that were spoilt and I remember thinking when I have children I really don’t want that, I want them to be able to appreciate everything.

'But then you have children and if you’ve got the money why wouldn’t you give them the best of everything?

'I suppose they are spoilt but they’re not as spoilt as some children and I think if you can afford it then you can’t really justify not getting them the best.

'What they wear gives me as much pleasure in my own wardrobe and it’s hard not to splash out when they wear it so well.'
