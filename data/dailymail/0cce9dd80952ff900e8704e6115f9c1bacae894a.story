A California State University, Northridge (CSUN) fraternity will be suspended for approximately three-and-a-half years.

Jeff Noblitt, a representative for CSUN, told the Los Angeles Times that Tau Kappa Epsilon is not a recognized fraternity anymore. The chapter's Greek duties were relieved, Noblitt also said.

'CSUN has a zero-tolerance policy for hazing,' Noblitt told the newspaper.

Tau Kappa Epsilon is the third fraternity suspended by the university.

Tau Kappa Epsilon will be suspended from January 21, 2015 through July 20, 2018, according to the Los Angeles Times. 

CSUN was looking into a fall 2013 retreat at which hazing and sexual misconduct allegedly took place, the newspaper reported.

Noblitt told the newspaper someone requested a fraternity pledge snap a woman's chest, which had the TKE letters on it. The student refused and told authorities what happened, Noblitt said.

CSUN had already prohibited on-campus pledging, the Los Angeles Times noted.

19-year-old Armando Villa died in 2014 and suffered dehydration on a July Pi Kappa Phi hike, according to the newspaper, which said that the fraternity is no longer operating. 

Pi Kappa Alpha's Zeta Omicron chapter was received a six-year-ban from CSUN in October 2014, according to the Los Angeles Times.

A spokesman for Tau Kappa Epsilon's international headquarters declined to comment.

On Monday, Noblitt told Daily Mail Online in an emailed statement 'Hazing is prohibited at CSUN and any organization failing to comply with university policies are subject to a variety of punishments or sanctions. Individuals who participate in acts of hazing are personally accountable under the CSUN hazing policy, regardless of the outcome of any related case brought against a student group or organization.'

Noblitt also said that 'CSUN has a zero-tolerance policy regarding hazing — every complaint is investigated and disciplinary action is taken for any violations.'

He added 'We have made it abundantly clear how seriously we take these issues. This has resulted in CSUN suspending three organizations, including one permanently. CSUN President Dianne F. Harrison and Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Dr. William Watkins are leading a cultural shift here at CSUN. Taking the unprecedented step to halt all pledging or new member intake clearly shows that CSUN is backing its words with actions. We are working collaboratively with our students, our alumni, and our faculty and staff advisors to create the landscape where these organizations can operate and meet the expectations of CSUN and their own parent organizations.'
