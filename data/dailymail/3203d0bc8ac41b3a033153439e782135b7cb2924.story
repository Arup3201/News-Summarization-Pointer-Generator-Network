‘Fans don’t like him – they love him,' said Brandon Steiner, CEO of Steiner Sports. 

'It’s an easy gift to give this year, so our sales are up. The interest level is probably twice as much as it normally is.' 

Jeter, 40, retired from the Major Leagues at the end of September. To honor his remarkable 20-year career, the Empire State Building was lit up with pinstripes to mimic the Yankees jersey. 

Jeter won 5 World Series Titles, a Rookie of the Year Award, an All-Star MVP, a World Series MVP, was named to 14 All-Star teams, leads the Yankees in numerous all-time categories, and collected well over 3000 hits.
