A summer she will never forget for all sorts of reasons could take another remarkable turn for Caroline Wozniacki with a serious run at the US Open title.

Just as her high profile split from the Northern Irishman has ignited his golf the same could be said – albeit on a slightly lower plane – for her tennis, and last night she scored one of the best wins of her career. 

In steaming humidity on the Arthur Ashe Stadium she overcame fifth seed Maria Sharapova 6-4 2-6 6-2 to score a hugely popular victory that puts her through to the last eight.

Victory: Caroline Wozniacki can hardly believe it as she beats Maria Sharapova 

Determination: Wozniacki puts everything into a backhand shot 

Not her day: Sharapova gave her all but it was not her day at Flushing Meadows 

As one of only four surviving top ten players in the women’s draw there is every opportunity to reach the final, and now she will play the number 13 Sara Errani of Italy.

Wozniacki is training to run the New York Marathon in November, and her increased levels of stamina helped in the hostile conditions as she warded off one of Sharapova’s trademark fightbacks with some scintillating tennis.

She also had to contend with the Russian’s usual stalling tactics and early in the third set implored umpire Marija Cicak to try and speed up the pace of play from the other end. Sharapova had already been given a code violation for taking too long in the permitted ten-minute break after two sets which the women are allowed in searing heat.

Wozniacki, a former world number one, went into a slump during her relationship with McIlroy as trying to keep it going across the world took its toll on the pair of them, and this is her first Grand Slam quarter final since January 2012 in Australia.

After he dumped her by phone in May when the wedding invitations had gone out she regrouped and has played steadily better since, actually winning an event in Istanbul the day he claimed the British Open.

Wozniacki afterwards brushed off questions about whether the split from McIlroy had re-energised her saying: 'I don’t think that’s really relevant here.'

She was more open about her marathon training, explaining that she was told this highly unusual form of preparation for a tennis player should not be over-damaging on her joints: 'To be honest, tennis is tough on your body. 

'I think all of us wake up every morning and something is hurting. You know, we play on hard courts so much and it takes a beating. But at the same time, I have done a lot of running. I do a lot of running in my training anyway. 

'So I think my team looked and said, Look, she's so excited about this. She's doing it for charity. She's so pumped about it. So they just said, Go for it. You only live once. You know, tick off as many things on your bucket list as possible. They're happy for me.'

She denied questioning her ability to return to the top of the game after a prolonged dip, adding: 'I never doubt myself. I work hard every day. I know I have the levels to compete against anybody, and I can beat anyone on a good day. But as I said, the women's game is really evolving and it gets tougher and tougher.

'The season for me has been a little bit up and down, and it's so nice to kind of start feeling like I'm playing the way I want to. You know, this hard court season has been amazing for me. 

'I actually started already feeling really good on court since Eastbourne. I have just been building on my game since then. 

'Today I just kept thinking to myself, Just stay in there. Try and take the initiative. It was really hard.

'The wind was blowing a lot from one side of the court. So you kind of had to adapt a lot.'
