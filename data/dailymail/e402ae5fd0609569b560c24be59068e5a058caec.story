A newly married couple claim one of their wedding guests stole their cake and gave it to her policeman boyfriend to share with colleagues at work.

Bride and groom Andrew and Claire Phillips, from Great Barr, Birmingham,  say their memories of the day were ruined after an old school friend took her wedding cake.

Mother of two Mrs Phillips said the friend took the uneaten 75-cupcake arrangement home at the end of the wedding and then got angry when the newlyweds asked for them back.

Shocking: A joyful Andrew and Claire Phillips cut their £175 wedding 
cake - blissfully unaware that an old schoolfriend would take it home 
and give it to her boyfriend

Happy couple: Mrs Phillips said she was 'angry and upset' by the cake's disappearance which had ruined her memories of her big day

The friend said her policeman boyfriend had taken most of the cakes to his station, and suggested the bride 'prioritise what's really important'.

The new bride complained to West Midlands Police claiming the cakes had been stolen, but was told no crime had been committed.

Childminder Mrs Phillips, 30, married Mr Phillips on October 26 at Holt Castle before their dream reception in nearby Worcester.

She had been delighted to invite the old friend, who had got back in touch on Facebook after 14 years - but was horrified at her eventual appalling behaviour.

At the end of the night, the friend offered to help box up the uneaten cupcakes, paid for by Mrs Phillips’ new sister-in-law, to be handed to guests later.

'We got so caught up in the excitement of the day that we forgot to hand out the cakes to guests,' said Mrs Phillips.   

'Happy honeymoon': Left, the aggressive text messages from the friend after Mrs Phillips asked where her £175 wedding cake, right, had gone

'We left at about midnight and the woman who took the cakes started to box them up with a bridesmaid, who told her everything should be left in the room until the next day.

'She insisted that she would take them with her, and my bridesmaid assumed that she would drop them back to us the next day.

'I couldn’t believe it when she would not answer our calls the next day. I was so angry that I went round to her house and stood knocking at the door. She did not answer but did eventually leave 25 of them in a black bag on her doorstep.

'I tried to get the other 50 back but received a text message as we were leaving for the airport for our honeymoon, which said her partner had them with him at the police station. We assume they were just handed out.

'My sister-in-law spent £175 on the cakes and is gobsmacked that someone would do this.'

In text message exchanges between Claire and her ex-friend, the woman said: 'Falling out over some f****** cakes. Wish I hadn’t bothered coming. Happy honeymoon.

'Gobsmacked': The woman eventually left 25 cupcakes in a black bag on her doorstep, the 30-year-old bride revealed

'You really should prioritise what’s important. This is not worth the stress you’re making for yourself.'

But Mrs Phillips said: 'We are just really angry and upset about the whole thing. This was no ordinary cake, it is really important to us.

'We made a statement with police in Kingstanding, Birmingham. We were given a crime reference number but received a call to say that it would be very hard to prove deception.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'This incident was reported to us on November 6. Advice was given that it was a civil matter.'

The force did not comment on claims that the cakes were handed out to West Midlands police officers.
