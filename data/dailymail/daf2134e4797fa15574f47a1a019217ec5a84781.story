The world's thinnest watch - just 0.8mm thick - has been designed using a single piece of bendy stainless steel.

The CST-01 watch is thinner than a credit card and shows the time on an electronic ink display. This E ink design uses the same technology as the screen on the Kindle e-reader.

It has a 0.5mm flexible electronic component built-in and a Thinergy Micro-Energy Cell battery that can be charged in 10 minutes and has a lifetime of 15 years.

The CST-01 watch, made by the Chicago-based firm Central Standard Timing. It is 0.8mm thick - thinner than a credit card - and shows the time on an electronic ink display. It is made from a single piece of bendy stainless steel and is fitted with a flexible electronic circuit

There are four models of the CST-01 in black and white, pictured, rose gold and black with black coated stainless steel. Each comes in small, medium or large. It uses a Thinergy Micro-Energy Cell battery that can be charged in 10 minutes and and has a lifetime of 15 years

A 'smart watch' which pairs with 
smartphones to display messages on screen became an internet 
phenomenon - raising $4,319,959 in just five days last year.

The Pebble E Ink watch was launched via 
the KickStarter 'crowdfunding' website - and aimed to raise just 
$100,000 in funding for the techno-timepiece.

The watch has a screen similar
to the E Ink screens of devices such as Amazon's Kindle.

The 'smart watch' will pair with iPhone 
and Android handsets to display messages such as texts or data from 
fitness apps on screen.

This micro energy cell can be recharged 10,000 times.

This battery's charge then lasts for a month before needing to be recharged.

The CST-01 is powered by an energy-efficient Seiko Epson System on a Chip (SoC).

To make the watch ultra-thin it doesn't have any knobs or buttons.

The CST watch is made by the Chicago-based firm Central Standard Timing, and is the brainchild of Dave Vondle. 

This image shows all the components that go into the CST-01 flexible wristwatch. A single piece of bendy stainless steel is fitted with a flexible electronic circuit, a micro energy cell and a Seiko Epson System on a Chip. It is then fitted with an E ink display

He founded Central Standard Timing with colleague Jerry O'Leary. Both are interaction designers and electrical engineers at global design firm IDEO Labs in Illinois and used the labs to thoroughly test the design's flexibility.

Vondle came up for the idea for the CST-01 after taping an E Ink panel around his wrist.

He then said to O'Leary: 'I want to make a watch like this.' 

'All aspects of design and engineering were carefully considered for the
CST-01’s unique functional and aesthetic benefits, said Vondle.

'The CST-01 is the most minimal expression of a timepiece.

'It’s ‘time’ embedded in a band,' added co-founder and fellow IDEO Labs colleague Jerry O'Leary.

The basic black and white CST-01, pictured, costs £69 ($109). The CST-01NR has a black front and a black coated stainless steel band and the CST-01RG has a black front and a rose gold coated stainless steel band. These two models cost £76 ($119)

The project was launched via a Kickstarter campaign in February this year after Vondle and O'Leary showed off the device at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

More than $1 million (£655,000) was raised and the first shipments to Kickstarter backers are expected to be sent in September.

Other customers can pre-order the watch from Central Standard Timing's website and these are expected to be shipped by December.

The CST-01 comes in four models and each one comes in three wrist sizes - small, medium and large.

The black CST-01BL and the white CST-01WH both come with an uncoated stainless steel band and costs £69 ($109). 

To charge the built-in micro cell battery of the CST-01, as well as change the time from 12-hour to 24-hour format, owners must buy a separate base station, pictured. This costs £22 ($35) and can be plugged into a standard USB port. To plug it into the wall a Universal Wall Adapter must be bought for £10 ($15)

The CST-01NR has a black front and a black coated stainless steel band and the CST-01RG has a black front and a rose gold coated stainless steel band.

These two models cost £76 ($119).

To charge all models and switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, customers also need to buy a base station for £22 ($35).

The unit is powered with an included micro-USB cable that can be plugged into any standard USB port.

To plug the station into a wall plug, customers can buy the Universal Wall Adapter for £10 ($15).
