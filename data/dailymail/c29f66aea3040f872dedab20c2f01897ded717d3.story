A mother of three got an an unexpected surprise while taking a shower Wednesday morning.

Brittany Young of Des Moines, Iowa was having intense pain that day, so she decided to lay down until it subsided, but when it struck again, she decided to jump in the shower.

That is when, just five minutes later, she suddenly gave birth to a healthy baby girl.

She named the child Miracle.

The Des Moines Register reports that while Young did know she was pregnant, she did not know just how far along she was with her new baby, thinking she was only 12 weeks along at the time.

As for the speedy labor, that is likely due to the fact that Young has had three other labors in just the past few years.

'I've been in shock for the last couple of days, because I didn't expect a full-term baby,' Young said. 

'With my other kids, I had like three or four pushes. And with her it was just one and she was there.'

Little Miracle meanwhile could not have done better in the situation.

'This baby's eyes were open; she was just sitting there staring at me. She didn't cry or anything,' Young said. 

'I was in shock. I was like, there's a baby here.'

A friend called an ambulance, and Miracle was treated and released back to her mother.

Young, who has three other children (L to R: Nijaya, Andre and Jahanna) thought she was just 12 weeks pregnant

Now however, Young has to deal with providing for a new child she thought she had months to get ready for.

'I don't have clothes. Diapers. Nothing,' said Young.

Bethany Christian Services Stronger Beginnings is assisting Young with diapers and other items to care for a newborn, and anyone willing to donate may contact the program at  515-270-0824.

As for Miracle's new siblings, Andre, 4, Nijaya, 2, and Jahanna, 1, Young says they could not be more exited about their new baby sister.

And the same goes for mom.

'I'm happy that she's here,' said Young.
