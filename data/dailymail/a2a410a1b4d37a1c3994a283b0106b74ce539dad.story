Finding grubs in your dinner won't be cause for complaint in a new Welsh restaurant. 

Chef Adam Holcroft's Grub Kitchen is set to open in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, this summer and it will serve dishes which feature  crickets, bugs and worms.

The 37-year-old head chef says it will be the first restaurant in the UK dedicated to serving insects as protein to show how bugs can help feed the booming global population.

Mr Holcroft said the restaurant aims to 'normalise' eating creepy crawlies on a daily basis.

He said: 'We're treating them as a normal food item, incorporating insect protein as an ingredient but using normal flavours we're familiar with and everyday food items we recognise.

'We want to pioneer the movement to normalise the eating of bugs on a day-to-day basis.'

Mr Holcroft and his team have found some interesting ways of incorporating insects into their cooking.

The restaurant menu will include bug burritos and burgers, bamboo fudge worm ice cream and cricket kofta kebabs.

Some of the bugs used in recipes include sago worms, meal worms, crickets and grubs 

He said: 'As a chef you are always looking for ways to be creative.

'We've found that we can ground crickets up to make flour, which can be used in baking. We've also created cricket grapes served with bamboo worm fudge ice cream.'

Mr Holcroft set up shop after a run of successful pop-up cafes serving grubs to intrigued diners across South Wales last year.

He said that the new dishes and food creations come off the back of years of research into the principles of entomophagy - the practice of eating insects.

Entomophagy remains common in some parts of the world with at least two billion people worldwide eat insects, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation at the UN.

Yellow jacket wasp larvae are popular in Japan, cicadas are treasured in Malawi, and weaver ants are devoured in Thailand.

Termites, a food favourite in many African nations, can be fried, smoked, steamed, sun-dried or ground into a powder. The list of edible insect species is currently at 1,900 and growing.

But he is keen not to put off squeamish customers - so if you don't fancy a bug-based dish you will be able to order something a bit more traditional.

Adam said: 'I'm a firm believer that people aren't going to stop eating meat - that goes against biology - so bugs are also going to sit next to normal dishes on the menu.

'For example, we're serving both bug burgers and lamb kebabs.'

Grub Kitchen will be based at Dr Beynon's Bug Farm - a science attraction run by Oxford University entomologist and television presenter Dr Sarah Beynon. 

Unconvinced? Consider British wine merchants Laithwaite's world's first insect and wine matching guide, created last year, which paired Chardonnay with tarantulas, sparkling rose to barbecued locusts, sherry to giant waterbugs and Shiraz with sago worms.

 

Asian Forest Scorpion - Scorpions have a strong, bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce. Paris Street Rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied Transylvanian Pinot Noir, so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of flavours.

Mealworms - Match their nutty taste and light, crunchy texture with a crisp Clare Valley Viognier wine that has just the right combination of fruit and richness.

Zebra Tarantula - Tarantulas are normally eaten deep fried, so think similar to fish and chips. A lively full bodied Chardonnay will stand up to the complex fishy flavours of the tarantula.

Sago Worms - These worms have a distinct taste a bit similar to bacon so you need a big meaty red with loads of punch to match that savoury flavour. McLaren Vale Shiraz is fresh with loads of red fruit and spice

BBQ Locusts - Locusts taste a bit like an exotic bar snack and with the BBQ flavour you'll need a wine with a hint of sweetness. The Hacienda de Lluna Moscatel is a gorgeous lightly bubbly pink that works well as an aperitif.

Chocolate dipped locusts - These locusts are essentially a savory dish as they taste a bit like sunflower seeds, but also have the sweetness from the chocolate. A rich robust wine with loads of sweet fruit will stand up to these flavours. 

Giant Waterbugs - The meat inside the water bug's body tastes a bit similar to a sweet scallop, while the head has hints of anise, so you'll need to find a wine that can match well with seafood and stronger flavours. A dry sherry, and a Fino at that, is the only choice here. The crisp citrus and nutty flavours will complement their complex flavours.

Queen Weaver Ants - Their slightly sour and crunchy tastes like a lemon. They would go well with an aromatic white with pretty fruit and floral notes. A Gewürztraminer provides the perfect balance to crunchy textures.

Asian Forest Scorpion - Scorpions have a strong, bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce. Paris Street Rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied Transylvanian Pinot Noir, so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of sweet and sour.

Crickets - The flavours are much harder to distinguish in crickets and so they are often prepared with garlic and salt. Nevertheless the nutty flavor that comes through means a perfect fit is a rich full-bodied white wine like Albariño.

Garlic Chapulines - Have an earthy and grassy flavour and a very crunchy texture, therefore we recommend a creamy dry Champagne that will match well with the earthy flavours (similar to matching with mushrooms) and crunch.
