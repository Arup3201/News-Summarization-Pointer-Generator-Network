Brits only enjoy eight 'real' days of annual leave each year - because the rest of the time is taken up with domestic chores, a study revealed today.

Despite having an average allowance of around 24 days a year, researchers have found that the majority of that time is spent catching up on household chores, DIY projects or even doing the weekly food shop.

Looking after ill children, attending funerals and even going to medical appointments are also things which eat into Brit's annual leave.

And now our lack of holidays - which sees just eight days a year out of our annual leave spent relaxing - has been dubbed 'Vacationitis'.

Nearly two thirds claim they are more tired and stressed after a day off because they do anything but relax.

The results emerged in a study commissioned by Hilton Hotels & Resorts.

Commenting on the findings, psychologist Dr. Linda Papadopoulos said: 'We are working longer hours with over a third of us spending more time with our boss than with our partners or friends.

'In fact we're still connected to the office even when we've taken annual leave, which means we aren't even getting a break on weekends because were often working.

'These work pressures mean we don't have much down time - and not taking the time to unwind and spend time with friends and family can negatively impact our work- life balance and general well-being.

'In the same way we take responsibility for doing our job well, we also need to take responsibility for our self-care skills, and this involves putting up appropriate boundaries between work and home and also making a concerted effort to take time off, not just to catch up on domestic admin but to genuinely unwind and reconnect with friends and family.

With 40 per cent of respondents in the survey noting that vacations are the only real time they get to spend quality time with their families, its important that people are encouraged to use more than the eight out of 24 days annual leave they are currently using and gain a better work-life balance.'

The study of 2,000 workers found that each year, they are entitled to take 24 days off work, but just nine days of that is actually spent away on holiday or short breaks.

And of that, workers feel that they only relax for just eight days of it due to the travelling.

Instead, 40 per cent use some of their time off to catch up on home improvements and DIY while almost a third even take at least one day off each year to shop for birthday or Christmas presents.

Around 31 per cent use annual leave to go to medical appointments

Around 32 per cent use part of their annual leave allowance to visit friends or relatives, 31 per cent have to go to medical appointments and 28 per cent even take time off simply to catch up on household chores.

A quarter of people take days off to attend funerals or weddings with another 24 per cent using annual leave to look after children who are too ill to attend school or nursery.

One in five make use of holiday allowance to go to their children's school events like sports days and Christmas plays while 15 per cent have even had to take time off because their partner was too ill to look after their children.

Researchers also revealed that even when Brits do take time out, over half continue to check emails and take calls from the office, with five million people checking emails hourly.

Forty per cent of Brits check their work
email during social occasions such as their children's music or dance 
performances, at weddings, whilst on a date and even in bed after sex.

And among those who have office jobs, two thirds of the UK's workforce find themselves having to work at weekends, despite 85 per cent believing that small breaks help them to be more productive at work.

A quarter of respondents have even cancelled annual leave due to work pressures while over half of British workers feel unable to take all of their annual leave because they're either too busy at work, feel guilty or are paranoid due to economic uncertainty.

Andrew Flack, vice president, global brand marketing for Hilton Hotels and Resorts, which commissioned the research said: 'Vacationitis appears to be wide-spread, but has definitely hit full-time workers the hardest as they struggle to take time out for some uninterrupted holiday time.

'The traditional two week holiday continues to morph into shorter breaks in the UK, as almost half of the working population take anywhere between four and ten days for their holiday.'

The research was commissioned by Hilton Hotels & Resorts to launch its Hilton Urgent Vacation Care Centre, www.vacationcarecentre.hilton.com, where stressed out workers can find out more about Vacationitis.
