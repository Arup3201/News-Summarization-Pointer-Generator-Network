A cyclist who lost six of her front teeth in a near-fatal bike accident is today smiling again after a dentist fitted implants when the NHS refused to fund the operation.

Alex Kerr was hit by a car as she cycled home from work last November.

The 20 year-old advertising assistant was in a coma for a week and woke to find that six of her front teeth had been knocked out.

She also suffered a broken pelvis, broken jaw, two dislocated knees and a broken wrist.

While Ms Kerr made a full recovery, she left hospital looking dramatically different.

Despite missing her teeth the NHS told Ms Kerr a new set of teeth was not regarded as ‘acute care’.

She was told that she would be put on a waiting list unless she paid £12,000 for a private procedure.

But Ms Kerr said her broken teeth left her too self-conscious to leave her home in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.

After reading about her plight dentist Dr Wynand de Jeger of the Brooklands Dental Practice in nearby Broughton, stepped in, offering to fit her new implants free of charge.

‘I was just so self-conscious all the time and sometimes didn't want to leave the house. I can't even imagine what it would be like if I couldn't have these implants done,’ Ms Kerr said.

‘Me and my boyfriend had just moved into a new flat when I had my accident and now I can finally begin to enjoy it.

‘My family just can't believe how confident I am again. My smile is nothing like it was after the accident. I'm really happy.

‘I
 am so grateful to everyone at Brooklands especially my dentist. He was 
the one who contacted me and he has been there all the way through my 
recovery.’

left hospital looking dramatically different with her teeth still 
missing (pictured above), after the NHS told her that a new set of teeth was not regarded
 as ‘acute care’. She says she was told that she would be put on a waiting list unless she paid £12,000 for a private procedure and was too self-conscious to leave her house

During the operation in May, Dr de Jeger fixed three screws through Ms Kerr’s gums and into her jaw.

Three implants were then screwed into place before a further three teeth were inserted using a bridge.

It will be another month before permanent porcelain implants are screwed in place.

Brooklands Dental Practice performed the operation for free and the company that manufacture the teeth waived the cost of the materials needed.

Ms Kerr said: 'My family just can't believe how confident I am again. My smile is nothing like it was after the accident'

‘It was really painful after the operation but a week later it was just normal, as if nothing had ever happened,’ Ms Kerr said.

‘It is just so nice to know that there are people out there with such a kind heart.’

Ms Kerr said that she had been led to believe that her treatment would be carried out for free when she was transferred to hospital two weeks after her accident.

But when she went for a follow-up appointment with a maxillofacial expert she was told she would have to foot the bill for any future treatment herself.

Permanent implants cost around £2,000-per-tooth and Ms Kerr was worried and angry that she could not afford to fix her appearance.

‘I read in magazines all the time about people who have boob jobs, nose jobs and other cosmetic surgery on the NHS because their confidence needing boosting,’ she said.

‘I didn't mean this to happen and I didn't just go to the doctor and say I had a lack of self-confidence and so needed some teeth.

'I had been in an accident and you would think it would be a priority for them to help me.’

Dr de Jeger, a dental surgeon who has worked on TV show Celebrity Extreme Makeover, said he was compelled to help Ms Kerr after hearing about her story.

He said: ‘Brooklands is very pleased with the results of Alex's treatment so far.

‘We are currently managing the recovery of the soft tissue to ensure the final restoration will be aesthetically pleasing.’
