Sky diving is not for the faint of heart and neither is this footage of a student skydiver who almost falls to his death during a sky diving lesson gone very, very wrong.

Yahoo Canada reports that a student skydiver named Eugene S. ended up in a dangerous position mid-air and his instructors frantically managed to re-position him to safety.

'During an accelerated free fall level 3 lesson, this student skydiver named Eugene S. experienced an incredibly tense moment after ending up on his backside.

Luckily one of his quick thinking instructions managed to stabilize his spinning motion after getting into a safe position,' says Yahoo Canada's description of the video.

Before the fall: Eugene is pictured on board an airplane before making a scary dive that almost sends him spiraling to his death 

Hold him steady: The instructors begin by stabilizing the skydiver by holding him on both side to make sure he falls with an even distribution of body weight 

Free falling: At first Eugene seems to be sailing smoothly, that is until he spirals out of control and almost falls to his death because he's unable to release his parachute

The video shows two instructors and one student jump out of an airplane.

The instructors are seen holding the student in the air by either side to make sure that he doesn't spiral out of control.

Unfortunately for the student, gravity is a force to be reckoned with and despite being thrown into the correct position, what goes up sometimes goes upside down.

The instructors weave from side to side do their best to get below the student who is spinning repeatedly.

One instructor finally manages to grab onto the student, stop him from spinning, and help him release his parachute.

All three sky divers land safely from a flight they'll never, ever forget.

Reverse is the curse: Eugene spins and begins falling on his back, a position from which he cannot release his parachute to ensure a safe landing 

Heroic endeavor: From far away, the instructor can be seen bringing Eugene to safe position for falling so that he may release his parachute and land safely

Safe landing: Both instructors and Eugene manage to release their parachutes and fall safely in the correct face-down position towards the ground
