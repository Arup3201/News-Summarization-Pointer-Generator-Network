Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson has laid into Mario Balotelli after the Liverpool striker's latest faltering performance in the goalless draw with Blackburn in Sunday's FA Cup quarter final.

The misfiring Italy international, who has managed only four goals in all competitions since his £16million summer arrival from AC Milan, was brought on after 59 minutes but failed to impress as the game ended 0-0 to force a replay at Ewood Park.

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Lawrenson let fly with a scathing attack on the former Manchester City star who he labelled 'a waste of space'.

'Forget about Mario Balotelli. He is an absolute waste of time. He shouldn't be anywhere near this team,' he said.

'I can see why Brendan Rodgers threw him on today as he might just create something, but 99 times out of 100 he will let you down.'

Match Zone statistics  from the game show that Balotelli managed only a single shot on target after coming on as a substitute and appear to support Lawrenson's claims.

Balotelli's performance comes just days after he posted a cryptic Instagram message suggesting that one of his team-mates did not like him.

Although, having angered players by taking a penalty away from Jordan Henderson during a Europa League clash with Besiktas and with statistics that include only creating six chances for his team-mates all season, it's hardly surprising that the 24-year-old's popularity is waning.

Lawrenson praised Blackburn for their tactically astute performance to earn a replay at Ewood Park, which has now been scheduled for April 7 or 8th to meet UEFA regulations.

'Congratulations to Blackburn Rovers on an absolutely magnificent display. They were never ever desperate at any time,' he said.

'They have looked at how Liverpool have played recently and the tactics were spot on. Goalkeeper Simon Eastwood hasn't really had to make a real top class save.'

Rodgers admitted that he would rather wait a month for the replay than have to play 48 hours later as has happened to Bradford and Reading after their goalless draw on Saturday.

‘I believe the replay is early April, the 7th or 8th,’ said Rodgers. 

‘It is certainly not what it is for Reading and Bradford. That is unbelievable. I feel for them, having to play Saturday and again on Monday. It is incredible. It’s unfair for both clubs with so much at stake. I feel sorry for Parky and for Steve and for the players.’

The game at Anfield was marred by a head injury to defender Martin Skrtel who required eight minutes of treatment after losing consciousness from landing awkwardly. He was eventually taken off on a stretcher, having played only a few minutes.
