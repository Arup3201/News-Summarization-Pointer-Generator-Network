The relationship between Google co-founder Sergey Brin and the company's marketing manager Amanda Rosenberg may have broken the Internet giant's company code.

Miss Rosenberg, who is credited with coming up with the 'OK, Glass' command for Google Glass was named as the new 
lover of Brin, 40, yesterday.

Google has been rocked by talk of the 
romance, and a spokesman yesterday confirmed that Brin – one of the 
world’s richest men with a $23 billion fortune – has for several months 
been living apart from his wife of six years, and mother of his two children, Anne Wojcicki.

It is not known how long Miss Rosenberg, who was educated at the $48,000-a-year Marlborough College, the same school as the Middletons, has been dating Brin.

An unnamed source told the New York Post Brin and his wife were 'still together when Amanda entered the picture'.

It is possible the relationship violated Google's company code.

Google gossip: Amanda Rosenberg is the 
27-year-old British woman who has struck up a romance with billionaire Google co-founder Sergey Brin

An online version of the code states: 'Romantic relationships between 
co-workers can, depending on the work roles and respective positions of 
the co-workers involved, create an actual or apparent conflict of 
interest'.

It added: 'If
 a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict, it 
may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of 
employment of either or both individuals involved.'

Google goes on to offer a self-test to help employees decide if their relationship could cause a problem. 

'When faced with a potential conflict of 
interest, ask yourself: would this activity harm my reputation, 
negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm 
Google?

'Would this activity embarrass Google or me 
if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or a blog?  If 
the answer to any of these questions is "yes", the relationship or 
situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should 
avoid it.'

Brin is not the first Google executive Miss Rosenberg has been linked to since she transferred to the San Francisco offices last year.

She was linked to Hugo Barra, who resigned this week to take a job with Android phone maker Xiaomi in China.

His departure comes after 'a recent thorny personal situation related to the end of a romantic relationship he had with another Googler,' the New York Post reported.

'Relationships between senior executives and more-junior employees raise myriad concerns,' James McRitchie, publisher of Corporate Governance, said.

'Dating a subordinate is generally a bad idea, from the company's perspective,' he told Yahoo Finance, adding that it had the potential to damage morale or violate confidentiality.

Should Brin and his wife divorce, Californian law suggests their 
massive fortune would have to be halved – although they reportedly 
signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement.

While the internet was agog 
with talk of Brin romancing his much younger employee, the Daily Mail 
tracked down a distinctly unsurprised former boyfriend of Miss Rosenberg
 – who said she ‘knew the power of her womanly ways’.

Ewan Butler, 
28, a trainee teacher living with his parents in Darlington, said: 
‘Amanda’s a good looking girl, and she knows she is.'

'And she’s good at 
“playing” men – she played me.’

Brin’s relationship with Miss Rosenberg 
emerged only yesterday – but the pair were pictured together earlier 
this year at a New York Fashion Week event, both wearing the 
controversial Google Glass computerised spectacles for which she is 
marketing manager.

An employee of Google since she graduated with a 
communications degree from Leeds University, she initially worked for 
the internet giant in London before last year moving to San Francisco to
 work at its Silicon Valley nerve centre.

She soon won a role 
promoting Google Glass, widely criticised as the glasses which enable 
users to film and broadcast over the internet everything they see 
non-stop, worrying privacy campaigners.

Miss Rosenberg wrote an 
online blog soon after she arrived – describing herself as a 
‘misanthropic Brit struggling to come to terms with Californian 
optimism’.

She wrote: ‘I’d been living a beautifully choreographed 
life in London for pretty much my entire life; family, friends, job, 
life. Then one day I realised the beauty had faded.

‘So I applied for a transfer with my company to a different country. Yes! The romance of a transfer!

‘Luckily for me this all worked out like I dreamed it would...NOT. Of course it didn’t work out like that!

‘I
 remember having conversations with people about moving countries, and 
no one talks about how it felt to be alone.

'I wanted to grab them and 
scream “Why are you not telling me about how you ate lunch in the 
toilets at work for the first week because no one talked to you?”.’

Miss
 Rosenberg also wrote that she was initially so 
shy she failed to turn up at her first work drinks invitation, fearing 
she would be ‘the weird loner in the corner’, so stayed in eating 
biscuits alone on her sofa instead.

In an internet profile Miss 
Rosenberg wrote of herself: ‘I’m part of the master race that is the 
Chinese Jew or Chew, if you will.

'Born in Hong Kong but bred in the UK. A
 misanthrope who’s bad at maths, so I got the worst of both worlds.’

Last night Miss Rosenberg – who got her
 Google Glass job after coming up with the voice command ‘Ok, Glass’ to 
activate the device - could not be contacted for comment.

A spokesman
 for Brin – who founded Google with Larry Page in 1998 – said that he 
was not legally separated from his wife and that ‘they remain good 
friends and partners’.
