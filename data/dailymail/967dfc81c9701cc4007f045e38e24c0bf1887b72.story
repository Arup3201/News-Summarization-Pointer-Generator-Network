Burberry Prorsum has unveiled its pre-fall collection and it perfectly captures the romantic elegance of British craftwork.

The latest drop, curated by chief creative officer Christopher Bailey, is inspired by 19th century British arts and crafts.

The eclectic mix of jacquard, print and texture evokes a distinctively romantic mood in keeping with the luxury fashion house's ongoing theme of love.

New drop: Burberry Prorsum have unveiled a rich and romantic pre-fall 14 collection of jacquard coats and chunky knits

In a nod to the luxury label's British heritage, many of the pieces were produced using UK tie looms and the traditional horse blanket jacquard was woven in Scotland.

In the striking new campaign, Bailey has paired wool cocoon coats with cropped trousers and depicted some of the world's most iconic building - such as Shanghai’s World Financial Center and Paris’ Notre Dame cathedral - on his tops.

This season sees diamond-shaped pencil skirts made with 3D jacquard patterns.

As for accessories, there are open-toe leather boots with tapestry brocades and covetable handbags covered in shaved fox fur.

Burberry sales topped £1billion in the
past six months as the luxury clothing and goods business continued to 
draw in customers around the world - hence the witty play on maps and landmarks in this collection.

The
achievement was hailed by boss Angela Ahrendts, who announced plans 
last month to step down by mid-2014 to take up a new position with 
Apple.

Burberry shares are 
down about 6 per cent since the news Ahrendts will be succeeded by 
Christopher Bailey, who will also retain his chief creative officer 
role, with some investors arguing the two jobs would not sit easily 
together.
