Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres is facing a backlash from an Inuit community in Canada after using her famous Oscars selfie to raise money from an anti-seal hunting charity.

Members of the Inuit indigenous population have been posting 'sealfies' as part of a campaign to promote their way of life after the comedian's 'selfie' raised $1.5million for the Humane Society of the United States, which opposes killing the animals.

Filmmaker Alethea Arnaquq-Baril, from Iqaluit, Nunavut, promoted the Inuit campaign in a blog in which she encouraged people to post pictures of themselves wearing clothing made from seal fur, along with the hashtag #sealfie.

In a blog post, Ms Arnaquq-Baril describes herself as a fan of the comedian, but added: 'However, Ellen cannot know how she is hurting us if we don't let her know.'

A number of 'sealfies' have now been posted to Twitter, featuring people dressed in furs along with messages of support.

In a Facebook message sent to The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Ms Arnaquq-Baril wrote: 'Thanks for your wonderful career, it is an inspiration to many women, the LGBT community, and anyone who's had to fight for survival and fair treatment.

'We as Inuit are among them, and I hope you will take your responsibility to be informed on this issue seriously.

'The days of a free-for-all unregulated seal hunt endangering the population (which Inuit never took part in anyway) are long gone.

'Fighting against commercial seal hunting is no longer relevant in today's society, but it brings animal rights groups a lot of money, while ensuring the poorest populations in North America are even poorer.'

The Ellen DeGeneres Show's website calls the seal hunt 'one of the most atrocious and inhumane acts against animals allowed by any government.'

But Sandi Vincent, 26, of Rnakin Inlet, told canoe.ca: 'The meat feeds families, which is important to an area where many households have identified that they face issues of food insecurity.'

She also said the pelts help provide warmth and a needed source of income.

Korean firm Samsung agreed to donate $1 to a charity of DeGeneres' choice for every time her selfie was retweeted.
