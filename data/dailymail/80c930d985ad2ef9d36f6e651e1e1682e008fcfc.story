In case you missed this among the millions of words recently devoted to a certain deceased Brazilian, we ought to point out the full range of his all-encompassing brilliance.

As well as his driving prowess, Ayrton Senna designed the Sistine Chapel, ran up Everest in his bare feet, cured cancer, split the atom and wrote Shakespeare off the page.

Excuse the sarcasm, but there has been a danger that hyperbole – admittedly among some fabulous and balanced reminiscences – has attended the 20th anniversary of the great racer’s death.

Hyperbole: While tragic, Ayrton's Senna's death was not necessarily the darkest day in F1

Paying respect: Fans from around the world visit Senna's grave in Brazil on May 1

Never forget: 16 people were killed when Wolfgang von Trip's Ferrari careered off the track at Monza, 1961

One story I read described Senna’s fatal accident at Imola as Formula One’s darkest day. Are we really sure about that? We should remember the hot afternoon of September 10, 1961, when 16 people died at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

Jim Clark was trying to re-pass the Ferrari of Wolfgang von Trips on the second lap. ‘My front wheels were almost level with his back wheels as he started to brake,’ Clark recalled. ‘Suddenly he began to pull over towards me and he ran right into the side of me.

‘I honestly don’t think Taffy realised I was there. I am sure that when he passed me earlier, he had decided his was the faster car and I would be left behind.’

The collision catapulted the Ferrari into the crowd. Von Trips was slung out of the cockpit. He and 11 spectators died at the scene and four others perished later from the injuries they suffered.

In all, 49 drivers have died in a Formula One car, often at the rate of more than one a month during the Fifties and Sixties.

The fact the scale of commemoration for one man, the dazzling Senna, eclipses all the rest tells us something about a natural human inclination to fete icons, especially those who died young. It is, for example, easier to say he was mystical when he was cut off in his prime.

It also underlines the power of live TV to accentuate an event’s importance and amplify the memory. It may also reflect a modern tendency to involve ourselves publicly in emotional outpourings.

Emerson Fittipaldi, the 1972 and 1974 world champion, raises an interesting point.

‘It is my opinion that, had Ayrton walked uninjured from his Imola 1994 accident, he would have won the world championship for Williams in all three of those years – 1994, 1995 and 1996 – which would have given him a career total of six world championships to Michael’s five.

Blond ambition: Would Senna have won the 1997 World Championship instead of Jacques Villeneuve?

‘Indeed, he may even also have won the world championship for Williams in 1997, at 37, instead of Jacques Villeneuve, raising his world championship tally to seven.’

Senna’s last team principal, Frank (now Sir Frank) Williams, told a Brazilian newspaper this week that his driver would have gone on to rule his homeland.

‘I believe that he had politics among his plans and, if he had followed that path, he would have been on his way to becoming President of Brazil,’ he said.

Politics position: Sir Frank Williams believed the Brazilian had the power to become President of Brazil

Perhaps, but Senna’s manager Julian Jakobi told me that he though this highly unlikely.

‘Ayrton thought he could do far more to help Brazil from outside politics,’ he said.

A coda to this week’s pictures showing players at Corinthians, the football club Senna supported, wearing replica yellow, green and black helmets in his honour.

The debt owed to Senna by Brazil’s football fans is greater than many know. For in the early spring of the year he died, Senna acted as peacemaker between the nation’s two star strikers, Bebeto and Romario.

A head for the occasion: Corinthians players donned yellow helmets in respect for their fallen hero

At the prompting of Leonardo, Senna spoke to Bebeto and Romario and banged their heads together. From barely being able to bear the sight of each other, let alone, pass to one another, they formed a deadly strike partnership that won Brazil the 1994 World Cup.

News from Bahrain. Five people were sentenced this week to five years in jail for plotting to detonate a bomb during the 2013 grand prix.

I record this as a supporter of the moderate element among the ruling elite and one who is, therefore, unable to view all the anti-government protestors as freedom-fighters.

Having a blast: Five people were sentenced for plotting to explode a device at the Bahrain Grand Prix

Will this attempt to blow up innocent people from around the world – an enterprise which laughably included a woman using a pillow to pretend she was pregnant – lead the protestors’ apologists in the western media to admit there are terrorists among the anti-government faction?

The smaller teams – Marussia, Catherham, Force India and Sauber – want to ‘level the playing field’.

They believe this can be achieved by receiving more money from the sport’s pot and a universal cap on spending.

I have sympathy with them up to a point.

Lost cause: Bernie Ecclestone has questioned the wisdom in trying to help F1's smaller teams

But here is Ecclestone’s view, as quoted in Tom Bower’s biography No Angel. ‘I have tried to help struggling teams over the years,’ he says.

‘But it’s like somebody drowning. You throw them a lifebelt, then when they get to the shore, they say, “You idiot, you hit me on the head with the lifebelt.”’

Good luck with your ongoing discussions, boys.
