Condemned: This government alcohol awareness poster has sparked outrage after 'shifting the blame' onto rape victims if they have been drinking

A government poster has sparked outrage after 'shifting the blame' onto rape victims if they have been drinking. 

The black-and-white alcohol awareness poster features the image of a rape victim 
crying on the ground, with the slogan: 'One in three reported rapes 
happens when the victim has been drinking.'

It ran as part of the NHS and Home Office's 'Know Your Limits' campaign in 2006, but can still be seen in NHS hospitals, GP surgeries and universities.

Now, an online petition has been launched to ban the poster and has so far gained  more than 15,000 signatures in just a few days.

One of the signatories, Dr Alexis Thomas, from London, said the poster gave the 'wrong message' to people across the UK.

'Yes,
 it is good to try to reduce the amount people drink, but the poster 
implies that, had the victims of one in three reported rapes not been 
drunk, those rapes would not have happened,' she said.

'This
 is a false argument and one that shifts the blame for the rape to the 
victim, similarly to previous suggestions that women who dress 
provocatively are "asking" to be raped.'

The Change.org petition, started by Jack May from Oxford, is titled: 'NHS & Home Office: Remove all copies of this poster and stop victim blaming'.

Addressed to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Theresa May, it states: 'This is a blatant and appalling case of victim-blaming, putting the onus on the victim rather than the perpetrator.

'Two honourable intentions -- to stop people drinking, and to stop rape happening - are being completely deformed.

'It is not consistent with the NHS' own 
guidelines on "Help after rape and sexual assault" in which they say "If
 you have been sexually assaulted, remember that it wasn’t your fault. 
It doesn’t matter what you were wearing, where you were or whether you 
had been drinking. A sexual assault is always the fault of the 
perpetrator.

Outrage: An online petition has been launched to ban the poster, which was recently spotted on the wall of an NHS premises. Above, a Twitter user named Tracy said she was 'disgusted' by the government poster's slogan

'We ask the NHS and the Home Office to destroy this poster in all formats.'

Launched in 2006, the 'Know Your Limits' campaign aimed to raise public awareness of the risks associated with binge drinking among 18 to 24 year olds. 

Its controversial 'rape' poster remains available to download online and has been spotted on the walls of numerous public places.

The poster has also been widely condemned on social-networking sites - with 
many users deeming it 'disgusting' and 'inappropriate'.

Shocked: The poster has also been widely condemned on social-networking sites, with many users deeming it 'inappropriate'. Above, Sophie Wood said: 'I didn't realise rape was a potential side effect of women drinking'

Questioning the government's approach: Ross Williams wrote: 'Is it really appropriate for the Home Office to use "rape" and blame victims to show the effects of alcohol?'

One woman took to Twitter after spotting the poster at work, writing: 'NHS victim blaming, seen at occupational health today. Disgusted.'

Meanwhile, Sophie Wood tweeted: 'I didn't realise rape was a potential side effect of drinking.'

A
 Home Office spokesman said the 'Know Your Limits' campaign ran from 
2005 to 2007 and focused on alcohol statistics, not violence against 
women and girls.

He added that the government no longer uses this campaign, nor stocks any copies of the poster.

Sharon Gosling said: 'Seriously disgusted by this NHS England poster. As if there isn't enough victim blaming?'

Melanie Phillips directly addressed Mr Hunt, saying: 'This poster campaign is disgusting. How dare your Government blame the victims'
