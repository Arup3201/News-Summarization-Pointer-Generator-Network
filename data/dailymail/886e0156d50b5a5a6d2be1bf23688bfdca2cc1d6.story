Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen carded a third-round 67 to establish a three-shot lead at the ISPS HANDA Perth International.

The 24-year-old recorded six birdies, including three in his first four holes and then three in four again from the 11th, and one bogey to move on to 16 under par for the tournament.

'It's great, really exciting,' he said. 'I'm looking forward to standing on that first tee tomorrow and to get the last round going and see if I can play some good golf. Hopefully walk down on 18 and have a chance to win.

'I tried to go out there and be aggressive like I did the first two days, but I didn't have the game today, didn't feel good. I was struggling out there.

'I made some great up and downs to keep it going, great chip down the third where I hit my tee shot way right. So it was a fight all the way through, but I still had fun and I was fighting all the way. So five under is a great score today.'

Olesen's closest challenger at Lake Karrinyup Country Club was South Korea's Sihwan Kim.
