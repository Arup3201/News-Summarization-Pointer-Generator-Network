Agonizing death: Jesusa Ursonal Tatad, 41, faces 16 years to life in prison for the death of her ex-husband whom she fatally scalded with a pot of boiling water

A California woman convicted of killing her ex-husband by dousing him with a pot of boiling water faces 16 years to life in prison.

Jesusa Ursonal Tatad, 41, pleaded no contest to second-degree murder on Wednesday in a horrific attack that ended in the death of 36-year-old Ronnie Tatad of Daily City.

Prosecutors say that on the morning of November 26 of 2011, Jesusa Tatad pulled back the blankets on her ex-husband sleeping in their shared apartment before throwing a pot of boiling water on him.

She then proceeded to hit him over the head with a baseball bat, according to authorities.

The San Mateo County Times reports that Ronnie Tatad died about two weeks later of a blood infection connected to his burns.

Tatad
had accused him of seeing another woman two weeks before the attack 
after allegedly walking in on him with another woman in their apartment.

Even
though the couple divorced in 2007 Ronnie Tatad had promised to 
re-marry her and bring their two daughters, aged 9 and 14, back from the
Philippines to live with them, his ex-wife said.

Killed: Ronnie Tatad, 36, died from his injuries two weeks after he was attacked for allegedly having an affair with another woman despite promising to remarry his ex-wife

When he arrived home late the night before, Tatad went into a fit of jealousy, boiled the water and flung it on him, burning 55 percent of his body according to prosecutors.

'He came home later than he was supposed to,' defense attorney John May said. 'That's all I can say.'

He added: 'This is an acknowledgement by her that she caused the death of the only man she ever loved ... She wished she could change the past but she can't.'

Moments after fleeing his apartment Ronnie Tatad was found by an apartment maintenance man who called 911 after seeing the man half naked and hysterically hiding behind a car.

Police say the man grew even more hysterical once seeing his ex-wife follow him outside their apartment.

As part of a plea deal additional charges of torture and mayhem were dropped.

Tatad is being held without bail at the San Mateo County Jail.

She is scheduled to be sentenced on May 17.
