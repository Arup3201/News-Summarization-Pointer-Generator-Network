This unusual mixture of tattoos includes Disney characters, patterns found on Russian prison inmates and even a Louis Vuitton logo.

But what makes them even more strange is that they have been decorated onto live pigs while they are anaesthetised.

Wim Delvoye began tattooing live pigs in 1997 in the US, before doing it in China from 2004 to 2008, where animal welfare laws are more lax.

'Spoiled': Belgiam artist Wim Delvoye moved to China in 2004 and set up an art farm tattooing his creations onto living pigs

The Belgian artist claimed the pigs were spoiled - with locals in Yang Zhen, Beijing, said to have been amazed at how well they were treated.

Up to three artists applied a tattoo simultaneously while each pig was under anaesthetic, and carers regularly moisturised the pigs' skin.

But animal rights campaigners complained that the pigs were suffering unnecessarily and being abused for improper commercial profit.

The animals' skins were sold for up to £55,000 a piece, with one canvas featuring Disney characters sold to Chanel and made into two bags. 

A People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals spokesman said Mr Delvoye’s actions would have left the pigs ‘sore, scared and confused’.

He told MailOnline: ‘Talented and visionary artists do not rely on cruelty to animals to get attention.

‘Pigs, cows and chickens are emotional, thinking animals who feel pain every bit as much as we do, and they value their lives.’ 

Since these photographs were taken, Mr Delvoye, 49, has worked on other projects including marble replicas of twisted Gothic-style towers.

And he even tattooed a man’s back before selling it as art - with the collector bizarrely able to keep the person’s skin when he dies.

Last year Mr Delvoye told the Wall Street Journal: ‘Art must fascinate people and doing easy things is not a good way to seek fascination.’
