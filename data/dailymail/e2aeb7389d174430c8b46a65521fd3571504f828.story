Identified: The 'Forest Boy' who said he lived in a German wood for five years is actually Dutch and only left home five days before his 'discovery'

The English-speaking 'Forest Boy' who said he lived in a German wood for five years is actually Dutch and only left home five days before his 'discovery', it has been claimed.

German police said the man's stepmother had identified the 'boy', who had called himself 'Ray' and said he had been living rough with his father in the wilderness before wandering into Berlin in September, as being calledÂ  Robin van Helsum.

He is 20-years-old, and not 17 as he had previously stated, and went missing from his home in Hengelo, near the Germany city of Gronau, less than one week before he told his story.

Friends also said he left home because of 'personal problems' and to 'start a new life'.

Officers said Robin's family identified him from pictures released earlier this week.

A source said: 'We have spoken to his family and his friends and we have seen a photo where he has a chain with his name on which confirms who he is.

'This was a mystery for us and we are pleased that it has been solved.'

A Hengelo police spokesman added: 'We are very happy that he's been found.

'We are 100 per cent certain that we are dealing with the 20-year-old boy, who his stepmother unambiguously identified.'

And they warned that, if the incident proves to be a hoax, then Robin may face a substantial legal bill for wasting police time.

Police spokesman Michael Maass told Die Welt: 'It was a really frustrating case and took up a lot of time. That will have to be paid for and that will eventually end up at his door.'

'It's not longer a joke. If the story is made up then he deliberately took us for fools, and he could be liable for the costs.'

Police had already worked out that the boy was not a native English speaker and estimated that he was about 17.

But he had refused to allow his photo to be issued to the world which meant that officials had not been able to come further in identifying him.

According to German news agency DPA, 
Robin VH was last seen in Hengelo on September 2, 2011, ahead of taking a
 trip to Berlin with a friend.

This was just days before he appeared at the city hall as 'Forest Boy'.

More pictures have emerged of Robin since his unmasking

A school friend told Dutch broadcaster NOS: 'I am certain that is Robin. He had personal problems and that was his way of beginning a new life.'

Earlier this week, German police released the first picture of 'Forest Boy'.

They had been unable to identify him 
since he emerged in the German capital last September, and issued his 
picture in a bid to jog people's memory and maybe throw up some leads.

The 'boy' said his father called him 
'Ray' and that he was born June 20, 1994, but claimed not to know his 
last name or where he is from.

He said his mother, Doreen, died in a car accident when he was 12 and after that he and his father, Ryan, took to the forest.

They wandered using maps and a compass, staying in tents or caves overnight, he added.

And he told authorities that after his father died in August 2011, he buried him in the forest and then walked five days north before ending up in Berlin, and showed up at city hall.

Investigators had been unable to confirm any details about a fatal car accident that matched up with Ray's story, however, and weren't able to find the body of the father - raising 'serious doubts' about the story.
