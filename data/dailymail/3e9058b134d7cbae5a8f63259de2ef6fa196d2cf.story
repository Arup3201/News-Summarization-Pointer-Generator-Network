Professor Alan Thorton, who claims to be a 10th Dan Red Belt in a form of karate

Having just been awarded an MBE for services to martial arts you would think Alan Thornton would be the toast of his fellow karate experts.

But yesterday leading figures in British martial arts were instead angered and perplexed by the gong for a man they have never heard of.

The award in the Queen’s birthday honours list was given to a ‘Professor Alan Stanley Thornton’ who describes himself as a 10th Dan Red Belt in a form of karate called ‘Senai Seisshinryu Shihandokai’.

However, last night former karate champions were lining up to criticise the Honours Committee as they had heard of neither Mr Thornton nor his branch of their sport.

‘I have no idea who he is,’ said David ‘Ticky’ Donovan, who was awarded an OBE for coaching the English and British karate teams for more than 20 years. ‘If he’s a 10th Dan, then I certainly would have heard of him.’

Wayne Otto, also an OBE and the winner of five World Championship gold medals, added: ‘I can honestly say that I have never heard of him. A 10th Dan is pretty rare – there are only very few in this country and I’m pretty sure I know who they are.’

A 10th Dan is, indeed, exceptionally rare as it is the highest rank in many martial arts. Despite their legendary status in karate, not even Mr Donovan or Mr Otto have achieved it.

British martial arts organisations were last night also similarly mystified. ‘I’ve never heard of him,’ said a spokesman for the English Karate Federation.

Bob Weatherall, secretary of the British Council of Chinese Martial Arts, added: ‘I don’t know who he is.’

Investigations by the Daily Mail yesterday revealed that Mr Thornton, 53, who lives in Brentford, west London, is a man who claims to hold many distinctions.

Although he
 styles himself as a professor – and the award of the MBE uses that form
 of address – Mr Thornton last night claimed it was not an academic 
title but awarded by a Japanese martial arts organisation called 
‘Juko-kai’ – an organisation Mr Otto has not heard of.

Mr
 Thornton also claims to hold a BSc and a doctorate in ‘naturopathic 
studies’. When asked by the Mail where he had obtained these degrees, Mr
 Thornton was at first forgetful as it ‘was a long time ago’. He then 
said they were from the ‘Institute of Natural Therapy’ in India, the 
existence of which could not last night be easily verified.

On one website, it is also claimed that Mr Thornton holds the inheritable title of ¿The Most Noble the Duke of Clermont de Tornesse¿

On one website, it is also claimed that Mr Thornton holds the inheritable title of ‘The Most Noble the Duke of Clermont de Tornesse’. ‘This was given to me by a friend supposedly because of what I had done,’ said Mr Thornton. Once again, last night it proved hard to verify the existence of such a title.

Mr Thornton denied nominating himself for the award and said he was put forward by a friend and former associate, Kantilal Chavda. ‘He has been a friend for many years but is not a martial artist himself,’ Mr Thornton said.

‘I have not put myself forward, I don’t think that’s allowed and its very insulting for anyone to suggest that. I feel like I’m being treated as a rogue, all my ranks can be traced back to my teachers in Japan.’

According to Mr Otto ‘anyone can invent an organisation or a martial art and label themselves a 10th Dan’.

Mr Thornton said he had been unable to teach his form of karate for a number of years because of an injury.

But he said: ‘My work is recognised by many organisations around the world. I don’t know why other people in this country don’t know me – I’m certainly known within my circles, and I feel the award is deserved.’

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘The nomination for Professor Alan Stanley Thornton, like any other, was considered on merit by the relevant independent committee, in this case the Sport Committee.

‘There are four criteria the committee particularly look at: sporting excellence; what they give back to the community and/or their sport; their length of service and career achievements; and what honours they already hold.’
