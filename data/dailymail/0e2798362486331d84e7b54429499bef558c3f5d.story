Row: MP Louise Mensch has been angered by comparisons with glamour model Jordan made by Michael Gove's wife

One is an outspoken Conservative MP, the other a former glamour model with enhanced breasts who is not known for her political views.

But now Louise Mensch and Jordan have been linked after their figures and faces were compared by a coalition minister's wife.

Mrs Mensch is said to have 'hit the roof' and complained to David Cameron after Sarah Vine, wife of Education Secretary Michael Gove, said she had 'pert, but modest-sized breasts'.

Her 'lithe and toned body' was 
described as 'pure Made In Chelsea' in comparison to The Only Way Is 
Essex look of Jordan who prefers to be known by her real name, Katie 
Price.

Ms Vine had responded to an interview in
 GQ magazine in which Mrs Mensch was photographed looking glamorous, but 
complained women politicians were judged on their appearance, according 
to the Sunday Independent.

She said it was sexist to 'trivialise' women politicians on the way they looked and not judge them on their political views.

Writing
 in the Times under the headline, 'Are you a Jordan or a Mensch?' Ms 
Vine said: 'Mensch is 40, but has the face of a 25-year-old. Who knows 
she may have great genes. Or not.

'Whatever, her look is typical of countless women her age of similar social status and means.

'A smooth face and clear complexion, pert but modest-sized breasts, a lithe and toned body - pure Made In Chelsea.

'At
 the other end of the scale is the TOWIE look as espoused by Paddy 
Doherty (reality star of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding), Katie Price and any 
number of orange acolytes.'

The writer said there were three classes people used to be categorised by -Â  upper, middle and working. 'Now you're either a Jordan, a Mensch or, like me, an unenhanced untermensch., 'she added.

A Downing Street spokeswoman said talks between the Prime Minister and his MPs were private. Mrs Mensch did not respond to repeated requests for comment, said the Independent.
