Small community newspapers, charities, think-tanks and even the Mumsnet parenting website could be hit with massive damages unless they sign up to the Government’s Royal Charter on Press regulation.

A leading freedom of expression charity highlighted the potential threat after a detailed study of controversial legislation which will curb the freedom of the Press.

In a major report, English PEN said the measures would have a ‘chilling’ effect on free speech. 

Mumsnet, which publishes news-related material, could fall under the legal definition of 'relevant publisher', which means it must sign up to the press regulation Royal Charter of face huge damages in libel cases

It warned that rather than being exempt from the laws, as the Government intended, tiny newspapers, campaign groups and political parties would be caught by them – while, incredibly, the sprawling BBC website (which is not regulated by Ofcom) would not.

Under the Royal Charter, so-called ‘relevant publishers’ must sign up to the new Parliament-approved Press Regulation Panel. 

Publications that refuse to comply face exemplary damages in libel cases. Newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up, fearing it would bring an end to 300 years of Press freedom.

Ministers insisted charities, not-for-profit community newspapers, specialist publications and political organisations would not need to join the regulator.

But the ‘poorly defined’ legislation means some of those organisations may actually fall into the category of ‘relevant publisher’, says English PEN. 

These include Amnesty International UK, which is made up of charities and registered companies, Decanter, a magazine for wine buffs which carries news and Mumsnet, which publishes news-related material.

Incredibly, the sprawling BBC website (which is not regulated by Ofcom) would not be caught by the new rules

Jo Glanville, director of English PEN, said: ‘Our analysis reveals a worrying level of uncertainty regarding the definition of “relevant publisher”.’

A spokesman for the Free Speech Network campaign group said: ‘It is particularly alarming to learn these draconian measures could apply – at crippling cost – to community newspapers and websites, blogs and hobby magazines, while a vast news operation like the BBC website is exempt.’

The Royal Charter was agreed between the three main political parties and Hacked Off after the Leveson Inquiry recommended ‘voluntary, independent self-regulation’.

The Independent Press Standards Organisation, which oversees the majority of newspapers including the Daily Mail and can impose £1million fines for serious and systemic wrongdoing, has said it will not seek recognition under the Charter.
