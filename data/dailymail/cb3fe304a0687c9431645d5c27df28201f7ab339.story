A jury in the trial of television presenter Justin Lee Collins - who is accused of harassing his ex-girlfriend - has today retired to consider its verdict.

After a 10-day trial at St Albans Crown Court the panel of nine women and three men began its deliberations regarding allegations that Collins subjected Anna Larke to domestic and emotional abuse.

The court heard claims during the case that the ex-comic, who made a name for himself with Channel 4's The Friday Night Project, made Ms Larke, a recovering alcoholic, write down in a Pukka pad all her previous sexual encounters regardless of how graphic.

The court heard that the 38-year-old did not want to write the details down but Ms Larke, a video games public relations worker, dictated them to him.

Collins, of Kew, south-west London, denies the charge of harassment and said Ms Larke, who moved in with him in January 2011, was obsessive, jealous and possessive and would send him a 'barrage' of text messages wanting to know where he was and who he was with.

Support: Karen Collins, pictured, the ex-wife of Justin Lee Collins previously told the court he was a 'gentle, kind and generous' man who had never laid a finger on her throughout their nine-year marriage

He also denies attacking her in any way.

Collins and Ms Larke met at a corporate event in 2006 and began an affair in 2007 to 2008 before splitting up.

The relationship resumed at the end of 2010 after the defendant's marriage to his wife Karen, the mother of his sons Archie, seven, and Harvey, four, broke down.

The former comedian and Ms Larke, 
also 38, lived together from January to July last year in a deeply 
troubled relationship as she tried to overcome alcoholism, the court has
heard.

Collins is accused 
of making her come off social networking websites, sleep facing him and 
throw away DVDs because they featured actors she found attractive.

He has denied all those claims and also denied making death threats against her.

Collins said the seven-month relationship with Ms Larke was 'absolute hell'.

'I thought she loved me and was crazy about me,' he said.

'But it turned out only the second part was true.'

The court also heard from Karen Collins, the ex-wife of Justin Lee 
Collins, who said he was a 'gentle, kind and generous' man who had never
laid a finger on her throughout their nine-year marriage.
