 

From admiring Lassie's intelligence  to cooing over the puppies in 101 Dalmatians, experts have found that films significantly influence the popularity of dog breeds chosen as pets.

And the effect can last for up to a decade, with the general success of the films mirroring the amount of a specific breed purchased.

For example, the 1943 blockbuster Lassie Come Home triggered a 40 per cent increase of collie registrations over the following two years.

The effect of doggie films such as The Shaggy Dog and Lassie (pictured) can effect the breeds of dogs that owners choose as pets for up to 10 years after their release, a study claims. These graphs show how Old English Sheepdogs, Collies, Dalmatians and other breeds soared in popularity after people saw the films (pictured right). Many people bought St Bernards after seeing Beethoven, but their popularity was short-lived

An even more dramatic example was the 100-fold increase in Old English Sheepdog registrations following the 1959 Disney movie The Shaggy Dog.

The influence of films on people’s choice of dog was strongest in the early 20th century and has since declined - but people still rushed out to buy St Bernard dogs after the 1992 film Beethoven.

Researchers used data from the American Kennel Club - which maintains the world’s largest dog registry totalling over 65 million dogs - for their study.

They looked at 87 films featuring dogs, The Shaggy Dog, Lassie Come Home, 101 Dalmatians, The Incredible Journey and Beethoven.

The scientists found that the release of films is often associated to an increase in popularity of featured breeds over periods of one, two, five and ten years. 

However, some films bucked the trend, with the number of people choosing Cocker Spaniels, for example falling after seeing the original version of Lady and the Tramp

They also discovered that the trends correlated with the how many people had seen the film on its opening weekend.

Viewing a movie may cause a long-lasting preference for a breed that can be expressed years later, when the time comes to buy a new dog, the study suggests.

The research was carried out by scientists from the University of Bristol, the City University of New York, and Western Carolina University and published in the journal PLOS One.

The 10 films with the strongest effect over a decade saw more than 800,000 dogs in total registered in the decade after their breed starred in a popular film.

‘We focused on changes in trend popularity rather than on popularity itself to avoid attributing to movies trends that were already ongoing before movie release, as up-trending breeds may have been chosen more often for movies,’ study lead author Professor Stefano Ghirlanda explained.

The influence of films on people’s choice of dog was strongest in the early 20th century and has since declined, but this graph shows the effect across the 87 films studied by the researchers, demonstrating that people are swayed by which breeds are popular in the media

There was a vast rise in the number of St Bernard dogs  chosen as pets in the five years following  the popular film, Beethoven released in 1992 (pictured left) - but the trend declined again afterwards with only a slight rise in popularity for the breed shown in a  decade (pictured in the graph, right)

They looked at 87 films featuring dogs, The Shaggy Dog, Lassie Come Home, 101 Dalmatians, The Incredible Journey  and Beethoven. After cinema goers watched the original Incredible Journey in 1963, the popularity of Retrievers (pictured centre) soared, while they fell after seeing the more modern version (still pictured)

The team discovered a general decrease during the century of movies’ influence on the success of dog breeds.

Earlier movies are associated with generally larger trend changes than later films and the researchers said this might be due to an increased competition with other media, such as television, and more recently, the internet, - but also increased competition among movies.

Movies featuring dogs were released at a rate of less than one per year until about 1940, but a rate of more than seven per year by 2005.

The researchers had previously shown how dynamics in dog breed popularity are subject to the ‘erratic fluctuations’ typical of fashion and fads. 

Surprisingly, Lady and The Tramp (film poster pictured left) was among the movies that saw the popularity of certain breeds decrease. Less people registered Cocker Spaniels (Lady's breed)  as pets than they did before watching the original 1955 film

Viewing a movie may cause a long-lasting preference for a breed that can be expressed years later, when the time comes to buy a new dog, the study suggests. There have been a number of 101 Dalmatians films since the first was released in 161 and saw a huge rise in the popularity of the breed

There has been a rise in the number of 'Wolf breed' dogs such as huskies up for adoption in pet rehoming centres.

The trend has been blamed on the Twilight films and Game of Thrones as people rushed out to buy a puppy, not realising how energetic the breeds can be.

Blue Cross, which cares for ill and abandoned pets, said the number of huskies and similar breeds taken to its 12 rehoming centres across the UK had increased by 700 per cent over the past five years.

Animal charity Dogs Trust has a total of 34 Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies at its 19 rehoming centres.

Lynn Barber, its head of training and behaviour, said yesterday: ‘These dogs are beautiful creatures and can make wonderful companions, but they need owners who understand the demands of this breed and are in a position to offer a lifetime commitment.’

For example, they discovered that the more rapidly puppy registrations increased, the more rapidly their popularity declined, a phenomena also found for the popularity of baby names.

The study demonstrated that the popularity of breeds is unrelated to breed temperament and health.

Hal Herzog, co-author of the paper, said: ‘On the whole, breeds with more desirable behaviours, greater longevity, and fewer inherited genetic disorders did not become more popular than other breeds.

‘In short, cultural shifts in types of pets largely reflect ephemeral changes in fashion rather than selection for functional traits.”

Dr Alberto Acerbi, of Bristol University, said: ‘If people buy en masse dogs because they appear in movies the consequences can be negative for the dogs themselves.

‘Our previous study found that the most popular breeds had the greatest number of inherited disorders. It’s not surprising that we tend to follow social cues and fashions, as this is a quite effective strategy in many situations.

‘However, in particular cases the outcomes can be negative. When choosing a new pet, we may want to act differently.’
