Actress Asher Keddie's husband Vincent Fantauzzo has won the Archibald's People Choice Award for a fourth time, becoming the most successful artist in the category's 26-year history.

The dreamy self-portrait, All That's Good In Me, is modelled on his four-year-old son, Luca, who is dressed in a Superman costume.

It makes it back-to-back wins for Fantauzzo, who also scooped the accolade last year for a canvas of his then girlfriend actress Asher Keddie. The pair tied the knot in a secret wedding ceremony in Fiji in early April.

The youngster accompanied his father in accepting the $2500 award at the Art Gallery of NSW on Thursday, along with proud wife Keddie.

But the Melbourne-based painter isn't taking all the credit for his artwork.

'He helped me out a lot ... he did heaps of the background, all the good, expressive drippy bits.'

Fantauzzo thanked the public once again.

'For my paintings to resonate so well with the public makes me feel that they understood why I painted Luca.

'I think the children in our lives, whether it be grandchildren or our own children or nieces and nephews, are such a reflection on us and make us behave the way we do,' Fantauzzo said.

Fantauzzo said of Luca: 'He helped me out a lot ... he did heaps of the background, all the good, expressive drippy bits'

'Plus, Luca's so cute and it's much better to be remembered in a cute self,' he told AAP.

He won People's Choice in 2008 for his portrait of a tormented Heath Ledger, painted weeks before the actor's death.

Again in 2009 for his depiction of child actor Brandon Walters.

More than 16,000 votes were cast by exhibition goers with comedian Anh Do's stirring portrait of his father a runner-up of the 54 Archibald finalists.

Fantauzzo also won the prize last year for his painting of then girlfriend Asher Keddie, titled Love Face

He wowed in 2008 with his image of 'Heath', a portrait of late actor Heath Ledger, which also won the Archibald Prize

In July, Fiona Lowry won the main prize for her ethereal portrait of architect Penelope Seidler while the Packing Room Prize went to Tim Storrier's canvas of Sir "Les" Patterson.

The public vote has only seen eye to eye with the prize jury twice.

Once in 1988 with Fred Cress' depiction of the artist John Beard and in 2004 with Craig Ruddy's portrait of actor David Gulpilil.

In 2009 he won for his depiction of child actor Brandon Walters

Fantauzzo is now the most successful artist in the category's 26-year history
