Wielding her signature pink AK-47 and posing like her idol Kim Kardashian, this is the alleged new leader of an elite kill squad used by one of Mexico's deadliest drug cartels.

Claudia Ochoa Felix, nicknamed The Empress of Antrax, is thought to be the new leader of the 'Los Antrax' hit squad, used by the Sinaloa cartel to carry out executions and revenge attacks.

The 27-year-old uses social media to brag about her lifestyle, posting pictures of herself holding guns, posing with a leopard, and strutting around in tight outfits and swimsuits.

Claudia is the lover of former Los Antrax leader Jose Rodrigo Arechiga Gamboa, 33, but is thought to have taken over from him after he was arrested in January

With her signature pink AK-47, Claudia is reported to be in charge of Los Antrax, a hit squad who carry out executions on behalf of the Sinaloa cartel

The shots even include images of her
 children lying with hundreds of banknotes surrounding them in
 the bath or on the bed.

U.S. intelligence sources have named the Sinaloa cartel as 'the most powerful drug trafficking organization in the world', and they are thought to be responsible for much of the heroin smuggled into America.

Claudia also posts pictures of her children, including this snap of her son covered in stacks of bank notes

If there is a dirty 
job that needs to be sorted out, Los Antrax get the assignment. They are also in charge of security for the cartel boss 
Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, 66.

Claudia married a Sinaloa drug 
trafficker known as 'El Chavo' Felix with whom she had three children - 
however they later separated.

Despite her ostentatious lifestyle, Claudia managed to avoid public attention until Yurina Castillo Torres, 23, was shot dead on May 7 in an apparent botched assassination after being mistaken for Claudia.

According to local media report the two looked similar and were from the same area.

Los Antrax also provide security for the cartel's feared and respected boss, Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, 66

Despite the threat to her life, Claudia regularly goes out clubbing around Mazatlan, Culiacan and Guadalajara, but always takes armed bodyguards with her

Despite the attack, Claudia has refused to go underground and can still be seen clubbing in the main discos and nightclubs of Mazatlan, Culiacan and Guadalajara.

The only difference is that this time she is always surrounded by heavily armed men who protect her.

Despite the attempt on her life, Claudia denies any connection to any criminal organisation, saying claims about her are 'cowardly lies and slander'.

A deadly drugs war has raged in Mexico since 2006 and has claimed an estimated 100,000 lives as gangs fight over territory and carry out revenge killings.
