There were 11,419 gun deaths in the U.S. in 2013, according to statistics compiled by live data firm Periscopic.

And yet man are still finding new ways in which to kill each other more effectively with firearms.

A new bullet has been developed that make it almost impossible to miss a target - not to mention even deadlier.

Developed by Advanced Ballistics Concepts, the projectile expands into four connected parts as soon as it is fired, according to Gizmodo.

Dodge this: A new bullet has been developed by Advanced Ballistics Concepts to expand into four connected parts as soon as it is fired

Once leaving the tip of a gun, the round becomes a multi-pellet shot.

Three fragments separate from the original bullet to form a predetermined diameter, while still being connected to the source.

Called the Mi-Bullet, when fired from a handgun the diameter is 14 inches.

When coming from a shotgun the diameter is 24 inches.

ABC officials say they designed the bullet to improve first and second shot accuracy for shooters in 'high pressure situations'.

Stage one: The Mi-Bullet leaves the chamber and already the round starts to slightly separate

As seen in this animation, after just 0.0012 seconds of being shot the Mi-Bullet is expanding into place

The three fragments that separate from the original source are still connected, making the bullet different from shotgun shrapnel

Finally, by just 0.008 second, the Mi-Bullet claims it can expand to its full diameter, which is different between handguns and shotguns, ranging from 14 to 24 inches

The Mi-Bullet supposedly maintains its accuracy by utilizing an accelerated radial spread aided by the rifled barrel, officials say.

The larger diameter makes it harder to miss, the company said.

ABC designed three levels of the Mi-Bullet to include non-lethal (Mi-Stinger), semi-lethal (Mi-Stunner) and the fully lethal (Mi-Stopper).

The Mi-Bullet is designed for most popular handgun and shotgun cartridges.

It will be on display next week the 2014 SHOT Show in Las Vegas.
