A toddler is lucky to be alive after he had to be dramatically rescued from a hot car by firefighters at a San Jose shopping mall on Monday after his mom left him while she ran an errand.

Authorities estimate that the child was left alone in the car for between 5 and 10 minutes and say the mom could now face child neglect charges.

Passing shoppers at the Fallas Shopping Center noticed the child left alone in the baking vehicle and promptly notified authorities.

The rescue of the toddler by San Jose firefighters was caught on video by one shopper. Police have credited the quick actions of firefighters with saving the boy’s life.

They managed to pop the lock and then pulled the boy who was sweaty and crying boy from the vehicle.

Once out of the car, the firefighters stripped the two-year old down and rushed him to a waiting ambulance.

'You know we had the air conditioner going on. We tried everything we can just to bring the patient's temperature down,' firefighter and paramedic Joshua Scheib told KTVU.

The temperature at the shopping center on Monday afternoon was 92 degrees, while the temperature inside a vehicle can typically increase 19 degrees inside the first ten minutes. 

The mother apparently told detectives from the San Jose Police Department that she and a second child had just ran into the store for a minute.

'Obviously, whatever the mother explained to the officers there at the scene and to the detective, all that's going to play into what the DA decides to do with this case,' said Officer Albert Morales. 

So far this year 26 children have died in hot cars across the country.
