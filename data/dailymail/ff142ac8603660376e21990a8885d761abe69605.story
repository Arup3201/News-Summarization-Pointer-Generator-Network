She made her debut as a fresh-faced ingénue in a long-since departed British 'bodice ripper' drama when she was just 23.

And as actress and producer Trudie Styler prepares to celebrate her 60th birthday next month, she admits there is a ‘paucity’ of roles in Hollywood for women over 40.

The evergreen blonde, married to rocker Sting, has most recently produced movie hit Filth and in an exclusive interview with MailOnline, she says: ‘Look at George Clooney…I’m a huge admirer of his, but when he plays a leading man in a love story, his love interest is always 10 years his junior.

Unfair: Actress and producer Trudie Styler says male stars like George Clooney will always have love interests 10 years younger - as Hollywood 'always wants to rose tint everything'

Happy New Yorkers: Trudie Styler and Sting attend an opening night party for her new play, The Seagull, in New York in October

‘Why not have an actress the same age 
as him?  Hollywood always wants to rose tint everything, but this 
doesn’t even reflect real life.

‘In life, you see younger men and older women and the majority of marriages don’t have such a huge age gap as we're used to seeing in films.’

Oscar winner Clooney, 52, has appeared in movie hits over the past few decades with a string of female stars.

In 2009's Up In The Air, he had a doomed romance with Vera Farmiga, now 40.

While he
 wooed Jennifer Lopez, now 44, in as Out of Sight, as well as Catherine 
Zeta Jones, also 44, in Intolerable Cruelty, as well as Renee Zellwegger - now also 44 - 
in Leatherheads.

'I’m
 a very lucky woman and have been extremely fortunate in the way that my
 life has been for nigh on 30 years, with my husband looking after me 
beautifully...I 
don’t have any room at all for any complaints, there will always be 
detractors'

And in real life, ladies man George's last three girlfriends have been much younger than him, with him dating Stacy Keblier, 34,  Elisabetta Canalis, 35, and Sarah Larsen, 32

Mother-of-four Trudie - who made her TV debut on 1970s period drama Poldark - adds: ‘My
 daughter Mickey is an actress and I tell her women need to make their 
own films, they should always be looking for stories to develop 
themselves and go to acting class – not that she needs much prompting in
 that!

‘It’s just important that actresses should realise that acting isn’t their only string.

‘We
 see that for an actress in her early 40s, there is a paucity of roles, work does become thinner as opposed to what you are offered in your 20s 
and 30s.

‘Leading women are being replaced by younger actresses.’

In
 2011, Trudie set up Maven Pictures alongside business partner Celine 
Rattray, who won a Golden Globe – as well as an Oscar nod - for 
producing 2010 hit The Kids Are All Right, starring Julianne Moore and 
Annette Bening.

And asked whether she felt helped or hindered by her 
marriage to one of music’s most famous men – and a reputation that has 
not always been so glowing, Trudie, who will celebrate her milestone birthday on January 6, replies: ‘It’s an interesting 
question…

‘The Trudie Styler that is spoken of is extremely privileged in life and feels that privilege.

‘I’m
 a very lucky woman and have been extremely fortunate in the way that my
 life has been for nigh on 30 years, with my husband looking after me 
beautifully.

‘We love each other and we are loved by our children, I 
don’t have any room at all for any complaints, there will always be 
detractors, that's just the way of the world.

On their wedding day: Sting and Trudie married in 1992 and renewed their vows this year

‘We carry on with the work we believe in, there are 
things you aspire to, and I want to give a voice to those who don’t have
 a loud voice.

‘Those who don’t get out of the fractured rain forest 
that I’ve been looking at since the 1980s in Brazil or the Ecuadorian 
Amazon, who have had their rights taken away.

Debut: Trudie Styler playing Emma Tregirls in Brit 1970s period drama Poldark

Maven’s most recent project was Filth, the big screen adaption of Scots writer Irvine Welsh’s novel, starring James McAvoy.

The
 movie has been nominated for five gongs at Sunday night’s British 
Independent Film Awards including best actor for James, best supporting 
actor for Eddie Marsan and best supporting actress for Shirley 
Henderson.

And obviously proud, Trudie says: ‘We’re looking at making
 awards-worthy movies, it’s harder than making a $200million picture, 
because we’re looking at a product of substance with ideas.’

Maven this year released Girl Most Likely, starring Bridesmaids breakout star Kirsten Wiig and with Trudie and Sting's daughter Mickey, 29, in a role.

And
 With Cate Blanchett – full of Oscar buzz for Blue Jasmine - signed up 
to star in Cancer Vixen: A True Story, to be helmed by Julie Delpy, 
alongside Amy Adams starring in an adaptation of Steve Martin’s novel, 
Object of Beauty, Maven are making a name for themselves as producers of
 strong female-driven films.

Although setting up Maven has not been 
plain sailing, Trudie says: ‘We want to encourage more and more women 
and we want to tell them ‘we really want your business and take you 
seriously.’

Nominated: Filth - produced by Trudie Styler and production partner Celine Rattray - is up for five gongs at the British Independent Film Awards on Sunday

Talented: James McAvoy and Eddie Marsan star in Filth, the big-screen adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel

Female-driven:  Maven Pictures this year produced Girl Most Likely starring Bridesmaids break-out star Kristen Wiig and Annette Bening

But with the success of Filth, Trudie laughs as she 
admits: ‘Look at Filth – it’s quite misogynistic! I was in Lock, Stock 
and Two Smoking Barrels and I like my bad boy movie movies.

‘And I really love Irvine Welsh and what he’s done for guilty pleasures, he makes us think and his novels provoke and stimulate.

‘It
 is a modern tragedy that James is so brilliant in and I hope he will 
garner laurels and win something this weekend and get a BAFTA nod.

‘The cast have done us proud, we’re very proud of Shirley and Eddie – and I’m very proud of it as I was so hands on with it.

In October, Trudie made an acting comeback on Broadway in Chekhov’s The 
Seagull and reveals: ‘I did get bit by the acting bug again, it was a 
four-act Chekhov play and I don’t think I’ve played that kind of role 
before, it was very challenging and ultimately very gratifying.

Then: Sting and Trudie in the Eighties

Now: 32 years later, Trudie said 'I love him more each day'

Advice: Trudie Styler says she has told her actress daughter Mickey to make sure she has more than one string to her bow. The pair are seen at the Girl Most Likely screening in New York in July

Accompanied by Sting at the opening night party in the city where the couple have made their home, Trudie told The Times they prefer living in the U.S. after being 'treated unkindly' in their home 
country.

She said: 'I don't want to criticise 
my country but there are times I feel Sting and myself have been treated
 unkindly. I feel much more relaxed here, not having to second guess 
myself.'

She added: 'Rock stars' wives have never been given an easy time. They weren't nice about Linda McCartney until she died.'

Strong women: Oscar favourite Cate Blanchett has signed up to star in Maven Pictures' Cancer Vixen: A True Story, while Amy Adams will star in their adaption of Steve Martin's novel,  Object of Beauty

And now Trudie is planning another theatrical jaunt, this time alongside her friend Sean Mathias, planned for next year.

Written by the late British playwright Pam Gems,called Savage Love, Trudie says: 'It’s about an aging Arthur and Guinevere. Guinevere is on trial for her life for her adulterous, long-term affair with Lancelot and meanwhile, Arthur is living at court with all his bastard children, and she ain’t gonna take it lying down. So it’s a bit of a face-off and a portrait of their marriage, really. And it’s a very brilliantly written piece about women’s rights and relationships.'

And with that, Trudie adds defiantly: ‘People will say what they want to say, but I don’t really answer my critics.’
