Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has furiously denied talk of a problem between himself and assistant manager Ryan Giggs and has absolved defender Jonny Evans of any blame in the spitting incident with Newcastle's Papiss Cisse on Wednesday night.

United win 1-0 at St James Park on Wednesday was notable for the fact Giggs did not appear keen to celebrate Ashley Young's late winner.

Van Gaal said on Thursday: 'I am very irritated with this question.

'Everybody can see we have a good relationship.

'We work very hard together me with the players and the staff.

'I am very irritated about this. I am not pleased. A suggestion about a poor relationship is wrong.

'I am a fact man.'

Minutes before Thursday's press conference, United defender Evans had denied spitting at Cisse on Wednesday night in a statement released by the club. Cisse, on the other hand, has apologised for his actions.

Van Gaal said: 'I have spoken with Jonny and that is why I am late.

'When he was spitting on the ground maybe it was a human reaction. It was not his intention and I believe him.'

The FA are waiting for referee Anthony Taylor's report. As he missed the incident between Jonny Evans and Pappis Cisse, it is unlikely the it will be included in his report - meaning the FA can retrospectively punish the pair. 

Hull striker George Boyd was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. 

However, the FA have issued new guidelines to move in line with new FIFA guidelines meaning Evans and Cisse could now be banned for six games.  

Asked about whether he feared the FA would charge Evans, Van Gaal replied briefly.

He said: 'I think the FA is very wise.'

Evans released a statement on Thursday, denying the allegations that he spat at the Newcastle striker. 

The statement on Manchester United's official website read: 'Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night's match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse.

'I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting.

'It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.'

Conversely, Papiss Cisse has said since apologised to his team-mates, fans, and even Evans, saying he spat back at the Northern Irishman as a reaction to something 'very unpleasant.'
