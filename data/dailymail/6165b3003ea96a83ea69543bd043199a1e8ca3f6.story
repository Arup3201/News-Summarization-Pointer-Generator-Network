It costs more than the UK's average house price, and more than ten times the UK's average annual salary.

But if money is no object, and you've already spent quarter of a million on a Roller, then perhaps a £275,000 parking space is the logical next step.

An estate agency in Knightsbridge is marketing an underground parking space near the Royal Albert Hall in central London for the mind-boggling six-figure sum.

Money well spent? The £275,000 parking space is located close to London's Royal Albert Hall

And in case you were wondering 'Why so cheap?', the answer is that it won't be yours for ever: the space is for sale on an 84-year lease.

This exclusive parking space is situated in an underground, gated car park on Prince Consort Road in London's SW7, just a stone's throw from Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park.

Agents WA Ellis, whose offices overlook Harrods, describe it as a space that could 'easily accommodate a Rolls Royce or two medium-sized cars'.

The firm's Robert Lewis, who is selling it, said the space would cost a lot more if it were nearer Harrods.

He said: 'We generally see garages come on the market for between £180,000 and £275,000.

'A lot of people have townhouses and flats that are Victorian and don't have parking, and people don't want to park their Ferraris in the street; this is a secure underground car park.

'It can also be beneficial for people's insurance and if you were selling a house nearby you could sell it "With parking".

'The garages and spaces we sell near Harrods can sell for a lot more, you often see Bugatti Veyrons parked in there.

'There isn't a lot of parking in central London so people like to know they have always got a space.'

The average house price in the UK at the
 moment is £162,638.  In Yorkshire this falls to £157,157 and in the North
 West it is £154,678. In Greater London homeowners can expect to fork 
out £445,641, but the average house price in the City of Westminster, where this parking space is found, is an eye-watering £1,278,787.

Expensive address: You'd be unlikely to afford an actual flat with just £275,000 in Prince Consort Road

If you've got £275,000 to spend but don't want a parking space in Knightsbridge, there are plenty of other options for you.

At just £17,000 each on the road, you could afford not just one but 15 Ford Focus Zetecs.  Somewhat smaller than a Rolls Royce, these might be easier to park in a tight spot, and the insurance premium will be lower, too.

If you are looking for a home for yourself rather than your car, there are plenty of affordable options for sale in the Lancashire town of Burnley.

Local agent Frost & Co are putting a two-bedroomed house in Dall Street up for auction next Wednesday with a starting bid of £1,000, which would leave you plenty of change to replace the metal screens with actual windows.

In sought-after Fulham, south west London, £275,000 will buy you a one-bedroom flat above a furniture shop on Lillie Road, though it could do with a little decorating.

Meanwhile for the same sum you could buy a three-bedroom house in Morden, near New Malden, complete with driveway and double glazing.

Alternatively, you could extend your budget by £10,000 and buy another Rolls Royce.  A five-door, eight-speed Rolls Royce Phantom costs from £285,200 on the road while, if you're going for broke, a long wheelbase version will set you back £336,700.  And that's before you've paid to park it.
