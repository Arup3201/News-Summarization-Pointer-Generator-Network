Real Madrid have no interest in signing David de Gea because they already have a better goalkeeper, according to former club president Ramon Calderon.

Manchester United's Spanish stopper De Gea has attracted considerable praise for his performances this season, leading many to suggest the 24-year-old could be set for a move back to his home country. 

But Calderon has dismissed such speculation, insisting that current Real captain Iker Casillas is a better player, and Keylor Navas a more than capable back-up option.

'We already have the best goalkeeper in the world, which is Casillas,' Calderon told talkSPORT. 'We also have just bought Keylor Navas. I don't see any need to get any other goalkeeper.

'De Gea is perhaps also one of the top five goalkeepers in the world but Casillas can still be at the top for three or four years. I don't see any need [for De Gea].' 

United last week took on another Spanish goalkeeper when fromer Barcelona star Victor Valdes signed an 18-month deal at Old Trafford.

Meanwhile, Real are in possession of the world's best player after Cristiano Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or for a third time on Monday evening. Calderon believes it is no less than he deserves.

'I think he deserved what he got,' Calderon said. 'Not only have we been talking many times about his talent and skill, which are huge, but his determination, sacrifice and endeavour. I cant think where his limits are.'
