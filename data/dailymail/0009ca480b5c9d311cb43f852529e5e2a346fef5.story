Teacher Jennifer Thompson, 52, failed to report a student who allegedly took moonshine to class 

A longtime science teacher in Ohio has been reprimanded for failing to report a student who allegedly took a bottle of illegal liquor he had produced to class.

Jennifer Thompson, 52, who has taught at Riverside middle school in De Graff for more than 20 years, reportedly tipped the moonshine down the drain when she was shown it but did not alert authorities.

According to Dayton Daily News, she was issued with a formal warning letter as a result, while the pupil in question was suspended from school.

Thompson apparently knew the 13-year-old boy and another 14-year-old had created a still and were starting to produce alcohol.

While she warned the duo it could be 'dangerous', investigators claim the tutor took no strict action to stop the operation.

In January, a report from the Logan County Sheriff says the student brought some of the liquor to show in science class. 

Thompson disposed of it instead of alerting the principle.

Under Ohio law, the illegal manufacture of moonshine is considered a first-degree misdemeanor - carrying the same charges as crimes including petty theft or assault. 

It is unclear whether the boy who took the moonshine to class will face juvenile delinquency charges in the case.

In the meantime he is said to be awaiting an expulsion hearing led by Riverside Schools.

It is unclear how the news of the incident emerged.

Riverside Local Schools Superintendent Scott Mann said he doesn't believe the student realized the seriousness of his actions.

'I think he wanted to show his science teacher and I don’t think there was malicious intent at all,' he noted.
