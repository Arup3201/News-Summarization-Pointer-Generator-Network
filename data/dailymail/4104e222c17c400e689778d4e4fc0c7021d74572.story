 A British man has died after after his boat was overturned by a freak wave at a port in Spain.

Tug boat captain Paul Sydney, 66, was returning to his vessel on a Zodiac-style inflatable dinghy after going to fetch a takeaway dinner with three crew members.

Mr Sydney and a British colleague were tipped into the water when the wave hit them just after 7pm yesterday evening at the entrance to Almeria Port in south east Spain.

Colleagues hanging onto the stricken dinghy managed to get a life ring to the survivor.

But they lost contact with Mr Sydney and his body was pulled out of the water half an hour after the accident by a passing police boat as a coastguard rescue vessel was scrambled.

The crew's tug boat, GPS Battler, had stopped in Almeria for engine repairs after dredging work in Menorca.

It was due to set sail for Galicia in north west Spain once the repairs were complete.

A spokesman for the local coastguard said: 'They had left the tug to fetch food in an inflatable and were hit by a larger than normal wave as they returned which overturned the dinghy.

'The two Brits were thrown into the sea and maintained contact with each other for about 15 minutes as they tried to swim back to the boat.

'Another member of the tug's crew reached the survivor with a life ring but couldn't find the dead man when he went after him.

'A passing Civil Guard boat plucked his body out of the water after spotting the overturned dinghy and going to its rescue.'

A Civil Guard spokesman said: 'Officers tried to resuscitate him on board their vessel which happened to be passing through the area where the dinghy had overturned.

'Sadly there was nothing they could do to save his life.'

GPS Battler was part of a fleet of tugs, barges and pontoons owned by Chatham, Kent-based marine contractors GPS Marine.

No-one from the firm was available for comment this morning.

It is not known where in Britain Mr Sydney was from.
