Each party season, women face the dilemma whether to wear their hair long and straight or sacrifice centimetres for bouncy waves.

In the final installment of our Christmas hair special, celebrity hairdresser Mark Woolley, who styles Sienna Miller, shows how with the addition of a subtle hair weft, girls no longer have to choose.

MailOnline writer Hanna models the ultimate Nicole Scherzinger look with an exact match of her real-hair extensions.

MailOnline writer Hanna explains how when she curls her hair she loses length - but she no longer has to

Celebrity stylist Mark Woolley shows the pre-curled weft he will be using to lengthen Hanna's curls

Nicole, pictured yesterday, wears the same Beauty Works hair weft used in Hanna's hair. She curls her hair and maintains her length with clever extensions

'Prepare your extension(s) by putting them into heated rollers or using a tong. We recommend using real-hair extensions so you can use high heat on them and style them as you like. Leave them to the side to take shape while you prepare your natural hair.

'Brush the hair and section it with a comp and grips.

'Begin curling it curl section by section working from the nape of the neck up to the top.

'Use a ceramic tong or similar to care for the hair, and opt for a wider barrel if you want to match Nicole's look.

'We used a variable temperature Diva pro Styling Argan Tong in 38mm.'

Mark sections the hair in step one, using a comb

Tong the hair from the bottom up and pin in place as you go for long lasting waves

'As you work your way up the head, make sure you are spraying each section with hairspray before you curl it for extra hold.

'Allow each curl to drop into your palm immediately after it leaves the tong, so that it dries in your hand in the coil shape.

Immediately clip it to the head in the curl shape for hold.'

Spray the hair as you go for extra hold - you want this look to last all night

When you tong a section, let it fall and cool in a coil in your palm to hold the shape

'Now it's time to clip in your pre-curled weft. Allow the natural hair to fall over it.

'For Hanna's look we used the exact match 20" Deluxe Remy Instant Clip-In Extensions from Beauty Works in the Blondette shade, 4/27. Nicole Scherzinger wears these Â£119.99 clip-ins herself.

'Spray the hair with hairspray and you're ready to go.'

Hanna is thrilled when with the addition of one extension she can keep her length
