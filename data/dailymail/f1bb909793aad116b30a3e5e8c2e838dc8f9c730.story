Harry Redknapp will not order Rio Ferdinand to end his media commitments but is convinced the centre-half will focus squarely on Queens Park Rangers for the next 12 months.

Redknapp believes 35-year-old Ferdinand, who won six Barclays Premier League titles, is motivated by a desire to prove he can still perform at the top after losing his place at Manchester United.

'What we’re paying him here isn’t going to change his life,' said the QPR boss. 'He can walk away, do anything he wants. He’s on the A-Team at the BBC, up there with Alan Hansen and Alan Shearer at the World Cup final, the day they had to go bosh and pick the top three pundits.

'He’s got a great future if he wants in television. I wouldn’t want to him on TV at 5.30 on a Saturday night, after coming off 10 minutes from the end.

'There was a player a few years ago who kept turning up on the radio on “606” and I thought: "How on earth has he got there?"'

Ferdinand rejected moves to Tottenham and West Ham and mind-bogglingly lucrative offers to play abroad. He started life at QPR with a double training session on Friday.

He impressed as a World Cup pundit at the BBC and will continue to work as an ambassador for BT Sport but Redknapp insisted: 'Rio is going to concentrate on his football.

'He’s a focused boy. He’s genuine. He’s got other business interests but he won’t come here unless he’s sure. Why mug yourself off when you’ve been a top player? Why put yourself under that pressure for a few quid?

'He’s not stupid. He’s doing it because he believes he can still play at the top level. He wants to come here and play football. Otherwise he would have walked away to be an ambassador in Indonesia or earn a fortune in Qatar. He said: "No, I want to play football." He’s here to play.'

Redknapp has earned a reputation in his career for squeezing a few more years from high-calibre footballers, including Paul Merson, Teddy Sheringham and Sol Campbell.

'You will always get doubters and people who say he’s finished,' said the QPR boss. 'I back my own judgement and opinion. Everybody said Sol was finished when I took him and he was as good as any centre-half in the Premier League.

'Rio didn’t need convincing. He wanted to come to QPR. He spoke to two top London clubs, but he wanted to come here and to play. He could have gone elsewhere and maybe not played at times.'

2014-NOW: QPR

There was also a glowing reference from Ryan Giggs, who confirmed Ferdinand was in good physical shape, despite only started 21 games for Manchester United last season, and theories that he was not able to play twice in a week.

Redknapp said: 'I spoke to Ryan, not that I had doubts, just to ask how much training Rio did and Ryan said if he had still had been his manager this year then he would have been his No.1 centre-half. When he took over last year the first thing he did was put Rio back in the team.

'He was fit all year, but David (Moyes) came in and wanted to change the team around. He didn’t pick him. We got his records from Man United and he was the fourth or fifth highest player, in terms of being available for training and playing.'

Ferdinand will not have to wait long to go back to Old Trafford. QPR are due there on September 14.

Redknapp was manager at West Ham when he first saw Ferdinand and pipped Millwall to sign the schoolboy.

'He came and played in our youth team 
and from Day One I knew,' said the QPR boss. 'When he was 16, I said he 
would be the best defender in Europe one day and he was. I wasn’t a bad 
judge really.

'I was away 
with the first-team at Newcastle one day when the youth team had Chelsea
 and my Dad went to watch and said he’d seen the best kid he’d seen in 
years.

'I went through about
 seven of our kids and he kept saying no. Then he said Ferdinand. I said
 "nah, he couldn’t have played Dad, he is still a schoolboy." It was a 
Southern Junior Floodlight Cup final.

'I
 was at the first game, when we lost - we got beat something like 4-2 - 
and then we won the second leg at Stamford Bridge and we won the cup on 
aggregate.

'When
 I spoke to our youth team manager Tony Carr and asked if Rio Ferdinand 
had played he said he’d never seen anything like it. He played in 
midfield. Fantastic.'

Redknapp
 expects Ferdinand to bring a positive influence to Loftus Road on and 
off the pitch, and the first of those may be to convince Steven Caulker 
to sign.

Cardiff have accepted a bid from QPR for Caulker but Crystal Palace are also interested.

'He
 would like to play with Rio,' said Redknapp. 'He feels if he plays with
 Rio it would help him get back on track with the England team, which I 
think he is capable of doing. It’s still not done. We agreed a fee a 
couple of weeks back.'

He 
did not deny interest in Norwich pair Leroy Fer and Nathan Redmond, and 
wants to sign Kolbeinn Sigthorsson from Ajax but admitted it was 'dragging on a bit'.

Loic 
Remy wants to leave for Champions League football, Adel Taarabt is keen 
to return to AC Milan where he spent last season on loan, and the QPR 
boss would like to recruit more players but he is wary not to repeat the
 same mistakes the club made when they were last promoted to the top 
flight and loaded the squad with players of questionable quality on 
bloated contracts.

'We are 
determined not to make those mistakes again,' said Redknapp. 'I think 
(chairman) Tony (Fernandes) and the board have learned from that so we 
have got to make sure this time as best we can we make the right 
decisions and get the right characters in here.

'We
 don’t want people who are going to come here just for the money and not
 be interested in the club. We want people genuinely want to come here 
and play and do well for us.'
