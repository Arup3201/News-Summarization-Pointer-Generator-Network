Accused bullier Richie Incognito has urged his alleged victim Jonathan Martin to call him through a string of Twitter messages posted Monday.

Incognito, who was suspended from the Miami Dolphins after Martin accused him of bullying him using racial slurs, returned to social media last week following unspecified treatment.

In the early hours of Monday morning, he posted two messages directed at his former teammate that were visible to his 92,000 followers.

Call for help: Incognito has been tweeting since finishing his unspecified treatment program

'@J_Martin71 Call me on my cell phone.  Love you brother.  Sh** got crazy but we held it together.  #CALLME #FAMILY,' he wrote.

'@j_martin71 No hard feelings.  Let's just move on :).'

Back to his roots: Martin has been signed to the San Francisco 49ers which is headed by his old Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh

For his part, Martin has not responded and appears to be moving on his own way by training with his new teammates on the San Francisco 49ers.

'Back to work... #Rise&Grind,' he wrote about nine hours after Incognito's tweets.

A person familiar with Incognito's situation said the veteran lineman was exhausted after being 'dragged through the mud' in recent months.

An NFL investigation determined Incognito and two other Miami Dolphins offensive linemen engaged in persistent harassment of teammate Jonathan Martin, who left the team in October.

Incognito was then suspended and missed the final eight games, and he became a free agent last week when his contract with the Dolphins expired.

'Looking forward to getting back to work ASAP,' Incognito tweeted Tuesday, punctuating the comment with a smiley face.

Incognito sent tweets last month that varied dramatically in tone. He went on a rant that quickly went viral, blasting Martin and his agent, then later tweeted apologies to Martin, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross and Ted Wells, the attorney who investigated the bullying scandal for the NFL.

For his part, Martin has been picked up by the San Francisco team by a familiar face.

San Francisco's Jim Harbaugh once sat in Martin's living room to recruit him, coached him for three years at Stanford and developed Martin into an All-American and a second-round draft pick, then stood by him from afar as Martin accused a Miami teammate of bullying last year.

'I believe everybody deserves an Etch-A-Sketch opportunity and an opportunity to start a new chapter,' Harbaugh said.

'Because of my relationship recruiting Jonathan, and (I) coached Jonathan for three years at Stanford, I'm confident he will be committed to the mission and the organization. Very excited about it.'

Martin is back in a place he can feel safe as he starts over on the football field.
