A stunning collection of interior designs from the famous Arts and Crafts Movement of the 19th century is set to sell for £250,000.

Many of the items in the huge collection of rugs, wall hangings, carpets, curtains and furniture relate to the celebrated British designer William Morris.

It spans dozens of lots and was commissioned by wealthy West Midlands brewery owner Laurence W Hodson in order to refurbish his family home, Compton Hall, in 1895.

Each of the four watercolour and pencil drawings - the fox, hare, raven and lion - are worth £6,000

Hodson was a friend and patron of William Morris whose last wallpaper design was named 'Compton' in honour of his important client.

The collection includes four original watercolour and pencil drawings for Morris' famous 1887 handwoven 'The Forest' tapestry that is held at the V&A Museum in London.

The 'exquisite' work by Philip Webb shows a fox, a hare, a raven and a lion are worth £6,000 each.

There is a delicate 'Honeysuckle' 
embroidered silk wall hanging designed by Morris and created by his wife
Jane in 1876 that is up for sale for £8,000.

An exquisite hand-knotted carpet made by Morris & Co in 1916 is also being auctioned for £8,000.

The
hoard has been passed down from generation to generation in the Hodson 
family over the last 75 years and is now being sold by Dreweatts 
auctioneers on Donington Priory, near Newbury, Berkshire.

Eric Knowles, of TV's Antiques 
Roadshow and consultant for Dreweatts, said: 'It is a quite exceptional 
collection that covers everything from textiles and furniture to works 
of art.

'It is rare to have 
the opportunity to handle an important collection which is a mixture of 
all the major disciplines that illustrate the excellence of design and 
craftsmanship, which was the essential pre-requisite demanded by the 
ethos of the Arts and Crafts movement.

'The
wall hanging in silk by Jane Morris is just so beautiful. If I owned it
I probably would have to look at it every morning before starting my 
day.'

Knowles added: 'The four drawings by 
Philip Webb of a hare, a fox, a raven and a lion that were for the 
William Morris Forest Tapestry are exquisite.

'In 36 years I don't recall having access to anything quite as important as this collection.

'The
provenance is par excellence. It has been in the same family since it 
was commissioned or bought by Lawrence W Hodson and hasn't been 
collected over the years.'

Away from William Morris' work, there is an ornate gilded convex, hexagonal wall mirror designed by Joseph Southall in 1899 and estimated to sell for £6,000.

A 'grotesque' stoneware bird jar by the Martin brothers made in 1905 is tipped to sell for 8,000 pounds.

The Arts and Craft Movement spanned from 1860 to 1910 and was a reaction to the industrial revolution and stood for traditional, handmade craftsmanship.

The auction takes place on February 27.
