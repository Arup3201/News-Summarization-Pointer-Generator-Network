This is the moment a prisoner calmly walked out of his jail cell and past security guards in a prison lobby after impersonating his brother in a cunning daylight escape.

When the prison guard notices something is amiss, convict William Hewett sheds his coat and sprints off towards the trees in the distance, with the portly guard left trailing in his wake.

Hewett, who was being held at the Brunswick County Detention Centre in North Carolina when he escaped, spent four days on the run before eventually being recaptured.

Sheriff John Ingram said Hewett escaped last Thursday about 4pm after he and his brother Curtis switched armbands while being held in the same cell.

Hewett impersonated his brother - who was being held on an assault charge - when Curtis was bonded out of jail, according to WECT.

His brother now faces charges for his role in the plan, while a jailer at the detention centre was reportedly sacked.

Mr Ingram said security procedures at the detention centre were not followed correctly, which aided Hewett's escape.

He told WECT: 'Obviously they did not follow protocol, we can only put but just so many steps in place,

'If you simply followed protocol and you look at the photos attached to every single thing to include their property when they are checked in, you would know that is not the right person you are letting out.'

However, Hewett's time as a free man remained brief when he was recaptured four days later, alongside a host of family members alleged to have helped hide him from the authorities during his time as a fugitive.

He was later pictured in court in full body restraints to prevent spitting.

In a statement, the Brunswick County Sheriff's office said he was found in a camper shell on the property of his family's Trails End compound and taken into custody without incident.

In addition to his previous charges, he was also charged with escaping from a county or municipal facility, burning personal property, and injury to personal property, both stemming from an incident on December 18 last year.

He was taken back to Brunswick County Detention Facility and held under a $3,000,000 bond.

Other people charged include his mother Katherine Hewett Carter, 43; cousin Robert Wayne Hewett, 20; step-father Earl Antonia Carter, 39; girlfriend Caitlin Olivia Moyer, 23; aunt Tanna Lynn Hewett, 36; and family friend Audrey Muncey Thompson, 36.

All were facing counts of felony harboring an escapee, among other charges.
