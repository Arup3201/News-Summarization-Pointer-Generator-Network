Rants: Recordings of Jimmy Lee Dykes talking to FBI negotiators have been released

The demands of a crazed gunman who took a five-year-old boy hostage for six days in an Alabama bunker have been heard for the first time, in newly released recordings.

In a recording taken from a surveillance tape on the school bus that Jimmy Lee Dykes held up, he can be heard demanding to be given two children.

Charles Poland, the driver, bravely refuses to hand over the children, telling Dykes: 'It's my responsibility to keep these kids on the bus,' before he is shot dead.

As well as the school bus drama, the recordings, aired exclusively by ABC News on Friday, include conversations between Dykes and FBI agents as he kept five-year-old Ethan Gilman captive, surrounded by weapons and explosives.

Days of tense talks between federal authorities and the 65-year-old included Dykes cursing at negotiators and ranting that his stand with his five-year-old hostage, who has autism, would cause 'chaos' in society and lead to riots, the recordings reveal.

'People are going be standing up to this [expletive] dictatorial, incompetent, self-righteous, bunch of sorry bastards in government,' Dykes said.

Members of an FBI hostage rescue team stormed Dykes's underground bunker near Midland City in February, killing him before he harmed Ethan or detonated an improvised explosive that authorities said was in the 6ft by 8ft shelter.

In interviews with ABC, FBI agents said they raided the bunker after it became apparent that Dykes was handling weapons and an improvised explosive device more often than he had been at the beginning of the standoff.

Dykes apparently planned to have the child detonate the bomb if he was killed, FBI Special Agent Steve Richardson said.

'Jim Dykes relayed to the negotiators, "If anything happens to me, I have told Ethan to pull the trigger",' Mr Richardson said. 'That meant he had told Ethan to detonate the IED, the second IED that was inside the bunker.'

Bravery: Charles Poland, who was shot dead by Dykes, was hailed as a hero for trying to protect the children

Dykes snatched Ethan off a school bus driven by Mr Poland, 66, in January, dragging the child into the bunker after shooting Mr Poland five times in front of the scared children.

The audio recording, taken from a bus surveillance tape, indicated that after Dykes boarded the bus he immediately demanded children.

'I need two boys 6 to 8 years old,' Dykes, who was armed with a handgun, is heard saying angrily in the recording. 'Six to 8 years old. I mean it. Right now! Right now!'

Mr Poland bravely refused, saying: 'I can't do it. Sorry, you're going to have to shoot me.'

'How about I shoot a kid then,' Dykes replied.

Moments after Dykes boarded the bus 15-year-old Tre' Watts called 911, telling the woman who answered there was a man on their bus.

'He's got a gun,' Tre' can be heard saying. 'And he keeps asking for kids.'

The dispatcher asks: 'He's aiming the gun at the bus driver?'

Muffled gun shots and the sound of screaming can then be heard as the dispatcher asks: 'Oh my gosh, what's going on?'

'He just shot Mr. Poland,' Tre' tells her. 'I think Mr. Poland is dead.'

The 66-year-old driver had been shot five times. He was hailed as a hero for protecting more than two dozen children on the bus.

Hideout: Dykes kept Ethan in an underground bunker and spoke to FBI agents through a pipe

After he shot Mr Poland, Dykes grabbed Ethan and headed to the bunker he had constructed.

Once there, he used a phone and a pipe to communicate with authorities. The recordings show he was disdainful of government and taunted negotiators with obscenities.

Agent Richardson said the FBI was not optimistic about the situation, fearing for Ethan's life.

'We thought Ethan was going to die,' he told ABC News. 'Our negotiators, our behavioral science folks, behavioral analysis folks told us the best you can hope for is a murder-suicide.'

Authorities previously said Dykes wanted to make a public statement about his complaints against the government, but never revealed specific topics. The recording indicated he believed he could spark anarchy.

'You know goddamn well what I'd say when I go public,' Dykes said. 'It's going to create chaos. It's going to create riots. ... People are going be standing up to this [expletive] dictatorial, incompetent, self-righteous, bunch of sorry bastards in government.'

Rescue mission: FBI agents stormed the bunker, killing Dykes and saving Ethan six days after the kidnap

FBI behavioral scientist Molly Amman, who helped with the hostage situation, said: 'I was immediately concerned. [Dykes] was angry but intelligent and controlled.'

She added: 'Charles Poland was a friend of his. Maybe his only friend. He very coldly made a promise ... to Mr. Poland: "You will do this or I will kill you". And he killed him.'

Neighbors had said Dykes was known as 'Mean Man' because of his anti-government rants, and for carrying a rifle and a shovel.

His motive is still unclear, although Dykes was due in court the day after the school bus confrontation on a charge of firing a weapon at neighbors.

Agent Sean Van Slyke told ABC News that in a final twist to the hostage situation, Dykes had planned 'to have a female reporter down there with him, and that she would hold his hand while, in fact, he got his final message out to the world and then committed suicide in her presence'.

Fortunately, agents, most of whom have children of their own, were able to storm the bunker, killing Dykes and rescuing Ethan who suffered no physical injury during his time in captivity.
