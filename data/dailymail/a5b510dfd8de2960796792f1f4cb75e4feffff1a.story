Carol and Sir Mark Thatcher both returned to Britain yesterday after learning of their mother’s death while abroad.

Sir Mark was said to be finding it ‘very tough’ since receiving the news.

Both he and his twin sister have been grieving privately overseas but have returned to London as the family gathers ahead of next Wednesday’s funeral.

Sir Mark was on holiday at a rented multi-million-pound villa in Barbados when he was informed.

The five-bedroom property overlooks the Caribbean Sea and is on the fringes of the exclusive Sandy Lane estate on the island’s scenic West Coast.

He and his wife, Sarah Jane Russell, packed up and left early yesterday morning to fly to London.

A member of staff at the villa told the Daily Mail: ‘He is only as good as can be expected under the circumstances. It is very tough for him.

‘He has gone away now. He left very early and he was gone by the time we got to work. His wife went with him.’

Carol Thatcher lives in Klosters, the upmarket ski resort in the Swiss Alps favoured by the Royals.

In 1953 Lady Thatcher was 28 when her twins were born. She had been married for two years and was trying to juggle her new career as a lawyer with her political ambitions

Despite living abroad, the twins made regular trips back to Britain to see their ailing mother, and were often seen accompanying her to lunch on her birthday

She left on Sunday morning – the day before her mother’s stroke – on a pre-planned trip, according to her partner, ski instructor Marco Grass.

A neighbour of their apartment, which has a traditional Swiss wooden balcony with stunning views, said Carol had caught a train at 10am to Zurich.

The neighbour added: ‘Everybody knew about Carol’s famous mother. The news is very sad.’

Carol’s whereabouts since then have been unknown, but she is said to have remained abroad until yesterday when she arrived in London.

The 59-year-old twins have not issued an official statement, and have asked for privacy as they mourn their mother.

The statement released on Monday by Lord Bell to announce the death of the former Prime Minister was issued in the name of her two children.

However, they have not been seen in public since the announcement, and have not chosen to share publicly any personal tributes to Lady Thatcher.

Despite living abroad, the twins made regular trips back to Britain to see their ailing mother, and were often seen accompanying her to lunch on her birthday.

It is unclear on what occasion either twin last saw their mother.

‘They are very private people, they very rarely talk about their feelings,’ said family spokesman Lord Bell.

He confirmed that the twins were planning to attend their mother’s funeral at St Paul’s Cathedral, central London.

In her final days, Baroness Thatcher had a dedicated group of friends who took it in turns to visit her during her recuperation at the Ritz Hotel in Piccadilly.

One of that inner circle, Conor Burns, the MP for Bournemouth West, said yesterday: ‘I saw her very regularly. I used to see her pretty much weekly. I had some very special times with her. I got into the routine of going to see her most Sunday evenings.

‘Her weekends were very quiet. Often I was the only visitor who would come in over the course of that weekend, other than her faithful carers.’

The Thatcher siblings have courted controversy ever since their mother entered 10 Downing Street in 1979.

Lady Thatcher’s son first hit the headlines in 1982, the year of the Falklands War, when he went missing in the Sahara Desert for six days while competing in the Paris-Dakar rally. Carol abandoned Britain after being dropped as a correspondent on BBC1’s One Show for describing a tennis player as a ‘golliwog’ in 2009.

The Thatcher twins have largely stayed out of the public eye since moving abroad.

Sir Mark is believed to have settled in Marbella, Spain, after a period travelling around Europe.

Carol spends most of the year in Klosters, where she likes to swim in the pools of the resort’s luxury hotels.
