As a newly appointed chief constable, Dave Jones could be forgiven for not wishing to chase suspected criminals around town centre streets in the early hours of the morning.

But within hours of working his first shift as the top policeman in north Yorkshire, that is exactly what he did.

The new chief constable of North Yorkshire Police was visiting Catterick Garrison Police Station as part of a tour of the county, when the force received reports of a man being assaulted.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Mucking in: The new chief constable of North Yorkshire Police, Dave Jones, was just hours into his first shift when he ended up joining his officers in chasing a suspected criminal through a town centre streets

On foot: The man, suspected of carrying out an assault, is pictured running through Richmond town centre with Mr Jones and his officers chasing behind

Foolish: The suspect thinks he is being clever by hiding in this alleyway, but he did not realise his every move was being monitored by CCTV operators

Mr Jones decided to 'muck in' and join his officers in Richmond town centre at about 12.50am on Monday.

As this CCTV footage shows, one of the suspects ran off, with police officers - including Mr Jones - following swiftly behind. 

Unfortunately for the suspect, his every move was being monitored by CCTV operators who directed the police to his location.

During a search the suspect was spotted down an alleyway climbing over a wall. 

Found: Mr Jones and his officers are easily directed to the alleyway where they begin the hunt for the man

Held: Just hours into his first shift as the chief constable, Mr Jones helps to detain the man and bring about a successful arrest

Happy: Chief Constable Dave Jones, pictured centre, said it was 'great to get involved' and be with his officers on the front line

Mr Jones went after him with another officer who arrested him on suspicion of affray.

Mr Jones said: 'It was important for me to get out and see the officers on the ground and good to be able to muck in with them so soon into my first shift.

'It was great to get involved, and good to be out there with them on the front line.

'Fortunately, the rest of my first shift was a bit quieter and I was able to get around the rest of the county and meet some of the officers and our partners who help to make North Yorkshire one of the safest places in the country.'

Three men in their 20s were arrested by officers and have been released on police bail pending enquiries. The victim of the alleged assault suffered minor injuries and did not require hospital treatment.
