Introducing Tinderella, the anonymous British writer who, after moving to New York, decided to set up her own dating blog chronicling her dating escapades in the Big Apple.

Little did she know however that her blog – which she started to keep her friends at home in London updated with her love life – would become an internet hit with women emailing her nonstop for dating advice.

‘When I moved to New York, my London friends were a bit panicky that there would be no dating disasters to point and laugh at on a regular basis,’ she said, 'So I set up the blog.'

Tinderella is looking for the one in the Big Apple, she says that she hopes to find her Prince Charming on the dating app. Tinder users (left) can swipe left for those they don't fancy and right for those they do

‘Tinder was never part of the plan, I’d actually never heard of it until my second night in New York. I decided to download it and became completely hooked. Now Tinderella has become much bigger than it was ever intended to be!’

But teh 20something she says that even though her close friends and family know about it, she plans to remain anonymous, ‘To avoid potential murder from some of the more unhinged dates that I have written about…

Tinderella continued, ‘One of my dates – who I named Worst Person on Tinder - turned out to be a jui-jitsuer and I now carry a small amount of fear wherever I go that he might be around the corner with a karate chop for my head.’

Tinder is a dating app that first became popular in 2013. The app allows you to scroll through a large number of profiles swiping right for people you like the look of and left for those you don’t.

Tinderella blogs about her dating experiences. She uses a rating system and describes her dates clothing, however, she does not use their real names instead giving them code Tinder names

Luckily for Tinderella she says that so far only one match has worked out who she is (and he probably shouldn’t have been messaging her in the first place).

‘I received a text from a man I call Married Tinder [because he’s married] saying, ‘You wrote about me’, which was a little terrifying. I’d rather hoped we might never speak again.

‘Apparently someone that he matched with on Tinder sent him the link to the blog asking if it was him. Luckily, since he was married and lying about it, I figured I still maintained the moral high-ground…’

Tinderella says some dates are worse that others. She's even met a married man on the app who discovered her true identity (posed by models)

Tinderella explains that when she first downloaded Tinder the excitement and novelty of it led her to go on three or four dates a week.

But now she’s chooses a little more carefully, ‘I’ve accepted that my soulmate probably isn’t in a strip bar, or in Brooklyn, so I’m a lot more picky with who I date.

And she’s still hopeful that she will meet ‘the one’ on the dating app. She said, ‘It would be lovely to tell my grandchildren that my husband and I met on the moorlands when he rescued me on horseback from a vicious storm, but as I don’t frequent moorlands I’m grateful for Tinder.

‘I hear of Tinder romances and engagements all the time, so I’m very hopeful that my 6’2”, gorgeous, kind, witty writer is going to appear on Tinder any day now.

But for now she says that writing about bad dates makes up for having to go on them, ‘The worst date I ever had was with Worst Person on Tinder and I wrote about it immediately.

‘Writing about a bad date is fun, and is the only retribution for having been present at said bad date.

‘It’s a lot harder to write about heartbreak… I don’t want the blog to turn into a mopey pity party, so I needed a little distance before I was able to write about Boston Tinder.

And as for Tinderella’s future plans she revealed, ‘I’d love to turn the blog into a fictional book one day.

'Right now I am currently working on a feminist’s guide to online dating which has been borne out of the many emails that I receive from readers asking for dating advice, and the hours I put in with friends to help them with their tinder profiles.'

She added, 'I seem to be pretty good at helping others with their dating lives… now I just need to find someone who will fix mine! The thought of telling my perfect match about the blog though fills me with absolute dread.'
