Police say that they are '80 per cent sure' that Noah did not fall into a nearby pond, according to WSLS.

However, authorities are debating draining the body of water.

His mother, who called police at 11am after searching for her child, said that the boy was a cautious child and had no history of running away.

Noah's parents were scheduled to make a statement on Monday afternoon, but their statement was delayed. 

Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to contact the Pulaski Sheriff's Office at 540-980-7800 or the Virginia State Police 1-800-822-4453 

More than 100 people in the rural Virginia town signed up to search for the boy on Monday. 

They plan to continue searching for the boy round-the-clock.

Billy Chrimes, deputy search and rescue coordinator with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, said that the best opportunity to find a missing child is often at night when they stop moving. 

Lack of food and water and potential problems with wildlife are also concerns, he told the Roanoke Times.

Temperatures on Monday night were in the mid-40s.
