The wet and wild conditions that have caused havoc in parts of Britain are expected to continue this week as the country is blighted by another severe weather system.

After thousands were left without power in the North last week following hurricane-force gusts, a series of storms will stir up more bitterly cold winds.

Temperatures will plummet across the country, and there is a chance of snow, hail and thunder in many areas.

Heavy rain is also expected to cause a flooding risk in the coming days.

Engineers are hoping to restore power to 12,700 people in Scotland still without power after twin Atlantic storms damaged buildings, power lines and brought snow and ice at the weekend, causing travel chaos and cutting power to around 100,000 homes in northern Scotland 

The Met Office has issued several yellow ‘be prepared’ warnings for huge swathes of the country today, warning of rain, snow and strong winds.

Higher areas in the North were blanketed in their first snowfall of the year yesterday morning, with more widespread snowfall likely in coming days.

Gusts could reach speeds of up 80mph today in northern areas, causing traffic disruption as another area of low pressure descends on the UK.

Last week’s fierce winds, caused by a powerful 250mph jetstream moving from the US over Scotland, left more than 100,000 people without power, damaged buildings and led to multiple road closures.

Those in Scotland, the North-East, North-West and Yorkshire have been told to expect no let-up in the battering winds today, while heavy rain is expected in the South-East. The Environment Agency has issued 15 flood warnings across the country.

Temperatures are also likely to plummet tomorrow, worsened by the chilly wind, and snow is expected in the Lake District, Snowdonia, the Pennines and Scotland.

Wintry showers will continue throughout the country on Wednesday, with northern and western areas more likely to see snowfall.

A further area of low pressure will cause the ‘most disturbed conditions’ of the week on Wednesday afternoon before the storms finally subside.

Yesterday the weather caused disruption to a number of train and ferry services, while a fallen tree on a power line left around 1,000 homes in Crowborough, East Sussex, without power.

Met Office forecaster Calum MacColl said that ‘virtually no part of the country’ would escape bad weather this week.

He added: ‘It will be a very disturbed period. The worst of it will be late Wednesday and early Thursday until it (the low pressure) clears off into the North Sea.’
