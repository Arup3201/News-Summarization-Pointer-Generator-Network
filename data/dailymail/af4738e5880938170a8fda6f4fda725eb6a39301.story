The first word their child speaks is a moment all parents remember.

But for Steph Ward, it was a particularly emotional - because it meant her son had survived gruelling surgery.

Four-year-old Lyall woke up from the operation and uttered his word ever word - "mummy”.

Brave: Lyall Cookward, 4, couldn't speak before surgery to reconstruct his windpipe. When he came round from the operation, his first word was 'mummy'

Lyall, who has Down’s Syndrome, suffered heart failure soon after birth and needed a risky operation - but was then diagnosed with a rare lung condition and spent six months in intensive care.

He was expected to be on a ventilator long-term for life. But the youngster instead came off the machine, although he still relied on a tracheostomy opening his windpipe to help him breathe.

This is a surgical procedure to create an opening in the neck at the front of the windpipe (trachea) - but it made it virtually impossible for Lyall to to speak.

Although his airway had collapsed, Lyall’s surgeon suggested out he could carry out a full reconstruction.

This involved grafting a piece of cartilage from Lyall’s rib onto his airway to strengthen it.

Ms Ward and her partner Sharron Cook, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, agonised about whether he should have the risky surgery.

Struggle: Before the surgery, it was expected that Lyall would be on a ventilator for life. But the youngster instead came off the machine, although he still relied on a tracheostomy opening his windpipe to help him breathe. Following surgery, he no longer needs this either

Ms Ward, a full-time mother, said: 'It was such a hard decision to make. Lyall was happy with his tracheostomy. He didn't seem to mind it at all.

'All the other operations he's had have been life-or-death, this one had to be our choice.

'Then we had to take into consideration the risks - the fact that the operation was taking place just milimetres away from his vocal chords, so we could lose what chance we had of hearing him speak.

'Also the operation could cause damage and affected his chance of eating properly.

'But we really wanted him to be free of the tubes and give him the chance to speak properly, to be able to communicate with his friends and play with them.

'Before, he wasn't able to get mucky like any other little boy because the tubes had to be kept clean.'

The pair eventually decided to go ahead and he underwent the operation at Leeds General Infirmary last month. Thankfully, the surgery was successful.

Ms Ward, 46, said: 'It’s amazing. When they told us he was now breathing, we just didn’t know what to say.'

Happy: Lyall with his parents, Steph Ward and Sharron Cook. Ms Ward said: 'Hearing his first word was such an emotional moment. It was the perfect first word for him to say - and hearing it was amazing'

Throughout his short life, Lyall has defied expert opinion as he has battled various serious health conditions.

After the operation he had to be sedated in intensive care for several days to allow the graft to heal.

She added: 'Lyall had the operation on March 13 and was sedated for three days to stop him from pulling on the tubes and allow the wound to heal.

Then he got a chest infection and they had to keep him sedated for up to a week in total.

'Waiting three or four days for him to wake up was long enough, but it was hell waiting for a week to see how he was and if we'd made the right decision.

When surgeons were eventually were able to bring him round, he began breathing for himself.

'The first thing he said when he woke up was "mummy", really clearly, said Ms Cook. 'There were a lot of tears.

Enjoyment: Now Lyall can form many words and sounds he couldn't before, is giggling and shouting, and enjoying the freedom he has never had

'It was such an emotional moment. It was the perfect first word for him to say really, hearing it was just amazing.'

While in hospital, medical staff from throughout his life saw him and many became very emotional by his progress - which his mothers said was very touching.

One told us: 'It's more than was ever imaginable,' said Ms Ward.

'It took about three weeks for him to get back to himself - now he's running around, shouting, back to his boisterous self.'

Now Lyall can form many words and sounds he couldn’t before, is giggling and shouting, and enjoying the freedom he has never had.

Ms Ward said: 'He can be more free. He can be upstairs playing with his friends or brothers while we are downstairs. We’ve never been able to do that before - and that’s massive.

'He started school full-time in September so we definitely made the right decision and did it at the right time.'

His family said they were 'indebted' to surgeons for all they have done for Lyall - and have now set up a fundraising drive to help other children like him.

They want to buy resources for the wards which use Makaton, a simple sign language which Lyall uses, so they can better communicate with young patients.

And they hope to enable frontline staff to learn a few basic signs which could make hospital less stressful for youngsters.

'We want to make a difference for kids like him who are coming through - it would be great,' said Ms Cook.

Lyall will take part in the Jane Tomlinson Appeal Mini Run on May 11, while his fifth birthday will be celebrated by a fundraising party on June 6 with an appearance from signing group singing hands.
