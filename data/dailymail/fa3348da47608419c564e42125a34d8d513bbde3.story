A 92-year-old war veteran had his medals stolen on the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, police said today.

11 medals were taken from the veteran's home in Whetstone, north London, on Friday morning as thousands gathered in Normandy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings.

A man claiming to represent a water company knocked on the unnamed pensioner's door and said he needed to check the water pressure, Scotland Yard said.

He was allowed in and appeared to look at the taps in the kitchen before leaving a short while later.

That evening the victim noticed items in his bedroom had been disturbed.

He also found 11 war and service medals had been stolen.

Nothing else is believed to have been taken and no arrests have been made, police said.

The man who entered the house is described as white, about 5ft 10in and of stocky build.

He spoke with an Irish accent and wore grey clothing which was similar to an engineer's outfit.

The veteran served with the Grenadier Guards during the Second World War, mainly in Italy and North Africa.

Officers from the Burglary Squad, based at Colindale Police Station, are investigating.

Police in Barnet, north London, said officers were also looking in to the crime.

A spokesman said: 'The victim was at his home in the Whetstone area at approximately 9.25am on Friday when a man, claiming to represent a water company, knocked on his door.

The theft took place on Friday morning, as thousands of veterans and world leaders gathered on the beach of Ouistreham, Normandy, pictured, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the landings
