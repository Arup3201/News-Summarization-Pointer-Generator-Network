Clutching my tiny two week old son to my somewhat frazzled body I let my mother into a secret.

‘To be honest, he hasn't left the house yet,’ I whispered, revealing that two week old Archie was as cosseted as a young prince.

Not only was I exhausted, but I was terrified of venturing outside in case we forgot some vital piece of equipment. What if I found myself in an embarrassing explosive nappy changing emergency? What if he got hungry and I had nowhere and nothing to feed him?

The reality, to put this into perspective, was that we lived in Central London, never further than 100 metres from a supermarket and I was breast feeding so frankly, all would be fine. Plus we had a top of the range Bugaboo pushchair for for safe and easy travel.

Scroll down for video

Any crisis could be resolved by leaping into a black cab and hot-footing it back to Fulham. 

But no modern day high tech equipment would have ever made me want to hit the beach two weeks post birth. I can't think of anything worse. I could barely get ready for bed, never mind anything else.

Mum of three Alice Smellie says she can imagine nothing worse than going on a beach holiday two weeks after giving birth

So, as you can imagine, I was astonished to see young Eric Cowell’s launch into society taking place on a balmy beach just ten days after his birth.

I would rather have travelled on the first manned flight to Mars than take a newborn to a sand-infested boiling hot beach.

Let me tell you about tiny babies and beaches.

Firstly - and I realise that this is obvious, but it appears that Eric’s parents may have forgotten - beaches are full of that irritating stuff known as sand.

Get that into a nappy and you are potentially looking at nappy rash and therefore an unhappy and wide-awake baby who requires a nappy change.

It goes without saying that changing a nappy on a beach is inevitably going to involve, yes you guessed it, more sand. We all know it gets everyhwhere so you can forget any thoughts of cleaning that baby's bum properly because wipes are sand magnets.

The slightest breeze - and by this I mean the sort of breeze that might lightly flutter the hem of Lauren’s kaftan - will have sand sticking to the baby wipe, and thus to the bottom of young Cowell.

Alice Smellie says that most normal mothers wouldn't be able to carry all the equipment needed for the beach

Next, there is the kit.

Breast
 feeding or not, new babies need approximately twelve suitcases of 
baggage - nappies changes of clothes, toys (no new parent, myself 
included, has even acknowledged that the two day old is not going to 
appreciate teddy bears, even if they come from Harrods). So it isn’t 
surprising that Simon and Lauren need what looks like five or six nannies.

'It goes without saying that changing a 
nappy on a beach is inevitably going to involve some sort of sand/baby 
wipe interaction. Baby wipes have their uses, but they also act as sand 
magnets'

As Lauren Silverman appears not to be breast-feeding, she will need about ten sterilised bottles. Minimum. And should one touch anything a bit dirty (e.g. a dog's tongue!) it will be totally redundant.

Finally, but most importantly, there is the Florida sun, which is presumably both hot and powerful.

Although the newborn has mostly been photographed under an assortment of white billowing tents, it seems extraordinary that they wouldn’t just keep him inside and away from any risk of over-heating or sunstroke.

Lauren Silverman avoids giving her baby dreaded sunstroke by sheltering in a large white tent

We didn’t take baby Archie to a beach until he was eight months old. I remember the special sun-tent, the twenty sorts of hypo-allergenic sun cream, the baby food spilling in the bottom of the Cath Kidston rucksack and the hissed and irritable mewling which accompanies all normal babies in transit.

I can't help thinking, looking at all the photos that Lauren Silverman isn't always enjoying herself at the beach with her baby. She looks - as a friend of mine has pointed out - a bit cross. I think this might be like calling Cowell a ‘bit rich.’

In a couple of the pictures her lips look pursed as though she wants to tell someone to just leave her alone.

Simon Cowell was seen with an entourage of young female fans on baby Eric's first outing to the beach

Alice Smellie says that most new mothers don't want to be seen in public for a while after birth - especially if their partners are surrounded by young female fans eager to flirt

Most new mothers don’t want to be seen in public for at least a week. Frankly, I think she must have the patience of a saint to be trekking on hot sand clutching a days old baby in on-trend beachwear.

One is at this point - to be delicate about the situation - recovering physically from the trauma of giving birth. So a short kaftan is beyond impractical.

Generally, even if you have maintained your pre-pregnancy figure as amazingly as Silverman, you feel a bit fat. A baby has just emerged from your tummy and it inevitably takes at least a few weeks to lose the extra pounds. 

Alice says that recently giving birth and a short kaftan don't go hand in hand

So the last thing you want is to be seen half-naked (by everybody in the developed world), especially as your partner is being heavily flirted with by any number of toned hotties with good plastic surgery and small bikinis.

Most women during that first week get a bit weepy as the body undergoes extreme hormonal changes. Again - taking the infant onto a beach with fifty staff and close friends is the last thing you feel like doing.

You want to be slumped in a chair with day-time telly, comfy pyjamas and your husband and relatives dancing close attendance. (This is what I did with every one of my three babies).

Most mothers might burst into tears, shove the baby at Cowell screaming, ‘he’s your responsibility too,’ and storm off back to the five star hotel.

And most fathers would probably take it on the chin.

I watch with interest…..
