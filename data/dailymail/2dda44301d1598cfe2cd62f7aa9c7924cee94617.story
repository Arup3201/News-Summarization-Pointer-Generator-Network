Sitting in traffic is not only a nuisance, it raises stress levels, causes us to breathe in harmful smog and makes us late for work.

And, according to a new survey, the problem is only getting worse with almost every one of America's most clogged cities having more traffic in 2013 compared with 2012.

It is perhaps no surprise to find that Los Angeles is still the most congested city in the U.S. For every hour travelled during rush hour, a whopping 39 minutes will be spent in traffic.

Los Angeles is the most congested city in the U.S. for the second year running. Drivers who commute half and hour every morning can expect to spend 90 hours in traffic every year

Vancouver (left) has remained the second most congested city for two years in a row, while San Fransisco (right) has jumped from sixth to third

That means commuters who travel half an hour to work every day will spend 90 hours, almost four whole days, stuck in a jam every year.

According to the survey of TomTom users, 
Vancouver takes second spot for the second year in a row, with journey 
times there on average 35 per cent longer during rush hour, 5 per cent 
worse than last year.

Kansas City has the fewest traffic delays in America, with just 12 minutes of every rush hour spend sitting in delays.

Drivers commuting half an hour every day will spend 38 hours every year in a jam, compared with 90 hours in LA, the worst city.

According to the poll, Friday morning and Monday evening are the best days to drive in the city, while motorists should avoid Tuesday morning and Thursday evening, as they have the worst traffic.

San Fransisco is up to number three in the table, with journey times in peak hours getting seven per cent longer than last year, with 34 minutes out of every hour spent in queues.

Honolulu is
 a new entry at number four in the table, having not featured in last 
year's survey, knocking Seattle down into fifth, despite the fact that 
the city's traffic delays also got worse.

Of the top ten worst cities for traffic, eight of them had longer queues in 2013 compared with 2012, with two of them not featuring in the previous survey.

Out of the top 20, only three saw time spent in jams reduced, with citizens of Miami, Tampa and Houston able to catch a few more minutes in bed before their journey to work.

Honolulu, Hawaii, is a new entry into the table at number four, having not featured last year. Commuters here can expect rush hour journeys to be 29 per cent longer than usual

The arrival of Honolulu has knocked Seattle from fourth to fifth place, despite the fact that delays got worse between 2012 and 2013

The best city to drive in the U.S. is Kansas City, with just 12 minutes out of every hour spent sitting in traffic in the mornings and evenings, with Indianapolis coming a close second.

Overall Friday mornings were the best day for travelling into work, with many commuters deciding to work from home instead of jumping in the car, while Monday evenings were the best for coming home again.

According to the poll, which is based on real-time information from TomTom devices, Tuesday morning and Thursday evenings should be avoided at all costs, as these were the worst days for traffic.

*Delay from congestion is the time added to journeys during peak times. So a journey in LA during rush hour will be 36 per cent longer than when there is no traffic
