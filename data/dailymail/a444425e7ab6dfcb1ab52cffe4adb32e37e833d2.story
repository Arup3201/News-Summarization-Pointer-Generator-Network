Swift justice: Nicolas Sarkozy instantly expelled two radical Islamists from France

Two radical Islamists were kicked out of France yesterday – prompting calls for Theresa May to take the same no-nonsense approach when it comes to removing extremists.

Nicolas Sarkozy demanded the deportation of a convicted  terrorist and a hate preacher.

No sooner had the expulsion order been signed than the pair were put on flights out of the country.

The swift departures led to  
comparisons with Britain’s embarrassingly flawed efforts to remove hate 
preacher Abu Qatada who is wanted in Jordan on terror charges.

He is out on bail after the European 
Court of Human Rights blocked his deportation on the grounds that Qatada
 would not face a fair trial if returned.

Home Secretary Mrs May has insisted 
she wants to secure an agreement with Jordan which would satisfy the 
Strasbourg court and allow Qatada to be removed from Britain.

Despite 
this however, officials insist any attempt to remove him in breach of 
the court’s ruling would be met with a court injunction by his lawyers.

French law allows swift removal of 
foreigners, with around 20,000 non-EU nationals being expelled every 
year. Unlike in Britain, where cases can drag on for years, rights of 
appeal are strictly curtailed.

In this country, ministers wait until 
 a subject’s legal options are  exhausted before removing them from the 
country. This can include a lengthy appeal to the European Court of 
Human Rights.

But in France, Italy and other 
European countries, terror suspects have been removed even if legal 
proceedings are still going on, or even in breach of a Strasbourg 
ruling.

Mr Sarkozy, who is behind in the polls
 going into this month’s  Presidential election, said: ‘Those who make 
remarks contrary to the values of the Republic will be put outside the 
French Republic. There will be no exceptions.’

Almany Baradji, an imam, was sent back
 to Mali for ‘preaching anti-Semitism’ and calling on women to wear the 
full veil, which is illegal in France.

Ali Belhadad, an Algerian convicted 
for his role in a 1994 terror attack in Marrakesh that killed 14 people,
 was flown to Algiers after the authorities discovered he had resumed 
contact with Islamic activists. Another man, Saad Nasser Alshastry, a 
Saudi imam, was barred from returning to France.

Last night Tory MP for Shipley Philip Davies said: ‘It would be nice if we adopted the same approach in this country.

‘I’m sure this isn’t disconnected to 
the forthcoming presidential elections in France. This is what irritates
 the public about politicians – they take these actions before the 
election and once voting ends, normal service resumes.

‘I think the British public want to see these people deported.’

The row comes ahead of a key ruling by the Strasbourg court over the extradition of hook-handed extremist Abu Hamza.

He is wanted for terror offences in 
the U.S. but has argued that sending him for trial would breach his 
human rights. A decision on his case and that of five other terror 
suspects will be delivered next Tuesday. Douglas Carswell, MP for 
Clacton, added: ‘The fact seems to be that we can throw out Abu Qatada 
and others like him if we want to. It’s just a question of will in 
Whitehall.’

On Monday a senior judge expressed his
 astonishment that an Algerian terrorist who was thrown out of France is
 now living in Britain.

The 49-year-old was convicted of a 
1992 airport bomb attack in his country. He lived in France where he was
 jailed for membership of a terrorist group and ordered to be deported.

In 2001 he came to Britain and since then has been fighting to claim asylum in the UK. The Court of Appeal ruled in his favour.

The crackdown in France follows the 
killings of seven people last month by Al Qaeda-inspired gunman Mohamed 
Merah. The victims included three Jewish schoolchildren.
