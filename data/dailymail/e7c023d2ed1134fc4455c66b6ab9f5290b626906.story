A bronze statue of multi-millionaire heiress Carla Bruni-Sarkozy dressed up as a 'worker' has caused outrage after being placed in the centre of a Paris suburb.

The bizarre work of art has been 'camouflaged' since it was delivered to Nogent-sur-Marne at around 6am on Tuesday morning.

It was originally intended to celebrate the career of a former supermodel-turned-pop singer who became France's first lady after marrying French President Nicolas Sarkozy's in 2008.

But since Mr Sarkozy's election defeat in May, the couple have been mired in deep controversy.

They
disappeared from their Paris home a month ago, the night before 
anti-corruption police raided the mansion, together with two offices 
linked to Mr Sarkozy.

He is 
suspected of accepting illegal cash payments from Lilian Bettencourt, 
the L'Oreal heiress and France's richest woman, in return for tax 
breaks.

Uncanny: The 90,000 euro (£75,000) statue portrays the Italian-born Ms Bruni-Sarkozy as a 'plumassiere' - a woman worker from one of Nogent's former feather factories

With neither Mr 
Sarkozy nor Ms Bruni-Sarkozy seen nor heard from for weeks, local 
council officials in Nogent have admitted to being 'deeply embarrassed' 
by the statue.

'It has not 
only been described as hideous, but it honours a very rich woman whose 
husband is facing corruption allegations,' said one. 'It's well 
camouflaged at the moment, and not many people have noticed it, but the 
official unveiling is going to be difficult.'

Winched into place: One socialist politician said it was 'an insult to the Italian feather workers'

But today it was covered in masking tape and hidden from public view as the row about it rumbled on.

William Geib, a local Socialist politician, said portraying Ms Bruni-Sarkozy as a working woman was 'grotesque'.

He said: 'It's an insult to the Italian feather workers, to give them the face of an extremely rich person. I have nothing against Carla Bruni-Sarkozy but she does not represent workers.'

Even Ms Bruni-Sarkozy's own staff had questioned the significance of the statue when she was first lady, with a spokeswoman saying: 'Carla isn't Joan of Arc or General de Gaulle. Carla is a former model.'

Beginning to sweat: Ms Bruni and husband Nicolas Sarkozi disappeared from their Paris home a month ago, the night before anti-corruption police raided the mansion, together with two offices linked to the former president

Despite this, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy admitted to modeling for the statue's sculptor, Elisabeth Cibot.

Now an inauguration of the statue has been penciled in for September 21st, but neither Ms Bruni-Sarkozy nor her controversial husband will be in Nogent.

'She was not invited and will not be present,' said Jacques Martin, the mayor of Nogent and a member of Mr Sarkozy's UMP party.

Money for the statue was originally set to come from taxpayers, but Cogedim, a local building company, are now thought to have covered the cost.

The Sarkozy family, including the couple's baby daughter Giulia, are thought to have headed to Canada before the police raids in June.

Their lawyers claimed they would be back within two weeks, but more than a month later they are still away, and thought to be staying with wealthy friends.
