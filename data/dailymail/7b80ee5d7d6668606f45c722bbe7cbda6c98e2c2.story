Northampton staged their second Friday-night fightback in a week as Stephen Myler’s supreme goal-kicking in Cardiff swept them to the Amlin Challenge Cup title and part one of their Double target.

Seven days after rallying from a 17-6 deficit to finally trump Leicester and earn a place in the Aviva Premiership Final, the Saints fought their way out of another tight corner to claim European glory.

Just after half-time, Jim Mallinder’s side were 13-6 adrift, down to 14 men and Bath had a routine shot at goal.

Cup run: Northampton captain Tom Wood and Phil Dowson hold the Amlin Challenge Cup aloft

On target: Stephen Myler kicked impressively for Northampton in their 30-16 Cup final win

Opportunity lost: Bath couldn't capitalise on their periods in control and the Saints' class overcame them

The Saints were staring into the 
abyss, but they turned the tide as Myler claimed a 20-point personal 
haul with six penalties and a conversion, and late tries by Phil Dowson 
and Ben Foden sealed the comeback.

There
 were some grim sights for watching England head coach Stuart Lancaster.
 Bath’s electric wing, Anthony Watson, hobbled off with a suspected 
hamstring strain and his team-mate, prop David Wilson, was removed after
 being treated for what appeared to be pain in his shoulder.

The
 Saints’ challenge was founded on a dominant scrum, with Alex Corbisiero
 making his presence felt before being yellow-carded for illegally 
charging into a ruck after the ball was out. But before their 
second-half decline, Bath capitalised on Springbok flanker Francois 
Louw’s ability to wreak regular havoc at the breakdown.

Almost wasted: Luther Burrell crossed the line but Northampton needed Ben Foden's input to score the try

Watson
 struck from 60 metres out in the first half when ruck pressure created a
 turnover, but once the pendulum had swung Northampton’s way and Myler’s
 right boot edged his team ahead, the Saints crossed the line twice late
 on.

Dowson scored from a lineout catch and drive, before Foden applied 
the crucial touch after a midfield break-away almost came to nothing.

‘It’s
 been hugely frustrating in the last four years to go so close to 
winning titles and not quite getting over the line, so it is great to 
finally get winners medals,’ said Northampton captain Tom Wood. ‘We want
 to go on and get that Double now.’

Mallinder
 added: ‘This sets us up perfectly for a massive challenge in the 
Premiership Final and we’ve got a good chance. Saracens are a great team
 but we’ ll look forward to watching them play tomorrow and hopefully 
Toulon will get stuck into them!’

Arms up: Bath and Northampton contest a line-out at Cardiff Arms Park

Dominant: Myler controlled the game after the break as the Saints overpowered Bath

Referee
 Jerome Garces awarded Bath a penalty that Ford missed, but he opted not
 to award a yellow card that England flanker Wood's indiscretion 
warranted.

Northampton did 
not learn their lesson, though, and three minutes after the break 
Corbisiero was sin-binned for tackling Bath captain Stuart Hooper off 
the ball, but Ford again drifted his kick wide.

Myler
 then completed his penalty hat-trick and it was the cue for Bath boss 
Mike Ford to make his first change as scrum-half Peter Stringer replaced
 Micky Young before Ford missed with another shot at goal.

Ford's
 inaccuracy off the kicking tee came as an unexpected bonus for 
Northampton, and it meant they were still in a game that Bath should 
have been on the verge of closing out.

Just reward: Anthony Watson sped away to score a deserved first-half try for Bath

But
 Bath substitute prop Anthony Perenise was yellow-carded 10 minutes from
 time and Northampton made them pay instantly when Dowson was driven 
over from a lineout and Myler's conversion sealed the deal.

A
 Myler interception of Ford's pass then had Bath retreating rapidly in 
defence, and although supporting centre Luther Burrell slipped with the 
line at his mercy, Saints had enough players in support for assist Foden
 and Garces awarded the try on confirmation from television match 
official Eric Gauzins.

Bath 
were finished and it meant they ended a season that promised so much as 
losing Amlin finalists just two weeks after they finished fifth in the 
Premiership and missed out on the play-offs.
