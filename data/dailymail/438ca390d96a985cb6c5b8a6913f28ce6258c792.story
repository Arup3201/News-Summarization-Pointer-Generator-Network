Tony Abbott bragged about spending three months backpacking through India in the 1980s during a recent official visit to the country.

But he probably never imagined his story of adventure would prove to be a source of inspiration for one creative mind.

The Prime Minister is now the star of an hysterical parody video of the film The Darjeeling Limited, courtesy of Melbourne video editor Huw Parkinson.

Mr Parkinson's recreation, titled The Darjeeling Abbotted, took a week to edit together using footage from Mr Abbott's recent two-day visit to India.

The original film, starring Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman, follows three brothers travelling across India as they attempt to bond with each other.

Mr Parkinson decided to superimpose the Prime Minister's face onto Brody's body after hearing of his adventurous journey 30 years ago for 'a bit of fun'.

'It took a week to make... I underestimated the size of  Adrien Brody's head,' he told ninemsn.

'It was just born out of me being a little bit bored and a little bit irritated so it was a good place to vent.

'I secretly like to think Abbott has watched it but he is in Arnhem Land at the moment so I doubt it.'

The parody video has already won the acclaim of online viewers who describe the video as 'perfect', 'sublime' and 'outstanding'.

Mr Parkinson's previous parody credits include inserting billionaire Clive Palmer's infamous 'Chinese mongrels' rant into an Arrested Development scene.

He also included Joe Hockey's controversial comments about 'poor people don't drive' in an episode of True Detective.
