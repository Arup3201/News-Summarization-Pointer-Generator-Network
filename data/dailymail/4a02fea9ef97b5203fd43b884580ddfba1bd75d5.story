This behind-the-scenes look at the Royal Mint shows workers producing three new coins for 2015 to commemorate British anniversaries.

A 50 pence piece - set to enter circulation around March - will mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in 1940.

The new coin created by sculptor Gary Breeze depicts three fighter pilots scrambling for their Spitfires under a sky crowded with bombers.

A new £2 coin will mark the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta  and a second £2 coin will celebrate the Navy’s role in the First World War.

Coinage artist John Berhdahl created the special Magna Carta coins which show King John accepting the historic treaty in 1215.

The other £2 coin was designed by military artist David Rowlands and shows a Royal Navy battleship which contributed to victory in WW1.

The Mint, based in south Wales, said its coin making process is in three stages of making the blanks, making the dies and striking the coins.

It begins when the appropriate metals are melted before being extracted as a continuous strip, then reduced to a coin's thickness.

Blank discs are punched from this, and then an engraving machine cuts the design into steel - used to make the dies to strike the coins.

The blank coins are then fed into a coining press with a pair of dies, which strike the blanks and turn them into 850 coins a minute.

Changing shape: Metal slugs which will be melted down to make new coins at the Royal Mint plant in Wales

Coin blanks: These are punched from the strip in a blanking press at a rate of up to 10,000 a minute

Off they go: The blanks are softened by heating them in an annealing furnace at up to 950C 

Blanks: Three new coins are being produced for 2015 commemorating a trio of landmark events in British history

Pounds and pence: The Royal Mint coin production plant (above) is located less than 15 miles from Cardiff in Mid Glamorgan, south Wales

Modelling: A plaster model of the intended coin is prepared at several times its diameter, once a design has received approval

Careful work: The finished plaster model is scanned by a ruby-tipped probe which saves the design as a digital file

Coin engraver: The Royal Mint is producing a raft of new coins for next year to commemorate British anniversaries

Various shapes and sizes: A coin engraver's tools are laid out on a work bench at the Royal Mint plant in south Wales

Paying close attention: The process of coin production is split into three sections - making the blanks, making the dies and striking the coins

Factory setting: Giant rolls of metal used for making coins in the production facility for the Royal Mint in south Wales

Hard at work: The Royal Mint coin production plant in Wales, where employees have been manufacturing a new set of coins for 2015

The writing's on the roll: Blank discs of metal are punched in a blanking press at a rate of up to 10,000 a minute

All part of the process: The Royal Mint rolls its own metal sheets, cuts the blanks and hand-crafts the dies
