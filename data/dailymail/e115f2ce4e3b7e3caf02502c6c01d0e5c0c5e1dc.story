Reverend Al Sharpton is being paid thousands of dollars to not cry 'racism' at large corporations that are in the spotlight, it has been claimed.

For more than 10 years, firms have reportedly handed over enormous donations and consulting fees to the activist preacher's National Action Network (NAN)

In return for their cash, they have received Sharpton's supposed influence in the black community - or more often, his silence on the matter, it is reported. 

'Al Sharpton has enriched himself and NAN for years by threatening companies with bad publicity if they didn’t come to terms with him,' said Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal & Policy Center, a watchdog group in Virginia that has produced a book on the Harlem minister.

Recently, Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal met with Sharpton after leaked emails in the Sony hack apparently showed her mocking President Obama in a series of racially-charged exchanges.

These exchanges included apparent remarks that the President only likes movies with black actors and subject matter, such as Django Unchained and 12 Years A Slave.

The leak, which also revealed that British actor Idris Elba could be set to play the next James Bond, reportedly left Pascal and her colleagues 'shaking in their boots' and 'afraid of the Rev'.

Pascal subsequently met with Sharpton, the New York Post reported. Although no donations or other payments to NAN have been announced, the pair agreed to form a 'working relationship'.

This relationship aims to focus on racial bias in Hollywood, it is said. 

Experts told the newspaper that the lack of a public assertions of support for Pascal on Sharpton's behalf is exemplary of his typical 'shakedown' move - making people pay for his support or silence.

'Put simply, Sharpton specializes in shakedowns,' said Mr Boehmn.

Another source, who apparently worked alongside Sharpton, added: 'Once Sharpton’s on board, he plays the race card all the way through. He just keeps asking for more and more money.'

However, Sharpton - who has been vocal in the Eric Garner and Michael Brown cases - has denied that his meeting with Pascal was money-oriented in any way. 

In 2008, NAN received a $500,000 donation that was made to New York-based nonprofit Education Reform Now by Plainfield Asset Management, a Connecticut hedge fund.

Although the money was apparently to support NAN's attempts to bring 'educational equality', it was donated at the same time the firm was trying to achieve a lucrative gambling deal in the Big Apple.

Harold Levy, managing director at Plainfield at the time, has denied the contribution was made to win over Sharpton or aid Capital Play's efforts in the Aqueduct Racetrack deal.

Meanwhile, in 2003, Sharpton accused American Honda of not hiring enough African-American managers, saying: 'We cannot be silent while African-Americans spend hard-earned dollars with a company that does not hire, promote or do business with us in a statistically significant manner.'

Shortly after his criticism, the firm's chiefs met with Sharpton and decided to sponsor NAN.

After this, the racially-charged accusations stopped. 

During his 60th birthday party in October, Sharpton raised a staggering $1million for NAN, with donations from unions and an array of corporations, including AT&T and McDonald's.

He has previously received money from the lakes of Macy's, General Motors and Pfizer.
