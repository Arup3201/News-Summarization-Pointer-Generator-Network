A school district has decided to allow senior students to pose with guns in their yearbook photos - as long as the pictures 'don't depict violence towards humanity'.

The school board unanimously voted 6-0 on Monday to allow students, aged 17 and 18, at Broken Bow Public Schools in Nebraska to have firearms and knives after coming under pressure from parents. 

Superintendent Mark Sievering told MailOnline today that the policy was implemented due to the 'climate and culture' of the region but added that the images must be 'respectable, appropriate and tasteful'.

Students, for example, cannot be pointing the gun at the camera in a photograph, in a way which would seem threatening.

There are no restrictions on what types of guns the students are allowed to pose with, according to the newly-adopted policy - but their outfit must adhere to a strict school dress code. 

Guns are still banned from Broken Bow school grounds so the yearbook pictures must either be taken by parents or by a professional photographer. 

Baer Photography, for example, has taken portraits of male and female students posing with their guns. 

In one image, a student poses with his weapon perched over his shoulder alongside a truck; in another, a female student has her gun slung on one shoulder with a set of antlers perched on the other. Another boy has his rifle next to a stag's head while he pets the family dog.

The decision to allow guns in yearbook photos came after the school district found last year that it was a popular concept among students.

The new guidelines state that students are allowed to pose with game they have killed - which is allowed if the animal is dead but not if the creature 'is in obvious distress'.

The school allows students to pose with other props related to their hobbies such as sporting equipment and musical instruments. 

There are bans on clothes which do not apply with school dress code which is deemed as  clothes 'disruptive to the education program'.

Drugs, alcohol and tobacco are, perhaps as expected, strictly banned. 

Mr Sievering said: 'Shooting sports are very popular in the area and we have a number of national champion shooters at the school but we didn't have a policy in place, so we decided to outline it.'

Mr Sievering said after discussing the issue with other school districts, he found mixed opinions on the pictures but that he was not alone in allowing weapon images in the yearbook.

In 2014, school and college shootings in the U.S. has led to 20 deaths and left 42 people injured.

Mr Sievering told MailOnline that he understood that the gun yearbook pictures would be controversial. 

 He said: 'We certainly understand that this is a sensitive topic for many folks. We know that there are many people with very strong opinions on both sides.

'We looked at our community and established a policy that suited our community and decided to allow the pictures, as long as they are not done in a manner that would depict violence towards humanity.

He added: 'We certainly understand that it will have its critics.'

Broken Bow sits in the heart of Custer County and has a population of around 3,500. There are around 3,500 acres of surrounding land available for the hunting of water fowl, ducks, geese and deer.
