Bayern Munich have four men in UEFA's Team of the Year from 2014 as the regular candidates dominate an all-star XI, which includes no British players.

The XI was voted for by 8.6million fans after a year in which Real Madrid claimed the top European club honour.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos make the team, while Angel di Maria, man of the match in the Champions League final victory, is the only man selected who is now plying his trade in the Premier League.

Manuel Neuer kept 19 clean sheets in 32 Bundesliga games in 2014, saving 83 per cent of shots faced. 

Sergio Ramos netted three goals in Real Madrid’s victorious 2013-14 Champions League campaign; no defender got more in the competition.

David Alaba has not been shown a yellow card in any of his last 89 Bundesliga games, including all 24 in 2014.

Diego Godin was part of 18 clean sheets in La Liga in 2014; no player kept more.

Philipp Lahm made 1,042 touches in the Champions League in 2014; only Toni Kroos (1,224) made more.

Angel di Maria made more assists than any other player in the top five European leagues in 2014 (20).

Toni Kroos made more passes than any other player at the 2014 World Cup (544).

Arjen Robben created 17 chances for his side at the World Cup, the most of any Oranje player.

Lionel Messi overtook Raul as the all-time Champions League top scorer

Cristiano Ronaldo has scored in his last 17 home league games (30 goals in total).

Zlatan Ibrahimovic became Sweden's all-time top scorer in September 2014; his brace against Estonia equalled and then broke the record.

Ballon d'Or nominee Manuel Neuer is the man between the sticks after a superb year with Bayern Munich and Germany, and is protected by a strong back four.

Champions League finalists and Madrid rivals Ramos and Diego Godin make up the centre of defence, supported by Bayern full backs Philipp Lahm and David Alaba.

Toni Kroos signed for Real Madrid in the summer but it was his performances with the Bundesliga giants that earned him his place in the XI, as with Di Maria and the Galacticos.

The Argentine signed for Manchester United in a £60m deal last summer, and gets the nod ahead of fellow flying left-footer Gareth Bale.

Arjen Robben had a fine year with Bayern Munich. The Dutch winger is often criticised for his play-acting and attitude, but the 30-year-old is still a frightening prospect for European defenders.

Franck Ribery usually supplements Robben on the left, but in this squad there is only one man who was going to fill that berth; Cristiano Ronaldo.

The Real Madrid and Portugal star scored 61 goals for club and country, including a penalty in the victory in Lisbon against Atletico.

He is of course joined by La Liga, and indeed Ballon d'Or rival Lionel Messi, who broke record after record despite Barcelona failing to hit top form in 2014.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic leads the line after the maverick Swedish striker fired PSG to their second Ligue 1 title, scoring several spectacular goals along the way.

Toni Kroos has since moved to Real Madrid, but his performances for Bayern Munich were praised in 2014

Barcelona struggled but Lionel Messi is still one of the best in the world and he proved it last year

Zlatan Ibrahimovic is PSG's leader on the pitch and still possesses the ability to perform the spectacular
