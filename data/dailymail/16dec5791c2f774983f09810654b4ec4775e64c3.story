It is perhaps the most bizarre vote of confidence a manager has ever received — the football club owner standing outside of a London pub joking that the boss is about to be sacked.

But when Newcastle chief Mike Ashley told a reporter that Alan Pardew was ‘dead, finished and over’ in Soho on Thursday night, he was as good as guaranteeing the manager’s future.

Billionaire Ashley does not do Press interviews and, as his lawyers later insisted, he was ‘humouring’ the journalist who approached him while on a night out with friends. 

Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has been under fire  of late with supporters demanding he gets sacked

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley denied he was being serious in saying manager Pardew could lose his job

Indeed, sources close to Ashley insist Pardew’s position is not under threat and he will be given time to improve results which see United bottom of the Premier League ahead of tomorrow’s trip to Stoke.

Certainly, Pardew, 53, was not fazed by his paymaster’s comments. ‘I think he was trying to be supportive in his own kind of way,’ said Pardew.

‘They [the comments] are what they are and unfortunately we have had those sort of headlines for two or three weeks.

‘Sometimes things are taken out of context. If it was a sit-down interview done in a serious manner I’d be a lot more concerned than I am now, that’s for sure. The focus for me really can only be Monday night.’

Supporters held posters last week making it clear they want Pardew sacked as Newcastle United manager

He added: ‘[The owner] is obviously very keen for us to get victories, that’s what he’s about. That’s what we’re about, winning.

‘I’ve been under pressure at this club for a number of weeks now. All I can focus on now is the team and that’s what I’ll do.’

Ashley had been quoted in The Independent as saying: ‘One more game — if we lose against Stoke on Monday night then he’s gone. I have had enough. 

‘Dead. Finished. Over. One more game then that’s it. What would you do? I have spent a lot of money on that club, it has cost me a lot. I won’t put up with it any more. Honestly, answer me, what would you do? One more loss and he’s gone, he’s over, finished.’ 

Ashley: 'If we lose against Stoke on Monday night then he's gone. I have had enough. Dead. Finished. Over'

But Ashley’s lawyers have since maintained: ‘Mr Ashley responded, tongue in cheek, that Mr Pardew had two more games before being sacked.

‘To put this into perspective, over the past few weeks certain reports have stated that they believe that Mr Pardew has two more games before being sacked. Mr Ashley was therefore humouring the reporter.’

A spirited comeback to draw 2-2 with Hull last weekend followed by a midweek win at Crystal Palace in the Capital One Cup has eased the pressure on Pardew.

Papiss Cisse came from the bench to score twice against Hull, while £6million signing Emmanuel Riviere broke his duck for the club with a double at Selhurst Park.

And Pardew says his own mood has been cheered by events of the past week.

‘You’re going to carry some scars so it does change your mood when you get lifts like we’ve had this week,’ he said. ‘In particular in the striking department we’ve really had a lift.

Pardew was heartened by the 3-2 Capital One cup win against Crystal Palace in midweek 

‘We’ve looked OK in the majority of games and have deserved more points than we have. But at the same time we’ve looked like we’re not going to score too many goals.

‘The lift from the strikers has helped the squad and it will certainly settle us.’

It was during a 1-0 defeat by Stoke in April that Newcastle supporters rounded on Pardew amid his lingering fallout with Hatem Ben Arfa, who eventually joined Hull on loan last month.

Again, during United’s last away outing in the league — a 4-0 defeat by Southampton — fans called for their manager to go. But planned protests in the subsequent home match with Hull were muted and the travelling contingent at Palace were supportive of the team.

The Magpies salvaged a 2-2 draw against Hull in their last league game, with Papiss Cisse scoring twice 

‘We can’t argue with how the fans responded to us at Crystal Palace,’ said Pardew.

‘If they could replicate that at Stoke I would be absolutely delighted.

‘We’ve had two morale-boosting displays, the comeback draw against Hull and then the win at Crystal Palace which gives us something to lean on.

‘That’s given us all a lift and we go to Stoke looking for our first win. We must do better than just getting one win, of course, because there are a lot of games to go.’
