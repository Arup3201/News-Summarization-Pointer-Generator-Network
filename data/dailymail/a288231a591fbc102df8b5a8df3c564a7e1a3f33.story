Andrej Kramaric's has completed his move to Leicester on a contract until June 2018.

The 23-year-old, understood to have cost City £9.5million from Rijeka, is available to face Stoke this Saturday at the King Power Stadium.

Kramaric's lack of international experience, with only four caps to his name, meant a permit was not automatically granted, but he had agreed terms and undertook a medical last week.

'He's an extremely talented young footballer and I'm delighted we've been able to finalise his signing. He is potentially a very important addition for us.'
