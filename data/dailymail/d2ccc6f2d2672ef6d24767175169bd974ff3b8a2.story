Challenge: His remarks came as David Cameron effectively admitted the fate of the entire North-South rail project now lay in Labour's hands

The controversial HS2 rail link took a fresh blow last night after Labour compared it with the Millennium Dome.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls made clear that Labour, if elected, would not repeat the ‘mistake’ of the Dome and waste public money on unnecessary schemes inherited from a previous Tory government.

In a BBC interview about the high- speed rail project, Mr Balls was challenged over Labour’s record in adopting the Conservative-inspired Dome – now the O2 Arena –  in South-East London, and building it despite the costs soaring to £750million.

Mr Balls replied: ‘The Millennium Dome was a Conservative vanity project which the Labour government should have scrapped in 1997 and didn’t.

‘It was a mistake and I think you should learn from your mistakes.’

His remarks came as David Cameron effectively admitted the fate of the entire North-South rail project now lay in Labour’s hands, saying it could not go ahead without cross-party support.

Mr Balls’ intervention comes ahead of a crucial week for the ambitious scheme, with Ministers due to publish a comprehensive ‘business case’ showing HS2’s expected benefits.

There is also a vital Commons vote on the Bill paving the way for HS2, with more than 30 Tory MPs expected to rebel against the idea – despite it being seen as a flagship ‘infrastructure’ plan by the Coalition.

Labour, which originally proposed the idea of a North-South high-speed link, has already made it clear there is no ‘blank cheque’ for the scheme, which would take 225mph trains from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds.

But in the Radio 5 Live interview, the Shadow Chancellor raised fresh hurdles for the plans. He appeared to signal that even if the costs did not escalate beyond the current  estimated £50billion bill, there was no guarantee an incoming Labour government would persist with it.

‘There are two sides to this ledger,’ he said. ‘There is the cost and the benefit. And we need to know – are the costs under control? Secondly, are the benefits really there so that this would be the best way to spend that money.’

He also accused Chancellor George Osborne of appearing like a ‘cheerleader’ for the scheme regardless of the costs and benefits. 

Mistake: The Millennium Dome was a scheme inherited by Labour from a previous Tory government but its cost soared to £750million and was largely seen as a vanity project

Last week, Mr Cameron challenged Labour to come clean on its real intentions for HS2, saying  massive projects such as this  – which would take 20 years to complete – ‘can’t go ahead without all-party support’. The Prime Minister said that if Labour abandoned the plan, ‘they will be letting down the Midlands, they will be letting down the North’.

The Mail on Sunday has learnt that Mr Cameron’s intervention came after a private meeting with Andrew Bridgen, the East Midlands Tory MP who is spearheading this week’s rebellion against the project.

Mr Bridgen said he told the Prime Minister that, as with the vote on military action against Syria last month, Labour would leave him in the lurch and come out against HS2.

Labour sources last night insisted that the party ‘supports HS2 in  principle’ and was a ‘critical friend’ to the project. But Labour has been challenged to explain why its MPs are not being ordered to be at Westminster on Thursday to support the HS2 Bill. They are on a ‘one-line whip’, which means they have to vote for the rail plan only if they  are at the Commons on the day.
