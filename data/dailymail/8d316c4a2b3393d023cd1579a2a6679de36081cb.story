'Sextortionist': Police found thousands of pictures of naked and semi-naked women on Karen 'Gary' Kazaryan's computer

A man accused of blackmailing hundreds of women into stripping for him as he watched over the internet could face a 105 year prison sentence.

So-called 'sextortionist' Karen 'Gary' Kazaryan, 27, is said to have coerced more than 350 young women into showing him their naked bodies by hacking into their Facebook and e-mail accounts, posing as a friend, and coaxing them to strip as he watched via Skype - often capturing images of them shedding their clothes.

Kazaryan, of Glendale, California, is also alleged to have searched the accounts he hacked for existing naked or revealing pictures of his victims, which - if a woman discovered his ruse - he would use to blackmail her into yet more stripping.

Around 3,000 pictures of naked and semi-naked women were discovered on Kazaryan's computer, according to federal investigators, who said the 27-year-old would repeatedly contact his victims and demand they expose themselves to him over Skype.

In some cases he is accused of posting naked pictures to the victims' Facebook pages when they refused his demands.

He was arrested yesterday and is facing 15 charges of computer intrusion and 15 of aggravated identity theft, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison told the Associated Press.

Not all of the women allegedly targeted in Kazaryan's complex scam have been identified, but FBI investigators estimate he had over 350 victims.

It is thought most were aged 20 or younger, and local to Kazaryan's home city of Glendale.

Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office, said most of the victims were local to the Glendale area.

If convicted, Kazaryan faces up to 105 years in jail. He is due to appear in court in the U.S. on March 12.

Sextortion is a term used to describe the exploitation of a victim who is blackmailed using a nude image of themselves shared over the internet.
