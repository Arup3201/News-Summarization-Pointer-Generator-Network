A bar owner who raped three girls after serving them alcohol until they passed out has been sentenced to 100 years in prison.

Werner Fajardo, 35, assaulted the three girls, two 14-year-olds and a 12-year-old, after he poured them drinks at his closed tavern El Cuervo, in Huron, South Dakota last year.

Third Circuit Judge Jon Erickson said it was one of the worst rape cases he had seen in 35 years behind the bench when he sentenced Fajardo on Tuesday.

100 years in prison: Werner Fajardo, pictured being led from jail in November last year, has been jailed for raping three girls after serving them alcohol

The three friends were meant to be babysitting when they met up with Fajardo, who drove them to his bar and began pouring the girls drinks including vodka shots and mixed vodka drinks, police said.

After drinking several drinks, the girls passed out or become so woozy they could not move, according to court documents.

Fajardo, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota allegedly touched one of the girl’s genitals and another woke to find her pants and underwear down, and a condom wrapper on a table nearby, authorities said.

The 12-year-old girl told police she woke up to find Fajardo having sex with her on October 30, last year.

Michael R. Moore, Beadle County's state attorney, said last year: ‘They all told a similar story of what happened that night, that they drank this alcohol and then passed out. 

‘They all had similar memories of what happened, but none of them were able to say what happened to the other person.’

Police said in an affidavit: ‘The bar was closed but the defendant started mixing drinks for the girls.’

One of the 14-year-old girls told her parents about the assault on November 11 and police began investigating Fajardo and uncovered allegations of underage drinking at the bar in Huron, a town with a population of about 13,000 people.

The Huron Police Department found 11 minors at the bar when they conducted their first ever alcohol licence compliance check at El Cuervo.

State regulators revoked Fajardo's liquor license in January and the bar was closed. 

Defense attorney Carmen Means says Fajardo continues to maintain his innocence.
