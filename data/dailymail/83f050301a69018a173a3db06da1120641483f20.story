Gloucester have announced that Tom Lindsay will be joining the club from Wasps at the end of the season.

The 27-year-old hooker has spent the whole of his career at Wasps since joining 11 years ago, making over 100 appearances and going on to achieve international recognition with the England Saxons.

He has been a regular in the squad this season, but has opted to move to Kingsholm as they build for the 2015-16 season.

Director of rugby David Humphreys was pleased with the deal, telling the club's official website: "We are delighted to be bringing a player of Tom's quality and experience to the squad for next season.

'His set-piece work is good, he carries the ball well, he's English qualified with a lot of experience and we hope has his best years ahead of him.

'Next season is unique due to the delayed start of the Aviva Premiership and the intensity of the season after the Rugby World Cup will test the depth of every squad. We are preparing for that and continue to build a squad with quality players competing for each starting spot.'

Lindsay, who will compete with Richard Hibbard and Darren Dawidiuk for a starting berth, added: 'I feel that the time is now right for me to experience a new environment to help me really develop and achieve my potential.

'The opportunity to move to Gloucester is an exciting one, and one I'm really looking to when the time arises.

'I've always enjoyed playing at Kingsholm, it's a great, traditional rugby venue and, with the city hosting Rugby World Cup matches in 2015, it's going to be a great place to be next season.'
