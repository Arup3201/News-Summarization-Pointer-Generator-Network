Lewis Hamilton, who joined Simon Fuller’s management stable to fulfil his dream of fame and riches in America, has decided to take control of his own management affairs.

Hamilton turned to Fuller’s XIX Entertainment group after splitting from his father Anthony after the 2009 season, but Sportsmail has learned that his contract with the company recently expired.

Although neither side would comment on the development, an industry insider said: ‘Lewis is concentrating on the world championship for now and will assess how to progress with his management around New Year.

‘He has been muttering for a year or so about changing his relationship with Fuller. He wants to stand on his own two feet — and cut down on commission fees.’

Paddock sources say Hamilton, who is ranked among the world’s most marketable sportsmen with a £68million fortune, is unlikely to seek a professional reunion with his father, despite Anthony’s recent attendance at races in Italy and Singapore.

The pair appear to have mended their sometimes fractious relationship, but Lewis is known to prefer their current father-son bond to a management-client association. Members of Fuller’s staff are continuing to help Hamilton with his public relations for now. But Fuller, the media mogul who managed the Spice Girls and David Beckham, will not be involved in negotiating the driver’s next contract.

Fuller’s greatest coup was sealing Hamilton’s current Mercedes contract. It brought his man about £30m-a-year and a winning car.

However, that deal was struck with Ross Brawn and Nick Fry — both of whom have left the team — as well as Niki Lauda, the non-executive chairman. Relations between Hamilton’s side and Mercedes are not as harmonious since Toto Wolff took over from Brawn.

With Hamilton’s contract due to expire next year, a hard and potentially messy negotiation awaits him and his new advisers.

A number of paddock veterans, including the late Ayrton Senna’s manager Julian Jakobi, would be keen to enlist Hamilton, but he is likely to eschew Formula One specialists to seek advisers who are more used to the celebrity side.

Hamilton, 29, has a love for Hollywood and especially the music industry. His girlfriend is American pop star Nicole Scherzinger, he is friendly with several rap stars and has talked about starting his own record label.

He spends much of his time in Los Angeles with Scherzinger, and once told Sportsmail: ‘It’s really cool over here. I love LA and I can see myself maybe living there one day.’

Fuller was mostly notable by his absence from Formula One, allowing Tom Shine, the former Reebok executive, to act as Hamilton’s regular aide and travelling companion, but he has not been at Hamilton’s side for some time.

Hamilton came to Austin this weekend via New York, where he appeared — albeit for less than a minute — on NBC’s high-rating Today show.

Having got to the Circuit of the Americas, he opened with the fastest time in morning practice, a small step towards recording his fifth consecutive win and extending his 17-point lead over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Can Hamilton keep his momentum through the final three races of the season?

‘I don’t see why not,’ he said. ‘But Nico’s going to be strong this weekend. He’s going to be pushing. The tables could always turn. Nico has shown this year that every race he bounces back. He’s strong. And I would do the same. 

'We should have a great car this weekend. I’ve been strong here in the past. The last few races I’ve really felt great. When I was trailing to Nico, it was almost like there was a wall and I was trying to climb it but couldn’t quite get over it. But I’ve got over it now.’

Victory here would make Hamilton the most successful British driver in terms of races won (Sir Jackie Stewart won three championships and 27 races at a higher average). He stands on 31 wins, level with Nigel Mansell.

Of that piece of beckoning history, Hamilton said: ‘It’s an incredible feeling. I never thought that I would be put on a record board with the greats. To be among the great drivers in the UK is a really proud feeling.

‘But I don’t really think about it as much, because I just want to win the championship. Perhaps at the end of the year I will be able to look back and really think about it. But I want to win the world championship. That’s the most important thing.’

Hamilton’s hope is that the double points on offer at the last race in Abu Dhabi will not tilt the title away from him. But Rosberg, asked if he would be uneasy winning in this way, said: ‘Not really, no. It is just the way it is in sport unfortunately.

‘It doesn’t really matter, although of course it is a bit artificial.’ He added with a smile: ‘Being behind, I love the double points. It has been the best idea of the season!’

The non-appearance of Marussia and Caterham, who are in administration, means today’s qualifying session will be revamped. Four cars will be eliminated in the first two sessions to leave the usual 10 in the shoot-out for pole, the prime position for which Hamilton is favourite.
