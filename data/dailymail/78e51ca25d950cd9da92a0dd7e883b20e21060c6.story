Celtic have confirmed Norwegian Ronny Deila as their new manager.

The 38-year-old arrived in Glasgow with Chief Executive Peter Lawwell on Thursday night and has signed a 12-month rolling contract to become Neil Lennon’s successor.

And following 48 hours of negotiations with Norwegian champions Stromsgodset over compensation Deila was unveiled as the club’s 18th manager at a Parkhead press conference on Friday afternoon.

As Sportsmail first revealed 
Deila originally came to Celtic’s attention as a potential replacement 
for Johan Mjallby as Neil Lennon’s number two.

After 
talks with Henrik Larsson, Roy Keane and Stevie Clarke, however, the 
club’s powerbrokers have opted for the man who led Stromsgodset to their
 first title in 43 years.

It’s
 believed Celtic have agreed to pay around £300,000 in compensation to 
secure their man and former Scotland and Celtic midfielder John Collins 
is expected to to be his assistant manager.

'It
 is a magnificent honour to be named the new Manager of Celtic,' said 
Deila, 'one of the world’s great football clubs and a club I have such 
enormous respect for.  I will treasure this opportunity and will give 
everything I have to achieve success for Celtic and our wonderful fans.

'I
 know what I want for Celtic and our supporters and that is the best of 
everything, it is what our fans deserve. I want to deliver the best 
attacking, exciting and entertaining football we can play, for the 
players to give their best every time they take to the field of and of 
course I want my players to work with me to achieve the best results 
possible and bring trophies to Celtic.

'Celtic
 is in great shape and the Club has enjoyed real success in recent years
 due to the hard work of Neil and his team.  I want to carry on this 
work and continue to bring happy times to Celtic.   I can’t wait to get 
started on this journey.'

Celtic
 Chairman Ian Bankier welcomed the new man saying: 'We are delighted to 
have secured Ronny as Celtic Manager. He is a highly regarded individual
 and a man who we are confident will bring great success to Celtic.  He 
is a forward thinking coach and manager with a progressive approach.  
The Celtic Board will support Ronny fully and in every way and we look 
forward to working with him.'

Chief
 Executive Peter Lawwell secured his man after flying to Norway on 
Thursday and said: 'We believe Ronny will prove to be a fresh and 
dynamic new manager and someone who will give us a bright and energetic 
way forward for Celtic.'

Going back? Former Celtic player John Collins has been linked with a return to the club as assistant manager

'Knowing
 that he was so highly rated across Europe, Ronny was one of the first 
candidates we considered as Manager and having discussed the opportunity
 with him at length, we are convinced he has the talent and the 
determination to deliver very positive results for the Club and our 
supporters.

'Ronny
 likes to play attacking, winning football, the Celtic way, something I 
know our supporters will endorse.   As the new season begins, I am sure 
our fans will get right behind Ronny and the players once again as we 
aim to bring success to Celtic and continue to deliver a Club they can 
be proud of.'

Deila was recommended to Celtic by contacts at English champions Manchester City and, speaking before the appointment was confirmed, predecessor Neil Lennon said: 'He came highly recommended, he's highly thought of.

'I don't know if it's confirmed with Celtic yet, but I know from contacts in the game that he is well respected as a coach.

No go: Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane asked not to be considered for the Celtic job

'We recruited Stefan Johansen from Stromsgodset, so we were aware of his work. It'll be interesting to see if Ronny gets the job.'

Lennon was 'surprised and a little bit disappointed' that former Celtic and Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane had asked not to be considered for the Parkhead post.

The Irishman opted to stay on as Republic of Ireland assistant to Martin O'Neill and has has been linked with the number two job at Aston Villa under Paul Lambert.

Backing: Predecessor Neil Lennon has backed Deila's credentials after he came highly recommended

'I think he's ready for it,' said the Northern Irishman. 'He's had, what, three years since he was out of the game as a manager and he's been watching a lot of games, he's been at Champions League games, and he's got vast experience.

'He fits the identikit of a Celtic manager. I can totally understand his situation, that it's a personal decision, but I was hoping he would take it.

'He would have given the club a big lift.'
