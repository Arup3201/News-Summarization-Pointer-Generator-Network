In light of information that a fleet of Russian ships are on their way to Australian waters, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has downplayed the apparent show of strength.

The move appears to be a show of force from Russia, whose leader Vladimir Putin met with Mr Abbott at the APEC leader's summit on Tuesday in Beijing.

The pair discussed the MH17 tragedy and Abbott demanded an apology and compensation for the victims of the doomed flight from Putin, citing a similar case where the US took these actions after accidentally shooting down an aircraft. 

The prime minister said the journey had been planned for sometime, and while it was unusual, the move is not entirely unprecedented.

'Plainly it takes weeks, if not months, to deploy warships thousands of miles from your bases,' Mr Abbott said.

A fleet of Russian warships are reportedly on their way into Australian waters

'So this Russian deployment into Pacific waters is something that has been a long, long time in preparation.

'It's not unusual for Russia to deploy naval elements when there are significant international events taking place.

'Certainly it is unusual for Russian naval elements to be in Australian waters.

'Unusual, not entirely unprecedented, but unusual.'

Mr Abbott said the Russian navy also deployed to Singapore when the republic hosted an APEC conference, and in the Pacific when San Francisco when it hosted a major summit.

The prime minister was in Myanmar for the East Asia Summit, where maritime security in the South China Sea was set to dominate discussions.

Australia must also allow freedom of the seas, he said.

'If Australia, the United States and others expect, indeed demand, the right of passage for naval vessels in Asia, obviously we have to accept the right of passage for military or naval vessels in the Pacific,' he said.

Meantime defence confirmed on Wednesday it was monitoring the four Russian naval ships in international waters in the Coral Sea.

Defence Force chief Mark Binskin has downplayed the strength of the Russian naval fleet.

Asked why Russia was sending four ships to the international summit instead of the usual one or two, he indicated they weren't all warships.

Russia had publicised its intent to deploy a task force to the South Pacific a while ago, and an ocean-going tug and an oiler are part of that group.

'So it's just one part of their operations. They're in international waters. They're allowed to do that. And we'll continue to surveil them,' he said.

The news comes after the highly anticipated exchange between Mr Abbott and Mr Putin at this week's APEC summit.  

There were reportedly 'no harsh words' between the two leaders

The force could be in Australian waters outside of Brisbane by the weekend when the G20 summit will be held

While 'no harsh words' were exchanged during the 15-minute meeting, Russia rejected Mr Abbott's demand the Kremlin apologise for the downing of the passenger jet MH17 over Ukraine.

The attack resulted in the deaths of 298 people, including 38 Australian citizens and residents, and is believed to have been carried out by separatists using Russia equipment.

Asked if the ships were a show of force, Air Chief Marshal Binskin said: 'You'll have to ask the Russians.'

CEO of Intelligent Risks Neil Fergus said on the Today Show that while it is a show of strength there is 'not necessarily anything wrong because the fleet will stay out in international waters and doesn't need permission'.

'Putin has organised fleets in recent years when he goes to these summits,' Mr Fergus added, as he explained Putin's father was in the navy so there are strong family ties. 

Australian ships HMAS Parramatta and HMAS Stuart have been sent to monitor the fleet.

A P3 Orion Surveillance Aircraft has also been deployed to the area to monitor the ships along with an Anzac class frigate, Seven News reported.

Mr Putin and Mr Abbott will have further discussions in Brisbane

When Australian ships reach the Russian fleet Mr Fergus said there will be some 'polite engagement and navy discourse'.

But he stressed 'there should be no alarm about diplomacy happening on the high seas'. 

It's not the first time Russian naval vessels have been present while an international summit is on.

Russian warships were around for an APEC meeting in Singapore in 2009 as well as former Russian president Dimitri Medvedev's visit to San Francisco in 2010.

Defence is directing further questions regarding the vessels to Russian authorities.

Abbott reportedly knew of a developing security threat to Australia when he left China earlier on Wednesday.

Putin is said to have ordered the fleet, and it has been instructed to 'show the flag' on Saturday morning, The Daily Telegraph reported.

A senior government source told The Daily Telegraph the intentions of the Russian leader were obvious.

'There is no doubt this is posturing, to show the power of the Russia fleet,' the source said.

While still south of Bougainville in the Coral Sea, the force could be outside of Brisbane by the weekend when the G20 summit will be held.

Defence said the movement of the Russian vessels is consistent with provisions under international law, allowing military vessels to exercise freedom of navigation in international waters.

At this point Russia has made no request to port in Australia, and if they wished to do so would have to provide at least 48 hours notice.

The fleet is reportedly led by a guided missile cruiser ahead of destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov.

Tug boat Fotiy Krylov and supply tanker Boris Butoma round out the second half of the group.

Meantime there are security measures building onshore in Brisbane before world leaders arrive in the capital city in the coming days.

Beefed up police forces have already at the Brisbane Exhibition and Convention Centre where the G20 summit will be held.

Officers have been stationed to guard gates and entrances, block roads and patrol the areas around the centre. 

Road blocks are also in place ahead of the meeting which will see leaders from around the world in Australia

Additional officers will be patrolling the areas surrounding the convention centre
