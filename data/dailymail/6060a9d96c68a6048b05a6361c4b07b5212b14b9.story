Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

West Ham have taken just one point from their last six Premier League encounters with Manchester City (L5 D1).

Sergio Aguero (108 mins) has the best mins-per-goal rate of any player in Barclays Premier League history (excluding players with fewer than 20 goals).

The Hammers lost four times to City last season (twice in the league and both legs of the League Cup semi-final).

City secured the league title against West Ham on the final day of last season with a 2-0 win at the Etihad. The Hammers did not muster a single shot on target.

West Ham have won four league games this season. In 2013-14 they didn’t reach this tally until January.

Manchester City's Stephen Ireland (centre) holds off the challenge of West Ham's Scott Parker (left) and Herita Ilunga during a Premier League in March 2009. Jack Collison's 71st minute winner for the Hammers at Upton Park was their most recent victory over the current Premier League champions

City have gone five Premier League games without defeat, the second longest current run in the division.

Sergio Aguero’s record of nine goals in his team’s opening eight games has never been bettered in Premier League history.

Aguero has scored four away goals in the Premier League this season. He has never scored more than seven on the road in a single campaign.

Diafra Sakho is only the second player in Premier League history (after Mick Quinn) to score in each of his first five starts in the competition.

West Ham have allowed the opposition fewer clear cut chances (7) than any other Premier League team this season.
