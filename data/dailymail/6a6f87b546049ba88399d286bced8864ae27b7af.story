A 17-year-old high school football player has passed away after drinking too much water during practice.

Zyrees Oliver, a star student and athlete at Douglas County High School in Georgia, drank two gallons of water and two gallons of Gatorade to stave off cramps last Tuesday, his relatives said.

He felt better that evening but on Wednesday morning - just hours before he was set to start his first day of his senior year - he collapsed in his Douglasville home and was rushed to hospital.

Doctors said Zyrees was brain dead after suffering devastating brain swelling from water intoxication, family members told WSB-TV in Atlanta.  

Loss: Zyrees Oliver, 17, collapsed last week after drinking four gallons of fluids during football practice. The amount of water consumed in a short space of time left him with water intoxication and brain damage

At 1am on Monday, after five days in the hospital, his family took him off life support. 

'The water flooded his system and his brain started to swell,' his cousin Bryant Stewart explained to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

His aunt, Tammy Chavis, added: 'You think with dehydration, the more water you give, the better you're making it. No, not in all cases, it does the opposite.' 

He had consumed the liquids after suffering cramps, which he believed were due to dehydration during practice the day before school began.

He had been suffering from the cramps for months, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

In mourning: He was just hours from starting his senior year at Douglas County High School in Georgia (pictured), where he was a talented football player and a good student, with a GPA of 3.8

Proud: Zyrees, who was on life support for 5 days before it was turned off, had hoped to play football at college

Water intoxication, or hyponatremia, occurs when too much water is consumed in a short period of time. It causes the body's other nutrients, such as sodium, to become too diluted, making it impossible for them to function properly.

There is no universal rule about how much water is too much, but the Mayo Clinic suggests drinking at least eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day, but exercise calls for an extra 1.5 to 2.5 cups. Warmer temperatures and pregnancy also call for a higher consumption of water.

Water intoxication is extremely rare, but babies and athletes are most susceptible. Symptoms include headache, changes in behavior, confusion, drowsiness. It can lead to seizures, coma or death, but if it is caught, it can be treated with diuretics to increase urination or IV fluids to replace electrolytes.

The high school principal, Tim Scott, informed students of Zyrees' death on Monday and said grief counselors were at the school to help.

'We are saddened to inform you of the death of Zyrees Oliver, a senior at Douglas County High School,' the statment to students said.

'He passed away early this morning.'

Zyrees, who regularly shared photos showing him posing in his football uniform to social networking sites, hoped to play football in college and held a 3.8 GPA.

His family moved from New Jersey to Georgia for a fresh start a year ago, but Zyrees quickly settled in and was a natural leader on and off the football field, his relatives said.

He is survived by his parents and three brothers. 

His family is now raising money on a gofundme page to fly his body to New Jersey.

An autopsy will be conducted by the Georgia Bureau of Investigations to determine the cause of his death.

While rare, water intoxication is caused when too much water is consumed in a short period of time, diluting other nutrients in the body and putting pressure on the brain. If not treated, it can lead to coma or death.
