Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas endured an eventful night at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. After scoring early on, the Spaniard was at fault for Schalke's equaliser - and he even got a ticking off from the referee for wearing jewellery.

Fabregas has earned many plaudits for his, and Chelsea's, impressive start to the season, but Wednesday night's Champions League tie saw him at his best, worst, and most bizarre.

After signing for the west London club in the summer for £30m, Fabregas has been at the heart of a Chelsea team that has won all four of their Premier League matches so far this season.

In the 11th minute against Schalke, following a tackle many deemed to be reckless and card-worthy, Fabregas slotted past Ralf Fahrmann to put the home side ahead.

Later though, the more negative side of the £150,000 a week midfielder's game came to the fore, as he was at fault for the Schalke equaliser that Chelsea could not overcome. 

Shortly before this, came the bizarre.

After 56 minutes, in an event more commonly seen on a Sunday league field, the referee Ivan Bebek stopped play and asked Fabregas to remove a bracelet he deemed to be dangerous to proceedings. 

The official then made sure it was removed, before eventually allowing play to continue.

Unfortunately for Chelsea, and a bracelet-less Fabregas, the west Londoners conceded just five minutes later and could not regain the lead thereafter.

Schalke held on for a point, and after a 1-1 draw in the other Group G match, all four teams are level going into the next Champions League match-day.
