In an unusual opportunity a petting farm has popped up on the market, just a stone's throw away from a capital city.

The Hahndorf Farm Barn is a farm and homestead in one with mountain views splayed over nine hectares of land.

Located in the Adealide Hills, the sprawling property looks over Mt Lofty and the Hahndorf township - Australia's oldest surviving German township.

The Hahndorf Farm Barn in South Australia is on the market

The property spans nine hectares and includes a huge homestead

The homestead overlooks the Adelaide Hills and mountains in the area

The large family home has recently undergone extensive renovations to bring it into the modern age

The farm has been in business since 1999, is a popular tourist attraction in the area and allows kids and adults alike to interact with animals and wildlife.

Horse and motorbike riding, cuddles with the friendly farm animals and a chance to feed the wildlife are all offered at the the farm, which has grown by 140 percent under the current owners.

And those owners are - but not for long - South Australian radio presenter Jason 'Snowy' Carter and his wife Kate, who have lived on the property for the past four years.

The homestead has five bedrooms with views over the vast land

There are also three bathrooms in the home

The kitchen is brand new with stone bench tops and plenty of storage room

Mr Carter works for Mix 102.3, and has four children with his wife. He grew up on a farm and wanted his children to have the same opportunity. 

'The ability to be able to live on such an amount of land, and the kids be able to run around and ride horses and ride their motorcycles - it was always a dream of mine to have my family to be able to do that', Mr Carter told Arabella Hooper from Toop & Toop real estate.

'(And with) the Adelaide Hills being so close to the city ... it's 20 minutes in fact to get to the town without all the hustle and bustle,' he added.

The home features many open plan living areas and places for the family to relax

The large number of bedrooms in the house means it would be perfect for a big family

Most rooms in the house have a spectacular view of the sprawling grounds

The living room extends into a spacious outdoor area and then on to the acreage 

'The other thing for me too was just when we saw it we thought what great value for money, and it came with a business.' 

The homestead has been completely renovated to 'bring the home into the new age', according to Mr Carter, and brags five bedrooms, three bathrooms, a brand new kitchen and open plan living space.

There's also a kid's playroom, home office, casual dining room and floor to ceiling glass in the lounge area showing off sprawling views of the hillside.

The farm is a well-established business and despite the current owners having no experience in such areas, still easily managed to run it.
