For a Manchester United manager, there is never really a honeymoon period. Louis van Gaal probably realised that as soon as his team lost their opening game of the Barclays Premier League season to Swansea at Old Trafford.

As United prepare to return to action at West Brom on Monday, however, it is hard to escape the feeling that their season, to all intents and purposes, starts now. 

The first thing Van Gaal did when he arrived at Old Trafford was to ask for time and that was reasonable. The squad he inherited from David Moyes lacked balance, he stressed, and he was right. This was a dressing room, for example, that had more No 10s than Trafford bus depot.

United are fourth in the Premier League

Several weeks on, however, and the Premier League landscape is a little clearer.

United have been patchy and scratchy. Their last two home wins in the league – 2-1 against West Ham and Everton – could easily have been draws. However, there has been improvement from early season struggles and as Premier League football returns again this weekend United sit fourth, back in the Champions League positions for the first time in a long time.

Certainly there is opportunity for Van Gaal's United as they look forwards. A tilt at the Premier League title is maybe beyond them – that already looks like a two-horse race – but with expected top four rivals such as Liverpool, Arsenal, Everton and Tottenham already experiencing problems of their own there is no reason why a fit and functioning United team should not do enough to ensure they are back in Europe’s blue riband competition next season.

Perhaps we will learn much over the next two-and-half weeks. By the time the next international break begins United will have faced West Brom, Chelsea, Manchester City.

Former United captain Gary Neville said this week: 'We'll find out about United in the next few weeks as the West Brom, Chelsea and City games are all massive ones.

'We'll find out exactly the level where the team is at this season.

'We've not really played anybody really strong yet.

'I know Everton at home could be classed as being a tough game but, in terms of really tough matches, Chelsea and City will provide a real measure of where this team is at.'

United certainly have the firepower to trouble any team now. The attacking players Van Gaal has at his disposal could have been taken straight from somebody’s fantasy football team.

Further to that, Van Gaal should now  see the defensive injury crisis that has plagued his early season efforts begin to ease and with midfielder Michael Carrick closer to a first-team return after ankle trouble there is every reason why the Dutch coach should see improvement.

'We've shown glimpses over the last few weeks and hopefully we'll have a lot of players coming back for these next games,' confirmed United assistant manager Ryan Giggs on Thursday.

'These are the games you want to be involved in and play in. And they will be a test.

'Chelsea have probably been the standout team so far with City just behind them and we want to be up there testing ourselves against those teams.

'We feel that we do belong up there but we perhaps haven't shown it consistently this season.

'The form has slowly begun to get better and better and we want to hit form going into those matches.'

As anyone who watches them knows, United’s season has been categorised by two stark opposites. Their attacking play has been excellent at times while their defending has been modest at best.

As Van Gaal has pointed out himself, the responsibility for defending lies with the whole team and, by extension, the coach himself.

United continue to have problems keeping the ball and in the absence of Carrick and Marouane Fellaini – also fit again now – there has been no midfield shield to protect Van Gaal’s back four when his team lose the ball.

If this aspect of United’s play does not improve against the two favourites for the league title in the coming weeks then it is hard to see them taking anything from the games.

Equally, United need to find a way to improve in the last half an hour of matches. Startling statistics reveal that they have not scored a goal beyond the 62nd minute of any game this season but have conceded eight in that time.

Van Gaal knows he still has plenty to do before United return to their glory days

Van Gaal may dismiss that as a co-incidence and would certainly rail against any notion that his team isn’t fit enough.

However, it’s a statistic that has damaged United hugely so far this season. 

If they can put that right against West Brom, Chelsea and Manchester City over the next 16 days then the winter will begin to look rather less dark.
