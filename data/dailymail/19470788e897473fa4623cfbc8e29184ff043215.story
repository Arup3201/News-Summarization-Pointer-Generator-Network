Amazon has launched a budget £159 tablet it hopes can take on the iPad mini.

The Fire HD tablet, which is based on Google's Android software, has a 7inch touchscreen and is linked to Amazon's own app, music and book store.

It will go head to head with Apple's £269 iPad mini, which is launched next week, and Google's £159 Nexus 7 tablet.

The tablet wars: How they stack up

Amazon has released two version, a cheaper £129 Fire with a poorer quality screen, and the £159 Fire HD, which experts expect to be the big seller.

Amazon hopes the low price will help it take on Apple, who release the iPad mini in the UK next week for.

'The biggest factor is price - the Kindle Fire HD is so much cheaper,' said Chris Hall of gadget Web Site Pocket Lint.

'The Kindle name is well know, so it's not entirely new to people, and most potential owners probably already have some Kindle books or have bought content from Amazon.'

Mr Hall believes the key difference between the tablets is their interface.

'Amazon has decided to make it content focused - the focus is on content not apps.

'It really comes down to what you want to do with it - people won't take it into a meeting and tap out notes, but it will be very popular with travellers and commuters.

'It's going to be a fiercly fought battle, and Amazon are slightly on the back foot now the iPad mini has been announced.

'People who couldn't afford an iPad may get a mini instead.'

The new Kindle Fire HD tablet

The Fire HD is a well built tablet, and the rubberised back and surround make it feel more durable than an iPad.

Switch it on, and the 7 inch screen is sharp, clear and easy to read.

However, the main difference is in the software.

The Kindle software puts content, not apps first.

It works using a 'carousel' you scroll through with a finger, with content divided into books, music, apps, video and others.

It's extremely simple to get around, but does feel far more 'contained' that the rivals from Google and Apple - this is a gadget for consuming media rather than any attempt to work.

Sadly, the app selection is also smaller than its rivals, with 50,000 available.

However, there are still most of the big names in there (including the MailOnline app), and the web browser also works well.

For app addicts, this probably isn't the right tablet.

But for those who primarily want a gadget to read and watch films on, the Fire HD is an absolute bargain, and it's only real competition in the budget market comes from Google's Nexus 7, which runs the firm's Android software and has more apps, but a much more complex interface.

Overall, the Fire HD is a winner and could see many people switching from dedicated ebooks into the world of tablets - and the lower price may even lure a few iPad mini purchasers to switch allegiance.

Users can also watch films via Lovefilm as Amazon does not yet have a film service in the UK.

'Kindle Fire HD is our most advanced 7” tablet and is already the bestselling product for Amazon worldwide,' said Jorrit Van der Meulen, VP Kindle, Amazon EU.

'Kindle Paperwhite is the e-reader we always wanted to build and pre-orders have exceeded all expectations.'

'We’re excited that Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD are available to customers in the UK today.'

The firm has also signed up several UK high street retailers to sell the devices.

Steve Monaghan, Waterstones eCommerce and IT Director, said, 'Waterstones is the home of reading on the high street, so it is apt and exciting that we are now able to sell the digital reader's device of choice, Kindle.

'Where better to buy the latest Kindle than somewhere you can be surrounded by inspiration, both in print and from our booksellers - who are happy to advise and discuss books in all their myriad forms.'

'We are excited to offer our customers the opportunity to touch, test and buy the all-new Kindle family from Tesco stores nationwide, as well as online at Tesco Direct' said Tesco Electricals Director Ian Ditcham.

'Kindle was a must-have product for many Tesco customers last Christmas and with the new, expanded range now available at great prices, we think they’ll be appearing on many Christmas lists this year too.'

Adam Brown, buyer for Tablets and Telecoms at John Lewis said, 'There are a plethora of new tablets launching into the market, but the thing that makes the Kindle Fire HD stand out for me is the sheer amount of content that it offers.'

Mark Slater, Category Director for Computing at Currys and PC World, said: 'We're expecting tablets to be hugely popular this Christmas and Amazon's Kindle Fire products should prove no exception.'

The £109 Kindle Paperwhite is the best e-book on the market thanks to its superb screen and easy to use interface

The Kindle Paperwhite 
has a new screen with a built in light meaning it can be read at night as well as in direct sunlight.

It's software has also been updated since the original Kindle, with new features including a Time to Read 
feature that helps readers know the amount of time it will take them to 
finish a chapter or book, X-Ray to explore the 'Bones of a Book,'  and find out more information about character or places.

It's the same small size as previous Kindle's, and the touchscreen is very responsive for page turning.

The screen is a delight - it's sharp, simple to read and makes reading in bed easy, a key complaint about the previous version.

Overall, the Kindle Paperwhite is simply the best e-reader on the market, but is facing an increasing threat from tablet and smartphones, including Amazon's own Kindle Fire.
