There can’t be many one-bedroom terrace houses in Britain with a price tag of nearly £400,000.

But then again, there can’t be many with a view as spectacular as the one from 1 The Turnpike in Strete, Devon. The house overlooks Start Bay, one of the most magnificent stretches of coastline in the West Country.

Besides its stunning vista, the house has the distinction of playing a role in the effort to defeat Nazi Germany during the Second World War.

The terrace dates from the 19th Century and was one of scores of dwellings in the area commandeered by the Ministry of Defence in 1943 to house American troops training for the D-Day landings.

Stunning: The one-bedroom home has a priceless view - or at least one worth £400,000

Slapton Sands in Start Bay was considered the perfect place for U.S. military chiefs to train their men for the Normandy invasion because of its similarity to the layout of Utah Beach, one of the six landing points for Allied troops. The U.S. based 15,000 soldiers around the bay.

While the vista from the house remains as breathtaking as it would have been in the mid-Forties, the interior of 1 The Turnpike is now strikingly modern.

However, when the current owner, optician Ian Wills, bought the property in 2007, he says it looked as if it hadn’t been updated since it was occupied by American GIs.

The upstairs was divided into two small bedrooms and the downstairs space included an old-fashioned kitchen-diner and cramped lounge. Ian set about converting the house into a ultra-modern living space.

Upstairs there is now one large bedroom and state-of-the-art bathroom with underfloor heating, and an open-plan kitchen and lounge below.

To cut running costs, Ian, 48, fitted an air-source heat pump, a system that absorbs heat from outside in summer and releases it inside in winter.

Outside, there is a balcony and a dining terrace – the perfect setting for summer suppers overlooking the sea. The property shares a large garden stretching down to the beach with the other houses in the terrace.

Ian says: ‘About the only thing I didn’t change was the large window in the living area downstairs. I suppose people appreciate a good view whatever era they live in.

'It’s beautiful here on a sunny day but also spectacular when it’s stormy. There’s a lighthouse at one end of the bay, and when that springs into action it’s quite a dramatic sight.’

According to Julie Hill, of selling agents The Coastal House, the vista adds a substantial premium to the home’s value.

‘The view is rare even in this area,’ she says. ‘Many properties may boast coastal views but they are often just glimpses from one or two points, while 1 The Turnpike has an unrestricted panorama from its rooms and the garden.

'A view this good can add up to 100 per cent to the property’s value.’

Ian – who lives with his wife Clair in Chudleigh, Devon, an hour’s drive from Strete – bought the house as a romantic retreat. But having found they are unable to use it as much as they would like, the couple are selling and looking for a second property closer to home.

For the past two years Ian has rented it out as a holiday home for £700 a week in high season and £410 a week in low season.

Last year it yielded £14,000, and he sees it as a viable proposition for a buyer looking for a property to let for about 22 weeks of the year but which they might use themselves in rental ‘windows’.

While the resort of Torcross at the other end of Start Bay is deserted in the winter, Strete remains fairly busy despite the rising number of wealthy second-homers attracted to this part of Devon. There’s a restaurant, a post office and pub in the village open all year round.

Celebrity chef John Burton Race, who appeared in I’m A Celebrity .  .  . Get Me Out Of Here in 2007, lives in Strete, but visitors to the area may well be more interested in the exploits and endea-vours of the American troops based there in the run-up to D-Day.

In April 1944, during a night-time rehearsal for D-Day, German E-boats torpedoed American landing craft in Start Bay, killing 750 troops – more casualties than were actually lost two months later at Utah Beach.

On the beach at Torcross is a Sherman tank, salvaged from the sea as a memorial.
