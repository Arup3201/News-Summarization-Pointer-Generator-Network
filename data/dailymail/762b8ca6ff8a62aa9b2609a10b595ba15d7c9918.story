Cavendish, who rides for Etixx-QuickStep, will take part in the 200-kilometres elite one-day race on August 2, having missed out in 2014 after a crash which ended his Tour de France and resulted in shoulder surgery.

'I can't wait to ride this year,' Cavendish said.

'After only two years, this race is already an event every rider wants to win and you can't beat racing in front of British crowds. After missing out in 2014 I was determined to ride in 2015.'
