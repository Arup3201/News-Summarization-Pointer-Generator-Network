Jo Pavey has described being left off British Athletics' list for top-level funding as 'just another thing to overcome'.

Pavey was a notable absentee on Monday, at the end of a year in which she claimed a 5,000 metres bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games and then the 10,000m European title.

The 41-year-old was not expected to make the cut and she told BBC Sport: 'Obviously I'm disappointed not to get funding but I'm not surprised. I've been in this situation before.

'It is difficult when you get older because you feel like you're putting in the performances but you're probably too old to get the funding.'

Pavey captured the imagination with her summer performances and said of missing out on the funding: 'It's just another thing to overcome.

'I'll be putting the same effort into my training and doing the best I can.'
