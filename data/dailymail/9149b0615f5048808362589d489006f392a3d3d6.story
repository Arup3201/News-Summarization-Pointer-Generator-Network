Pieter Grimminck and Mandy Brander quit their stable jobs, sold their possessions, packed up their belongings and embarked on the road trip of a lifetime.

Departing from their home in the Netherlands in March, the couple journeyed first through Eastern Europe, across Asia to Mongolia on two motorbikes, covering 16 countries in three months.

Mandy, a photographer, has been documenting their adventures in Turkey, Armenia, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and more, capturing breathtaking images along the way and documenting them on their blog, WeWantAdventure.com.

The adventure did not end there, though. Falling head over heels for their new lifestyle, Pieter, 33, and Mandy, 27, have no plans to go 'home' anytime soon. They have been based in Nepal since June and this week depart for a new adventure in India.

The couple's nomadic lifestyle has come with its challenges. They tell MailOnline Travel of going a week without any shower or toilet facilities, off-roading from daybreak to nightfall in remote regions, and facing sandstorms, freezing temperatures and long stretches without encountering another soul.

'In Armenia we were stuck because of heavy snow and a lovely family let us stay in their house for days,' Pieter and Mandy say. 'We felt so welcome, and even though these people are quite poor they welcome you as their own family.'

But the real adventure began, they say, in Tajikistan. 'We already had a lot of bad roads, but Tajikistan was hard. No shower or toilet for a week, sleeping at people's homes on the ground, high altitude, snow, only soup with potato for dinner and eggs in the morning.

The couple spent two days following the Afghanistan border, only separated by a small river.  

And Mongolia was even harder. 'Almost no asphalt, just a lot of small sandy paths or washboard roads,' say Pieter and Mandy, remembering days where they only managed to travel 150km, calling it 'mentally and physically challenging'.

'At some points it felt like there was no ending. Our navigation didn’t work, we didn’t know where we were and the roads were really bad that sometimes we could only drive 10 to 20 km per hour.'

The road ahead: Pieter, 33, and Mandy, 27, sold their possessions and left their lives in Amsterdam behind

In Mongolia, the couple encountered British adventurer Ash Dykes, who made headlines in August when he became the first person to walk solo from the country's border with China to its Russian boundary, camping together for three days. 

Turkey, the reveal, felt like a 'summer holiday', in which they enjoyed 'nice people, the best food, good roads and beautiful nature.

'We noticed that right after every border you directly notice you’re in another country. Even though the change is slower than travelling by plane, every country has its own uniqueness.'

While there have bumps along the road, the couple say their incredible journey has only strengthened their three and a half-year relationship, insisting that, remarkably, they 'never fight' while on the road and don't irritate each other... except for when Mandy is slow to get going in the mornings.

They say: 'We've formed a really good team. Pieter is calm and never afraid. Mandy is more impulsive, but also good in finding information. In difficult situations we always were on the same page. 

'Travelling changes your view on life, and it is great to share this. It’s a completely new lifestyle we were experiencing. Being with each other 24 hours a day is not easy, and we had to get to know each other in this new lifestyle.'

The couple say that travelling has always been a conversation since they met, but that it wasn't until last year that the idea of a motorbike road trip formed.

Committed: They say their journey has only strengthened their three and a half year relationship

Changing scenes: It hasn't been all remote roads for Pieter and Mandy, who also travelled through cities like this in Turkmenistan

It was during a motoring trip in Germany last summer that the fantasy of the epic journey arose. 'We talked about our lives and what we really wanted to do,' they say. 'We knew that we had to do something drastic to be happy with our lives.

Unsatisfied with their jobs and with no children on the immediate agenda, they made the decision at Christmas that they were ready for change. 'We wanted more adventure and less security. To get the most out of ourselves and be open for new opportunities.'

The duo plan to purchase a new bike in Delhi and 'just drive', with a indefinite plan to ride from the Ganges to the sea - undoubtedly capturing beautiful pictures along the way. 

Endless journey: The couple (right) are departing for India this week, and hope to continue their adventure for the foreseeable future
