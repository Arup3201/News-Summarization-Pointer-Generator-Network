They say true beauty never dies, and one Scottish grandmother is certainly an example of this.

Former model Marion Finlayson, 80, has been snapped up by a top Glasgow modelling agency  Colours, after catching the eye of scouts when she graced the catwalk after a 60-year break.

The glamorous grandmother-of-two made her modelling debut back in the 1940s, and decided to tread the runway once again at a charity event in her hometown Aberdeen as a way of distracting herself from her husband Bruce's death.

Back on the runway: Marion made her catwalk comeback at 
Aberdeen City Council's 50 Plus Festival in August, a staggering 60 
years after her modelling debut

Marion, who is grandmother to Antonia, 13, and Andrew, 11, said: 'It's all go at the moment. I've never been busier since appearing on the catwalk last year.

'I actually got offers from two modelling agencies hundreds of miles away in Glasgow.

'It's great fun and I'm just happy to still do something I enjoy. I'm turning 81 next month so I think I'm doing alright.'

Marion made her catwalk comeback at Aberdeen City Council's 50 Plus Festival in August, a staggering 60 years after her fashion debut.

Back in the 1940s she gave up her modelling commitments to become a teacher, but decided to take part in the fashion show in Aberdeen as a distraction from the death of husband Bruce, to whom she was married for 54 years.

Back in the day: Marion as a model in the 40s, before she gave up her career on the catwalk to become a teacher

Marion, who worked at the Albyn School in Aberdeen for years and went on to work with special needs children, said: 'My husband, Bruce, died a year and a
half ago after 54 years of marriage, a very good marriage, and I found 
it very difficult to overcome it,' she explained.

'But doing this catwalk has really helped. I've got to meet lots of new, younger people, which I think is good for me.

'I even had a muscly personal trainer in tartan to walk me down the catwalk.'

Marion says she likes to keep active, and regularly attends yoga and Pilates classes.

Serious style credentials: After a 60 year break she made her return to the fashion world on the catwalk at a 50 Plus Festival in Aberdeen last year and was snapped up

'I do yoga, Pilates and tums and bums
classes every week,' she says. 'My grandchildren are a handful as well,
they're always running about.

'The
modelling was something different and I would definitely do it again. 
If anyone asks me I will have a go - it's better than doing the ironing.

'I've been interested in fashion all my life and I'd be the first to admit that I'm a bit of a shopaholic.'

Marion recently wowed millions of viewers as she appeared on ITV's This Morning show with Eamonn Holmes.

Doing it for the older ladies: Despite the fact modelling is supposedly a young persons' game, Marion has found herself in demand

She said: 'I couldn't believe it. 
They phoned up and just said "we'd love you to come on the programme, 
would you like to do it?".'

She
joked about other people her age: 'They're often talking about their 
pills and their blood pressure, but I don't have any of that yet, I'm as
well as I've ever been.

'I'm really happy with what I'm doing and I hope to carry on for a long time.'

Rosalynd Ramage, who runs Colours Modelling Agency, said: 'The world is Marion's oyster.

'Women
don't stop being interested in fashion or beauty when they reach a 
certain age, so it's only fitting that older models are being used to 
promote products to them.'

Staying in shape: To keep her model figure she keeps active and regularly attends yoga and pilates classes, which are clearly paying off
