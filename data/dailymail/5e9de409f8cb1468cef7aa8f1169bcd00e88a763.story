England's castles and abbeys are among the best-preserved in the world and attract millions of visitors a year.

But the country risked losing these important pieces of history until the invention of the humble petrol lawnmower, the head of English Heritage has said.  

Simon Thurley, chief executive of the organisation, said its invention in 1913 allowed sites to be maintained more easily and ensure historic venues could be opened up to the public for the first time.

Before then England was lagging behind other countries in the protection of key sites.

But the lawnmower helped pave the way for state care of England's most treasured monuments.

Between 1913 and 1939, 600 buildings were brought under the Government's responsibility.

It came after the introduction of the Ancient Monument Act in 1913, which gave architect Sir Charles Reed Peers the task of turning them into a 'museum of history' by opening them to the public.

'There was a really important invention 
that made it possible for him to open these homes out to the public - 
this was the petrol-powered lawnmower,' Mr Thurley was quoted in the 
Daily Telegraph as saying.

It is 20 years since English Heritage was formed, taking over from the Office of Works, and 100 since the introduction of the act.

It is now the steward of over 400 significant historical and archaeological sites, including Stonehenge.

Mr Thurley said as well as the lawnmower, the advent of the car was crucial as it allowed people to travel longer distances.

Speaking at Henley Literary Festival, Mr Thurley said people should remember the landowners that fought to protect England's heritage.

The protection of historic buildings was enshrined in the 1913 Ancient Monuments Act.

Mr Thurley said: 'Everybody realised it could not be left down to individuals.

'I think we have to look back to those landowners who fought for heritage protection in 1913 and what they did for us.'
