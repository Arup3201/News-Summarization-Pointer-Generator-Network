Tourists may be "banned" from parts of Cambridge City centre and ordered to pay a "tax" in a bid to protect the historic city centre from over-crowding and deterioration.

Cambridge City Council is considering a series of "draconian" measures after parts of the city have become no-go areas for normal residents.

Cllr John Hipkin, former Mayor of Cambridge, yesterday called for the city to be turned into a high-calibre heritage and culture destination.

Attractions: Almost four million tourists visit Cambridge each year to see its attractions such as the university (pictured)

He argued for restricting the number of budget hotels to "discourage" short-stay visitors and imposing a "tourist tax" on hotel bills to subsidise public services.

He believes the tourist tax on hotel bills should be handed over to Cambridge City Council to improve the city for its residents.

He said: “The levy, if it were possible and lawful, should be considered for Cambridge because of the impact of tourism on the city.

“The money should be used by the local authority to improve public services such as public toilets and keeping the streets clean.

“Tourists should be required to make a contribution.”

Under his vision long-term all visitors would need to buy a Cambridge Pass to gain exclusive entry to historic and cultural sites, such as colleges and museums.

He said: "Some will consider these suggested measures to control tourism draconian and so they may be but, without strong policies to stabilise or reduce tourist numbers, the character of the city and its amenities, especially in the peak season, will continue to deteriorate.

Restrictions: The Cambridge councillor would also like to see punting and punt touts 'rigorously restricted'

"We need a new vision of Cambridge as
a tourist destination and all those who care for the city must unite to
ensure that it is realised.

"The
vision is of a high calibre, long-stay heritage and culture city at the
hub of connections to nearby sites of historic and natural interest.

Cllr John Hipkin warned that the city is becoming overcrowded

"Casual short-stay tourism should be discouraged."

Cllr John Hipkin warned that the city is becoming overcrowded as the number of tourists visiting Cambridge each year reaches four million.

He said some part of the city centre, such as King's Parade and Quayside, are "off-limits" to residents and that market square is going the same way.

The Cambridge councillor would also like to see punting and punt touts "rigorously restricted".

Diane Thompson, general manager of the Royal Cambridge Hotel, said attracting a mix of tourists was what kept the city's economy afloat.

She said: "I don't think we can turn on one tap and switch off another because it doesn't work like that."

Cllr Neil McGovern, the city council's tourism chief, said Visit Cambridge's focus was already on "value, not volume" tourism.

He said: "Visit Cambridge works hard to maximise the economic impact of our four million visitors each year while also working to reduce any detrimental impact on the city as a result of these high visitor numbers."

Cllr McGovern said Cllr Hipkin's ideas were "interesting" but warned they could damage businesses in the city.
