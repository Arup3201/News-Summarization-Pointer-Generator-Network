The father of kidnap victim Hannah Anderson has quit his job in Tennessee so he can move to San Diego to raise her in the city where she lived with her mother and brother before their murders.

Brett Anderson revealed he told the company, which builds cellular phone towers, that he needed to move from Nashville for his daughter, who was rescued from the clutches of suspected murderer and kidnapper James DiMaggio two weeks ago.

'I'd hoped that Hannah would be able to return to Nashville with me, but I agreed that it was important not to uproot her at this time from everyone and everything she knows and finds to be comfortable, safe and familiar,' Anderson told People Magazine.

'There is no way I will give guardianship of my daughter to anybody – she needs her father and I need my daughter.

'As a result, I called my company today and informed them of my decision to move back to San Diego, and my resignation. Hannah and I will be moving into a home together, and she is as excited as I am to be a family and continue our healing together.'

Christina and 
Ethan Anderson, 8, were found slain at the home of James Lee DiMaggio, 
who police allege set it ablaze earlier this month.

DiMaggio
was killed by FBI agents August 10 in the Idaho wilderness, ending a 
six-day search that spanned much of the western United States and parts of
Canada and Mexico.

But on Tuesday, DiMaggio's sister fiercely defended her brother, claiming there is no evidence pinning him to the alleged murders and that he 'gave his life to protect' Hannah.

In her first 
interview since the story broke, Lora DiMaggio asked Piers Morgan: 'Do 
you believe everything a 16-year-old tells you?' suggesting Hannah, who 
police say was abducted by her much older family friend after he 
tortured and killed her mother and brother, may not be telling the 
truth.

'I
think Hannah got herself into a situation she couldn't get herself out 
of and my brother gave his life to protect her,' she explained, adding 
'there are lots of holes in the case. Lots of misinformation.'

Lora described how Hannah had stayed at her home just three weeks before the horrible events and that the girl weeping in TV interviews was 'certainly not the girl who stayed at my home.'

'I remember telling my brother "she is trouble, watch out for that one,"' she said on CNN's Piers Morgan Live on Tuesday night. 'She wasn't very gracious and was wearing very heavy eye make up.'

Lora added her 
brother had told her Hannah was 'very upset' her mother and 'she blamed 
her mother for her father moving to Tennessee.'

She described DiMaggio as 'one of the kindest people you've ever met' and said a troubled childhood brought the two together.

'He was my best friend, my brother, father, the person I would call for advice in life, love and everything,' she said, insisting that the authorities had not contacted her and would not return her calls asking for more information.

'The only fact is that some bodies were found on
his property,' she said. 'If there is evidence, as his only living 
family member, I think they could share a little bit of that with me.'

The interview comes days after Hannah Anderson's mother and young brother were laid to rest.

The service last Saturday for Christina Anderson and eight-year-old
Ethan Anderson at the Guardian Angels Roman Catholic Church in Santee was open
to the public.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Reverend Kevin Casey told
the memorial gathering that the community was 'touched by this evil and we can
never be the same again.'

Guardian Angel Roman Catholic Church 
in Santee made arrangements to accommodate more than 1,000 mourners for the two slain residents.

Before the start of the service, Hannah Anderson 16, and her family greeted mourners and embraced family and friends.

Hannah,
dressed in a black and white outfit with a Starbucks iced coffee in 
hand, was pictured positioning a photo of her mother and brother and 
weeping as she stood behind the easel.

'We
are here to pray for Tina and remember her and for Ethan. Ethan doesn't
need prayers. He is already an angel in heaven. And that is our great 
belief,' Father Kevin Casey said at the opening of the service, CNN reported.

'We are touched by this evil and we can never be the same again,' the cleric told the assembled congregants.

Authorities have declined to discuss a
possible motive in the deaths and haven't addressed other details of 
the case, including how Hannah was treated by DiMaggio during the 
ordeal.

Investigators have said DiMaggio set fire to his home using a timer, giving him a 20-hour jump on law enforcement.

It was reported that DiMaggio's sister had requested paternity tests to determine if the suspect fathered the children, however she denied this to Piers Morgan.

Hannah's father, Brett Anderson, gave his DNA to investigators to confirm Ethan's identity.

DiMaggio
named Hannah's grandmother, Bernice Anderson, as the sole beneficiary 
of his employer-issued life insurance policy, making her eligible to 
receive $112,000.

During an 
emotional interview on the Today Show last week, Hannah offered more 
details of her relationship with DiMaggio, whom she called 'Uncle Joe.'

The
teen tearfully defended herself over letters and texts she had sent to 
her kidnapper, saying that the 13 messages the two exchanged on the day 
of her abduction were regarding arrangements to pick her up from cheer 
camp.

Authorities have also said that letters from Anderson were found at the home.

Hannah said that they were written about a year ago when she was having trouble getting along with her mother and she sought advice from DiMaggio.

The girl broke down in tears when talking about her slain brother and mother. 

'He had a really big heart,' Anderson said of Ethan, adding that her mother was 'strong-hearted and very tough.'
