Police in Russia are tracking a gang - apparently including a doctor - who drugged a TV soap actor and removed his testicles.

Dmitry Nikolaev, 30, had a drink with a 'young blonde woman' who approached him at a bar after he finished a performance at a small Moscow theatre.

Flirting with him, she invited him to a sauna, and though he was married, he agreed to go with her.

Dmitry Nikolaev, a married TV actor whose testicles were removed by a gang after he was apparently drugged in a bar in Moscow 

'They kissed and had some more beer and after that the actor remembers nothing,' said a police source.

He woke up next day at a bus stop, feeling acute pain, and with blood on his trousers.

Rushed to hospital, he was told that his testicles had been removed and that 'it was done like proper surgery by someone with a medical education'.

The operation was conducted in a 'skillful way', said police, who believe his beer was spiked by an unknown drug.

Mr Nikolaev only realised that his testicles had been removed when he woke up at a bus stop in acute pain with blood all over his trousers 

They fear a gang seeking to sell human organs on the black market.

The actor, now working as a children's animator, was too embarrassed at first to explain what had happened to his wife, said media reports.

Russia's Life News carried exclusive pictures of the victim in hospital.
