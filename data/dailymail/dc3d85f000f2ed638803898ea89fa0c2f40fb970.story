Japanese car giant  Nissan is recalling half a million of  British--built Micra super-minis  over a fault that can cause the steering-wheel to come off in the driver’s hand.

The recall affects 133,869 Sunderland-built Nissan Micras sold  in the UK between December 2002 and May 2006.

But it is part of a wider worldwide recall of 841,000 Micras of which 576,000 were built at the Sunderland factory.

Nissan Micra models rolling off the production line at Nissan's plant in Sunderland: The Japanese giant is recalling half a million British-built Micras over a fault that can cause the steering-wheel to come off in the driver¿s hand

A Nissan Motor GB spokesman said: 'Over time, the nut that holds on the steering wheel can become loose.

'Drivers could start notice some wobbling of the wheel and if this is ignored there is the possibility that it could come completely off.’

The spokesman said steering wheels had come off in the hands of drivers in Japan,  but none in this country.

He added: ‘There have been a few incidents of steering wheels becoming loose, but there have been no accidents.’

A Nissan spokesperson said: 'Drivers could start notice some wobbling of the wheel and if this is ignored there is the possibility that it could come completely off.¿

In a statement  the Japanese car firm  said: ‘Nissan is writing to owners of its Micra models built between 2nd December 2002 and 12th May 2006 asking them to take their car to a Nissan dealer for a free check to ensure the steering wheel securing bolt is tightened sufficiently.

‘In some cases the steering wheel securing nut has gradually become loose.

'This would soon become apparent to the driver and there is no risk of a sudden failure, but if left unchecked this could eventually lead to the steering column being damaged. ‘

The firm added: ‘The check will take less than 15 minutes at a dealer.’
