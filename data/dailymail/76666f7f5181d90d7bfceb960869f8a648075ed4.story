Every politician loves a photo opportunity.

But Cabinet minister Eric Pickles has been snapped with Las Vegas showgirls, on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and admiring the Golden Gate Bridge - without leaving his Whitehall office.

Students James Johnson and Daniel Falvey took a cardboard cut out of the larger-than-life Communities Secretary on a road trip from Florida to Nevada and posted their holiday snaps online.

High flier: The safety conscious minister was seen wearing a life jacket and headphones on a Virgin America flight from San Francisco to Las Vegas

Cooling off: 'Eric' poses in a shower at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas and was later snapped 'checking on the LA traffic'

Clutching a large brown leather bag and wearing a poppy, 'Eric' has become an internet hit on PicklesRoadTrip.com.

Starting on Miami Beach on August 24, the James and Daniel flew and drove their way across the United States, taking pictures of their carboard companion.

Mr Pickles was so delighted with the results he posed with the cutout when the pair visited the House of Commons.

The trip began in Florida, before taking in Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California before finishing up in Las Vegas, Nevada earlier this month.

Along the way 'Eric' is seen lying on a sunbed, sitting on a swing, posing with a cop and a horse, behind the wheel of a campervan and proving that 'bicep curls get the girls' on Muscle Beach, California.

James and Daniel insist they are huge fans of Mr Pickles. Writing on their blog, they said: 'We are two British undergraduates, 
currently both at university in the UK.

'This summer, we are taking a 
coast-to-coast road trip across the American South and felt that there 
was no one better to accompany us than the Secretary of State for Local 
Communities and Government, the Rt Hon Eric Pickles MP.

'As Conservatives and huge fans of Mr. 
Pickles, his outlook and his work to modernise and maximise value in our
public services, we hope this blog goes some way to document the great 
manâ€™s adventures across the land of our great Atlantic neighbour.'

Sunseeker: Wearing shades but still clutching his bag, 'Eric' soaks up some sun in Imperial Dunes, California

The pictures were cloesley followed by Mr Pickles, who agreed to meet the students in Westminster when the Commons returned from the conference season.

While the pair and carboard 'Eric' had been enjoying the sun of the southern states, the real Mr Pickles had been holed up in a conference centre in Manchester.

Clearly delighted with his new found fame, Mr Pickles tweeted a picture of himself with the cut out with the message: 'United in Westminster.'
