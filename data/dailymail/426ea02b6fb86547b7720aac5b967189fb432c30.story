Manchester United beat relegation threatened Sunderland at Old Trafford thanks to a second half double from England international Wayne Rooney.

Rooney opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 66th minute before doubling the hosts lead with just six minutes left.

Sunderland had defender Wes Brown wrongfully sent off during the game as the former Manchester United defender wrongly took the flak for a poor John O'Shea foul.

Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates every player's performance at Old Trafford

MANCHESTER UTD (4-2-3-1)

David de Gea 6 – Little more than a spectator for the most part but pulled off a smart save from Wickham early on.

Antonio Valencia 6.5 – Solid in defence, purposeful going forward. A good performance without setting the world alight.

Chris Smalling 6 – Got forward a few times to launch United attacks in the absence of much creativity from his midfielders. 

Jonny Evans 5 – Booed on a couple of occasions by the United fans for passing back to his goalkeeper and needs to be a little more positive, even for a centre-back.

Marcos Rojo 6 – Kept Adam Johnson quiet down the Sunderland right and made one vital interception to deny the former England man in the first half.

Ander Herrera 5.5 – Played alongside Blind at the base of a 4-2-3-1 but made very little impact on the game. Had a goal ruled out for offside towards the end.

Daley Blind 6.5 – Usual competent, tidy job from the Dutchman. Tested Pantilimon with a decent effort from range in the second half.

Angel di Maria 4 – His worst performance for United yet. Took the wrong option time and again, and not one of his tricks came off. Hooked at half-time.

Wayne Rooney 7.5 – United skipper had to be happy with a deeper role again, but lifted his side from a lethargic performance by scoring both goals.

Ashley Young 6.5 – United’s biggest threat in the first half and was unlucky to see one goalbound effort deflected against the underside of the bar.

Radamel Falcao 6 – Earned the penalty for United and an ovation from the fans when he was subbed immediately afterwards. Plenty of effort from the Colombian bit the cutting edge is still lacking.

SUNDERLAND (4-1-4-1)

Costel Pantilimon 6 – Not tested nearly enough in the first half. Made some good saves after the interval and had no chance with the penalty.

Anthony Reveillere 5.5 – Had his hands full against Ashley Young and struggled at times.

John O’Shea 5 – Enjoyed a large slice of luck on his return to Old Trafford, diverting a Young effort against the underside of the bar and escaping a red card for fouling Falcao. 

Wes Brown 6 – Former United man did a good marking job on Falcao and was very unfortunate to be sent off for fouling the Colombian when the guilty man was teammate John O’Shea.

Patrick van Aanholt 6 – Got forward a couple of times to send in searching crosses but pinned back for much of the game.

Lee Cattermole 6.5 – A key part of Sunderland’s defensive plan and made a couple of fantastic interceptions, including one on Young in the first half. 

Adam Johnson 5.5 – Upset the United fans with a clear dive and made little impression. Subbed towards the end.

Sebastien Larsson 6 – Had to be more defensive than usual and rescued his team with a goal-line clearance in the first half.

Jordi Gomez 5 – Former Wigan man produced very little of note, but this was not a day for Sunderland’s creative players. 

Connor Wickham 5.5 – Had Sunderland’s best chance when he broke forward from deep to test De Gea but struggled to make an impact after that and came off after 67 minutes.

Jermain Defoe 6 – Lively in the first and pestered United’s back-four in a lonely role up front, but faded after half-time and subbed at the same time as Wickham
