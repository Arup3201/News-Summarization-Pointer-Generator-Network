Search efforts have been focused over the Java Sea, with objects and oil patches spotted in water inside the search zone on Monday but it could not be confirmed if this was the flight's wreckage.

According to his social media page, Mr Soetjipto - who is originally from Malang, Indonesia - lives in Melbourne and started studying at the university's Clayton campus in 2013. 

The student had recently travelled to New Zealand and photos showed he had an active social life, dining and taking trips to the beach with friends.
