Barcelona legend Johan Cruyff has branded the club’s record signing Neymar ‘a problem’ the day after president Josep Maria Bartomeu pledged to improve Lionel Messi’s contract and make him the world’s top earner.

'The problem that Barca have now is Neymar,' said the former Holland star. 'He is a great player, that is not in question but you cannot sign a 21-year-old and pay him more than players who have won everything there is to win. No-one is God when they are just 21 years old.'

The comments will further embarrass Barcelona who have long maintained that Neymar’s salary is below that of other established stars.

Ever since Neymar joined the club in the summer there have been whispers that the €40m sum paid to his parents company N&N was a way of paying the Brazilian a higher wage while avoiding upsetting the dressing room.

Cruyff’s comments, made in Kuala Lumpur at the Laureus awards, will sow the seeds of doubt again among the club’s supporters.

Neymar’s contract guarantees him a wage of just under €11m a year well below the €17m that Messi earns and on a par with Barcelona’s second tier of top earners such as Andres Iniesta and Xavi.

But he also received an €8.5m signing on fee and if the €40m paid to N&N is divided over the five years of his contract his take home pay takes him close to Messi and well beyond Barca's Spain internationals who, as Cruyff points out, have won everything in the game.

Cruyff added: 'When you already have the best player in the world a player of just 21 years cannot be the big star – with 26 maybe but not at 21. It is a shame because Neymar is a great player  but if the situation continues like this things could go wrong.'

Cruyff, one of Barcelona’s greatest ever players who also managed their 'Dream Team' side that won the European Cup at Wembley in 1992, rarely holds back when asked about his former club and even more so since falling out with Sandro Rosell, the club’s president for most of this season until he stepped down.

Rosell even stripped Cruyff of an honorary president title bestowed on him by another former president Joan Laporta. He has also stopped going to the Nou Camp since Rosell replaced Laporta in 2010.

Cruyff famously said of Neymar when the club signed him: 'You cannot have two captains on one boat' hinting a possible clashes ahead between Brazil’s No 10 and Barca’s No 10 Messi.

Cruyff also spoke about the decision of Pep Guardiola to leave Barcelona. He said: 'Pep left Barca because the directors were interfering with his decisions.'
