The England squad played a prank on the team's masseur on Tuesday afternoon by 'treating' him to a quick dip in the ice bath.

Members of Roy Hodgson's squad, including Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson and Joe Hart, tied masseur Paul Small to a plastic chair before leading him towards the bath and throwing him in.

Captain Gerrard posted the clip to his Instagram account and said: 'All the lads wishing our masseur Smally a happy 50th birthday with a quick dip in the ice bath!'

Liverpool frontman Daniel Sturridge also recorded the prank and joked via his Instagram: 'Smally you got a phone on ya mate?'

Defender Johnson also tweeted a photo of the masseur tied up to the chair and said: 'Happy Birthday Smally!'

The Masseur, who also works for Liverpool, will have hopefully found the funny side having worked with Gerrard, Johnson and Sturridge since joining the Anfield side back in 2002.

The England squad appeared to be in high spirits ahead of Thursday's crunch Group D clash with Uruguay.

The Three Lions need to win to keep hopes of progressing alive having lost 2-1 to Italy in their World Cup opener on Saturday night.
