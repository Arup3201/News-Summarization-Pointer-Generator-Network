Barack Obama's move to open relations with Cuba brought an official weather forecast from Havana's state news agency that it would rain flower petals, but Cuban-Americans serving in the U.S. Senate unleashed a stormy tempest on the White House Wednesday.

The president made his shocking and historic announcement armed with a new budget that seems to cement the State Department's ability to fund an embassy and pay salaries in Havana.

But while two Republicans threatened action when the new GOP-led Congress convenes, they were led by a Democrat who has backed the White House on nearly everything for the last six years.

Complicating the saga, Hillary Clinton reportedly engineered the Cuba thaw when she was Obama's secretary of state, and she will likely be saddled with it in the 2016 White House race if the effort fails to move the island nation toward Democratic reforms.

New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez lashed out immediately, saying Obama'd decision to free three Cuban spies in exchange for U.S. aid worker Alan Gross had 'vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.'

BOWED, NOT BROKEN: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican son of Cuban emigres, said he would do everything in his power to block the president's new openness with the Castro regime

'Trading Mr. Gross for three convicted criminals sets an extremely dangerous precedent. It invites dictatorial and rogue regimes to use Americans serving overseas as bargaining chips' and will 'invite further belligerence toward Cuba’s opposition movement and the hardening of the government’s dictatorial hold on its people,' Menendez said.

Speaking of Obama's move to normalize diplomatic and trade relations with the communist dictatorship, he claimed 'the United States has just thrown the Cuban regime an economic lifeline.'

Menendez is the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

His GOP colleagues, Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, are also Cuban-Americans – and they threatened to stop the White House before its plan to open an embassy in Havana can gain traction.

Appearing on CNN, Rubio pledged to block the confirmation of any White House nominees to a new post of Ambassador to Cuba. 

'I reserve the right to do everything within the rules of the Senate to prevent that sort of individual from ever even coming up for a vote,' said Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants. 

On the Fox News Channel, he said Wednesday was 'a terrible day for democracy. It's a sad day for those that want freedom and liberty for the Cuban people.'

Alex Conant, Rubio's chief spokesman, told MailOnline that the senator is still exploring practical avenues to block the president, through both the confirmation process and Congress' power of the purse.

'We're looking into those questions ourselves,' he replied to questions about what Republicans might practically do. 

'But I don’t see how a nominee to be ambassador to Cuba gets confirmed in the Senate next year.'

In the past, any single U.S. senator could block a floor vote on a presidential nomination and force the nominee's advocates to come up with 60 votes to override his or her action.

But through outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry's Reid's use of what Washington wags called the 'nuclear option,' a simple majority is now all that's needed to approve a presidential appointee.

Even so, with Republicans holding 54 seats in the Senate that will open for business in January – and some Democrats angry about Obama's new Cuba policy – actually confirming a nominee could be impossible.

Cruz speculated on CNN about Senate action that could block the resumption of diplomatic and trade relations with Havana. 

'It's not clear at this point where the votes will be, but I expect in the Senate to see a far more vigorous voice defending our national security interests,' he said.

'And I am hopeful that we will prevent a bad deal and a bad decision. The point I was making on this, there’s a reason why I expect to see bi-partisan cooperation to rein this in. In 2009, the appeasement of Putin didn't work and Putin invaded Ukraine a sovereign nation.'

It's unclear what else Congress could do, but some political operatives are buzzing about the power of the purse. Lawmakers approve the money spent by federal agencies, including the State Department.

But Obama announced his Havana shift while his signature on a new federal budget was just days old. That document may stymie Senate dissenters who just last week would have forbidden Secretary of State John Kerry from spending money on a new Havana embassy and on salaries to staff it.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest thumbed his nose at them during a press briefing on Wednesday, suggesting that the administration already has the funds it needs to follow through on the president's televised announcement since U.S. personnel have been on the ground there for some time.

'As a point of fact, it’s not clear to me that additional appropriations will be necessary to establish an embassy in Cuba,' Earnest said, 'principally because there is already a significant diplomatic presence in Cuba.'

'There is an Interests Section there that represents the interests of the United States. So I don’t know of any specific appropriations request that has been made. There may be one in the future. We'll see.'

Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, the Judiciary Committee's outgoing chairman and one of the lawmakers who accompanied Gross back to the U.S. on Wednesday, said it would be 'really, really foolish' to normalize relations with Cuba while no ambassador is in place. 

And Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who has tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to rally support behind legislation to change U.S.-Cuba policy,said 'it would be really counterproductive to block funding for an embassy.'

'We're going to have a lot more Americans traveling to Cuba. … To tell those Americans who travel there, you're out of luck if you have a problem, I just don't think that's right.

BOLD: Obama surprised Washington and the world by announcing that he would scrap the 53-year-old policy of detachment from the communist country of Cuba

However U.S-Cuba relations sort out, Hillary Clinton will get much of the credit or blame. 

From 2009 until her departure early last year, then-Secretary of State Clinton took the lead when the Obama administration interfaced with Cuban officials, according to Bloomberg News.

White House and State Department officials and others told Bloomberg that Clinton pushed hard for the administration to end the half-century-old bans on tourism and trade with the island communist state.

While some in the White House resisted her pressure, her brainchild ultimately came to fruition this week.

'Hillary Clinton played a very large role,' New America Foundation senior fellow Steve Clemons told the news outlet.

'Cuba was on her mind,' he said, referring to her final year in office. 'I know that she raised it a number of times. The White House wasn’t ready to move but she kept that in play.'

And Arturo Valenzuela, then assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs and Clinton's top Cuba-policy aide, said 'there was strong support in the State Department for liberalizing some of the restrictions and Secretary Clinton was quite clear about that.' 

Trade relations with the island dictatorship just 90 miles from Florida are governed by the  1996 Helms-Burton Act, which strengthening the trade embargo first put in place by President John F. Kennedy.

Only Congress can overturn that law – a near-impossibility with strong GOP majorities in both houses when the 114th Congress convenes just weeks from now.

But GOP leaders seem to concede that nothing Obama promised on Wednesday goes beyond what Helms-Burton permits.

'It's not like he's thrown the door open to Cuban cigars coming into Florida and Chevrolets going to Havana,' an aide to a senior House Republican told DailyMail.com.

'But the danger, now that Obama has moved the goalposts, is what the next Democratic administration and the next Democratic Congress could do. And the next. And the next.'
