Plot: Joanne Berry, 30, , pictured today at Maidstone Crown Court, posed as a woman with a sex fantasy and sent a man to her colleagues house with instructions to 'burst in' and rape her

A woman who used a sex chatroom to send a stranger to rape a colleague in her home has been jailed for six years.

Joanne Berry, 30, posed on sex sites as a woman with a rape fantasy - but gave the men she spoke to the address and details of her colleague instead, a court heard.

She told a man, Dean Hicks, to knock on the front door of the woman, who cannot be named, then burst in and rape her.

Mr Hicks went to the address thinking the woman would share his fantasy, but realised there had been a mistake and told her to call the police.

The jury at Maidstone Crown Court in Kent heard that the woman had been giving Berry emotional support, and was being texted by her as much as 12 times a day.

But her demands became too much, and the woman told Berry to stop. Days later Mr Hicks appeared at her door.

Berry was found guilty of  four offences, including common assault and attempting to force penetrative sex upon the victim, at a hearing in May.

Jailing her today, Judge David Griffith-Jones QC said: ''You underwent these offences in a wicked and calculated albeit frankly bizarre fashion. Your victim happened to be a work colleague.

'She had been kind to you when you confided in her about some personal matters and some hardships.

'Dr Hussain, a consultant psychiatrist, decided you were fragile and psychologically vulnerable with a low self-esteem, but that you had no mental illness and no psychiatric history.

'It is to be noted that the word 'bizarre' features regularly in my sentencing. It is highly unlikely that the counsel had anything like this in mind when they wrote the guidelines.

'By the seriousness of these offences taking account the totality of the criminality, I impose the shortest sentence I feel I possibly can. That sentence is a sentence of six years imprisonment.'

The judge said Berry was in denial throughout proceedings, and that it was only by chance that the victim had not actually been raped. 

Prosecutor Andrew Espley said: 'Joanne Berry arranged for men to go round to [the victim's] house and rape her.

'How did she do it? She went on various sex chat websites. She pretended she was [the victim], she gave [the victim's] address, she used her name, she gave the registration of her car which was going to be parked outside, pretended to be her.

'She then told the men to come round and engage in a fantasy rape game with her, basically to rape her.'

The court heard how Berry confided in the victim with her personal problems. In April 2012, when Berry texted her, implying she was about to kill herself, the victim decided to alert the police and give them Berry's phone number.

However, Berry refused to give the police her correct details, causing the victim to believe she was 'attention-seeking'.

She asked Berry not to contact her any more, and begged her to seek professional help because 'she was making her angry and frightened'.

Mr Espley said the victim later received a series of texts from Berry saying that 'she had thought she could trust her and now she had lost her job and lost her as a friend'.

A few days later Berry sent Dean Hicks to the victim's address in Kent. When Mr Hicks realised there was a mix-up and the victim had not been expecting him, he told her to call the police and he spoke to officers about what had happened, including the online messages he had received.

Berry, an office temp worker, was arrested at her home in Lewisham, south London on May 27, 2012.

Police found a large number of chat line posts with numerous men on her laptop which contained 'unpleasant sexual content' and referred to the victim's address.

On May 14 Berry was convicted with putting the victim in fear of violence, committing an offence of assault with the intent of committing a relevant sexual offence, the common assault of the victim and attempting to cause the victim to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.

She will serve up to half and will then be released on license. She was also told to sign the sex offenders' resigster, and will be banned from working with children for life.
