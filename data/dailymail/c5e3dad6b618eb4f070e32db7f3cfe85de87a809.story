The two people who died after being struck by a freight train at  a level crossing in apparent suicide pact were today named as an elderly married couple who lived nearby.

Peter Smith, 80, and Betty Evelyn Smith, 79, were killed instantly just before noon yesterday near the Allenby Estates unmanned level crossing close to their home in Cherry Willingham, Lincolnshire.

The couple were said to have walked onto the railway line in the village near Lincoln, straight into the path of the 60mph freight train - ignoring the warning horn sounded by the driver of the engine.

Probe: Officers and rail workers at the scene of the incident where British Transport Police are investigating

Their family said in a statement 
released through police today: ‘We are deeply saddened by our loss and 
we would now like to ask for privacy while we come to terms with what 
has happened.’

British 
Transport Police said its officers were working to establish the full 
circumstances of the incident, which is currently being treated as 
non-suspicious.

Witnesses 
told how the train driver sounded the horn for at least a minute on the 
approach to the crossing. This morning a floral tribute was placed close
 to where the tragedy occurred.

Neighbours
 of the couple paid tribute to the ‘beautiful’ and ‘devoted’ couple who 
had lived in the village for over 50 years – adding that they had both 
seemed very happy and in good health.

Mr Smith was said to have been a postmaster, who retired after a car crash 20 years ago, while Mrs Smith had never worked.

Joyce
 Garner, 94, who lives two doors down from the couple’s home, said: ‘I 
just can’t believe it. They used to have dogs up until a few years ago 
and I would see them walking them every day.

‘Peter had to retire early from his 
job as a postman more than 20 years ago after a car crash, but Betty was
 always in the garden and he would try and help where he could.’

Margaret
 Elkington, 81, who has lived on their road for 38 years, added: ‘They 
seemed to be such a happy couple. They would catch the bus into Lincoln 
every Monday and Saturday.

‘I
 spoke to them on this last Monday about the weather while they waited 
for the bus and they were fine. They had a daughter but they didn’t 
speak about her very much.’

Neighbour
 Jack Haggar, 83, said: ‘They were very pleasant but a family which kept
 themselves to themselves. Peter and Betty always stopped to speak. It 
has come as a terrible shock.’

Local butcher Derek Wilkinson, 59, said he had known the couple for 50 years.

He
 added: ‘Peter and Betty were very private people and they’d lived in 
the village for as long as I can remember. They were regular customers 
of mine and came in every week.

Response: East Midlands Ambulance Service workers attended and both people were pronounced dead

Further back: Emergency services worked to put up screens to shield local schoolchildren from the scene

‘Peter
 would come in and buy their Sunday roasts and their meat for their 
midweek meals including chops and sausages. Peter used to do the 
shopping. I think that they will both be very sadly missed.’

The
 Rail Accident Investigation Branch has been informed and the Central 
Lincolnshire Coroner is expected to open inquests in the next few days.

The
 train - which was heading for Immingham Docks in North Lincoln - was 
brought to a halt at a second level crossing in the village and just 
600ft from a secondary school holding its sports day.

Emergency
 services worked to put up screens to shield the schoolchildren from the
 scene, and staff had to arrange for pupils to take alternative routes 
home.

The user-worked 
crossing consists of a 12ft wide metal gate. Drivers have to ring 
through to the main signal box for clearance to open the gates and cross
 but pedestrians can walk across via a stile.

East
 Midlands Ambulance Service pronounced both people dead at the scene. 
Passenger services between Lincoln and Grimsby were halted for three 
hours before resuming later in the afternoon.

Stoppages: Services between Grimsby and Lincoln have been affected and parts of the line have been suspended

Investigation: The incident just before midday is being treated by British Transport Police as 'non-suspicious'

Local
 resident Tony Pick, 68, a retired civil engineer, said yesterday: 'I 
came back home just seconds before the ambulances arrived and it was 
then I noticed a body lying 100 yards down the track.

'It
 was an elderly woman as far as I could tell. It's very shocking as you 
don't really get anything like this happen around here. It is a quiet 
area.'

Plumber Mark Daykin was working 200 yards from where the initial impact is said to have happened.

'We are deeply saddened by our loss and we would now like to ask for privacy while we come to terms with what has happened'

Family of Peter and Betty Evelyn Smith

He
 said: ‘I was working with my boss and we heard the train beep. The 
driver really gave it the whole horn. We went down to the foot crossing.
 It looked as though the impact had been there.

‘There
 were no emergency services there yet and we walked further down the 
line towards the railway bridge where there was blood on the track.

‘It
 looked as though the train carried on further down the line. We left 
when the fire service arrived and said it wasn't a very nice scene down 
there.’

And former military 
policeman Mike Barker, 67, said: ‘I was out for a walk when I heard the 
sirens and then we saw the freight train on the level crossing.

‘An
 ambulance was already there. We heard that two people had been killed 
further down the line towards Lincoln and this is where the train ended 
up.

Location: The incident happened just before midday at the footpath near this level crossing (file picture)

‘There is a school and 
two old people's homes on the street and it can take quite a while to 
walk across the crossing if you're not fit.’

A BTP spokesman said yesterday: ‘Our officers are currently in attendance at a level crossing in Croft Lane, Cherry Willingham, where two people have been struck by a train. The incident was reported to BTP at 11.57am on July 9 and colleagues from Lincolnshire Police are also on scene.

‘Medics from the East Midlands Ambulance Service are in attendance and both people have been pronounced dead at the scene. Officers are now working to establish the full circumstances of the incident, which is currently being treated as non-suspicious.’

Cherry
 Willingham, a village of around 3,600 people, is around four miles east
 of Lincoln. It does not have a train station, but sits on the railway 
line between Lincoln and Market Rasen.

The Smith couple lived in a bungalow on a road with an average house value of £200,000.

Recent
 official safety figures revealed that the number of deaths from 
trespass and suicide on the railways rose from 278 to 300 in 2013/14 - 
the highest annual figure recorded.

It
 is thought that this number would have been even higher but for the 
partnership, recently renewed for another five years, between Network 
Rail and Samaritans.
