Education Secretary Michael Gove has branded the long summer holiday a relic of the 19th century, when children were needed to help on farms

The six-week school summer holiday could be scrapped because head teachers think it makes terms too long.

Most are in favour of spreading holidays more evenly throughout the year to ease pressure on staff.

Leaders of the National Association of Head Teachers said spacing breaks across the year – and adopting different patterns around the country – would also bring down family holiday prices, which soar in the peak summer season.

A total of 55 per cent of NAHT members polled are in favour of overhauling term structures.

The union, which represents 28,000 heads and deputies, will now conduct research into the impact of the long summer break on children’s learning before adopting the change as a policy.

The move, discussed at the NAHT’s annual conference in Birmingham at the weekend, is the furthest any classroom union has gone towards endorsing a reduction in the six-week summer break.

It is widely viewed as sacrosanct by teachers, but Education Secretary Michael Gove has branded it a relic of the 19th century, when children were needed to help on farms.

He will allow all state schools to alter their term dates from next year.

Schools that govern their own admissions, such as academies, can already do so, but only a few have made radical changes.

One is Nottingham’s Djanogly City Academy, which has five terms of eight weeks separated by two-week holidays, and a four- or five-week summer break.

Russell Hobby, the NAHT general secretary, admitted the proposal for shorter but more frequent holidays would be controversial in the teaching profession.

However, he said American research suggested children suffered ‘learning loss’ during a long summer break.

Mr Hobby added: ‘It seems like at the end of term everybody’s ready to drop.

'Not reducing the amount of holiday but distributing it more evenly across the year might be one solution to that.’ 

Having different times off around the country would also reduce the price premium added by travel companies as demand surges during school holidays.

Mr Hobby said: ‘It would be good for the parents of children, it would be good for attendance because it would take away some of the excuses, and it would be good for teachers as well.’ 

However, some NAHT members oppose the move. Stephen Watkins, head of Mill Field Primary School in Leeds, said that, in effect, most teachers had only four weeks off over summer as they spent two weeks preparing for the new term.

He added that there should be a ‘time where children need to be children and have time to play’.An American review of 39 studies in 1996 found that some researchers estimated that pupils lost between one and three months of learning over the summer.

The problem was more marked in maths than reading, with disadvantaged pupils affected more than others.

Heads at the conference also pledged to press for Mr Gove’s reforms of GCSEs and A-levels to be overturned, saying they will wreak ‘incalculable’ damage on children’s education.

They are furious that coursework is being axed in most subjects in favour of written exams after two-year courses.

Alan Mottershead, head of Trinity School in Carlisle, said exams were at risk of becoming ‘a feat of memory recall’.

Rob Campbell, head of Impington Village College in Cambridge, said: ‘I cannot believe parents will want their children assessed exclusively by terminal exam, a once-and-only sitting of an exam at the end of a course.’ 

Delegates unanimously passed a resolution calling for an urgent rethink of the changes, to be phased in from next year.

The Department for Education rejected the criticisms, saying the reforms would ‘address the pernicious damage caused by grade inflation and dumbing down’.
