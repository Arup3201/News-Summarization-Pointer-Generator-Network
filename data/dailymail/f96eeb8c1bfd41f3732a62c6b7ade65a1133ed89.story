Calm first, but then crying: James, eight, was hailed a hero by his family after he saved his father's life by switching off the machine and run for help

A quick-thinking eight year old has been hailed a hero after saving his father's life in a farm accident.

James Aspden came to the rescue of his dad Thomas, 52, when his arm became trapped in a hay-baling machine, which then began to pull him into the mechanism.

Mr Aspden's arm was dragged into the machine up to his shoulder as he tried to free a blockage, crushing the whole of his left limb.

But cool-headed James was able to 
calmly follow his stricken father's instructions to turn off the 
machine, using three different switches, and raise the alarm.

Mr Aspden said that without his son's actions he would almost certainly have been killed.

James, who has his own little tractor
 and regularly helps out on the farm, said: 'I pressed the button off 
and ran to mum and mum came over to the bailer then called the 
ambulance.'

The youngster, 
who hopes to follow in his dad's footsteps and take over the family farm
 one day, also described the experience as 'scary' and 'frightening'.

It took fire crews two hours to free the pig farmer when they arrived at the accident near Chorley, Lancashire.

Mr Aspden suffered five separate breaks to the limb and is now recovering in hospital after two operations

He was trapped so badly that there were initial fears that the arm would have to be amputated at the scene.

But he was taken to hospital where doctors were able to save his arm after two operations.

He suffered five separate breaks to the limb and is now recovering in hospital.

Relieved
 mum Thelma, 37, said: 'James was just a star. Thomas just thinks our 
son is marvellous, his quick thinking has saved his arm and his life. 
He's just so grateful.

'I think James was so brave in such a 
horrific situation to think to turn it off - most kids would have just 
stood there in shock but he remained calm and his actions have saved his
 dad.

'If the machine had been left on his arm would have been ripped off, or worse, he could have died.'

 said James, who is a pupil at Eccleston St Mary's Primary School, ran 
screaming towards her for help after disabling the hay baling machine.

'I was on the other side of the field on one tractor and Thomas and James were in the other tractor baling.

'The first thing I knew was when James had run across the field to get me. I looked up and could see Thomas was on top of the baler with his arm trapped inside.

'As I got closer I could see that bones were sticking out and blood was everywhere - after a while I don't think Thomas could feel anything. I had to feel around in his pocket for his mobile phone - mine was out of battery. He was slipping in and out of consciousness, it was very worrying,' she added.

She said Mr Aspden had got into difficulties after netting had become tangled in the hay baling machinery. When he tried to free it, his arm was pulled in.

The air ambulance, fire engines and paramedics arrived at the scene and it was at first feared that the only way to free him would be to cut off his arm.

Mrs Aspden said: 'At one point he got really upset when he heard the firefighter suggest cutting his arm off to free him, but thankfully they managed to avoid that option. Thomas knows the machine inside and out so was able to help them cut through and release him. As soon as he was set free Thomas passed out and started shaking.'

Mr Aspden was flown to Royal Preston Hospital where he underwent surgery on the arm, which was found to be broken in five places.

Thelma, James and his sister Abigail, 18, have been by his bedside since the incident last Thursday.

'He hopes to be out within a week. His arm is in a big cast and he is just hoping he can get the feeling back in his fingers.'

Abigail added: 'James stopped the machine from working and went to get help. He's amazing. I think he should get an award for this.

'He was calm at first but afterwards he was crying. I got him to a neighbour as quickly as possible to get him away from the situation.

'He couldn't have done any better, it was quick reaction.'
