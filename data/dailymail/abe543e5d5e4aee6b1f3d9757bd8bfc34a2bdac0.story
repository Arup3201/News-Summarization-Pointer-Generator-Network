US authorities have relaunched their probe into British bank Standard Chartered's breaking of sanctions on Iran, sending the company's share price tumbling.

The London-based firm has already been fined almost £1billion (£620million) after it was found to have helped hide or disguise the identity of Iranian clients in billions of dollars worth of wire transfers.

But authorities today re-launched their investigation to determine whether the bank had withheld key information about the true extent of their illegal dealings 

Share drop:  US authorities have relaunched their probe into British bank Standard Chartered's breaking of sanctions on Iran

According to a report in the New York Times, regulators investigating another bank uncovered evidence of transactions that Standard Chartered had not disclosed.

Shares slumped three per cent to a five year low on Thursday morning, as fears were raised that the bank could be hit with further penalties.

The firm's profits had already fallen 16 per cent to £950m in the three months to the end of September, although income rose 1 per cent to £2.8bn

In its latest bid to get back on track Standard Chartered pledged to cut costs by £250m next year.

The spluttering performance of Standard Chartered has tested the patience of its investors who have grown used to success.
