The most dramatic and insightful details of the hostage crisis unfolding in Sydney are being revealed minute by minute as a journalist live tweets his eyewitness account from his office across the street.

'The lights have gone out...You can just make out the black extremist flag being held up in the window,' Seven Network reporter Chris Reason tweeted tonight, as he revealed dramatic details of the situation.  

Reason, who was so close he could see the redness in the hostage's eyes as they sobbed, this evening labelled it 'an awful thing to witness'.

Reason has taken to Twitter to provide live updates of the hostage crisis, and was so close he could even see the man believed to be the mastermind behind the situation

'We can see the faces of hostages - pained, strained, eyes red and raw,' he tweeted, noting that one of the hostages had their 'head in their hands'.  

Reason provided fresh details about the man believed to be the mastermind of the crisis: 'Gunman is clear - white shirt, black cap, unshaven, holds poss pump action shotgun.'

Coming 'from inside the Martin Place newsroom', the journalist confirmed that there are approximately 10 people still trapped inside, following the escape of five hostages from the tense situation and reported that there are no children inside. 

'It's not the number 50 being bounced around earlier this morning. We're talking old young female. The youngest probably in early 20s. No children thankfully. No children in there. But still, just what an ordeal,' Reason told ABC Radio.

Reason has been live tweeting his view since approximately 6pm on Monday evening

Around 6pm, Reason reported seeing the gunman rotating hostages through stints standing in the windows of the store, sometimes standing for two hours at a time.

The gunman became enraged when his captives bolted out of the small Sydney cafe this afternoon, Reason reported.  

'The gunman became extremely agitated and started shouting (the moment they escaped). I'm assuming that, I must confess,' Reason said.  

'They would have all been a bit more calm, hands on heads (if they had been let go). This was a sheer bolt for freedom.'

One former hostage has been taken to hospital, while one of the Lindt cafe workers and another young male of Caucasian appearance are in the process of reuniting with their distressed families.

Reason, who was so close he could see the redness in the hostage's eyes as they sobbed, this evening labelled it 'an awful thing to witness'

Of one woman he saw from his vantage point, Reason reported seeing 'her hands (were) up against the window we could see clearly her face. Her eyes were red raw. 

'She had been obviously and understandably crying for a long time. She looked in pain, she looked in doubt. It was an awful thing to witness...'.

Around 6pm, Reason reported seeing the gunman rotating hostages through stints standing in the windows of the store, sometimes standing for two hours at a time.  

Afterwards, he spotted food being brought inside for the hostages from the kitchen at the back of the store.  

Witnesses earlier described how a man, now believed to be the gunman, wearing a headband covered in Arabic walked into the cafe and produced a shotgun from a blue bag around 9.45am.

Throughout the day, hostages were seen with their hands pressed against the windows holding up the Islamic Shahada flag. 

The gunman also claimed he had 'two bombs inside the cafe' and two elsewhere in the city, according to Ten

Multiple media outlets, including the Ten Network and Radio 2UE, have received calls from hostages where the gunman has requested an Islamic State flag and a conversation with Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

The gunman also claimed he had 'two bombs inside the cafe' and two elsewhere in the city, according to Ten. Police have not confirmed his precise weaponry.

Deputy NSW Police Commissioner Catherine Burn said police were planning to 'work into the night' if need be.
