Fast & Furious actor Paul Walker did not die from the impact of the crash alone - he also burned alive, his death certificate has confirms.

The 40-year-old's official cause of death was given as the 'combined effects of traumatic and thermal injuries' by an LA County Coroner.

Walker's official 'Certificate of Death' was released to the public today for the first time.

The death certificate for the driver of the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT, Roger Rodas, says he died from 'multiple traumatic injuries' but does not mention burns as a factor.

Both documents, obtained by TMZ, reveal the men's deaths were 'rapid'.

Mr Walker and Mr Rodas were killed on November 30 when their Porsche lost control and burst into flames in Santa Clarita, Los Angeles, on their home from a charity event.

Rodas, 38, and Walker had to be positively identified through dental records because their bodies were so badly burned.

The cause of the crash is under investigation, but experts believe plastic road markers known as Botts' Dots may have caused the car to hydroplane and lose control.

to theÂ  actor at a Santa Barbara beach memorial on Sunday - one day 
after he was laid to rest at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

The star's 15-year-old daughter Meadow joined his 25-year-old brother Cody, his father and his mother as they laughed and remembered the actor the best way they could - by playing football and enjoying the warm weather.

Also beachside to reminisce about his life was Tyrese Gibson, who co-starred with Walker in the Fast & Furious franchise.
