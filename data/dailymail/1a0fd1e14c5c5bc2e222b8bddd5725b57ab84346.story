A runner in the Boston Marathon has spoken of the 'amazing' kindness of two bystanders who helped her in the aftermath of the bomb attack.

Footage of a sobbing Chrissy Meagher being helped away from the scene of the explosions spread across the internet in the hours following Monday's bloody attacks.

She says the two men who rushed to her aid as she was gripped by a panic attack and fears for her relatives stayed with her all afternoon to help her track down her family.

'They were amazing': Sobbing Christine Meagher 
with the stranger, called Anthony, who with his brother-in-law rushed to 
help her as she was gripped by a panic attack in the aftermath of the 
Boston bomb

Horror: Footage of sobbing Miss Meagher being 
helped away from the scene of the explosions spread across the internet in the hours following the bloody attacks in the Massachusetts city on Monday afternoon

'My world was collapsing': She says the two men 
who rushed to her aid as she was gripped by a panic attack and fears for
her relatives stayed with her all afternoon to help her track down her 
family

According to the latest official 
tally, 183 people were injured and three killed, including one boy who was just eight years old, in the terror attack on Monday afternoon.

Miss Meagher said that in the hours following the blasts she feared that her father, a finish line official, was also among the casualties.

'At the time, my world was collapsing because my dad was at the finish line and I was just coming round [to the final straight] and I heard this big explosion,' she told Fox News.

'I was just underneath the media bridge and I just saw everyone evacuating and going into panic and then the second bomb went off. It was even more scary and I just started to run.'

She told how she knocked over barriers marking the course and into the street, where police intercepted her and escorted her to safety. It was then that a bystander rushed to her aid, as seen in the images which have spread across America.Â 

Fears: Miss Meagher, right, with her sister Katy, who also ran in the marathon but was behind her when the bombs exploded. Their father, Tom, was unhurt in the blasts and also rushed to help others

'That scene was just me panicking,' Miss Meagher recalled. She told of her gratitude to the stranger who helped her.

'He was with me all afternoon. I was so panicked,' she said. 'His name is Anthony and [he and] his brother-in-law, they helped me through because at the time I didn't know where my family was.'

In the hours following the blast, the men never left her side, letting her use their cellphone to track down the rest of her family and make sure they were okay.

Miss Meagher's father, Tom, a finish-line coordinator, was unhurt and had himself rushed to the aid of runners injured and traumatized by the explosions.

Her sister, Katy, also interviewed by Fox, was some way back in the race, which had been halted by police.

New crime scene photographs of the remnants of the first bomb show that a pressure cooker was used in at least one of the deadly charges.

And photographs taken by a member of 
the public of the second bomb site before and after detonation show an 
orange and grey bag next to the barrier - right where the bomb appears 
to have gone off.

Possible evidence: A picture taken by investigators from Boston's Joint Terrorism Task Force shows the remains of what is believed to be one of the explosive devices which experts say were like home-made claymores

Bomb?: Photos sent to 7News by a viewer show a bag next to a mailbox by the barrier along the marathon route just before the explosion that left three dead at Boston Marathon on Monday

Shocking: Seconds after the bombs went off on Boylston Street there is no sign of the bag, the picture is blurred because of the graphic nature of the content

Detectives are now investigating the possibility that this bag contained the device that exploded with such devastating effect.

Another photograph from the scene of the terror attacks shows a shredded black, padded back-pack or duffel bag that would confirm numerous reports that the bomb was carried in a black bag.

It is being claimed the deadly devices used in the Boston bombing were designed to act like 'homemade claymores' - powerful, directional anti-personnel devices, sources familiar with the investigation told NBC News.
