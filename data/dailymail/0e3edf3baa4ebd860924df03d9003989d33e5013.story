It's an anniversary that won't be celebrated, but this week marks the 20th birthday of air tax.

And shockingly in that time, Air Passenger Duty (APD) has risen by 870 per cent, nine times faster than duties on wine, beer and petrol. 

Relentless rises in Air Passenger Duty mean that a family of four flying to a destination outside Europe will soon pay £284 in tax, compared with just £40 when the levy was introduced on November 1, 1994.

Relentless rises: Air tax has risen astronomically over the 20 years since its inception

Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways' parent company IAG, said: 'Twenty years on, APD has snowballed out of control and become a tax that works against people wanting to visit relatives and friends, go on holiday or grow their business to create jobs.

'APD is way out of line with both other indirect taxes in the UK and flight taxes in other countries. Globalisation has accelerated enormously in the last 20 years. This tax helps no-one in today's economic environment. We must call time on APD.'

Back in 1994 short-haul passengers paid £5 per person, and long-haul passengers £10. Now a 160 per cent increase has taken it up to £13 for short haul flights, while a long haul flight will come in at between £67-£93 in tax.

That seven-fold increase in APD has taken place while inflation has not even doubled over the same period.

APD, which is the highest aviation tax imposed anywhere in the world, has also hugely outstripped other UK taxes such as petrol duty, road tax, duties on alcohol and insurance premiums over the last two decades.

Ryanair believe the abolition of APD would create more flights and some 60,000 new jobs

A spokesperson for Ryanair told Mail Online Travel: 'APD is damaging for traffic, tourism and jobs, makes countries uncompetitive and hinders countries from reaching their full tourism potential. 

'Many European countries, including Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands, have scrapped APD after traffic declined at their airports and have since returned to growth. Indeed, in the six months since the Irish Government scrapped APD on April 1, over 1.1m additional customers have travelled through the five main Irish airports, with Ryanair contributing 60 per cent of this growth. 

'The UK Government should follow suit, as the abolition of APD would yield 0.46 per cent of the UK GDP in the first year and at least £16bn within three years, creating new flights and 60,000 new jobs.' 

Low-cost carriers such as easJet believe the abolition of Air Passenger Duty would boost the UK economy 

These sentiments are echoed by easyJet, who added: 'easyJet has long campaigned for the abolition of Air Passenger Duty because independent research shows that it would boost the UK economy and pay for itself by increasing revenues from other sources. 

'The UK has the highest air passenger taxes in the world. This has a negative impact on tourism, investment and business activity.' 

Annual Treasury revenue from APD is now nearly ten times as much as in the tax's first full year. In total, air passengers in the UK have paid more than £26 billion in APD since 1994.

Even on short-haul flights, APD has become a big proportion of the ticket price. The £26 APD payable per person on a return flight within the UK is frequently at least a quarter of the total fare.

According to City analysts PwC, abolition of APD would boost Britain's economic growth by 0.5 per cent within a year and lead to the creation of 60,000 new jobs without reducing the Treasury's net revenues.

Back in August, a Treasury spokesman said: 'The government has taken steps to reform Air Passenger Duty and at Budget 2014 announced changes which, from April 1, 2015, will abolish the two highest tax bands.

'The reforms will cut tax for millions of passengers travelling to emerging markets such as China, Brazil and India, and to places with historic ties to the UK such as south Asia and the Caribbean.

'In 2015-16, over 99 per cent of passengers will see a freeze or cut in APD.'
