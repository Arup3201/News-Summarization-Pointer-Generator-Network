England's record caps holder Peter Shilton is excited by striker Harry Kane and feels the national team 'need a lot more' like him.

Kane has been in tremendous form for Tottenham this season, scoring 29 goals in all competitions, and it took him just 79 seconds to open his England account against Lithuania on Friday night.

The 21-year-old is set to lead the line against Italy in Turin on Tuesday night and Shilton, who played 125 internationals, is impressed with what he has seen.

Harry Kane scored from the bench just seconds into his England debut, and Shilton called him 'exciting'

The Tottenham striker is set for his first start for England when they face Italy in Turin on Tuesday

'He is a very exciting home grown player,' he told BBC Radio 5 Live. 'He's what we are looking for and what we need a lot more of.

'But let's take it steady with him. International football is a big step up. He's playing tonight, an even bigger test.'

Kane is also set to take part in this summer's European Under-21 Championship and while Shilton would not go so far as former team-mate Gary Lineker, who said on Twitter on Monday 'If clubs try and pull their players out it would be a national disgrace', the 65-year-old agrees about the importance of the competition.

Kane is likely to start alongside Wayne Rooney, but Shilton says he should not be rushed

The Spurs star has scored 29 goals in all competitions this season, the leading English goalscorer

'Winning things is a great incentive, it boosts your confidence at whatever level it comes,' Shilton said. 

'I think the Under-21s is very important. To go and win a tournament like that would be great for the country.'
