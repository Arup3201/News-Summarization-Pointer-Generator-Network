An unlucky mum was given a Mother's Day surprise she'll never forget this year after her adoring toddler waved her card with such furious excitement it nearly blinded her.

Bhavna Ramji's eyelid was sliced open by two-year-old Dhruv at 6.30am on Sunday, forcing her to head to Leicester Royal Infirmary for treatment.

'I was in agony. I looked like I had been punched in the face', she said, adding: 'I know it sounds funny but I could have been blinded.

Accident: Bhavna Ramji with her son Dhruv, who waved her Mother's Day card enthusiastically and slashed her eye lid

Treatment: After to a pharmacy failed to help the 40-year-old was rushed to casualty at Leicester Royal Infirmary with the painful paper cut

'As it was Mother's Day my husband, Ashok, looked after him and they both surprised me with a card and present at about 6.30am.

'Dhruv was on our bed and I opened the card and the present, which was a lovely leather wallet.

'My little boy was so excited he started waving the card about and it was then that it cut me.'

It appears Bhavna is having a run of bad luck as last year she spent Mother's Day in bed after she got a two-day bout of food poisoning.

She said: 'I am hoping next year is a little less eventful and I might get to enjoy being pampered.'

After the card accident this year some cream from the local pharmacy failed to help, so the family headed to hospital at around 2pm.

Bhavna said she was seen within an hour by a nurse, who gave her antibiotics and eye drops, but she is still in so she went to see an optician.

When she rang work to say she was sick, her reason raised a few eyebrows.

She said: 'I had to tell them that I had my eye sliced open by my two-year-old son wielding my Mother's Day card.

'They did not believe me. When they did they could not stop laughing.

'I have been signed off all week because I need to rest the eye and stop it opening and aggravating the injury.

'My husband feels bad but I am glad my son is too young to know. I would not want him to feel awful.'
