Comedian Russell Brand has described the moment his jokes about Hugo Boss and its historical links to the Nazis disrupted the 'illusion of sophistication' at the GQ Men Of The Year Awards.

The comic, who was allegedly thrown out from the after-show party after he made the jibes, has said his jokes were 'not intended to herald a campaign to destroy' the fashion firm.

Brand joked about the German company, who had sponsored the show, for making uniforms for Hitler's regime.

Writing in The Guardian today, Brand has put forward his version of events and described the moment he could sense divisions forming in the room as he made the joke.

The comedian, who picked up the 'oracle' award at the GQ Men of the Year Awards, took to the stage after Boris Johnson at the event at the Royal Opera House in London last Tuesday.

The mayor, who received GQ magazine’s award for Politician of the Year, had allegedly made jokes regarding the chemical attacks and subsequent deaths in Syria during his acceptance speech.

After picking up his award Brand said: 'Glad to grace the stage where Boris Johnson has just made light of the use of chemical weapons in Syria.

'Meaning that GQ can now stand for genocide quips.

'I mention that only to make the next comment a bit lighter because if any of you know a little bit about history and fashion, you'll know Hugo Boss made the uniforms for the Nazis.

'But they did look f****** fantastic, lets face it, while they were killing people on the basis of their religion and sexuality.'

Writing in The Guardian, the comic says the jokes 'were not intended to herald a campaign to destroy' Hugo Boss, who he describes as 'an irrelevant menswear supplier with a double-dodgy history'.

He also describes how the comments appeared to disrupt the 'illusion of sophistication' at the event, before questioning why the event had been attended by the the Mayor of London as well as Foreign Secretary William Hague.

Commenting on the relationships between the government, the media and industry, Brand asks, 'if you can't criticise Hugo Boss at the GQ awards because they own the event do you think it is significant that energy companies donate to the Tory party?'

He goes on to say: 'When you take a breath and look away from the spectacle it's amazing how absurd it seems when you look back.'

According to The Sun, Brand was kicked out of the aftershow party in central London.

The comic took to Twitter to tell his fans about an exchange he said he had with the magazine's editor Dylan Jones, writing: 'GQ editor: What you did was very offensive to Hugo Boss.

'Me: What Hugo Boss did was very offensive to the Jews', which was accompanied by the hashtag '#nazitailor'.

The fashion firm backed the event to the tune of £250,000, and would no doubt have been left reeling by Brand's tirade which included him putting a finger under his nose to mimic Hitler's moustache and goose-stepping on stage.

It isn't the first time Brand has run into trouble at the annual bash. In 2006 he was involved in a row with Rod Stewart after telling guests at the event he had slept with his daughter Kimberly.

In 1999, GQ editor James Brown resigned after the magazine published a list of of the 200 most stylish men of the 20th century, which included the Nazis and Field Marshal Rommel alongside Humphrey Bogart and John F Kennedy.

During the awards last week Noel Gallagher, who was sat with Brand, also criticised William Hague, who presented an award, for being 'here with all the s*** going on around the world you should be sorting out'.
