The 2015 tennis season unofficially kicks off in Abu Dhabi on New Year's Day with Andy Murray one of six players taking part in the Mubadala World Tennis Championship.

The Brit takes his place in a star-studded line-up including world No 1 Novak Djokovic, 14-time Grand Slam winner Rafael Nadal and Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka.

Spaniards Feliciano Lopez and Nicolas Almagro complete the bill of players participating in the exhibition tournament, after they replaced French pair Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gael Monfils.

Murray will be keen to put a difficult year behind him and play himself into form ahead of the opening Grand Slam of the season.

After this low-key tournament, Murray represents GB with Heather Watson at the Hopman Cup in Perth, and then it is straight into the Australian Open, an event where he has an admirably consistent record.
