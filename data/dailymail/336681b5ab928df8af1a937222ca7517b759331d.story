A Utah police officer who killed his family and then himself in January had drugged and raped his wife while filming it five times in the past two years, a disturbing seven-month investigation into the slayings has revealed.

Joshua Boren used his Linden Police Department-issued handgun to shoot and kill his British wife, Kelly, their two children and his mother-in-law, also from the UK. He arranged the bodies of Hayley, 5, Jaden, 7, and their mom on the couple's bed and then shot himself dead next to them.

According to Spanish Fork Police investigation, released this week, the couple had exchanged several heated text messages the day before the murder-suicide, with both seemingly agreeing their 8-year marriage was over.

Kelly, from Northhampton, had moved to the U.S. where the children were at school, and her mother, Maire King, joined them.

Shortly before her death, Kelly Boren told her husband she would take the kids, prompting Joshua Boren to reply by text: 'Don't involve the kids, they are innocent'

'You (expletive) drugged and raped me,' Kelly Boren texted, followed by four more texts with only the word 'raped,' according to the report, obtained by the Deseret News.

'I hate my life because (of) you,' she texted. 'You killed a part of me.'

Investigators learned of the rapes, the latest of which was apparently in late 2013, through friends of the couple and Boren's therapist, who he's been seeing for sex addiction since the fall.

In a journal, which his therapist asked him to write, he listed his weaknesses, stating: 'I have a sex addiction,' 'I fantasize regularly about people I see,' 'I've always hated sex offenders and their behaviors,' and 'I fantasize about drugging and having sex with Kelly and other women regularly.'

His wife told the therapist that she hadn't reported the rape because she didn't want to ruin her husband's law enforcement career. She only discovered what had happened to her when she found the tapes in 2013, said Spanish Fork Police Lt. Matt Johnson.

However, detectives noted in the 
conclusion of their report that 'Word was starting to get out' about 
Josh drugging and raping Kelly, and that he may have felt like he was 
about to be reported, which would have resulted in loss of his job and 
prison time.

The 
investigation also revealed Boren was allegedly sexually abused as a boy and according to the report 
harbored a deep hatred for his mother because she didn't protect him.

The
 Deseret News reports that his father committed suicide when he was 
five, after which time his mom allegedly began seeing numerous men, one of whom 
molested him.

His 
therapist told police Boren spent a significant amount of time trying to
 get over his hatred of his mother and described him as a '3-year-old 
boy stuck in a big man's body.'

The
 report states that shortly before Boren ended his final shift for the 
police department, he Googled the terms 'America's most brutal serial 
killers' and 'narcissism.'

Just before 6 p.m. on January 16, Boren sent his last text message. It was to his mother, and it read: 'I hope you are having a good day. Have a long and healthy life.'

Josh and Kelly Boren had already been separated for some time when the slayings took place.

The night before she was killed, Kelly Boren brought up the alleged sexual assault again, texting the word 'rape' to her husband four times

 Boren brought up the alleged sexual assault again, texting the word 
'raped' to her husband four times, the documents show.

She wrote in another text: 'I don't want to live in fear and hate and anger.'

The
 next morning, Kelly Boren told her husband she would take the kids, 
prompting Joshua Boren to reply by text: 'Don't involve the kids, they 
are innocent.'

'Josh was a very troubled individual that felt like he was about to lose his wife and children,' police wrote in the report.

Boren had worked for the Lindon Police Department for only three months when the murder-suicide occurred. Before that, he was a Utah County sheriff's deputy for seven years, Johnson said.

He used the service weapon he was 
given for his duties as a Lindon police officer when he killed his 
family members and himself, authorities said.

Toxicology reports from the autopsy show he had no drugs or alcohol in his system.

Police said the state medical examiner confirmed what investigators believed: Joshua Boren shot his wife, 32-year-old Kelly Boren; his 55-year-old mother-in-law, Marie King; and his two children, 7-year-old Joshua 'Jaden' and 5-year-old Haley, before killing himself.

The five of them had just returned from a Christmas break in Disneyworld, Florida.

All five bodies were discovered in bedrooms after Lieutenant Boren, 34, failed to turn up for a night shift.

The shooting happened at the family's home in Spanish Fork, a city of about 37,000 located 50 miles south of Salt Lake City.

The events stunned the community, as well as friends and family, said Johnson, who added investigators didn't find anybody who suspected Joshua Boren was capable of such an act.

Though Joshua Boren wasn't living at the house, friends and family said he still came every morning to get the kids ready for school and preschool, Johnson said. He also picked them up every afternoon.

'He was praised as being an excellent father,' Johnson said.
