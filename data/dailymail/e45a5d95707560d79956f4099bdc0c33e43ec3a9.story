Two Burmese men have now confessed to murdering British backpackers Hannah Witheride and David Miller on the island of Koh Tao, according to police.

Officers arrested three men who were pictured riding a moped away from the scene of the killings on September 14. Two have admitted their guilt, but the third still denies any involvement.

It is not known which of the men in the CCTV image have confessed. 

After the first admission of guilt, a credible source within the police ranks on 'murder island'  told MailOnline that he had been called by a senior officer who said: 'We have a confession. We have a suspect in custody. We are very confident we have our man.'

Investigation: One of the suspects is led in handcuffs by police

The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15

Major General Kiattipong Khawsamang, who is leading the investigation, has since confirmed that another of the migrant workers has also confessed.

Are three suspects are being held in the city of Surat Thani, the closest mainland metropolis to the central Gulf Coast islands. 

Officers previously said they will take the suspects back to Koh Tao for a reenactment of the crime, before those who have pleaded guilty are returned to jail awaiting court.

News of the first confession came through a short statement from Deputy Police Commissioner General Jakthip Chaijinda who said the arrested man was called Win, a bar worker on Koh Tao, who was arrested in Surat Sani.

The announcement came before the man's DNA could be confirmed as a match with DNA found on the body of 23-year-old Miss Witherage from Great Yarmouth.

But the police source told the Mail last night: 'We are expecting the DNA results by late today or on Friday at the latest. Everyone is very confident.'

According to the Nation newspaper, quoting sources, Win told police that he saw 'the foreigners having sex so he made the attack with a plan to rape the woman.'

However, there appears to be a discrepancy in that statement as there is no evidence that Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller were walking on the beach together and stopped near the guest house where they were both staying for a sexual encounter in the early hours of the morning.

The last known picture of the pair, together with a group at the sports bar called Choppers - they also went to the AC bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament 

And police have said previously that no trace of Mr Miller's DNA had been found on Miss Witheridge. But they have said that DNA from two Asian men had been recovered from her.

Last week, in the wake of heavy criticism over the investigation of the murders, police sought to allay fears that the killers had long escaped and said they were 'confident' that a significant breakthrough was on the horizon. 

Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma. But there have been no matches so far with the victims.

Police have offered a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly £13,300 - for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits. 

Yesterday Thai police were accused of beating up a taxi driver who refused to give false evidence about a football team suspected of being involved in the killings.

Pornprasit Sukdam claims he was offered the full 700,000 baht reward if he agreed to be a fake witness to events leading up to the deaths, but says officers attacked him when he said no.

He said he complained to the district chief Kobchai Saowalak and asked for protection over fears of another attack after the officers said they intended to question him again on Tuesday. 

Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder

Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of Miss Witheridge, who hails from Great Yarmouth, in the early hours of September 15. 

A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. 

Two different semen samples collected from Ms Witheridge's body form the remainder of the DNA evidence, Thai police told the Bangkok Post.

'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang said earlier this week.

'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.' 

Police believe  Mr Miller, who lived in Jersey, was killed when he went to his recently-met friend's aid after finding in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach.

Around 150 additional police officers have posted to Koh Tao to assist the murder investigation.

The probe was launched after cleaners found the bodies of Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller on a beach on 15 September.

Both victims suffered severe head injuries at the hands of their killers, and a bloodied garden hoe was found nearby.
