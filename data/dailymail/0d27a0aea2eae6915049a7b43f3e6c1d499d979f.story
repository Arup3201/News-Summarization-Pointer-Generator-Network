Team news

Stoke

Stoke will assess the condition of forward Mame Biram Diouf ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Leicester at the Britannia Stadium.

Since scoring the Potters' winner in their shock victory at Manchester City on August 30, Diouf has been away on international duty with Senegal and had not been back in training with his club by Friday.

Winger Oussama Assaidi is in contention to make his 'second debut' after rejoining the Staffordshire outfit on another season-long loan deal from Liverpool on transfer deadline day.

But midfielder Stephen Ireland (rib) looks set to miss out along with Geoff Cameron (hernia) and Peter Odemwingie (knee), both of whom have undergone surgery.

Provisional squad: Begovic, Sorensen, Bardsley, Pieters, Huth, Muniesa, Wilson, Shawcross, Teixeira, Wilkinson, Whelan, Palacios, Nzonzi, Adam, Sidwell, Walters, Arnautovic, Diouf, Bojan, Crouch, Moses.

Leicester 

A trio of new signings come into the reckoning for Leicester manager Nigel Pearson ahead of his side's Barclays Premier League clash with Stoke on Saturday.

Defender Danny Simpson, along with strikers Tom Lawrence and Nick Powell - the latter on loan from Manchester United - are added to the squad for the game at the Britannia Stadium.

Defender Matthew Upson (foot) remains sidelined, and although Matty James is training again after a lay-off with a shin injury, the game comes too soon for the midfielder.

Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Hamer, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Schlupp, Moore, Morgan, King, Hammond, Albrighton, Knockaert, Mahrez, Vardy, Taylor-Fletcher, Ulloa, Nugent, Wood, Drinkwater, Cambiasso, Simpson, Powell, Lawrence.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

The Potters are unbeaten in five home meetings with Leicester in all competitions (W4 D1).

Indeed, none of the last 10 clashes between the Potters and the Foxes have been won by the away side (six home wins, four draws).

Leicester City are without a clean sheet in 11 Premier League games; the longest run of any current top-flight side.

Since the start of last season, only Chelsea (2) and Liverpool (5) have scored more than once against Stoke at the Britannia Stadium.

Stoke are unbeaten in their last five home meetings with Leicester, not losing since James Scowcroft scored the only goal for the Foxes in an August 2002 second tier clash

The Potters, who lost 1-0 to Aston Villa on the opening day, have not lost consecutive home league games since April 2013.

Nigel Pearson’s side have scored in 33 of their last 34 league games, failing only to net against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

Indeed, that 2-0 defeat at Chelsea was Leicester’s first away defeat this calendar year (W8 D4).

The Foxes have blocked 25 opposition shots so far this season; at least 10 more than any other team in the Premier League.

Stoke are the only Premier League side yet to net in the first-half in 2014-15.

Leicester new boy Nick Powell currently has the best min/goal ratio of any player in Premier League history, having scored once in 29 minutes of top-flight football.
