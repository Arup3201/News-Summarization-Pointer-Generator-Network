A wanted man has been shot and wounded at a children's hospital today after he tried to grab a baby, according to emerging reports. 

The Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in Wauwatosa reported an 'active shooter' on the seventh floor in the neonatal unit around noon on Thursday. 

Milwaukee Police officers were apparently conducting a warrant pickup for a man who was
wanted for 'felon in possession of a firearm' while he was holding a baby.

The Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Wauwatosa reported an 'active shooter' on the seventh floor around noon on Thursday but had since been given the all-clear

When he was told he was under arrest, the suspect fled and ran down a hallway pulling out a handgun, according to Fox.

He turned to the officers and showed the handgun several times. The number of shots fired by the suspect was not revealed.

Officers fired several times and wounded the suspect. He was taken to Froedtert Hospital in a stable condition.

Police officers attempted to arrest a felon in the neonatal ward on Thursday before he took off running down the hall. He was shot by officers but his injuries are non-life threatening

The mother and baby involved in the incident were fine, according to police and no hospital staff or officers were injured. 

Sheriff Clarke would not comment on the appropriateness of trying to pick up a wanted man for a gun offense in a children's ward.

He said: 'It's too early to be second-guessing... Here's a better question: ''What is this idiot doing in a neonatal care unit with a handgun?'''

The sheriff said that the hospital does not have metal detectors to search visitors for weapons.

The hospital has now been given the all clear and tweeted: 'Law enforcement has issued an all-clear for all Children's Hospital buildings. There is no danger to patients, families or employees.'

Sheriff Clarke said outside the hospital that no one other than the suspect had been wounded in the neonatal unit

Sheboygan resident Chad Starkey, 29, said he was on the seventh floor and down the hall from his son's room when he heard an announcement over the loud speaker that there was someone on the floor with a gun and that staff and visitors should hide and barricade themselves.

'My first thought was to protect my son,' Mr Starkey said. He, his wife and a few nurses hid in a small closet for about 30 minutes. The whole time, he said, he worried someone might hurt his son.

'This is a disgrace. This hospital has to have some kind of security. If one person can get in with a gun, then anyone can,' Mr Starkey said.

Irma Blazek, an interpreter, was in the cafe on the first floor of the hospital when she heard a code for an active shooter over the loudspeaker. Blazek said she and 10 to 15 other people hid in a stairwell for over an hour.

'It was just bizarre,' Ms Blazek said. 'This is the last place you would think something g like this would happen.'

Mike Sanfellippo, 39, of Random Lake, was in the hospital with his 11-year-old son who was being treated and on crutches.

Sanfellippo said they were ready to leave for the parking lot, but were sent to an administrative building across the street after being told of the lockdown.

Sanfellippo said his first instinct was to 'get the hell out of here and protect the kid'.
