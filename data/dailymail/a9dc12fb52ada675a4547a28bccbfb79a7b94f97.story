A Second World War hero who was horrifically injured during a German shell attack at Arnhem before going on to become a much-loved MP has died, aged 90.

Captain Robert Boscawen represented Wells and Somerton and Frome for more than 20 years after he returned from the war a decorated veteran.

The tank commander was among the first to enter Brussels in 1944 and was awarded the distinguished Military Cross for his efforts in the battle to relieve Arnhem.

The Coldstream Guard was severely wounded and left disfigured, with burns to his face and body, when an enemy shell pierced his tank in April 1945 - the last month of the war.

He was evacuated to the pioneering plastic surgery unit at East Grinstead, West Sussex - known as the Guinea Pig Club - where he spent three years in and out of hospital recovering alongside Battle of Britain Spitfire pilots.

But undaunted by his injuries, he periodically volunteered with the British Red Cross civilian relief teams in Hamburg, West Germany, in 1947 and 1948.

He joined the Young Conservatives in the final year but it was not until 1970 that he was elected as an MP - after two failed attempts in 1964 and 1966.

Mr Boscawen - the eldest son of Lord 
Falmouth - remained member for Wells for 13 years until boundary changes
 saw him become the MP for Somerton and Frome until 1992.

The
 Eton College graduate also held the esteemed position of Comptroller of
 the Royal Household in 1988 - the MP responsible for keeping the Queen 
up to date with Commons business.

He joined the Privy Council - a group of advisers to the sovereign - in 1992, the same year he retired from politics.

Speaking in 2007, he said being born in 1923 and then serving in World War Two meant his life had been shaped by war.

He said: 'They were world wars - total wars. We were of the age when life was enormously affected by war.'

Family said Mr Boscawen - known as Bob to his friends - passed away peacefully on December 28 on the Isle of Wight.

In 1944, Britain's normally cautious Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery proposed a bold gambit to bust through German lines at Arnhem, in Holland.

He suggested British and American parachute formations drop miles behind enemy lines to create a path for the British armored forces.

The Allied commanders hoped to cross the Rhine, outflank the German defenses protecting the Ruhr industrial region, and bring about the collapse of the Third Reich.

It was a daring plan but the final river crossing at Arnhem could not be held by the outnumbered British paratroopers. The offensive failed to achieve its objective.

Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Wells constituency James Heappey, paid tribute to the esteemed politician.

He said: 'It is with great sadness that I learned of the death of the Bob Boscawen.

'Whether winning the Military Cross by
 defeating a massive Nazi tank attack in the Second World War or serving
 this constituency with great dedication and distinction in the 1970s 
and 1980s, he was a great man who cared dearly for our local area and 
who set an example that I aspire to follow.'

He leaves three children - Dozmary, 63, Hugh, 59, and Karenza, 53. Captain Boscawe's wife Mary died in May, aged 89. His funeral service will be held in Wells Cathedral on Thursday January 16, at 2pm.

Family has requested no flowers but donations can be made to the Coldstream Guards Charitable Funds.
