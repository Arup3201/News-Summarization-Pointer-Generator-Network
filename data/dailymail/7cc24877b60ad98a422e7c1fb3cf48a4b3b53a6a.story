A rookie NYPD officer shot an innocent unarmed father-of-one dead by accident as he walked down a dark stairwell, police have revealed.

The department's Internal Affairs Bureau has launched an investigation after Peter Liang entered a housing project in Brooklyn and shot Akai Gurley in the chest as his horrified girlfriend watched.

The officer, who joined the force in 2013, raised his gun and fired when he heard noises.

The hit on Thursday night caused the 28-year-old to fall from the seventh to fifth floor of Pink Houses where he then collapsed, according to the New York Post.  

During a press conference, Commissioner Bill Bratton described the shooting as an 'accident' that took place because the scene was 'pitch black'. 

He said: 'As the officers were entering the eight floor landing, the lights were not operable. Everything points to accidental discharge.'

Bratton explained that Gurley had lost his life because of a 'coincidence.'

'The deceased is a total innocent who had just happened to be in the hall way at the same time the cops,' he added.
