Roy Hodgson has unveiled his 23-man squad to bid for World Cup glory when the Three Lions jet out to Brazil later this summer.

Hodgson confirmed he will be taking a side packed with young talent as England bid to end their 48-year wait for a second world title.

One notable absentee is Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick, less than two years after he was tempted out of international retirement by the England manager.

THe boss: Roy Hodgson has named his 23 man squad for the World Cup in Brazil

Star man: Wayne Rooney is one of the key strikers in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad

Carrick is a big-name casualty as 
Hodgson proved his determination to include young midfielders Ross 
Barkley, Jordan Henderson and Jack Wilshere in the 23-man squad.

Hodgson
 also revealed Everton youngster John Stones will come into the squad if
 Phil Jones' shoulder injury does not heal in time.

Ashley Cole and Jermain Defoe (with 162 caps between them) are the other most senior internationals jettisoned.

Rickie Lambert, who has scored 14 goals this season, gets the nod ahead of Andy Carroll.

Former Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe, who now plays for Toronto FC, is only good enough for a place on the standby list.

Carrick rejected the chance to be on the standby list for Euro 2012, but he has accepted the same position this time around. 

No-go: Michael Carrick has missed out on a chance of being in the England midfield in Brazil

Hart, Forster, Forster, Baines, Cahill, Jagielka, Johnson, Jones, Shaw, Smalling, Barkley, Gerrard, Henderson, Lallana, Lampard, Milner, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sterling, Wilshere, Lambert, Rooney, Sturridge, Welbeck

Standby: Ruddy, Cleverley, Flanagan, Carroll, Stones, Defoe, Carrick

Carrick is joined in Hodgson's 
contingency planning by Tom Cleverley, who has not made the 23 despite 
starting nine consecutive games under Hodgson at the start of the 
2012-13 season.

Hodgson has selected just four strikers for the tournament in Brazil, which kicks off on June 12.

Wayne Rooney will be the leading 
striker, with Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck and Lambert in support. 
Frank Lampard, 35, makes the cut, but otherwise there is a youthful look
 about England's midfield selection.

Ross Barkley, 20, has been selected, alongside Liverpool teenager Raheem Sterling.Arsenal duo Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere are in the 23 despite their recent injury concerns.

Adam Lallana, who has three caps, has been rewarded for a fine year with Southampton by being included.

James
 Milner also is favoured ahead of the likes of Adam Johnson and Ashley 
Young - neither of whom made the squad or standby list.

There were no surprises in defence. Gary Cahill, Phil Jagielka, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling were Hodgson's four centre-halves.

Leighton
 Baines goes to Brazil as first-choice left-back, with Shaw in reserve. 
Glen Johnson goes to the tournament as England's only recognised 
right-back.

Hodgson selected
 Fraser Forster as third goalkeeper behind Joe Hart and Ben Foster. 
There was a place on the standby list for Everton teenager John Stones, 
who only made his first Premier League start in January.

Uncapped Liverpool right-back Jon Flanagan was also on the standby list. Those standby players will fly to Portugal with the squad next Monday for a week-long training camp.

Hodgson admitted the decision to leave out Cole was 'an unbelievably hard' call. 'Ashley is a player that I and the rest of my staff appreciate,' he said.

'He is a magnificent player and what he's done for England is second to none. Luke Shaw has had a wonderful season. He has captured headlines with his form and ability.

'One player has 107 caps and one has many caps to come. It was a hard job to ring Ashley and I can only be unbelievably grateful for the gracious way he accepted the decision.

'Circumstances will prove whether the decision to take the younger player was the right one or not.'

For
 Carrick, it is a miserable end to a disastrous season at Old Trafford 
and another unsatisfactory episode in a haphazard England career of 31 
appearances in 13 years.

It 
began with a debut against Mexico in 2001 at the age of 19 and his last 
cap was as a starter against Poland in the final World Cup qualifier in 
October.

There has been only
 one taste of action in a major tournament, when Sven Goran Eriksson 
selected him against Ecuador in Germany 2006.

Nine
 of his caps have been awarded by Hodgson, since he was lured out of 
retirement in 2012. Like Cole, his experience and reliability has proved
 valuable to England during the campaign for Brazil.

He
 played in the six of the qualifiers, but Hodgson has shown a glimpse of
 his ruthlessness by casting them both aside as he moves the team into 
the next phase.

Confusion 
reigned as Carrick was left out two years ago. Having officially retired
 from international football under Fabio Capello, Hodgson assumed that 
was that.

‘I was given to 
believe he didn’t want to be part of the England set-up,’ said Hodgson, 
but it turned out he did want to play and had unfinished business with 
England.

Young gun: Saints starlet Luke Shaw has been picked ahead of Ashley Cole

After a terrific 
2011-12 season with his club, the United midfielder came back for the 
friendly against Italy in Switzerland, amid a national debate about how 
to value ball possession, which followed the exit in Kiev orchestrated 
by Italian pass-master Andrea Pirlo.

In
 the heat of a World Cup, which will start for England in the jungle 
city of Manaus, Carrick might have expected this to be the perfect 
moment for his calming qualities, but events at United have not helped. 
 Nor has the development of young midfield players.

A
 year ago, Carrick started the summer friendlies in the absence of 
Steven Gerrard against the Republic of Ireland at Wembley and Brazil in 
Rio, and deep midfield was one of the areas where Hodgson considered his
 options to be thin.

Wilshere
 was struggling for fitness – as he still is - and Barkley had yet to 
emerge as a force at Premier League level. Henderson, too, has 
progressed beyond expectations in the last 12 months.

Without
 Carrick, however, there is no natural replacement for Gerrard as the 
midfield anchorman if the captain is lost to injury or suspension during
 the tournament.

Gareth 
Barry is another with the required defensive instinct, able to deputise 
in the holding role but he has never been recalled by Hodgson since he 
was injured in Norway, in a warm-up friendly against of Euro 2012.

Frank
 Lampard has played the holding role at times for Chelsea but has not 
made the conversion as completely as Gerrard.

The ever-versatile James 
Milner and Phil Jones could be adapted, but if there is a bare patch in 
the squad it is here.

It 
appears to have been boiled down to a straight choice between West Ham 
Academy graduates Lampard and Carrick to supply midfield experience; 
Carrick’s stability and ball retention versus Lampard’s goal knack and 
general good influence around the camp.

Not for the first time Carrick is England’s fall-guy.
