Whilst some Americans might install an alarm system or even surveillance cameras to protect their homes, others are going a little further.

Gun shops in Rocklin, California, have reported a huge surge in gun sales during the holiday season as locals try to keep themselves safe.

One local neighbourhood has seen two break-ins over the last few weeks and at least three women from there have been at a gun shop to stock up.

It’s the rise in female buyers that is perhaps most surprising - with more women buying guns than ever before, reported CBS Sacramento.

‘People are just coming in to protect themselves,’ an employee at TDS Guns in Rocklin told CBS Sacramento.

‘I think there’s just a lot of things going on in the world that are getting people thinking,’ the employee added.

The Firearms Dealers Association says the recent boom in gun purchases makes this the best holiday sales season in three years.

Black Friday gun shopping soared, with the FBI saying the background checks done on that day were up 32 per cent on three years ago.

One victim of a Rocklin break-in told CBS Sacramento she has bought herself a gun because: ‘I’m gonna be ready for the next time.’

Figures also show increased seasonal sales of stun guns and pepper spray, which has been in the news during the Occupy Wall Street protests.

So spare a thought for customer Bob Nogard’s nearest and dearest, who should expect to open a firearm under the Christmas tree next Sunday.

Whilst some shoppers queued up on Black Friday for a cut-price Xbox, TV or handbag, others just wanted to get themselves a new gun.

The FBI said there were 129,166 background checks on the day this year, which blasted the previous record of 97,848 in 2008, reported RT.

One gun store in Missouri opened up at 5am but customers had to wait to buy anything until 7am, when the background check system opened.

‘Some of the people at the gate sent their kid running to the gun counter to get in line,’ MC Sports store manager Tom Ritzer told ABC News.
