A four-year-old autistic boy has lived out his dream of becoming a police officer, thanks to a San Diego police sergeant who organized for the little boy to take part in a motorcycle parade.

Alexander Sanchez became Officer Xander for the day, when he rode into the Southern Division police substation  parking lot on his mini motorcycle.

About 20 officers were out front to greet Xander and a handful of motorcycle cops followed him on their bikes, with lights flashing, in a police parade.

The little boy's dreams were turned into a reality by Sergeant Lem Siansonoy, who met Xander when he was approached by him for a police sticker, UT San Diego reports.

'We were taking a walk and Xander saw (him) sitting in his car,' said the boy's aunt, Ana Villegas. 'He walked right up and knocked on the window and asked for a sticker.'

The police sergeant didn't have any stickers on him, but he promised Xander he would stop by his home in the Otay Mesa West neighborhood in southern San Diego.

Sergeant Siansonoy told the paper that he understood just how important these stickers could be to a boy like Xander. 

He was a young Cambodian refugee when his school, Sherman Elementary, was adopted by the San Diego Police Department. An officer gave him one of his stickers, and it made an impression on the young Siansonoy.

'I know it's just a paper sticker, but it was a symbolic thing for me,' he said. 'I wanted a real one and that's one of the reasons I'm a police officer today.'

As promised, a couple of weeks later, the sergeant surprised Xander with an impromptu visit to the home with a bag of police-themed goodies including a ball, a key chain and stickers.

Xander greeted the sergeant wearing his police Halloween costume, and he even had his miniature police motorcycle parked out front.

'Part of what makes him feel safe and secure is dressing up,' explained Ms Villegas, 25. 'He's dressed up as a firefighter and a soldier. He's been dressing as a police officer for almost two years.'

Xander was diagnosed with autism aged 3, but he is much more positive after his day as a police officer

Sergeant Siansonoy the decided to invite the family to tour the Southern Division police substation, which is just a couple of blocks from Xander's home.

Xander arrived in his little motorcycle to be grreted by officers on their own bikes who accompanied him on the mini parade. The little boy was also able to have his picture taken with the officers and the whole family was treated to a tour around the station.

'I don't think they realize just what they did for Xander and for us,' said Ms Villegas. 'This couldn't have come at a better time.'

Xander was diagnosed with autism by the age of three and his aunt said that he has struggled to deal with the changes in his life. 

His uncle and his grandfather are the father figures, but his grandfather has been away for work and his uncle, who is in the Navy, was recently stationed on the East Coast.

'He's been moody from not having that male stability and his behavior has been really unpredictable,' his aunt said.

Xander is cared for by his grandmother and Ms Villegas during the day, while his mother is at work.

The positive change in Xander after the visit to the police station has been remarkable, his aunt said.

'This was so positive,' she added. 'They made him feel noticed, and most of all, important. That they would give so much after such a small request, it's really amazing.'

The only down side, according to Ms Villegas, is that she and Xander's grandmother have been getting a lot of tickets since Xander visited the police station.

'They gave him a notepad to write tickets and he's been giving them to everyone,' she said. 'You're on grandma's driveway? You get a ticket.'
