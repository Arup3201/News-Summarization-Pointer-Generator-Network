Hot pink uniforms are the newest fashion for inmates at the city jail in Grovetown, Georgia.

The public safety chief views the style as a crime-fighting weapon.

About 10 inmates donned the first batch of the brightly colored uniforms this month as they picked up trash along the city's roads.

The pink uniforms will be reserved for inmates serving sentences for misdemeanor crimes.

With the new rule mandating male inmates, who normally wear orange, to now wear pink - it seems to be working as sergeants said inmates commented they do not want to return to the jail if they have to wear the color, reported Atlanta Daily World. 

'Folks will see our inmates picking up trash in the gullies wearing hot pink, and hopefully it'll give them a second thought if they want to come here and do wrong,' said Gary Jones, director of the city's public safety department.

Jones said he was inspired by his hero, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona who made international news when he required inmates to wear pink underwear and pink handcuffs.

America's self-proclaimed 'toughest sheriff' also made headlines last year when it was revealed he put 38 inmates on a bread and water meal plan after they 'desecrated the American flag' in their cells. 

The sheriff also punishes problem inmates by forcing them to eat his 'nutraloaf', made of mash of vegetables, fruit, meat and other nutrients that are blended together and baked into a bread-like loaf.

It is hoped the new rule for the Grovetown jail, located in a city with under 15,000 people in suburban Augusta, will demonstrate that law officers run the jail, not the inmates according to Jones.

The state of Georgia has a recidivism rate of 30 per cent which has remained unchanged for a decade, according to a report from the Georgia Council on Criminal Justice Reform.

Georgia's prison population also doubled to nearly 56,000 between 1990 and 2011. 

Jones hopes the uniforms will convince inmates not to come back after they are released. 

'I know most men wouldn't be caught dead in one, so I thought this would be an added level of deterrence,' he said.

In other moves for the jail, they have added more security cameras.
