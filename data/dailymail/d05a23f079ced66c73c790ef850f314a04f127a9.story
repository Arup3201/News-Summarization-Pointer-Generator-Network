There's supposed to be a word in golf when a wayward ball flies towards an unsuspecting bystander... but maybe that's just in the amateur game.

No one shouted 'fore' when America's Keegan Bradley teed off at the 14th hole during the Presidents Cup today, and watched his ball veer away from the green towards a crowd of spectators.

The errant ball plunged from the sky straight onto the head of a fan standing in the front row, sending him sprawling onto his backside to a collective gasp from all around him.

Fore pity's sake! Only the man's legs can be seen in this shot as he falls back into the crowd moments after the errant ball struck him on the head

Good start: It started with US golfer Keegan Bradley teed off on the 14th hole at the Presidents Cup in Ohio

No warning: The ball is seen flying through the air towards the green, before it begins to veer off course

The 'clonk' of ball-on-skull was so loud that it was even picked up by television microphones placed strategically about the green.

Even the commentators did not see the danger until the unfortunate victim was already on the grass.

'Oooh, he's knocked that guy out. Aaah, right on the head,' says one of the announcers as the man swoons on the floor clutching his head.

Par for the course: Course attendants rushed to help the man, who appeared dazed and in a lot of pain

'That hurt,' the commentator adds helpfully. 'That seriously hurt.'

It is unclear whether he need further treatment for his injuries but, needless to say, Keegan Bradley lost the hole.
