This is the moment a daredevil skier flies down a vertical crevice in the Alaskan wilderness. 

Cody Townsend, 31, from California, took to the Tordrillo Mountains, 75 miles northwest of Anchorage to perform the death-defying stunt.

A video shows him peering down the run before taking a deep breath and bombing it down at high speed.

He is seen weaving steadily through the snow, managing to avoid the sharp rock which towers above him on each side. 

Townsend told the Daily News that the chute was around five to six feet wide at its narrowest, leaving little room for error. 

It takes him just 30 seconds to complete the steep course.

Ready, set, go: A video shows him peering down the run before taking a deep breath and bombing it down

'Holy f***!' he exclaims as he exits the chute into daylight. 

Townsend was honored Saturday at the 2014 Powder Awards in Salt Lake City for skiing what was deemed the most challenging line of the  year. 

The sportsman can be heard saying, 'oh, I’m getting nervous,' before his descent but his run was completed without consequence.

Townsend says that he's 'never skied to win an award' it's just a passion he's had since childhood.

Over in a flash: It takes him just 30 seconds to complete the steep course

There is apparently no official name for either the peak or the chute which Townsend tackled.

'There are so many mountains in Alaska that only the biggest and most iconic peaks tend to have official names,' he said. 

'We have some unofficial name for the zone and for the chute, but they're pretty vulgar and not quite fit to print.'

Townsend's video, titled Days Of My Youth, has been viewed more than 1.3 million times to date with many applauding the skier's mind-boggling skill.
