A customer has sued luxury fashion label Prada after being unable to remove a stain from a silk skirt.

Catherine Whitty, 40, a physiotherapist from Melbourne, spent £971 ($1,660 in Australian dollars) on the skirt but spilled champagne on the garment during birthday celebrations.

When Whitty took the piece to the drycleaners, she was told that it couldn't be removed, according to reports in Australian paper, the Herald Sun.

What's more, reported the paper, Whitty was 'surprised' to be told that in addition to champagne, any liquid - including rainwater and even accidental splashes of water during hand-washing - would stain and indeed permanently damage the fabric.

Incensed, Whitty launched legal action against the brand, claiming that sales staff were told the outfit was being purchased for a champagne celebration and should have warned her.

She argued that she had chosen the 'timeless' A-line skirt because she expected to be able to wear it again and assumed it would be fit for 'common usage'.

But Prada argued that retail operations manager Albin Cheng said that it was Ms Whitty's responsibility to care for the skirt.

Success: Whitty took the Italian luxury label to court and was awarded a full refund by the tribunal

He told the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal that staff had recommended the purchase of the skirt based on fashion, and not on what would be served during celebrations.

Cheng also said that Whitty's failure to have the skirt cleaned immediately compounded the problem and increased the damage.

But despite his protests, tribunal member Peter Moloney found in Ms Whitty's favour and ordered the brand to hand over a full refund.

He added that unless sold with a warning, garments should be expected to withstand splashes of water, or, indeed, champagne.
