Comedy actor James Corden, whose hit series Gavin & Stacey was given its big break by BBC3, has backed the decision to axe the TV channel and move its output online.

The BBC has earmarked the station for a move to its iPlayer service from 2015, which it says would save millions to reinvest in other programming.

The plan to scrap the channel after 11 years has faced criticism from many of its stars, including Jack Whitehall and Richard Bacon, who have started a Twitter protest to block director general Tony Hall’s move.

However, Mr Corden, who wrote and starred in one of BBC3's biggest hits Gavin & Stacey, said the youth audience which the station is aimed was comfortable with viewing programmes on a computer rather than via a television.

'I think it should always be at the 
forefront of what is fresh and exciting, and therefore it should be the 
first channel to exist online," he told The Guardian at the Advertising Week Europe event in London.

'Providing
 they still invest and it's still a commitment to make new and 
interesting shows, then its audience will find them in the same way you 
and I enjoy House Of Cards (on Netflix).'

Success story: Gavin & Stacey, which was written by Mr Corden and Ruth Jones, began life on BBC3 in 2007 but as its success grew, it graduated to BBC1

Younger audience: Mr Corden, who played Smithy in the popular show, said he did not know if Gavin & Stacey would be commissioned by BBC3 today

Mr Corden said he was happy that the BBC remained committed to investing in young writers, performers and directors and that the corporation would continue to cater for its young audience.

The online-only move was proposed last month and is expected to deliver savings of up to £50 million a year, which the corporation says will be ploughed back into enhancing BBC1.

However, more than 225,000 people have signed a petition opposing the plan.

When the move to shut down the channel was announced, Mr Whitehall,
who appears in the BBC3 comedy Bad Education, claimed it was 
vital for fostering new talent. Matt Lucas, who starred in Little 
Britain with David Walliams, said the thought of the channel’s demise were ‘horrible’.

New project: Mr Corden's most recent comedy drama The Wrong Mans was screened by BBC2, and was co-produced with American TV on demand service Hulu

Comedy series Gavin & Stacey, which was written by Mr Corden and co-star Ruth Jones, began life on BBC3 in 2007 but
 as its success grew, it graduated to BBC1.

It told the story of a young couple 
conducting a long-distance relationship between Barry in Wales and 
Billericay in Essex and their subsequent marriage,

'The truth is, I don't know if Gavin & Stacey would be commissioned by BBC3 today,' Mr Corden said.

'The channel has changed. It was 2007 that we made that show. It has a much younger outlook.'

Controversial: Director general Tony Hall's move to move BBC3 online has been met with criticism from some of the channel's other stars

Mr Corden's most recent comedy 
drama The Wrong Mans was screened by BBC2, and was co-produced with American TV on demand service Hulu.

He said that the success of similar services such as Netflix, which enables viewers to stream television programmes and films to their televisions or computers showed that BBC3 could continue to flourish online.

He also pointed out that some of the channel's shows were already premiered on iPlayer, before being shown on television.

Last year an episode of Bad Education was seen nearly three million times on iPlayer, making it the service's fourth most watched show in 2013.

Bad move: Bad Education star Jack Whitehall said BBC3's support of new comedy was 'vital'

Despite James Corden's support of the move to make BBC3 online only, many of the channel's other stars have spoken out against the decision.

In the wake of reports of the channel's demise, comedians including Jack Whitehall, Matt Lucas and Russell Kane, as well as presenters Nick Grimshaw, Greg James and Richard Bacon all took to Twitter in a bid to save BBC3. 

Whitehall, who appears in BBC3 show Bad Education wrote: 'I really hope reports that the BBC may kill BBC3 are just rumours. Their support of new comedy in particular is vital!'

And BBC Radio 1 breakfast DJ Grimshaw, who also presents panel show Sweat The Small Stuff, described BBC3 as 'silly, funny, smart, young and essential'.

Like Gavin & Stacey, Little Britain was also first aired on BBC3 and its star Matt Lucas said closing the channel would be 'really bad for new comedy. Like, really bad. Little Britain, Gavin & Stacey, Torchwood, Being Human, Mighty Boosh, Pramface, Ideal – BBC3 is the home of new comedy and drama.'

In 2010, the BBC was forced to abandon plans to axe Radio 6Music after its stars organised a vocal public protest.

5Live presenter Bacon threatened to stage a similar campaign against the proposed BBC3 cut, saying: ‘BBC3 makes lots of great, clever, distinct programmes. If the rumours of it being cut are true, we might need to retool that 6Music campaign.’

Comedian Russell Kane, claimed the channel was the ‘crucible of upcoming comedic artists’, and

Presenter Greg James, who also regularly appears on the channel, said: ‘Such a load of balls if the rumours about BBC3 being axed are true. Brilliant new comedy and live music needs that platform.’

However, others have supported the proposal and expressed relief that Lord Hall will at least save BBC4. The high-brow station, which has an older audience, had been seen as the other main contender for the axe.

On 
the BBC’s online message board, Points of View, the overwhelming 
majority of viewers said they would prefer BBC3 to be scrapped rather 
than see BBC4 disappear. One said that BBC4, which mainly broadcasts 
documentaries and arts programmes, is ‘too good to go’, while another 
added: ‘BBC3 should go. Its programmes are pretty puerile.’
