It reportedly cost $225million to produce but Disney's latest release - The Lone Ranger - has failed to excite movie-goers and has $16million of debt to claw back.

Starring Jonny Depp, the producers simply thought their modern take on a western would appeal to a greater audience, but in fact, few under 25s have opted to see the film.

Made by the same team that created the lucrative Disney franchise 'Pirates of the Caribbean' - the four film series that grossed $3.7 billion worldwide - the Western drew bad reviews and failed to capture the attention of younger moviegoers.

'We thought it would appeal to a broader audience than it did,' Dave Hollis, head of distribution for Disney, said.

Based on the long-running radio programme begun in 1933 and the TV series that debuted in 1949, the 'Lone Ranger' brand proved a musty one. The audience for the film skewed heavily toward older moviegoers, with 68 per cent of its audience older than 25.

'You think that you have everything in place,' said Hollis, listing the proven box-office commodities of Depp, Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer.

'Even when you have all the ingredients for what you think will be a four-quadrant, `everybody' picture, sometimes it doesn't work out that way.'

The poor performance of 'The Lone Ranger" called to mind a previous bomb for Disney: last year's similarly-budgeted science-fiction adventure "John Carter,' which opened with $30.1 million.

But 'The Lone Ranger', which stars Armie Hammer as the masked lawman, will likely fare better than that disappointment, since Depp's international star power should bring in better worldwide business. It started with $24.3 million abroad, opening in about 30 percent of its planned international market.

While critics skewered the film, it did earn a decent B+ CinemaScore grade from moviegoers. But 'The Lone Ranger' is nevertheless likely to be a sizeable write-down for Disney and could impact the company's stock price when markets reopen Monday.

'Everybody beat up on The Lone Ranger pretty hard,' said Paul Dergarabedian, analyst for box-office tracker Hollywood.com. 'Everything was just not going in its favor.'

Gore Verbinski's reimagining of the 
iconic lawman bombed for the Walt Disney Co., opening with just $29.4million over the weekend, and a disappointing $48.9million since 
Wednesday.

On the other hand, Universal, which made sequel 'Despicable Me 2' for the comparatively small amount of $76million, took $82.5 million over the weekend and $142.1million across the five-day holiday window.

The better than expected haul (along with another $88.8 million overseas) establishes 'Despicable Me', which stars Steve Carell as a diabolical villain turned stay-at-home dad, as a new franchise for Universal and Chris Meledandri's Illumination Entertainment, the Universal-backed animation company.

Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal, attributed the strong performance to Meledandri, the robust appetite for summer family films, and, above all, those teaming little yellow guys.

The 'minions' will get their own spin-off in 2014, and Rocco said another 'Despicable Me' film is a certainty.

'The minions steal everybody's heart,' Rocco said. 'It's a great time of the year to release a family film with broad appeal.'

Stand-up Kevin Hart's concert documentary 'Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain' proved savvy counter-programming for Summit Entertainment, opening with $17.5million over five days and $10.1million over the weekend.

Fox Searchlight's family comedy 'The Way, Way Back' (which also stars Carell) opened in 19 theaters with a strong theater average of about $30,000. It slowly expands for a July 26 national release.Â
