A school bus driver in Olympia, Washington, has been placed on leave after he was caught on video bullying a developmentally disabled 14-year-old girl.

Louanne Bay, said her daughter, Mariah, a student at Washington Middle School, had complained for more than a year that the bus driver had been calling her names and encouraging other special need students on the bus to do the same.

But the girl's complaints were only acted upon recently, when footage was unearthed allegedly showing the man in the act.

Bay said her daughter is afraid of bees after spotting one on the bus, and in the tape the bus driver can be heard telling the girl, 'I am going to bring a beehive on the bus,' among other nasty remarks.

'You can clearly hear the driver calling my daughter names, encouraging other children to bully her,' Bay, who was shown the video last week, told The Olympian.

'All of the children on the bus are special needs with a variety of disabilities, which makes it even worse.'

The concerned mother added to KOBI 5: 'It was hard (to watch the video). I started to cry when the bus driver was laughing saying he was going to bring a bee hive on the bus.'

Bay said her daughter, who is in the 8th grade but has the development of a 4th grader, also complained that when she asked the driver to turn down the heat in the bus, he purposely turned it up. Mariah also alleged the driver threatened to hit her on occasion, though this wasn't on the video.

'They're going to have to learn how to train their drivers to behave with kids,' Bay told the newspaper. 'It's been a nightmare.'

The Olympia School District says it put the driver on leave last week.

The district is treating this matter very seriously, OSD spokeswoman Rebecca Japhet said in a statement, adding that an investigation is underway.

'In the meantime, staff is committed to working with this family to ensure the student feels safe and supported on her way to school, at school and on the way home from school.'

Bay said the school district has refused to release to her a copy of the videotape, or a transcript of the driver's comments.
