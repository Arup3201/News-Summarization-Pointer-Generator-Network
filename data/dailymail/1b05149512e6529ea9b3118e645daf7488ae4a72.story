After 22 years of trying to conceive a daughter, one Michigan couple have just welcomed their 12th son.

Kateri and Jay Schwandt, who gave birth to their first son, Ty, while they were in college, decided to try for one more child, hoping they might finally have a baby girl.

Instead, the couple brought home Tucker on Sunday August 4th, the 12th boy to enter the family.

'This is a pretty testosterone filled house!' Mr Schwandt told Today.

Twelve men: After 22 years of trying to conceive a daughter, Kateri and Jay Schwandt from Michigan, have just welcomed their 12th son

At home to welcome little Tucker was Tyler, 21, Zach, 17, Drew, 16, Brandon, 14, Tommy, 11, Vinny, ten, Calvin, eight, Gabe, six, Wesley, five, Charlie, three and Luke, nearly two.

'We were getting ready to leave the hospital and I said, "Twelve. Twelve kids. That's crazy,"' recalled Mr Schwandt.

As the only woman in the house, Mrs Schwandt is used to being outnumbered. But she was hopeful this was their chance to welcome some more feminine energy into the house.

'We thought maybe, maybe, you know, we're going to have a girl. Number 12 could be the one,' she said.

Nonetheless, the couple are excited about the latest addition to the Schwandt family.

'We are confident that he is going to fit right in,' said Mr Schwandt before admitting, 'we gave up a long time ago on a little girl showing up in this family.'

Play time: The couple say their growing family was simply a happy accident; there was a four-year gap between 21-year-old Ty and 17-year-old Zach, and after that, a new baby brother arrived every year or two

The couple say their growing family was simply a happy accident.

'When we had Ty, we were in college at the time, and we thought let's have one more so Ty's not ten when he had a brother or sister,' said Mr Schwandt. 'And then little Zach came along, and the flood gates were kind of open.'
