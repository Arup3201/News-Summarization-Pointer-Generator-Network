Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor will play no part in Thursday's Europa League match against Besiktas. 

The Togolese forward has been given the go-ahead to leave Istanbul and fly home to deal with a personal issue.

Tottenham announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning: 'We can confirm that Emmanuel Adebayor has been given permission to return home for personal reasons. This is a private matter and so we will not be providing any further comment.'

The Premier League club are certain to qualify from Group C alongside their Turkish opponents, and avoiding defeat would ensure they finish top.

Adebayor has made 12 appearances for Spurs this season and has scored twice.

The former Arsenal frontman has not played for Spurs since the November international break when Togo failed to qualify for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations.

While Adebayor has endured struggles on the field; he has also had problems off it.

In November, Adebayor's older brother Kola claimed the striker had been brainwashed by Islamic spiritual healers into thinking their mother used black magic to sabotage his form on the pitch.

Kola, 42, a truck driver based in Bremen, Germany, told the Sun on Sunday: '[Emmanuel] has been brainwashed by these Muslim alfas - spiritual men - who prophesise when he scores goals and why he is not playing well.

'They have convinced him his sister and mother put juju curses on him. My mother is very sad. Every day she is crying. I just talked to her on the phone and she was crying again.'

Juju is a word used in West Africa to refer to spells used as part of witchcraft. Juju is said to have started during the days of slavery but is still part of African tradition.

Adebayor was then moved to deny accusations from his sister Maggie that he had kicked their mum Alice out of his house in Africa because he thought she had performed curses on him.

Maggie claimed on radio station Peace FM in Ghana that the Premier League striker was refusing to give his mother money and has not seen her in over a year.

She said their mum was selling 'polythene bags, padlocks and other things' to provide for her family however Emmanuel says his mother left the house of her own accord.

Adebayor, speaking to Peace FM, said: 'I never sacked my mum from the house. She decided to leave the house.

'How am I going to be in touch with my mum if my mum is the one telling everyone that my work will not go forward, so I will just be on my side and do my thing.

'They should stop talking, they should stop doing Juju on me, they should leave me alone.

'I bought a $1.2m house in East Legon for the one talking and calling herself my sister. Can you imagine that sister went to rent the house without my knowledge?'
