Actress: Emily Mortimer has revealed the 'shame' she feels as a working mother when leaving her two children behind while she is away filming

Actress Emily Mortimer has revealed the 'shame' she feels as a working mother when leaving her two children behind while she is away filming.

The Newsroom star, who has two children Samuel, ten, and four-year-old May, says she sometimes feels it might be 'better' were she a stay at home mother.

Mortimer, 42, has described her stress at balancing a work and family life, particularly when filming the HBO drama series, in which she plays MacKenzie Morgan 'Mac' McHale, an executive producer at fictional cable news channel Atlantis Cable News.

'There's a shame involved in going off to
 work which I try to talk myself out of but is nonetheless always a 
little bit there,' the actress told The Observer Magazine.

Mortimer, who married American actor Alessandro Nivola in 2003, is currently filming the show's third and final season, due to air this Autumn, and says the long hours and busy schedule take their toll.

'Even though my earnings from it help to 
support my family, I still struggle with the weird feeling that I'm 
indulging a hobby rather than doing a proper job, and that it might be 
better if I just stayed at home,' she said.

'I don't feel proud of this feeling. I
 hope my daughter will grow up to have the courage to write a TV show on
 her own if she wants and not feel unnecessary confusion about doing a 
great job while having a family at the same time.'

The actress rose to fame in the late 1990s and early 2000s when a string of television roles led to parts in Kenneth Branagh's Love's Labours Lost and 51st State, starring Samuel L Jackson and Robert Carlyle.Â

Since then she has also garnered 
positive reviews for her appearances in Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island
 and Woody Allen's Match Point, before starting work on producer Aaron 
Sorkin's The Newsroom in 2011.

In
 February of this year her comedy series Doll & Em, co-written by 
Mortimer and co-star Dolly Wells, aired on Sky Living - in which she 
plays a fictional version of herself as a Hollywood actress, who hires 
her best friend from childhood (Wells) to be her personal assistant 
while filming in Los Angeles.

The
 show has been hailed for its positive depiction of female friendships 
and Mortimer, the daughter of the late John Mortimer, creator of Rumpole
 of the Bailey, said she has enjoyed making the series, produced by 
Nivolo, as she was able to bring her children to work with her.

Gwyneth Paltrow was criticised for saying how she found it 'harder' to raise children while maintaining an acting career

Emily Mortimer's comments on balancing work with motherhood come weeks after Gwyneth Paltrow was criticised for saying how she found it 'harder' to raise children while maintaining an acting career than if she had a 9 to 5 job.

In an interview with E!Online the actress said: 'I think it's different when you have an office job because It's routine and, you know, you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening.

'When you're shooting a movie, they're like, 'We need you to go to Wisconsin for two weeks,' and then you work 14 hours a day and that part of it is very difficult.'

While she made no mention of movie star salaries, she pointed out her perceived hardships further.

'I think to have a regular job and be a mom is not as, of course there are challenges, but it's not like being on set.'

After receiving much backlash the Oscar winner attempted to clarify her comments in a post on her Goop blog.

'Film work takes one away from home and requires 12-14 hours a day, making it difficult to be the one to make the kids their lunch, drive them to school, and put them to bed.'

She continued: 'This somehow was taken to mean I had said a 9-5 job is easier, and a lot of heat was thrown my way, especially by other working mothers who somehow used my out-of-context quote as an opportunity to express feelings (perhaps projected) on the subject.'
