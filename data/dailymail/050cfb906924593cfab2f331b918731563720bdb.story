Spanish police are searching for a British tourist who has disappeared on the Canary Islands.

Richard Michael Lee, 56, was last seen having breakfast at the Torre del Conde hotel in the island of La Gomera's capital of San Sebastian on October 7.

Police say the keen hiker could be stuck in one of the ravines in the Garajonay National Park.

He had arrived on the island, by himself, on October 5 and was due to return to the UK on Friday, October 19.

The alarm was raised with Guardia Civil officers on the 14th when, having not seen him for a week, worried hotel staff contacted his travel agency.

Clothes and his suitcase were still in his room.

On the day of his disappearance, he was wearing a white polo shirt and jeans.

Few clues: Police are focusing their search on the theory that Mr Lee had gone missing while hiking in the Garajonay National Park around ten miles from his hotel in San Sebastian

His complexion is described as fair and he has long hair which is slightly greying.

Hotel sources told newspaper La Opinion de Tenerife that he was a 'very orderly customer' who had not previously stayed at the venue.

Police sources said several theories as to his vanishing were being considered, but they were focusing on the hypothesis that he had gone missing while hiking.

La Gomera is one of the less popular tourist destinations in the Canaries.

The Garajonay National Park is a world heritage site and contains prehistoric woodland, dating back 11 million years.
