Martha Stewart has always been known as an expert homemaker, but now a New York socialite is accusing her of home-wrecking. 

47-year-old Laura Krupinski, the daughter of famed Hamptons builder Ben Krupinski, told the New York Post today that her father cut her off after she found out about an affair he was having with 72-year-old media mogul.

The married man is a popular builder among the Hamptons set, and worked with Ms Stewart in the past restoring her 24-room house in East Hampton on Lily Pond Lane.

The other woman? Laura Krupinski, daughter of Hamptons builder Ben Krupinski, has accused her father of having an affair with media mogul Martha Stewart, above

Working relationship: Mr Krupinski helped Ms Stewart renovate her East Hampton home on Lily Pond Lane, above

Something more: Ms Krupinski says she saw her father with Ms Stewart on the beach in Florida a few years ago, and it was 'obvious' something was going on between them

A New York Times article from 1992 referenced how he would often shuttle Ms Stewart to and from her home in Connecticut during construction. A video on Ms Stewart's website shows the two fishing.

Daughter Laura, a former model turned jewelry designer, says she found out about their alleged affair a few years ago while they were all in Palm Beach. Ms Krupinski says she saw her father and Martha out on the beach one morning and 'it was obvious something was going on'.

For years she held the secret in, not telling anyone. But this past March she finally told her mother, Bonnie Krupinski.

Kicked out: Since telling her mom about the affair, Laura says she has been striped of her $26,000 monthly allowance, and kicked out of her Bedford home

Worried: After the revelation, Laura says her mother, right, would not return her calls. A source close to Mr Krupinski says they are 'worried' about their daughter

She says her father denied it and called her 'crazy', while her her mother got angry and wouldn't return her calls.

Mr Krupinski cut off his daughter's monthly allowance of $26,000 in April and kicked her out of their Bedford house.

She says they took away everything that she owned including clothes and wedding china.

All gone: Laura says that her parents have taken away everything she owns, from clothing to wedding china

'Dad told me he hated me and never wanted to see me again. We haven't talked since,' Ms Krupinski told the Post.

'They have tried to do everything to hurt me,' she added. 'They paint me as horrendous, I am their only child. There is no love; all they care for is money. I have no demons except my parents.'

So far, Mr Krupinski has not commented. A source close to the builder called it a 'sad situation'.

'They are worried about Laura and they hope she can do something to help herself.'

A representative for Ms Stewart also denied the affair.

'Martha has absolutely nothing to do with this situation. She is good friends with Ben and Bonnie.'
