No Davis Cup match would be complete without some kidology, and some of that duly surrounds the match that everyone in Glasgow wants to see this weekend.

Andy and Jamie Murray versus world champions Bob and Mike Bryan on Saturday looks to be the pivotal rubber of the World Group first round knockout match between Great Britain and America, which begins this afternoon at the Emirates Arena.

Yet the home side were trying to play down expectations that it would happen on Thursday. Middlesex's Dom Inglot was officially named to play with Jamie Murray while the former Wimbledon champion insisted it was 'unlikely' he would play on Saturday.

The smart money, however, would be on a clash of two siblings as the emotional centrepiece of what ought to be a fascinating three days. If, as expected, the match stands at 1-1 by Friday night then GB Captain Leon Smith will surely opt to throw in his trump card against the world's leading pair - however unlucky that would be for Inglot, who has actually beaten them twice this year with Romania's Florin Mergea.

The Murrays against the Bryans would have so many ingredients: brothers versus brothers, Wimbledon champions versus Wimbledon champions, the ultimate doubles specialists versus a supreme singles player. SNP versus USA? Let's not go there.

Playing America in the Davis Cup is not what it was twenty years ago, but there is still a cachet about the fixture that was the original challenge match for this competition when it was invented in 1900.

It is mostly the homecoming of the Murrays that will ensure that the indoor arena next door to Celtic Park will be noisily packed to the rafters when the match begins. Jamie, who has had a cold, on Thursday declared himself fully fit.

The doubles will see a crescendo reached, and it is notable that one of the game's most experienced Referees, Stefan Fransson, has been allocated to the match to ensure that everything remains as orderly as possible.

As Jamie pointed out, the crowd will be 'full of people we've known our whole life, a lot of familiar faces.'

Andy acknowledged that part of the task for him will be to control his emotions over the three days: 'The beginning of the matches are normally where I find it would affect me most in Davis Cup. When you come out, the national anthem, the crowd getting right into it at the beginning. Yes, it's an emotional experience. And sometimes at the beginning of the matches you can be a bit fired up, amped up, whatever you want to call it.

'That tends to subside after the first 15 or 20 minutes. Than you just get down to trying to concentrate on the tactics, the process and trying to win the match.'

The last time a significant American team came to these parts it was the Ryder Cup five months ago at Gleneagles. That ended in defeat and recrimination for the visitors, but their chances of success this time are greater and they are marginally the favourites.

Not as much as they would be in times when they could call upon the likes of their now Captain, Jim Courier, whose relatively shallow pool of players means this will draw scant attention back home.

His biggest call has been to pick world number 47 Donald Young as his second singles player, who could find himself playing a deciding rubber against GB number two James Ward on Sunday afternoon.

Young, now 25, was once the youngest ever junior world number one and has found some good form in the past month. But his achievements have never matched his natural gifts and his sometimes flaky temperament will be tested as never before if he faces the lower ranked Ward with the match still alive.

Britain's own stocks are so modest that there has been a frisson of excitement around the 27 year-old London cabbie's son recent flirtations with the top 100. What he will not lack is motivation, and some of his best performances have come in the Davis Cup, such as when he beat America's Sam Querrey last year.

'The two biggest passions in my life are Arsenal and playing for my country,' he said. ' I am patriotic. I think you have seen that in the past and I think you will see it here.'

He begins today by playing American number one John Isner, who he beat in an exhibition match just prior to the Australian Open. That is unlikely to happen again over five sets against the 6' 10' giant with a sometimes unplayable serve, but against Young he would have a fighting chance.

This tie being close presupposes that Andy Murray can shake off his sometimes erratic post-Melbourne form and win both his singles matches.

Courier was keen to emphasise that this is not a formality: 'Andy' s one of the toughest nuts in the business, he has great offensive and defensive skills,' said Courier. 'That's what's made him such a great player, but everyone is beatable. If Andy's not sharp, he can be vulnerable and he's had some matches this year where he hasn't been as crisp as we've seen him in Australia.'

As ever it is the younger Murray who will bear the greatest burden, with GB trying to pull off its first home win at this elite level of the competition since 1986.

So, what’s the story with the Davis Cup, then?

Now heralded as the world’s largest annual team competition, with 122 nations taking part last year, this World Cup of men’s tennis actually looked more like the old Ryder Cup when it began in 1900 — when Harvard’s tennis team came up with the idea of pitting the best Americans against the finest players from the British Isles. One of those students, Dwight Davis, bought the original trophy — hence the name.

How does it work now?

How long have you got? There are divisions and groups, relegation play-offs and zones. Having expanded to six teams in 1905, the Davis Cup responded to the onset of the Open era by going global in 1969. If you’re in the elite top 16, where Britain are now, it becomes a whole lot more simple. Straight knock-out matches, with the winner of the final walking off with the trophy.

And Britain are good, are they?

Since reaching the final in 1978, GB have plummeted to some pretty low depths over the years. Now ranked 11th, think of us as the West Brom of tennis, yo-yoing up and down between the top division and the Europe/Africa Zone 1.

How does the scoring work?

There are five matches — or rubbers — played over the course of three days, with a team point available in each rubber. It starts with two singles matches on the Friday, there’s a doubles rubber on the Saturday, then the reverse singles on the Sunday. It can all be over by Saturday afternoon, if one team wins the first three rubbers.

Team GB will lean heavily on Andy Murray, who may yet play in the doubles — as well as his two singles rubbers — despite not being named alongside brother Jamie in yesterday’s draw.

What happens if we win this one?

A victory for Britain would see them progress to the World Group quarter-finals, to be played between July 17-19. Yes, that’s right, the same weekend as the Open Championship. Lose and it’s a relegation play-off in September.

How do we get tickets?

Despite over 20,000 tickets selling in around 10 minutes when they were made available back in November, there are now extra places available. See http://www.lta.org.uk/major-events/international-events/davis-cup/davis-cup-tickets/ for more details.
