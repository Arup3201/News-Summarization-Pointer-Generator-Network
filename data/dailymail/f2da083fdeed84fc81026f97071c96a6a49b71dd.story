Human brains might have a 3D GPS system which allows us to navigate around unfamiliar surroundings,  scientists have claimed.

They say we may possess cells that enable us to keep track of our direction, which can become disorientated when we come out of a subway station, for example.

And further understanding of the system could help us deal with effects such as vertigo.

A study by researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel found that mammals have head-direction cells that work like a 3D compass system. Researchers believe that humans might posses similar type of orientation cells. The findings could help pilots cope with the effects of vertigo (stock image shown)

The study, led by graduate student Arseny Finkelstein at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel and published in Nature, looked at cells in the brains of bats.

Earlier work by Dr Nachum Ulanovsky of the same institution had showed that bats possessed 'place' and 'grid' cells that work like a GPS system to keep track of their position.

That is similar to what is found in rodents, suggesting humans, too, also had the ability to map their position in 3D space. 

'We think that this work can be relevant to other mammals, including humans,' Mr Finkelstein told MailOnline.

'There is some evidence the human mind might have a similar system, but the exact mechanism of is still unknown.

Earlier this year a study suggested that bees rely on a built-in ‘sat nav’ system to find their way around.

Honeybees were found to make ‘mental maps’ of their home ranges allowing them to pinpoint destinations miles away from their hives.

While humans, sharks and even pigeons are known to use this technique, it was popularly thought that bees rely solely on the sun’s position to find their way back to their hive.

Dr James Cheeseman of Auckland University in New Zealand, said: ‘Only 50 years ago the claim any non-human animal had a cognitive map was deeply controversial because it suggested a computational theory of mind. The question of whether insects do is a frontier question.’ 

'Our research is the first in mammalian species that identifies this 3D system in the brain.'

The study of a bat brain shed light on how mammals orient themselves in complex environments by relying on neurons that work in three dimensions. 

This system acts as an internal compass that gives animals - including humans - a continuous sense of direction and location as they move around. 

They found certain cells respond to the bats' horizontal and vertical orientation and these so-called head-direction cells track direction in three dimensions as the bats manoeuvre.

These cells create a doughnut-shaped, 3D neural compass that gives a precise orientation - and even enables the bat to know if it is upside down or upright.

Similarly, in humans, pilots are trained to guard against a sudden loss of vertical direction - vertigo - that renders them unable to tell 'up' from 'down' and sometimes even leads to crashes.

Coming up out of an underground station can produce similar confusion - for a few moments you are unsure which way to go until regaining your sense of direction.

In both cases the disorientation is believed to be caused by a temporary malfunction of the brain's 3D compass. 

'In order to start understanding brain mechanisms for 3D orientation, we need to start by identifying the basic building blocks,' Mr Finkelstein added. 

In humans coming up out of an underground station can produce navigational confusion - for a few moments you are unsure which way to go until regaining your sense of direction (stock image shown). It is thought to be caused by a temporary malfunction of the brain's 3D compass.

The researchers described how the brains of bats contain neurons that sense which way the head is pointed to support navigation in 3D space.

Much research has been conducted on place and grid cells whose discoverers were awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

But until recently head-direction cells have been studied only in 2D settings in rats.

The researchers described how the brains of bats contain neurons that sense which way the head is pointed. Shown is an Egyptian fruit bat

So the researchers developed a tracking apparatus that allowed them to video-monitor all the three angles of head rotation - in flight terminology, yaw, pitch and roll - and to observe the movements of freely-behaving Egyptian fruit bats.

At the same time the bats' neuronal activity was monitored via implanted micro-electrodes which revealed, in a specific sub-region of the hippocampal formation, cells are tuned to a particular 3D angle of the head.

Certain neurons became activated only when the animal's head was pointed at that 3D angle.

The study also revealed for the first time how the brain computes a sense of the vertical direction integrating it with the horizontal.

In the brain compass these directions are computed separately at different levels of complexity - some operating in 2D and others in 3D.

The researchers believe the 2D head-direction cells could serve for locomotion along surfaces - as happens in humans when driving a car - whereas the 3D cells could be important for complex manoeuvres in space such as climbing trees or piloting an aircraft.

They said: 'Here we present the first evidence to our knowledge for a conjunctive representation of 3D head direction in the mammalian brain which may serve as a "3D neural compass."'

They say their findings should also apply to non-flying mammals including squirrels and monkeys that jump between trees - as well as humans.

Professor Britt Moser - one of the 2014 Nobel laureates - said: 'Now this blueprint can be applied to other species that experience 3D in a more limited sense.'
