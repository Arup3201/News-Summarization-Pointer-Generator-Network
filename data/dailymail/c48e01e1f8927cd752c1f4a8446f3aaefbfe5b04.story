Mark Miller has been jailed for almost nine years after he hid in his ex-wife's home to spy on her and tried to set fire to her father and his own son

A man hid in the loft of his ex-wife's home to spy on her before he tried to set his former father-in-law and three-year-old son on fire.

Mark Miller, 39, sneaked into the former marital home in Guisborough in east Cleveland and spied on his ex-wife after he refused to accept their 20-year relationship was over.

The 39-year-old blamed his wife's father for interfering in their breakup, and when he arrived in a car, also carrying Miller's three-year-old son, Miller attempted to set fire to them - spraying lighter fluid on his former father-in-law.

At a hearing at Teeside Crown Court Miller was jailed for eight years and nine months by Recorder James Brown, who told him: 'It is only by great good fortune that a catastrophe was avoided.'

Miller was caught hiding in the rafters of his wife's home, spying on her and their children, after using a key she did not know he had to let himself in.  

The court heard that around 10 years before the attack, when the pair were still together, Miller had become convinced his wife was having an affair and set fire to her bed, holding her in the room saying he wanted them both to perish in the blaze.

He was jailed for two-and-a-half years for reckless arson, but when he came out she forgave him and continued their relationship.

However Shaun Dryden, prosecuting, said Miller then drinking heavily, hiding alcohol around the house, gambling and demanded frequent sex or he would visit prostitutes.

In 2013 the pair split up and Miller began texting his estranged wife pictures pretending to hang himself, taking pills and of gravestones, threatening: 'I can get to your house quicker than the police can.'

He had previously been given a suspended sentence imposed for breaching a non-molestation order and a separate restraining order. This had banned him from contacting his ex-wife or coming within 200 metres of her home. 

But he breached this when he went to the house again last June as his ex-wife's father pulled up in his car.

Mr Dryden said: 'He approached the window and said 'This is the last f****** time you will interfere' and began flicking the liquid through the driver's window.

Teeside Crown Court heard that Miller sprayed lighter fluid onto his former father-in-law through a car window

'[The man's] shirt and trousers were drenched. He began trying to activate the windows to close them while the defendant fumbled with a lighter trying to light it.'

He was convinced Miller would set him on fire and the court heard he had 'never been so frightened.' 

In a victim impact statement read out in court, Mrs Miller I feel angry, ashamed and embarrassed by allowing myself and my children to be victims to this.

She said even though her young son was too young to realise what had happened, he remembered seeing his grandfather frightened as he argued with the boy's father.  

Miller, of Whitby, admitted attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, breaching a non-molestation order and breaching a restraining order.

Graham Silvester, defending, said: 'He regrets bitterly the hurt and anxiety he has caused his ex partner and her family. He was far from a well man when he undertook the course for which he falls to be sentenced. He is a hard working industrious man.'

Miller was also given an extended three year licence period.
