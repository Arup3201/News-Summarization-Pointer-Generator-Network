An elementary school in Massachusetts reversed their controversial decision to cancel their annual trip to see The Nutcracker because parents complained it had 'religious content.'

The Butler Elementary School in Belmont has a long standing tradition of going to see the classic ballet but parents complained to the school that there was a Christmas tree on stage and therefore was an inappropriate play.

WHDH reports that the cancellation was reversed after a PTA meeting on Tuesday night where several parents pushed for the school to change their mind.

Christmas controversy: Butler Elementary School almost cancelled their annual trip to The Nutcracker for fear the Christmas Tree on stage was inappropriate 

Upset parents said that the school cancelled the trip without telling anyone officially but that word eventually spread.

'I went once as a kid as well. I think it's anybody's choice. They should still offer it but you don't have to go if you don't like,' said parent Adam Campana.

'I've had four kids go to the school, my fourth is here, and they've done nothing but enjoy it,' said parent Laurie Manjikian.

Co-President Barbara Bulfoni told reporters, 'In the past years there were parent’s complaints as 'The Nutcracker' has a religious content. I think we clarified with the parents.'

One PTA board member said she was so miffed by the controversy that she may step down from her position.

Those who do not wish for their children to see the ballet are allowed to opt out.
