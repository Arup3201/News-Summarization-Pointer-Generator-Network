Paul Scholes has moved to further stoke the festering Raheem Sterling row by stating he hopes Brendan Rodgers didn't put the winger under pressure to pull out of the England starting XI.

The Liverpool man told Roy Hodgson that he was feeling tired just 24 hours before the win away in Estonia at the weekend - stirring a national debate on the legitimacy of ducking out.

The England manager opted to open up on the reasons for Sterling’s absence – a decision that hasn’t been met with widespread approval.

Of the players England used against Estonia, only Gary Cahill has played more minutes this season than Raheem Sterling...

RAHEEM STERLING 1079 mins

Jack Wilshere 1064 mins

Jordan Henderson 1035 mins

Calum Chambers 995 mins

Joe Hart 990 mins

But Scholes, writing in his Independent column, chose to question whether or not Rodgers had any influence over the weekend’s personnel changes.

'I really hope that there has been no pressure placed on him by Rodgers or anyone at his club to say that he was feeling tired or heavy-legged on Saturday,’ Scholes said.

'I really hope that his decision to tell Hodgson that he was not at his best was his, and his alone.' 

Sterling – who replaced club team-mate Jordan Henderson in the 64th minute in Tallinn - trained with Liverpool at Melwood on Tuesday and is set to form part of the squad to travel down to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday.

And while the Reds clearly want their players fit and ready for the rigours of the Premier League, Scholes is insistent they shouldn’t hold the national side to account if they are not.

Out of the players on international duty last week, only Chelsea’s Gary Cahill had played more minutes for his club this season.

The dark mood has intensified over the last month thanks to the stand-off between Hodgson and Rodgers over the fitness of striker Daniel Sturridge, who picked up an injury in training.

And the former Manchester United midfielder leapt to the defence of the former.

'That injury to Daniel Sturridge was not Hodgson's fault. It could have happened to any player from any club,’ he added.

'What has created the problem has been Rodgers complaining about the two-day recovery process in the aftermath of the injury.’

The England playmaker has had a great start to the season at Anfield with last year's runners-up
