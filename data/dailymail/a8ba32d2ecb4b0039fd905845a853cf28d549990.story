As a soldier, he survived the  snipers and roadside bombs that claimed the lives of comrades in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Tragically, in the apparent refuge of his home country, Fusilier Tony Emery’s life was cut short.

He was on leave following a family Christmas and days away from resuming military duties abroad when he was involved in a horrific road crash.

Injured: Miss Palmer, 20, suffered a broken neck, hip and pelvis in the crash and was rushed to hospital

Soldier: Fusilier Tony Emery, 24, was with aspiring model Paige Palmer when his red VW Golf overturned

He died in a poignant embrace with his
 girlfriend, who herself narrowly escaped death in the crash at an 
accident black spot nicknamed Devil’s Road. Paige Palmer, 20, suffered a
 broken neck, hip and pelvis when their VW Golf overturned after it was 
apparently undertaken on a dual carriageway and sent careering into a 
ditch.

A 22-year-old man, 
believed to have been test-driving a BMW, was arrested on suspicion of 
causing death by dangerous driving. He has been bailed until March.

Miss Palmer, an aspiring model and beautician, yesterday paid tribute to Fusilier Emery, 24, from her hospital bed.

Miss Palmer posted: 'RIP my soldier, we should have died together at least I got my last cuddle with you'

Description: Miss Palmer told relatives a BMW undertook the couple, forcing Fusilier Emery to lose control

She
 posted on her Facebook page: ‘RIP my soldier, we should have died 
together at least I got my last cuddle with you, seems not real all this
 I will miss you forever Tony rip.’

In
 another post, she said: ‘I should have died with him. The police said I
 was in his arms. It is not fair, I miss him.’ She also posted pictures 
of herself in a neck brace.

Fusilier
 Emery served with B Company of the Second Fusiliers and was based in 
Cyprus. He had been on three tours, including to Afghanistan and Iraq. 
He returned to his home town of Westhoughton, near Bolton, before 
Christmas and was due to resume duties on January 14.

Miss Palmer’s 
mother Karla, 44, said her daughter was lucky to be alive, adding: ‘Tony
 loved the Army and fought for our country everywhere. It’s terrible to 
think he lost his life back in the UK.

Recovery: Miss Palmer posted photos of her in hospital surrounded by relatives including her father (right)

‘You
 have to prepare yourself when they go to war and you know that’s what 
they have to do, but not on the streets when they are home.’

The
 accident happened on the northbound A666 at Kearsley, near Bolton, 
shortly after 11am on Monday. It is nicknamed Devil’s Road by locals 
because of its 666 number.

Miss
 Palmer told relatives a BMW undertook the couple, forcing Fusilier 
Emery, who had bought his car days earlier, to brake and  lose control.

His
 VW overturned and hit a lamp post, trapping Fusilier Emery, who died at
 the scene, and Miss Palmer inside. She is now recovering, but will need
 surgery for her injuries.

Fusilier
 Emery’s commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Taylor, from the 
Second Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, said the young soldier
 ‘was universally popular and much liked by his peers and his chain of 
command’.

'He will forever be remembered': Tony Emery's commanding officer, Lt Col Jim Taylor, paid tribute to the 'popular' soldier. He said his life was 'tragically cut short' and he will be remembered by his regimental family

‘He will forever be remembered by his regimental family,’ Lt Col Taylor added.

‘He will be painfully missed by everyone in the Second Fusiliers. He was a committed son, brother, uncle and soldier.’

Mrs
 Palmer said her daughter and Fusilier Emery were not officially a 
couple, but had become close in recent months. They met through Miss 
Palmer’s older brother, Craig, 25, and the young soldier had spent 
Christmas Day with her and her family.

‘They
 were very good friends,’ she said. ‘I loved Tony to bits. If you ever 
needed anything he would be there to help. He was always very happy.

‘Paige keeps saying “why aren’t I dead, why have I survived?” Everybody has been at her bedside.

‘Hopefully
 she will get up and be walking after the operation but it’s going to 
take a long time. She is very lucky to be alive.’

Fusilier Emery’s family were too upset to comment.
