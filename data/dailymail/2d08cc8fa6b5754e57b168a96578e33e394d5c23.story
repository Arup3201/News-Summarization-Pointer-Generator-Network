A woman was filmed by her boyfriend abusing his three-year-old daughter by yanking her from the bed by the hair and slapping her, which she left her covered in bruises.

She was found guilty of child cruelty and the offence of sexual touching by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court in Gwynedd today. 

And Judge David Hale said it was 'inevitable' that she would be have to spend time in jail.

Meirion Jones, for the defence, said the woman - who had no previous convictions - had been involved in a 'uniquely horrible event'. 

A court heard how the worried father put his BlackBerry mobile phone under his daughter's bed and left it to record.

He then listened back to the recording and heard his daughter crying and screaming.

The following evening, he left the phone in between cushions opposite the bed and activated the video camera.

A second mobile phone was placed under the bed to record the noise.

That night, the father recorded his girlfriend pulling his daughter up from the bed by her hair and slapping her. The three-year-old girl was screaming, sobbing and left bruised by the incident.

Her father said in a statement read to the court that he was 'shocked' and sickened' by what had happened. 

After the incident, he telephoned the police and ordered his partner to leave the house.

When he did so, she claimed to have done nothing wrong and said: 'Sorry, it was only once'. 

Remanding her in custody, Judge Hale said: 'There's bound to be a degree of local anger towards her.'
