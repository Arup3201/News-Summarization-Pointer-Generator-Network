Detectives have been called in to investigate unexplained injuries to dementia patients at a scandal-hit care home firm.

Three elderly residents suffered the mysterious injuries before the homes were ruled unsafe and evacuated.

Edna Slann, 89, has only weeks to live after developing an infection due to a severe bedsore that went untreated. 

Edna Slann is one of three residents left with unexplained injuries after moving into the care homes being investigated by police. The 89-year-old required stitches to her head and suffered horrific bruising 

The probe will lead to urgent questions over why patients had to endure months of appalling treatment before officials intervened. A damning report by the health watchdog – which could have alerted residents’ families – was not published for eight months.

There will also be fresh calls for a public hearing into the tragedy of an 85-year-old man who died 48 hours after the emergency evacuations. His death has been shrouded in secrecy, with officials refusing to name him despite the disturbing events leading up to it.

Last night, the Care Quality Commission watchdog was branded a ‘disgrace’ for not closing the homes sooner. Families said they had long had concerns about poor care at Merok Park in Banstead, Surrey, and Grantley Court in Sutton, south London.

But less than a year ago, both passed inspections by the commission. In the case of Grantley Court, inspectors did raise concerns over training and vetting of staff.

But this was hidden from families for eight months as the CQC forgot to publish it online.

Last night, Mrs Slann’s daughter Linda Cackett, 54, said she would never have let her mother stay at Grantley Court had she realised the CQC had already found faults with it. She added: ‘The whole thing is disgraceful. The CQC and local authorities should have been more vigilant.

‘How many other elderly people across the country must be suffering in substandard nursing homes?’

Grantley Court and Merok Park are both owned by Mauritian businessman Soondressen Cooppen, 51, and his wife Maleenee, 42. 

The couple, who own a £2million house on a gated estate in Cheam, are believed to have raked in £650,000 a year from each home. Families said the homes were run ‘on a shoestring’, with poor training and a lack of equipment. Grantley Court was criticised by CQC inspectors in January but this report was not published until September due to ‘administrative error’.

During those eight months, Mrs Slann and other vulnerable residents were placed at the home without their loved-ones realising there were issues. It was Sutton Council which eventually gave the order to rescue the residents.

Merok Park was given a clean bill of health in January last year, although families say it had been a ‘hovel’ for years.

In September, staff at Surrey County Council asked the CQC to inspect it after raising concerns. But it took more than a month after this inspection for its evacuation to be ordered.

On December 9, residents were left shivering in their pyjamas as the home was suddenly closed on one of the coldest nights of the year. Just 48 hours later, a man of 85 died. But the Surrey Coroner chose not to hold an inquest and his name is being kept secret.

Winifred Lake, 91, who died a fortnight after being evacuated from Grantley Court, will also not have her death investigated.

But it is understood police are probing injuries suffered by Mrs Slann and two male Grantley Court residents in their 80s and 90s. A Met spokesman said there had been no arrests and investigations continue.

The Home Office is also looking at whether Merok Park staff were working here illegally. 

Last month health minister Norman Lamb vowed to prosecute owners of homes that provided ‘shocking’ standards of care. The Cooppens were unavailable for comment.

Bruised, malnourished and given five weeks to life: Granny after two months in care home

Smiling for the camera and enjoying time with her family, Edna Slann was a lively and happy grandmother.

But a ten-week stay at one of Soondressen and Maleenee Cooppen’s nursing homes left the 89-year-old malnourished, badly bruised, scarred, and with an infection that will soon kill her.

The widow – who has been given just weeks to live – is emaciated at little more than 5st, bed-ridden, and heavily medicated with morphine to numb the pain.

Shocking: The widow has contracted a deadly infection after a bedsore went untreated while she was living at the home. Right, she is healthy before entering its care

She is one of three patients whose unexplained injuries at Grantley Court Nursing Home in Sutton, south-west London, are now are under investigation by police.

Her family believe her rapid decline was caused by the poor care she received at the home and branded the Care Quality Commission’s handling of the case a ‘disgrace’. 

Her daughter Linda Cackett, 54, told the Daily Mail: ‘To think of her suffering and in pain for those weeks is horrendous. We feel so guilty. 

'Had she not gone to Grantley Court she would still be getting up today and taking part in activities. She could have gone on for years.’

Outraged: Mrs Slann's daughter Linda Cackett says she would not have arranged for her mother to stay in Grantley Court had she been aware of concerns

Mrs Slann, who has dementia and was wheelchair bound due to arthritis, was moved from a residential home to Grantley Court in July when her health worsened. 

It is owned by Mauritian businessman Cooppen, 51, and his 42-year-old wife, who enjoyed lavish family parties in their homeland.

According to Mrs Slann’s family, she was neglected from the outset and her health deteriorated rapidly, causing her to lose more than half a stone in just two months.

Her daughter said Grantley Court staff did not keep records properly so she has had no explanation for how her mother came to need 12 stitches on her head and suffer severe facial bruising.

And she says her mother now has not long left to live because of an infected bedsore on her foot that was not treated properly.

When she was eventually taken to hospital, doctors said the only way to stop the spread would be to amputate her leg below the knee – an operation she was unlikely to survive.

Mrs Cackett, a book keeper from Epsom in Surrey, said: ‘The home was run on a shoestring. I’m surprised any residents survived.’ Mrs Slann was placed there in July by Surrey County Council, who allegedly told the family it was the only bed they could find.

The £595-a-week cost of her stay was met by Surrey Downs Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). In September, NHS officials moved her to a different home where staff found the bedsore on her foot and sent her to hospital.When they called Grantley Court staff to confront them, they were allegedly told it was ‘not that bad’.

Mrs Slann, a grandmother-of-one, worked as a cleaner until she was 70. A Surrey council spokesman said when Mrs Slann was placed in Grantley Court the home had passed its most recent inspection.

A Surrey Downs CCG spokesman said she had been relocated as soon as concerns were raised.
