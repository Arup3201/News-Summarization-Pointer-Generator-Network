Ships could be sailing right across the North Pole by the middle of the century, US experts predict.

By around 2050 the Arctic ice sheet will be thin enough for icebreakers to carve a straight path between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, it is claimed.

‘Nobody's ever talked about shipping over the top of the North Pole,’ said lead researcher Professor Laurence Smith, from the University of California in Los Angeles. ‘This is an entirely unexpected possibility.’

Meanwhile, cargo ships and tankers could routinely be making voyages through Arctic Ocean channels that are currently impossible for them to navigate on their own.

The scientists studied seven well-established climate simulations for the years 2040 to 2059 to estimate the future thickness of sea ice in the Arctic.

They then used a computer programme to look for potential new shipping routes opening up in September, the Arctic's most navigable month of the year.

By mid-century most common open-water ships will be able, without the help of icebreakers, to cross the Northern Sea Route hugging the coast of Russia, the forecast shows. The route is about 40 per cent shorter than plotting a course through the Suez Canal.

Sailing directly over the North Pole would provide a passage for icebreakers between the world's two greatest oceans which is 20 per cent shorter than the Northern Sea Route.

Even the fabled and notoriously treacherous Northwest Passage, which traces Canada's coastline, could be opened up to ordinary shipping, say the researchers. It is expected to become navigable for vessels which are strengthened against ice, and even some ships with unreinforced hulls.

Today, the Northwest Passage can only be crossed in one of every seven years on average, making it too unreliable for commercial shipping. But by 2050 the September sea ice is expected to melt to the point that it is accessible every other year.

For centuries the Arctic Ocean has captured the imagination of explorers because of the possibility of travelling between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans through the Bering Strait.

Until recently, thick ice has blocked this inviting short cut linking Asia with North America and Europe. But in the past two years, the ice has started to melt in late summer sufficiently to allow ordinary vessels escorted by icebreakers to venture into the Arctic. Last summer, a total of 46 voyages were successfully completed along the Northern Sea Route.

The new research is published online in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Scenarios assuming low-to-medium and relatively high increases in temperature both had the same dramatic impact on Arctic sea ice, the scientists found.

‘No matter what carbon emission scenario is considered, by mid-century we will have passed a crucial tipping point - sufficiently thin sea ice - enabling moderately capable icebreakers to go where they please,’ said Professor Smith.

The predictions have major implications for commercial shipping, the exploitation of natural resources and the jurisdiction of shipping lanes.

A more accessible Arctic could also fuel international disagreements, say the researchers.

For instance, Canada has long maintained that the Northwest Passage falls under its sovereignty while the US maintains it is an international stretch of water.

While the passage is essentially un-navigable, the issue is moot. But increasing accessibility could bring the US into a dispute with its northern neighbour.

The prospect of open-water ships entering the Arctic Ocean in late summer also heightens the need for international regulations protecting the environment and ensuring the safety of sailors, the researchers added.
