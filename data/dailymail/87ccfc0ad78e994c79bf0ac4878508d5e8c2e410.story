Released: Andy and Tracey Ferrie at the Belvoir hunt ball in March 2006

The couple arrested for opening fire on intruders who targeted their isolated cottage will not face charges, the Crown Prosecution Service announced last night.

Andy and Tracey Ferrie had been held on suspicion of grievous bodily harm after dialling 999 to report that they had discharged a shotgun when a four-man gang broke in to their home in the middle of the night.

The couple spent almost three days and nights in custody until they were released on bail late on Tuesday night.

Yesterday, hours after two men appeared in court charged with burglary in connection with the raid on the Ferries’ 200-year-old cottage, prosecutors said it was ‘clear’ the couple ‘did what they believed was necessary to protect themselves, and their home, from intruders’.

The decision was greeted as a victory for common sense by friends and relatives.

Mrs Ferrie’s mother, Hazel Towell, and her husband, John, called for a change in the law to give greater protection to property owners who defended their homes from intruders.

Mr Towell, 62, said: ‘It is terrifying, what happened to them.

‘What else could they have done? I feel so overjoyed the charges have been dropped.

‘Her mother has the weight off her shoulders.

‘This is the way forward. Police should have common sense.’

When asked about the people who raided his stepdaughter’s home, Mr Towell had previously told the Daily Mail he would have ‘blown their bloody heads off’.

Judith Walker, chief crown prosecutor for CPS East Midlands, said the department had advised Leicestershire Police to release Mr and Mrs Ferrie from their bail.

Taking notes: Police were first called to the property shortly after midnight on September 2, by homeowner Mr Ferrie

Mrs Walker said: ‘I am satisfied that
 this is a case where householders, faced with intruders in frightening 
circumstances, acted in reasonable self-defence.’

Relatives said Mr Ferrie, who runs a 
caravan repair business, and his wife, a saleswoman, were being looked 
after by police at an unknown location as detectives remained at their 
home at Welby, outside Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, last night.

A friend of the couple, who set up a Facebook support group after the shooting which had topped 18,000 members last night, said she was ‘relieved’.

She added: ‘If masked intruders go 
into somebody’s bedroom in the middle of the night then the householder 
has every right to defend themselves.’

At Loughborough Magistrates Court yesterday, Daniel Mansell, 33, admitted burgling the Ferries’ rented home.

Sally Cook, prosecuting, said: ‘It is 
no secret that a shotgun was fired at the property.’

She said 
stockily-built Mansell – who appeared to have his arm in a sling under a
 grey sweatshirt – was injured inside the property and arrested later at
 hospital in Leicester.

Mansell, from Leicester, was remanded into custody and the case was adjourned until September 25 at Leicester Crown Court.

Joshua O’Gorman, 27, gave no indication of plea and was remanded in custody to appear before magistrates on September 14.

Two
 other men, aged 23 and 31, who were arrested on suspicion  of 
aggravated burglary, have  been released on bail pending  further 
inquiries.
