He walked 2,000 miles across the U.S. and Canada in what was one of the longest-ever recorded journeys for a land mammal.

So it was unfortunate that the 140lbs mountain lion who made it all the way from South Dakota to Connecticut met a grisly end after being hit by a sports utility vehicle on a highway last month.

The animal originated in the Black Hills region of South Dakota and was tracked by DNA from its hair and droppings as it passed through Minnesota and Wisconsin in 2009 and 2010, officials said.

‘It is a testament to the adaptability of the species that it can travel so far from its original home in South Dakota to Connecticut,’ Connecticut environmental commissioner Daniel Esty said.

‘It’s a symbol, perhaps a signal of a stronger bounce back of some of our wildlife species,’ he told the Hartford Courant. ‘It was an incredible journey that ended in a tragic death on our highway here.’

He was the first confirmed wild mountain lion in Connecticut in more than 100 years, but was killed on June 11 when hit by a vehicle on the Wilbur Cross Parkway in Milford, Connecticut.

North America’s mountain lion population is estimated at 100,000, mostly living in western regions and seldom travelling more than 100 miles.

Authorities initially believed it was a captive animal that escaped, but tests showed it was not neutered or de-clawed and had no implanted microchips - commonly used in domestic animals.

Tests also determined the cat, aged between two and four years old, was likely to be the same one that had been seen earlier in Greenwich, Connecticut - a New York City suburb 30 miles away.

The death was followed by a flurry of big cat sightings in Connecticut, but experts dismissed most as unreliable. Officials believe no native mountain lions live in Connecticut.

Although it was an anomaly, Mr Esty said the presence of the wild mountain lion is a good sign of the ability of Connecticut's conserved land to sustain wildlife.

He said: ‘(The discovery is) a strong symbol of what we had all hoped for who work in the conservation area, that wilderness areas and biological diversity can be preserved and protected.

‘This guy had a really adventurous spirit.’

It’s believed the lion crossed a river in Connecticut. ‘Rivers do present a bit of a challenge for them,’ biologist Paul Rego told the New Haven Register. ‘Certainly not insurmountable, though.’

Genetic testing showed the cat had the same genetic structure of the mountain lion population in South Dakota's Black Hills region.

Genetics experts in Montana matched the DNA with samples collected from a cat spotted in eastern Minnesota near Minneapolis and in northern Wisconsin from late 2009 through early 2010.

It was unclear what route the animal took to Connecticut, but biologists said it could have travelled south near urban areas or north through Canada.

Several museums are now considering displaying the animal’s body, which is now in a freezer, but is still not known exactly why the lion decided to make the long journey.
