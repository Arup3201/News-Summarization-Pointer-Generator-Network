At first glance these images could easily be mistaken for photographs but they are in fact real life drawings created using nothing but coloured pencils.

From extremely intrusive close-up images to more creative sketches, these extraordinary works were made by American illustrator Morgan Davidson, 21, after she fell in love with drawing at an early age.

'There are two sides to my work,' said Miss Davidson.

Real life: These incredible drawings have been created by Morgan Davidson who uses colouring pencils

'On the one side I have a series of drawings that zoom in on the face, breaking the "personal space" bubble we always put up around us.

'On the other side, I have drawings inspired by the seasons, all vibrant and unique to the seasons they represent.

'My drawing kind of evolved as a coming-of-age comfort in early high school, when I was drawing everything made sense and nothing else mattered.'

All hand-drawn, Miss Davidson's life-size work can take her anything from 15 to 25 hours to complete.

Intricate: At first glance these images could be mistaken for photos but they are in fact pencil drawings

She said: 'My absolute favourite medium of all time is coloured pencil, I've always understood and preferred it since the first time I used it when I was 18.

'The first thing that people ask when they see my work is "is that coloured pencil?", then I always seem to get an amplified reaction when they realise it's hand drawn.

Morgan Davidson said people are always amazed when she tells them she has used colouring pencils

Traditionalist: Morgan's work can take up to between 15 and 25 hours to complete

'It feels nice in a modern age that people still support and admire traditional artists when digital art is becoming the norm, especially amongst younger artists.

'I think my message is based on the idea that we as humans are a part of nature, in a day and age where we seem to have forgotten that entirely.'
