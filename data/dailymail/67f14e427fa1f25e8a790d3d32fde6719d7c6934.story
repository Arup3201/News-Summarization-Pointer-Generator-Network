The teenager who was subjected to a horrific gang rape outside her homecoming dance by up to 20 different men took the stand yesterday to testify against two of her accused attackers.

It is the first time the victim, now 20, has made a public appearance since she was found by police in October 2009 naked, bleeding, beaten and urinated on underneath a picnic table.

Identified only as Jane Doe, she told jurors in Contra Costa County Superior Court that she did not remember drinking that night, nor being sexually assaulted, but said she still bears severe scars from the incident.Â 

Jose Montano, 22, and Marcelles Peter, 
20, each face life in prison if convicted of assaulting the girl in 
Richmond, California, after she left her high school homecoming dance.

Trial: In court drawings made yesterday, 'Jane Doe' is seen testifying against her alleged attackers Jose Montano, far right, and Marcelles Peter, third from left

Horrific: Earlier in the trial, the jury was shown pictures of the injuries 'Jane Doe' sustained from the attack, which included cigarettes burned into her back

Face off: Nearly four years after she was gang raped, the victim of the brutal attack took the witness stand for the first time to recount her memories before she awoke the next day in 'excruciating pain'

The two men showed no emotion as the 
victim testified that the last thing she remembers is leaving the dance 
because the loud music had given her a migraine and she was too hot.

She told the court she has a hazy memory of the attack but remembers getting kicked in the stomach and falling over, the San Francisco Gate reports.

'I remember not seeing anything because my eyes were closed and I was holding onto my necklace and getting kicked in the stomach,' she said.

She was repeatedly asked if she 
remembered drinking alcohol and said no, though the defense said this 
contradicted what she told police and medical staff after the attack. 
Nor does she have any recollection of the sexual assault or consenting 
to any advances.

'Jane Doe' was 16 when she was plied with alcohol, beaten, raped, stripped and urinated on after the October 24, 2009, dance.

She testified yesterday that she woke up in hospital the next day surrounded by medical staff with a neck brace and catheter.

'My head hurt, and I saw five of 
everybody staring at me. My body hurt from head to toe with excruciating
 pain every time I moved.'

Her legs 'felt like somebody had ripped them out of place' and she felt 
nauseated, 'as if someone had took out my insides, stabbed them and put 
them back in', she said.

Graphic pictures of her swollen face 
and bruised body were shown to jurors as she told them that to this day 
she still has scars on her back - the result of cigarettes being 
extinguished on her skin.

She said she did not recall seeing 
Marcelles Peter that night and 'barely' recognized Jose Montano and only
 then because of his long hair.

In chains: Earlier this week, suspects (from right) Elvis Torrentes, John Crane Jr. and Jose Montano walk to a preliminary hearing in Martinez. As many as 20 men are believed to have attacked the girl

On trial: Montano's attorney said while he witnessed the grisly attack, he had no part in it

In court: Peter initially said he was not at the crime scene, but later told them he only had a 'small role'

The woman received $4 million from the West Contra Costa County Unified School District though a civil claim in the case.

The victim testified at the beginning of the third week of the trial.

Last week a witness told the court the men were laughing and joking about the attack the next day.

The former high school student and friend of the men said: 'I was uncomfortable talking about the 
situation because it made me feel like that type of thing should never 
happen at any schoolhouse.'

The witness, who is not being named 
due to his fears for his safety, testified that Montano said he had sex 
with her and Peter said he violated her with his fingers. The third man,
 Ari Morales, said he urinated on her.

The
 witness, who was a freshman at the time, said he was at home when the 
attack unfolded, but attorneys pointed out this contradicted previous 
claims he had seen the assault and tried to help her.

But
 in court on Thursday, the man, who is now 19, said officers put words 
into his mouth. He added that he had originally avoided speaking to 
authorities as he didn't want to testify.

He explained that he was 'sort of afraid of what might happen' if he did.

The testimony came after other witnesses described the horrifying attack in 2009.

Contra Costa County Deputy District Attorney John Cope described earlier in the trial how police found the girl propped up by a 
metal beam under a picnic table half-naked and bloodied.

He explained how the girl, feeling bored and
 hot, had left the school dance and went outside to phone her father when 
she encountered a male classmate who asked her if she wanted to come and
 'party' with them.

After drinking brandy with the boys, things took a turn for the worst, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.

Witnesses will testify that the 
victim was punched, kicked and dragged around the area. She was 
assaulted with a walkie-talkie and someone urinated on her. Others 
watching were invited to join in.

As many as 20 men are thought to have
 participated in the attack, Cope told the jury, with one even answering
 the girl's cell phone and telling her father how good his daughter was 
at sexual acts.

Prosecutors also said how two condoms, a can of energy drink and a Four Loko were found at the scene.

Peter's
 attorney Gordon Brown told the jury in his opening statement that DNA 
evidence found in a condom at the scene was unreliable and that the 
crime scene had been compromised.

He
 said that wind from the helicopter could have compromised evidence at 
the scene and carried Peter's DNA from a beer can to a broken used 
condom found in the courtyard.

'I don't think we will ever know all that happened,' Brown told the jury.

She was 
'incoherent and barely conscious' and covered in alcohol, urine and 
dirt. Cope said Peter took part in the more than two-hour assault on the girl after she was plied with alcohol.

Jailed: Ari Morales, left, who told the witness that he had urinated on the girl during the attack, and Manuel Ortega, right, and agreed to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years respectively

'Participants': John Crane Jr, 43, left, turned 
himself into police after the incident and Elvis Torrentes, right, faces
 charges including aiding the act of rape that could land him in prison 
for 26 years

She had a blood alcohol level of .35 - four times the legal limit - and has no memory of the attack.

On Tuesday, the father of the girl also revealed the
 horrifying moment he received a vulgar call from his daughter's cell 
phone from one of her attackers boasting how good she was at sex.

Richmond police officer Todd Kaiser added on Thursday that he told the victim's father, who raced to the campus and searched for his daughter for about an hour, that he believed she had been raped.

The father started screaming and shaking a nearby fence as he struggled to deal with the news.

Kaiser said the owner of the fence told the devastated man: 'Hey, if you need to rip that fence out of the ground, you do what you have to do.'

His 
daughter passed by the man on a gurney and he saw her horribly beaten face and 
the vomit that was in her hair, the Mercury News said.

'I told her that we loved her very much and to hold on,' he said. 'I could see she was not conscious enough to respond back.'

Peter is charged with three criminal 
counts of forcible rape, rape by foreign object and forced oral 
copulation. Each count alleges that he acted in concert with others and 
inflicted great bodily injuries on the victim. Montano faces similar charges.

Manuel Ortega and Ari Morales agreed 
to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years, respectively. They are 
expected to testify against Peter and Montano.

'I wasn't the only one, there was hell of people,' one officer recounted Ortega saying in custody.

Two others, John Crane Jr and Elvis Torrentes, still await trial.
