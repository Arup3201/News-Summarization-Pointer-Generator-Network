A supplier which makes chicken dishes sold under Jamie Oliver's brand has been fined after people complained of 'nauseous' smells coming from one of its farms

A supplier which makes chicken dishes sold under Jamie Oliver's brand has been fined after people complained of 'nauseous' smells coming from one of its farms.

People living near Heale Farm in Kirkby on Bain, Lincolnshire, told the Environment Agency the smell surrounding the site had left them feeling 'sick and depressed'.

The BBC reports that Moy Park Ltd, the company which manages the site, has been charged with two breaches of environmental permit conditions.

It comes after 94 complaints were lodged by nearby residents between July 2008 and September 2011, The Daily Telegraph reports.

The company was fined £10,000 and ordered to pay cost of £42,500 in a hearing at Lincoln Magistrates' Court.

It said it had spent £400,000 over four years trying to combat the problem of the smell.

Moy Park produces ready-to-cook chicken dishes for a variety of companies.

They include Empire Chicken, Jubilee Chicken and American Style BBQ Chicken meals for Jamie Oliver's brand.

It is reportedly the second time Moy Park has been fined for an environmental offence, after a similar case at Sibsey, Lincolnshire in 2011 .

While Moy Park had been authorised to rear up to 156,200 broiler birds on a 37-day cycle, the permit also required the company to minimise its impact on the environment and local people, the court was told.

Magistrates heard that the company took steps in February 2011 to lower the number of birds on the farm and had made a slight improvement to the smell.

A company spokesman told the paper they were 'disappointed' by the ruling which relates to historical events from 2009 and 2011.

They added: 'We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously and strive to be a good neighbour.

'We believe we have taken all appropriate measures to mitigate potential odours at Heale Farm.'
