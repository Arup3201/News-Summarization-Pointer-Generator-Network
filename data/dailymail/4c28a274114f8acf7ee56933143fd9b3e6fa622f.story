'Disgraceful': Boxing writer and broadcaster Steve Bunce used a BBC radio spot to accuse a Northampton schoolboy of swearing at him and spitting at his wife

One of Britain's most high profile boxing journalists has accused a leading school of 'absolutely disgraceful behaviour' - claiming on live BBC radio that a student swore at him and spat at his wife.

Steve Bunce used the popular 5 Live show Fighting Talk to give a verbal battering to Northampton School for Boys, following an incident during a rugby match involving his son.

The state secondary's alumni include Matt Smith, the current Doctor Who, and several international rugby players.

The pundit, known as 'Buncey', said one of its teenage students walked up to them on the sidelines, swore at him and then spat in his partner's direction.

Mr Bunce's son was playing for Denstone College, a private school in Staffordshire with fees of up to £21,000 a year.

'I was standing there and suddenly this kid, a 17-year-old, called me the second worst word you can use on the BBC and spat at my wife,' he said on 5 Live's most 
popular show, listened to by more than one million people.

'I have discussed it with a number of people in the rugby world and they cannot believe it.

'I have been to six Olympic Games and thousands of sporting events 
during the 25 years I have been covering sport and I’ve never seen 
behaviour like it from a player.'

He added it was 'absolutely disgraceful behaviour' and said Northampton should be placed in the dictionary to represent everything 'naughty, outrageous or disgusting in 
sport'.

But after the school denied his 
version of events and accused him of 'provoking' their student, 5 
Live's acting controller Jonathan Wall has today apologised to headteacher Rod Goldswain.

Mr Goldswain, a former rugby player for Northampton Saints, says the boy spat at the ground,
not at Bunce's wife, and although he called him a 'stupid t***' the school 
denied the boy called him a 'c***' or a 'p****'. The pupil had been given a 'dressing down', he said.

After hearing his version of events Mr Wall wrote in an email seen by MailOnline: 'I have spoken to Steve Bunce today to tell him this was a private matter that he shouldn’t have raised on BBC Radio 5 live. It is not an issue he will discuss again on this radio station.

'As you know from our conversation, I’m sorry for the inconvenience this has subsequently caused you. Thank you for accepting my apology.'

Mr Goldswain said: 'I am happy to accept the apology, it would, of course, be good if Mr Bunce responded in a similar way.

'Unfortunately he (Mr Bunce) has used his privileged position as a BBC radio presenter to create what he sees as entertainment by criticising and naming a school and attempting to disparage both this school and our town,' he said.

'This is grossly unfair based, as it was, on one isolated incident. Those who know the school will not recognise the presenter’s comments applying to Northampton School for Boys.

'I would hope that Steve Bunce regrets the comments he made in the name of so called entertainment.'

Mr Bunce denies shouting at the boy but admitted today he should not have brought it up on Fighting Talk.

'I don't want the kid to get in trouble. I want him to be reprimanded,' he told the Daily Telegraph, adding: 'Perhaps I should have written to the school and not mentioned it on Fighting Talk.

'But perhaps some little kid shouldn't have gobbed or sworn at two people standing on the sidelines on a fantastic winter's afternoon in Northampton.'

A spokesman for the BBC told MailOnline this morning: 'This is a matter between Steve and the school.'

The school's local MP, Tory Michael Ellis, has also stepped in to slam Steve Bunce.

'It is ridiculous to use a national radio broadcast to launch a personal tirade against a teenage school boy and his school,' he said.

'Unlike Mr Bunce I know Northampton School for Boys to be an excellent school with strong standards of discipline.

'Mr Bunce’s broadcast comments about the worst behaviour he had seen in 25 years were, in my opinion, absurd and melodramatic.'
