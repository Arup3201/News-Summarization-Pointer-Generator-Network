These smashing pumpkins really are the scream of the crop as they light up the night in New York state this autumn.

A total of 10,000 super squashes are illuminating the evening across New York state as two exhibitions open to display the carved creations.

The first, called Pumpkinville, is located in Rhode Island's Roger Williams Park Zoo and features designs which encapsulate different regions of the US.

Taking eight weeks to create these pumpkins are on display at Rhode Island's Roger Williams Park Zoo and represent different regions from across America

The display includes celebrities like this iconic image of Audrey Hepburn from Breakfast at Tiffany's

Other political heroes such as John F Kennedy are depicted on the works which took eight weeks to make

The final display in the Zoo is named the laughing tree, and is the most spectacular of all

From the Heartland of America, Pacific Coast, Mid-Atlantic, New England, and Appalachian Highlands, the meticulously designed displays feature American heroes past and present

From Hollywood starlets Judy Garland and Audrey Hepburn, to freedom fighters John F Kennedy and Rosa Parks, there is even a moving tribute to the Sandy Hook shooting victims 

The designers, Passion for Pumpkins, will spend 30 days from October 3 until November 3 tending to the prized pumpkins, which are all lit with LED lights.

The artworks, like this one featuring rock legend Bruce Springsteen, are drawn with a permanent marker before special carving tools are used to add highlights

Rosa Parks, the rights campaigner who refused to sit at the back of a bus, is depicted on this squash

The pumpkins, like this one of Mark Twain, will be constantly altered and perfected throughout the exhibition

This image represents New York and features the Statue of Liberty towering over a street

The second display, The Great Jack 
O'Lantern Blaze, runs from October 5 to November 11 and and features 
gorgeous gourds made into a working doomsday clock, a spooky spider and 
several different dinosaurs.

The
museum of pumpkin art will also feature and exhibit entitled The Art of
the Pumpkin: Contemporary Sculpture Inspired by the Hudson Valley’s 
Legendary Squash, with work from 25 local artists chosen by a panel of 
experts.

All of the displays
have been individually hand carved and will be accompanied by backing 
music written specifically for the event by Richard Kristy who attended 
the event in previous years.

The Great Jack O'Lantern Blaze at Van Cortlandt Manor features 5,000 pumpkins including this spooky spider

The Jurassic Park themed exhibit features huge dinosaurs brought to life using electric lights

The museum of pumpkin art will also feature squash-inspired sculpture from 25 artists

Speaking about the Pumpkinville display, 
Roger Williams Park Zoo owner Paul Cadieux said: 'We usually start 
planning about 12 months in advance as the key to a successful pumpkin 
is knowing your ability so that you don't get frustrated.

'First
we start with an image and a black sharpie marker. The image is drawn 
on and then the highlights are etched out with our custom carving tools.

'The
team keep carving and enhancing the displays throughout the life of the
show - we expect to go through about 20,000 pumpkins during the course 
of the 30 day-run.  At the end, the pumpkins are collected and 
composted.

These before and after pictures show the pumpkins as they appear during the day and then the dramatic transformation that takes place at night

What a difference the day makes: black metal struts are revealed during the daylight making this web much less impressive compared to the night-time version which floats in mid air

Toil and trouble: each of the pumpkin sculptures are hand carved by a team of expert artists

'It really is a remarkable collection that everyone involved in is extremely proud of.'

The widely acclaimed Jack-O-Lantern Spectacular event uses pumpkin art to represent individual regions of the country, highlighting their unique attributes as well as historical and cultural landmarks of each of the states

And unsurprisingly there are zombie scenes stretching throughout the collection to celebrate Halloween.

The show's dazzling grand finale, the 
Laughing Tree, features half a ton of glowing Jack-o-Lanterns on the 
ground and high up in the trees surrounding carved giant pumpkins.

This witch symbolises Massachusetts and the Salem witch trials which happened there and made famous by Arthur Miller's play The Crucible

These voodoo zombies are illuminated by an electric light which shines through the skin which has been shaved away with a paring knife

Melman the giraffe from children's film Madagascar has been horrifyingly re-imagined as a zombie which forms part of the exhibit

Zombies are a feature throughout including these bizarre chickens which are back from the dead

The crew from Passion for Pumpkins, led by John Reckner, consists of full-time artists and many part-timers who use ballpoint pens, oil-based markers and paring knives to create spectacular pumpkin art.

Instead of cutting through the pumpkin, the crew shaves off the skin, then the bottom is cut out and the inside is cleaned, leaving the skin about a quarter of an inch thick.

This allows the light bulb to illuminate the image on the outside.
