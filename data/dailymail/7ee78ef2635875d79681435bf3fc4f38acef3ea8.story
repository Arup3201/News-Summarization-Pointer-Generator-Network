Plain cigarette packaging has no branding or advertising on the box, instead coming only with a plain description of the product and a large warning label

Unbranded cigarettes may not stop people from smoking according to new research in Australia where cigarette packets are already unbranded.

Industry data from Australia has warned plain packaging could lead to a rise in the sale of cigarette packs, because smokers, and potential smokers, will no longer care about buying expensive brands.

The industry data suggests the amount of tobacco delivered to retailers has actually risen since the move to plain packaging was introduced in 2012.

Health campaigners have been vying for the plain packages all over the world, saying the move will protect children and potential new smokers who are attracted to branded packaging.

The thinking is that potential smokers are less likely to buy packs of cigarettes if they are unbranded.

The data comes as leaders of the industry have announced that they intend to present an independent report to ministers, calling for a review of the banning of branded cigarette packs.

Philip Morris International, the manufacturers of Marlboro cigarettes, released data from Australia, which introduced the ban on plain packaging on December 1, 2012, which suggests that they have had a rise in deliveries of tobacco for the first time in five years.

Their data suggests that unbranded cigarette packets have reversed the downward trend of the fall in people buying cigarettes, and that people may potentially be buying more.

It says that in 2013 after a year of unbranded packaging, tobacco firms in Australia sold the equivalent of 21.074 cigarettes - a rise of 0.3 per cent after four years of bad sales, while the sales of loose tobacco used in roll-up cigarettes increased 3.4 per cent.

Health campaigners and anti-smoking groups previously said they were concerned about this potential result from instituting unbranded packaging.

However, they also say a ban on branded packaging is not enough, and that harsher taxes to increase the price of cigarettes should also be instituted to dissuade people even more.

The proposal for plain packs in the UK 
was intended to reduce the amount of children and teenagers that would 
ordinarily be drawn to smoking because of branded packaging, which can 
make a cigarette packet seem more attractive.

Parliament has been toying with the possibility of a UK ban, and in November 2013 they ordered an independent review of branded packaging to find out whether the ban would be effective.

However, so far the issue is still under consideration, and no date has been given as to when a ban might be introduced in the UK.

Currently branded packaging in the UK is still allowed, and the Government has not set a date for the potential ban of branded packaging.

However,
 parliament has been reviewing the issue, and have requested an 
independent review into whether banning branded packaging would be 
successful.

The key facts on tobacco sales in the UK are:

The
 Labour Party banned all advertising of tobacco products as a part of 
the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act in 2002, which banned tobacco
advertising in the following order:

The new data from the tobacco industry suggests that the plain packaging in Australia has actually increased sales of cigarettes and loose tobacco, the reverse effect from the agenda of plain packaging

The UK wanted to wait for the results of the Australian ban on branded packaging in 2012 before making a decision.

Deborah Arnott, director of Action on Smoking and Health believes that the data is a deliberate attempt to promote the agenda of the cigarette and tobacco companies.

She said: 'We are repeatedly seeing attempts to undermine the case for standardised packaging.

'It is about dissuading them from taking up smoking - and one year's data from Australia about delivery levels of tobacco tells us nothing about that.

Eoin Dadis, director of corporate affairs for Philip Morris in Britain believes that the implications that the data from his company bring to light need to be examined.

He said: 'If people are buying cheaper stuff, maybe they're smoking more of it.

'It's definitely a point of interest and that's something that absolutely needs to be explored because that's the counter of what this policy is seeking to achieve.'

Electronic cigarettes are classed as 'medicines' since tightened of nicotine-containing products

A new report from the university of California in San Francisco suggests that while e-cigarettes are promoted as aids to help people stop smoking, they are not stopping people smoking.

The study was conducted with data from 949 smokers (88 of the smokers using e-cigarettes at baseline) to determine if e-cigarettes were associated with more successful quitting or reduced cigarette consumption.

But the results were that more women, younger adults and people with less education used e-cigarettes, and that e-cigarette use among their test subjects did not reduce cigarette consumption or help people quit.

Rachel Grana Ph.D, the author of the study, said: 'Nonetheless, our data add to the 
current evidence that e-cigarettes may not increase rates of smoking 
cessation.

'Regulations should prohibit advertising claiming or 
suggesting that e-cigarettes are effective smoking cessation devices 
until claims are supported by scientific evidence.'
