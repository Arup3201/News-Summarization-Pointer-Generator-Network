A mother has spoken of her disgust after discovering her eight-year-old son was sent a string of sexually explicit messages while playing a children's computer game. 

Chantal Absolom was horrified when her son began receiving the comments from other players while using the internet game MovieStarPlanet on the family's laptop. 

The 32-year-old from Brighton fears the messages were written by adults as some of the language used was so explicit.

Chantal Bolsom's eight-year-old son was playing MovieStarPlanet when she stumbled upon a thread of comments titled 'dirt story' 

One of the comments asked the eight-year-old whether he would like to go 'on a date'.  

MovieStarPlanet describes itself as a game for children aged between eight and 15 where users can create their own characters and films. 

Among its features are online chat rooms where players can exchange messages.

'I was shocked and horrified when I saw the messages,' said Mrs Absolom. 

'It's very creepy, worrying and seems to be a hotbed for sexual conversation from children, and maybe adults pretending to be younger.

'There is no way some of the comments were written by children judging by the language used in the comments.

'I think people need to know the dangers and we shouldn't turn a blind eye, we should do something about it.'

The mother spotted the messages under a forum listed 'dirty story'. 

In the thread of comments, details of sexual encounters between young teenagers are described and reference was made to a 13-year-old girl who lived with an 'inappropriate uncle'. 

MovieStarPlanet offers users and parents extensive advice as to how to stay safe online, with the website's terms and conditions telling players not to post 'sexual or racist' comments. 

The game allows users to create their own characters and movies and share their favourite elements with other players

User guidelines and terms and conditions for the website state no adult is permitted to play the game 

Within its terms and conditions it states: 'MovieStarPlanet does not condone the use of the site by adults (those over 18 years). 

'Adults who do not meet the following criteria are not permitted to participate on MovieStarPlanet.'

When registering a new account, however no age verification functions are in place.

Mrs Absolom has since complained to the website and reported the incident to Sussex Police.

She now plans to set up a Facebook page to enable parents to highlight other websites they fear could be harmful to their children.

Mrs Absolom added: 'Clearly I should have studied the website more but I thought it was an innocent kids' game.'

Vernon Jones, head of safety at the Denmark based company MovieStarPlanet, apologised for the concern caused.

He said inappropriate posts were cleared from the UK forums and word filters were updated. 

Mr Jones added: 'The safety of children using the online community is of paramount concern.

'We are constantly developing new ways of dealing with inappropriate language and behaviour.'

He said the company 'does not hesitate to make changes' and sanctions users for posting obscene comments.
