They have become one of Britain's best loved gardens, complete with fountains, a Christmas orchard and an array of topiary.

But now, the Laskett Gardens in Much Birch, Herefordshire, will be destroyed after the National Trust said it would not preserve them because they were not important enough.

Sir Roy Strong, a former director of the National Portrait Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum, was so upset by the decision he decided he will not keep the garden open.

Sir Roy and his late wife Julia Trevelyan Oman spent more than 30 years transforming a field beside their home in Much Birch, in Herefordshire into the largest private formal gardens to be created in England since 1945

Sir Roy is so upset by the National Trust snub that he now plans to have the gardens 'destroyed' when he dies

Sir Roy designed Laskett, the largest private formal gardens to be created in England since 1945, with his late wife Julia Trevelyan Oman, a theatrical set designer. 

He began talks about leaving them to the trust three years ago, but he received a letter last month saying the offer had been rejected.

'The letter stated that the gardens did not reach the high rung of historical and national importance', Sir Roy told the Sunday Times.

'I'm so upset now that I have decided to change my will, stating that the garden will stay open to the public for one year after my death, and then be destroyed.'

He added: 'Not bulldozed as such, but I will ensure that all the personal aspects which really make the garden so extraordinary are taken away.

'It would be insulting to the memory of myself and Julia to continue to leave so many things which were dear to us if they are not going to be looked after by the trust.'

The gardens have been open to the public for two days a week since 2010 and visits are over subscribed

Sir Roy said: 'We married late. I was 35 and Julia 40. In a sense, the garden became the children we never had'

While Sir Roy has decided to leave 60 volumes of archives about the gardens to Oxford University's Bodleian Library, the gardens will be lost

Trevelyan Oman died from pancreatic cancer in 2003.  

Sir Roy said: 'We married late. I was 35 and Julia 40. In a sense, the garden became the children we never had. 

'The Laskett in Herefordshire was purchased as our home, and there was little or no garden. But there was a four-acre field attached to it that was let to a farmer for his cattle.

'Julia was already a gardener, and within weeks I became one, too, but the turning point came in 1974, when the farmer didn’t want the field for his stock any more. 

'So we began to plant our yew hedges and trees, to make borders and plant an orchard.'

Combining their prodigious talents, the couple spent the next 30 years transforming the field in to formal gardens with a rose garden, pleached lime avenue, kitchen garden and fountains.

The gardens also contain a temple dedicated to the Victoria and Albert Museum, an arbour in honour of Sir Frederick Ashton, the Royal Ballet choreographer with whom Trevelyan Oman regularly worked and a sundial from the estate of the photographer Sir Cecil Beaton. 

They have been open to the public for two days a week since 2010 and visits are over subscribed. It has been described by Stephen Lacey as 'one of the most important and interesting gardens in the 20th century.'

Sir Roy, pictured in his garden in 1993, had hoped to leave them to the National Trust as they would then be seen by many more people

Dame Helen Ghosh, the former civil servant who was appointed director general of the National Trust in 2012, sent a letter last month to Sir Roy explaining the decision

In a book published last year, Sir Roy wrote: 'The Laskett Gardens are unashamedly nostalgic and romantic and they are emphatically the creation of a marriage of equals...I know of no other English garden that resonates so forcefully with the lives of its two makers'

In response, the National Trust said: 'We were approached by Roy Strong to leave us Laskett Gardens in his will. 

'This was a very generous offer but when offered such a gift, our board of trustees considers it against strict acquisition criteria. 

'This includes making an assessment of the place's national and historical significance. 

'We believe the establishment of an independent charitable trust would be the best way to protest this much-loved place.' 

Sir Roy became assistant keeper of the National Portrait Gallery in 1959, and became its youngest director in 1967, when he was only 32, a position he held for six years. 

In 1973, aged 38, he became the youngest director of the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A), London.

He was in that post until his resignation in 1987 to pursue a freelance career in the media and as a writer and consultant. He was knighted in 1983. 

Over the years he has written extensively on the country's history and culture as well as on garden design. His more recent books include The Laskett, The Story of a Garden, Coronation, A Little History of the English Country Church and Visions of England.

He has lived in Herefordshire since 1973-74 and he and his wife conceived the Laskett garden in autumn 1974.

Sir Roy and Trevelyan Oman spent more than 30 years transforming a four-acre field beside their home into formal gardens. From April 2010, the Laskett Gardens have been open to the public.
