Chelsea captain John Terry has posted a snap of himself and a selection of his club teammates while on a boat trip in Austria.

Terry
 took to Instagram to reveal he was enjoying some time away from 
pre-season training with fellow Chelsea stars Gary Cahill, Nathan Ake, 
Patrick Bamford, Marco van Ginkel and Andreas Christensen.

Chelsea are currently on a pre-season tour of Europe with their latest game coming in Austria against RZ Pellets.

Back to action: Terry captained Chelsea in their pre-season friendly against RZ Pellets on Wednesday

Chelsea needed a late goal by Blues starlet Jeremie Boga to save their blushes and stop the west London from losing 1-0 to the Austrian outfit.

Mourinho's side went into the game on the back of victories against lower league opposition Wycombe Wanderers and AFC Wimbledon.

The next part of their European tour sees them take on Slovenia's NK Olimpija Ljubljana.

Aiming high: Terry will be hoping his side can challenge the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool for the title
