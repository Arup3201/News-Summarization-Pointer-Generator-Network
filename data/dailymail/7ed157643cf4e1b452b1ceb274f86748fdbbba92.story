Esteban Cambiasso got his Leicester City career off to a perfect start on Tuesday night as he netted in the Foxes' 4-0 friendly victory against MK Dons.

The former Inter Milan midfielder, 34, was making his first appearance in the blue shirt at Stadium:MK.

And he grabbed the third in a thumping win over the League One side, with Danny Drinkwater, Tom Hopper and Mark Albrighton also on the scoresheet.

Great start: Esteban Cambiasso scored on his Leicester debut in a friendly against MK Dons on Tuesday night

Victory: The Foxes, Premier League new boys, won the 'secret' game 4-0 at Stadium:MK

Star: Cambiasso has recently signed for Leicester after many years at Inter Milan in Serie A

The 'secret friendly' was set up to give many of Nigel Pearson's new signings a chance to feature in a non-competitive light.

Danny Simpson, Jamie Vardy and Anthony Knockaert also started in the match against an in-form side capable of beating Manchester United by the same scoreline.

Leicester's last Premier League game was against Arsenal, a 1-1 draw, and they arguably could have taken all three points.

Cambiasso was an unused substitute in that one having sealed a free transfer after his lengthy spell in Serie A.
