Kiev has been turned upside down by the bloodiest protests of recent European history and the stand-off between Russia and the West has left the Ukrainian capital in the biggest state of chaos since the Cold War.

As Ukraine's government grappled with Russia taking control of Crimea and armed pro-Russian separatists seizing government buildings, designers were quietly preparing for fashion week against all the odds.

In response to the unrest, the designers last week put on a series of eerie silent shows with pervasive political themes dedicated to those killed.

The show must go on: Designers at Ukrainian Fashion Week sent models down the runway with fake wounds as a reference to political tensions and the increasing death toll in the Eastern European country

Despite protests reaching 
crisis point and many international attendees choosing to stay away 
from Ukrainian Fashion Week, VICE travelled to Kiev in the days after 
the worst violence to witness these shows.

The project forms part of the Fashion Week Internationale series, 
which travels the globe exploring sociopolitical climates through the 
medium of alternative fashion weeks beyond the mainstays of London, New 
York, Milan and Paris.

In the latest short film, VICE host Charlet Duboc chronicles the struggles of Ukraine's creative industries dealing with a society on the brink of collapse.

Charlet visits the deeply contrasting 
scenes of a ravaged and barricaded Independence Square and a nearby 
ex-military building, which plays host to the 34th biannual Ukrainian 
Fashion Week.

The film 
portrays a city at odds: its infrastructure has been hugely damaged - yet Kiev's answer to Bond Street is still trading with Gucci, 
Bulgari and Louis Vuitton opening their doors.

According
 to a model walking in one of the shows, the decision to go ahead with fashion week allows Kiev's 
residents to 'take the attention away from the current situation'.

Many young designers use their work to express political frustrations; one designer, Frolov, steals the show with an ethereal collection but reveals he stopped production for a while to switch to making bullet proof vests for protesters. 

Another, Lilia Poustovit, explains that she wanted to give the people of Ukraine hope through her collection, which uses 'beautiful and uplifting' music.

Another designer, Igor, once owned a successful boutique which he was forced to shut down when revolution overwhelmed his street, but says: 'what's happening in this country is much more important than some shop.'

'Ukrainian designers are very courageous,' Iryna Danylevska, founder of Ukraine fashion week told The Guardian.

'Most
 of them were actively taking part in the protests. They were 
producing bullet-proof vests and helping in the kitchens, bringing food,
 water and medication. Naturally, they were not able to forget these 
experiences when it came to their collections.'

Ukraine's fashion scene has grown rapidly in recent years thanks to increasing votes of confidence from the mainstream industry - they now have their own version of Vogue - and the designers are regularly featured in British Vogue and the Financial Times.

However, the future of fashion is currently looking uncertain as designers struggle to maintain business in a country wrecked by violence.

Just yesterday, a mob of some 300 pro-Russian 
militants seized control of the prosecutor's office in the eastern 
Ukrainian city of Donetsk after hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails at 
police.

Several of the 100 
police officers guarding the building were injured and in some cases 
severely beaten as the crowd stripped them of their weapons and shields.

Rebels
 quickly took control of the building after mounting a second assault 
from the back, hoisting the Russian flag, barricading the front door and
 burning Ukrainian symbols in the street.

The
 outnumbered police injured some rebels as they responded with stun 
grenades, tear gas and rubber bullets, but were quickly overpowered.

The clash, the latest 
unrest in the increasingly lawless east of Ukraine, erupted after what 
started as a peaceful demonstration by some 10,000 pro-Russian 
supporters in Donetsk.

Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has thrown a $17billion lifeline to recession-wracked Ukraine.

IMF
 chief Christine Lagarde said 'urgent action was necessary' to prop up 
the economy, which the fund predicts will shrink by 5 per cent this year
 as the crisis takes its toll on industry and consumers.

The
 immediate deployment of aid may also help Kiev pay a bill to Russian 
state-owned gas firm Gazprom the company calculates at $3.5billion. 

Russia
 has threatened to turn off the taps to Ukraine - and by extension to 
several European countries - if the bill is not paid in full, amid the 
worst East-West showdown since the Cold War.
