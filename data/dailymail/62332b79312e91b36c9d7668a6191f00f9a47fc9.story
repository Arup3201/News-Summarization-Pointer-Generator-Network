A managing director who asked his openly gay employee if he had AIDS when he saw that he was ill at work dismissed the question as 'office banter' at an employment tribunal hearing.

Office manager Jack Howell, 36, said he was 'mortified' when his boss Peter Chambers made the comment after he had came out of the toilet looking pale and sweating.

Mr Chambers, who founded Chambers Waste 
Management Plc in 1964, accepted at the hearing today that the AIDS 
comment was 'inappropriate' but said it was part of 'office banter' at 
the firm of 120 people he runs with his wife Emma.

He also admitted calling Mr Howell a 'c*** sucker' in a phone call to his wife, but said he was not his 'usual self' that day as he had been at a coroner’s inquest into the death of his father who had died in an accident months earlier.

The company denied discriminating against Mr Howell and counter-claimed that he had made disparaging comments about Mrs Chambers in a Facebook post.

The tribunal heard Mr Howell had been working as the skip office manager at the recycling and waste management firm for almost three years when his relationship with Mr and Mrs Chambers soured.

In April last year, Mr Howell fell ill and was diagnosed by his GP with Raynaud’s Phenomenon - a condition that affects the blood supply to parts of the body.

He said: 'Although I had returned to work after my doctor’s appointment, I was still not feeling well and, as I was walking down the stairs, Mr Chambers said to me: "What’s up with you?"

'When I mentioned that I was feeling really rough, he commented: "What’s wrong with you, is it AIDS?”'

Under cross-examination, Mr Howell said he was 'mortified' by what his boss had said, adding: 'I was horrified. I’m a gay man and the stereotype is still there - that it is a gay illness.'

Mr Howell claimed colleagues were shocked when he told them about the AIDS quip and that Mr Chambers started to ignore him from then on.

He said he didn’t raise a formal grievance because his line manager was Mr Chambers’ wife Emma, who is finance director at the firm based in Guildford, Surrey.

The tribunal heard the company was struggling financially and had suffered a £150,000 loss in the year ending April 2013. Its fortunes have since improved.

Mr Howell, who was responsible for selling skip hire, had suffered a drop in sales and was called to a meeting with Mrs Chambers on May 14 to discuss his falling revenues.

It was alleged that later that day he called Mrs Chambers a 'retard' in a Facebook post, which was seen by her husband.

The couple claimed they decided not to take action against their employee at the time because she was not mentioned by name.

However, Mr Howell told the tribunal his online comment simply referred to him falling out with his drug-addicted brother - and was not about Mrs Chambers.

Two weeks later, Mr Howell was called back into Mrs Chambers’ office and informed he was at risk of redundancy because the company no longer needed a skip office manager.

Following a further consultation on June 3, Mr Howell accessed the company’s recorded phone logs and listened to calls made between Mr and Mrs Chambers - where he heard Mr Chambers refer to him as 'the c*** sucker'.

The tribunal, in Reading, Berkshire, heard office phone calls were recorded for training purposes and could be accessed by supervisors.

Mr Howell saved recordings of several key private conversations between the couple, and transcripts were put before Employment Judge Andrew Gumbiti-Zimuto at the tribunal.

A recording of a call made on May 21 heard Mr Chambers tell his wife he wanted to put Mr Howell in 'an uncomfortable and embarrassing position' by making her report the Facebook comment to the police. No complaint was ever made.

After Mr Howell was informed he was at risk of redundancy on May 28, the tribunal heard Mr Chambers phoned his wife to see how the meeting had gone.

Claims: Mr Howell says Mr and Mrs Chambers had decided they wanted him to leave the company either because of his sexual orientation or his alleged misconduct

He said that Mr Chambers had referred to him using the slur when he asked his wife about the meeting.

'Mrs Chambers stated that I was "oh, so nice. You would not believe it," and that I was "good as gold" in the meeting that day,' he said.

'That apparently surprised Mr Chambers who then commented, "don’t they turn?" Presumably he was referring to homosexuals.'

Mr Howell, of Deepcut, Surrey, left the office on June 3. He was signed off work and prescribed anti-depressants before formally handing in his resignation on June 28.

He told the tribunal panel his trust and confidence in the Chambers had 'ended' and that he was placed in an 'impossible situation.'

'Mr and Mrs Chambers had decided they wanted me to leave either because of my sexual orientation or my alleged misconduct,' he claimed.

'I could not stay in view of the homophobic comments made by Mr Chambers and the attempt to ease me out of the company on the false claim of redundancy.'

Mr Chambers denied he was homophobic and dismissed Mr Howell’s claims that he had engineered the redundancy scheme to force him out of a job.

Referring to the AIDS comment, Mr Chambers said: 'I saw Jack coming out of the toilet looking very pale and sweating. I asked him: "Are you okay, Jack? You don’t look very well."

'He laughed and replied that he was okay and then I asked him, jokingly: "Christ, Jack, you haven’t got AIDS have you?"

'With hindsight, I appreciate that this comment was inappropriate. However, this was a response to the way Jack looked and not a reference to his sexuality.

'It was only afterwards that it occurred to me that the comment could be taken as a reference to Jack being gay. At the time, it was not calculated at all.'

Mr Chambers said Mr Howell did not raise a grievance and did not seem offended by his comment at the time.

He said the office had a 'whimsical' atmosphere and 'many of our employees like to have a laugh and partake in office banter.'

Turning to the comment about Mr Howell made to his wife he added: 'I understand that this phrase is offensive and inappropriate but at the time I was extremely emotionally distressed and I was speaking - I thought in private - to my wife.

'I regret my use of this phrase but I did not use it because of any prejudice against homosexuals, but rather as a general term of abuse.

'This comment does not accurately reflect how I really viewed Jack or acted towards him.'

Giving evidence, Mrs Chambers said her husband’s words to describe Mr Howell was 'not deeply offensive in the world of transport.'

She added: 'I think it had no reference to him (Mr Howell) being gay. I think he could have chosen his words better.'

In her witness statement to the tribunal, Mrs Chambers said she did not know how Mr Howell had obtained the password to access the recordings, and that she felt her privacy had been 'violated'.

However, Mr Howell said the phone recordings were readily accessible to all staff members.

Mrs Chambers accepted that the company did not have a social media policy in place in regards to the Facebook post Mr Howell wrote on May 14.

The tribunal continues.
