The board showing two added minutes had just been held up and Croatia set about trying to salvage some pride.

But the more those in blue shirts chased the ball, the further away it went.

England, bursting with confidence and belief, were tormenting their hosts, sending them dizzy with possession as they dumped them out of Euro 2015.

And to think they say England never win with style. 

With the stakes high and the pressure intense, England secured a place at next summer’s Under 21 European Championship in a very un-English way.

There was no scrapping, no backs against the wall, no bitten fingernails, just the smooth execution of meticulous planning and preparation.

Thanks to goals from Leicester’s Liam Moore and Derby midfielder Will Hughes, giving them a 2-1 win on the night — 4-2 on aggregate — Gareth Southgate’s squad will head to the Czech Republic next summer as one of the favourites to lift the trophy.

As England were victorious in Vinkovci, playing football as it should be, Spain — winners of this competition in 2011 and 2013 — were falling by the wayside, as were Holland. Do not underestimate what an achievement it is to be in the finals of this tournament.

Southgate has not put a foot wrong in the last 13 months and this game saw everything he has been working towards fall into place. England, even without many key players, dismantled Croatia and in the process laid down a blueprint for the future.

Vinkovci, famed for being the town where the train broke down on Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express, may have been a surprise destination for this game, but the hosts were welcoming and there was no sinister edge, as had been the case in Krusevac when England faced Serbia two years ago.

Croatia almost had the perfect start, too. With just two minutes gone, they broke swiftly down England’s left and Marko Pjaca crossed for Mario Pasalic, who seemed certain to score with a right-foot half-volley, until Jack Butland intervened.

Butland cannot get a game for Stoke but he is a cornerstone of this England team and the captain showed his worth with a magnificent instinctive save to thwart Pasalic.

Given the delicate balance of this contest, it was a moment of great significance.

Croatia had been bolstered by the presence of Barcelona B midfielder Alen Halilovic, one of the finest young talents in Europe. He had warmed up for this by playing 30 minutes for Croatia’s senior side on Monday night against Azerbaijan.

England, however, swiftly got back on an even keel and began passing the ball in the manner Southgate desires. They had willing runners, particularly in the shape of the eye-catching Nathan Redmond, and a belief they could cause Croatia problems.

So it proved. In the eighth minute, a corner that had been won by the tenacity of Hughes was swung in by Tom Carroll and met flush on the volley by Moore, who jubilantly wheeled away after his shot had hit the roof of Croatia’s net.

Moore had silenced the home supporters and given his team the confidence to look for the second goal that would have killed the tie.

It should have arrived in the 36th minute when Hughes surged into the area, but seemed reluctant to shoot. The ball fell to Redmond but his effort was straight at keeper Dominik Livakovic. In the next attack, a long ball was hit up field by Filip Bradaric and, as England’s defence dithered, Marko Livaja nipped in to score. Now Halilovic began to impress. One ball he played with outside of his left foot to launch an attack, having not broken his stride, was majestic.

But half-time gave England the chance to regroup and they began the second period with a renewed sense of calm. This was England’s biggest test, but they were passing it with style.

Saido Berahino might have won it in the 59th minute but his shot smashed against the post. No matter. Not long after, the outstanding Hughes waltzed forward and finished with aplomb. Cue celebrations. It was his 13th game and 10th consecutive win. And, for Southgate, it was just about perfect.
