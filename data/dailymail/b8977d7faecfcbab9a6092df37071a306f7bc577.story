A nine-week-old baby boy has been left orphaned after both his parents died in a car crash.

Raquel Davies, 23, and Lee Jenkins, 25, were in a friend's open-top BMW when the car left the road near the village of Tonyrefail, south Wales, killing them both.

Tributes poured in to the pair, who had their first child in April, as police arrested the 20-year-old driver on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

The couple, from the nearby village of Porth, had recently become engaged to be married and their families said they loved each other 'immensely'.

Just nine weeks ago Ms Davies gave birth to her son Harley, the couple's first child.

Both were passengers in a white BMW 1 Series convertible on Saturday during the fatal crash just after 10.30am.

Police said the car left the village of Gilfach Goch and joined the A4093 through the Welsh valleys, passing the village of Hendreforgan before it left the road.

It is believed the open-top car rolled upside down in the crash. Both Ms Davies and Mr Jenkins died at the scene.

The driver, 20, survived and was today arrested on suspicion of causing their deaths by dangerous driving.

Police said no other vehicles were thought to be involved.

Ms Davies' family released a statement through South Wales Police, which said: 'She was perfect in every way and was a devoted mother to her young son.

'She would help anyone out at any time and was a beautiful person inside and out. She loved her fiancé immensely.'

Her fiancé's family added: 'He loved his fiancée Raquel dearly and was enjoying being a new dad to Harley who is just nine weeks old.

'Lee was a keen and talented footballer when he was younger.

'She was perfect in every way and was a devoted mother to her young son. She would help anyone out at any time and was a beautiful person inside and out'

'We are heartbroken at the loss of Lee and will cherish all the great times and wonderful memories he gave us.'

Police are investigating the crash and appealing for witnesses who saw the car in the moments before it happened.

A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'We have viewed CCTV footage and believe that people in a number of vehicles, including two buses, may have seen the car in the moments before the accident.

'Potential witnesses include the occupants of a silver Volkswagen Passat, and what is believed to be a dark Renault Clio travelling from Gilfach Goch to Tonyrefail behind a bus.

'Travelling in the opposite direction, from Tonyrefail towards Gilfach Goch, again behind a bus, was what was believed to be a dark Hyundai Santa Fe, a silver Citroen Picasso, a white Mercedes C Class Estate, a black Volkswagen Beetle, and a silver Vauxhall Vectra.'

The spokesman added: 'Specially trained South Wales Police officers are providing support to both families at this difficult time.

'A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and is in police custody.'

Witnesses should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
