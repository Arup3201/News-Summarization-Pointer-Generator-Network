Firms fear if they cut prices ahead of the winter, a victory for Ed Miliband next May would see them forced to stick with these new tariffs

Energy giants are refusing to pass on lower wholesale gas prices to customers ahead of the General Election in response to Labour’s threat to impose a price freeze.

The firms fear that if they cut prices ahead of the winter, a victory for Ed Miliband next May would see them forced to stick with these new tariffs for at least 20 months.

The net effect means that Labour’s price promise freeze – which it heralded as the key part of its drive to help struggling families cope with increases in the cost of living – has backfired spectacularly.

The wholesale price of gas to be supplied next winter is down by around 20 per cent compared to the winter of 2013-14, and this reduction, which could be worth £50 per household, would normally be passed on.

Wholesale electricity costs are down too – the two are inextricably linked because gas is used to fuel some power stations.

However, one of the most senior executives at a ‘big six’ energy supplier told the Daily Mail: ‘We don’t expect to see any reduction in tariffs this side of the General Election.

'If you have the prospect of a 20-month price freeze should Labour win the General Election, energy companies will not want to be locked in to a lower price.’ 

He added: ‘To some extent, the decision on whether to pass on the lower wholesale price depends on the polls. If they point to a Labour win, then reductions in bills are unlikely. If Labour is falling behind, the industry may feel they are safe in making reductions.’

The result of the Labour price freeze promise and the industry’s response is that bills are likely to be artificially inflated all through next winter.

Some City analysts had already warned that Labour’s policy would backfire, however the admission from the energy industry insider is proof positive that this is the case.

Peter Lilley MP, the former Tory Cabinet minister and a member of the Commons Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, said: ‘This was always a fear when Labour announced their proposal.

'The concern was that companies would resist any downward pressure on prices ahead of an election.

‘It seems that prices are being held higher than necessary at the moment and if Labour were to win the election they would be frozen at this higher point for 20 months afterwards.

'Effectively, the shadow of a possible Labour government is having very serious negative consequences for consumers and the wider economy.’

Energy analyst Peter Atherton, of Liberum Partners, previously warned that Labour’s price freeze would lead to higher, not lower, prices.

‘This doesn’t surprise me at all,’ he told the Mail yesterday. ‘There should now be scope for price reductions, and if we were in a normal and non-political environment you would be very confident of material price reductions in the autumn.’ 

He said the net effect would be that energy companies would seek to buy large amounts of gas and power ahead of 2015/16 to protect them against the impact of a price freeze.

As a result, he said: ‘Costs to consumers are very likely to be higher than they otherwise would be.’

The industry regulator Ofgem is alarmed that energy companies have failed to pass on the recent falls in wholesale costs to customers. 

It has referred the industry to an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority, which will investigate allegations of profiteering. However, it has no power to force the firms to cut tariffs now.

Recent figures from Ofgem show the average annual profit margin the big six energy firms are making per customer has more than doubled in the past year to £101. 

Labour MP John Robertson has called for massive fines if any of the companies are found guilty of rigging the market and bills.

He said: ‘If they are found guilty, the tens of millions in fines should go straight back into the pockets of consumers who have been ripped off all these years.’
