A terrified dog that was left for dead in a park with his legs tied up with electrical cables has found a new home after the ordeal. 

Spencer, a boxer cross, was found abandoned and with his legs trussed together in a park in Norwich and had to be rescued by police earlier this year. 

The animal was taken to a rescue centre after the ordeal but now appears relaxed and happy with his new owner Simon Oddy. 

Simon Oddy has given Spencer the boxer dog, who was found abandoned in a park in Norwich with his legs tied with electrical cable so he could not stand, a new home in Peterborough and said he seems happy

Mr Oddy, 37, of Peterborough in Cambridgeshire, decided to adopt Spencer after he learned of his ordeal online. 

'I just love him to bits,' said Mr Oddy. 

'You wouldn't have thought Spencer's been through such a traumatic experience.

'He's so placid and happy.'

Spencer was rescued on August 30 after police were called to Sloughbottom Park following reports of a dog that had been hog tied.

He was found bound with household electrical cable and with his collar tied up with string and binding his legs so he could not stand.

Spencer was discovered hog-tied in August, with household electrical cables binding his feet together 

Spencer was named after the police officer who put his coat around the rescued animal to keep him warm 

The dog, believed to be around four years old, was named after the police officer who found him and put his coat around the animal to keep him warm. 

Mr Oddy added: 'As soon as we saw him on the website we wanted him - he charmed us instantly.

'We hadn't heard then about his terrible past, but we looked at the links and saw the story and it just made us want him more.

Spencer is now relaxed and happy in his new home 

'It is amazing how trusting dogs can be - they seem to move on and forgive and forget so quickly.

'Most humans would be slow to trust if something like that had happened to them.

'But Spencer just wags his tail and bounds over in his friendly way to all he meets.'

Mr Oddy, whose parents run an animal rescue centre in Northampton, said he wants to encourage other people to adopt rescued animals like Spencer.  

Spencer was taken to an RSPCA centre for specialist care after he was found. 

Laura Sayer, an inspector with the RSPCA, said she was 'delighted' that Spencer had found a new home after his ordeal in the park, when the animal had been left for dead. 

She said: 'He is such a lovely dog and was so sweet and loving from the word go that it does not surprise me that someone fell in love with him so quickly.

'It is the best part of our job when we reach such happy endings - it just makes everything so worthwhile.'
