An Oregon woman who accidentally ran over two little girls playing in a pile of leaves in October - but failed to report the incident to authorities - was found guilty on Wednesday of two counts of felony hit-and-run.

Now, 19-year-old Cinthya Garcia-Cisneros faces up to three years in state prison for fleeing the fatal wreck and not reporting it to the police.

On October 20, Garcia-Cisneros was driving the SUV that struck and killed step-sisters Anna Dieter-Eckerdt, 6, and Abigail Robinson, 11, as the girls were playing in a leaf pile on Main Street in Forest Grove, about 30 minutes west of Portland.

Guilty: Cinthya Garcia-Cisneros weeps as she's found guilty of hit-and-run in the deaths of two young girls

Sentence: Judge Rick Knapp could sentence Garcia-Cisneros to any thing from probation to three years in prison

Dieter-Eckerdt died at the scene. Robinson was taken to a hospital in Portland where she later died.

At trial, Garcia-Cisneros testified that she was driving home from picking up fast food with her brother and boyfriend when she saw the leaf pile and intentionally swerved to hit it.

Garcia-Cisneros told the jury that she heard a bump when she hit the pile or leaves, but insists that she didn't realize that she'd hit the two girls.

Even prosecutors agreed that Garcia-Cisneros didn't intentionally hit the girls, according to the Oregonian newspaper. But what she did after the fact is the reason she currently is looking at three years in prison. 

After she'd returned home, her brother hopped on his back and rode it back towards the pile of leaves. That's where he saw Tom Robinson - Abigail Robinson's father - standing over the two girls.

Robinson had been outside taking 
pictures of the girls outside of their home when he briefly went inside 
to put away the camera and send a text message to his wife.

When he went back outside, he heard a thud - and couldn't find the girls.

'The only thing I could think is, the girls are in the pile of leaves,' Robinson told the jury.

When
 Robinson walked over to the leaf pile, he saw the girls and called 
9-1-1. When Garcia-Cisneros' brother got to the scene, he saw Robinson 
screaming.

The teen then went home and told his sister that she hit the two girls.

At
 that point, Senior Deputy District Attorney Bracken McKey told jurors, 
is when Garcia-Cisneros' legal obligation to assist the victims and give
 information to authorities began, according to Oregon's hit-and-run 
laws.

Garcia-Cisneros' 
attorney, however, argued that she had no legal obligation to do 
anything because the law doesn't say anything about the duties of a 
driver who learns of an accident after the fact.

Additionally,
 he claimed, Garcia-Cisneros was in a state of shock after she learned 
she'd hit the girls and couldn't reasonably be expected to do anything.

'She couldn’t do anything except avoid and disbelieve,' he told jurors.

According
 Garcia-Cisneros, just minutes after her brother told her that she'd hit
 the two girls, the three teens went to the home of her boyfriend, 18-year-old Mario Echeverria.

She
 told jurors that the three needed a distraction from the tragic 
incident earlier in the day and used a different car to go and get ice 
cream and then to go to Walmart.

The
 next day, Echeverria took the SUV Garcia-Cisneros was driving when she 
hit the two girls to get washed in an attempt to get rid of any evidence
 that it was involved in the tragic hit-and-run death of the two young 
girls.

Authorities were
 alerted to Garcia-Cisneros' involvement in the wreck after a neighbor 
of the teen saw her sobbing while examining the outside of the SUV the 
night the girls were killed. Police tracked her down at Echeverria's 
house the following day.

Echeverria also was arrested. He pleaded guilty to hindering prosecution in December and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.

Garcia-Cisneros’
 sentencing hearing was scheduled for Jan. 31, at which point Judge Rick
 Knapp could sentence her to anything from probation to three years in 
prison.
