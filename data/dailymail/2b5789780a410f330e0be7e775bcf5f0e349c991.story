Freddie Selby, five, has a rare heart condition and was given just given six months. But three and a half years later he is still battling on

A young boy who doctors said would die within six months because of a rare heart condition has defied the odds for over three years.

Freddie Selby was born with a condition which affects his heart's valves and surgeons said his condition was too serious to operate on.

Given only six months to live, Freddie simply refused to die and has managed to defy the odds every day for the past three-and-a-half years.

Born with supravalvar aortic stenosis - a heart defect 
that develops in the womb - the condition causes a narrowing of the large blood 
vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body.

Doctors told mum Kirsty, 40, that they could not operate on Freddie and he would die within months.

Speaking to The People, Kirsty, from Hull, said: 'The doctors have said they can't believe he's still here.

'I was told, 'He probably only has a few months The outlook is very, very poor.'

Yet Freddie has defied doctors bleak outlook and continues to baffle hospital consultants and specialists.

Doctors were able to treat Freddie's 11-year-old sister Amelia, who was born with the same condition.

She recovered well after open heart surgery when she was only three.

When Kirsty found out Freddie had the same condition after a routine check-up in May 2009 she remained optimistic after seeing how feel Amelia pulled through.

But she didn't know that some sufferers have additional defects in other blood vessels.

While Amelia's condition was concentrated to only one place, Freddie has it in nine, making it much more difficult to treat.

Kirsty said: 'We are just hoping and praying for another miracle, just like the one that happened for Amelia.'
