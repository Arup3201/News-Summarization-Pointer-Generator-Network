For nine years, Lucy Phasey longed to become pregnant.

Told she could not conceive naturally because her immune system was waging war on her fertility, the 27-year-old turned to IVF.

Four times doctors implanted embryos into Mrs Phasey's womb, and four times the procedure failed as her body killed off the 'foreign bodies'.

In the face of their infertility, it was
 a rare treatment involving egg yolks being injected into Mrs Phasey's 
body, to suppress the 'natural killer cells' in her system, that 
helped the couple realise their dream of becoming parents.

For eight years Lucy Phasey longed to fall pregnant, but doctors told her she would never conceive naturally because her immune system interpreted any embryos as a foreign body, killing them off. But in February the 27-year-old gave birth to Evie Ray, after four failed rounds of IVF

Mrs Phasey and her husband Liam, also 27, endured three failed rounds of IVF and one miscarriage and had almost given up hope of becoming parents when they heard about a rare treatment which could help. Their gorgeous daughter was born on February 7

The treatment involved Mrs Phasey being injected with egg yolk and soya bean oil to suppress the killer cells in Mrs Phasey's system that were attacking the embryos

Seven years after being told she 
might never become a mother, Mrs Phasey and her husband Liam, also 27, welcomed tiny Evie Ray into the world in February.

After enduring four failed IVF attempts - including one miscarriage - the couple were told they would have to opt for private care if they wanted more answers.

Baffled doctors were unable to diagnose the problem but Mr and Mrs Phasey could not stretch their finances to meet the cost, resigning themselves to never having their own children.

Distraught, Mrs Phasey told her husband to move on and find another wife who could give him the child he so desperately wanted.

A year later, the couple heard about a rare treatment, giving them a glimmer of hope.

The procedure involved Mrs Phasey having egg yolk and soya bean oil injected into her system through an IV drip.

And on February 7, the couple welcomed Evie Ray into the world at Wrexham Maelor Hospital.

'I have five nieces and nephews and I honestly thought I would never go through that myself,” said Mrs Phasey, from Dolgellau, North Wales.

Mr and Mrs Phasey were first told they would never conceive naturally in 2007, after being together for a year

Eighteen months later they started their rounds of IVF from October 2009 to April 2012, three failing and a fourth resulting in a miscarriage

The pair then stumbled across CARE, an infertility treatment centre in Manchester, where a doctor told them Mrs Phasey's immune system was too strong, killing off embryos because it thought they were a foreign body

The treatment is given to suppress natural killer (NK) cells in a woman's body, the theory being that some women’s bodies are non-baby-friendly and their immune system attacks the embryo as if it were a foreign body.

Intralipids — a mix of soya-bean oil, egg yolk, glycerine and water — are a fat emulsion used as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for post-operative patients and premature babies requiring nutrition into their bloodstream.

They have also been found to have an immuno-suppressant effect. The theory is that the intralipids have a stabilising effect on cell membranes, which makes it harder for the killer cells to attack and go on to cause implantation failure and miscarriage.

The fats are highly calorific — about 200 calories a dose, the equivalent of a Snickers bar — and have been likened to ‘getting an armful of mayonnaise’.

Administered via a drip usually twice before conception, and then three more times after, the treatment is thought to help the embryo implant and grow normally.

Alongside this, women are also recommended to take steroids, which further suppress the immune system, and blood thinners to prevent blood clots, which also can impede embryos implanting.

'It has just made our whole family, on both sides, complete. It is an amazing feeling, she is such a wanted baby.

'She’s 14 weeks old now and I’m still in a bubble, I have to keep pinching myself and think "is this really me, am I a mum?"

'I’m still calling myself Auntie to her by default because I still don’t believe she is my daughter, I have to remind myself I’m her mum.'

The first blow for the couple came in 2007, when after being together for a year and a half, they were told they would never be able to conceive a child naturally.

After 18 months of 'filling out forms' and having further tests, they started IVF treatment at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital.

They went through four attempts, between October 2009 and April 2012, on the NHS, but each failed, and despite scrimping and saving they were unable to afford any more.

The pair then stumbled across CARE, an infertility treatment centre in Manchester, where a doctor told them Mrs Phasey’s immune system was too strong, killing off embryos because it thought they were a foreign body.

The 27-year-old was given intravenous intralipid therapy, a treatment administered through an IV drip and made from soya bean oil, egg yolk, glycerin and water.

The therapy stimulates the immune system to suppress so-called 'natural killer cells' and allow an embryo to implant in the womb.

Mrs Phasey became pregnant just months later, and the couple welcomed Evie Ray in to the world on February 7. 'She's 14 weeks old now and I'm still in a bubble, I have to keep pinching myself and think is this really me, am I really a mum,' said Mrs Phasey

After just months, Mrs Phasey became pregnant when an embryo was implanted in her womb in April 2013.

'It was a very nerve-wracking morning for us and the family,' she said.

'We both held onto the hope that this would be the one. I could tell when they put it in there, I could see she was a fighter and would be the one, I just sort of knew.

'I did feel a bit weird knowing what was being put inside of me but after years of non-natural methods I was definitely on board with the more natural way.

'I just kept taking tests, we took the positive one at 5.05am before Liam went to work and we were just ecstatic, I woke all my family up to tell them!

'It was such a contrast to before, I had tried to tell Liam to go off and have a baby with someone else because I felt I couldn’t make him happy, and now we were looking at our own baby, after nine years.

'He didn’t believe he was going to be a daddy until she was placed in his arms really, he kept avoiding the subject until he knew she was real, it was an incredible moment.'

The couple have yet to decide if they will try for more children, but are enjoying the realisation of their eight-year dream with the birth of Evie Ray.

Mrs Phasey said: 'We wouldn’t want to experience the heartache again, but we have stored embryos for three years so perhaps it will be an option.

'But we’ll never be disappointed because Evie is here and we have what we wanted.'
