It covered cars in a fine layer of dust carried 1,500 miles from the Sahara desert and prevented David Cameron taking his early morning jog.

Now experts have revealed that the freak weather conditions, which left parts of the country under a smoggy haze earlier this month, also triggered a record surge in demand for hay fever treatments.

Pharmacists saw demand for products including antihistamine tablets, nose sprays and eye drops, increase by 84 per cent in the first week of April when compared to the same week in 2013.

Although warmer weather meant sales had already risen by 42 per cent and 49 per cent over the previous two weeks, they surged when the smog cloud was at its peak.

People with asthma, hay fever and breathing problems particularly suffered in the smoggy conditions, according to aeroallergen and agricultural air quality researcher at the University of Worcester, Dr Carsten Skjøth.

He said: ‘It's common to have the air pollution and pollen at this time of year but it's very unusual to have the cocktail with the dust as well.’

As a result, he believed many hay fever sufferers experienced more severe symptoms than usual – which will come as no surprise to millions of people who have been sneezing and sniffing as the hay fever season gets under way.

According to advice issued by the charity Allergy UK, the smog also coincided with the birch pollen season to provide the perfect storm for hay fever sufferers.

The charity said: ‘The weather patterns resulted in high pollution together with dust from the Sahara.

‘In addition, we’ve seen the start of the birch pollen season with high and very high counts in the South of England and the Midlands.

‘This combination may have an impact on those with asthma, hay fever and other respiratory problems.’ 

When the smog cloud hit Britain, the worst affected areas for pollution levels were in the capital and South East England, both given the maximum level of 10, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

These regions also saw the highest demand for hay fever treatments from ChemistDirect over the same period, with sales rising by 25 per cent in London, and 12 per cent in the South East of England.

Experts believe people with hay fever, asthma and other breathing problems suffered the most while the air quality was poor

The elevated pollution levels were the result of a combination of light south-easterly winds, continental air flow, a mix of traffic and power station emissions and dust which was blown up from the Sahara desert.

In effect this created a ‘lid’ on the air at ground level so pollens were released and were unable to escape into the upper atmosphere.

Instead, they were concentrated at lower levels where they cause the most problems for hay fever sufferers.

The Defra Daily Air Quality Index hit the top level of 10 on April 1 in parts of East Anglia and the South East.

This is calculated by measuring pollutants – ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and tiny particulate matter known as PM10 and PM 2.5.

Omar El-Gohary, ChemistDirect Superintendent Pharmacist, said many people with pre-existing health conditions such as asthma and hay fever found that their symptoms were aggravated by the recent weather conditions.

‘Hay fever sufferers usually need to pre-empt when their symptoms begin and start taking medication as early as possible, but this year many people were caught by surprise as they were affected earlier than usual,’ he said.

As well as managing symptoms through tablets and sprays for the eyes and nose, Mr El-Gohary also recommends sufferers take part in regular exercise and improve their diet with more fruit and vegetables.

But he warned sufferers to avoid apples, tomatoes and melons, and to reduce their alcohol intake, which can make symptoms worse.
