A woman living beside the house where eight children were stabbed to death has revealed she saw the mother and kids clearing out their home the day before the tragedy occurred.

A neighbour said she saw the mother and a number of children carrying a number of unwanted items out into the street, apparently getting rid of personal possessions.

She said the items included children's toys, which has left her and other neighbours wondering if something bad was already going through the mother's mind.

Neighbours in Cairns have been left distraught after eight kids were stabbed in a house on their street 

A sea of people have come to the floral tribute to pay their respects to the victims of the stabbing

'It would be terrible to think that she was getting the children to help her clear up, knowing that she was going to do something bad to them - if that was what happened,' said a Torres Strait islander neighbour. 

Mersane Warria, the mother of seven of the children killed inside the home, has been charged with murder following the horrific incident.

The 37-year-old was charged with eight counts of murder, and appeared before a magistrate in a bedside hearing at the Cairns Base Hospital this morning.

The woman was remanded in police custody, and currently remains in hospital.

When relatives were told the news that the mother had been arrested for the murder of seven of her children and her niece, three relatives put their heads in their hands and wailed.

'No, no, my babies, my babies.' 

They asked for the information to be repeated three times, unable to believe that the mother could be responsible. 

'No way, no way could this ever happen... How could she do this? How is this happening to my family?' 

A number of cousins who were sitting on park equipment where the children played everyday said the stabbing was 'unfair' and paid tribute to the happy children.

'This is their park, this is their place. They just wanted to have fun.' 

'This is so unfair. This is so wrong. No matter what life threw at them, those kids were so happy and bright.

'They were beautiful. All good mates.' 

The father of the youngest four children was not living with the family at the time. Relatives said he stayed there sometimes, but 'they were always breaking up and getting back together'.

'They fought a lot. But he saw the kids and then he left. He wasn't at the house yesterday,'

'Their dad was with them just yesterday. His babies... My babies...' 

Police have removed the bodies of the children from the house after they spent the night at the scene

They said the father of the children was not doing well, but said he was being looked after by friends and family.  

'He's not good. He's with family but he's not good.' 

The children were also with their cousin at the time of the accident. The child, a girl, often spent time with the family and lived nearby. 

'Her parents are with family and with the children's dad. They are not okay. We can't sleep, we can't do anything.' 

Family members have revealed that the mother wasn't religious and did not attend a church.

'The rest of the extended family was religious, but she wasn't. They wouldn't go to church every week or anything like that.'

'But the rest of the family is religious which will be a big help. Knowing that there's something else.' 

Neighbours Lucy and Lency Piva told Daily Mail Australia that the incident has come as a big shock to the community and will be a 'big lesson' for people living on the street.

'This is a big lesson for us to look out for our neighbours. You here a sound and you don't even look over,' the neighbours said. 

'We need to take care of each other and make sure that everybody is okay. People don't want to get involved but this is a big lesson. This is a big shock'.

Some Torres Strait Islander community members speculate that it could be months before a funeral, as per tradition, which requires a long period of mourning.

A plastic container has been put down in the community garden at the base of a tree. 

'Any contribution will help this family through this hard time. Thanks,' the note reads.

'Any money will got towards the funerals,' their relative explains.

'They don't have the money. It's a big stress.

'Any money left over will go to the police and emergency people. They need help as much as the family.'

He sits in silence for hours, staring at the tributes.

Eight children have been found dead and a 37-year-old woman is in hospital with chest injuries at a home in North Queensland.

Mersane Warria's cousin, Torres Strait Regional mayor Fred Gala, told The Australian Warria left the Torres Strait ten years ago and was from a 'well-respected family'.

Mr Gala said the tragedy is 'immensely distressing' for the family.    

Another neighbour told The Australian that she heard loud noises and screaming coming from across the road, but didn't think to call the police, as neighbours on the street are always screaming at each other. 

'I heard a lady screaming and carrying on for 20 minutes or so,' she said. 

'She was getting angry at someone and screaming at a person; I heard swearing, 

 A mother told yesterday of her relief that her 12-year-old daughter was 'just by chance' not at the house  in the 'backpacker Mecca' city of Cairns.

The mother, who identified herself only as Sophie to protect the identity of her child, said her daughter was a friend of several of the children who died because they all attended the nearby high school. 

The local community has been left devastated by yesterdays tragedy, with many mourners paying their respects at a floral memorial

'They're always mucking about in each other's houses and I'm just relieved that this was a day when my daughter wasn't here,' said Sophie as she stood some 30m from the house of death in the dark at the end of another day that has sent shock waves not only around Australia but the world.

Throughout the day complete strangers had walked along leafy Murray Street, in the suburb of Manoora, to place flowers as close to the home as possible - police had blocked direct access to the street near the fibre-cement house where the Torres Strait islander family lived. 

'We're all trying to work out what happened,' said one of her friends who had supported Sophie as the shock had hit her that her daughter - or one of her daughter's close friends - could have been at the house where a generation of children had been wiped out.

Even in the darkness of the poorly-lit street people continued to arrive as close as they were allowed to stare at the house, the front of which had been shielded off with tarpaulin by police, who were continuing to work through the night under arc lights. 

The brutal deaths of the children aged from 18 months to 14 years has raised many questions, the main one the lips of everyone in the street tonight being: 'Why?' 

 'There's no doubt that if she did this she obviously just 'lost it',' said one neighbour.
