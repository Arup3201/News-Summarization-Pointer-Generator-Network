The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were known to navigate the sewers of New York on skateboards.

And now a real-life tortoise is following in their footsteps.

Shannon Apple from Maryland filmed her pet reptile taking a spin on a miniature board.

The animal is certainly kitted out for his new sporting pursuit. 

Armed with a shell in the event of a crash, the reptile is seen confidently wheeling along.

To date the video of the skateboarding tortoise has been watched hundreds of  times.

Many viewers have applauded the animal's skill. 

'Wow he can really move on the skateboard. I love this!' one commentator wrote.

Another added: 'Hah! That's so great. It's like the perfect size for him!'

Shannon Apple said she originally purchased the board for her pet squirrel Wally. 

However, he didn't warm to the concept as much as his turtle friend.
