A mother has credited her baby daughter with saving her life after doctors discovered a deadly heart condition when she went into hospital to give birth.

Samantha McRoberts, 29, arrived at hospital for a scheduled Caesarean delivery of her third child, Marley.

But she struggled to stay conscious in the aftermath of the delivery and emergency tests confirmed she had a seriously weakened heart valve which could have failed at any time.

Samantha McRoberts believes baby Marley saved her life because she discovered after the birth that she had a potentially deadly heart condition that needed immediate teratment

When she was pregnant with Marley, Miss McRoberts was very breathless and ill but she was told it was normal

She said: ‘If I hadn’t been in hospital at that time, and under those circumstances, then my heart condition might never have been discovered.

‘I thank Marley for saving my life - if it wasn’t for her, I don’t know if I would be here today.’

Miss McRoberts, a supermarket worker from Bracknell, discovered she was pregnant with Marley in the summer of 2012.

She said: ‘My partner Chris and I were delighted when we found out. We couldn’t wait to have another child together.

‘I suffered with very bad sickness from an early stage of the pregnancy. I spent entire days in the bathroom, near the toilet.

‘But more worrying than that was the fact I was also quite out of breath, so I decided to ask my doctor about it.’

Marley was delivered by C-section but after the delivery Miss McRoberts started drifting in and out of consciousness. Her heart then stopped numerous times and a crash team had to battle to save her life

Concerned, Miss McRoberts visited her GP who reassured her that her breathlessness and sickness were the results of an infection and the fact she was asthmatic.

She said: ‘It was a struggle but the C-section was booked for the following February, so I had something to focus on. I battled through my discomfort.’

Miss McRoberts had a severely damaged mitral valve.

This valve separates the upper left heart chamber from the lower left heart chamber and helps control blood flow through the heart.

Problems with the valve can make the heart less efficient at pumping blood around the body.

Severe problems with the valve can lead to heart failure.

To prevent this, surgery is required to replace or repair the valve.

This operation usually involves cutting down the middle of the breastbone to access the heart.

Surgeons can then repair the valve or replace it with one made from animal tissue.

But there were troubling signs from the 
moment Miss McRoberts was given a spinal block after arriving at 
hospital for the delivery.

She said: ‘As the anaesthetic began to work I felt deathly ill. My memory is patchy, but I have a clear image of Chris standing over me, urging me to keep calm.

'My heart rate was fluctuating but the doctors and midwives managed to stabilise me.’

She was able to enjoy a moment of happiness as Marley was placed on her chest following the delivery, but the calm was abruptly shattered when her vital signs suddenly crashed.

She said: ‘The doctors rushed around me and I was aware of voices asking me to stay awake as I dipped in and out of consciousness.’

Waking up three hours later, doctors gave a shocking assessment - her heart had stopped several times and at some points she had been just seconds from death. It was only the quick thinking of the crash team which had saved her life.

A detailed scan revealed one of her heart valves had been practically destroyed. A bout of rheumatic fever she suffered as a child was identified as the probable cause.

It was thought that the strain of the pregnancy with her daughter had been too much for her heart.

She said: ‘I already had a son, Harvey, who’s now four, with Chris, and I had a daughter Summer, now eight, from a previous relationship, so it was a mystery why I hadn’t suffered through those previous pregnancies.

‘The only certainty was that I was lucky I was in hospital when it happened - if it hadn’t have been for Marley, I would have died.’

Tests revealed Miss McRoberts had a severely damaged heart valve which could fail at any time

Shaken, Miss McRoberts was confronted with the news that she needed open heart surgery to repair her damaged valve.

She said: ‘The thought of leaving my children without a mother was enough to motivate me. Although the heart surgery would be risky, I needed to make sure I would be around for them in the future, and surgery was the only way.’

Thankfully, the operation to replace the valve in July 2013 was a success and she was able to return home to her family.

She said: ‘For the first few months of Marley’s life I was ordered to have lots of bed rest. I was so weak I couldn’t even pick her up, so there were moments when I wondered whether it would affect me bonding with her.

‘Chris was absolutely amazing, and took over all the duties for night feeds and changing nappies.’

Marley turned one last month and Miss McRoberts is now fully recovered from surgery.

She said: ‘I needn’t have worried about not bonding with her - we’re as close as we could be. I feel so proud of my whole family for coping with what I’ve been through.

‘I’m particularly proud of Marley, because without her I wouldn’t be here.’
