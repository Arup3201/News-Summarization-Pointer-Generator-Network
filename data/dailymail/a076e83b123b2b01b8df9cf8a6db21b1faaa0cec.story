Just before the lights threatened to go out on Liverpool’s season, the players’ phones lit up with news on social media that Mario Balotelli had made his way to the Echo Arena.

The Liverpool forward, casually dressed in three-quarter length jeans and camouflage loafers, had taken a front-row seat to watch Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly slug it out over 12 rounds.

At that point, a few Liverpool players at their team hotel in London wanted to get the Italian in the ring.

Ostensibly, Balotelli had permission to do whatever he wanted because a hamstring injury ruled him out of the 450-mile round trip for Sunday’s 3-1 defeat at Crystal Palace.

But, after four defeats in a row for Brendan Rodgers and his team, the done thing is to keep your head down.

The publicity did not go down well at breakfast the following morning, but nobody within the Liverpool camp was particularly surprised by Balotelli’s appearance. It was a new low.

Since Balotelli’s arrival at Anfield his attitude, particularly towards some of the younger players at the squad, has created tension within the dressing room.

During a series of television interviews given by the Italian before the Palace game, he claimed he was working harder than at any other time in his career.

It was a remarkable declaration for a player who has not scored a goal in the Premier League since netting at Wigan on November 28, 2012, when he was still a Manchester City player.

On the pitch, his movement — with the exception of his debut against Tottenham and his goal in the Champions League against Ludogorets — has been non-existent. He is vacuous.

The spirit at Liverpool, built up last season during their dramatic chase for the Premier League title, has been eroded by the forward’s presence on the training ground.

There are further issues within the Liverpool dressing room too, something Rodgers alluded to in his analysis of his team’s wretched defeat at Palace.

Liverpool’s manager admitted they are ‘low on confidence’, but went on to say that they ‘had been a close group . . . but had to make changes’.

Those refinements have not suited a team that finished within a whisker of beating Manchester City to the title last season.

On Sunday, as Steven Gerrard waited to lead his team out at Selhurst Park, he stood with his chin resting in the palm of his hand. He looked as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders.

Liverpool’s captain has been troubled since he was left out of the team to face Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on November 4.

4 - Liverpool are just four points above the drop zone

20th - Liverpool are far closer to the bottom of the league (six points off) than they are the top (18 points off)

1.3 - Goals per game let in by Rodgers’ side, the worst rate of any Liverpool boss in nearly 50 years.

10 - Rodgers’ side have 10 fewer points than they did at this stage last season

6 - Liverpool have lost six and won four league games this season. In the equivalent set of fixtures last season they won six and lost three

38% - Liverpool have kept clean sheets in 38 per cent of Rodgers’ games

Four core players — Gerrard, Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson — had slogged their guts out last season for the right to start in games like that.

They had travelled to Spain, returned to Liverpool midway through the night and then faced Chelsea in the lunchtime kick-off at Anfield the following Saturday. They lost 2-1.

Now that the team are five points off a place in the Champions League and are battling to stay in the competition this week, there are no guarantees any of them will return to the Bernabeu any time soon.

They have lost four successive games and Gerrard, who usually fronts up whatever the manner of a defeat, could not get on the team bus quick enough after Sunday’s loss.

Sterling, meanwhile, is in desperate need of a rest. In addition, his contract remains unsigned.

Alberto Moreno looked lost when he wandered out of the wrong exit at Selhurst Park and little wonder after an orthodox right-back — Glen Johnson — was preferred to him at left-back.

Rickie Lambert, who scored his first Premier League goal since joining his boyhood club, told Sky Sports that the attitude of the players had not been good enough.

The defeat at Palace has caused Fenway Sports Group to take an even greater interest in the running of the team after Rodgers admitted he is fighting to save his job.

The club’s owners are known to keep tabs on every newspaper, television programme and blog as they gauge supporter opinion in an environment they openly admit to knowing very little about.

Liverpool haven't been able to reproduce the brilliant form from their 2013-14 Premier League campaign 

John W Henry, Liverpool chairman Tom Werner and the influential director Michael Gordon are a ruthless bunch and are easily swayed by supporter feeling.

Roy Hodgson, Damien Comolli and Kenny Dalglish, recently appointed as a club ambassador, still bear the scars of their brutal approach to the business of running a football team.

Stateside, observers are looking at the £200million investment in the team and question the failure to re-establish Liverpool among the elite of English and European football.

They are aware of the tension brewing between the club’s director of technical performance Michael Edwards and Rodgers over Liverpool’s transfer policy.

After making it to the group phase of the Champions League, Fenway did not spend £200m to hear that their famous team is in transition.
