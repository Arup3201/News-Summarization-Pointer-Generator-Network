A woman who ballooned to 21st was shamed into losing nearly 9st - after she became too fat to go kayaking.

Sam Standerwick, 41, from Tredegar, south Wales, enjoyed watersports as a child but drifted into bad habits, sometimes eating whole chickens in one sitting or an entire multi-pack of crisps.

But when the project manager decided to take up kayaking again for her 40th birthday she discovered she was too big to easily slip into a wetsuit.

She embarked on a new active lifestyle and has dropped from 21st 9lbs to 13st 1lbs.

'I bought all the gear to kayak and paddle board but quickly realised I was spending more time preparing for it than actually being out on the water,' she said.

'I was always too tired by the time I got in the water. And of course a part of me always worried I would get stuck in the wetsuit!'

Sam, who lives with her husband Gareth and their three cats, said while she had always eaten relatively healthily, her downfall was large portions.

'I didn't go from eating pizza and chips to broccoli and chicken overnight, the difference is beforehand I might have eaten the whole chicken.

'It was the amount I was eating. I grew up in a healthy family so I ate meat, vegetables, pasta and things like that - but just huge portions.'

After taking up running the weight began to fall off, and Sam, who has no children, is now training for her 27th park race.

She used to squeeze into size 28 clothes but has now dropped to size 14 and completed two half-marathons, three 10k races and 26 5k races.

But unlike other dieters, the super slimmer said maintaining a healthy appetite and diet was what worked for her.

Eating 2,000 calories a day, she runs, cross trains and does weight lifting on a regular basis.

'It's not about fad diets or 1,200 calories a day,' she said.

'I'm never hungry, if I was then I couldn't do it. I think a lot of people do it, they crash diet and fail.

'It's easier than people make out. For me I've not found it impossibly difficult because I've not deprived myself of anything.'

Breakfast - Usually skipped or a bacon sandwich

Lunch: Sandwich, crisps and a chocolate bar

Dinner: A huge portion of meat, potatoes and veg

Snacks: Crisps, chocolate and biscuits throughout the day

Breakfast: Granola bar and protein shake (usually following an early gym session)

Lunch: Huge green salad with low-fat cottage cheese and a small portion of prawns

Dinner: Fish or chicken with lots of steamed or roasted veg

Snacks: The occasional chocolate bar

In just 14 months Sam has completed an incredible physical transformation and lifestyle overhaul
