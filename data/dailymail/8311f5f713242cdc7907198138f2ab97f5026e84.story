A Taliban leader has admitted the insurgents cannot win the war in Afghanistan.

The senior commander said it would take ‘divine intervention’ for the hardline group to recapture Kabul.

But he said Taliban chiefs could not admit this weakness because it would harm the morale of their fighters - raising the prospect that more British blood will be shed on the battlefield before combat troops withdraw in 2014.

In an extraordinary interview with the New Statesman, the veteran also launches a withering attack on al-Qaeda, branding the jihadists a ‘plague’.

‘At least 70 per cent of the Taliban are angry at al-Qaeda,’ said the former Guantánamo Bay inmate. ‘Our people consider al-Qaeda to be a plague that was sent down to us by the heavens.

‘To tell the truth, I was relieved at the death of Osama [bin Laden].

Through his policies, he destroyed Afghanistan. If he really believed in jihad he should have gone to Saudi Arabia and done jihad there, rather than wrecking our country.’

The Taliban commander - identified only as Mawlvi in the interview - was speaking to Michael Semple, a former UN envoy to Kabul who had maintained strong contacts with the radical group.

Despite the insurgents pumping out triumphalist rhetoric about their successes against coalition forces, Mawlvi said the only way forward for the group is to come to a political agreement with opponents.

He said: ‘The Taliban capturing Kabul is a very distant prospect.

‘Any Taliban leader expecting to be able to capture Kabul is making a grave mistake.

‘Nevertheless, the leadership also knows that it cannot afford to acknowledge this weakness.

‘To do so would undermine the morale of Taliban personnel. The leadership knows the truth – that they cannot prevail over the power they confront.

‘It would take some kind of divine intervention for the Taliban to win this war.’

The Taliban, he said, had shelved its vision of re-establishing the Islamic emirate it set up when in power from 1996 to 2001.

This regime banned women from education, carried out thousands of executions as rough justice and outlawed eating lobster, even though Afghanistan has no coastline.

‘Any side involved in a conflict like
this has decided to fight for power,’ he said. ‘If they fall short of 
national power, they have to settle for functioning as an organised 
party within the country.’

Mr
Semple said speaking unofficially allowed Mawlvi to stray from the 
Taliban’s ‘party line’ and reflect the views of its pragmatic wing.

This, he said, was a sign that the group wanted to re-open talks with the U.S.

However, only a few days ago video footage was released depicting the unwavering brutality of the Taliban, executing a woman for adultery. She was machinegunned in cold blood because two commanders could not decide who should ‘own’ her.

Mawlvi’s suggestion that the Taliban could be open to dialogue was welcomed by Western politicians with former Foreign Secretary David Miliband calling the commander’s comments a ‘landmark’ moment.

‘The candour and clarity of the remarks about al-Qaeda, Nato and the Afghan government show we are dealing with a sophisticated and long-term presence,’ he said.
