A heartbroken father hanged himself 18 months after his 'bullied' son committed suicide by jumping off a six-storey building, an inquest heard.

Roger Crouch killed himself after leaving a final farewell 
message to friends and family on Facebook.

The 55-year-old wrote on the social networking website 'Au Revoir, so 
long - or maybe A Bientot' before taking his own life in the garage of 
his home, the inquest in Gloucester was told.

Double family tragedy: Roger Crouch, left, died 18 months after his son Dominic threw himself from a six-storey building

Mr Crouch was overcome with grief at the suicide of his 15-year-old son 
Dominic 18 months earlier.

The former director of children's services for Gloucestershire County 
Council was also struggling to come to terms with the deaths of his 
sister from cancer, his nephew, and that of his mother when he was a 
child.

Following Dominic's death in May 2010 Mr Crouch had taken an overdose of
tablets and was then stopped from making another attempt as he drove 
his son's ashes to the Lake District to scatter them.

After psychiatric treatment following those two incidents Mr Crouch 
begun his award-winning campaign to highlight the problems of homophobic
bullying of children.

He launched the campaign following the death of Dominic, who had jumped 
from a six-storey building near his school amid rumours he was gay after
he apparently kissed a boy for a dare.

He was named as a 'hero of the year' by Stonewall, the lesbian, gay and bisexual charity, for his work.

Campaigner: Mr Crouch, pictured with Dominic in happier times

The anti-bullying campaigner took up the cause after it emerged at his 
son's inquest that rumours had started before his death in May 2010 that
Dominic might be gay.

The gossip followed a school trip to the Forest of Dean where the Year 
10 pupils had been playing spin the bottle and it was said Dominic 
kissed a boy.

Despite this, Dominic's inquest also heard the 'carefree' rugby-loving 
schoolboy had appeared happy after returning from the trip and never 
complained about bullying at the school.

The hearing heard that Mr Crouch's body was found in the garage of 
his home in Gretton, near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, by his wife Paola
on the night of November 28 last year.

Mrs Crouch, 52, alerted neighbours, who had cut down her husband, and 
they attempted to resuscitate him but paramedics declared him dead at 
8.45pm.

She said in a statement read to the court that her husband had continued
to suffer mood swings and bouts of depression over Dominic's death.

'There was a lot of death in his life,' she said.

On hearing evidence from psychiatrists that her husband had been 
'overcome by grief', Mrs Crouch added: 'I think it's what you might call
in an old fashioned way, a broken heart.'

A post mortem examination found that Mr Crouch, who was the town clerk 
for Stow-on-the-Wold, had enough alcohol in his body to be nearly twice 
the drink drive limit. Tests did not find any trace of drugs.

The cause of death was given as aspiration of gastric contents due to hanging.

Grief: Dominic's mother Paola with her son. She has paid tribute to her husband on Facebook

David Dooley, deputy coroner for Gloucestershire, recorded a verdict of suicide.

He said: 'Clearly he was very taken up with campaigning for his son and others he felt may have been subjected to bullying.

'But he was eventually overwhelmed by grief for his son.

'On the evidence I feel I can be sure of his settled intent to take his own life.

'Therefore the appropriate verdict for me to give is that Roger Crouch took his own life.'

Before closing the inquest, Mr Dooley also offered his condolences to Mrs Crouch.

She declined to speak after leaving the hearing.

After Mr Crouch's death his wife paid tribute to him on Facebook, saying: 'I have the saddest news to give you.

'The love of my life and Giulia and Domi's beloved dad has died.

'The changes you have started, for 
young people everywhere, the work you have done against bullying will 
remain as a towering monument to you.

'Our hearts break Roger, Domi, Giulia and I loved you so much.'

On the social networking site's page 
Friends of Dom Crouch Against Bullying, Mrs Crouch has added photos of 
her husband that showed him in 'happy times'.

She added: 'You were such fun to be with, my gorgeous man.'
