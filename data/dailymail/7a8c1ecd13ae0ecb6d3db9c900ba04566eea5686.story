An England cricketer allegedly used a dating app to try and lure a young woman to his hotel room just hours after losing to Australia in a humiliating Ashes defeat.

Monty Panesar invited a blonde backpacker to his room after exchanging messages with the girl in her twenties on Tinder, it has been reported.

The 31-year-old is thought to have asked the American, known only as Alison, to come over for a drink as he wasn't allowed to go out under coaches' orders.

England cricketer Monty Panesar allegedly invited the girl to his hotel room as he was not allowed to go out

The girl, who wishes to withhold her second name, spotted Panesar on the app which allows users to view singletons within a 50 mile radius, after he uploaded a picture of himself batting against Australia.

She claims to have recognised the spin bowler after attending the match the previous day.

'I thought it was a bit strange that he would be behaving like that so soon after they had lost,' she told the Sunday Mirror.

'I wanted to talk to him about cricket but he had no intentions of 
that. All he seemed interested in was getting me over to the hotel.'

'I would have met him in a public place 
but I was not going to meet him at his apartment by myself.'

The divorcee reportedly told Alison that he loved American girls before inviting her to the four star Como hotel.

The spin bowler was dropped from the team following the defeat but reportedly invited the girl to his hotel room hours after the match

The Sikh cricketer allegedly abandoned his teetotal lifestyle following his divorce from wife, Gursharan Rattan.

A court ordered him to stay away from his former wife in 2011 following an alleged incident outside a pub.

Last summer he was arrested and fined for urinating on bouncers in a nightclub in Brighton.

Panesar has been dropped from the England line up following his poor performance against Australia.
