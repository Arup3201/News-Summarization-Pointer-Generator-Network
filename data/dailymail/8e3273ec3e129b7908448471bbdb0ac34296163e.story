Jennifer Simpson had been meeting with the client for two years before the blackmail began

A 15-stone prostitute who worked under the name ‘Curvy Candy’ has been jailed after she blackmailed a client by threatening to tell his wife about their illicit meetings.

Jennifer Simpson, 31, also made a false rape claim against the married father, who she had been meeting for two years, after he refused to pay her £500.

The mother-of-two appeared at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday and was jailed for two years and eight months after admitting blackmail.

The court heard how Simpson sent the client a text while he was on a family holiday abroad in January 2013, demanding he give her £500 by the end of the day.

She contacted him again on May 1 and threatened to come to his house and tell his wife and business customers about their relationship if he refused to give her the money.

The victim was so scared his wife and daughters would find out about his secret trysts that he agreed to pay Simpson £400.

But, on May 26, she phoned the man's home landline at 6am and said she had a £1,200 drugs debt and was being threatened.

He hung up but admitted what was going on to his wife when she became suspicious and confronted him about the call.

The next time Simpson rang, the man’s wife answered and told her to leave her husband alone.

But undeterred, she sent several texts to the victim accusing him of raping her and stealing her cash.

Police arrested Simpson the next day and she pleaded guilty to blackmail on a basis she believed she was owed money but accepted her demands were unwarranted and inappropriate.

Recorder Tracey Lloyd-Nesling told her: 'Blackmail is a very serious offence.

'It is aggravated by your persistence. In particular, you tried to make a false claim of rape.'

Prosecutor Steven Bailey told the court the victim met Simpson through an escort service and frequently met up with her for oral sex but had not seen her since 2012.

Stuart Muldoon, defending, said Simpson acted 'out of desperation'.

He told the court she started working in the sex industry after losing contact with her children.

A neighbour of Simpson said: 'I had no idea she was a prostitute. She kept herself to herself.

'You couldn’t really miss her though because she was a big girl. She must have been at least 15 stone but that obviously didn’t put her punters off.'
