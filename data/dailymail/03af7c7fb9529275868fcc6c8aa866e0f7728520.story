In jail: San Francisco 49ers linebacker Aldon Smith was arrested on Friday in San Jose on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana possession

San Francisco 49ers linebacker Aldon Smith was arrested Friday morning in San Jose, California, on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana possession, authorities said.

Smith, 23, was arrested by officers who received a call about a solo vehicle crash involving a pickup truck at around 7am, San Jose police Sgt. Heather Randol said.

Officers proceeded to take a breathalyser test and other tests.

They conducted an investigation and determined he was under the influence,’ Randol said.

The team released a statement regarding the All Pro linebacker Friday morning.

‘The 49ers organisation is aware of the matter involving Aldon Smith. As we continue to gather information regarding this situation, we will have no further comment,’ the team said.

Smith was booked into the Santa Clara County jail on $5,250 bail where he remained in custody late Friday morning.

It is not clear whether Smith will play Sunday for the Niners when they host the Indianapolis Colts at Candlestick Park.

The linebacker was also arrested on suspicion of drunken driving in Miami Beach in January 2012.

Smith has also been named in a lawsuit by a Northern California man who said he was shot during a party at Smith's house.

Lost control: Aldon Smith crashed his pickup truck at 7am Friday morning in San Jose, California

Another case: Aldon Smith is also facing a lawsuit from Ronndale Esporlas, 21, who claims he was shot at one of Smith's house parties last year

Locked up: Aldon Smith is being held at Santa Clara County jail on $5,250 bail

In the suit filed earlier this month 
in Santa Clara County Superior Court, David Kleczek, an attorney for 
Ronndale Esporlas, claims that Smith and former Niners tight end Delanie
Walker fired weapons illegally during a party at Smith's San Jose home 
on June 29, 2012.

The players charged a $10 admission and $5 per drink, the lawsuit said.

Smith
and Walker, who is also named in the suit, were allegedly intoxicated 
on Smith's balcony when they later fired gunshots in the air while 
trying to end the party, the lawsuit said.

Kleczek
said they then moved to the driveway where he alleged more shots were 
fired. Esporlas, 21, was shot twice in the leg while he was ‘caught in 
the crossfire between the two groups of people firing gunshots at each 
other,’ the lawsuit said.

Sidekick: Delanie Walker of the San Francisco 49ers is also named in the lawsuit for allegedly firing gunshots in the air while trying to end a house party

Victim: Ronndale Esporlas, 21, 'sustained serious, catastrophic and permanent injuries' from being shot at the party hosted by Smith and Walker

As a result, Esporlas, ‘sustained serious, catastrophic and permanent injuries,’ the lawsuit said. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.

Attorneys for Smith and Walker, 29, have said Esporlas "freely and voluntarily exposed himself to all risks of harm" by attending the party.

They say injuries suffered by Esporlas, who was shot in the leg, were not caused by the defendants.Santa Clara County prosecutors have said they are considering criminal charges.

The NFL is no stranger to controversy when it comes to its players.

Since
the Super Bowl on February 3, there have been at least 37 incidents of 
NFL players being arrested or charged with crimes, including 10 players 
accused of driving drunk, according to USA Today.

A week later, Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Josh Brent (left) allegedly drove drunk and flipped his car, killing teammate Jerry Brown in the passenger seat

Aaron Hernandez, former player for the NFL's New England Patriots football team, was recently indicted for the killing of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd in June

accused of driving drunk, according to USA Today.

The most recent is the murder indictment for ex-New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez.

But
the list gets uglier if the second half of last season is included 
which saw three car crashes and three people dead in crimes allegedly 
committed by NFL players.

On
December 1, Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher fatally shot 
himself in the head after getting drunk and killing his girlfriend.

drunk and flipped his car, killing teammate Jerry Brown in the passenger
