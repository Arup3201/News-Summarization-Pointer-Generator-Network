A former professional boxer has been arrested for allegedly murdering his manager in 1987 after a DNA breakthrough allegedly tied him to the crime scene.

Exum Speight, 50, was arrested at his home in San Fernando, California on Tuesday in connection with the death of Douglas Stumler, who was found stabbed and strangled at his home 26 years ago.

Stumler, 30, worked for the county Housing Authority and had been managing Speight for two years as a side job when he was found dead in his West Los Angeles apartment.

A concerned friend discovered his body two days after his death amid signs of a lengthy and violent struggle at the apartment, LAPD Detective Rick Jackson told the Los Angeles Times.

Speight had been a suspect early on in the case because he had argued with Stumler over some stolen property. The two men had lived together at one point during the mid-1980s, police said.

But Speight was never charged in the death and he continued his boxing career until 2001. He retired having lost 39 of his 50 professional fights.

Most famously, Speight was defeated by current heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko in a technical knockout in Austria on November 30, 1996. It was Klitschko's second professional fight.

But in 2010, the LA Police Department sent DNA to the Cold Case DNA Program at the National Institute of Justice which found DNA on Stumler's body matched Speight, authorities said.

Police began collecting witness statements and eventually prosecutors drew up a warrant for his arrest. He was taken into custody by an LAPD-FBI fugitive task force a day later.

Stumler was born in Indiana and moved to Los Angeles after graduating from the University of Indiana about six years before his death.

He had spent March 29, 1987 with a friend and returned to his apartment alone, but when the friend called him that night, he did not respond, Jackson told the LA Times.

He also failed to meet with friends at a Hoosiers NCAA basketball game and, when he didn't turn up for work that week, friends decided to check on him.

A friend went to the apartment block and, with a building manager, discovered the body inside. Police found his body was covered with stab wounds and signs of strangulation.

'It was not a quick thing,' Jackson said.

Speight is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday at the Airport Branch Courthouse. He is being held on $1 million bond.

Speight recently worked as a security 
guard at a Venice Beach marijuana clinic. Photographs on his Facebook page show numerous images of the plant.
