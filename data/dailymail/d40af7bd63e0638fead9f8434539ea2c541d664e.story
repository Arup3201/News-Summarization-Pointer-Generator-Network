A wave of migrants 4,500 years ago left their trace in the DNA and languages of modern Europeans.

This is according to a study that found evidence of this Stone Age migration by analysing DNA of 69 people who lived across Europe between 8,000 and 3,000 years ago.

Among the shifts in the genetic make-up of ancient Europeans they found that DNA associated with the Yamnaya people appeared strongly in what is now northern Germany.

Researchers have identified a mass migration of Kurgan populations (Yamna culture) which went from the Russian steppes to the centre of Europe 4,500 years ago. Previously, researchers had believed it spread 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East, now modern day Turkey, brought it to Europe

There are two main theories as to how Indo-European languages spread in Europe. 

The first is the Anatolian hypothesis, which claims spread of the language occurred some 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East (currently Turkey) brought it to Europe.

The Kurgan hypothesis, meanwhile, proposes that the language was spread by nomadic herders of the steppes found to the north of the Black and Caspian Sea.

This theory suggests their language spread throughout Europe after the invention of wheeled vehicles, from 6,000 to 5,000 years ago.

The Yamnaya were herders who lived in the steppe north of the Black and Aral Seas.

This injection of DNA indicates 'a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery,' said the researchers, led by David Reich of Harvard Medical School.

Such a large-scale influx would likely have affected not just the DNA but ancient cultures as well.

Although genes can't determine what people spoke, the researchers argue that their findings could influence the debate about the origins of Indo-European tongues.

Indo-European languages include more than 400 tongues, from modern languages such as English and Polish to ancient languages like Hittite and Sanskrit.

Basque, which is spoken in south-west France and northern Spain, is not Indo-European, and may be the only surviving relic of earlier languages once spoken more widely, according to the BBC. 

Linguists have long debated whether Indo-European languages came to Europe with farmers migrating from the Middle East or some other group, such as the Yamnaya.

Previously, researchers had believed that Indo-European language spread some 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East, now modern day Turkey, brought it to Europe.

The latest study suggests that Europe was first reshaped at this time in what archaeologists call the Neolithic Revolution.

Farmers from Anatolia travelled north, bringing new technology and language into Europe. This was followed by a second wave of people several thousand years later from what is today Ukraine and Russia.

The latest study suggests that Europe was first reshaped during the Neolithic Revolution 8,500 years ago. Farmers at this time travelled north, bringing new technology and language into Europe. Pictured is an early Neolithic 35-40 year old male from, Czech Republic, who was part of the first mass migration to Europe

As well as genetic evidence, researchers point to the fact that many Indo-European languages share words for things like axles, harness poles, and the wheel.

These devices were invented long after the Neolithic Revolution began in Europe.

'Major language replacements are thought to require large-scale migration,' said the authors of the study, which was published Monday by the journal Nature.

'Our results make a compelling case for the steppe as a source of at least some of the Indo-European languages in Europe.'

Andrew Garrett, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the study, said it was significant that the mass migration occurred at a time some models had previously identified for Indo-European expansion.

'It fills in a significant piece of a big and interesting puzzle,' said Garrett.
