Gary Neville is presenting his own video technology-inspired Monday Night Football specials for the England team ahead of the World Cup, defender Phil Jagielka has revealed.

Neville, one of Roy Hodgson's coaches, has been using his hugely successful video analysis routines from Sky Sports to teach players the ins and outs of group opponents Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica.

Jagielka told the Daily Telegraph:
 'The teams we're playing against, we know a few of the strikers already
 because they play in the Premier League or some of the big clubs around
 Europe, so you've an idea of what you're up against.

All for show: Gary Neville has been using his video analysis on the England side

'But there's so much video you can get hold of. We've got three video analysis people here.

'Obviously, Gary Neville's more than capable of taking you through a video or two.

'It's pretty much like watching Monday Night Football, with more of a personal touch, and he can't tell you off.'

England
 kick off their campaign against Italy on June 14 in Manaus, but the 
Italians have no British-based players in their squad.

Despite this, Jagielka is fully aware of star man Mario Balotelli's ability after his time with Manchester City.

'We've
 played against Balotelli. He's a character. He scores goals. He's got 
fantastic ability and a fantastic shot on him, especially with the way 
these balls move.'
