Fans: Lovers of Beyoncé were sold fake tickets by a tout as part of a widespread online scam

Hundreds of Beyoncé fans were left disappointed after discovered they had been sold fake tickets to the star's concerts as part of a scam worth at least £28,000.

The online fraud saw music lovers turned away from Beyoncé's shows in Manchester this week after they were told that the tickets they had bought online were in fact forgeries.

Police have now issued an appeal for victims - who apparently paid around £100 per ticket - to come forward in a bid to discover who was behind the lucrative scam.

A number of the fraud victims said they bought tickets to see the star perform at the Phones4U Arena after seeing them advertised on classified listings website Gumtree.

They picked up the tickets in person, but when they arrived at the venue for the concerts on Tuesday and Wednesday they were denied entrance by staff.

Michael Hegarty agreed to pay £220 for a pair of Beyoncé tickets from a 'very plausible' tout after the man, whom he had met on Gumtree, sold him a genuine ticket to a Manchester United match.

When he realised he was unable to attend the concert, he sold the tickets on to someone else - but the order number turned out to have been forged and the barcode did not work.

Another victim told the Manchester Evening News she also bought her tickets via Gumtree, from a man who claimed to work from a London-based concierge service.

'They looked really real and he seemed so genuine,' the unnamed woman said. 'It's horrible. I don't know how anybody could do that to someone.'

Other fans used Twitter to buy the fake tickets, only to be turned away once they arrived at the venue.

'A work colleague and myself found the "tickets" last week through Twitter,' Anna Boulton, from Manchester, told MailOnline. 'We contacted the seller through Twitter and payed through PayPal.

'We received the email with scanned in versions of e-tickets, which made me a little uneasy. However we were too excited to do anything about that.

'As soon as we handed the ticket over at the box office, the woman simply said, "You've bought fake tickets. We've had probably about a hundred of this ticket bought here tonight not working with exactly the same name on it."

'Luckily as we payed through PayPal and our seller seems very nice, we are in the process of receiving a refund.

'I thought I was a lot more streetwise than to be scammed like this - but by the sounds of it, so were a lot of people.'

Fake: This is one of the forged tickets which was turned away at the Phone4U Arena in Manchester

Arena workers said that they had rejected at least 140 tickets at the entrance gates, according to British Transport Police, but just seven victims have reported the fraud to police.

'It seems that someone has been selling fake tickets to concert goers who only realise the tickets aren't genuine when they get to the venue,' Detective Constable Mike Dermody said.

'We believe there have been more than 140 sets of fake tickets sold, though only seven victims have come forward so far.

'In most cases the tickets have sold for at least £100 each and each victim has bought at least two tickets, so we are potentially looking at a fraud worth more than £28,000.

'Each transaction has taken place over the internet, using public selling websites, with the victims arranging to meet someone in Manchester to pick up the tickets.

'I believe the victims of this fraudster will be spread far and wide as people travel from all over the UK to see Beyoncé.

'I am, therefore, appealing to anyone who has been sold fake tickets, but has not yet spoken to police to come forward.'

Angels Concierge, the company which the fraudster claimed to work for, today denied any involvement in the scam.

'Someone has clearly been using our name to sell these tickets,' a spokesman said. 'We are really disturbed by what we are reading.'

Beyoncé is currently in the middle of an 11-month tour, the Mrs Carter Show World Tour, which has drawn sell-out audiences in more than 100 countries.
