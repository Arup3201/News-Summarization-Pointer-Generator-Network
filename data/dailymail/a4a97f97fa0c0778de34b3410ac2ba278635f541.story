A man who comfort ate his way to a 50st bulk following his wife's murder has lost an amazing 30st thanks to a lifesaving gastric bypass.

Chuck Turner, 45, from Beaumont in Texas, had become so large, a 25lb lymphedema, a lump caused by a build-up of fluid, had appeared on his leg, putting him in danger of losing it.

His vast frame also put his marriage to his second wife, Nissa, under immense strain and left him unable to play with his adopted son, Nathan.

Chuck's weight began to balloon after he turned to food for comfort following the murder of his first wife

Chuck managed to shed over 400lb following his gastric bypass surgery, but the journey of his weight loss was not easy

Now, a year after having surgery, Chuck lost more than half of his body weight and, for the first time in several years, has been able to return to work.

His re-entry to the jobs market is particularly significant, because at 50st, Chuck had been confined to the sofa, and suffered from a long list of medical problems.

Speaking on TLC show, My 600lb Life, which was filmed before his dramatic weight loss kicked in, Chuck said: 'My weight makes things a lot harder on me, it makes it hard to breathe, it’s hard for me to stand and get around. It’s hard for me to do normal things; my weight has handicapped me.

'I hurt a lot, I have a lymphedema on my leg and right now on a scale of one to 10, the pain is a nine.

At 50st and with a huge growth on his leg, Chuck's movement was restricted and his relationship with his wife and son was suffering

'I’m tired and exhausted and I just can’t keep doing this. I’d rather be a dead man than have to live like this the rest of my life.’

Chuck's weight problems began after he began comfort eating following the tragic murder of his first wife.

'When I was a kid growing up I didn’t see myself getting really big like I am now,' he explains. 'I was a normal sized kid. I’d say it was my thirties when I started putting the weight on gradually.

‘My weight got up to 250lbs, then 280lbs and it reached about 300lbs and then my wife was murdered. It just floored me.'

Wiping away tears, he added: She was a good person, my best friend. I just couldn’t take it so I turned to food.

'I shut the world out and just locked myself away and ate fast food three times a day. I wasn’t even thinking about food – I’d just blank my mind out.'

Chuck's weight was so out of control he was willing to risk surgery in a bid to regain his life

‘For a long time I lost all concept of my weight, and then I went to a scrap metal place to weigh myself. I was 698lb (50st) and I couldn’t believe it.’

Despite dealing with his wife’s murder and his escalating weight, Chuck managed to find love with his second wife, Nissa.

Having struggled with her own weight, Nissa, who met Chuck when he weighed about 600lb, refused to let his excess pounds thwart their relationship.

‘He was very shy and he didn’t want to get out of the truck and introduce himself properly because of his size,' she reveals.

Chuck's inability to help his wife Nissa placed a huge strain on their relationship, as she fulfilled the role of carer, rather than spouse

'I felt like I should give him a chance because I felt all my relationships had failed because of my weight and I didn’t want to judge him for his weight.'

The pair married not long after meeting and adopted a son, who they named Nathan, but Chuck’s weight impinged on his relationship with his new family.

‘He’s the best thing in the world,' says Chuck of his son. 'I’d like to go outside and play with Nathan, but I can hardly walk without getting winded.

‘The main thing that really upsets me is putting a lot of strain on my wife. I can’t do my part of all the things I’m supposed to do. And I want to provide for Nissa, to give her the life she deserves.

‘I think losing weight would make a world of difference; it would make me a better dad and a better husband.

'The thought of leaving her behind, of leaving the baby behind hurts. I’m ready to do something about this weight. I need to get it off or I’m going to die.’

Nissa added: ‘Marriage is extremely difficult when you are married to someone who weighs over 600lb.

'We don’t have any intimate relationship – our marriage is much more caregiver/patient. He eats enough to feed 20 people.

Chuck, pictured awaiting his surgery in the specialist hospital with wife Nissa, had his stomach reduced to just 2.4 ounces during the procedure

‘I just feel like a servant. Being a single mum is one thing, but being a single mum when there’s another human being there is much harder.

'Our family won’t last much longer if something doesn’t change. I want Chuck to get help. I would like for him to have a happy life and have an opportunity to live.'

Sure that weight loss surgery was his only option, Chuck made the decision to travel to a hospital in Houston that specialises in performing weight loss procedures on the morbidly obese.

Speaking ahead of the operation, surgeon Dr Nowzaradan said: ‘Chuck has very unhealthy eating habits and if they continue then surgery won’t be a good option for him.’

At Dr Nowzaradan’s insistence, Chuck embarked on a liquid diet to lose 35lb before going under the knife in a bid to make surgery less risky.

A month after surgery Chuck lost a further 21lb, which is less than expected after such a drastic procedure

Although the surgery was a success, Chuck admits that the first few months after the operation were hard for him to handle.

‘I thought the surgery would take away the cravings, but it hasn’t been that easy. I’m eating less but I still like good food that tastes good.

'Now that the surgery is over and done with, I know what I can eat and how much I can eat. if you’ve eaten more than you’re supposed to it will really make you sick.’

Despite his struggles, a year after the operation, Chuck says he's feeling better than ever and says his dramatic weight loss has helped him rethink his life.

‘It has been really hard,' he admits. 'It is a 
very scary reality. I better wake up and get serious. I always thought I
 was my weight that was the issue, but the reason I put it on was 
because of thing I hadn’t dealt with.

'I
 know I have to come to terms with so many of my issues to get my life 
in order. I don’t know why I get angry like I do. I just lash out, and 
Nissa doesn’t deserve it and I feel so bad when I do.

Chuck initially struggled to readjust his diet after surgery, and his recovery and lack of motivation put a great strain on his marriage

Nissa moving out of the house and threatening him with divorce was a turning point for Chuck, and he began to exercise and stick to his diet

Chuck continued to lose weight, going under the knife for a second time to remove excess skin and his lymphodema, with his dedication encouraging Nissa to give their marriage another try

'I
 realised there was a lot of pain I hadn’t dealt with and it’s been 
eating away at me, creating this anger inside me and driving me to food. So
 many of my issues come from not dealing with the death of my first 
wife.

He added: 'My whole life is changed and I feel like a new man. I’m on the road to being a better husband and father.

'Losing the weight has given me a sense of movement, freedom and confidence. Now I know I can financially provide for my family

A year ago I was a walking dead man. Weight loss surgery has saved my life. I know I have a long way to go but I also know I can do it. I’m ready to move forward with my life.’
