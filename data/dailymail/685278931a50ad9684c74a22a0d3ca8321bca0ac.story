Two housemates decided to give their friend an unwanted Christmas present when they used leftover wrapping paper to cover everything in his bedroom.

Robert Brown and Stuart Morhall thought the perfect gift for best friend Craig Macey would be a festive makeover for his room in their house in Aldershot, Hampshire.

The pranksters used twelve rolls of wrapping paper and three rolls of sticky tape to create the bizarre display.

They spent two days gift-wrapping everything in the Law graduate's room - while he was away over New Year.

Mr Macey was not impressed when he discovered his room had been wrapped up.

He said: 'It was funny and I appreciate the joke, but it wasn't what I wanted after a long drive home.

'It was nice to have more presents to open mind you.'

However the 23-year-old can't complain as it comes as revenge for an earlier prank played on Mr Brown.

The friends decided to redecorate the fitness advisor's room as well.

Mr Brown said: 'A while ago Craig and Stu thought it would be a great decision to decorate my walls with Argos catalogue pages - I had a Saturday job there when I was younger.

'When wrapping up my Christmas presents I noticed that I had a few rolls of paper left over.

'I thought it would be a great time to get my own back.'

Sadly
 the masterpiece only lasted a couple of hours but as Mr Morhall is the 
only one to escape the mischief so far it looks as though he will be 
next.

Mr Macey added: 'Stuart's room is next and the bar has been raised so I would be worried if I was him.'

Last year, MailOnline reported how students used tin foil to wrap up their housemate's room.

Business undergraduate Jake Walker 
returned to his room after a week away to find his housemates had 
covered everything, from his surfboard to his lacrosse sticks, in 
aluminium wrapping.

For good measure, the pranksters had 
also placed hundreds of cups filled with water on the floor, making the 
room look more like a bizarre lunar module than a student's sleeping 
quarters.

'I was absolutely gobsmacked. I was in so much shock,' the 19-year-old Plymouth student said.
