A California boy has returned home to his family after being contained in a special lead-lined hospital room while doctors turned him radioactive, as part of an extreme cancer treatment.

Three-year-old Noah Shin, of San Jose, was last year diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare cancer of the developing nerve cells.

While it’s rare among the general population, it’s the most common cancer in children younger than 1 year of age.

Half the cases are metastatic, which means it spreads to the entire body, and that’s what happened with Noah.

Brave: Three-year-old San Jose boy Noah Shin recently underwent a daring new cancer treatment that turned his person radioactive in an attempt to shrink a collection of tumors that had spread throughout his body

Because of the intensity of the radioactive treatment, the three-year-old has to be confined in this special tank

Scans of his body showed the cancer was pervasive, so much so that chemotherapy was ruled out as being strong enough to treat it.

Noah's parents then transferred him to UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco to try a daring therapy.

The therapy is called MIGB and is administered by IV every two hours over the course of one day.

The drug is inique because only cancerous nerve cells can absorb it.

'It’s a way of delivering high energy radiation to tumors not just in one place but to tumors everywhere in the entire body,' UCSF Pediatric oncologist Doctor Clay Gustafson told KPIX.

'I hope that we can get his disease under control with this therapy. That we can shrink his tumors.'

However, the treatment also turns Noah radioactive.

He must be kept isolated in a lead-shielded room for days to protect his family and the hospital staff.

A big lead plate is placed in front of his crib to protect staff and other patients.

Noah has been described as 'rambunctious' and has charmed the doctors and staff at the hospital

If the tumors are able to be shrunk, doctors may attempt a bone marrow transplant in the hope of curing Noah.

But keeping a three-year-old calm without having any physical contact has proved difficult, and the children who undergo the process need to be sedated.

We need to give him enough sedation to take the edge off, but not so much that they fall into a deep sleep.” said Dr. Arup Roy-Burman, medical director for the UCSF Pediatric ICU.

His mother, Cathy Shin, said the sedative has also helped her.

'It’s helping him relax and it then helps me to relax because now I know he’s not a danger to anybody,' said Cathy Shin.

Cameras positioned around the room allowed the medical team and family could see how Noah was doing inside his container.

Noah has only a 50 percent chance of survival, but doctors are hoping this new therapy will increase that

'I want him to grow up to be a healthy happy normal boy and put this all behind him. That’s my hope,' his mom said.

'I hope he kicks cancer in the butt.'

Children like Noah have about a 50 percent chance of survival.

Noah will be radioactive for a couple of more weeks, but the radiation levels diminish every day.

His parents are now able to hold him.

Noah Shin, 3, of San Jose, California, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma last year

@highlight

It is a rare cancer of the developing nerve cells but common among young children

@highlight

The tumors have spread all over his body and chemotherapy was no longer an effective option

@highlight

He underwent a daring new therapy that uses an IV drug to administer radiation, which attacks only the cancer

@highlight

Noah subsequently becomes radioactive himself and has to be contained in a special lead-lined crib

He has a 50 percent chance of survival
