David Moyes has been offered a route back into management by struggling Spanish side Real Sociedad.

Manager Jagobo Arrasate was dismissed on Sunday after their latest insipid display, a 1-0 loss at home to Malaga that leaves them 19th in La Liga. The club have since approached Moyes, who was sacked by Manchester United in April, in a bid to revive their fortunes.

Former Manchester United manager David Moyes has been offered the top job at Real Sociedad

So what’s the best thing about Real Sociedad if you’re David Moyes?

Moyes had a tough spell at Manchester United and was sacked after less than a season in charge 

You’re not following Fergie; you’re following Arrasate, a hugely inexperienced coach who probably should never have got the job.

How much of a surprise would Moyes taking over be?

Athletic Bilbao showed an interest when he was at Everton so he is known and respected in the Basque country. Sociedad also have a track record of British managers with Chris Coleman and John Toshack both former coaches.

It might be surprising if they end up being able to afford Moyes (right) though. They picked Arrasate because he was the cheapest option.

Horace Harold (Harry) Lowe, 1930-1935

Lowe was a centre half from Northwich in Cheshire who played for Northwich Victoria, Brighton and Hove Albion, Tottenham and Fulham in the first two decades of the 20th century.

He moved to Spain in 1930 and managed Real Sociedad for five season before leading Espanyol. He died in 1966.

John Toshack, 1985-1989/1991-1994/2001-2002

Welsh legend Toshack managed the club in three separate spells spanning three decades. He led Sociedad to the Copa del Rey in 1987, beating Atletico Madrid on penalties in the final.

He returned to San Sebastian after his season at Real Madrid and then again during the 2001-2002 season.

Chris Coleman, 2007-2008

After Toshack had recommended the job to him, Coleman joined Sociedad, then a second division club, in June 2007. He enjoyed success but fell out with newly-elected president Inaki Badiola and resigned in January 2008 with the club fifth in the table.

Weren’t they in the Champions League just last season?

They had the basis of a very good team but as soon as they reached the Champions League they started selling their best players. Asier Illaramendi joined Real Madrid and this summer Atletico Madrid pinched Antoine Greizmann while Claudio Bravo moved to Barcelona. 

So what are the expectations?

Europa League is the realistic aim. Atletico are so strong there is only really one Champions League spot left and Valencia, Sevilla and Bilbao are well ahead in the race for that.

It feels like a great fall from Manchester United?

San Sebastian is a fantastic city. Moyes will be given time and the playing squad is talented. Carlos Vela scores goals, midfielder Ruben Pardo is a huge talent, and defender Inigo Martinez was close to the Spain squad, and to a move to Barcelona, not so long ago. 

The raw materials are there to build a decent team — and he would be given more than one season to do the job this time.
