David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Gordon Brown will join forces this week to promise Scotland more powers from London if voters choose to stay in the UK.

A cross-party plan for increased control over tax, welfare and job creation in Edinburgh would be announced ‘within days’, said Chancellor George Osborne.

As polls point to a surge in support for independence, it was seen as a last throw of the dice for the No campaign – and immediately dismissed as a ‘panicky’ ploy by Alex Salmond.

Mr Osborne said the final touches were being put to proposals for ‘much greater’ fiscal autonomy and tax-raising powers for Holyrood.

However, there was scant detail – and it later emerged that plans will consist of a cross-party convention to hammer out agreement based on devolution proposals already unveiled by the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems. 

‘You will see in the next few days a plan of action to give more powers to Scotland: more tax powers, more spending powers, more plans for powers over the welfare state,’ the Chancellor told BBC1’s Andrew Marr show.

‘That will be put into effect – the timetable for delivering that will be put into effect the moment there is a no vote in the referendum. The clock will be ticking for delivering those powers, and then Scotland will have the best of both worlds.

‘They will both avoid the risks of separation but have more control over their own destiny, which is where I think many Scots want to be.’

The move appeared to be an attempt to mirror the independence referendum in the Canadian province of Quebec in 1995 – when a shock lead by the Yes camp was overturned on polling day after a last-ditch promise of new powers.

A new wave of devolution to Scotland will trigger fierce debate about whether England needs a mechanism to exclude Scottish MPs from voting on matters that no longer affect their constituencies – or even its own parliament. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones insisted that further devolution offered to Scotland should also be offered to Wales.

However, Mr Salmond said the offer lacked any credibility, particularly as it came after postal voters in Scotland have already returned their ballot papers. ‘It shows the chaos, confusion and total disintegration of the no campaign, because quite clearly if you were serious . . . you would tend to announce it before people voted rather than after many people have voted,’ the first minister said.

‘This is a panicky, last-minute measure because the Yes campaign is winning on the ground.’

Scotland’s deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon claimed that it ‘increasingly looks as if the No campaign think people in Scotland are daft’. She said: ‘If the No campaign parties had any serious intention of delivering substantial new powers for Scotland, then why has it taken until ten days before polling day, with a poll showing Yes in the lead, for them to come up with this?’

Stockmarkers were braced for a nervous opening today as investors react to the surprise reversal of fortunes for Scottish nationalists.

The pound could be under pressure after the Yes campaign took the lead in polls.

Last Tuesday, the uncertainty pushed sterling 0.5 per cent lower against the dollar, hitting a five-month low.

Firms with a large presence in Scotland could also suffer today over heightened fears that separation will disrupt businesses and cause costs to spiral. Drinks firm Diageo, which earns about a quarter of its £11.3billion annual sales from Scotch, is concerned a Yes vote could jeopardise European Union membership and international agreements on trade.

Standard Life has also warned over the lack of clarity over what currency an independent Scotland would use, EU membership, and plans for financial regulation and taxation.

Other big firms with a significant Scottish presence include drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline and BP which has warned that it might be forced to rethink investment in the North Sea.

Howard Archer, a chief economist at research firm IHS Global Insight, said: ‘How much further the pressure on sterling ramps up will likely depend on whether polls continue to show the Yes vote improving.

‘The markets hate uncertainty, and it is now not only highly uncertain whether there will be a Yes or No vote in the Scottish referendum, but there is also massive uncertainty over as to whether or not the Scots will be able to keep sterling.’

Claiming there is ‘no guarantee whatsoever’ that Scotland would get a single additional power for its Parliament, she added: ‘I think the debate in Scotland has gone beyond the point where people can be fooled and taken in by empty promises from Westminster parties.’

But former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown hailed the prospect of more powers for Scotland, and derided the focus on personalities and TV debates.

‘This in the end is too important to be about the jokes that someone makes or the way that they make their argument or how they dress or what sort of presentational issues,’ he told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme. 

Mr Brown said he understood the ‘desire for change’ but urged Scotland not to take the ‘easy shortcut’ of independence. ‘

The way to do it over these next few months is to elect a Labour government, to strengthen the Scottish parliament and make it more capable of doing the things we want to do,’ he added. 

Alex Salmond said the offer lacked any credibility, particularly as it came after postal voters in Scotland have already returned their ballot papers

With control over council tax and business rates, the Scottish Government currently raises about 15 per cent of its £30billion budget, with the majority of public spending funded by the UK Treasury.

A radical plan by the LibDems would allow Holyrood to control 60 per cent of its revenue – with full control over inheritance tax, capital gains tax, income tax and a good share of corporation tax.

Labour proposed increasing the figure to 40 per cent by allowing Scotland to control a 15p share of the basic 20p rate of income tax. 

The Tories would allow full control over all rates of income tax, with a reduced Treasury grant. VAT levels must remain the same under EU rules, but a share of the revenue from Scotland would be controlled by Holyrood. MSPs would also be allowed to ‘supplement’ welfare benefits.

Mr Osborne also accused Mr Salmond of not ‘telling the straight truth’ about what currency an independent Scotland would use.

He argued that a proposal to keep the pound would not be accepted by Westminster – likening it to a divorced couple continuing to share a bank account.
