Pebble has revealed a colour version of its popular smartwatch in a bid to fend off Apple and Google.

Called Pebble Time, the firm has turned to Kickstarter, where it funded its original watch, for the £$199 colour version.

The campaign has already been a huge success - with Pebble hitting its target in just seventeen minutes.

The Pebble Time will cost $199 and will ship in May - although is cheaper for Kickstarter backers

Pebble Time features a new colour e-paper display and microphone for responding to notifications, meaning it can also do voice dictation and even calls. 

'At its heart, Pebble Time is an awesome watch,' the firm says.'The new color e-paper display is easy to read and always-on, perfect for displaying incoming notifications and your favorite watchface.'

Pebble hopes the battery life of its watch will be a major selling point - both the Apple Watch and Google's Android Wear watches need to be recharged every night.

'Compared with display technology like LCD or OLED, power consumption is minimized, enabling Pebble Time to achieve an industry-leading battery life of up to 7 days.'

However, the screen is far lower resolution, and can only display 64 colours. 

'It's not going to break any records for number of pixels or whatever,' Eric Migicovsky of Pebble told Backchannel.

'But it does what it has to do to be on a smart watch. 

'It's color, it's always on and it uses, for all intents and purposes, the exact same power as our black-and-white display.'

The watch will also be able to be fitted with any standard watch strap 

The watch is also far thinner, at just 9.5mm. 

'Its ergonomic, curved design fits comfortably on either wrist and slides easily under dress shirts,' the firm says.

The new design was first leaked yesterday on Pebble's own website. 

The watch has a new 'timeline interface to allow people to see information depending on what's in their diary or the time of day.

According to 9to5mac, the new watch is set to have a thinner design and a colour e-paper-like display.

It spotted an image showing off the watch on Pebble's own servers. 

'Now, thanks to an image hosted on Pebble's own servers, we have a look at a device with a physical appearance matching the device we described. 

'The device looks to have a larger bezel, as well as buttons that are smaller compared to its predecessor.'

As we reported, the watch is going to be thinner than the current generation, but you can't really see that based on this image alone. 

The new watch is also far thinner, at just 9.5mm.

And while the new device will have a color display and a slimmer hardware profile, it's said to have battery life that compares to the first generation Pebble. 

On the inside, the next Pebble is going to have a Cortex M4 processor and a 6-axis gyroscope. Unlike the Apple Watch, the new Pebble won't have a touch screen, and its resolution is definitely on the low side compared to Apple's upcoming device.

Compatibility: The smartwatch is compatible with Android 2.3+ and iOS 5+

Connectivity: The Pebble connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth

Messaging: Wearers can see texts, tweets, calls and app notifications – but they can't use the watch to type messages or make calls, like with the Apple Watch, for example.

Battery: The battery lasts for between five and seven days on a single charge and can be recharged using a USB cable with a magnetic connector.

Tough: The watch is water resistant with a scratch and shatter-proof e-paper screen.

Screen: 144 x 168 pixels, measuring 3.2cm

Apps: The watch has a 'thriving' app store with staples like Twitter as well as fitness apps. Users can also create their own. The Pebble can store eight apps and watch faces at a time.

Extras: A vibrating silent alarm and hundreds of watch faces.

Colours: White, black, red, grey and orange.

Size: The watch is designed to fit most 2.2cm watch straps. It measures 5.2cm x 3.6cm x 1.15cm deep.

Weight: 38g

Price: £99 ($99 in the US) and £180 ($199) for the Steel model.

The current watch allows wearers to read texts and tweets on their wrist, as well as see incoming calls, check the weather, access fitness apps and tell the time.

It is compatible with Apple and Android devices and connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth so users don't have to rummage in their handbag or pockets for their phone to see app notifications and messages, because they appear on the watch's screen.

Pebble's device is the second most funded product in Kickstarter history and the new Pebble Steel model is also now available in the UK for £180.

The Apple Watch is set to go on sale in April, with prices from $349

They are water resistant and have a battery that lasts for between five and seven days. In contrast, it's predicted that the Apple Watch, which is due to be released early next year, will need to be recharged daily.

Firebox predicts that the already popular devices will be in demand from UK customers for Christmas, partly because they are more affordable than some rival offerings.

Since its US release last year, Pebble has developed its open-source platform so that anyone can create an app for the device and companies are offering fitness tracker apps like Jawbone and Misfit, so people can check their running pace without carrying another gadget, for example.

The upadter Pebble watch, called Pebble Steel, has an e-paper display – like a miniature Kindle – so it can be easily read in bright sunlight, while a flick of the wrist illuminates the screen so it can be used in a the dark.

The watch has an e-paper display – like a miniature Kindle – so it can be easily read in bright sunlight, while a flick of the wrist illuminates the screen so it can be used in a the dark too.  

Staples such as Twitter, Yelp and Foursquare are available too.

There are also 'extras' like a vibrating alarm and a choice of hundreds of watch face designs.
