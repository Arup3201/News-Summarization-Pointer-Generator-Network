Tottenham will target players aged 26 and under this summer in a move that rubber-stamps Mauricio Pochettino’s policy of giving youth a platform to shine. 

He and recently-appointed head of recruitment Paul Mitchell are devising a clear strategy ahead of the next transfer window. 

The Argentine wants players who have the energy and fitness levels to suit his high intensity style of play, and he feels younger players are a necessity.

The purchase of Roberto Soldado from Valencia has not worked out as either party would have liked

Having sold Gareth Bale to Real Madrid, chairman Daniel Levy spent £68million on proven internationals in Erik Lamela, Roberto Soldado and Paulinho — but they have failed to impress, and the club are prepared for a major loss if they can offload Soldado and Paulinho in the summer.

Pochettino has shown his penchant for signing hungry and unproven talent; the captures of Dele Alli, 18, Eric Dier, 21, and DeAndre Yedlin, 21, are testament to that. 

Erik Lamela has also been disappointing for the north London club having arrived from Roma

Tottenham already have a youthful look with Harry Kane, Nabil Bentaleb, Ryan Mason, Kyle Walker, Christian Eriksen and Danny Rose all under 26. 

Southampton trio Toby Alderweireld, 26, Morgan Schneiderlin, 25, and Jay Rodriguez, 25, are among the club’s targets, while Burnley’s Danny Ings and Cologne centre back Kevin Wimmer, both 22, are also on Pochettino’s radar.
