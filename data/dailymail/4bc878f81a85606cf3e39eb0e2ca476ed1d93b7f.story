A 47-year-old convicted criminal has been charged today after a teenage girl was found in a lake with weights tied to her body.

Anthony Balbirnie faces a federal charge of abandoning a corpse. His on-off girlfriend, who has not been named, told 
investigators she saw him wrapping a girl's body and placing it in 
the trunk of his car in the early hours of September 21.

Khighla Parks, 15, was last seen on September 20. She was found ten days later 
in Truman Lake, southwest Missouri by fishermen. It is believed that she
was already dead when dumped in the water but cause of death has not 
been released.

Dallas County Sheriff's Office also announced earlier today they were seeking two persons of interest - Desiree Siddens, 24, and Larry Warner, 39 - in the murder investigation.

Connection: Anthony Balbirnie, 47, has been charged with abandoning a body after 15-year-old Khighla Parks was found dumped in a Missouri lake

Innocence: The 15-year-old girl was last seen leaving her home on September 20

Balbirnie was arrested on Monday after a car chase that began in Greene County and ended in Dallas County, Kansas. Deputies said Balbirnie threw something from the car during the 45-minute chase but they don't know what.

The abandonment charge had been filed on Sunday but was not revealed until today. Court documents said Balbirnie told a woman he was taking the body to Warsaw, close to Truman lake. 

The drug dealer had been the only 
suspect in the case but it was not known today if anyone else was being investigated.

The relationship between Balbirnie and Miss Parks is unknown although they were friends on Facebook. The Dallas County Sheriff's Department was unclear as to when Balbirnie's path crossed with Miss Parks.

The teenager was reported missing on 
September 20 after she left her grandparents' home in Willard to go for a walk.

She was last seen at a party in Buffalo, Missouri with a crowd of people, around 40 miles away.

The girl's grandmother Bonnie Adams told KY3: 'She
had taken off a few days, went to a friend's house or something like 
that, so I gave her the 24 hours.

'I always believed you need to give 
them some space, but you also need to know where they're at.'

Balbirnie was released from prison on 
parole in August after serving 15 months for possessing marijuana, according to the Missouri Department of Corrections.

He was on 
probation for convictions in 2010 for unlawful use of weapons, 
manufacturing a controlled substance and resisting arrest with the 
intent to cause physical harm or death by fleeing.

The 47-year-old has a long history of criminal charges from drug possession to resisting arrest.

Grisly death: The teenage girl's body was pulled from Truman Lake in southwest Missouri where it had been tied down with weights

Friends and family of the 15-year-old
had started a Facebook page in her honor. The teenager's funeral is 
being held this Friday at Clear Creek Baptist Church.

Balbirnie's
Facebook page has a profile picture of a latex mask with swastika. He 
describes himself as 'outgoing and energetic, likes to take long walks 
in the woods'.

Police 
considered him a suspect in an attempted abduction in 2006 when a girl 
was allegedly taken against her will from a hotel room.

The girl came 
home and although Balbirnie was the main suspect no charges were brought
against him.

Distraught: The teenager's grandmother Bonnie Adams wept as she said that she tried to allow the girl some freedom while always knowing where she was
