Rosie Huntington-Whiteley may have recently said that her looks won't last forever but judging by her new M&S campaign, she hasn't got to worry about them fading just yet.

The former Victoria's Secret Angel has unveiled and modelled her self designed range of lingerie for the high-street giant and looks flawless in every single shot.

The 27-year-old showcases the new Rosie for Autograph collection of smoothing, everyday lingerie to perfection as she poses in a bedroom in the romantic shots.

Showcasing her designs: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has designed a new range of lingerie for M&S, which aims to be flattering and practical

Rosie 
describes the lingerie range as 'her baby' and her latest collection has
 been designed using a luxurious, light-weight fabric, chosen for its 
slinky and super-soft feel.

The 20-piece collection comprises 
balcony, bralet and plunge bra shapes with multi-way straps and 
brushed inner cups for softness, as well as a slip, body and 
Brazilian, thong and high-waisted knicker styles.

The range, which is priced between £10.50 for knickers and £35 for the slip, will be available in stores on August 2.

Head of Lingerie Design, Soozie 
Jenkinson, who works closely with Rosie on her ranges said: ‘Rosie and I
 are so excited about the launch of our new Rosie for Autograph lingerie
 collection.

What's her secret? Rosie works out with James Duigan and loves sipping on green smoothies, which she tries to make every single morning

Enviable curves: Rosie shows off her healthy figure in the new imagery, which was shot in a Parisian style boudoir

'Building on the success of the exquisite silk and lace pieces our customers love, the new collection brings a touch of luxury to everyday lingerie essentials. Combining femininity with functionality and versatility, the bras are designed to work hard under your clothes for a smooth silhouette.’

Rosie looks the epitome of health in the new imagery. So what's her secret? The model works out with James Duigan, the man behind the hugely successful Clean & Lean empire.

Rosie met James several years ago and is such a fan that she penned the 
introduction to his book Clean & Lean: Flat Tummy Fast.

Rosie said: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine.

'What
 I've learned through working with James is that by focusing on creating
 a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things, faster than I
 ever thought possible. Oh, and by the way, nobody can get a stomach as 
flat as James can!'

Rosie recently opened up about her looks in an interview with Industrie magazine explaining why it's important for her to be more than a pretty face.

'I realised early on that nothing lasts 
forever, especially as a model - you have to build something for 
yourself from it. Looks go and you fade. Modelling is short lived,' she said.

'I
 wanted something for when I want to take a back seat. There'll be a 
brand that I'll be sitting at the helm of and enjoying. This is really 
the start of something I see as a long-term thing.'

'I see my career as work. I don't see it as a lifestyle,' she added.

In 2012, she began collaborating with M&S on her Rosie for Autograph lingerie line.

She's currently sold more than half a 
million bras in more than 200 stores - and receives personal messages 
from customers praising her pieces.

'I
 get tweets every single day from women sending me pictures of 
themselves in their lingerie, their Rosie for Autograph, telling me how 
their experience was purchasing it and how special they feel in it and 
how confortable it is. It's been overwhelmingly positive and very 
humbling for me- you set out to do something and to make,' she said.

But of course, underwear is an area in which she's an expert.

'I have 
been modelling lingerie for most of my career,' she told the crowd at 
the Vogue Festival in March, adding: 'It is something I have felt 
confident doing and I love it. Clothes are usually trickier because 
there is a lot more to them!'

The
 model and actress is also currently gearing up to star in Mad Max: Fury 
Road, alongside Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz and Tom 
Hardy.
