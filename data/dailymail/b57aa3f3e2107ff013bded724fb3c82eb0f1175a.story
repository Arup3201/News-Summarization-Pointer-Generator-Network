South Korea has been condemned by environmental groups and the international community after revealing plans to resume whale hunting for research purposes.

The Asian nation has informed the International Whaling Commission of its plans, after claiming it wants to resume whaling to help study the types and amount of fish whales eat.

But critics believe these plans are a back-door effort to make the country only the fourth world nation to allow commercial whaling since an international ban came into force in 1986.

'Research': Japanese workers whale hunting in 2005. South Korea claims its whale hunting will also be for 'scientific purposes'

Korean officials said the whaling would be aimed only at studying the types and amounts of fish whales eat, as fishermen complain an increasing number of whales are consuming large amounts of fish stocks.

The IWC gives member states sovereign rights to scientific whaling but South Korea will still give up its whaling plans if the international organisation rejects them, officials said.

Various exceptions have allowed Japan, Iceland and Norway to hunt whales anyway. Indigenous groups in several countries also whale as allowed under international rules.

Japan claims its hunts are for research purposes, though the meat from the killed whales mostly ends up in restaurants, stores and school lunches.

The
IWC moratorium on whaling introduced in 1986 permits lethal research on
whales, with the meat then allowed to be used for consumption. This 
loophole is already widely used by Japan.

Other loopholes in the ruling also allow Iceland and Norway to hunt whales anyway.

Before the ban in 1986, South Korea claimed it caught about 600 whales a year, and that most of the meat was consumed.

However, recent records have shown the Asian market for whale meat may not be as lucrative as officials thought.

A 2006 survey found that 95% of Japanese people rarely or never eat whale meat.

This
comes despite campaigners claiming Japanese whalers used 2.28million 
Yen (Â£19m/US$30m) from its earthquake recovery fund to subsidise an 
Antarctic whale hunt last year.

Whaling
is now subject to prosecution and punishable by a jail or fines, but 
meat is available from mostly minke that get caught in fishing nets 'by 
accident' or wash ashore.

South Korean officials said they have not decided what to do with the whale meat following the studies.

The leaders of Australia and New Zealand quickly condemned South Korea's plans and said they would raise diplomatic protests.

'We think it would be a terrible step in the wrong direction,' New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said during a visit to Sydney.

Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard told a news conference that she was 'very disappointed' at the South Korean announcement.

'We are completely opposed to whaling, there's no excuse for scientific whaling,' she said.

'We believe this move is a thinly veiled attempt by Korea to conduct commercial whaling under the guise of scientific research, similar to hunts conducted by Japan in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary,' said Wendy Elliott, head of global environmental group WWF's delegation to IWC.

Speaking at an IWC meeting today in Panama City, Prime Minister Gillard added: 'We will make our voices heard today.

'Our ambassador will speak to counterparts in South Korea at the highest levels of the South Korea government and indicate Australia's opposition to this decision.'

Australia has filed a complaint against Japan at the International Court of Justice in The Hague to stop scientific whaling. A decision is expected in 2013 or later.

New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully said the announcement was a setback to global conservation efforts as whales in its waters were already targeted by Japan.

'The portrayal of this initiative as a 'scientific' program will have no more credibility than the so-called scientific program conducted by Japan, which has long been recognized as commercial whaling in drag,' he said in a statement.
