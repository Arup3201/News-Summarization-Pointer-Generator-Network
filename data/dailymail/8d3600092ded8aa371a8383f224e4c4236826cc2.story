The types of drugs taken at music festivals often varies depending on the lineup, police figures show.

Records of the substances seized at 10 major festivals over the past four years indicate how common drug use is and how, while fans at one event are more likely to be found in possession of cannabis, those at another might prefer cocaine or ecstasy.

The data, which comes to light as legions of music fans gear up for the summer festival season, also shows seizures of cannabis and cocaine are falling - with the trend thought to be down to changes in festival-goers' habits, demographics and police tactics.

Use of cocaine, a relatively expensive class-A substance at around £40 a gram, appears to have dropped particularly dramatically as cash-strapped festival crowds look to cheaper drugs such as the horse transquilliser ketamine.

According to the figures, compiled and analysed by the Guardian, last year saw officers confiscate drugs with a total street value of more than £100,000, with almost £45,000 of that from Glastonbury alone.

Large quantities of cannabis and ecstasy were taken from revellers at the Somerset event, but higher still were the figures for ketamine and the stimulant piperazine.

Glastonbury organiser Michael Eavis insists there is no drug problem at his festival, where substances worth £200,000 have been seized over four years

Most of last year's cocaine seizures were made at the Isle of Wight festival and, together with Bestival, which also takes places on the island, it accounted for most of the ecstasy confiscated across the 10 festivals.

It is thought the differences in the range of drugs brought to such events is linked partly to the acts on stage.

Womad (World of Music, Arts and Dance) is a much smaller music festival than the likes of Glastonbury and Bestival and the crowds it draws are typically older and middle-class, with a taste for obscure world music.

While headliners at Glastonbury 2011 included bands famed for their lyrics about drug-fuelled excess - Primal Scream or Queens of the Stone Age, for example - last year's Womad fans could be found contemplating Senegalese singer Baaba Maal or flamenco stars Rodrigo Y Gabriela.

Cannabis was the only illegal substance seized by police at the Wiltshire festival, with a street value of just £151.

Meanwhile, Download in Leicestershire and Sonisphere at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, might have been dominated by heavy metal acts, but it seems relatively few fans were out to emulate the rock star lifestyle.

Police at Sonisphere, where 190,000 people flocked to watch Metallica and Slipknot, made a fairly modest haul worth £413. This was made up of cannabis and a small amount of cocaine, while ecstasy and amphetamines - more commonly associated with dance music - were not found.

After Glastonbury and the two events on the Isle of Wight, the fourth largest drugs haul was at V festival, held at Hylands Park in Chelmsford and Weston Park in South Staffordshire. The total value of £7,111 was mostly made up of cannabis and ecstasy, but piperazine also featured.

Changing habits: Cannabis seizures are falling, as are those of cocaine - but lesser known substances such as ketamine and BZP are on the rise

The twin festivals at Reading and Leeds saw similar totals of £804 and £797 respectively, though cannabis and methadone were the most common at Reading while at Leeds it was cocaine and mephedrone.

Finally, drugs confiscated at Wireless, in London's Hyde Park, were worth a total of £585, including cannabis and unknown Class A tablets.

At Glastonbury, where organiser Michael Eavis last year denied there was a drug problem, more than £200,000 worth of drugs has been seized in four years. At £44,869, the value of substances confiscated at the 2011 festival marked a 12 per cent increase on the previous year, though this was still lower than the peak in 2009.

The value of piperazine seized, also known as BZP, has seen a tenfold rise over four years, though it is still less than half as common as each of cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine.

Ketamine, known as a 'party drug' popular among younger users, also appears to be on the rise and was most commonly found at Glastonbury.
