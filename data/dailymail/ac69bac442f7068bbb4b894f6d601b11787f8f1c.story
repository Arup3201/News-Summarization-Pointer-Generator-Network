Roma midfielder Radja Nainggolan was once a target for Manchester United and the 26-year-old put in a respectable performance at the heart of the home side’s midfield. 

The same, unfortunately, cannot be said of his hair. Sporting a peroxide blond mohican, Nainggolan was an unmissable presence throughout at the Stadio Olimpico. 

The possibility of a midfield partnership with his fellow afro-haired Belgian Marouane Fellaini in the Barclays Premier League at United is something of a hair-raising prospect.

Their senior side might have struggled in Europe this season but the same can’t be said for City’s youth side. They smashed four past Roma with no reply in the UEFA Youth League to finish top of Group E with an impressive six wins out of six group games ahead of Bayern Munich. They are the only side in the competition with a 100 per cent win record. How the first team could do have done with form like that... 

Man City keeper Joe Hart removes an object off the pitch on Wednesday night

Defender Gael Clichy was targeted with laser pens during Champions League tie

City will have expected to face a hostile reception in what was a crucial tie for both sides, and the Roma fans were only too keen to oblige from the first whistle. Early in the game several City players, including Gael Clichy, were targeted with laser pens, while Joe Hart was seen removing an object, which looked like a deodorant can, that seemed to have been thrown on to the pitch from the stands at the Stadio Olimpico.

The City bench erupted when Samir Nasri scored the key opening goal, but David Silva was busy tying his laces on the touchline. As soon as he realised City were ahead, though, he gave a half-hearted celebration. Better late than never, David.
