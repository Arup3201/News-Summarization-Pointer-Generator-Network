James Rodriguez is a major doubt for Real Madrid's Club World Cup campaign after medical tests revealed he has injured a muscle in his right leg. 

Real, currently on an 18-game winning streak, confirmed in a statement that Rodriguez has a grade one muscle injury in his calf.

The European champions did not indicate how long they expect Rodriguez to be out but coach Carlo Ancelotti said he hoped he could have his player back in time for a possible final of the Club World Cup on December 20.

'Tests showed he has a small injury,' said Ancelotti. 'We don't have much time left before the final, but there is a small possibility that he could play the game on the 20th.'

Rodriguez, 23, sustained the injury during Saturday's La Liga win over Celta Vigo.

Real play Ludogorets in the Champions League on Tuesday and Almeria in the Spanish league on Friday before travelling to Morocco for their first match at the Club World Cup on December 16.

Rodriguez, who signed with the Champions League winners this summer after a superb World Cup where he top scored with six goals, has appeared in all 24 games Madrid have played across all competitions, scoring nine goals.
