A university student had to be rescued by fire crews after he got stuck in a tiny bin that automatically locked on him when he jumped in as a prank.

Robin Niven was walking home from a night out with friends in Manchester when he spotted the front hatch was open on a roadside bin.

He climbed inside and his tipsy housemates kicked the door shut as a joke - only to find it automatically locked with Mr Niven inside.

Emergency: After trying to tip the bin over, the student's friends called the fire brigade to help

'We’ve all tried pulling the door at the same time, and we’ve tried tipping it.' 

A fire crew arrived and used a special tool to simply turn the lock on the bin and free cramped Mr Niven after half an hour stuck inside.

He was so relieved to escape, he hugged his rescuers, holding his arms aloft in celebration as he walked free from the waste receptacle.
