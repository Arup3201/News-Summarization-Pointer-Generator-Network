Andrew Mitchell had a second run-in with police in Downing Street, it emerged yesterday.

Just 12 hours after launching a foul-mouthed rant at officers who would not let him cycle through the main gates, the Tory Chief Whip returned the next morning and demanded to be let through again.

The revelation came as David Cameron risked enraging police by saying he believed Mr Mitchell’s account – given to him in a face to face meeting with the Chief Whip on Friday – that he had not called the police ‘plebs’. In doing so, Mr Cameron is effectively branding members of his own protection team liars.

Police will soon have to let Mr Mitchell in through the main gates of Downing Street – because he has demanded a chauffeur-driven ministerial Jaguar.

He was horrified when he was appointed Tory Chief Whip two weeks ago and told he would not get a car.

He told civil servants that he must have a dedicated vehicle for himself and his fellow whips.

But while most ministers use an eco-friendly Toyota Prius, Mr Mitchell has insisted on a gas- guzzling Jag for the 200-yard trip between Downing Street and the Commons – a walk of around three minutes.

The demand has staggered civil servants since whips do not have public engagements.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘There have been discussions about use of a ministerial car for the whips’ office, not for his exclusive use.’

A Whitehall source said that a final decision has not been made about the model of car, but Mr Mitchell had requested a Jaguar.

The Prime Minister’s decision to back Mr 
Mitchell raised questions about his judgment as details emerged of the 
Chief Whip’s brazen second attempt to use the gates after the initial 
confrontation last Wednesday.

A Whitehall source said: ‘He had another go the morning after and tried to go through the main gate but was told to use the pedestrian gate to the side.

'This time there was no altercation or unpleasantness. But it’s still unbelievable.’

To make things worse for Mr Cameron, London Mayor Boris Johnson said he was ‘very glad’ the police threatened to arrest Mr Mitchell for breach of the peace during the initial encounter.

Two senior Government sources last night said Mr Mitchell would have to make a third apology for his behaviour – following a statement and a ‘car crash’ on-camera interview on Monday.

‘He won’t be made to do it, but he’s going to have to say something more,’ one official said.

Colleagues expressed dismay that Mr Mitchell was not showing the level of regret that the affair merited.

One said: ‘The trouble is that Andrew doesn’t appear very contrite.’

In the first detailed account of the showdown between Mr Cameron and Mr Mitchell last Friday, a source last night said Mr Mitchell had put Mr Cameron in a ‘difficult position’ by denying to his face that he had hurled the toxic insult ‘plebs’ at police after they refused to open the gates for his bicycle.

‘Andrew looked the Prime Minister in the eye and said he did not say those things,’ the source said. ‘To sack him in those circumstances would have been to call him a liar.’

Mr Cameron yesterday read the full 
police account of the incident for the first time after an officer’s 
statement was leaked to the press.

Andrew Mitchell said he’d had a ‘long, frustrating day’ before his rant at police.

Yesterday it emerged part of that day had involved a curry lunch at the upmarket Cinnamon Club in Westminster.

There he ‘politely’ tucked into roasted plaice fillet with Bengali spiced crab (£9.50) and hot and sweet king prawns with basmati rice (£24).

After his Downing Street confrontation he is understood to have gone for another meal, at the Carlton Club in St James’s.

But although the account flatly contradicts Mr Mitchell’s version of events, a senior Government source said it would make no difference to the Prime Minister’s decision.

‘The Prime Minister was very angry about what happened and told the Chief Whip to apologise,’ the source said. ‘That apology was accepted and that should be the end of the matter.’

But the revelation that Mr Cameron sided with Mr Mitchell before hearing the full police account will raise further questions. The source insisted the Prime Minister was not accusing the police officers involved of lying, but felt there was a genuine difference of recollection about the exact words used.

However, senior police officers expressed irritation that the integrity of the officers involved is in question and that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has refused to hold an investigation.

Irene Curtis, of the Police Superintendents’ Association, said: ‘This has gone beyond the words that were said. It’s an issue of integrity for the officer. By challenging the officer’s version of events he is actually challenging the officer’s integrity and for a police officer that is a really serious matter.’

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mr Cameron of trying to sweep the row under the carpet. She said: ‘It now looks like there’s a cover-up going on.’

A source denied ministers were ‘reluctant’ to speak up publicly for the Chief Whip.

Instead Mr Mitchell was defended yesterday by one of  his two daughters who emerged from the family home in London to tell reporters: ‘I can tell  you one thing, my father is an honest man.’

Colleagues revealed that Mr Mitchell once told officials he was a ‘Big Swinging D***’ and insisted in his last job on being served hot drinks in a mug bearing the inscription ‘Secretary of State for International Development’. Officials at that department apparently threw a party when he left.

He himself may enjoy the trappings of privilege, but Andrew Mitchell has some distinctly plebeian skeletons in his ancestral closet.

It transpires that the family of the public school-educated Tory Chief Whip – who once boasted he was the fourth Mitchell to be an MP – had some humble beginnings.

His grandmother on his mother’s side, Ellen M Haysey, was born in Forest Gate, East London and is listed on the 1911 census as a general servant.

Mr Mitchell’s great grandmother, also called Ellen, is listed on the 1901 census as a 37-year-old charwoman from Bow, East London.

And his great, great, grandfather was a labourer who changed jobs and retired as a railway guard while his great grandfather is listed in the 1891 census as a telegraph lineman.

Debra Chatfield, a historian from findmypast.co.uk said: ‘The information from our archives shows that Mr Mitchell’s family history is one of blue-collar workers and humble beginnings, rather than aristocracy or inherited privilege.’

Clearly his family have come a long way. The minister and his wife Sharon have an enviable property portfolio consisting of three homes in Britain and a ski chalet in France.

Their impressive town house in Islington is mortgage-free and is believed to be worth £2million.

It is said to boast a magnificent  wine cellar.

Mr Mitchell’s knowledge of good wine might stem from some more successful ancestors who set up the famous El Vino wine merchants in 1879. El Vino was sold in a £7million deal ten years ago, earning Mr Mitchell £630,000 for his 9 per cent stake.

Mr Mitchell and his wife also own a country retreat in a Nottinghamshire village near his former constituency of Gedling where he was MP from 1987 until 1997. The property is believed to be worth around £500,000.

Meanwhile the House of Commons register of members’ financial interests reveals Mr Mitchell receives a rental income ‘from time to time’ from a chalet he owns in the French ski resort of Val d’Isere.

He also has a £300,000 terraced house in his Midlands constituency of Sutton Coldfield. During the MPs’ expenses scandal it was revealed he had claimed more than £12,000 for cleaning, redecorating, gardening and furnishing at  the home.

It also emerged he had claimed 13p for Tippex and 45p for a stick of glue on his Parliamentary expenses.
