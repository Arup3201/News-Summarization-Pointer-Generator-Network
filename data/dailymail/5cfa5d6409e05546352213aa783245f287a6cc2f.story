Hatem Ben Arfa and Gaston Ramirez made a scoring start to life in Hull City’s colours during a behind-closed-doors game with West Brom on Tuesday afternoon.

The pair – both deadline-day loan signings – staked their claim for a starting spot when the Tigers host West Ham on Monday after scoring in the 2-2 draw at the Baggies’ training ground.

Steve Bruce has plenty to ponder selection wise after bringing in Ben Arfa from Newcastle and Southampton playmaker Ramirez on season-long loans, as well as the permanent signings of Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez and West Ham midfielder Mo Diame.

Positive start: Hatem Ben Arfa scored for Hull in a behind-closed-doors match at West Brom's training ground

New signing: Steve Bruce decided to bring in Southampton's Gaston Ramirez on a season-long loan deal

Harry Maguire, Yannick Sagbo and Liam Rosenior also featured for Hull in the friendly at West Brom.

Hull have claimed four points from their opening three Premier League games against Queens Park Rangers, Stoke and Aston Villa.

Bruce's side will be hoping to get back to winning ways against West Ham after losing 2-1 to Aston Villa before the international break.

Selection dilemma: Bruce must decide whether to throw his new signings straight into his starting line-up
