Two serving soldiers died last night after their car hit a tree near their Army base.

A 23-year-old man and 20-year-old female recruit were fatally injured in the accident yesterday just after 8pm close to Catterick Garrison, near Richmond, North Yorkshire.

The man, who was driving a black Seat Leon on Leyburn Road at the time, died in the crash, while the woman died shortly afterwards at Darlington Memorial Hospital.
