A JetBlue flight was forced into an emergency landing this afternoon after one of the planes evacuation slides deployed mid-flight inside the aircraft.

The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed that JetBlue Flight 1266 from Fort Meyers to Boston landed at Orlando and reported no injuries to the 74 passengers and 4 crew.

The compromised Embraer E-190 aircraft touched down at around 3.45 p.m. and taxied to a gate where passengers were led off the flight via a rear exit.

A JetBlue plane was diverted to Orlando on Wednesday after an emergency evacuation slide opened in flight, according to the Federal Aviation Administration

JetBlue spokesman Loren Duran confirmed the incident saying that a slide 'partially deployed into the front galley and that no injuries were reported.'

'The aircraft was taken out of service for further inspection. Customers will be reaccommodated on another aircraft to Boston with an estimated scheduled departure of 5:00 p.m. local time.'

Flight Tracker showed that the aircraft had only just cleared the coast of Florida when the slide accidently deployed.

The National Transportation Safety Board said through their Twitter feed that they are gathering information on the incident.

It was not clear what caused the slide to deploy inside the aircraft cabin.

The Embraer E-190 aircraft made a safe landing at the Orlando International Airport at 3:45 p.m
