With her newborn son snuffling safely and healthily in her arms, Funke Oham wept tears of joy and relief. Reaching for her phone, there was one person she needed to call: the dear friend who had been by her side throughout the pregnancy.

Never mind that the next morning was Christmas Day, she knew her delighted friend would drop everything to race to the hospital to see the new arrival. As predicted, she swept in, threw her arms around her friend, and wept unashamedly with the new family.

The friend was Ansam Al-Habib — who was Funke’s obstetrician at North Middlesex University Hospital, London. Miss Al-Habib knew more than anyone what this baby meant to Funke and her husband Charles, a lecturer at Greenwich University.

Ten months earlier, they had lost their daughter, Faith, after Funke miscarried at 23 weeks. A year before that, the couple’s son, Isaac, was stillborn at full term at another London hospital after Funke’s placenta detached and starved her unborn child of oxygen.

‘The shock of losing Isaac was like a physical blow,’ says Funke quietly. ‘I hit such a low, and after Faith, the grief threatened to swallow me up again. Losing her was so awful I couldn’t even face telling my parents what had happened, because I felt so sorry for them.’

As Funke struggled to come to terms with the ‘indescribable’ pain of Faith’s death, she discovered she was pregnant again. The news couldn’t have come at a more distressing time, for two days later she had to return to North Middlesex where Faith had been born to hear the results of the post-mortem on her daughter.

‘I tried to force myself to stay positive, but I was full of such emptiness and fear I could hardly dare imagine that this pregnancy would work.’

‘She handed me her mobile phone number 
and told me to ring her, day or night, promising, “I’m here for you 
every step of the way”.’

When she first met Miss Al-Habib, Funke, 36, who lives in Chingford, and runs a woman’s mentoring network, was overwrought with a mixture grief and hormones.

‘But this lovely doctor was so comforting, calm and determined that I instantly felt more at ease. I had seen many different doctors before, but I never felt that anyone personally cared about me and my babies. At best, they had been kind but remote.

‘Miss Al-Habib had been asked to go through the results of the post-mortem with me. She was so kind and caring that I blurted out: “I’m pregnant again and I am hoping I will be looked after by you”. I had this sudden, spontaneous feeling that she was the right doctor to help me become a mother.

‘She handed me her mobile phone number and told me to ring her, day or night, promising, “I’m here for you every step of the way”.’

The post-mortem showed no reason for Funke’s early labour, which only increased her anxiety.

‘But she said she would do her very best to make sure this pregnancy progressed well, and promised she would monitor me personally throughout. She was good to her word. Any time I felt a twinge — often in the evenings, when she was at home — I would text or ring. Without fail, she would ring straight back or text.

‘I contacted her countless times, and would always apologise for being silly. She would say: “There’s no such thing as a silly question.”’ Funke says: ‘It gave me confidence. By the last two months of pregnancy, I had a scan every two weeks to ensure the baby was growing as normal. A couple of times, the scans didn’t show the baby clearly enough, so Miss Al-Habib would stop what she was doing and scan me herself.

‘Nothing was ever too much trouble. I had the feeling it was as important to her as it was to me that this baby would make it.’

Miss Al-Habib arranged for Funke to have a temporary stitch placed in the cervix to prevent premature labour — this carries a small risk of miscarriage, which was clearly worrying for Funke and Charles.

‘But Miss Al-Habib dealt with my endless questions and worries with a wonderful calmness.’ And it worked: baby Jeremiah was delivered at 37 weeks on Christmas Eve 2007.

‘When he was born, there was silence and I froze,’ recalls Funke. ‘I thought “Oh no, not again”. But then he gasped and cried and I just burst into tears. Feeling him squirming and moving in my arms is a moment I will treasure forever.

‘I always dreamed of hearing a little voice call me “Mummy”, and thanks to this wonderful doctor, that dream has come true.’

‘I texted Miss Al-Habib, because I wanted her to know he was here and he was safe. She came in on her holiday just to see us. She hugged me and Charles and wept when she saw Jeremiah.’

But it’s not just Miss Al-Habib’s care and kindness that makes her so special, says another mother Alexia Alexandrou, it’s her willingness to go the extra mile for her patients and their babies.

Alexia, 36, from Palmers Green, in North London was referred to Miss Al-Habib after she and her husband Kyriacos, a window cleaner, spent five years trying to conceive.

As she explains: ‘I’d spent eight months on hormone treatment being monitored by nurses who wouldn’t even look me in the face.

‘When I met Miss Al-Habib, I just burst into tears. She just looked at me and said, “From this moment on, you are dealing with me personally. You will have a baby as soon as possible.” She gave me her mobile number, and she always answered any query — happily calling me back at weekends.

‘She tested my hormone and blood levels personally and frequently, and this extra attention to even the slightest change in my levels paid off. Nine months later, I became pregnant with twins.’

Alexia had undergone IUI (intrauterine insemination) where the sperm is placed directly into the uterus during ovulation — and the timing is crucial.

‘When I went into labour in May 2011, Miss Al-Habib came to see me at 8.30 in the morning,’ says Alexia. ‘She returned at 8pm that evening, and I asked: “When do you finish work?”. She’d finished nearly four hours earlier, but said, “I’ve worked hard for these babies and I’m going to deliver them myself — I can’t miss this.”’

Nearly two hours after that she delivered twins Chris and George.

‘Her total dedication goes far beyond anything I’ve ever seen before with any other doctor,’ says Alexia.

For Funke and Charles, there’s no doubt that Miss Al-Habib was key to them finally becoming a family. Jeremiah is now six and Funke went on to have another little boy, Issiah, now three.

‘We were so desperate to become parents, and meeting Miss Al-Habib was like having a friend who shared the same dream for us.’

Issiah was born on March 31, 2011 — ‘and although Miss Al-Habib was working miles away at another hospital that day, she came back to see him the next day,’ says Funke. ‘I said: “It’s thanks to you I have these two boys.” ’

Miss Al-Habib sends me texts at Christmas and on my birthday. When it was her birthday, I took the boys into the hospital to see her, and she cried with joy.

‘I always dreamed of hearing a little voice call me “Mummy”, and thanks to this wonderful doctor, that dream has come true.’

For Funke and Alexia, Miss Al-Habib is a more than worthy nominee for the Daily Mail Health Hero awards. But like so many of our nominees, Miss Al-Habib is modest about her efforts.

Asked about going to see Funke after Jeremiah’s birth, she says: ‘I had looked after this wonderful lady all through her journey to becoming a mother, so how could I fail to turn up to share her happiness?

‘I had dreamed of the day she would hold her baby in her arms, and it didn’t matter that it was Christmas Day. I wanted to be there to hug Funke and Charles and to see that happiness in their eyes.

‘It is far more than a job to me —it is a passion. You are starting a new chapter of life with amazing women, and many of them you will never forget.‘It’s not about being a good doctor — it’s about being a good person.’
