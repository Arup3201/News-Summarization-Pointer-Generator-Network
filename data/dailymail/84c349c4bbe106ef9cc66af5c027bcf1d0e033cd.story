Recluse: Dr Henry Singman's medical notes provide a fascinating insight into the later life of heiress Huguette Clark, pictured aged 24

The head of the hospital where reclusive heiress Huguette Clark spent the last 20 years of her life said that it wasn't his job to ask questions about why the elderly woman continued to stay in the facility for such a long period of time.

Now, as Clark's family brings the battle of the former socialite's nearly half-billion fortune to court, Dr. Robert Newman has testified that he repeatedly asked for large gifts from the copper heiress but didn't feel it was his place to inquire about her health or her reasons for staying in the hospital instead of returning to her massive Fifth Avenue apartment.

He 'testified that while he found it unusual that Huguette refused to leave Beth Israel since she was first admitted, and knew that she never left her hospital room, he did nothing to find out why,' court documents submitted by the Clark relatives reveal.

Instead, he referred to her as 'the biggest bucks-contributing potential we've ever had'.

At the time of her death, the 104-year-old Clark was worth an estimated $400million, but her relatives argue now that said fortune was frequently mined for gifts by her care givers and Beth Israel Medical Center, where she first moved into in 1991 and remained until her death in 2011.

'The record reveals a pattern at Beth Israel of soliciting gifts from Huguette almost immediately after she entered the hospital in 1991 while ignoring its undeniable duty to evaluate Huguette’s psychiatric condition, provide her with any psychiatric care and establish a plan for her discharge,' court documents discovered by The New York Post reveal.

In a 2005 email, published by the newspaper, Newman, who is a board member and former CEO of the facility, wrote: 'Madame as you know is the biggest bucks contributing potential we've ever had - but/and without knocking her past gifts, the potential has been overwhelming(ly) unrealized :-)'

Her relatives are accusing the hospital where the wealthy heiress spent her later life of rinsing her fortune to the tune of more than $13million in fees, donations and even a priceless painting.

As the court case continues, more details emerge about her condition and reclusive lifestyle that was all but a mystery ever since she disappeared off the Manhattan social scene largely after her mid-twenties.

According to The New York Post, Dr Henry Singman describes his first, 'most strange' encounter with the daughter of industrialist and senator William Clark in his musings.

At a friend's urging, Singman visited her 10-room, 5,000-square-foot New York City apartment in 1991 only to find that she was elderly, emaciated and 'looking like an advanced leper patient' due to skin cancer.

Her 75 pound frame was clothed in an old, soiled bathrobe and she appeared to be 'nearly at death's door,' according to newly published medical notes that give a fascinating account of the notoriously reclusive woman's final years.

Then 85-years-old, Singman said Clark 
was like 'an apparition' when he found her living in just one room of 
the lavish 907 Fifth Avenue apartment - one of three the millionaire 
owned - using a single candle for light.  

She
held a towel over her mouth to hide her partially missing lower lip and
ulcers had eaten away at the lid of her right eye and cheek.

During the visit, he coaxed her out into the light, persuading her to move to the nearby Beth Israel Medical Center.

After a few months at the Upper East Side hospital, the heiress was well enough to return home.

She had gained weight and surgeries had improved her appearance and helped her cancer.

But she never re-emerged from the facility, and, according to The Post, she never said why.

Singman
claims Clark hinted at her reason for remaining locked in dismal 
hospital rooms with the shades drawn and the door shut when she read him
a poem about a cricket and a butterfly.

'The
upshot of it was she wanted to remain a cricket rather than to be this 
beautiful butterfly that was flying around, because it was basically 
safer for her and she felt more secure,' Singman wrote in his account.

Singman
continued to care for the woman while she was at the $800-a-day 
hospital and he received monthly payments totaling $521,025 between 1997
and 2011.

He taught the 
woman solitaire 'and she learned every game in the book, improvising and
inventing new games. She has a 'steel trap' memory,' he wrote, 'but 
remains shy and reticent.'

Clark paid his malpractice insurance premiums also left the doctor $100,000 in her will, which is now being disputed.

But
according to the Post, Beth Israel hospital made the most out of 
Clark's impressive wealth, milking her for more than $13million in fees,
donations and even a Manet painting during her 20-year stay.

And
bosses at the medical centre wanted even more, trying to squeeze a 
whopping $125million out of the heiress to keep the hospital's outpost 
alive, her relatives claim in court documents.
