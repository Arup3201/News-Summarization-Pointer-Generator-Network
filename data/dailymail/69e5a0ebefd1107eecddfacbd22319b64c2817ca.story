It may only travel at 4mph, but this limo-bility scooter has enough luxuries to satisfy even the most demanding passengers.

The 'Limobilizer' is the world's longest mobility scooter and comes complete with its own CD player, drinks mixer and disco lights.

At 10ft long, there is enough room for two passengers to sit back enjoy a drink from the optics, while a driver operates the machine in comfort.Â 

Luxury: The stretch mobility scooter, which is 2.9 metres long, has its own mini bar

The machine was built by business partners Nigel Fitzgerald and Anwar Watson, who run Orchard Mobility in Taunton, Somerset.

The design entered the Guinness Book of Records as the world's longest mobility scooter after complying with regulations, which required them to drive 100 metres in two directions with passengers on-board.

Mr Fitzgerald said: 'One of the managing directors of a company we work with was retiring so we decided to make it for him.

Choice: Passengers can chose to put a range of drinks in the optics, including white wine

'We made it from an old scooter and stretched it, fitted two more seats and a drinks mixer. It also has neon lights and a CD player.

'It is great fun and really grabs the attention of people who come into the shop or see it at trade shows. It is something different.

'The Limomobiliser is certainly not something you see every day and makes people smile when they see it.'

Despite the accessories, the one-off machine is not for sale and cost just a few hundred pounds in materials to convert from a standard machine.

The company also boast a mobility camper van, a replica mobility beetle and police mobility scooter in their range of designs.

Spacious: The scooter can accommodate two passengers and a driver

Speed: The machine can travel at a measly 4mph, but has the accessories to make the slow trip a luxurious one

Range: The company have also designed a camper-mobility van a mobility beetle and a police scooter

Colour: The designs are displayed in the company's show room and are there to impress potential customers
