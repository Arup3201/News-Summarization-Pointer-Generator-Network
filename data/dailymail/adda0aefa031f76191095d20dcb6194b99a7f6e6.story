A middle-class couple who took to sleeping at Heathrow airport after losing their home have said they are ‘horrified’ by accusations they made up their story for money.

The couple were delighted to learn an online donations page had been set up in their name by a stranger, the total of which now stands at £9,300.

Hundreds of people contributed to the Go Fund Me page after reading of how Alan Lane, 71, and Katrina Smith had been forced to move out of their home in Poole, Dorset, after a string of poor financial decisions and bad luck left their savings and income chewed up by debt. 

Alan Lane and Katrina Smith have been inundated with offers of accommodation from kind-hearted strangers since sharing their story. The couple have been sleeping at Heathrow Airport after losing their home 18 months ago

With Mr Lane's adult children living 3,000 miles away in Canada, they have remained in the UK in the hope their luck would change.

But for the past four months they have spent five nights a week in the airport. 

Miss Smith said she and Mr Lane were ‘horrified’ by one accusation in particular which alleged they were running a bed and breakfast in Staines, Surrey.

The 62-year-old said: ‘It’s absolutely not true, of course it’s not.

‘We’re not running a B&B, we stay in one sometimes and it costs £50 a night.’

Miss Smith added: ‘We haven’t asked for anything but people have been so kind. Of course we wouldn’t have lied about this. If only they could be in my shoes to know.’

Since sharing their story in Saturday’s Daily Mail, hundreds of people from across the UK and abroad have come forward to offer assistance.

Within hours of their story being shared online, the couple received more than £9,000 in donations from kind strangers across the world via a Go Fund Me page set up in their name

Miss Smith was moved to tears by the kindness of people offering their homes, while Mr Lane described their generosity as 'amazing'. Among the well-wishers to have offered to take them in is Christopher and Julie Nairn (right) who live in the New Forest 

The fundraising page was set up by mother-of-one Natalie Longford. Miss Longford, who does not know the couple, wrote: ‘Let’s help them raise some money to get a deposit on a flat and turn their life around for the better.’

Less than 24 hours later, £9,270 had been raised by other generous readers touched by the couple’s story.

The fund was closed to new donations at that amount last night, with Miss Longford posting: 'I do feel that far more money was raised than anticipated and that should be more than enough to help anyone get on their feet.'

The couple have also been inundated with offers of places to live and are due to stay for free in a self-contained flat in the New Forest for a month.

The flat is owned by Julie Nairn, 63, a volunteer who works with the elderly and lonely, who said she felt obliged to help the pair, as their situation ‘could happen to anyone’.

A single foster carer who lives near Heathrow in Southall, also said they could stay in her spare bedroom ‘for as long as they need’.

The couple were living in Poole, Dorset, before becoming overwhelmed by debt. Neither has signed on to benefits, but their monthly income is not enough to allow for rent and loan repayment

The couple were forced to move out of their home in Dorset (above). They now spend some nights in the airport and others at a B&B nearby, foregoing meals to afford the room and access to a washing machine

Miss Smith said: ‘We’re trying to get our heads around it. People in this country are just great.

‘It’s amazing and totally renews faith in the human spirit.’

She said she was moved to tears by the kindness of people offering their homes, while Mr Lane described their generosity as ‘amazing’.

The couple, who have been together 28 years, had to sell their home in Poole, Dorset, 18 months ago.

They have been living hand-to-mouth since, at first staying with friends and family, but when the offers dried up, they began spending nights in Heathrow’s different terminals.

They do have a limited income, but say it is not enough to cover their debts, rent and the cost of keeping their belongings in storage.

During the day they spend hours searching the internet for work in free Wifi zones.  

While Heathrow has a group of dedicated social workers offering support to people found sleeping rough in its terminals, no one from the team has approached the couple.
