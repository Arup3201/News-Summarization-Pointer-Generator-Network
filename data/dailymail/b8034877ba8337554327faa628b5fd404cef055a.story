Straddling a powerful motorbike in his leathers, this is the first picture of the ex-Hungarian policeman named as a suspect in the brutal murder of a former British model and friend of John Lennon at the remote animal sanctuary she ran.

The family of Eva Rhodes gave the name of officer Zoltan Peter Horvath to her London inquest – claiming he had threatened to have her ‘eliminated’ – and told how he had once attacked the animal lover before beating her daughter so badly she feared she would die.

But on Sunday the shaven-headed 47-year-old former officer dismissed the dead Briton’s family and their allegations, declaring : ‘Eva’s sister is just a mean b****, so is her daughter.’

Horvath, pictured, denies murdering Eva Rhodes at the remote animal 
sanctuary she ran in Gyor, north-west Hungary, despite claims from her 
family

In chilling evidence to Westminster Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox, members of Rhodes’s family alleged they believed Horvath was linked to both the death of the 65-year-old and an extensive cover-up of the killing at the sanctuary in Gyor, north-west Hungary, where her body was dismembered and set ablaze in September 2008.

Speaking for the first time yesterday, there was only contempt from Horvath for Mrs Rhodes and her family, mocking them by suggesting the sanctuary – partly funded by donations from the UK and money given by Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono – had been used to run drugs and guns hidden inside dogs.

‘Of course I didn’t kill her,’ he said dismissively. ‘I was representing the law.  I cannot be linked to her death.

‘The only reason this case hasn’t died off yet is because she was English.’

He pointed out that Csaba Augusztinyi, 33, who worked at the sanctuary, had confessed and been sentenced to 13 years behind bars for the killing.

Recording a verdict of unlawful killing, Dr Wilcox had said that while she was satisfied Augusztinyi was ‘at least partly responsible’, inconsistencies in evidence supported the belief that ‘others might have been involved’.

This belief is strongly held by Rhodes’s sister Judith Majlath – a Nobel peace prize winner ¬– and daughter Sophia Barta.

The family has called on Scotland Yard to be allowed to investigate the death after the inquest heard of a disturbing conflict in the evidence of investigators  opening the way for Horvath to be potentially questioned by British officers.

Horvath insisted: ‘I’m also sure that when the authorities want to hear my side of the story I will be properly notified. But until then I cannot take these accusations seriously.’

The inquest was told that Horvath had never been questioned about the killing and had even taken part in the police investigation.

But he stressed: ‘I have been questioned about this Eva Rhodes case so many times and I have had enough of it. I just want to leave it behind me.’

He accused Mrs Rhodes of using her animal sanctuary as a cover to ‘smuggle drugs and guns’ into Hungary from Austria.

Friendship: Eva Rhodes became friends John Lennon and Yoko Ono, whose cash eventually helped pay for her animal sanctuary

Beauty: Ms Rhodes was a successful model and actress before moving to Hungary to look after animals

He claimed: ‘I filed reports about Eva’s suspicious activities but my superiors did not let me investigate properly.

‘She was collecting large dogs from the west to rehabilitate them after they were neutered, she claimed, but there was no rehabilitation.

‘Instead she burned the dogs at dawn.

‘How mysterious, they always ended up dying. I was never allowed to investigate.

‘What was she hiding inside the dogs – drugs, guns?’

He said Mrs Rhodes had refused to let him search her car.

The cats and dogs sanctuary was funded partly by donations from animal lovers in England and a gift from Yoko Ono

Horrific crime: Ms Rhodes was murdered at her animal sanctuary in September 2008 near Gyor, 65-miles from Budapest. Her body was dismembered and burnt

‘I stopped Eva in the middle of the night on a back road. She had been driving without her headlights on. She was clearly drunk. There were empty champagne bottles in the car and some big dogs with her.

‘I wanted to see the dogs, whether they were alive, but instead of opening the car, she just drove off.

I had to jump out of the way so I wasn’t run over. Again, I was not allowed to investigate.

‘I’m sure there is a whole lot more to this story than what has been made public. But I do not want to get involved with the case ever again.’

Horvath left the police when investigations into the death were on-going – the family claim he was ‘pensioned off’ – and he went to live in Bony, a dust-blown country village off the main truck road to Vienna, near the town of Gyor.

Following the break-up of his marriage, he moved to neighbouring Slovakia where he set up home with his girlfriend in one of the many Hungarian-speaking villages on the north side of the river Danube. The pair worked together in a hotel.

While he was happy to taunt those closest to Mrs Rhodes, he said nothing about his attack on the grandmother and Ms Barta – or the court ruling against him and legal wrangling that was on-going at the time of the murder in connection with the assaults.

Ms Barta, from Chelsea, west London, told the inquest how the policeman had been responsible for a ‘Rambo’ style attack on her and her mother at the sanctuary in 2002.

Crime: Caretaker Csaba Augusztinyi admitted killing Mrs Rhodes and setting 
fire to her body, but her daughter Judith Majlath believes that the Hungarian
 authorities covered up the investigation to protect a local officer

A dispute over a rescue dog had grown, she said, so that at one point the officer had attacked her mother in the courtyard and then turned on Ms Barta when she tried to photograph the assault.

She said her head was ‘smashed’ against the wall and Horvath then hit her repeatedly with his baton.

'I crumpled into a heap and he began raining blows on me with his baton - an American baton designed to break bones,’ she said.

'I turned my head and looked at his face and his eyes were that of somebody taking great pleasure in what he was doing.

‘I thought I was going to die.’

Eventually, Mrs Rhodes calmed him, she recalled, but not before he had ‘crushed like a pancake’ a grey kitten with his foot that had been beside her head.’

It was this incident and his subsequent ‘humiliation’ in court, the family believes, that lead to an on-going feud which ended in death.

Last night a furious Ms Majlath hit back at Horvath calling his comments ‘cruel and outrageous.’

‘It shows the quality of this man that he would say such things about the dead, about a woman who was murdered, butchered and burned on his patch, the very patch he was meant to police.

‘Like others in authority in Hungary, he has questions to answer – he had damned himself, what more does he need to do to the memory of a dead woman, whose only crime was to love animals and be prepared to stand-up to him?

‘With the evidence of the inquest and now these words, surely Hungary and Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who was in London last week given a speech on European Traditional Values, can’t continue to refuse Scotland Yard and Foreign Secretary William Hague’s call for all documents relating to the case to be handed over to Britain.’

She added: ‘Scotland Yard must be called in.  The longer they delay, the more people will ask what Hungary is hiding.’

Mrs Rhodes, attracted the attention and friendship of John Lennon and Yoko Ono in the 1960s when the famous couple were looking to cast an actress in a film project.
