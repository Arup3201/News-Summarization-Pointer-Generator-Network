When Emma Witty died of a brain haemorrhage at 19, her family were determined that some good should come of the tragedy.

A year on, they have spoken of their pride after her organs helped to save six lives.

Miss Witty, a budding photographer who loved giving to charity, collapsed at her home in Leeds in June last year.

Her devastated family decided to allow her organs to be donated to patients in need of a transplant.

Emma Witty died aged 19 from a brain haemorrhage, but her organs have helped save the lives of six people

Miss Witty's mother Catherine Gregson said the thought that her daughter had helped saved so many lives gave her 'a lot of comfort'

Miss Witty’s heart was given to a young woman in her 20s. A man in his 50s received her pancreas and one of her kidneys, while her lungs and other kidney went to male patients in their 60s. 

Her liver benefited two patients, a man and a baby girl of one. Her corneas were also thought to be donated.

Miss Witty’s mother Catherine Gregson said: ‘While it is difficult, it does give me a lot of comfort to know she has helped save so many lives and that her eyes are out there still seeing and her heart is somewhere still beating.’

Mrs Gregson described the horror of discovering her daughter had suffered a brain haemorrhage.

‘I was staying at my mum’s as she had been poorly,’ she said. 

‘I kept phoning Emma as she told me she was going to be at home.’

At 2am, Mrs Gregson received a call saying her daughter was in hospital. ‘She came round and we all thought that she was going to be fine. She started to talk, although she was very confused.’

But within days Miss Witty’s condition started to deteriorate. She died on June 20.

Her boyfriend Oli Dobson said: ‘After she died I was at the hospital with Emma’s mum and dad, and the doctor asked if we thought Emma would want to donate her organs. Her mum and dad looked at me and asked what I thought. I said of course she would.

‘She would want to do what she could to help others. That’s the type of person she was.’
