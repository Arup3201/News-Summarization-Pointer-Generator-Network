A Malaysian MP has been slammed for tweeting 'Long live Hitler' after Germany's victory last night against Brazil.

Kinabatangan MP Datuk Bung Mokhtar Radin posted on the microblogging site via the Twitter handle @MyKinabatangan: 'WELL DONE..BRAVO...LONG LIVE HITLER.'

The tweet in the early hours of this morning went viral and internet users have condemned Bung for his reference to the Nazi dictator and demanded he issue an apology.

A Malaysian MP tweeted 'Long live Hitler' in a bizarre tweet after Germany's victory last night against Brazil

'I don't know what's wrong with people sometimes. Hitler is part of history and the German team fought like how he did,' said Kinabatangan MP Datuk Bung Mokhtar Radin

But in his subsequent tweets to his 21,000 followers, Bung, a self-professed fan of the team, seemed unrepentant.

He re-tweeted the abuse he received - when one user asked how he manged to get elected he replied 'coz I'm better than u', while he told another user to 'get lost.'

Today he insisited he was commending the German football national team for 'fighting like' Hitler in their 7-1 win against Brazil in the semi-finals of the World Cup.

'I don’t know what’s wrong with people sometimes. Hitler is part of history and the German team fought like how he did,' Bung told English news portal The Star Online.

The Sabah MP also insisted that his tweet was 'just for fun'.

'I think people nowadays should transform their mentality. Whatever I tweet, people hit me.

'They are not hitting me because of Hitler, but because I am Bung Moktar,' added the Umno supreme council member.

German laws forbid Nazi symbols, denial of the Holocaust and public expressions of support for Hitler.

And today Germany’s Ambassador to Malaysia said the comparison was 'unacceptable'.

In a statement emailed to The Malay Mail Online,
 Holger Michael said the embassy 'strongly rejects' the reference.

'While
 we appreciate the admiration for the German football team, we strongly 
reject the unacceptable allusion to the fascist regime of Adolf Hitler,'
 Michael said.

In his subsequent tweets to his 21,000 followers, Bung, a self-professed fan of the German team, seemed unrepentant

The Sabah MP also insisted that his tweet was 'just for fun'

In one tweet the MP told a user he as elected 'coz I'm better then u'

Today DAP
 chief Lim Guan Eng said Bung's comment was a slur to Germany rather 
than a compliment, and falls foul of the country’s denazification laws.

'Bung Moktar should know that if he was to say this in Germany, he could go to prison for supporting Nazism,' Lim said at a press conference.

The embassy declined to comment on the severity of the salute for Hitler, which can constitute a crime in Germany reported The Malay Mail Online.

But his comments continue to anger netiziens.

One user posted: 'I cannot brain how an MP can actually say "long live Hitler" in 2014. And in support of a German team so far off from Hitler's ideals.'

While another tweeted 'Stop with the hitler jokes and comments. it's not a thing to take lightly. it's a football game, nothing to do with Germany's past.'

Germany has laws to restrict neo-Nazi propaganda and Nazi symbols are banned.

Bung Mokhtar became an MP since 1999 and is no stranger to controversy - he has previously been  criticised for his insensitive statement on women, race and other issues.
