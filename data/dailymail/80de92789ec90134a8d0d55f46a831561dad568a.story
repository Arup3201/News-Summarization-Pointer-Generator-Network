Honey Boo Boo's family has sparked shock once again after the child reality star's sister appears to have been pictured feeding a one-month-old baby Mountain Dew.

New photographs show 12-year-old Lauryn Thompson, aka Pumpkin, apparently dipping a pacifier into a can of Mountain Dew, before allowing her newborn niece, Kaitlyn, to suckle on it.

Of course, the soft drink is highly caffeinated, and can be dangerous for children to consume, let alone babies.

The shocking images of the family, from 
McIntyre, Georgia, the stars of Toddlers & Tiaras spin-off show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, were taken at the local Sparkle & Shine Pageant 
this weekend, according to RadarOnline.com.

Baby Kaitlyn is the daughter of Anna 'Chickadee', 17, the eldest sister of Honey Boo Boo, six, whose real name is Alana.

Alana herself shot to fame early this year under similar controversial circumstances, after her mother, June Shannon, 30, was seen giving her a mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull on an episode of Toddlers & Tiaras.

Ms Shannon, who was accused of 'doping' the child with high-sugar snacks and the caffeinated drink she called 'Go-Go- Juice', defended her actions saying: 'There are far worse things. I could be giving her alcohol.'

But child health experts voiced 
their concern about the so-called 'Go-Go Juice', given that a single can
of Mountain Dew or Red Bull contains as much caffeine as a cup of 
coffee.

A report last year from the American Academy of Pediatrics stated that children who have too much caffeine are at raised risk of neurological and 
cardiovascular problems. 

Its
authors warned: 'Energy drinks are never appropriate for children or 
adolescents. In general, caffeine-containing beverages, including soda, 
should be avoided.'

Child nutrition expert Melissa Halas-Liang told MailOnline that the first six months of life should be exclusively breast milk or 
formula.

Discussing today's photographs featuring Pumpkin feeding baby Kaitlyn Mountain Dew, she commented: 'I hope that the media attention that the Thompson family 
receives over this incident can be used as teaching opportunity for the
family on what constitutes good health and nutrition practices.

'It 
would be helpful for the family to ask questions about what and when 
it's safe to introduce foods or liquids of any other kind outside of 
breast milk or formula into their diet and the rationale behind it.'

Controversy: The parents of pageant star Honey Boo Boo (front) were accused of child abuse according to new reports. June (behind the youngster) and Mike (to the right) and her three sisters, are shown

The new photographs of Pumpkin and baby Kaitlyn have been made public less 
than a week after reports that the young pageant queen's parents were 
accused of child abuse.

The family was visited by the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services in March, according to The National Enquirer.

A source told the magazine that  investigators were
called to the home as a result of Ms Shannon and Mike Thompson's unorthodox, 
and highly-publicised, parenting methods which include feeding Alana 
caffeinated drinks as well as roadkill for dinner.

They claim the authorities who made the unannounced 
visit 'found reason to bring the case to court' but a 'court-appointed 
attorney' for Ms Shannon convinced the judge
to 'throw it [the case] out'.

Crazy: Once she had consumed the Juice, she was seen spinning around on the floor, her energy heightened

Ms Shannon has stolen much of the 
limelight away from her daughter in Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, which 
attracted 2.2million viewers when it premiered on TLC on August 8.

During the debut episode, she was seen grinding up against a young man as her daughter played in a giant mud pit.

She
has also been filmed taking her family to the supermarket to help her 
shop using discount coupons and taking Alana to their local food auction, 
June's favourite weekly activity, in order to bid on what appeared to be
sugary donuts.

She has 
also admitted that she is obsessed with 'couponing', calling it 'better
than sex'.
