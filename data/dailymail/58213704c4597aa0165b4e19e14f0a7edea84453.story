The 'poshest playhouse in Britain' which is fully furnished and comes complete with a thatched roof has gone on sale for £6,500.

The wooden Wendy house is spread over two floors and has an upstairs bedroom with two beds as well as a downstairs sitting room.

The thatched cottage, which is 11ft 6ins wide and 8ft 4ins high, can even be connected to mains electricity and water.

Playhouse: Brian McDonough bought the cottage 11 years ago for his granddaughters but is now selling it because they are grown up

Inside: The cottage, which is on the market for £6,500, is spread over two levels

Bedroom: The Wendy house features an upstairs bedroom with two beds

Owner Brian McDonough, 69, bought the cottage 11 years ago for his two granddaughters to play in.

He said: 'I bought it from a couple who had it in their back garden for their grandkids. The woman’s ex-husband was a carpenter and had built it himself.

'It has got a proper little staircase with spindles and it is completely waterproof. It is really super.

'It is hidden away in our back garden but when we get visitors they always say how fantastic it is.'

Mr McDonough, who lives in Shrivenham, Oxfordshire, with wife Pamela, also 69, has just spent £2,500 re-thatching the cottage.

But he has decided to sell the playhouse because granddaughters Sophie, 20, and Olivia, 17 are now grown up.

Cosy: The house, which also has a downstairs living room, can even be connected to mains electricity and water

For sale: The estage agents selling the cottage have had to point out in the advert that the cottage is 'only suitable for small children as it has very restricted headroom'

He said: 'It is a beautiful little thing for someone who’s got a few bob to spare.

'I didn’t want to just put in on eBay because people would think it was just an ordinary little plastic Wendy house.

'Mind you, the agents have had one woman who thought it was a real house and couldn’t work out why it was so cheap.'

Up for grabs: The builder is selling the cottage through local estate agents Perry Bishops with the unusual property on the market for £6,500

The builder is selling the cottage through local estate agents Perry Bishops with the unusual property on the market for £6,500.

The estage agents have had to point out in the advert that the cottage is 'only suitable for small children as it has very restricted headroom, but it is possible for an adult to squeeze inside when crouched down'.

Anyone interested in buying the two-ton Wendy house will also need to hire a crane to remove it from the McDonough’s garden.

Faringdon-based Perry Bishops won’t profit from any sale, instead donating their normal fee to ‘Helen & Douglas Home’, a children’s hospice in nearby Oxford.

Sarah Benson, a director at the estate agency, said: 'It has got to be the perfect Christmas present for your children or grandchildren.

'The property was recently re-thatched and is owned by a builder so is ready to go.

'We have had one enquiry so far from a couple who asked why it was so cheap and if they could move in straight away.

'I had to tell them it was a home for little people but then they asked if they could stand up inside it.

'It has to be the cheapest house I have sold in 26 years and certainly one of the most unusual.'
