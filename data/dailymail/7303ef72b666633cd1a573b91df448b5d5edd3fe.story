Last month she flashed an italic A for Abbott tattoo on her back and it seems there are more hidden adornments on the Prime Minister's daughter's body.

Frances Abbott has cheekily admitting to having more than just one inking on her body telling Daily Mail Australia: 'I might [have more tattoos] but you won't be seeing them.'

Speaking at the Myer Autumn/Winter show in Melbourne on Thursday, the fashion graduate defended her father Tony - who faced rebel backbenchers' bid to call a leadership spill - adding: 'Of course it affects you but he's still doing a great job, which is that of our father.'

She went on: 'It always effects you when people you love are slammed in the media, it's not fun, but it's the nature of the beast... It's happened before and will happen again. 

'For him, it's how he gets back up from that that will be a measure of his character. We will always support him.'

The middle of Mr Abbott's three daughters, Frances, who works as an assistant buyer for the children's department in Myer, revealed the moment she got the A tattoo. 

She said: 'I got it when I was nineteen, on a night out with friends, mum and dad weren't for it, I said it was going to be small and pretty.

'I know my family name won't be carried on as my father didn't have any sons, so I thought I'm going to get it permanent on my back.' 

The brunette was not accompanied by her boyfriend Lindsay Smith, who also works for Myer, revealing he was having supper with his family.

Frances said that just like any daughter she constantly worries about him, despite living in another city they are always in touch

In 2013 she spoke to Who Magazine about the tattoo, explaining her father wasn't too happy about it at first.  

'I gave [mum and dad] a warning. I said, "I am getting one," and Dad said, "You are mutilating your body." Then I went and got it done and they thought it was pretty.'  

Earlier this month the garrulous brunette spoke candidly about her relationship with her father, admitting that just like any daughter she constantly worries about him,  despite living in another city they are always in touch.

She moved from Sydney to Melbourne to focus on her career and, of course,  her father is based in Canberra. 

‘My standard text message is: “You’re doing an amazing job.”’ And he’ll reply: “Thanks angel,”’ she explained to Daily Mail Australia.

She also added: ‘I’m always thinking about him, especially with everything that’s happened recently with terrorism.'

Last year Frances was embroiled in scandal when it was revealed that she received a scholarship for a university degree costing more than $60,000 from a long-time friend of the Prime Minister.

She accepted a 'chairman's scholarship' for her Bachelor of Design course from the Whitehouse Institute of Design, where Liberal supporter Les Taylor sits as chairman on the board of governors.

The fashion student studied at the Sydney institute from 2011 to December 2013 and received the award as a result of her 'application and art portfolio', a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said.

 Mr Abbott had not declared the scholarship on his pecuniary interest register, despite previously declaring other matters relating to his children such as trips, accommodation and tickets to sporting events.
