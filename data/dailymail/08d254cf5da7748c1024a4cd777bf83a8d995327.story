Mike Catt cupped a hand to his ear, as the choruses of Swing Low rang around a rapidly emptying Millennium Stadium. Here was something you don’t see every day. An English lap of honour in Cardiff. Thoroughly deserved, too.

If anything, the five-point winning margin flattered the hosts. England won the second half 13-0 and it could have been more. George Ford missed a kick; James Haskell ran into a post rather than over the line; a try by Dave Attwood was chalked off, debatably. Maybe, just maybe, 2015 will be a good year for the roses after all.

The months before a World Cup need landmark wins, moments that define a group of players, and a coach. In 2003, Sir Clive Woodward’s team won back to back in New Zealand and Australia. Stuart Lancaster will be hoping this is his equivalent. The right win at the right time; a point proven, and a marker laid down.

Wales and Australia are England’s World Cup group opponents and Lancaster is now on a four-game winning streak against those teams. There has been a lot of pessimism around English prospects at their home World Cup but, slowly, it is evaporating. This was an injury-depleted side with Wales at close to full-strength. After eight minutes the score was Wales 10 England 0. It would have been easy to tumble towards the debacle of 2012’s record defeat here.

Instead, England did not just rally, but dominated. They asked questions of Wales in the first half, and made definitive statements in the second. Joseph scored a quite outstanding try, dodging and squirming away from no less an opponent than George North to put down near to the posts.

Only the boot of Leigh Halfpenny kept Wales’s noses in front for so long. There were fine performances from Joseph, Ford, Mike Brown, Haskell and Ben Youngs — among others — the pack were magnificent and Lancaster’s substitutions worked. Billy Twelvetrees took the energy level up a notch at a vital time, Tom Youngs was imposing.

The reason moans about injuries are not tolerated from England is that Lancaster has the deepest talent pool this side of New Zealand. Wales could not have coped with losses at England’s level, but if anything Lancaster has a confusing number of options.

Indeed, it is hard to say what this means for England, when such an important result is achieved with players missing. How can Lancaster resist Courtney Lawes or Brad Barritt once fit, for instance? Yet, equally, how can he turn his back on the players who came through for him here? How can Tom Wood replace Haskell after this?

Lancaster has capped 66 players in his three years and events in Cardiff will only have added to selection conundrums rather than decided them, with so many names worthy of consideration. A coach will say these are nice problems, but a settled team is also to be envied.

Woodward knew his by now, while it would be close to impossible to predict how many of last night’s starting XV will reprise those roles when these teams meet in the World Cup.

Still, taking the positives — a dreadful refrain, but one that at last has some relevance — Lancaster’s England have shown they have strength in depth if misfortune strikes in the autumn. Short-term, there was euphoria. What could have been a sobering, even calamitous night given the perceived disparity between the teams instead may prove a turning point. 

The fear for English rugby was that this Six Nations competition could prove the worst possible preparation in World Cup year. With Wales and Ireland to play away and France the unknown quantity, the darkest speculation had England in fourth place and carrying that emotional baggage all the way to the World Cup.

Not now. If England can win in Cardiff, they can give it a go in Dublin, too. And confidence will grow from here, no doubt of that. Ford is not a kicker of Halfpenny’s consistency, but the 45-metre arrow that clinched the game is one to put in the bank. No, he doesn’t inspire the faith that makes Halfpenny such a favourite son in these parts, but he has time.

It was a triumph for Lancaster and his captain Chris Robshaw, too. Warren Gatland had deployed his usual repertoire of psychological tricks prior to the game — from creating a specious debate around the Millennium Stadium roof to having his coach Shaun Edwards accuse England of cheating with their running lines. Lancaster had been portrayed as his nice guy stooge.

Yet Lancaster won the battle of the roof, and Robshaw laid down the law in the tunnel. Refusing to be upstaged by Wales’s belated entrance, he took a little of the sting from the pre-match crescendo.

Lancaster isn’t a greatly extrovert or boisterous figure, but his delight here could not be disguised. He was hugging his coaches at the end, a broad smile across his face.

He was right about the roof, too. Gatland was moaning up until the minutes before the match in his TV interviews but rugby union isn’t badminton. It isn’t intended to be played in church halls or in benign, closed environments, shorn of variance and unpredictability. It is an outdoor game, exposed to the elements, and should remain that way wherever possible.

If an open roof puts a match in jeopardy, through snow or torrential rain, that is different; but on a night like this one, cold and clear, with a little bit of breeze — that constitutes perfect rugby weather and should be left to do what it does. Hell, even had it been Ryder-Cup-at-Celtic-Manor torrential, handling that is part of the sport, too.

So Cardiff saw a different side of England, at last — as far removed from the mauling of two years ago as could be considered possible. If all goes to plan, they will not need to visit Cardiff to win the World Cup later this year, but even if they did it would no longer be a trip filled with trepidation.

To beat Wales 21-6 at the Millennium Stadium over a period of 72 minutes stands as one of the most impressive performances of Lancaster’s three years in charge, and it comes at the right time, in the right place — and against the right opponents, too.
