The Philadelphia Eagles and the Indianapolis Colts opened the 2014 season in similar fashion. Both trailed at half-time due to a combination of lacklustre play and clinical offense from their respective opponents. 

The Eagles made history on Sunday by becoming the first team in NFL history to be trailing by 17 points at half-time, to come back and win by 17 or more. As for the Colts, they fell just short of a comeback against the Broncos, losing 31-24. 

It makes for an interesting match-up at the Lucas Oil Stadium on Monday night to end the week-two action.

The Philadelphia Eagles will be looking to build on their season-opening win against Jacksonville

Nick Foles showed his mental strength and leadership qualities during Sunday's 34-17 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. During the first half, Foles had three turnovers - one less than he had in the entire 2013 season. After overcoming his struggles, Foles inspired the team to a rousing comeback, finishing the day with 322 yards and three touchdowns.

LeSean McCoy once again looks primed for another outstanding season, after opening his 2014 season with 71 rushing yards and six receptions for 41 yards. 

McCoy played an integral part in moving the chains as he accounted for seven first downs. Wideout Jeremy Maclin returned to action after missing the entire 2013 season with a torn ACL. Maclin reeled in four of eleven targets for 97 yards and a touchdown.

Andrew Luck admitted Indianapolis made too many mistakes in their defeat by Denver

The Colts will look to expose the Eagles' fragile offensive line. Not only did they surrender five sacks on Sunday but they also find themselves without Evan Mathis and Allen Barbre for Monday night's game. 

But Indianapolis themselves have injury concerns. Robert Mathis is out for the entire season following an Achilles injury sustained during a private workout (suspended for the first four games). Linebacker Cam Johnson was placed on injured reserve on Tuesday, while Jerrell Freeman is struggling with a hamstring injury.

Colts quarterback Andrew Luck finds himself with a host of new targets. Both wide receiver Reggie Wayne and tight end Dwayne Allen returned to action following season-ending injuries last year. 

Hakeem Nicks was signed during the off-season via free agency and made an instant impact reeling in all five of his targets for 36 yards and a touchdown. TY Hilton is one to watch in Lucas Oil Stadium as he averaged 92.5 yards per game during 2013
