TLC's upcoming reality series Our Little Family chronicles the lives of a five-member family - all of whom are living with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism.

The show, which premieres on February 17, stars Dan and Michelle Hamill along with their son Jack, 5, and daughters, Cate and CeCe, 3. 

The series follows Dan and Michelle as they teach their children to overcome physical challenges and learn to adapt to the world around them as they become increasingly aware they they are different from other kids.

According to TLC, Dan and Michelle are 'proud little people who are thrilled their kids are just like them. But growing up in an average-sized world has its complications, and they know the road ahead is not going to be easy'. 

'Jack's my first child,' Michelle says in a preview for the series. 'He has such a great spirit and such a great self-esteem and you just don't want anyone to hurt your kids.'

Footage for the series shows the Hamill family going about their daily life and sees them celebrating the twins' third birthday, dressing up for Halloween, cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving, taking a vacation for Christmas, and also documents Dan and Michelle's seventh wedding anniversary.

The show's inaugural season will be 'full of real family obstacles' - including potty training, kindergarten and sibling arguments.

Achondroplasia, which each of the five family members suffers from, is an extremely rare form of dwarfism and is believed to only affect around one in 25,000 people. 

This is not TLC's first show starring a family living with dwarfism. The network's popular series Little People, Big World, which follows the Roloff family, premiered in 2006.

The show is currently in its eighth season, and its season seven finale garnered 2.3 million viewers.
