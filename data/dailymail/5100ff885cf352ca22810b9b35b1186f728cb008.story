The SETI scientists, at UC Berkeley, are now homing in on radio signals from worlds found by Nasa's Kepler telescope. They are already sifting through 'hits' - points of electromagnetic energy that look like potential transmissions from alien worlds

The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence has homed in its search for alien life on the few alien worlds we KNOW to exist - using data from Nasa's world-hunting Kepler telescope project.

The SETI scientists, at UC Berkeley, are now homing in on radio signals from worlds found by the telescope, and 'objects of interest' which might or might not be worlds.

They are already sifting through 'hits' - points of electromagnetic energy that look like potential transmissions from alien worlds.

Early this year, they will move their search on to the terabytes of signals from the Kepler radio telescope - and they already know what to look for.

'We've started searching our Kepler SETI observations and our analyses have generated a few 'hits,'' say the UC Berkeley scientists.

'But all are undoubtedly examples of terrestrial radio frequency interference.'

The scientists look to see if signals are 'duplicated' elsewhere in the sky - a clear sign that they are caused by interference.

So far, all the 'hits' that the scientists have unearthed have been 'false positives'.

But a 'real' transmission would not look that different. The scientists are hunting for signals of 'narrow' frequency - space phenomena tend to produce relatively 'broad' signals.

'Even though these signals are interference, detecting events with similar characteristics to what we expect from ET is a good indication that the first steps of our detection algorithms are working properly,' say the scientists.

Artist's concept of the Kepler-11 planetary system: 'We'll apply our algorithms to all our observations of Kepler planets,' say the UC Berkeley scientists. 'During the coming weeks, we'll be posting more of our results as we process the nearly 50 terabytes of data we collected in early 2011'

Having 'tested' their algorithms, the scientists now aim to sift through a huge amount of Kepler data.

'We'll apply our algorithms to all our observations of Kepler planets. During the coming weeks, we'll be posting more of our results as we process the nearly 50 terabytes of data we collected in early 2011.
