After two years of bad weather blighting the annual event, the recent hot weather means the Glorious Twelfth will truly live up to its name this year.

In Scotland, the grouse-shooting season could be one of the best for many years because of the recent warmth and sunshine, moorland managers have said.

The red grouse season gets under way with the Glorious Twelfth today, and the better weather this year than in the past few years means that grouse breeding in England has been more successful, the Moorland Association said.

Cold, wet conditions which were widespread last year in the washout summer meant grouse chicks got chilled and died, while the insects they rely on for food in their early days were in short supply.

But the weather has had some negative impacts again this year, with swathes of heather in places such as the North York Moors killed off by icy winds in March, leaving nothing for the grouse to eat and leading to lower numbers.

Some moorland managers have delayed the start of their shoots because the cold, late spring meant the birds have developed later.

Shooting could carry on later into the year as a result of the late start.

Moorland Association chairman Robert Benson said pre-season counts of grouse in England had been delayed by the heatwave, and results were now coming in that showed problems in some areas.

But he said: 'Generally, at long last, for the first time in the last few years, we've had a reasonable nesting and hatching period, with good chick survival.

'In odd places, for various reasons, it's not going to be quite as good as they thought.'

A good grouse season is 'massively important from an economic point of view' to the uplands, Mr Benson said. The Moorland Association estimates the £67 million English industry helps employ around 1,500 people.

Robert Rattray, of rural property and sporting let agents CKD Galbraith, said Scotland's prospects looked good.

'Although Scotland endured a cold and long winter, in recent weeks this has made way for sunshine and almost unprecedented warm weather.

'Careful assessment of grouse stocks is revealing potential for one of the best seasons for many years, with some unusually large broods being seen.

'Grouse shooting on average generates around £30 million for the Scottish economy but I would imagine figures this year will be much higher, with all the knock on benefits of seasonal employment in local communities.'

Mr Benson said people came to shoot red grouse from around the world, providing direct employment and knock-on benefits for hotels, restaurants, B&Bs and shops in upland areas where otherwise little would be going on except sheep farming.

In England, he said: 'Shooting creates 42,500 days of work a year. With the prospects of a better season ahead, associated spin-offs will be in excess of £15 million, essential earnings in these challenging economic times.'

He also said there were benefits to wildlife of moorland management, for example control of predators such as foxes and crows, which maintained conditions suitable for moorland nesting birds including lapwings and curlews.

But figures released in the past few days showed that no hen harriers managed to successfully nest in England, pushing the bird of prey to the brink of extinction in the country.

Hen harriers benefit from the control of predators such as foxes, which feed on the birds of prey as well as grouse, but they also prey on red grouse, bringing them into conflict with moorland managers and making them the target of illegal persecution.

Mr Benson said the breeding situation in England for hen harriers was 'very sad', and that the Moorland Association was working hard with moor owners and keepers to convince them that measures can be put in place to deal with the problem.

He said there was a need for organisations to work together to promote measures such as diversionary feeding of hen harriers which are rearing their chicks to reduce the amount of young grouse which are taken and killed by the birds of prey.

Joe Duckworth, chief executive of animal welfare charity the League Against Cruel Sports, said: 'The shooting industry claims that they 'protect' the moorlands, creating a haven for wildlife. What a joke.

'The grouse shooting season does nothing more than annihilate and harm wildlife.
