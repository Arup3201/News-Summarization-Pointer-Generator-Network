While England still have one warm-up game left against Honduras, Italy drew their final match  against minnows Luxembourg – who are 102 places below England in the FIFA World Rankings - on Wednesday.

And post-match, manager Cesare Prandelli and his players admitted that they are some way short of their best ahead of their opening game against England in Manaus on June 14.

Sportsmail looks at five ways that Roy Hodgson's side can find joy against the Italians:

1. They can’t defend at corners

Prandelli admitted that his side had to improve on ‘a few things’ and that one of those was a weakness at corners.

Luxembourg’s shock equaliser came as former-Sheffield United centre-back Maxime Chanot lost his marker to nod home in almost the last passage of play in Italy’s World Cup warm-up campaign.

Centre-back Giorgio Chiellini admitted: ‘We need to pay more attention at set-pieces. We were good for 50-60 minutes but after that we got a bit stretched and we lost our heads a bit.’

With Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka both scoring at dead ball opportunities against Peru last week, Roy Hodgson would be foolish not to focus on a typical English strength and Italian weakness.

2. They are running out of time to get it right

AC Milan right-back Mattia De Sciglio conceded that Italy’s new system ‘needs time to find its balance’ as well as a need to ‘improve in attack’ while Marco Verratti blamed the draw on being ‘the first game in which we tried a new plan’.

‘We’re working hard, but we know that when the World Cup comes around we’ll be ready,’ he added.

Unfortunately for the young pair, they don’t have a lot of time. There are 10 days until the Manaus showdown but Wednesday was Italy’s last game before then.

England, on the other hand, have another game to help them find their way – albeit without the suspended Raheem Sterling who had been touted as a potential starter.

3. They waste chances on goal

Another problem pointed out by De Sciglio was Italy’s profligacy in attack – claiming that they were the better side before being ‘caught with a sucker-punch’.

Prandelli singled out Mario Balotelli as the chief culprit, throwing away three good chances.

Wasteful: Mario Balotelli missed a host of chances against Luxembourg on Wednesday evening

‘Mario had two good opportunities in the first half, and had another chance when Cassano came on,’ he said. ‘We’ve missed a few chances tonight, and then conceded a goal from a corner.’

If England can wind-up and frustrate the Italian talisman – which isn’t usually too difficult – they might be able to provide a similar ‘sucker-punch’ to last night’s opponents.4. They rely too much on space out wide

Italy’s goal on Wednesday came from the right wing, and De Sciglio made it clear afterwards that exploiting the flanks was key to their new system.

Verratti added to his team-mate’s sentiments, saying: ‘The coach asked us to play between the lines, but it was not easy because Luxembourg firmly closed spaces.’

Glen Johnson and Leighton Baines will need to be at their best to stop the Azzurri wide-men but also ready to use their opponents’ new system to their advantage.

De Sciglio and Prandelli both mentioned the amount of space left out wide and England’s full-backs should be key to taking three points in Manaus.

5. They haven’t won since September

Wednesday represented Italy’s seventh consecutive game without a win, with the likes of Demark, Armenia, Nigeria and Ireland getting results against the Azzurri.

Plenty to ponder: Cesare Prandelli has much to work on before Italy's game with England on June 14

Along with Luxembourg, England are ranked above all of these sides – only Spain and Germany are better teams in the winless sequence.

And Chiellini’s assertion that Italy are not ‘great at friendlies, but fortunately seem to be okay when it gets serious’ doesn’t wash.

Prandelli said afterwards that he ‘didn’t see anything worrying’ from his side – but he is in denial, even later admitting that they were lacking flair. England should make it eight games without a win.
