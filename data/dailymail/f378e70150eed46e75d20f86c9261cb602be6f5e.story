Manchester United are 'waiting to see' what Victor Valdes' plans are as they continue the pursuit of the Spain goalkeeper, Juan Mata has revealed.

The club are pursuing a move for the former Barcelona stopper and he was seen attending Chelsea's visit to Old Trafford in October where United earned a last-gasp 1-1 draw.

Valdes has, however, been without a club since leaving Barca in June and it seems he is yet to decide where his future lies.

He missed the World Cup due to a serious knee injury but his Spain team-mate Mata says he has been training with United in a bid to get back to full fitness.

Mata told Spanish radio station COPE: 'I speak regularly with Víctor Valdés, he's training with us.

'We're waiting to see what his plans are.'
