The Church of England yesterday urged Lord Falconer to drop his assisted dying Bill in favour of a Royal Commission into the subject.

The unprecedented offer to  co-operate with a public inquiry will be seen as a softening of approach towards the issue, although the Church remains strongly opposed to assisted dying.

But the idea was immediately rejected by the Labour peer and former Lord Chancellor, whose Bill has its second reading on Friday.

It comes after former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey made a surprise U-turn on the issue, writing in yesterday’s Daily Mail that it would not be ‘un-Christian’  to legalise assisted suicide.

The Bishop of Carlisle, James Newcome, who speaks for the Church on health issues, admitted Lord Carey’s intervention had raised important questions.

He said: ‘Certainly our hope is that the Bill will be withdrawn, and that because this is such an important issue, it could be discussed at length by a Royal Commission.’

But Lord Falconer said: ‘It is an unwise suggestion because it will take a very long time.’
