Not out of the woods: Many people are entering retirement still carrying hefty debts.

One in eight retired Britons still have a mortgage to pay off, with an average loan burden of nearly £50,000, a report revealed yesterday.

It estimates around 1.6million over the age of 55 who have retired have a mortgage. Some owe more than £100,000, the study said.

The research into the over-55s who have stopped full-time work shatters the dream of retirement being a time of holidays, relaxation and time with grandchildren.

In fact, the report, from the pension experts MGM Advantage, estimates retired Britons have a total debt burden of more than £100billion.

It warned the rising tide of poor pensioners is ‘alarming’, and said many are too scared to talk about their debts which are a ‘taboo’ subject for many people of this generation.

Many have interest-only mortgages, a loan which allowed them to pay the interest but none of the actual loan, forcing many to sell their home when the loan matures.

Britain’s new regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, estimates 40,000 people a year over 65 will have this type of loan maturing between 2017 and 2032.

The lucky ones will be able to repay the mortgage lump sum that they borrowed decades ago.

Many of the unlucky ones will be forced to extend their mortgage and keep on paying a mortgage into their 70s, which means they may have to keep on working to find the money.

Andrew Tully, pensions technical director of MGM Advantage, said: ‘These figures are alarming.‘They show the pressure people face on a daily basis trying to balance the household budget.‘Although many people consider themselves retired, they are continuing to pay off their mortgage, some with quite substantial balances.

‘Dig a little deeper and many people are working part-time, sometimes through choice but often simply to make ends meet.

‘Talking about debt in retirement will be a taboo for many people who find themselves in this position.’

Yesterday the Office for National Statistics, which looked at older people who are 65 and over, said it estimates around 325,000 in this age group are repaying a loan, typically of £30,000.

More than one in ten described their monthly mortgage repayments as ‘a heavy burden.’ To add to the pressure on pensioners, a separate report reveals how the income that they get from their savings and investments has collapsed since the financial crisis began.

The average retired household received around £1,863 a year in 2007/08, compared to £1,207 today, according to the retirement income firm Key Retirement Solutions.

MGM Advantage warned around a third of ‘retirees’ also have other personal debts, with an average of around £7,000. It comes after one of Britain’s biggest debt charity warned last week of a ‘crisis’ among people over the age of 60 with record numbers facing insolvency.

Step Change said it dealt with a record number of people in this age group last year, and said the numbers had shot up nearly 40 per cent since the recession began.

The report reveals people aged 60 and over typically have larger debts than any other age group who contact the debt charity about their financial problems.

On average, their total debts are £23,000, while the average debts of a typical person contacting the debt charity are around £17,650.
