A girl who'd been playing football since she was in kindergarten arduously fought with a Catholic league to continue playing after they tried to ban her from the 'boys sport' on moral grounds. 

Now she and her mother are pushing back again along with thousands of supporters to force the league to allow girls to participate indefinitely. 

When then fifth grader Caroline Pla of Philadelphia was told she could no longer play on the team in 2013 she made headlines with a change.org petition that convinced the archbishop to overturn the no girls rule-with an exception.

Pla, now 13, was able to play her last season but the archbishop banned all girls from playing in the future citing safety and 'Catholic morality’ as concerns.  

Making waves:  Caroline Pla had been playing co-ed football since joining a flag football team in kindergarten and continued to fight the catholic league to let her play against boys

Caroline Pla and her mother Seal Pla created another change.org petition just last week demanding that all girls be able to play football if a sports coach sees fit.

So far they have 15,000 signatures in just one week.

'Preparation for Christian adulthood likewise involves the development and encouragement of appropriate, dignified and respectful forms of contact between male and female students. The [Arch]Diocese therefore believes that it is incompatible with its religious mission and with its effort to teach Gospel values to condone competitions between young men and women in sports that involve substantial and potentially immodest physical contact.'

Consequently, the [Arch]Diocese has adopted this policy prohibiting co-ed participation in the following sports: wrestling, tackle football and tackle rugby,' said the Catholic organization. 

Seal said that while her daughter was playing football, a traditionally male sport, she was bigger than some of the other boys on her team.

This petition comes at a time when 1,600 girls already play high school football across the country, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations.

'As they got older I noticed that they’re not going to put someone out there who isn’t capable of doing the job or getting hurt,' Seal Pla told Yahoo Sports.

'Moving forward the boys are just going to get bigger. It’s like any sport, you get weeded out after a while. But for CYO, from 5th-8th grade, she was bigger than a lot of the boys.'

Pla is not just bigger than the boys she's a big inspiration for other girl who hope to follow in her footsteps.

Another girls who dared to fight for their right to play is Shelby Osborne who the first female defensive back to sign a letter of intent to play college football.

Ashley Brown hired a lawyer to fight the CYO league's rule in 2004, but she was unsuccessful.

Now 11 years later the Pla family wants to make sure no girl will ever be turned down from playing football again.

'I'm just fighting for others. I feel like I have to be the voice that fights for the people,' she told ABC.
