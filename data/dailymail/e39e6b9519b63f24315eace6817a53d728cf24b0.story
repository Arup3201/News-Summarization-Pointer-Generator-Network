An 87-year-old grandmother has become an online sensation after discussing men, drinking and her glory days with her granddaughter.

The Philadelphia native has become an unlikely star after her granddaughter Alyssa Pagliaccetti posted videos of her online entitled 'Sh** Gram Says'.

The videos show the foul-mouthed pensioner giving life advice to her granddaughter, sharing drunken tales and stories of her outrageous past. 

The spunky grandmother, known as Gram, is the star of a series of Youtube videos: Sh** Gram Says

'Gram has always had a potty mouth, as well as a spunky attitude to accompany it,' Alyssa told MailOnline in an email. 

'As the years progressed and we became older, her potty mouth has definitely gotten more vulgar.'

In this particular video, posted on her YouTube channel, Gram takes on the topic of drinking and going for a night and is quickly offered a beer after rejecting a drink of Fireball whisky. 

The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-native is 87-years-old and a former cashier, who is now retired

After declaring that she hates beer, Gram takes a shot of whisky with her granddaughter on camera

'I don't even like beer. I can't stand the smell of it,' she replies, while flipping through a magazine. 'It's worse than horse p***, I think.'

However, she quickly adds: 'I like anything that's hot, baby.' 

Gram, Alyssa's maternal grandmother, lives with her family.

She then begins recounting tales of her own days going out on the town in South Philadelphia

She tells stories about doing the Jitterbug, declaring that every man 'wanted to dance with her'

She also leaves her granddaughter with some warnings about the men she may meet at nightclubs

The family sees her everyday and they often have dinner together, which is when the rants occur, according to Alyssa.

After declaring that she doesn't like shots, she winds up taking 'a big long shot' to celebrate New Year's Eve.

'I'm all fired up!' she exclaims afterward, before demonstrating what it means to become 'cock-eyed drunk.' 

'If I had balls, they'd be on the floor.' 

'I'm going out tonight boys,' she continues. 'I'm gonna get some.'

'Get f***ing drunk. Show my p****.' 

In the video, Gram also demonstrates exactly what it means to become 'cock-eyed drunk'

The foul-mouthed grandmother then begins to tell tales of her days doing the Jitterbug in nightclubs around South Philadelphia, as well as attempting to recount her alcohol-fueled arrests. 

When asked what she used to do, Gram replies: 'Everything. Dance on the bars. Jump from booth to booth.'  

Though she has limited mobility now, the spunky woman has never lost her sense of humour - and still likes to frequent the casino when she is able to get out.

'With nine grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren, Gram likes to say that this is her greatest accomplishment,' Alyssa adds.
