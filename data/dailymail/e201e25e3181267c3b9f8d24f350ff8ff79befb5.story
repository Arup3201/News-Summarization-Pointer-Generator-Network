A Western Australian woman got a special delivery when she gave birth to her baby girl at a Coles supermarket.

Agnes Achan, 35, went into labour at Perth's Lakes Shopping Centre where a stranger helped bring her fourth daughter and seventh child, Emily, into the world.

The Yangebup woman said she got a shock when she realised what was happening.

'I didn’t know I was going to give birth that day,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'When I started shopping I felt a little bit of pain starting but not much.

'Then I went to the counter and put things up the counter and it got worse.'

This was when Ms Achan knew she was going to labour and asked her friend to go to the bathroom with her.

'I told her I thought the baby was coming and she said "Are you sure?"' Ms Achan said with a laugh.

'I was like "Yes I’m not lying."'

With help from staff at Coles, the mother-of-seven gave birth to a healthy baby girl at 11.40am on the Tuesday.

'One of the women who worked there named Linda took me to the staff room and held my hand throughout the birth,' Ms Achan said.

'There was a woman at the shops who was a midwife named Ellen -  she didn’t know me and I didn’t know her - but she helped me give birth.

'Then the ambulance arrived...the birth didn’t take long, it only took about five minutes.'

Lakes Shopping Centre's Nick Magro said Emily's birth was an unusual situation to happen at the supermarket.

'We’re pretty happy to share the moment with [Ms Achan] and congratulations to her,' he said.

'It doesn’t happen every day.'
