Impressionist painting is most commonly associated with the banks of the River Seine in Paris or the haystack-studded fields of Normandy.

But according to a magazine advert this week, the famous art movement has a new home - Weymouth, Dorset.

The seaside town was mistakenly pictured in a Radio Times travel promotion this week, which showed a photo of local attraction, Bennetts Water Gardens, instead of the pond in Giverny, France where Claude Monet painted his famous water lilies.

The family-run centre on the south west coast looks very similar to the garden where Monet lived and worked and to which the Radio Times is advertising seven-day trips for £699 per person.

The image used to illustrate the trip being offered to readers shows a footbridge that crosses the main lily pond at Bennetts Water Gardens, a former clay pit which gets 20,000 visitors a year.

Though impressive, the number of tourists visiting the Dorset attraction is somewhat dwarfed by the 500,000 visitors a year who head to Monet's garden.

The pond in Giverny, along with the Japanse footbridge which spans it, were immortalised in a series of 18 paintings by the French impressionist over a 20-year period from 1899.

In 2008, one of the paintings sold for nearly £41 million at auction in London.

Bennetts decided to build a replica of Monet's Japanese bridge over its main lily pond in 1999 after an old one fell into a state of disrepair.

The green-painted walkway leads tourists to the attraction's gift shop. The cafe has also been renamed the Cafe Monet in honour of the famous artist.

The gardens at the  Dorset centre (above and below) are modelled on the famous impressionist paintings but Monet never visited the ex clay pit in south west England

James Bennett, the curator at Bennetts, said: 'We had a bridge over our main pond before but it needed replacing in 1999 which was the 100th anniversary of Monet's water lily series.

'We built a Japanese bridge to recreate Claude Monet's famous gardens. We get a lot of visitors here who have been to Giverny and they do make comparisons between the two. We also get lots of photographers taking pictures of the view.

'I have never been to Giverny, simply because the best time of the year to go is now when the lilies are out which is also our busiest time.

'I saw the photograph in the Radio Times and realised, without a doubt, that it is our lily pond in the picture.'

The curator of Bennetts said he was 'bemused' when he saw the picture of his workplace in the magazine

He added: 'We are a bit bemused by it but I suppose it is a bit of a compliment to us. We must be doing something right.

'We haven't yet told the Radio Times but they probably need to know that the picture they are using is a copy of Monet.'

A spokesman for the Radio Times said: 'The advertisement was produced by a third party company, who sourced the image from a picture library where it was labelled incorrectly.

'However, having studied the very small picture the similarity is indeed remarkable and our readers will be pleased to know they can experience Monet's garden in Weymouth as well as France.'

But it is actually a former clay pit and was never visited by Monet himself
