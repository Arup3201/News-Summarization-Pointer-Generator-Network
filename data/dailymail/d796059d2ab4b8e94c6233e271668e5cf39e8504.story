After a entire month of awards ceremonies, the stars are clearly reaching the bottom of their red carpet wardrobes. 

At last night's Brit Awards, the celebrities fell foul of a whole host of fashion fails, including head-to-toe red lace, bright pink vinyl and ice skater-style dresses.

And while many of the guests at the event at London's O2 such as Cara Delevingne added a rock edge to their wardrobe, others fell into the trap of overdressing.

At the Brit Awards, the celebrities fell foul of a whole host of fashion fails. Some stars like Rebecca Ferguson (left) overdressed for the event, while others like FKA Twigs (centre) opted for bizarre costumes that didn't quite work, and Ashley Roberts (right)

The BRITS are usually a safer event for singers, as they can dig into their smart-casual wardrobe to attend the ceremony, but clearly, stars like Rebecca Ferguson and Lianne La Havas didn't get the memo.

The pair looked incredibly over-dressed in comparison to their musical counterparts, with Rebecca's outfit possibly being better at home at a gala dinner than one of the music industries coolest nights of the year. 

Elsewhere, popstrels like Charli XCX made the faux pas of displaying too much side-boob - the star left onlookers gasping with the acreage of chest on display as she took her turn on the red carpet. 

The clothes weren't the only area to take a hit, many of the guests also got a bit too enthusiastic with the curling tongs, like Ms Ferguson, once again, and Fleur East.

And others simply did not dress up enough. Singer Jamelia was spotted wearing a white shirt with a black and white spotted skirt which would have been the perfect outfit had she been heading to the office. 

Read on to find out who made it on to FEMAIL's worst dressed BRITS list this year... 

Caroline Flack's shiny pink dress was like something out of a budget space age film and the skater shape of the frock did left us unexcited

Fleur East's dress was elegant, but her OTT curly Elvis do let her look down as the singer piled her hair on top of her head 

Rebecca Ferguson's head of curls and floor-length red lace number was too much when put together 

Charli XCX's dress left little to the imagination and had the added effect of appearing frumpy from the front  

Lianne La Havas swamped her petite frame with too many layers covering her white dress in an over-sized kimono

Singer Jamelia wore a skirt and white shirt combo that would have looked better in the office than on the red carpet 

Normally stylish FKA Twigs arrived in a bizarre outfit which featured a long dress with a bra detailed top over a pair of wide legged trousers

She might not be everyone's fashion cup of tea, but we think FKA Twigs looks amazing.

She's one of the most exciting performers to watch, and her style gets people talking too.

If you thought the musician's own off-duty fashion was edgy, her red carpet looks always knock the sartorial ball right out of the park. Yes we have a huge girl crush on her.

Here FKA is doing her thang of being totally badass as she dominates the BRITs red carpet in this dramatic Alexander McQueen creation. The bondage-esque top teamed with the intricate embellished skirt overlay make the look the perfect fusion of high fashion and down right risky.

We lusted after this ensemble during the spring 2015 shows, which means it isn't available to buy yet, but you can browse the current Alexander McQueen offerings at Neiman Marcus by clicking right.

Ashley Roberts looked like she had just arrived from the ice rink in her flouncy dress which was too short at the back
