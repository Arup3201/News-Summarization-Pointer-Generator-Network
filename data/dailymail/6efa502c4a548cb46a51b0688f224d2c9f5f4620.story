The Duke and Duchess could be welcoming their new baby as early as the end of April, marking the second anniversary of their marriage.

But the birth may also be as late as July or August, making the newest member of the royal family a summer baby.

The happy announcement that Kate is expecting has sparked immediate speculation about when the child will be born – and inevitably when he or she was conceived.

Speculation: Rumours abounded in September that the Duchess might have been expecting when the royal couple visited Singapore as part of an official tour and chinked glasses of iced water at a gala reception

Fond farewell: After a successful tour in mid-September, when the baby could have been conceived, the Duke and Duchess waved goodbye to the South Pacific

As St James' Palace have confirmed 
that Kate is not yet 12 weeks pregnant, she could not have been carrying
the baby during their now infamous holiday to the south of France, in 
which she was photographed topless by a private pool.

The sun-kissed break at Chateau
D’Autet, a luxury holiday chateau in Provence which is owned 
by Viscount Linley, the Queen’s nephew, was followed by a tour of Asia.

But royal sources do not believe 
that the future King or Queen was conceived in the searing heat of the 
Far East, during the tour to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

This is because Kate was said to have been taking 
anti-malarial tablets while on the tour, which is not advised during 
pregnancy, and so it is unlikely that she was trying to conceive there.

The baby could have been conceived any 
time after September 10 this year, and depending on the exact date, 
is likely to be born in May, June or July next year.

The timing of the tour in mid-September could well mean the baby, born third in line to the throne, was conceived somewhere exotic - although Mail Online understands that Kate was not pregnant during the couple's tour of South-East Asia and the South Pacific.

On September 11, Kate and Wills began the Diamond Jubilee tour, starting off in Singapore, where temperatures reached a steamy 36 degrees.

During the trip, the Duke revealed the couple's plans to start a family after being quizzed by a little boy.

The plucky youngster had asked how big a family the Prince would like. He answered without hesitation: 'Two'.

William had previously clear that he and
the Duchess, who are both 30, were keen to start a family soon. Many 
predicted that would come after the tour was over.

They were pictured in Singapore clinking their glasses topped with water at a British Gala Reception.

Their decision to have a dry night and forgo the champagne fueled speculation that the Duchess may be pregnant and has since been the subject of global fascination.

In Singapore the couple stayed in the Presidential Suite in the raffish Raffles Hotel, following in the footsteps of Joseph Conrad and Noel Coward.

The lavish suite at the hotel had a private balcony, high ceilings and valuable antiques.

On one of the hotter days, Kate was pictured wearing a pretty silk skirt and top by Asian designer Raoul, nipped in at the waist with a belt.

She also chose a floral print floaty dress for an evening event, which was loose fitted from the waist downwards.

During the nine-day trip, the couple also traveled to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, Borneo and the Solomon Islands, ending the tour  on the South Pacific realm of Tuvalu, the fourth smallest country in the world.

Kate and William spent a night on privately owned Tavanipupu island, famed for its crystal waters and luxury hand-thatched bungalows.

While the couple were on the tour, French Closer decided to publish topless photos of Kate of her sunbathing by a private pool in the south of France.

The pictures were taken a week previous to the tour, at 
Chateau D’Autet, a luxury holiday chateau in Provence.

The royal couple continued the tour despite the scandal emerging as other publications followed suit in releasing the photographs.

Following the trip, the couple have spent more time apart, with Kate attending solo engagements and William back at work as an RAF helicopter pilot.

But last month the couple attended a party at the exclusive London private members club Loulou's 
in Mayfair with other guests including the Duchess of Cambridge's sister
Pippa and the Duke's cousin Princess Eugenie.

They
are very rarely seen out together other than at an official event but 
the pair decided to let their hair down - leaving the club at around 
midnight.

It is not known whether Kate was drinking at the club, or whether she was pregnant at the time.

As Duchess is less than 12 weeks pregnant, the baby could have been conceived during Kate and William's tour of the Far East in mid-September
