The security consultant who told CBS that he was inside the American consulate during the attack in Benghazi has now gone into hiding over death threats.

60 Minutes aired a segment on November 2 based on the story that Dylan Davies told them- saying that he fought off a terrorist and saw the dead body of Ambassador Chris Stevens- that they were forced to retract after it was proved to be false.

Davies stood by his story even though it was not the same version of events he told both his employer and the FBI, but his book publisher has already stopped selling it in light of the findings that emerged last week.

Now Davies has gone into hiding and does not know when he will emerge.

In hiding: Dylan Davies told a story that has now been proved to be false during a 60 Minutes interview and has since received death threats against his family

The Daily Beast reports that on the same day that they decided to pull his book from the shelves, he sent an email to his publisher saying that he was sent a hand-delivered note to his home in Wales threatening his family.

Sunday November 2: 60 Minutes airs their segment where Lara Logan interviews Dylan Davies- then going by his pseudonym Morgan Jones

Monday November 3: Davies receives a hand-delivered note to his home in south Wales threatening his family

Friday November 8: Davies sends an email to his publisher saying he is going into hiding. Lara Logan makes an apology and retracts their story that morning. Simon & Schuster announces that they will be pulling his book.

He told Jennifer Robinson, the vice president of Simon & Schuster, that he received a note at 4am on November 3 that read: 'Stop talking now or your wife and son will disappear.'

'Due to this threat I will not discuss the book with anyone under any circumstances for the foreseeable future, I am not prepared to put my family in danger. I stand by my story however I understand that it continues to be rubbished, which I expected,' he wrote in the email.

The book, The Embassy House, had already been on sale online and an unknown number of people had already bought the book. Simon & Schuster announced Friday afternoon that 'in light of information that has been brought to our attention' they will no longer be selling it.

The Daily Beast reports that the local police chief confirmed that a threat is being investigated in connection to Mr Davies and his family.

Apology on Nov.8 : Lara Logan said that they were wrong to air her interview with a man called Dylan Davies who, it has since been revealed, lied about his role on the night of the attacks on the American mission to Benghazi

After the CBS segment originally aired, reporter Lara Logan was forced to make a public apology following further investigation because it became clear that there were discrepencies in his story.

Pulled: The publisher announced on Friday that it will stop selling Davies' book

The network initially stood by him- believing his claims that he was the subject of a slander attack by the State Department- but scrutiny by other news outlets proved too compelling for them not to launch their own investigation, and, eventually, admit their mistake.

‘The most important thing to every person at 60 Minutes is the truth, and today the truth is we made a mistake. That's very disappointing for any journalist, that's very disappointing for me,’ Logan said when she gave an on-air mea culpa during CBS This Morning.

‘Nobody likes to admit that they made a mistake, but if you do, you have to stand up and take responsibility and you have to say that you were wrong and in this case we were wrong.’

During the original interview, Davies- who went by the pseudonym that he used while writing a book about his version of events, Morgan Jones- said that he scaled a 12 foot wall and fought off a terrorist when he arrived at the consulate on the evening of the attack.

Placing the blame: While she repeatedly said 60 Minutes was taking responsibility, she said that they were 'misled' by Davies who did not tell them that he gave a different version of events to the FBI

Lies: Davies told 60 Minutes that he scaled a 12-foot wall to get into the compound and then fought a terrorist to the ground once he got inside. He also said he saw the dead body of the American ambassador

During the original interview, Davies- who went by the pseudonym that he used while writing a book about his version of events, Morgan Jones- said that he scaled a 12 foot wall and fought off a terrorist when he arrived at the consulate on the evening of the attack.

‘His boss is someone he cared about enormously. He cared about his American counterparts in the mission that night, and when his boss told him not to go, he couldn't stay back. So that was always part of the record for us,’ Logan said.

She made it clear that what they did not know was that Davies had given that account to the FBI in their incident report. His involvement with the FBI report came via The Washington Post after the 60 Minutes piece aired, and Logan said that when they confronted him over the claims, he denied it.

Logan said that they have since tried contacting Davies about the situation and they have not been able to get in touch with him.

‘We were misled and we were wrong and that's the important thing and that's what we have to say here: we have to set the record straight and take responsibility,’ she said.
