A man's body which was hidden under branches at a Melbourne beach on Tuesday morning is now part of a homicide investigation

Police say a woman who was walking her dog at 8.45am found the man face down in the bushes

It is believed the death is 'suspicious' and the branches were placed over the man's body in 'an attempt to conceal him'

'The deceased had a number of branches placed over him, in what looks like an attempt to conceal him,' Detective Sergeant Sol Solomon told reporters at the scene.

'Based upon our observations at this stage, we are treating this death as suspicious.

'This is now a homicide investigation.'

Det Sgt Solomon said four branches covered the man, who appeared to be aged in his mid to late 30s.

'He was still quite visible,' he said.

Locals were shocked to hear of a suspected murder in what's been described as a 'nice and quite neighbourhood', Nine News reports.

Police closed one kilometre of the beach in search for a weapon or any clues into the man's death.

There was no identification found with the man, who was fully clothed, and there were no obvious injuries.

Det Sgt Solomon said it appeared the man had been there since at least Monday.

It is unknown how the man died as police await post-mortem results.

Police are urging anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
