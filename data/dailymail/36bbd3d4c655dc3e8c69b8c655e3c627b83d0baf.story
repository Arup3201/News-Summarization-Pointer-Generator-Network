Blackburn could find themselves in hot water with the FA after a fan  threw a flare which landed near a group of Bolton fans during the Boxing Day derby.

The flashpoint took place during the second half of Blackburn's 2-1 defeat at the Macron Stadium.

Smoke can be seen billowing out from corporate box after flare was thrown during Boxing Day derby

A supporter appeared to throw a pyrotechnic which landed in a corporate box situated in the area of the ground which accommodated the visiting Bolton fans.

Police and stewards were quickly on the scene and it had looked as if it may boil over.

But order was quickly restored with smoke billowing from the corporate box.

The former Liverpool striker equalised 14 minutes after coming on before Darren Pratley netted the winner soon after.

Sportsmail contacted both Bolton and Blackburn but no-one was available for comment.
