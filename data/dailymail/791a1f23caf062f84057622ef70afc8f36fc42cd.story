A mother has been supplying police with information about her Muslim convert son, who travelled to Somalia in hope of becoming a suicide bomber.

Sally Evans took action because she fears that 24-year-old Thomas will kill innocent people after joining the Islamist Al Shabaab group behind atrocities in neighbouring Kenya.

The 56-year-old said she would rather see her son in a British prison than dying for his ‘warped ideology’ in a foreign country.

Thomas Evans, now known as Abdul Hakim, who has converted to Islam and is now fighting in Somalia after joining the terrorist group al-Shabaab

‘I did tell police what happened because I have nothing to hide,’ said Mrs Evans, of Wooburn Green in Buckinghamshire.

‘I
 would rather have Thomas alive behind bars than dead in the middle of 
nowhere because he wouldn’t just die innocently but die doing something 
that he shouldn’t be doing.

‘And if he took other lives, how do you live with this? If he was a suicide bomber, how would I live with that?’

In
 a phone conversation with her son that police were made aware of, Mrs 
Evans asked if he was thinking of becoming a suicide bomber. She told 
the Sunday Times he replied: ‘If asked, I would, Inshallah [God 
willing].’

About 50 British
 jihadists are believed to have gone to Somalia to join Al Shabaab. 
Hundreds have also travelled to Syria to take part in the civil war, 
prompting police to urge women to report male relatives planning to go 
abroad to become terrorists.

Mrs
 Evans told the Daily Mail that her son left school at 16 and had been a
 ‘normal’ boy until he became depressed after splitting with a long-term
 girlfriend and slipped into ‘troublemaking’.

Evans
 converted to Islam when he was 19 and adopted the Islamic name Abdul 
Hakim. His beliefs became increasingly fundamental after he started 
going to a small prayer centre.

Now
 with a beard and shaved head, he tried to convince his mother and 
younger brother Micheal to become Muslims, saying: ‘I want you to 
convert to Islam, otherwise you will burn in hell.’

Divorcee Mrs Evans said one of the few friends he brought to her house was Donald Stewart-Whyte.

Another
 convert, Stewart-Whyte was arrested in 2006 in connection with the 
liquid bomb plot to blow up planes but was later cleared of any 
involvement.

Evans attempted
 to fly to Kenya in February 2011 but was blocked by anti-terrorism 
police at Heathrow. A few months later he went to Egypt, saying he was 
planning to study Arabic.

Police
 later informed his mother he had been trying to enter Kenya. It wasn’t 
until January 2012 that he phoned and told her he was in Somalia and was
 prepared to die for his Islamist beliefs.

He
 said she wouldn’t see him again. In August that year he claimed he had 
been shot in the leg and treated at a ‘field hospital’.

Mrs
 Evans added: ‘I am heartbroken at his decision to leave me and his 
brother to follow a warped ideology but I still love him. I wish they 
had a magic wand to bring him back.’

The Metropolitan Police, who have oversight on counter-terrorism issues, declined to comment.
