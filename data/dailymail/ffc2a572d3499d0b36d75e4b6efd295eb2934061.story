USA have been given a boost ahead of their pivotal final Group G clash against Germany with news that Hollywood actor Will Ferrell has offered his services to replace injured striker Jozy Altidore.

The 46-year-old jokingly declared his availability for Thursday's fixture during an US fan event in Recife to the delight of the American supporters.

Hungry for success: Ferrell jokingly added he would happily bite every German player if he has too

The comic 
actor admitted he was not in 'soccer shape' but he would 'bite every 
German player' if he has to - in light of Uruguay striker Luis Suarez's 
antics towards Italy's Giorgio Chiellini - to the amusement of the listening fans.

Jurgen Klinsmann's USA team know a point against their opponents will seal qualification into the knockout stages of the World Cup.

USA were seconds away from reaching the knockout stages on Sunday before Portugal forward Silvestre Varela's dramatic equaliser in Sunday's 2-2 denied them.

Key striker Altidore is still not fit after suffering a hamstring injury against Ghana in their opening match but he could return for the USA if they reach the last 16.
