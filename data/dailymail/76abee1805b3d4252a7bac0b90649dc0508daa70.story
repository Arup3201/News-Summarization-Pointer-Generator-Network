Andrew Mitchell has made an official complaint over police leaks as they have run a 'dishonest and illicit' campaign to destroy him

The Cabinet Minister forced to step down over the ‘plebgate’ affair has accused police of a sustained ‘dishonest and illicit’ campaign to destroy him.

Former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell launched the attack after a press report suggested an official Scotland Yard inquiry has dismissed his claim that police lied about being insulted by him.

He accused Scotland Yard of leaking the information in an attempt to clear Downing Street police, who claimed he called them ‘f****** plebs.’

In a letter to Deborah Glass, deputy chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, he said: ‘I would like to lodge an official complaint to the IPCC.’ He added: ‘This was an enquiry into a dishonest and illicit attempt to blacken my name and destroy my career.

'It would appear that this police enquiry continues precisely that process. I am deeply dismayed that the Metropolitan Police appear to have leaked part of their report prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service .  .  . and spun it to the advantage of the police officers involved.’

Mr Mitchell’s response came after press reports that Scotland Yard’s inquiry into the row found no conclusive evidence that Downing Street police lied or tried to frame him. 

Mr Mitchell has apologised for using bad language when asked to take his bicycle via a side entrance at the Downing Street gates last September.

But he has always claimed that police fabricated claims that he called them ‘f****** plebs’. It led to his resignation as Chief Whip after it was leaked to the press. 

But the row flared again last week when the Metropolitan Police sent the results of a three-month investigation into the affair to the CPS.

The former Chief Whip has written to Deborah Glass, deputy chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. He argues that the police attempted to destroy his career

It is understood to conclude there is no proof of a conspiracy by the officers to smear or destroy Mr Mitchell’s career. 

The saga took another turn when, hours after receiving the Met’s file, the CPS said it was unhappy with the quality and quantity of the evidence. Weeks after being forced to resign in disgrace, Mr Mitchell became convinced that he was the  victim of a police conspiracy after new evidence appeared to cast doubt on the claims against him.

About 30 detectives have taken statements from all  800 officers in the diplomatic protection group as part of  Operation Alice, the codename for Scotland Yard’s ‘plebgate’ investigation.

However, it is understood that Operation Alice has found no evidence to corroborate  Sutton Coldfield MP Mr  Mitchell’s allegation.

He has always claimed that police fabricated claims that he called them 'f****** plebs' when he was asked to use a different entrance last year (pictured)

Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis, a close ally of Mr Mitchell, said last night: ‘It is not for members of the Metropolitan Police to decide on their own case, and it is certainly not for them to attempt to spin themselves out of trouble.’

Criticism: Keith Vaz said the Met police should not have investigated its own officers

Former Tory leader Michael Howard said: ‘I am concerned about the leaked report. 

‘It should not have put into the public domain. If leaked by the police – and there are indications that this is the case – it is utterly deplorable.’

Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, said the latest development showed it was wrong for Scotland Yard to lead the inquiry into its own officers.

He called for the whole investigation to be taken over by the IPCC.

Scotland Yard is trying to discover how two national newspapers obtained information about the 'Plebgate' row and if it came from police.

It is also looking at a police officer's claim to have witnessed the altercation and allegations by Mr Mitchell that police had lied in a log of the event.

Three officers from the Diplomatic Protection Group have so far been arrested as part of the investigation. All three remain suspended.

Papers related to the case were passed to prosecutors on Thursday, but the CPS said it was not 'a full file of evidence' and more is expected .

"We now await the conclusion of the police investigation before considering charges," it said in what was seen as a rebuke to the force.
