Harry Kane has been awarded the Barclays Premier League Player of the Month award for January after his impressive season continued with a blistering start to 2015.

The forward has scored five goals in all competitions, including a double against Chelsea during a 5-3 victory.

The 21-year-old is now being touted for an England call-up and has impressed the watching Roy Hodgson in recent months, who has now hinted Kane could be included in the next squad.

'Is he worth a place in the squad now? Of course he is,' said Hodgson.

Kane has helped propel Spurs into Champions League contention and bagged against Liverpool on Tuesday but couldn't help them gain three points. 

Having scored 23 goals this season and impressing throughout the busy Christmas period, it would have been hard to look at anyone else for the award.

Queen Park Rangers' Charlie Austin won the award in December and Kane has now made it two English winners in a row.  

This is the Spurs forward's first award as he beat a number of his rivals to the prestigious prize.

Oscar was another player in contention after his impressive month for Chelsea, which included three goals and two assists.

Dwight Gayle was nominated after he helped Alan Pardew settle into life at Crystal Palace with three goals - including a double against Burnley.

Makeshift centre back Emre Can of Liverpool also made the shortlist, with his solid performances helping his side to three clean sheets.

The in-form Santi Cazorla, who helped orchestrate Arsenal's win over Manchester City, and Jose Fonte of Southampton were also considered for the award.
