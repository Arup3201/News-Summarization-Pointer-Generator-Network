Great expectations: Luiz Felipe Scolari oversees Brazil training in Fortaleza on Monday

VIDEO Hulk a doubt for Brazil 

One to watch: Oscar

Brazil’s creator in chief was at his best against Croatia, scrapping in midfield, grabbing a goal and assist and playing a part in another goal. His tendency to drop deep makes him difficult to mark and his injury troubles in the second half of the season appear to have left him fresh to star for the Selecao.

Key clash: Fred vs Rafael Marquez

Fred took some criticism for the way he went down against Croatia and Marquez will need to be wary not to get too close to the Brazil frontman whilst also making sure he does not provide a platform for Neymar to star again coming in from the left. A difficult job but one the four-time World Cup captain will relish.
