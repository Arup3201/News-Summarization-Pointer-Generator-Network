A Russian ship has been stopped by the British government off the Scottish coast over fears that it is carrying helicopters and missiles to Syria - as Russia announced it was sending troops to the region.

The decision to halt the liner followed an intervention from the Government, who warned the ship’s insurers that covering the vessel could breach an EU arms embargo.

British marine insurer Standard Club has withdrawn cover from the fleet of Russian company Femco who own the ship.

Under EU sanctions, countries are banned from exporting arms to Syria and providing other services including insurance.

Halted: Russian ship Alaed has been stopped off the Scottish coast over fears that it is carrying helicopters and missiles to Syria

Cargo: It is believed the ship is carrying a number of Mi25 helicopters, similar to the one pictured above, which have played an increasing role in Assad¿s attacks against rebel-held towns

It is believed that British Government officials informed the insurers that if they continued to cover the ship, they could be in breach of the sanctions.

In a statement the company said: ‘We were made aware of the allegations that the Alaed was carrying munitions destined for Syria.

‘We have already informed the ship owner that their insurance cover ceased automatically in view of the nature of the voyage.’

The ship in question, the MV Alaed, has been the subject of an international row after US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton said the liner was carrying weapons destined for the Assad regime.

It is believed the ship is carrying a number of Mi25 helicopters, which have played an increasing role in Assad’s attacks against rebel-held towns.

The insurers’ move came as Russia - a key ally of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad - announced that it is preparing to send two warships and a team of elite marines to the war-torn country.

Tensions between Moscow and Washington that were already running high over Russia’s continuing support for President Bashar al-Assad’s embattled regime.

Criticised: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been accused of endangering peace in the Middle-East with his increasingly bloody crackdown on opponents

Russia said yesterday it was 
preparing to send marines to Syria in case it needed to protect its 
personnel and remove equipment from its giant naval base in the 
Mediterranean port of Tartous.

‘We
 must protect out citizens,’ Major General Vladimir Gradusov, a deputy 
Russian air force chief, was quoted as saying last night.

‘We won’t abandon the Russians and will evacuate them from the conflict zone if necessary,’ he added.

But
 some western analysts saw the planned deployment as a clear signal to 
the U.S. and its western allies that Moscow would not tolerate any 
foreign military intervention to end the bloody 15-month crackdown on 
rebel forces in Syria.

President
 Obama, sitting stony-faced with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the
 G20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, yesterday, insisted both leaders were 
working on a ‘political solution’ to stop the bloodshed.

No mention was made of the disagreements that have divided the two countries or on Russia’s warships plan.

But in what could be a sign of progress, they agreed the Syrian people should choose their own government.

In the joint statement, the leaders said: ‘In order to stop the bloodshed in Syria, we call for an immediate cessation of the violence and express full support for the efforts of the UN and Arab states joint special envoy Kofi Annan.

‘We are united in our belief that the Syrian people should have the opportunity to independently and democratically choose their own future.’
