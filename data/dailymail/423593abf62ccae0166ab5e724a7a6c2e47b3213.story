A three-year-old girl is warming hearts around the country with her decision to donate her long blonde tresses to a charity for children with alopecia.

Ariana Smith from Winterport, Maine, came up with the idea all by herself after she happened to see a video featuring a bald hospital-bound child, and learned that the girl had lost her hair because she was sick.

According to Ariana's father Josh, who posted photos of the haircut to Imgur over the weekend, the toddler, 'without a second thought', said: ‘Oh, well she can have some of my hair.'

Ariana came across the footage of the sick child when her father, who participates with an unrelated children's charity called Extra Life, was watching it, according to ABC News.

After expressing her desire to donate her hair to another child, the Smith family came across Locks of Love; a Florida-based nonprofit which provides 'hair prosthetics' to financially disadvantaged children.

Most of the children they serve have lost their hair due to alopecia, according to the charity, which causes the hair to fall out and has no known cause or cure.

The autoimmune disorder affects 4.5million U.S. children and adults alike, and is most likely to start in early life.

Getting ready: The Smith family then came across Locks of Love; a Florida-based nonprofit which provides 'hair prosthetics' to financially disadvantaged children, most of whom are suffering from alopecia

Big heart: Mr Smith describes his daughter's desire to help another girl 'feel pretty' as endearingly 'selfless'

All done! Ariana emerged from the salon with a chin-length bob and a big smile

A week after Ariana opted to support Locks of Love, she was taken to her family hairdresser for her very first haircut, and had ten inches cut from her long blonde tresses.

She emerged with a chin-length bob and a big smile. 

Mr Smith describes his daughter's desire to help another girl 'feel pretty' as endearingly 'selfless.'

'She is a typical little kid, but if she sees somebody in need, she certainly nurtures them,' he tells ABC.

'This made Ariana feel special and she’d definitely like to do it again.'
