Muslim clerics have issued fatwas banning everything from yoga to Valentines Day in Malaysia in a bid to stop the influence of Western culture.

While Malaysia is a bastion of Islam, many residents see themselves as both devout to their faith and cosmopolitan in their interests.

But as Malaysia becomes more modern in its thinking and culture its state-backed religious authorities are fighting to slow progress by issuing some 1,500-plus rulings.

Fatwas are guidelines, but police can enforce them under Malaysia's Sharia laws. 

To ensure Muslims can keep pace with the rules, an 'e-fatwa' site has been started the Globalpost reports.

Yoga -  it's Hindu origins can 'destroy the faith of a Muslim'.

Wagyu beef - the cows are occasionally fed beer which is forbidden.

Botox - unless medically necessary. 

Black metal - is said to be powerful enough to 'force a Muslim to forsake their faith'.

Valentine's Day - as it has elements of Christianity and 'its practice is mixed with immoral acts'.

Halloween - it is too Christian and is also 'associated with the devil'. 

Coffee - if the beans are defecated by animals before being processed.

The issue recently came to a head at a dog-petting festival for Muslims, with the organiser receiving threatening phone calls. 

Muslims are taught that canines are unclean. 

Malaysian activist Zainah Anwar, recently wrote that Muslims are 'sick and tired of being told, yet again, of more categories of Muslims and practices to be denounced, hated and declare deviant'.

Her women's rights group, Sisters in Islam, has also been targeted. It was issued with a fatwa for pushing 'liberalism'. It had pushed for Muslim women to be able to enter beauty pageants.

The group were challenging the ruling.  

The list of fatwas now includes, Halloween, which is said to be too Christian and black metal because it is 'powerful enough to force a Muslim to forsake his faith'.

Botox is banned, but can be used if medically necessary.
