In reality, Dick Advocaat has six games to save Sunderland's season and his own proud record of never having been relegated.

For you can as good as write off the last two matches of this desperate campaign, trips to Arsenal and Chelsea.

Sunderland have not won away in 2015 and there is no evidence to suggest they will start to do so at the home of top-four opponents. 

Sunderland interim manager Dick Advocaat has said his side will play 'ugly' football if they need to

Advocaat set out with beautiful intent at West Ham, naming three strikers having 24 hours earlier rubbished mention of his defensive reputation — but things have very quickly got ugly.

'The only important thing in the final games is winning,' said the 67-year-old, whose Premier League debut ended in defeat when Diafra Sakho struck two minutes from time.

'The way we do that is not important. So if we win games very ugly I like that. We will play very negative if the need is there.'

Advocaat has given his players the early part of the week off, an agreed rest period which is the legacy of Gus Poyet's ill-fated reign.

The Dutchman joked that the club don't have too many international players so their preparations for the visit of North-East rivals Newcastle a week on Sunday will not be disrupted.

That, you feel, is a match Sunderland must now win. By a quirk of footballing fate, previous bosses Paolo Di Canio and Poyet both enjoyed derby victories in their second match in charge.

For Advocaat, it is arguably his most winnable game of the eight remaining. Defeat is not an option.

'Being at home in derbies gives a big advantage,' he added. 'I know the intensity of these games — I was involved many times in Rangers against Celtic.

'I made the mistake of perhaps not realising that at first and I lost 5-1.

'But Newcastle for us now is the most important thing. We have a good period to practise and I think the (international) break is a good thing. I have time now to see what my best line-up will be.'

Hammers boss Sam Allardyce, meanwhile, has been linked with the Sunderland post at the end of the season.

He, however, wants a new deal at Upton Park after seeing his side climb to ninth.

'I don't know why people have speculated about me and Sunderland,' he said.

'I'm doing what I did here in my second year, my contract was running out then. 'At the end of the season we will look at the squad. We have to get more players in to build the club and make sure we sustain the growth we are achieving at this point in time.'
