There's nothing sweet about this intercontinental pastry feud.

A battle has erupted between Bergen and New York over which city has constructed the world's largest gingerbread village.

Guinness World Records last month named South Bronx chef Jon Lovitch's 1.5 ton cookie construction in New York City the globe's largest edible village - a decision that's miffed some proud Norwegians.

'Pepperkakebyen': Officials in Bergen, Norway claim the city's gingerbread village is the largest 'in the universe' even though New York claimed the official title this year

Bergen unveiled Gingerbread Town, or Pepperkakebyen, on Tuesday, which is spread across 380 square meters.

A major tourist attraction, the cookie village is constructed every year with slices of gingerbread baked by Bergen's schools and citizens

'Once again we have the record. It's 
just totally amazing, we simply have the largest, most beautiful and 
best gingerbread city in the universe,' Steinar Kristoffersen, who led the project, boasted at the opening, according to The Local.

While Bergen claims its gingerbread town is the world's biggest, this 
year's official title was claimed by a New York chef on November 17.

According to the Guinness World Records website, Lovitch's village meets all the record guidelines - the 135 residential and 22 commercial buildings were at least 5.9 inches tall.

But some Norwegians are challenging the decision.

Ørjan Jacobsen Fjeldstad wrote on the Guinness webpage: 'The yearly gingerbread city in Bergen, Norway is bigger than the official world record.'

Meryl Pearlstein, a New York PR professional, fired back: 'The Norwegian village does not meet the guidelines as it is spread out over a large space.'

Epic: Bergen's village includes 1,990 trains and buildings spread out over 380 square meters

Team effort: The buildings in Bergen's gingerbread village were baked by schools and individuals across the city

Thomas Ottosson, who worked on Bergen's village, told The Local the city may not be able to approach Guinness this year as it did not have recipes for each of the 1,990 buildings which were baked by schools and individuals.

'The difference is that the one in New York is all made from the same recipe, and when it's the same recipe he can make sure that all of it is edible,' he said. 'Guinness have some rules that everything should be edible, and they need the recipes.'

New York's creation, which is as heavy as a large hippopotamus and the size of a two-car garage, ticks all the Guinness boxes.

Lovitch, 37, began building the 'Gingerbread Lane' houses, ice rink, firehouse, and railroad stations at his apartment in February.

The Marriott Hotel executive chef said he spent a 'few grand' on the project, buying 400 pounds of candy, ingredients for 500 pounds of gingerbread dough and 2,240 pounds of icing.

The exhibit, on display at the New York Hall of Science in Queens, encompasses 157 structures glued together with thick icing.

'Being a chef, people may remember my meals for a day or two, but with the gingerbread, I can get thousands of people at a time checking out my work,' Lovitch told New York Times. 'I’ve gotten emails a year later, thanking me for it.'
