A political party in the Czech Republic is urging young people to vote in the upcoming European elections by saying it can help them get a job and therefore have sex at work.

The Czech Social Democratic party is using the advert for next week’s vote by showing a blonde woman who is clearly impatiently waiting in her office for a break.

When her break arrives, she goes into a nearby room and an off camera voice then says: ‘Everybody who wants to should be able to enjoy something a bit different during the break at work.’

The unusual advert begins with a blonde woman impatiently waiting in her office for a break 

During the ad by the Czech Social Democratic party, when the woman's break arrives, she goes into a nearby room

She closes the door behind her and an off camera voice says: 'It is a shame that there are half a million people that don't have jobs

It then shows in silhouette how the blonde woman and her lover apparently having sex in an adjoining room.

The ad then continues with the message: ‘It is a shame that there are half a million people that don't have jobs.’

Lukas Kaucky, who is the head of the CSSD youth organisation which organised the advertising spot said it had had a fantastic response and had been a huge success.

The risque ad has been welcomed by Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, who says it brings home the reality of unemployment

He said: 'We felt that the message was perfect for the internet but decided in the end not to take it to television because there were also critics.’

But one person who welcomed the ad was Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party since 2011.

He said sex at work was a fine thing and nothing to be frowned upon.

The Prime Minister explained: ‘I don't think one needs to be over necessarily prudish. The spot brings home the reality of unemployment.’
