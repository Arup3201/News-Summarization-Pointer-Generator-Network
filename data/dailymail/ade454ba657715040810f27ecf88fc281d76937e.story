Three couples, who are determined to build the restaurant of their dreams, have turned to crowd sourcing to fund their $100,000 project.

The entrepreneurs, who also co-own another bar in Perth, have so far raised over $80,000 for the creation of Lucky Chan's Laundry and Noodle Bar which, if successful, will be the first permanent crowd-funded restaurant in Australia.

One of the creative minds behind the community project, Andrew Bennet, told Daily Mail Australia that donors were not contributing to a charity, but would have their money returned to them in another form.

'Every dollar that people contribute is matched, dollar for dollar with a reward or a giveback. They are given an opportunity to redeem that value at the restaurant when it opens,' Mr Bennet said.

'That's really important as to why we've been so successfully.' 

The 32-year-old said that donation options start from as little as $5, with which donors will have their name painted on the 'Great Wall of Chan'.

'The top tier pledge level is $20,000 and we have actually had two different people take that on,' he said.

'One of them is a lovely couple who are getting married next year and wanted something different for their wedding reception, location and theme. We'll be closing down the venue just for them, as we won't take bookings like this in the future. 

With only 15 days to go, the team of entrepreneurs have raised more than $80,000 of their $100,000 limit

One of the future owners of the restaurant, Andrew Bennet (right), said the crowd-sourcing project was not just about sourcing money, but also about hearing design and food ideas from the future customers 

'We are also taking the chance to sit down with them and work through wedding cocktails and food for the one off because we've been blown away by their support.' 

One of the most popular pledges is the Lucky Chan Hot Date, designed for a couple to donate $55 towards the building of the restaurant and in return receive a romantic dinner and drinks for two to the value of $85.

But it's not just about sourcing money, Mr Bennet explains. Even if the owners don't reach their  $100,000 target in the next 15 days – which would mean they don't receive a cent of the pledged donations, Lucky Chan's will still come to life. 

The future owners of the bar have been using their donations' page and social media to ask people what they want the future bar and restaurant to serve and even look like and also to create excitement about the coming venue.

'On the hard dollar side of things, one hundred thousand isn't going to be the complete funding budget for project,' Mr Bennet said.

'The reality is that if the Kickstarter campaign didn't go ahead, Lucky Chan's will still be a reality – perhaps a smaller less compelling vision than what we had planned, but with Kickstarter it will be enriched by not only financial support but their thoughts and opinions and the feedback about what they want to see when it opens.

'The feedback we've been getting most is about our opening hours. A lot of restaurants and bars close at midnight and from day one of our campaign people were telling us they wanted a late night option for a good quality meal and drink - and not just the hard core hospitality nerds but mums and dads and professionals.

'We've also had great feedback about the décor. We're planning to have a large open air courtyard at the top – so there have been suggestions on how to animate that space at night, like Chinese lanterns or kind of silent movie screen. So all these ideas that we haven't thought of is exactly why we caught these nets out and want to hear from our future customers.'

The highest contributors include a couple who have donated $20,000 for Lucky Chan's to be built, and in return will have their wedding reception at the venue 

'People end up feeling like they own a bit of their own bar, which is exactly what we wanted.'

If all goes to plan, Luck Chan's will open in early January of 2015 as a quirky restaurant and bar that resembles an old Chinese Laundry that has been haphazardly reorganised into a speak-easy.

'The idea was to create a late night venue in North Bridge which paid homage to the history and culture of the Asian migration in the area,' Mr Bennet said.

'One of the industries that many brought with them was the concept of the Chinese laundry and in some small areas during the 1900s, there were something like between 50 and 70 of them.

'We are not pretending that we are doing an authentic Asian restaurant by any means, we just want to pay respect and homage to deep flavours and tastes that went before us.'
