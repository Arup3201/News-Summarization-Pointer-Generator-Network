A private jet en-route to Australia has reportedly been intercepted after violating Indonesia's airspace.

The ABC says two fighter planes forced the Gulfstream jet to land in Indonesia on Monday.

It was carrying seven passengers and six crew, who are now being questioned by Indonesian authorities, according to an air force spokesman.

The ABC reports a Gulfstream private jet was intercepted en route to Darwin from Saudi Arabia 

The plane's intended flight path starting from Saudi Arabia, with a fuel stop in Singapore

The aircraft is believed to have been travelling from Saudi Arabia to Darwin, and had made a refuelling stop in Singapore before taking off again and entering Indonesian airspace without clearance.

The incident comes two weeks after an Australian light plane flew into Indonesian airspace without the correct documentation.

Two Australians agreed to pay a fine for flying in Indonesian airspace without permit on October 22.

Indonesian fighter jet pilots were moments away from shooting down the light plane piloted by the two Australian nationals who reportedly failed to comply with Indonesia's order to land.

Graeme Paul Jacklin (front) and Richard Wayne MacLean (back) were taken into custody after being forced to land their light plane after allegedly 'violating' Indonesian airspace on Wednesday

Indonesian pilot Major Wanda Suriansyah said two Sukhoi fighters 'locked' their weapon systems and aimed directly at the Australian plane carrying pilots Graeme Paul Jacklin and Richard Wayne MacLean,Tempo.co reported.  

'If there had been a command to shoot, I would immediately have shot it down, but thank God the pilot was apparently scared and decided to land the plane in Manado,' Major Wanda said.

Mr Jacklin and Mr MacLean were en route from Darwin to the Philippines when their light plane was detected over Indonesian waters at 8am on Wednesday.

The pair, who are professional delivery pilots, were flying to Cebu in the Philippines to deliver the light plane after selling it.

Comment is being sought from Indonesian and Australian authorities.
