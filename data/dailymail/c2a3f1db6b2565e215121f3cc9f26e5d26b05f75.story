New England Patriots star Vince Wilfork helped a woman out of an overturned car in Foxborough, Massachusetts just hours after helping his team reach the Super Bowl.

The 33-year-old defensive tackle pulled a woman from her rolled-over car on Sunday night having just played in New England's 45-7 win over the Indianapolis Colts.

Police responded to the incident around 12.45am and when they arrived they found Wilfork already assisting the trapped 38-year-old Mary Ellen Brooks.

Massachusetts State Police shared an image on Twitter of the overturned jeep at the scene where Wilfork offered a helping hand.

Wilfork will be looking to win his second Super Bowl with the New England Patriots against the Seattle Seahawks in Glendale, Arizona on February 1.

The defensive tackle was drafted with the No 21 pick of the 2004 draft by the Patriots and has been in Foxborough ever since.

On Monday, he told ESPN.com: 'Through football and the course of life, I've learned to try to stay poised in certain situations and I'm pretty sure she was kind of scared.

'The last thing I wanted to do was have her panic, and that was the first thing I told her, "Don't panic. We'll get you out of here." We got her out, the cops came and that was about it.

'I saw the lady in there and asked her if she was OK. She grabbed my hand, and kind of talked her through. It wasn't a big deal. It was seeing someone that needed help and helping.

The driver was unharmed, but arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and negligent operation of a motor vehicle.

Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said: 'He's got a lot of character and a lot of integrity, how generous he is with his time and personal support, and the time and interest and compassion he has for other fellow human beings.

'It doesn't surprise me because that's really the type of person he is.'
