Carla Bruni has admitted to craving cigarettes whilst pregnant with her first child.

The model said that even though giving birth was ‘fulfilling’, she enjoyed it less because she was unable to smoke the entire time.

In an interview the wife of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy also said that she found breastfeeding ‘absolutely sensual’ and revealed that ‘intimacy’ is what keeps her love alive.

Cravings: Carla Bruni admitted that pregnancy would have been more enjoyable if she had been allowed to smoke

Miss Bruni, 44, gave birth to daughter Giulia in November last year when Mr Sarkozy, 57, was still in office.

The two met at a dinner party in 2007 and got married the following year. It was her first time down the aisle, his third.

Speaking to Vogue, Miss Bruni suggested she appears to have resisted her urge to smoke whilst pregnant, not least because of the health concerns.

She said: ‘Pregnancy, giving birth... there are women who like it.

She also said she found breastfeeding 'sensual' and revealed that 'intimacy' is what keeps her love alive

‘It is certainly fulfilling - but... In the eighth month, I wanted to go on a trampoline, smoke cigarettes.’

In the interview Miss Bruni said her verdict on giving birth was that it was a ‘sort of fabulous miracle’.

She said: ‘It’s always astounded me to have succeeded at having kids. It’s crazy!

‘Perhaps the little girl inside me did not ever imagine being able to incarnate that reality’.

Prior to meeting Mr Sarkozy, Miss Bruni had been linked with a string of men including Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton.

But despite being sought after she was grateful to be married because it ‘put an end to solitude’, she said.

Miss Bruni said: ‘Before, I only knew solitude. I liked it... When I married the president of the republic I was stupefied by the way people judged me. It would never occur to me to judge anyone. I only judge people in one way. I like them or I don’t. But I don’t have preconceived ideas.’

They key to a good relationship, according to Miss Bruni, is ‘intimacy’ which she describes as ‘the geographical sharing of the physical life’ even if it is just sleeping or eating together.

She also believes that Mr Sarkozy has been faithful to her, as she has to him, even though he is not the love of her life.

She said: ‘I would not say he is the man of my life, I don’t like the expression — at this moment my father is also the man of my life, or my brother — but in any case he is the man I married.’

In an extract of the interview already published Miss Bruni said that a woman’ s place is in the home and that ‘we don’t need to be feminist in my generation’.

Following outrage from women’s rights groups she apologised and said the remark was ‘very clumsy’.
