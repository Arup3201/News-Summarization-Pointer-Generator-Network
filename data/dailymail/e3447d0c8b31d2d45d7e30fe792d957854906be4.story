'Choose your weapon!' This might sound like the opening line of a film about ninjas or soldiers but instead, it's an everyday phrase for the UK's dominatrices - a group who spend their days taking whips, riding crops and canes to their willing clients.

One of their number is Mistress Dita, a former prison administrative officer from Hull, who agreed to speak to Rupert Everett as part of his new documentary series, Love for Sale.

She's offering him a close encounter with her arsenal of riding crops and canes, which she intends him to use on her willing 'slave' standing in a corner, trussed up in full leather bondage wear.

Rupert Everett talks to Dominatrix - Mistress Dita in her home in Hull

He chooses a cane and then watches in fascination as Mistress Dita wields it with panache, each thwack leaving red stripes on her client's back.

'That was a particularly shocking moment,' he reveals. 'Being in the same room as a dominatrix as she dealt with her client, that is not normally in a day's work.'

Michael Waldman, the director of Channel 4's Love for Sale has explored the sex world before in previous documentaries but had never been treated to a live show.

This time around, the director was determined to find out exactly who was paying for these kind of niche sexual services.

'We wanted to talk to both Dita and her client. We spoke to him once the cameras were off and he wasn't wearing his gimp mask and he was a perfectly normal, nice, intelligent man.'

Mistress Dita has around 100 clients and says that she could have another ten years in the business

The services of Mistress Dita, who has around 100 regular clients, may come as a shock to those who are unfamiliar with the world of S&M, although not quite as much as the latest addition to her repertoire.

'I've introduced hard sports into my repertoire' she tells a curious Rupert. 'So hard sports is the poo and water sports is the wee. I save my waste from the morning then I feed it to my clients. There's a big market for it.'

Astonishingly, Mistress Dita says there is such a large demand for her waste she even has own website, selling everything from gift vouchers, to toe nail clippings and worn underwear but she says that by far the most popular item on sale is her faeces.

'I sell a 
lot ,' she explains. 'I send it through Royal Mail, my first one yesterday went to Stoke on Trent, it was Â£25.'

Even Mistress Dita says that she doesn't really understand what her clients get out of it.

'I've been in this business 
for three years and I still can't put my finger on why guys want it but 
all I can say is each to their own,' she says.

Mistress Dita uses a selection of 'weapons' on her clients

'I
 never judge anyone because I've worked in a prison with sex offenders 
and paedophiles so all I think is that there are far worse things men 
can be doing.'

Bizarrely, halfway through her interview, Dita's mother enters with the promise of a quiche for Rupert, so what do her family make of her profession.

'The only way I could have 
shocked my friends and family is if I had told them I was settling down 
and having kids,' she reveals.

'They were really supportive, especially my mum who even 
made Rupert and the crew a packed lunch.' 

Dita works seven days a week and never takes any holiday so she's certainly not lacking in work ethic but will she ever swap the world of the dominatrix for something more mainstream?

'As
 a dom, you are expected to be older, and at 44, I could have another ten years 
left in me,' she says, thoughtfully.

'I don't think I want to do it for that long though,' she qualifies. 'I'd love to 
help the street walkers of Hull who are vulnerable. Maybe set up a 
centre for them. But at the moment I love what I'm doing.'

It's certainly not for everyone, although Everett remains cool throughout - even when confronted with some of the more arcane tools of Dita's trade.

'Oh yes, he is completely unembarrassed by anything which is extremely unusual' says director Waldman.

'The fact that he is so unfazed makes him completely perfect for the job. Other people might be worried or scared or concerned about how they look but Rupert sails through.

'And the fact that we are shocked by how unfazed Rupert is makes us question why we are so fazed ourselves.'

Rupert believes that sex workers need protecting and we should stop discriminating against them

The fact that Rupert comes across as so nonjudgmental was key to making the sex workers who appear in the documentary feel comfortable enough to share a glimpse into their lives.

And Mistress Dita certainly isn't the only unconventional star of the show.

Another is Sammy, a former builder and father of two, who allows Everett to perch on the bed at his home in Milton Keynes as he prepares to set up a live webcam for 50p a minute online sex.

Sammy has been taking female replacement hormones for the past three years but still possesses male genitalia and caters to a very specific type of client.

As Sammy begins to provide the service for one of his regular clients, in full view of Everett and the Channel 4 film crew, he continues to chat - despite the bizarre situation.

'Meeting 
Sammy was a very odd situation' continues Waldmann.

'The film crew were 
stood in the room, Sammy was lay on the bed with his legs apart and 
Rupert was balanced on the bed looking bemused but not taken aback.

'That
 is my job as the director to create an atmosphere that is more relaxing
 for people like Sammy so you can achieve a more human reaction.'

Everett himself has strong opinions on the sex trade, confessing to having used male
 prostitutes himself and says sex workers are in need of 
support not discrimination.

'I
 don't think it's an issue - too bad if some people have a problem with buying
 sex,' insists the 54-year-old.

'They should be so lucky to be 
buying sex! Selling sex is much more precarious, it's a terrifying thing
 to do, but they need support that's what I really think.'

Despite Everett's support for sex work, Waldmann insists that this is not necessarily the message the documentary carries.

'Rupert had a very personal view, he wasn't an objective reporter,' he explains. 'He was passionately interested.

'However we wanted to make sure that he heard voices of those he didn't agree with and make sure there was a range of views.'

The programme is undeniably eye opening but does Waldmann believe it will alter the British attitude to the sex industry?

'Society will always have a problem with prostitution,' he admits. 'And I wouldn't say that there is no problem,.

'It is by no means an enviable profession, but what I do hope is that the programme makes us a little less judgmental.

'You can't assume everyone who's involved is evil and I hope people think about that.'
