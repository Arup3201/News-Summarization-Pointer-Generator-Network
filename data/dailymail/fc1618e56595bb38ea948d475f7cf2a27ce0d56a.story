With his blue eyes, toned abs and chiselled features, model Andrew Cooper is the archetypal Diet Coke hunk

The British model has been unveiled as the new face of Diet Coke and is starring in the new Diet Coke break ad, titled 'Gardener'.

In the clip, the 32-year-old is seen stripping off his shirt after being soaked with a can of the fizzy drink - much to the delight of a watching group of women.

Smouldering: Andrew Cooper plays a hunky gardener in the new Diet Coke break ad

Thanks Diet Coke! British model and former singer Andrew Cooper stars in the 2013 ad

Toned: In the ad, hunky Cooper is forced to strip off after being doused with Diet Coke

Set to the Etta James track, 'I Just Want To Make Love To You', used in all the Diet Coke break adverts so far, the steamy new skit was shot on location in South Africa.

It begins with group of female friends sipping Diet Coke over lunch in a park and watching a handsome landscape gardener mowing the grass.

One of the girls has an idea and sets a Diet Coke can rolling down the hill - timing it perfectly so its path intercepts the gardener.

He picks it up and opens it, only to be soaked by a jet of Diet Coke, and smiling, removes his t-shirt before returning to his mowing.

Mancunian one-time wannabe singer and Diet Coke Hunk Cooper said: 'Everyone remembers the Diet Coke Man advertisements.

'They have been cultural milestones and I’m absolutely thrilled to have been chosen to play the part in 2013 - especially in such an exciting year for the brand.'

Oops! He opens it only to be sprayed with frothed up fizz. Next up: the good bit...

That's more like it! The watching women (and womankind everywhere) react with delight

The new ad has been launched to celebrate Diet Coke's 30th birthday, which will also see Robert Merrill, the handsome star of the 1998 ad, make a triumphant return to the small screen.

First aired in 1994, the original Diet Coke break starred Lucky Vanous as a hunky construction worker who kept a group of 
admiring women in an office glued to their window every day at 11.30am 
when he paused for a can of Diet Coke.

The innovative campaign became a 
cultural phenomenon and flipped traditional gender roles on their head. 
The series evolved with fresh incarnations in 1997 and 
2007.

Merrill, who now stars in 90210, CSI and Californication, says: 'I still do have a love affair with Diet Coke. She's been good to me for all these years.'

'Women got excited when they saw the Diet
Coke Hunk commercials.'

'Being objectified by women is a pretty 
good feeling if you ask me, and I felt like a rock star. Life is short 
and the commercial was harmless.'

Diet Coke launched in 1982 and twelve years later, released the original 'Diet Coke Break Hunk' advert featuring American model and actor Lucky Vanous.

The 1994 ad sees Lucky as a handsome 
construction worker on a building site, keeping a group of admiring 
women in an office building glued to their window.

The 1998 Hunk Robert Merrill kept ladies on time as a sexy window cleaner

In 1998 the second Diet Coke Break 
Hunk advert featured Robert Merrill keeping ladies on time for their 
11.30am appointment as an unforgettable window cleaner.

But in 2007, Diet Coke caused a storm by letting their their Hunk keep his top on - much to the disappointment of female fans.

Played by 28-year-old French skater and Economics graduate Francois Xavier, the lift engineer comes to rescue three ladies after they get (intentionally) stuck in an office lift.

The latest version of the iconic advertising campaign stars hunky British model, Andrew Cooper, as a gardener who gets into a spot of bother with a shaken up can of Diet Coke.

With Diet Coke spraying everywhere and soaking his shirt, the hunk is forced to remove it - much to the delight of a watching group of ladies.

Launched to mark the brand's 30th birthday, the new campaign will also see the return of fellow topless hunk, Robert Merrill.
