A person claiming to have an X-rated tape of the late Tonight Show host Johnny Carson and one of his wives is shopping the video around to private collectors.

According to TMZ, the owner of the video, which dates from the late-1970s, tried to sell it to the Johnny Carson estate last year but was rebuffed.

The executors of the estate threatened to sue the owner of the video if was ever released.

However, the video is now being touted to private collectors for an undisclosed sum.

For legal reasons the video cannot be sold to a porn distribution company.

Six-time Emmy winner Carson was married four times. He divorced his second wife Joan Copeland in 1972 and married his third, former model Joanna Holland that same year.

The tape allegedly features Carson and a dark haired woman with a bouffant 'do who has not been named but is purportedly one of his wives, meaning Holland is likely to be the woman in question.

The raunchy tape has two locations - by the pool and in the bedroom, reports TMZ.

And Carson was apparently a gifted performer both on and off-screen.

The
 legendary host was also a well-known lothario. In between his four 
marriages - at least one of which was blighted by infidelity - Carson 
was a committed ladies man.

Legal threat: Carson's estate was offered the video to purchase but refused and threatened to sue its peddler (Carson is pictured here with Holland)

According to the biography 'Johnny Carson,' written by the star's longtime lawyerÂ  and confidant Henry Bushkin, he once had a contract out on his life from the mob due to his romantic entanglements.

During his third marriage to Joanna Holland, wrote Bushkin, Carson showered her with gifts, including an apartment at The Pierre, a Rolls-Royce Corniche, and diamonds galore, as compensation for his many indiscretions.

'Joanna discovered a film of Johnny in flagrante with a comely young lady,' Bushkin writes, 'after which she furiously shattered every vase, every picture frame, every single thing made of glass in her living room, creating such a dangerous mess that a hazmat team had to be hired to clean up.'

Carson passed away in 2005 at the age of 79. He is survived by his fourth wife Alexis Maas Carson.

There is no word yet on a buyer for the video.
