This is a county season full of opportunity, with domestic performances counting towards England selection more than at any time in years, but certainly Eoin Morgan has more to play for than most.

Morgan is the man England are desperate to include in all forms of the game, so much so that they dangled a particularly juicy carrot in front of him by suggesting that a Test comeback could be his if he withdrew from the Indian Premier League.

The early weeks of the season have seen others provide a more convincing case than Morgan for what would seem to be one Test middle-order vacancy at No 5 — notably Gary Ballance. But the Irishman is very much in contention to face Sri Lanka next month even if he does not score a shedload of runs.

It is not just Morgan’s ability to provide the flair England will be missing post Kevin Pietersen, it is also his temperament and leadership ability that make him so important.

One of the reasons Alastair Cook has not come under more pressure as captain is the dearth of alternatives.

Stuart Broad has one of the best cricket brains in the side but, as he intimated this week, he may have to give up the Twenty20 captaincy as he prioritises Test and one-day cricket. As a fast bowler grappling with modern schedules, he could not contemplate any extra responsibility. With Ian Bell never really dispelling the feeling that he is more follower than leader and Joe Root not ready, that leaves Morgan as the only viable alternative to Cook.  

No pressure: Cook has something of a leadership vacuum beneath him

Morgan’s 16-match Test career has hardly been a disaster, as two centuries would testify, and he has eradicated the glitch that saw him crouching excessively at the crease during his last, ill-fated series against Pakistan.

He has always argued that Test cricket is his priority but it has not looked that way when he has seemed happier to sit on the benches of IPL clubs than try to prove himself in first-class cricket.

Now that has changed. ‘The last two years opportunities haven’t been there,’ argued Morgan, 27.

‘One-day cricket has been my strength. I was a late starter in red-ball cricket. I am still learning and trying to improve, but I don’t think a lesser stint in the IPL or an extra couple of Aprils in England would have helped me get back in the Test side before now.

Found out: Morgan's last Test outing came against Pakistan in February 2012

‘Now, I think, everybody sees a big chance. Having played a bit in the past and enjoyed my time in the Test team, I would like to be back on board.’

Morgan, who will captain Middlesex’s one-day side this year, travels to Aberdeen for Friday’s first international of the season knowing that by the end of the summer he could have cemented himself in Test cricket again.

And given England another leadership option.

BUMBLE'S WORLD - What caught David Lloyd's eye this week:

The Good

The new broom has swept clean and here we go post-KP. It’s great to see so many young players coming to the fore in English cricket — Sam Robson is all the rage and has a chance of playing Test cricket soon, while plenty more are putting themselves in the shop window.

Knocking on the door: Australia-born Sam Robson is expected to open with Cook

I’ve been up at Durham this week where, among eye-catching performances from Adam Lyth and Jonny Bairstow, I’ve been very impressed by another likely lad in Durham opener Mark Stoneman.

Opportunity knocks!

The Bad

So good has this game between Durham and Yorkshire been that I can’t understand why Joe Root and Gary Ballance have been kicking their heels at a Loughborough training camp rather than getting miles in their legs here.

It’s nonsense. England’s argument is that their players have needed white-ball practice before playing Scotland on Friday but white, red, pink or green it’s still a ball.

They should have been playing in a game at this stage of the season.

NEWMAN’S FINAL WORD

Interesting though it will be to visit the Aberdeen ground where Sir Don Bradman scored his last century on British soil when England play Scotland on Friday, it does seem extraordinary that Mannofield will host the first international of the domestic season. Cricket schedules are increasingly barmy but Aberdeen on May 9? The forecast is for cold and wet weather — who would have thought it for spring in northern Scotland?
