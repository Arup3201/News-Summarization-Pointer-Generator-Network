The arrest of ‘femme fatale’ spy Anna Chapman in America was the trigger for MI5 to target a Russian blonde having an affair with an MP in the UK, it was alleged yesterday.

Katia Zatuliveter, 26, was accused of spying only when the British Secret Service decided it ‘had better see’ if there were other Moscow-backed women using sex to ensnare powerful men, a court heard.

MI5, it is claimed, swiftly believed the Commons research assistant had been recruited by the Russians as a teenager and ‘worked her way through significant men to get secrets’.

But Miss Zatuliveter was really targeted because she had ‘many similarities’ with Chapman, a deportation tribunal heard.

This is because both Russians were ‘young, attractive and adept networkers’.

Miss Zatuliveter admits having an 
affair with Mike Hancock, 65, the MP for Portsmouth South and a then 
member of the Commons defence select committee.

But her lawyers insist MI5 had decided
 she must be a spy simply because Mr Hancock was ‘pro-Russian’ and ‘had 
vulnerabilities in his private life’.

Femme fatale: Russian spy Anna Chapman

Yesterday a woman MI5 officer known as
 witness ZZ said Russian intelligence would have marked Mr Hancock out 
‘as a good candidate’ to be targeted by a female Russian spy.

As well as having an affair with Mr Hancock, Miss Zatuliveter admits being sexually involved with an unnamed Nato official.

Tim Owen QC, for Miss Zatuliveter, said these two affairs were ‘the crux of the security services case against her’.

He added: ‘Your case is that she has been an agent since 17 or 18 and working her way through significant men to get secrets.’

Giving evidence from behind a curtain,
 the MI5 agent admitted these points were part of the case against Miss 
Zatuliveter but could not be discussed ‘in open’ session.

They will be 
considered in a closed session of the hearing by special 
security-cleared advocates.

The FBI arrested Chapman in June 2010,
 and Miss Zatuliveter was stopped for questioning at Gatwick airport in 
August the same year.

Miss Zatuliveter was appearing for the
 second day before the tribunal in a bid to remain in the UK. The 
Government wants to deport her on the grounds her presence is a danger 
to national security.

Spy links: Miss Zatuliveter was compared to her compatriot Anna Chapman, and it was said that it would not be obvious that either worked for Russian intelligence

Similarities: Anna Chapman was likened to Miss Zatuliveter because they were both 'young and adept networkers'

ZZ said she was familiar with the 
Chapman case in the U.S. She said: ‘The security services case is there 
are similarities but not by any means the same.’

She said one difference is the FBI ‘has found an evidential case which could be described in open in a criminal prosecution.’

Mr Owen said: ‘The difference is the FBI has got some evidence. Yes?’ 

The MI5 officer replied: ‘I’m unable to disclose what is in the closed case, but there is a closed case.’

Mr Owen asked her: ‘Your decision to 
become interested in Miss Zatuliveter in 2010 was entirely because of 
Anna Chapman, wasn’t it?’

The agent denied the suggestion.

The hearing was told Miss Chapman had an ‘obvious route’ into espionage, as her father was involved in Russian Intelligence.

ZZ said: ‘To ordinary members of the 
public, to someone who meets Miss Chapman or Miss Zatuliveter in public,
 it wouldn’t be obvious they were working for the Russian Intelligence 
services.’

Mr Owen asked ZZ: ‘Are you saying 
this woman was able to co-exist for four years in a relationship with 
Mike Hancock, genuinely loving him…but all the time acting in secret 
with the Russian Intelligence Service?'

ZZ said: ‘I’m afraid I’ve gone as far as I can in open [session] on this question.’

Mr Owen also referred to a statement 
from Miss Zatuliveter’s brother in law who said he thought it unlikely 
she was a spy as she was often ill and unlikely to be able to cope with 
the ‘pressure’ of espionage.

Miss Zatuliveter began working for Mr Hancock in 2006, later getting a Commons pass and moving into his London flat.

The hearing continues.
