Michael Sam vowed today to help win the Super Bowl for the Dallas Cowboys  - but first he has to make the team.

The first openly-gay NFL player suited up with the Cowboys this afternoon after coaches picked him for the practice squad as a defensive end. He has the option to make the team if he plays well enough.

The decision by one of the league's most popular teams means that Sam's dreams of football stardom get another chance after he was cut earlier this week by the St. Louis Rams.

In a press conference today, Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett said:
 'We feel like he has a chance to come in at a position we’ve tried to 
address really throughout the off-season, throughout training camp, and 
compete for a spot... We just want to give him a chance to come in and 
see if he can help our football team.'

This afternoon, Sam tweeted: 'As a kid growing up in Texas I always loved the Dallas Cowboys, so to join this incredible organization is really a dream come true.

Michael Sam suited up for the Dallas Cowboys today after the team picked him for its practice squad and a shot to play on game day

Michael Sam's talents as a defensive end could be put to use on the Cowboys, who are  by some accounts 'desperate' for players in his position

National attention: Media focus shifted to Dallas after Sam arrived at Cowboys practice on Wednesday. He has become one of the most popular watched players in the NFL

'I look 
forward to putting my helmet and pads on every day to work my hardest to
 help bring a sixth Super Bowl Championship to Dallas!!'

The
 college football star was cut this week by the St. Louis Rams, the team
 that made national headlines when coaches drafted him in the seventh 
round. The defensive end showed promise in preseason games, but not 
enough to win a spot on the Rams' 55-man roster or the practice squad.

On Tuesday night as he jetted out of St. Louis, Sam exclusively told MailOnline that he was 'excited to be to be joining Dallas, I just want to play football.'

He also suggested the Cowboys could have use for him.

'I never followed the Cowboys growing up 
because I never had a team. I am a fan of defenses and Dallas need some 
help, that's why I'm going,' he told MailOnline.

Indeed, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram described the Cowboys' search new players on its defensive line as 'desperate.'

The
 Cowboys lost defensive tackle Jason Hatcher and defensive end DeMarcus 
Ware in the off-season. Defensive end Anthony Spencer is still 
recovering from knee surgery and second-round draft pick defensive end 
DeMarcus Lawrence broke his foot in training camp.

When the Rams announced their final pick for the 2014 season, Sam’s name wasn't on the roster, despite having an impressive pre-season.

'It's been a roller coaster this past week but I'm happy where I'm at now.

‘I'm just looking forward to being a Cowboy, my focus is on making the team.’

Initially there were fears that no team in the NFL would pick Sam up but the 24-year-old’s dreams are back on track.

‘It has all happened so quickly, but it's exciting, I just wanna get back to playing football you know.

'I haven't had chance to speak to any of my family yet, not even my mom, but I will.'

The former Missouri College star said he’s now come full-circle.

Sam, who one day dreams of earning the big bucks many NFL superstars enjoy, had to settle for economy class on this trip.

It's been a rough road for Sam. After being dropped by the Rams Sam posted an upbeat message to his Twitter account on Saturday despite his obstacles.

'The most worthwhile things in life rarely come easy, this is a lesson I've always known. The journey continues.'

Sam had garnered a lot of media attention (pictured on July 29 at a Rams training camp) after he became the first openly gay player to be drafted

Sam’s shock departure from the Rams had had some people inside the sport questioning if his sexual orientation was simply too much of a distraction.

Buffalo Bills offensive lineman Eric Wood said the media was too blame for focusing on the personal life of the NFL's first openly gay draft pick.

'Blame that on espn,' Wood tweeted on Tuesday. 'No one wants the distraction.'

Wood's comment came after sports commentator Ross Tucker had publicly wondered on Twitter why 'Michael Sam performed much better than most expected and still isn't even on a practice squad?'
