Racehorses have better lives than some children, according to a jockey tipped to win the Grand National this weekend.

Katie Walsh, due to ride second favourite Seabass in Saturday’s meeting, was defending the race against those who label it barbaric. 

Two horses, including the favourite Synchronised, died in last year's running at Aintree. Since then further welfare changes, including a new fence design, have been made.

However, Walsh believes that horse deaths should be put in perspective when compared to the fall that left Irish jockey JT McNamara paralysed at the Cheltenham Festival last month.

Walsh, whose brother Ruby will ride favourite On His Own, said: ‘Anyone who gets up on Christmas Day and mucks out loves animals. Sure, it’s a dangerous sport but every night, all over the world, a lot of horses are left out in fields starving.

‘These horses are so well looked after. Better than some children, to be honest with you. 

‘I don’t read the criticism because it’s not worth it. At the end of the day it would be a lot worse if it had been two jockeys who lost their lives. I think everyone should remember that.’

In an interview with Radio Times, Walsh added: ‘I hope to God there are no accidents this year, but these things happen, and they’re horses at the end of the day.

‘I don’t mean that in a cruel way, but to see John Thomas McNamara get a horrible fall at Cheltenham… he’s gone from the neck down, and that’s a different deal altogether in my eyes.’

Claude Knights, the director of welfare charity Kidscape, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Obviously we have a duty of care to look after animals but it doesn't compare to the duty of care we have for our children.

'Racehorses, while not exploited, are still tools that are being used for commercial use.

'When
children are used in the same way, on shows like the X Factor, when 
their emotions are seen very publicly , the consequences are not very 
pleasant. I don't think making comparisons help either cause.'

Walsh
achieved the best Grand National finish for a female jockey when third 
last year on Seabass, a horse trained by her father Ted.

Changes
to the course by Aintree bosses include replacing the solid wood cores 
of all fences with plastic or birch, which is softer on the horse and 
moving the race starting point away from the noise of the grandstand to 
stop the horses getting overwhelmed.

Chance: Katie Walsh will team up with Seabass for Saturday's famous race

The racecard order of the horses will be arranged in the parade ring instead of in front of spectators in the stands.

Security is also being reviewed by police, who fear extreme animal rights groups may try to disrupt the meeting.

There are peaceful protests planned by Animal Aid and Fight Against Animal Cruelty in Europe.
