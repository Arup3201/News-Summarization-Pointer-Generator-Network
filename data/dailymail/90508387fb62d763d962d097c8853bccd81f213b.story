It is one of the most eye-popping feats of modern architecture in the world. 

The hyper-modern ship-like Louis Vuitton art museum opened its doors on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne park, on Monday in a glitzy ceremony attended by French president François Hollande.

Designed by architect Frank Gehry, known for designing the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the Guggenheim Museum building in Bilbao, Spain, the striking structure boasts 12 glass sails which billow around the museum's main building - nicknamed 'the iceberg'.

The Louis Vuitton Foundation, nicknamed the 'iceberg' was designed by architect Frank Gehry, known for designing the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the Guggenheim Museum building in Bilbao, Spain

The edifice has been thirteen years in the making and is funded by France's richest man, Bernard Arnault, who heads up the LVMH luxury goods empire.

Gehry said he was inspired by the lightness of late 19th-century glass and garden architecture.

The 85-year-old architect explained that he wanted to 'design, in Paris, a magnificent vessel symbolising the cultural calling of France'.

'It is a very unusual building. I have never designed anything exactly like it,' he said on the foundation's website, which describes it as 'an iconic building for the 21st century'. 

Inside, eleven galleries provide 3,850 square metres  of exhibition space to house shows and a permanent collection, which will include works borrowed from Arnault's personal collection.

The project was undertaken by 100 engineers assembled by famed Los Angeles-based architect Gehry and a total of 3,000 workers.

The privately owned museum is open to the public this week, but will be donated to the city of Paris in 50 years

French media reports say the project's initial price tag of approximately 100 million euros - around £80 million -  has been surpassed.

The privately owned museum will open to the public on October 27, but will be donated to the city of Paris in 50 years. 

From the inside, visitors will have views of the  surrounding Jardin d'Acclimatation in the Bois de Boulogne, as well as the Eiffel Tower and La Defense business centre.

The building faced stiff opposition from neighbourhood groups worried about less green space. 

As well as the  foundation's inauguration, the FIAC contemporary art fair begins on Thursday, with 26 countries displaying art in 191 galleries at the Grand Palais museum.

The Picasso Museum, which houses one of the world's most extensive collections of the Spanish master's work, will also reopen on Saturday after five years of renovation.
