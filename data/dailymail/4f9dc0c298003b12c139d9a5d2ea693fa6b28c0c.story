Kim Kardashian's wedding dress looked sensational in front of a floor-to-ceiling white flower backdrop on her big day - and Kanye West has revealed that the ceremony's visual harmony was no fluke.

The 37-year-old rapper admitted at the Cannes Lions Festival on Tuesday that the couple built the backdrop specifically to match Mrs Kardashian West's Haute Couture Givenchy gown.

But the extravagant flower wall turned out to be problematic when, one day before the Florence ceremony, photographer Annie Leibovitz pulled out of shooting their wedding pictures.

big day - and Kanye West has revealed that the ceremony's visual harmony
 was no fluke

'Because Annie pulled out, I was 
like “I still want my wedding photos to look like Annie Leibovitz’s 
photos,"' he revealed to the crowd. 

'So we sat there and worked on that photo for four days – 
because the flowers were off-color and stuff like that,' he said, referring to the couple's first official wedding photo, which was eventually released on Mrs Kardashian West's Instagram account after undergoing extensive retouching. 

‘Can
 you imagine telling someone who wants to just Instagram a photo, who’s 
the number one person on Instagram, “We need to work on the color of 
the flower wall”, or the idea that it’s a Givenchy dress, and it’s not 
about the name Givenchy, it’s about the talent that is Riccardo Tisci - 
and how important Kim is to the internet,' he explained.

The couple – known as Kimye – tied the knot at the Forte di Belvedere in Florence last month in what is billed as the wedding of the year.

However, fans had to wait days for the official photograph, called The Kiss, to be released. And for the first time, rapper Mr West revealed why during a panel discussion about technology and culture.

The
 discussion, entitled ‘Technology, Culture and Consumer Adoption: 
Learning to Read the Cultural Landscape,’ talked about how digital 
progress and cultural evolution are linked.

Mr West also revealed how the extensive Photoshopping of their first Instagram picture 'pissed my girl off during the honeymoon'.

'We sat there and worked on that photo for four days – 
because the flowers were off-color and stuff like that'

'She was exhausted because we worked on the photo so much - because Annie Leibovitz pulled out of the wedding, because I think she was scared of the idea of celebrity,' he said, before adding that it was worth the wait.

'The fact the number one most-liked photo [on Instagram] has a kind of aesthetic was a win for what the mission is, which is raising the palette.

‘It was a long time,’ he added – drawing laughs from the audience.

The 
couple's wedding photo is the most-liked image to be uploaded to 
Instagram, with more than 1.93 million likes, and more than 35,000 
comments.

The image also revealed for the first time Mrs Kardashian West's exquisite wedding dress in all its glory.

Wedding details: Fans had to wait days for the couple's first official wedding picture to be released. And for the first time, Mr West revealed why during the panel discussion about technology and culture

The custom-made, Givenchy creation hugged her curvy frame perfectly, and featured long lace sleeves with strategic sheer panels, including a sheer back that incorporated some of the bride's signature sexy touch.

'Still feels like a dream!" she wrote on Twitter. 'Thank you @RiccardoTisci17 for making me the most gorgeous gown I've ever seen! I'm so grateful @givenchyofficial for this Givenchy Couture wedding gown!'

Wearing Givenchy proved to be a family affair as both North and Mr West were outfitted by Mr Tisci - who outfitted Mrs Kardashian West in a controversial dress for the 2013 Met Gala - for the special day.

North's custom-made, Haute Couture creation was made to resemble her mom's dress, while Mr West wore a custom tux.

During the panel discussion, which was moderated by Bloomberg News, Mr West also said that he believed his music video for Bound 2 was only accepted after he Mrs Kardashian West appeared on the cover of Vogue.

The singer explained that it was the endorsement of the fashion magazine which enabled the couple to be ‘understood’ after ‘two years of people not understanding an interracial relationship.’

From backlash to endorsement: Mr West also said he believes acceptance of his relationship with his new wife took two years - and the seal of 
approval from Vogue

He said: ‘You have to be able to take the lashes when people don’t understand.

'Two years of people not understanding an interracial relationship, two years of people not understanding the idea of the art world meets the pop world, you have to take the lash and be able to swim in the backlash.

‘I get bashed so much but create so much, just know that if you want to be a boxer you’re going to get your face beaten constantly but then you may end up being a Mayweather or an Ali at the end of the day.’

Mr West went on to discuss his now infamous video for Bound 2, which features his wife sitting topless on his lap while he rides a motorbike.

‘I still take a bashing for the Bound video. I always say that if Vogue had come out before the Bound video then everyone would have been like “oh, it’s okay” and that’s the endorsement,’ he said.

‘It took something established like Vogue to make everything okay and we had to wait. Like we had the wedding and then they were like "that’s cool now” because they were told by people who endorsed it.’

Mr West was in conversation with Steve Stout, Stephanie Ruhle and Ben Horowitz at a talk entitled Translation: Technology, Culture, and Consumer Adoption: Learning to Read the Cultural Landscape held at the Palais des Festivals.
