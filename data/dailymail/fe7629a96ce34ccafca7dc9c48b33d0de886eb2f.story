Swiss news agency claims Wolfgang Priklopil was killed by his best friend Ernst Holzapfel

Says handwriting specialist determined that Priklopil did not begin to write his 
suicide note, but that his friend may have done

Holzapfel was the last person to see Priklopil alive on the day of his death

The man who took Natascha Kampusch from a Vienna street when she was just a schoolgirl and kept her captive for nearly nine years in a secret dungeon - may have been murdered, it was claimed today.

Police always said Wolfgang Priklopil ended his own life by lying with his head a railway line when an express train came along in the hours after Natascha escaped his clutches in August 2006.

But a Swiss news organisation now claims his decapitated body was 'almost intact' after it was found by police - despite a grille at the front of the train that should have seriously mangled his body - and that his former best friend Ernst Holzapfel was suspected of being behind the death.

Traumatic: Natascha Kampusch was snatched from a Vienna street when she was just a schoolgirl and held by Wolfgang Priklopil for nearly nine years

The 20 Minute Website prints details 
of handwriting analysed by officials in Austria of Priklopil and 
Holzapfel and determined that Priklopil did not begin to write his 
suicide note - but that his friend may have done.

A
 2009 expert report stated; 'The comparison of the questionable word 
'mummy' with the available specimens of handwriting of Ernst Holzapfel 
furnished individual graphic similarities.'

Holzapfel
 knew of Natascha and often met with her when Priklopil brought her 
along to flats that the pair of them refurbished in Vienna for profit. 
He later told police he thought she was a girlfriend of his.

Doubts rasied: The grave of Wolfgang Prikopil, the man who abducted Natascha Kampusch, but there are questions of his death

Holzapfel was the last person to see Priklopil alive on the day of his death - August 23 2006.

They met at a shopping centre on the outskirts of the Austrian capital where, according to Holzapfel, his friend was distressed at Natascha's escape and the massive police hunt underway for him.

The former president of the highest court in Vienna, Johann Rzeszut, who served on a special Austrian commission analysing police failings into the Kampusch investigation, called the suicide note 'an extremely mysterious piece of evidence which questions the suicide thesis.'

He added; 'Doubts about the suicide theory are legitimate. I personally have them too. Holzapfel's version that Priklopil began to write to his mother and stopped after the word mummy is completely implausible to me.

'A 40-year-old man who wants to say good-bye to his mother writes at least or two sentences, in which he can say 'I am done with suffering' or 'thanks for everything' or something in this direction.'

He also questioned why the corpse of Priklopil - cremated soon afterwards - did not have its temperature taken at the time of death, or have blood removed from it, both of which are standard procedures at crime scenes.

Back in 2009 the Kampusch case chief investigator Franz Kröll said that the death looked 'staged.'

Captive: The entrance and stairway to the cellar where Natascha Kampusch spent so much of her life

His brother Karl told the Swiss news organisation; 'I believe Holzapfel had to get rid of the second culprit him because of things he might have said. My brother said that people who kill themselves do not put their heads on railway lines.'

Long suspected of being an accomplice in the kidnapping, Holzapfel was officially ruled out of assisting in her abduction and captivity by Austrian authorities in 2010.

His lawyers said he refused to comment about the new allegations swirling around him.

The Kampusch case and its aftermath constitute the greatest police and judicial scandal in Austrian criminal history.

A probe in 2006 found that there had been ‘massive’ police blunders and failures on the part of detectives which could have seen the girl rescued in the first few weeks after she disappeared.

The police investigation was flawed from the start, and many people felt that because she was an only child being being brought up on a sink estate outside Vienna, she had been forgotten by the authorities.

Since she gained her freedom she has written a book about her ordeal, become rich from media interviews and now spends weekends at the house where she was incarcerated.
