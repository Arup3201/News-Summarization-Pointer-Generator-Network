Leicester

Esteban Cambiasso and Ritchie De Laet are fit for Leicester after coming off in their 2-0 defeat at Crystal Palace last week.

Matt Upson is still sidelined with a foot injury, although he is making progress having not played for the Foxes since joining from Brighton in the summer.

Defender Zoumana Bakayogo, who was not listed in the squad at the start of the campaign, has had surgery on his anterior cruciate ligament injury and is expected to be out for the season.

Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Hamer, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Schlupp, Moore, Morgan, King, Hammond, Albrighton, Knockaert, Mahrez, Vardy, Taylor-Fletcher, Ulloa, Nugent, Wood, Drinkwater, Cambiasso, Simpson, Lawrence, Powell.

Nathaniel Chalobah is the latest injury casualty for Burnley as boss Sean Dyche prepares to take the Clarets to Leicester on Saturday.

Chalobah suffered a kick in the throat during an under-21 match on Tuesday night and will not be fit for the clash at the King Power Stadium.

Chalobah joins David Jones (thigh), Dean Marhey (hamstring) and Matthew Taylor (Achilles) on the sidelines as the problems continue to mount for Dyche's men.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Trippier, Lafferty, Ward, Duff, Shackell, Mee, Wallace, Kightly, Cisak, Sordell, Reid, Jutkiewicz, Boyd, Gilks, Keane, Long, Barnes, Arfield.
