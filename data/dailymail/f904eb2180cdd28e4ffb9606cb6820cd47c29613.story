This is the moment police arrested a woman after she allegedly went on a knife-wielding rampage, threatening neighbours and smashing up luxury cars outside her home.

The 43-year-old woman was Tasered and subsequently arrested after allegedly going 'berserk' outside her £220,000 home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands.

She allegedly threatened neighbours with a kitchen knife before causing thousands of pounds worth of damage to a number of expensive cars, including a Porsche, Jaguar and BMW.

Police were called to the Four Oaks area, which is home to several millionaires and Premiership footballers, following frantic reports from residents at about 10am on Saturday.

It is believed the woman's husband,  a doctor, was away with the couple's children at a dance class at the time.

One witness, who did not want to be named, said: 'It was a surreal situation. There were rocks and dirt from the plant pots on top of the cars and she was pacing around.

'I know that the bodywork of the Porsche and BMW cars were damaged particularly badly, and the back windows had also been smashed.

'The Jaguar XFs body also looked to have been badly damaged.

'One person ran in the house and there was damage to the front door.

'Obviously the kids were off school as it was a weekend and it's lucky nobody was injured. I don't know the people or even her name, but they have always seemed very pleasant and quiet.'

Jeremy Franklin, 34, who lives nearby, added: 'When police arrived she just wouldn't cooperate.

'After a little bit of shouting and nothing happening one of the officers I think was authorised to get the woman under control.

The incident occurred in the Four Oaks area of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, (pictured) which is popular with millionaires and Premier League footballers. Neighbours were said to be shocked by the alleged incident

'They fired a Taser, I don't know where it hit her but she went down like a sack of spuds.'

Another resident added: 'The woman just went berserk and came out wielding a knife. It was pretty scary stuff to be honest.

'She was trying to get into the home of a Chinese lady and stabbed at the door.

'My friend had his BMW damaged, he was gutted as he spent about £50,000 on it and it was his pride and joy.

'People are worried this might have an impact on the house prices around here.

'It might not be such a desirable place to live now after this but it's just a one-off thing.'

West Midlands Police confirmed the woman had been arrested in connection with the incident and sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983.

A spokesman said: 'Police were called to Crofters Lane just after 10.15am on Saturday to several reports of a woman in possession of a knife and damaging cars.

'A 43-year-old woman who was still believed to be armed with a knife, was Tasered after refusing to comply with officers' requests.

'She was arrested on suspicion of affray and has been bailed and sectioned under the mental health act.

'Several cars were damaged by no-one was hurt in the incident.'
