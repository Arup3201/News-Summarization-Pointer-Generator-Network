A family who lost a mother and baby within days of each other following an emergency C-section have spoken of their gratitude after the local community rallied around them in support.

Mother-to-be Christina Barton collapsed on October 16 in the bathroom of the family home in Springfield, Oregon.

At eight months pregnant, 28-year-old Ms Barton was rushed to Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend where she had an emergency C-section.

Ms Barton was found by her nine-year-old son. Her husband of ten years Steven Hunt told KMTR that when doctors told him that his newborn girl had a heart beat, he knew that his wife had died.

The young mother's cause of death is yet unknown.

He named the baby girl after his late partner. Tragically after four days on life support, baby Christina also passed away.

The heartbroken family said that they have been truly touched by the support from their local community who have offered donations for the mother and baby's memorials through a gofundme account.

Mr Hunt told the local station: 'I can't believe there's this much love in the world and it just keeps coming.'
