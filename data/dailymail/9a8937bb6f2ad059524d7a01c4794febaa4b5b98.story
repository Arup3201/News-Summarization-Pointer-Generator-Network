The home of New Hampshire Declaration of Independence signer Josiah Bartlett is up for sale after being in the family for seven generations.

The 18-acre property in Kingston offers a white 4,600-square-foot, four-bedroom farmhouse that was built in 1774 and has been updated through the years, plus open pasture and woods.

The front yard has a linden tree Bartlett brought back from Philadelphia as a sapling after signing the Declaration of Independence in order after John Hancock.

Sale: Ruth Albert, the great-great-great-great-granddaughter of Josiah Bartlett, the  former New Hampshire governor, and signer of  the Declaration of Independence poses in her home on Wednesday July 16, 2014 by the desk and under the portrait of Bartlett in Kingston, New Hampshire

'It's thriving on its own very nicely,' said Ruth Albert, the current homeowner and Bartlett's great-great-great-great-granddaughter.

The home's asking price is $849,900.

It's the first time the home, added to the National Registry of Historic Places in 1972, is for sale.

No other family members are available to purchase the property.

'It's very bittersweet,' said Albert, 63. 'I'm hoping that someone who loves history will like the house.' She had hoped that a historic preservation society might take it over and turn it into a museum, but after meeting with representatives from various historical groups in the state, she realizes the funding for such a project is scarce.

Little has changed in the house since the 1850s, when renovations were done to the kitchen. More recently, the couple added an upstairs bathroom.

Albert, who recently retired from her job with the U.S. Postal Service in Kingston, grew up in the house and has had fun through the years picturing her ancestors there.

She has lived in the home since the 1950s, but with no one able to take care of it she has had to make the decision to sell.

'I feel like it's my responsibility to make sure it goes forward with the best stewardship possible, and I feel like I have a little bit of say in the matter,' Albert said to WMUR.

She remembers her grandmother telling her she was lucky to have electricity as she did her homework; in her grandmother's day, it was candlelight and lanterns.

Albert and her husband, Dale, are planning to move to Florida, his home state, and live in a much smaller house.

Bartlett, a doctor and later governor of New Hampshire, moved from Amesbury, Massachusetts, to Kingston in 1750 to set up practice.

He married his cousin Mary Bartlett and they had 12 children.

Inspiration: Aaron Sorkin - who created the West Wing used Bartlett's name for his own character played by Martin Sheen

A plaque in front of the home describes Bartlett as a doctor, a statesman, a governor of New Hampshire and founder of the state's medical society.

One of his sons, Dr. Levi Bartlett, lived in the house, and it has stayed in the family ever since. Josiah Bartlett's medical instruments are displayed in the parlor.

His name might be recalled by fans of the TV series 'The West Wing': Martin Sheen played President Josiah Bartlet from New Hampshire.
