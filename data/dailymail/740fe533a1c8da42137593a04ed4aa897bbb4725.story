Vice President Joe Biden got aggressive while speaking about rape and sexual assault at a White House event on Tuesday.

The Vice President said that where he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, men acted when they saw a woman being assaulted.

'If a man raised his hand to a woman you had the job to kick the living cr*p out of him,' Biden told the audience, adding that what he just said wasn't very 'presidential or vice presidential' but 'something every man should begin to understand.'

Vice President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that where he comes from, 'If a man raised his hand to a woman you had the job to kick the living cr*p out of him if he did it.' Biden is pictured here on Monday at a college in Washington, D.C.

The purpose of the event was to discuss the recommendations of the White House's Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault and to announce the group's new website NotAlone.gov.

Among the task force's recommendations to schools are the reevaluation of what consent to sexual activity is and their adjudication process for determining if student's have been sexually assaulted.

Colleges and universities are required to investigate reports of sexual assault as part of Title IX in order to receive federal funding.

The White House task force's report, released today, says that schools sometimes subject self-proclaimed sexual 
assault survivors to 'harsh and hurtful' questioning about their sexual 
history.

At the event on Tuesday Biden announced the release of the first report of the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault and the group's new website NotAlone.gov

Acting in concert with today's report, the Department of 
Education will advise school's not to ask students about their sexual 
history with anyone other than his or her alleged attacker.

The Department of Education says 51 campuses currently have investigations open.

On Tuesday Biden repeatedly called on men to get involved in the sexual assault awareness campaign. Rape and assault will continue, he said, until society and men 'step up.'

'We're never going to solve this epidemic until we get men involved,' Biden said. 'They have to be part of the solution.'

During the event the White House played a powerful, new celebrity filled PSA featuring Biden, President Barack Obama, Steve Carrell, Seth Meyers and Daniel Craig, among other men, explaining what constitutes as sexual assault and that one sexual assault is too many.

'Rape is rape. Don't look away,' the Vice President encouraged listeners during the event. 'Do something. Speak up. Stand up.'

Biden also told the audience that everyone - men and women - have the 'God-given right' to live free from assault.

'It's cowardly. Simply cowardly to raise your hand to a woman or a child or a man who is smaller than you,' Biden told the audience.

Unless he is defending himself, 'No man has a right ever to raise his hand to a woman,' he said. 'It is assault.'
