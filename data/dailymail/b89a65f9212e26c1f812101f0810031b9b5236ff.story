Dave Lee Travis could face a stiffer punishment after his suspended prison sentence was referred to the Attorney General.

The office of the Government’s top legal advisor confirmed it is considering the sentence handed to the ageing sex pest after four complaints.

If senior Tory Jeremy Wright MP considers the three month sentence, suspended for two years, is ‘unduly lenient’ he will refer it to the Court of Appeal.

The twist will come as a further blow to the former Radio 1 DJ and Top of the Pops presenter who emerged from court unrepentant.

Travis, 69, accused the authorities of wasting ‘millions’ on the investigation into a string of allegations against him spanning several decades.

He said the single guilty verdict failed to prove he is a ‘sexual predator’ and has left him ‘mortified and disappointed’.

Travis was sentenced last Friday after a jury convicted him of molesting a 22-year-old researcher on the Mrs Merton Show.

The woman, now a successful TV personality in her own right, said she was 'subjected to an unprovoked and terrifying physical assault ' which left her 'paralysed with fear'.

Travis protested his innocence throughout the trial and tried to dismiss other women who claimed they had been groped by him as 'fantasists and liars'.

The star now faces being sued, including one from a woman who claims he attacked her when she was a 'pre-teen' in the 1970s.

Travis, who was tried under his real name David Griffin, was cleared of 12 indecent assaults dating back to the mid-1970s.

A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office confirmed: ‘The case has been referred to us under the unduly lenient sentence scheme.’

A decision must be made by October 24.
