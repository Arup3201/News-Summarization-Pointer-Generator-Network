Roberto Martinez has held talks with referees’ chief Mike Riley to outline his anger at recent decisions that he feels have cost Everton dearly.

Everton’s manager is not someone who will criticise referees after matches but he has felt the need to speak with Riley, the Head of the PGMO, twice in recent weeks, following a Barclays Premier League game against Manchester City and the FA Cup replay against West Ham United.

Martinez believes Andre Marriner made a number of errors at the Etihad Stadium on December 6, when Everton lost 1-0, while he was furious with an incident at Upton Park six days ago when Neil Swarbrick never gave Kevin Mirallas what appeared to be a clear penalty.

He insists talks with Riley have been amicable but Martinez has vented his frustrations, insisting mistakes – such as Craig Pawson’s failure to send off Newcastle’s Papiss Cisse for a clear elbow on Seamus Coleman – are happening too often.

Martinez said: ‘I have contacted Mike Riley about it. The two big decisions were against Manchester City really where there is no justification for those big calls – the red card for Mangala on Samuel Eto'o (that wasn’t given), the yellow card against Ross Barkley and the penalty (that wasn’t).

‘The (Mirallas penalty incident) at West Ham is even harder to take because it is the linesman who gives the free-kick and then the referee knows exactly where the action happened. We contacted Mike, but there's not much you can do on that. 

The Spaniard, on the touchline, has discussed recent contentious calls with referees' chief Mike Riley 

‘They accept there's been an honest error made, but there have been too many now. Referees are part of the game and the error of the referee makes the game what it is.

'It's tough to take when you've got six or seven big calls which didn't go your way and scorelines could have changed.’

Everton have only won one of their last 12 games. They should have too much quality to get dragged into a fight at the bottom of the table and Martinez wants them to make home form count, starting tonight against West Brom.

‘The next nine games we have at Goodison we cannot lose any points,’ said Martinez.

‘That is the aim. We are going to approach every home game like that. We know how difficult West Brom are. Tony Pulis is going to bring his own stamp on it but they have a very experienced group of players.

‘It will be a difficult game, but all the games we will face at Goodison we just feel we need to find a way to be the favourites and perform in a manner which will get us three points.’ 

Pulis, meanwhile, insists he has no problem selecting Saido Berahino against Everton despite his conviction for drink driving.

Berahino, 21, was disqualified from driving for a year and given a £3,400 fine after admitting the charge on Friday and faces internal discipline too.

But Pulis will keep faith in his star striker, who has scored six goals in his last three games and 14 for the season, despite insisting West Brom are not solely dependent on his scoring ability.

‘He will be in the squad,’ said Pulis. ‘I will have a chat with him if I feel it is necessary and if it’s not necessary I will leave it. He has been a good kid since I walked in through the door. He has been fine. He has to make sure he maintains that.

‘We have got other players who can score goals, other players who, if we don’t play Saido, will step in and put a shift in.

‘It certainly isn’t a one-man team in respect of how young and inexperienced Saido is.’

West Brom manager Tony Pulis will be desperate to keep hold of star striker Saido Berahino
