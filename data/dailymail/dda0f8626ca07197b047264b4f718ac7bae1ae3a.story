Harry Redknapp has backed owner Tony Fernandes' decision to restrict the QPR manager to loan signings in the January transfer window.

Redknapp praised QPR chairman Fernandes' approach and warned that flashing the cash would not guarantee Premier League survival.

The former Tottenham boss said Fernandes has already ploughed considerable funds into QPR, and will not countenance a repeat of the financial fallout from the club's 2013 Premier League relegation.

Redknapp expects to add one more loan striker to the signature of West Ham forward Mauro Zarate this month, and is not fazed by his inability to secure big-money recruits.

'I knew things were tight so it is no surprise,' said Redknapp on his chairman's frugal policy.

'We hold 18,000 people (at Loftus Road) so what can you do? You can't keep ask people to throw money in; they did their dough a few years ago.

'I understand the situation. It is good.

'We've got to be careful haven't we? I think we will stay up but if the worst comes to the worst you don't want to leave a situation where you are stuck with a load of players that you can't shift.

'I had to get rid of 15 the other year and we had to pay half of them up to go.'

Rangers face fellow strugglers Burnley at the weekend after beating them 2-0 back in December

Rangers face Burnley at Turf Moor in a crucial Premier League clash on Saturday, with Redknapp claiming a flurry of January signings is not always the answer.

'You can spend money and still not make a difference, it depends,' he said.

'It won't suddenly keep teams up, who knows? The bottom eight are the bottom eight anyway.

'There's seven or eight teams down there and the bottom three will come out of them.

'The teams above that will be too strong. Let's see who gets the best out of the players.

'If I can get a loan or two in now who can make a difference then I'll be delighted.'

Redknapp admits he has 'no idea' whether Adel Taarabt will still be a QPR player in February.

Boss Redknapp claims he still wants unsettled playmaker Taarabt to make a success of his time at Loftus Road, despite the pair's public spat in October.

Redknapp labelled Taarabt 'three stone overweight' in an extraordinary rant after QPR's 3-2 home defeat to Liverpool in the Premier League.

Taarabt posed for pictures to disprove Redknapp's claims, before chairman Fernandes ordered both to call a truce.

Taarabt has still featured just once for QPR this term, owing to a string of injuries, and Redknapp is still unsure on the Morocco forward's future at the club.

'No idea,' said Redknapp when asked if Taarabt would still be at QPR next month.

'If he is fit to play, wants to train and wants to play, then not a problem.

'Only Adel wants to help Adel. If he wants to get fit and wants to play then he can have all the ability in the world. He has to start producing.'
