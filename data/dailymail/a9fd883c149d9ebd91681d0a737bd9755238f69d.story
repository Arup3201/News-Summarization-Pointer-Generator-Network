A council boss who earned more than the Prime Minister has left her job with a £219,000 pay-off after being accused of bullying and claiming excessive expenses.

Andrea Hill, chief executive of Suffolk County Council, has quit the local authority after three years of controversy.

She repeatedly defied calls from the Government to take a 10 per cent pay cut – even though she earned around £75,000 more than David Cameron’s salary of £142,500.

The 47-year-old also faced criticism over her ‘domineering management style’.

A spokesman for Suffolk County Council said Mrs Hill had left the council following ‘lengthy’ talks.

The news was immediately welcomed by one of her leading council critics, Kathy Pollard, who said: ‘There will be a feeling of immense relief across the county.

‘It has been a very unhappy chapter in Suffolk’s history especially for those of us who voted against her appointment in the first place.

‘She introduced cuts but her position became more and more tenuous as she refused to take a pay cut herself - she was obviously not willing to share the pain with the rest of us.’

‘It is no secret that the public were very angry about her salary and hopefully there will be full transparency when her successor is appointed with clear salary guidelines - which was not the case with Mrs Hill.’

Today’s announcement, which came after a 90-minute meeting of the council’s dismissals appeals committee, follows increasing pressure on Mrs Hill to quit.

In a statement today, a spokesman for Suffolk County Council said: 'Following a lengthy discussion last Friday, and negotiations between representatives of both parties over the weekend, the county council can now confirm that Mrs Hill will be leaving her post with immediate effect.'

An independent inquiry was launched into both the accusations of bullying and excessive expenses claims.

The council’s dismissal and appeals committee met to discuss its conclusions.

The spokesman added: ‘Bullying and 
harassment allegations were robustly investigated. Although it remains a
concern that such a perception existed, the committee is satisfied that
there was no evidence to support those claims.’

"extended leave" to allow for the inquiry into whistle-blowing 
allegations to be conducted independently.

The council's discipline and appeals committee meets behind closed 
doors. The meeting is believed to have discussed the outcome of a report
prepared by independent investigators from law firm Wragge and Co.

July 1: The discipline and appeals committee meets once more.

July 4: Suffolk County Council confirms Mrs Hill will be leaving her post with immediate effect.

Regarding her expenses claims, the 
committee admitted ‘there were undoubtedly claims which, in the current 
climate, might not represent best use of public money’.

But it ‘accepted that there was no dishonesty’.

Two senior long-serving council officers resigned suddenly earlier this year, which was followed by the apparent suicide of the head of legal services, David White, who had worked for the council for more than 20 years.

An anonymous whistle-blower complained to councillors about Mrs Hill’s management style which led to a detailed investigation by a leading London law firm whose report was considered before today’s crunch meeting.

Mrs Hill had come to Suffolk from a similar job as head of Bedford county council.

But a little over three years later, under intense fire for her official life style - thousands of pounds of ratepayers’ money spent on ‘vanity’ portrait photographs, nights in luxury hotels and expensive ‘team building’ lessons - her reign is over.

A legal inquiry into claims by a whistleblower about Mrs Hill - which has cost thousands of pounds - formally ended last Friday when the council’s dismissals appeals committee met for five hours to consider its conclusions.

After weeks of negotiating between lawyers behind closed doors, the authority has agreed that Mrs Hill will leave - in her handbag a settlement agreement totalling £218,592.

She has been on extended leave since Easter at the Cambridgeshire home she shares with her husband Philip and their three children and will now be able to spend more time with her family.

Before she went on leave Mrs Hill circulated an extraordinary 1,800-word defence to council employees claiming her critics were motivated by envy and that she should be seen as a ‘role model’.

Instead, she said, she had been attacked by the media and political opponents, her children had been bullied, her friends pestered and her staff abused. She also alleged that some websites called for people to carry out ‘extreme acts of violence’ against her.

But there’s no triumphant legacy for Mrs Hill either - her controversial ‘New Strategic Direction’ policy lies in tatters.

The new council chairman, Mark Bee, moved swiftly last month with a promise to scrap large parts of its plan to hive-off services such as libraries, recycling and school crossing patrols.

But it was Mrs Hill’s six-figure salary which placed her among the highest-rewarded council chiefs in the country that angered many ratepayers.

Not only because it was awarded without the proper procedure, according to critics, but because it was topped up a payment of some £50,000 a year ‘deferred pay’ put into Mrs Hill’s pension pot.

By contrast the man she took over from, Mike More, had earlier announced he was giving up a £36,000 performance-related bonus, seemingly happy with his £200,000 a year as chief executive of Westminster City Council.

Mrs Hill stridently pointed out that she had turned down pay increases totalling £210 a week but would not consider any reduction in her current salary.

In an interview with the local paper’s local government reporter - who was blacklisted for exposing some of Mrs Hill’s spending follies - she insisted: ‘I do understand it is a big salary but I got the job in open competition.

‘Anybody in the country could have applied for it - in fact many people did and they were chief executives on similar salaries to mine.’

And while it didn’t impress librarians or lollipop ladies who were facing the sack at the time, Mrs Hill seemed proud that she had set a good example.

She said: ‘Actually I have taken a lead on pay restraint because I decided, quite by myself, to give up a pay increase of £5,000 and I gave up another increase in 2009 of over £6,000 so that’s £11,000 I have forgone.

‘I have considered that I have already given up two pay increases and I think that was the thing to do at the time and I won’t be taking another pay cut.’

What won the imperious Mrs Hill few friends was her adamant assertion that she was worth her huge salary because she was in 'a high-risk job.'

It prompted one angry ratepayer to write pointing out some might consider a young Suffolk soldier in the Royal Anglian Regiment fighting in Iraq on a tenth of her salary was the one in a real high-risk occupation.

Mrs Hill never replied or acknowledged the letter.
