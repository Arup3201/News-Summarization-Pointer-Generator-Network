Roughly three years ago, Gabriel Carrillo went to Men's Central Jail to discuss his inability to visit his brother there.

Instead, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy handcuffed him, took him to a break room with no windows or public access, and threw him against a refrigerator, court documents say.

His arm was fractured in the encounter and he received cuts to his nose and face, according to indictments unsealed yesterday. Afterward, four deputies tried to have him falsely charged with resisting an executive officer.

Mr Carrillo was detained for about five days and before he was ultimately released without charge.

Injuries: Gabriel Carrillo's face after he was 
allegedly beaten by deputies at Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles - a 
case which has led to the charges against 18 current and former jail 
officers for allegations of abuse

The case was one among many allegations announced by federal officials as they charged 18 current and former Los Angeles County sheriff's officials with beating inmates and jail visitors, falsifying reports, and trying to obstruct an FBI probe of the nation's largest jail system.

The investigation into corruption and civil rights abuses led to the arrests Monday of 16 of the 18 defendants. The 13 who were arraigned entered not guilty pleas. At least two no longer work for the department.

'These incidents did not take place in a vacuum. In fact, they demonstrated behaviour that had become institutionalised,' said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr.

Mr Carrillo, of Bellflower, Los Angeles, said he thought the officers wouldn't stop until he was dead.

'I’m
in a room with all these cops just beating up on me,' he told CBS Los 
Angeles. 'I blacked out and I thought the worst was going to happen, 
where I’ll just end up dying in there.'

'I thought the worst was going to happen': Mr 
Carrillo now. His attorney says the case was the genesis of an FBI probe
into abuse at Los Angeles County jails

Although he survived the ordeal, to add insult to injury, he was then slapped with charges of battery against his alleged attackers that would have carried a potential 14-year jail term.

'I've never seen such an outrageous abuse of the badge,' said Mr Carrillo's attorney, Ron Kaye. 'His hands were behind his back in handcuffs, he was visiting his brother, they sensed some disrespect from him and they decided to teach him some jailhouse punishment.'

Mr Kaye says Mr Carrillo's case was the spark which led to the probe into the abuse at Men's Central Jail, which has led to four grand jury indictments and one criminal complaint involving corruption and civil rights charges.

Flanked by some of his top command staff, LA County Sheriff Lee Baca yesterday told reporters that he was troubled by the charges and called it a sad day for his department.

He said the department would continue to cooperate with the FBI and that deputies who have been charged would be relieved of duty and have their pay suspended.

The Sheriff's Department oversees a jail system with more than 18,700 inmates and has a history of abuse allegations dating back to the Seventies.

These most recent allegations include:

vacuum': Andre Birotte Jr., U.S. Attorney, Central District of 
California, said the alleged behaviour which led to yesterday's charges 
had become 'institutionalised' in LA County jails

Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca takes 
questions from reporters: Sheriff Baca said yesterday he would accept 
the outcome of the FBI probe, but strongly denied suggestions abuse was rampant in his department

Those charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice include two lieutenants, one of whom oversaw the department's safe jails program and another who investigated allegations of crimes committed by sheriff's personnel.

They're accused along with two sergeants and three deputies with trying to prevent the FBI from contacting an informant by falsifying records to appear that he had been released when he had been moved to different cells under false names.

Attorney General Mr Birotte wouldn't say whether the lieutenant and two sergeants in the obstruction of justice probe were directed by their superiors or whether the alleged abuse was fostered by top brass at the department.

Sheriff Baca, who has been in the job since 1998, is facing his toughest race yet for re-election in 2014. He has acknowledged mistakes but also defended his department and distanced himself personally from allegations.

The sheriff said he has made improvements such as creating a database to track inmate complaints. He has also hired a new head of custody and rearranged his command staff.

Sheriff Baca said yesterday he would accept the outcome of the FBI investigation, but strongly denied criticisms that abuse was rampant.

'You haven't seen me retire from the job,' he said. 'You haven't seen me blame somebody else besides me for whatever the challenges are.'

The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Sheriff's Department in 2012, claiming the sheriff and his top commanders had condoned violence against inmates. The organisation released a report documenting more than 70 cases of misconduct by deputies.

The Citizens' Commission on Jail Violence, in its 2012 report, said deputies used force against inmates even 'when there was no threat at all,' and referred to 'a culture of aggression among some deputies in the jails.'

A federal jury in October found Sheriff Baca personally liable for $100,000 for failing to stop inmate abuse by deputies in Men's Central Jail in a case brought by a man who said he was severely beaten while awaiting trial.

In June, a two-year Justice Department investigation found deputies discriminated against blacks and Latinos by making unconstitutional stops, searches, seizures and using excessive force in the Antelope Valley.

Sheriff Baca disputed the findings but said he had instituted reforms.
