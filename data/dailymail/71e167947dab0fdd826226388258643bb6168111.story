Mystery: Leah Costa ran off with her boyfriend Christmas Eve--only he has been found

A 15-year-old Arizona girl police say ran off with her 17-year-old boyfriend on Christmas Eve was still missing on Sunday despite authorities have found the boy.

Leah Costa of Buckeye vanished with the unnamed boy December 24, according to her mother.

That boy was found by police wandering down a desert stretch of Interstate 10 near Tonopah on Saturday evening. 

His clothing was tattered and he was dehydrated and disoriented. 

He told police he wasn't sure where he and Costa had been or where police could find the girl.

The boy did tell police they'd been together at a dusty, rural TA truck stop near Tonopah--which may have been the last place he saw her.

Tonopah and Costa's home of Buckeye are separated by 25 miles of Sonoran Desert.

According to KNXV, the boy told police he and Costa had also been to the Burnt Wells Rest Area near the I-10 mile post 71 eight miles west of the truck stop. 

She was last seen wearing a blue and white plaid shirt, a black tank top, jeans and black shoes.

Leah is described as 5-foot-3 and weighs 187 pounds. She has brown hair and brown eyes.

She wears dark-rimmed glasses. 

Authorities are asking anyone with information to contact the Buckeye Police Department at 623-349-6400.
