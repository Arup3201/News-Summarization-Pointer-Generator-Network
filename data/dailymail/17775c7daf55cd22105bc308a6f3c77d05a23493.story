The age-old proverb states that slow and steady wins the race, and a tortoise proved that to be true once again when it beat a  rabbit which one would expect to come out on top.

Filmed at the Paws and Claws Pet Store in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, the video presents the two competitors lined up against each other as a woman shouts ‘go’.

Moving from their mark, the Russian tortoise named Herbert immediately gets its head down and begins walking in the correct direction.

The animals line up alongside each other and it initially appears to be no contest for the quicker rabbit

The dwarf bunny named Sven on the other hand becomes instantly distracted and hops off to the right.

Giving the rabbit a helping hand, a woman redirects it back onto the correct path and actually puts it into the lead.

Checking out the tortoise, the rabbit begins sniffing at its shell and the surrounding women can be heard laughing.

Undeterred by the tactics of its competitor, Herbert continues to storm forward and regains the lead as the rabbit once again tails off to the right.

Momentarily retaking the lead after a number of hops, the rabbit appears to finally have the upper-hand.

But after getting distracted once more, the tortoise regains its advantage.

The distracted rabbit sniffs the tortoise and attempts to put it off its stride but Herbert is undeterred

Going in the wrong direction, the rabbit well and truly surrenders any hope it had of winning.

And even with another helping hand from one of the women watching the race, the tortoise surges forward.

The video concludes with the rabbit disappearing from the shot as the relenting tortoise reaches the door and the women cheer in excitement.
