Many years ago, when major football clubs travelled by train, a London team set off on the long journey from Kings Cross to Newcastle. They observed the usual routine: they glanced at the back pages, played a few hands of cards and stared out of the window at the passing fields.

A friend of mine, a new signing, tried to prompt a conversation with some of his colleagues. A General Election was imminent, and he wondered how they intended to vote. The answers were depressing.

‘Not so much “Don’t Know” as “Don’t Have A Bloody Clue”,’ he reported. ‘Not one of them had ever voted, or ever intended to vote. They didn’t know which party was standing, or what they stood for.’

Andy Murray, here after winning Olympic gold, came out in support of Scottish independence 

In later years, he suspected that they had been telling him what he expected to hear, obeying the stereotype which insisted that sportsmen understand sport, but don’t trouble them with issues like life, death or politics. Yet he was taken in by the dim-witted image. And so was the rest of the country.

That patronising attitude has softened over time, as sports people at large have become more confident, more articulate. But the cultural branding has never quite faded. As Andy Murray could testify.

Murray had a view about Scottish independence. He was in favour. Now had he kept this view to himself, then all would have been well. But Murray, foolish fellow, tweeted his support for the Yes campaign. He went on to explain, in eminently reasonable terms: ‘It’s for the Scottish people to decide, and I trust them to make the right decision. I will support whatever the outcome is. Regardless of how it goes, I think it’s very important for everyone to come together and stick together afterwards.’ Too late; the damage had been done.

For Murray had committed the prominent sportsman’s cardinal sin: he had expressed An Opinion. He had thereby defied that offensive orthodoxy which insists: ‘Stay safe, hold your tongue, keep your head down.’ Retribution was swift, fierce and furious.

The standing army of online trolls erupted to order: ‘Traitor! … Ingrate! … Hypocrite!’ The abuse was raucous and predictably unoriginal. Then came the cheap derision, the ludicrous sneers:

How could a man who lives in a £6 million Surrey mansion advocate Scotland leaving the United Kingdom? As if his view would have been more acceptable had the mansion been worth ‘only’ £3m? And how could somebody who has apparently earned £8m in the past year so lightly turn his back on the nation which nurtured his talent?

Well, one imagines Murray is paying huge amounts of UK tax on those extraordinary earnings. And as for nurturing his talent, he is one of the most outstanding examples of a self-made athlete that modern sport has seen. He has given British tennis far more than he has ever received.

No, the current, wholly artificial, uproar stems from the fact that Murray endorsed the Yes movement. Had he called for rejection of independence, then there would have been the merest minimum of fuss.

But the fact that he thought the matter through, reached a conclusion, then made that conclusion public was deemed unforgiveable.

He now realises that his views only count when they coincide with those of his betters. His candour has cost him dearly.

In common with most people on this side of the border, I believe it was absolutely right that the Scots should have settled this matter for themselves. As it happens, I suspect that they reached the correct conclusion by their remarkable exercise in popular democracy. No matter. Murray disagrees, and his position was shared by 1,617,989 of his countrymen and women.

We now hear that part of the price he must pay is that a section of the Wimbledon crowd may withhold its support for the first Briton — and British he remains — to win the men’s title since Fred Perry.

One online sage, calling himself ‘Keith’, told the world: ‘I positively want the guy to be booed the minute he sets foot on court at Wimbledon.’

Cruel vengeance, thy name is Keith! And yet, daft as it sounds, there may well be some mutinous mumbling over the strawberries on Centre Court next summer. You see, being Scottish is a sin for which London SW19 has never quite forgiven the young man.

I have no doubt he will cope with such disapproval, as he has coped with just about everything which has been thrown at him over the past decade and more. But the fear is that the fuss will make him cautious, that the next time he has something to say, prudent silence may win the day. We must hope not, because Andy Murray is a distinguished sportsman, with interesting things to say.

We may not agree with his views, but they are honestly expressed and passionately held. And they deserve to be heard.

Yorkshire's white rage misplaced

A week ago in this space, I commented on the contentious dismissal of Nottinghamshire’s Samit Patel by Jonny Bairstow of Yorkshire.

Bairstow is a wonderfully enthusiastic, lavishly talented cricketer. But on this occasion, with Yorkshire working towards the victory which would deliver the County Championship, I felt that his action in waiting for Patel to lift his foot before whipping off the bails was within the laws yet outside the spirit of the game.

The emails from Yorkshire have been pouring in all week: affronted, irate, indignant. ‘Clueless’, was the kindest comment. Others spoke of ‘a hidden agenda against the White Rose county’. One claimed: ‘We know you hate all things Yorkshire.’ A personal favourite was the chap who described himself as an umpire in ‘a Senior Premier League’ and declared, without a trace of self-awareness, that he had had ‘occasion to reprimand’ me in the past.

Now it should go without saying that I haven’t a scrap of anti-Yorkshire bias; indeed, after the dazzling experience of the Grand Depart of this year’s Tour de France, my admiration for the county is more fervent than ever. But I have watched, repeatedly, the tape of that dismissal and I still believe that Bairstow’s actions were misjudged and that he may come to regret them.

Bairstow’s little fracas was followed by Andrew Gale, the Yorkshire captain, being charged with using racist and abusive language to Lancashire’s South African batsman Ashwell Prince in the Roses match on September 3.

The allegation is under investigation and a hearing will take place on Tuesday. All in all, these events conspired to take the shine off Yorkshire’s achievement in becoming county champions. Those who really do ‘hate all things Yorkshire’ will rejoice in their misfortune. The rest of us will find it rather sad.

Open and shut case for Troon to follow St Andrews 

And so it came to pass that in the month of September, in the year of 2014, women were finally deemed worthy of membership of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews.

It was as if the members had drawn back the curtains, peered out of the window and remarked to their good lady: ‘Funny thing, m’dear. If I’m not mistaken, that looks remarkably like the 21st century.’ Naturally, the people running the R&A were at pains to promote the historic nature of the decision. And since a great many of their number have never really been reconciled to female suffrage, then so it was.

Yet we must be fair; an endorsement of 85 per cent is a emphatic expression of intelligent values and the born-again radicals of St Andrews deserve credit. In fairness, the rest of the world will wonder why it took them 260 years to do something so blindingly obvious.

Rory McIlroy had set out the enlightened view with the heartening clarity of youth. ‘It doesn’t matter if you are a man or woman, black or white, everyone should have equal opportunities to do anything they want; whether to join a golf club, or get a job,’ he said.

The Royal and Ancient Golf Club in St Andrews voted to allow women to become members last week

And there can be no argument with his assertion.

But things cannot end there. It is plainly unacceptable that St George’s, Muirfield and Troon — three courses on the rota for staging the Open Championship — persist in excluding women from membership.

One of these, Troon, is scheduled to host the event in 2016. Quite clearly, after last week’s vote, such a prospect is inconceivable. If they cannot take the decent path — and they recently reiterated their opposition to civilised progress — then they must forfeit the prestige and financial benefits which The Open confers.

It really isn’t a difficult decision. And in this momentous week for modern Scotland, they would be following an excellent example.

P.S.

By and large, football administrators do not care for footballers. They see them as greedy, grasping, grossly over-rewarded individuals. Privately, they complain that footballers earn such exorbitant sums that they have become hopelessly out of touch with ordinary people. 

Last week, it was revealed that the Brazilian FA distributed presents to 65 administrators during the World Cup. It was a discreet gesture, scarcely worth mentioning. So nobody did. For they knew that nothing’s too good for the ordinary people. Not even a £16,000 wrist watch.
