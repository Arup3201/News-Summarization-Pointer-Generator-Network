David Tredinnick, who says astrology could help to heal the sick

The sick should turn to astrology for answers, a Tory MP has declared.

David Tredinnick said astrology had a ‘proven track record’ at helping people recover from illness and should be incorporated into standard medical treatments.

The MP for Bosworth in Leicestershire also admitted he had prepared astrological charts for fellow MPs – but refused to say who. 

‘I am absolutely convinced that those who look at the map of the sky for the day that they were born and receive some professional guidance will find out a lot about themselves and it will make their lives easier,’ he told MPs.

Speaking to the BBC this week he added: ‘I think it’s something that people should be aware of as an option they have if they are confused about themselves.’

However, he stopped short of suggesting that the NHS should provide astrological readings.

He attempted to pre-empt his critics, describing them as ‘bullies’ and declaring: ‘There is no logic in attacking something that has a proven track record.’

He also revealed that Chris Patten, Britain’s last governor of Hong Kong, had an official astrologer.

Mr Tredinnick is a member of two influential Commons committees, the health and science and technology committees.

He is also vice chairman of the Government’s herbal medicines working group.
