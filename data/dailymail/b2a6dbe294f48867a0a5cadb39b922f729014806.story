A mischievous father tired of Disney’s Frozen decided to have a little fun with his daughter by deliberately singing the words to a song from the hit movie wrong.

But his two-year-old daughter failed to see the funny side of his muddled version of ‘Do You Wanna Build A Snowman?’ and instead threw an epic tantrum.

This hilarious video shows Josh Ankney playing the trick on daughter Lila after enduring 'many, many' viewings of the hit movie.

Mr Ankney, from Michigan, ever so slightly changes the lyrics to the song – and it drives his daughter crazy.

'Do you want to see a snowman?' he sings, to which she quickly replies: 'No, build a snowman'. 

When he continues to mess up the words, she attempts to correct this 'mistakes' and when he simply laughs, it only makes her angrier. 

He posted the clip on YouTube, which has now attracted more than 600,000 views.

The 24-year-old said his family has watched the hit movie ‘many, many times’.
