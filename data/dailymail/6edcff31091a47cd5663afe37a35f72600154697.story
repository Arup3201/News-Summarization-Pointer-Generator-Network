As he arrived by helicopter to pick up his £200million super-yacht, the Aga Khan would have hoped he could have sailed off into the sun.

But as the 77-year-old, who is worth nearly £500 million, touched down at Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth, Devon, he was greeted by torrential downpours and choppy seas.

The 164ft luxury vessel, named the Alamshar after his retired Irish Thoroughbred racehorse, was commissioned in the 1990s and was destined to be the world's fastest yacht with a top speed of 70 knots (80mph).

Luxurious vessel: The £200 million yacht, the Alamshar, set sail from Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth, Devon, in torrential downpours and choppy waters 

Ambitious: Named after the Prince's Irish Thoroughbred racehorse, the yacht is 164ft long and was commissioned in the 1990s in the hope it might be the world's fastest super-yacht with a top speed of 70 knots (80mph). However it has been revealed it can only reach 45 knots

But the over-ambitious project has only just been completed and the leader of the world's 12 million Ismaili Muslims has been left with the fact it can only travel at a mere 45 knots (51.7mph).

Originally named Project 305 - it was hoped the Alamshar would break the world speed record for super-yachts as well as beat the transatlantic record he set - two days, ten hours and 34 minutes. 

Manufacturer: Babcock International Group  

Length: 164ft (49.9m)

Breadth: 36.7ft (11.2m)

Speed: Up to 45 knots (51.7mph)

Range: 700 nautical miles at speeds of 45 knots, 950 nautical miles at speeds of 35 knots and 1040 nautical miles at 15 knots.

Engine manufacturer: Pratt and Whitney (used primarily by the Norwegian Navy) 

Propulsion Machinery: Six gas turbines and 112 water jets

Built under a veil of secrecy by Babcock International Group, it was intended to be a superstar among super-yachts.

One source involved with the project told The Sunday Times that the Aga Khan was disappointed his dream could not be achieved following years of efforts. 

The project was mired but setbacks from an early stage. In 2008 during sea trials, it was forced to return to the docks as it could only travel at 35 knots (40mph).

According to a statement released by Babock and the Aga Khan, the project took so long because the mechanical targets were 'challenging'. 

It said: 'State-of-the-art shipbuilding and systems integration technology required to deliver the vessel to specification would have doubtless proved demanding even if employed in a commercial or military vessel.' 

Even though the speed has not reached its admired heights, guests on the boat will be given a comfortable ride, because of the gas turbine design. 

According to the manufacturer's website, it eliminates all mechanical vibration, and counters the effects of pitch and roll. 

In 1992, he managed to cross the Atlantic in a record two days, 10 hours and 34 minutes with another of his vessels, the Destriero. However, the speed of the Alamshar may mean he is not able to repeat that achievement. 

The Aga Khan, whose ancestors fled Persia for India two centuries ago, was born in Switzerland, and now spends most of his time in France, despite having British citizenship.

He inherited his title from his grandfather in 1957 and is believed by his followers to be 'the bringer of life'. 

In spite of his sometimes turbulent private life he remains revered for the worldwide charitable works he has directed funds to. 

He also owned the infamous racehorse Shergar, who was stolen by gunmen in Ireland in 1983 and never seen again. 

Arrival: The Aga Khan (pictured left at the 2013 French Derby ) is said to have flown to Britain in a private helicopter (right) to pick up his luxurious purchase

Slowed: The Alamshar was intended to be a superstar among super-yachts, powered by engines capable of blasting it to more than 70 knots. Guests will however enjoy a comfortable ride because of the gas turbine design 

Name of a champion: The super-yacht was named after the Aga Khan's retired Irish Thoroughbred racehorse. He won five of his nine races in a career which lasted from September 2002 to September 2003
