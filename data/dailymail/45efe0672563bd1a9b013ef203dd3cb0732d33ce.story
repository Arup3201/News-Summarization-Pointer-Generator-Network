A contestant on the upcoming series of The Bachelorette, Eric Hill, has died in a tragic paragliding accident.

The 32-year-old reality TV contestant was injured when his parachute collapsed and swung him into the side of a hill instead of away from it while he was paragliding at Point of the Mountain in Draper, Utah, on Sunday.

He had been in a coma in hospital, but lost his battle Wednesday, according to his sister, Karen Tracy.

Paying tribute on Facebook, she 
wrote: 'Eric shared his final journey with us this morning as all his 
immediate family were able to be at his side when he passed away.

'Thank
 you to all of your love and support and prayers and fasting. It was 
amazing to be with so many of his friends and family yesterday in the 
hospital who came to express their love for Eric.

'He
 gave us such a gift of a life fully lived and fully shared, and allowed
 us all to be a part of his last adventure here on earth.

'It
 is hard to think of life without his bright spark, but we know he is on
 to new adventures. We look forward to carrying on his legacy here and 
greeting him joyfully again someday. I love you so much, little 
brother!'

Beach date: Eric seen filming a beach scene with Andi on March 15; the show is mid way through filming and it is believed he had been eliminated from the show by the time Sunday's tragic accident occurred

Relaxed: The 32-year-old appeared comfortable with the Assistant District Attorney from Georgia as he took her on a date to Ventura Beach in his home state of California

Eric's father and his brother, Darren, had joined Karen at his bedside following the tragedy.

Eric had been a potential suitor for Andi Dorfman on ABC's The Bachelorette reality show, but is believed to have been eliminated at the time of his passing.

In paparazzi pictures taken while they filmed scenes for the show, Eric can be seen laughing with Andi on a date at Ventura Beach in his home state of California.

Experienced traveller: Eric was completing his GO with Eric charity trek, a challenge to visit every country in the world in less than 1,200 days, at the time of his passing

He appeared comfortable with the 26-year-old Assistant District Attorney from Georgia, and at one point reportedly flipped her in the air.In a still from the show, Eric is dressed in a smart suit jacket and a red tie as part of a group date, in which he and other suitors styled themselves after vocal group Boys II Men and serenaded Andi in Santa Barbara, California.

The Bachelor producers have also expressed their upset at Eric's passing.   In a statement to MailOnline, they said: 'We are deeply saddened to hear about the tragic passing of our friend, Eric Hill.

'Eric inspired us every day with his passion, his courage and his adventurous spirit, and for that we are very thankful.

'On behalf of our cast, crew and producers, we send our love, our thoughts and our prayers to Eric’s family during this difficult time.'

The adventurer had taken time out from his GO with Eric, The Global Odyssey charity trek, a challenge which saw him attempting to travel to every country in the world in less than 1,200 days to film the show in March.

Scene of the accident: A local news report by KUTV showed the terrain at Point of the Mountain in Draper, Utah, where Eric was paragliding at the time of his fatal crash

Safety first: Even though he was an experienced paraglider and had taken all necessary safety precautions, adverse weather caused the 23-year-old's parachute to collapse

'He
 experienced a partial parachute collapse, which swung him into the 
mountainside with some velocity,' Unified Fire Authority Battalion Chief
 Brian Anderton told KUTV. 'It doesn't seem like he fell an extremely 
long distance, but the velocity that he went into the hillside was 
enough to cause some trauma.'

According
 to a friend, Eric was an experienced paraglider and KUTV reports that 
he was often in Utah where the activity is widely popular.

'He's
 well experienced. He knows what he's doing,' the friend, Derek Mazur, 
told KUTV. 'Just kind of that time of year. Spring, the air is really 
rough and a lot of turbulence.'

Tribute: The adventurer's sister wrote a poignant Facebook message about how much he lived life to the full

But Brian warned that safety gear and experience aren't always a match for mother nature.

'Pay attention to the weather conditions and be familiar with what they're getting into,' he warned.

Eric had yet to achieve notoriety for his television appearance, but had made a name for himself online for his exploits as a world traveller.

In her tribute his sister, Karen, wrote: 'He gave us such a gift of a life fully lived and fully shared, and allowed us all to be a part of his last adventure here on earth'

For the project he dubbed The Global Odyssey: Finding Awesome in Every Country, Eric was determined to visit all 194 UN-recognized world countries in record time and by the time of the horrible accident he was well on his way.

Tragic: The Bachelor star Gia Allemand took her own life last year

Eric's death is a fresh tragedy for ABC, after last year's suicide of Gia Allemand, who had appeared in The Bachelorette's parallel show, The Bachelor.

The 29-year-old reality star was the second to last eliminated by pilot Jake Pavelka in the 2010 series and had been a very popular contestant with fans. 

She hung herself at her New Orleans home after arguing with her basketball player boyfriend Ryan Anderson on August 12.

Ryan discovered her and called 911, but although she was rushed to hospital she was taken off life support two days later. 

Paying tribute, Jake tweeted: 'I am in complete shock and devastated to hear the news about Gia. She was one of the sweetest people I have ever known.' 

Gia's funeral was held in New York City on August 22.
