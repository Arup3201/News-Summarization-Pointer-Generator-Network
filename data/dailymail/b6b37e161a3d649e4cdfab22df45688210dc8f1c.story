This is the dramatic moment workers ran from an engulfing dust cloud - moments after demolishing an eight-storey residential tower block.

A by-stander captured the  footage as Cornwall Tower in Hockley, Birmingham was brought crashing down by specialist contractors.

The video, taken by Sharon Boland, shows the huge block of flats being destroyed and four workers running as a dust cloud starts billowing towards them.

People can be heard gasping in the background as the building falls - and then laughing as they watch the workmen taking evasive action.

Billy Young, contracts manager for DSM Demolition Group, which carried out the controlled explosion, said: 'We were caught out a little bit by the high wind which was blowing down Heaton Street and four of us, including myself, ran away as it descended on us.

'However, there was never any risk to the safety of the public. 

'People who were watching were at a safe distance and were advised to turn their backs when the dust cloud reached them. It was a very successful controlled demolition.'

Cornwall Tower is one of eight tower blocks earmarked for demolition as part of a Birmingham City Council £26million housing demolition programme.

A council spokeswoman said: 'The purpose of the demolition is to improve the efficiency of council housing by removing properties with high future investment costs that will achieve savings. 

'It will also improve the effectiveness of council housing stock by creating opportunities for the development of new, affordable, high quality homes that better meet the current and future needs of the citizens of Birmingham and contribute to the creation of sustainable communities.

'Demolition of the existing buildings may also provide wider development opportunities, such as that for retail use or other neighbourhood facilities to be incorporated within the final use of the land.'
