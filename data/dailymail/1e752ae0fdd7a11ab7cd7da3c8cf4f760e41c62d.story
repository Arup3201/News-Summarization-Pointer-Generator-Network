The school run has long been notorious for being as much about what mothers wear as getting children to lessons, with three out of four saying that approaching the school gate is more stressful than going to work.

Not surprisingly, as the new school year draws closer, Google has reported a 40 per cent increase in searches relating to 'what mums should wear back to school'.

Now an article in the Sunday Times Style magazine has ratcheted up the pressure by revealing the underlying messages your clothes send to fellow mothers.

'It is nerve-racking,' Gillian Hornby, author of The Hive - a book about school gate cliques - told the magazine. 'People get quite fraught about it.'

Nerves are made worse by celebrity 
mothers such as Stella McCartney, Elle Macpherson and Claudia Schiffer -
all of whom invariably look perfect during the school run, no matter 
how much work they have on.

The school run has changed from what it was in previous generations,' explains Birmingham City University psychologist Professor Craig Jackson.

'It’s seen as being more hectic and there’s more vehicles on the road and more people driving to school rather than walking.

'It gives the psychological impression of being a more hectic period of the day.

So what does your style really say about you? According to London prep-school mother Holly, a pair of muddy trainers means a meltdown is in progress.

'Seriously, what you wear says whether you want to get involved in school life, how happy home is - and it's a huge deal.'

According
to Style magazine, a bouncy blow dry worn with dark sunglasses says 
'don't talk to me', while skyscraper heels tell fellow mothers that you 
can't be bothered to run after your child.

Meanwhile, odd combinations such as bed hair and a cocktail dress suggest that you aren't holding things together well.

'A big bunch of Prisoner: Cell Block H keys suggests somebody who will be high up socially,' adds Hornby.

'It somehow says "I'm in charge of a pretty big empire, with lots of doors and lots of cars."'

'Victoria Beckham may be able to carry off towering heels and mini dresses for her children's sports days and the school run. But for lesser mortals, comfort is usually key,' comments Daily Mail fashion editor, Eliza Scarborough.

'The key is to keep your overall look simple - a shift dress is far more relaxed when teamed with some flat pumps, chunky knits and a wide belt.'
