Killer on the loose: Saad Al-Hilli and his wife Iqbal from Surrey were murdered in France in 2012

Detectives investigating the murders of four people including members of a British family in the French Alps have ruled out a mystery biker seen close to the scene, it emerged today.

It was on September 5, 2012 that Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, and his wife, Iqbal, 47, died alongside her mother and a French cyclist.

The Al-Hillis' daughters, Zainab, seven at the time, and Zeena, four, survived the savage attack close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France.

The motorcyclist wearing a highly distinctive helmet was spotted nearby, and many felt certain that he would unlock the mystery of what really happened. 

But now it has emerged that he was ‘positively identified’ last month, and has now been ‘ruled out as the murderer’.

A legal source close to police in Chambery, who interviewed the unidentified man, said: ‘He was seen on a nearby road within minutes of the murders, but it took many months to track him down.’

The man is from Lyon, eastern France, and was paragliding in the Alps during particular warm weather. 

‘He is no longer considered suspicious, but may be re-interviewed over what he may have seen around the area,’ said the source. 

It was in 2013 that the police finally issued a photo-fit image of the motorcyclist, and this is thought to have helped identify him.

The latest development is a huge setback for Eric Maillaud, the prosecutor leading the enquiry, who has already admitted that those responsible may never be caught.

Conceding that the enquiry could go on for years to come, Mr Maillaud said last year: ‘We have tried everything possible, but perhaps we’re in the presence of the perfect crime.’ 

Murders: The Al-Hillis died alongside Mrs Al-Hilli's mother and a French cyclist, while their two young daughters survived the savage attack close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France

Mrs Al-Hilli died next to her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, while local cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, was killed by a hail of bullets before being dragged along the ground and crushed by a car.

There have been claims that Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, of Chessington, Surrey.

Zaid Al-Hilli was arrested in 2013 under suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because he has a watertight alibi.

Eric Devouassoux, a 49-year-old old former policeman from the Annecy area, also spent four days in custody over the killings in February.

The gun collector is still being investigated for arms trafficking, but there has been no legal action linked to the four murders.

There are also well sourced claims that cyclist Mr Mollier may have been the intended victim due. 

He was linked to a multi-million pounds fortune through his relationship with an heiress. 

Zainab and Zeena, the surviving daughters, are now in the care of members of the Al-Hillis' extended family.

They have been given round-the-clock security because those responsible for the murders are still at large.
