Frantic 911 calls made seconds after a Navy fighter jet crashed into a retirement community reveal the frantic reactions of those who had just witnessed the plane fall out of the sky.

The two-seater F-18 jet crashed into the Mayfield 
Mews apartment complex, about a mile from the Atlantic Ocean and 
Virginia Beach, on Friday, after suffering a 'catastrophic 
mechanical malfunction' during a training flight.

The plane plunged into an apartment 
building, destroying at least three buildings and damaging more than 65 of the housing units - but incredibly no-one was killed.

As nearby residents rushed to the burning wreckage to try and help, others made calls to the emergency services to ask for rapid response.

One caller pleads for assistance: 'Oh my God - all those old
people. Oh my God, you need to hurry up and get help here. There's a 
terrible fire - oh my God, something's exploding... The whole thing is 
on fire.'

'Hello, yes we've just had a jet 
explode on Birdneck' says one caller, leading the incredulous operator 
to double-check what he has heard.

'A what explode?', he asks. 'Do you know if anybody is injured?'

'I have no idea, the place is on fire, I don't know - get everyone up here,' she pleads.

One caller says she keeps calling and 
calling, but no-one has arrived yet - except the pilot, who is sitting 
on her porch. She says: 'There's no-one here, there's the pilot waiting on my patio.'

'The pilot is on your patio?', the operator replies, with a quick double-take.

'Yes and no-one's here and I keep calling and calling and there's no-one answering.'

The pilots ejected from the plane and are credited with 
saving lives by dumping their fuel seconds before impact.

Concerns: There are no known fatalities from the dramatic crash, but three elderly residents who lived in the apartment block are unaccounted for

As the plane still burns, the 911 operators deal with more and more calls for assistance.

As one caller complains how long it 
takes to get through, the 911 operator responds: 'Ma'am, we've got 47 
calls in the queue to be answered.'

Another caller witnessed the plane as it struggled to keep control. He told the operator: 'A Navy plane just went down on 24th 
Street.

'I saw the pilot bail out, he did bail out - but it hit the 
apartment complex. The apartment building is on fire. The apartment 
building is completely destroyed.'

Five civilians, as well as the two 
pilots, who were a student and an instructor, were taken to hospital to 
be treated, but their injuries were not serious and all but one, a 
pilot, had been released by Friday evening.

Three elderly people were unaccounted for in the hours after the crash, but everyone had been accounted for by Saturday morning.

Fire department spokesman Tim Riley said three
buildings were destroyed, and two more had significant damage.

Dr.
Thomas Thames of Sentara Norfolk General Hospital told WAVY-TV that six
people were brought to the hospital, including the two pilots.

Two 
people were treated for smoke inhalation, one fainted at the scene and 
the other person was a police officer hurt at the scene, he said.

The Navy said that 
the jet was an F/A-18D assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 106 based at 
Naval Air Station Ocean. It crashed shortly after 
takeoff at a site near the base at about 12:05 p.m.

Bruce Nedelka, the Virginia Beach EMS
division chief, said that it seemed like the pilots were dumping the 
jet’s fuel prior to the crash.

That action likely prevented a 
massive fireball upon impact, he said.

‘He mitigated what could have 
been an absolute massive, massive fireball. With all of that jet fuel 
dumped, it was much less than what it could have been.’

George
Pilkington also witnessed the disaster, and told CNN the timeline of 
events, 
describing a few large explosions after the initial crash. He said: ‘It 
was emptying out fuel and the tail end was down. They (the crew members)
must have ejected before they came down.’

Mr Pilkington also said the engine sounded like it was ‘straining and stressing’.

One witness said that when the 
pilot came down he was still strapped to his ejector seat and had to be 
pulled out of the wreckage - when he immediately said sorry for the 
crash.

Retired Virginia 
Beach rescuer Pat Kavanaugh said: ‘He apologised very much for 
hitting our complex and I told him: "Don’t worry about it, everything’s 
going to be fine".

‘I 
checked him over, did a body survey, he was in shock, still strapped to 
his seat so we picked him up, dragged him to the other side of the 
parking lot away from the fire.'

Naval Air Force Atlantic spokesperson Cmdr. Phil Rosi told the website that both aviators safely ejected from the plane.
