Ikea's definition of affordable varies dramatically according to the country it is operating in

Ikea presents itself as the champion of affordable home furnishings.

But it appears that the store’s definition of affordable varies dramatically according to the country it is operating in.

British families are being charged about 70 per cent more for some items of furniture compared with their counterparts on the Continent.

A snapshot survey of popular Ikea items – from armchairs and sofas  to a chest of drawers and a rug – found that, on average, customers in Britain are paying more for exactly the same product.

For example, Ikea’s popular Friheten corner sofa bed costs £525 if bought in its British stores – some 71 per cent more than the £307 charged in Poland, and also considerably more than the £344 in Spain and Germany.

The sofa is also cheaper in Ikea’s home country of Sweden – renowned for its relatively high cost of living – where it comes in at £400.

A similar pattern is seen on items including the Äpplaro gazebo, which costs £250 in the UK, versus a cheapest figure of £158 in France. It is £205 in Poland and £215 in Spain and Germany.

The price differences were not  consistent and in some cases British families were paying less, which suggests shopping at Ikea offers something of a geographic lottery in terms of value.

On the face of it, the prices tend to be lower in countries with lower wages and living standards, however this does not always hold true.

Across the eight items surveyed, the UK total cost of £2,215 was higher than the £2,038.60 for Germany and £2,177 in France.

It was some £467 – 26.7 per cent – more than the £1,748 total in Poland, and £380 more than Spain’s £1,835. The findings echo a pattern seen in the past among brands of perfume and beauty products, designer clothes, trainers and cars sold globally.

It will also fuel the belief that  multi-national companies view Britain as a ‘Treasure Island’ where they can get away with higher prices and bigger profits.

And it can be hard enough getting an Ikea flatpack home in the car, let alone on public transport, so it’s unlikely many Britons will be  popping over to Warsaw to collect the store’s cheaper wardrobe.

While in opposition, Lib Dem Business
Secretary Vince Cable made government failures to tackle higher UK 
prices a campaigning issue.

Any suggestion that Ikea, which is hugely successful and profitable, is charging more in the UK risks alienating shoppers here.

However, the company, supported by several retail analysts, suggested the gaps have more to do with the relatively high cost of doing business in Britain.

Professor Jeremy Baker, a marketing expert at the ESCP business school, said: ‘Ikea looks cut-price but it is a rich Swedish "category killer" which exploits its position. 

‘It is ruthless on the business side.’

He added: ‘A price is based on three separate factors – cost, what the customer will pay and what the competition are charging. Ikea wins in terms of what the customers will pay and it beats the competition.

‘People are seduced by the domestic atmosphere and the impression of value in its stores. Of course the company will charge what it can get away with.’

He said the cost of doing business is higher in Britain versus countries like Poland and also suggested our welfare state effectively props up prices here. 

This is because benefits guarantee a certain level of income, meaning retailers can get away with charging more in Britain.

Prof Baker said it would be wrong for the British to believe that the higher prices we pay are some kind of badge demonstrating a better quality of life.

‘Poland is full of smart hard-working people, and we Brits kid ourselves if we think we are superior.

Not any longer,’ he said. Richard Perks of analysts Mintel rejected the idea consumers here are victims of a rip-off culture, and also argued the raised prices are more likely to be the result of higher business costs.

‘Furniture retailers have driven down prices to survive – and many haven’t,’ he added.

‘Ikea is unquestionably very competitively priced. It has that end of the market to itself because all the other furniture retailers are so frightened of it.’

Leigh Sparks, professor of retail studies at the University of Stirling, said prices will also fluctuate depending on what was selling well in each country.

An Ikea spokesman said: ‘Low price is the cornerstone of the Ikea vision, and we will always remain focused on giving our customers the best value for money.

‘Prices are set once a year and are subject to a number of factors in each country, such as VAT, exchange rates, corporation taxes, wages, energy and transportation costs, which impact on the actual cost of offering that product in each country where Ikea operates.

‘We guarantee our customers in the UK the lowest prices in the market with a substantial price distance to the competition.’
