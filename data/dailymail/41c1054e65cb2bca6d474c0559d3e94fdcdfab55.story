Three kids were pictured hitching a ride on the back of a subway car  on Monday evening and some people claim to see a spooky skull in the photo.

The children were on the back of an uptown express train leaving the station at 96th Street  around 6pm, in a photo shared with Westsiderag.

It may have been a 2, 3 or 5 train that was leaving the Upper West Side station.  

Three kids were seen clinging to the back of an uptown express train leaving the 96th Street station on the Upper West Side at about 6pm on Monday evening 

The man who took the photo, Sean Futterman, said the skull image may have just been a trick of the light

It is odd the image was spotted on the same day Lorraine Ogarro of the Bronx fell to her death on the tracks

A concerned commuter, Sean Futterman, snapped a photo of the kids and sent it to the West Side Rag. 

Futterman, a real-estate broker in Manhattan, yelled at the kids to get off the train, PIX 11 reported. 

The children responded with laughs and curses as the train sped off. 

No police officers were in the station at the time, according to Futterman.

He said the skull image in his photo is could just be a trick of the light, but did admit to noticing  'something strange underneath the subway car'. 

MTA official Kevin Ortiz was shown the photo.

After seeing it, he said: 'Stupidity knows no bounds.' 

Earlier in the day, a 54-year-old woman who was trying to move between subway cars was hit by a train after she slipped and fell to the tracks below.

Lorraine Ogarro of the Bronx was on a 1 train headed downtown when she fell off near the 207 Street station in Inwood around 10.30am, according to the New York Post. 

She was pronounced dead at the scene.
