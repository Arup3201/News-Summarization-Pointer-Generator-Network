A courageous shopkeeper has told how he fought off a gun-wielding robber from inside his store using only a small wooden stick.

Kapil Vaghela was confronted by a masked raider who burst into his convenience shop in Leicester before firing at him and his petrified fiancee.

But rather than cower as the gunman ran amok in his shop, the 29-year-old store owner refused to hand over his takings and instead fought the robber with a nearby stick.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Bravery: Mr Vaghela, armed only with a small wooden stick, prods at the masked gunman to keep him from getting away with the contents of his shop's till

Terrifying: The robber can clearly be seen pointing a firearm in the direction of Mr Vaghela, who remains unmoved in the face of danger

Dramatic CCTV footage of the incident last Wednesday night showed Mr Vaghela defiantly facing the robber as he fired three shots at him and his partner Trisha Patel, 27.

The stunned newsagent realised he had not been injured and managed to see the intruder off after guessing he had fired blanks.

Heroics: Shopkeeper Mr Vaghela modestly played down his bravery, insisting he simply wanted to protect his store and his fiancee

Mr Vaghela has since played down his heroics, insisting he just wanted 'protect my fiancee and the business I've worked so hard for.'

He said the gunman had barged into the store demanding the contents of the till, apparently believing he could 'take whatever he wanted'.

Mr Vaghela said: 'I tried my best to stay calm, so I pressed the panic button and sat down and picked up the stick and started prodding him with it.

'He kept trying to get to the till and he shot the gun three times. The first time I thought he had missed me.

'But then he aimed it right at my leg and fired it. I reached down and realised I wasn't injured and thought 'he's firing blanks', so I kept fighting.'

The masked gunman ended up leaving the store empty handed after Mr Vaghela's brave intervention.

The shopkeeper added: 'I think he thought he could walk into my shop, show the gun and take whatever he wanted. I don't think he expected me to fight back.

'I don't think I was especially brave but I decided I wasn't going to let him steal from me.

Wanted: Leicestershire Police have since appealed for information about the raider, who burst into Mr Vaghela's store wearing sunglasses and with a hood over his head

The gunman had fired a weapon at Mr Vaghela, but the shopkeeper escaped injury as it's thought the gun contained blanks

'I'm definitely feeling good because I was able to protect my fiancee and the business I've worked so hard for.'

Detectives have appealed for the public's help to trace the robber. Officers have taken the shell casings for analysis.

The suspect was wearing a grey full-length smock coat with its hood pulled over his face, and large sunglasses.

They believe the weapon was gas-powered and have stressed that these could be fatal if fired into someone from a short distance.Â
