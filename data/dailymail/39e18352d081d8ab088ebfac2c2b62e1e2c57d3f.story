Students at a Washington college have launched a petition to save a rare $250,000 Dodge Viper, likening the decision to scrap the car to losing a beloved family pet.

The automotive students at the South Puget Sound Community College were told the 1992 model must be destroyed, after car manufacturers Chrysler deemed it no longer has any educational value.

Professor Norman Chapman told ABC News: 'It's like taking a family pet, putting it in front of kids and destroying it.'

Consigned to the scrap heap: The rare Dodge Viper was donated to a Washington college for educational purposes but manufacturer Chrysler now wants it scrapped

The car was donated to the college eight years ago by Chrysler, to enable students to use the car as part of their studies.

'We destroy cars all of the time, but that's usually because they have lost their educational value,' Mr Chapman said.

'This here is kind of unique and the students are definitely up in arms about it. It has around 600 horse power and it will go 200 mph really easy. It's definitely a race car. There are no frills in it, but it's definitely a speed machine.'

The college were told of the decision by email this week. The message simply told school officials that Chrysler plan to 'eliminate all Dodge Vipers from its educational donations fleet'.

The manufacturer has given the school two weeks to scrap the car, and has requested proof that it has been scrapped.

The car is also used to attract high school student's to take up the college's courses.

'It's a much beloved car on campus,' Dean of College Relations Kellie Purce Braseth said.

But students have launched a petition to try and save the car, and have it installed in a museum.Â

Prof Chapman said it is unlikely the campaign will prove successful, unless the students gain presidential pardon, or the state's governor's support.

Chrylser said while they do preserve many models for historic purposes, the Viper does not fall into this category.

The college said they do not know the reason for the order, but added Chrysler are within their rights to order the car's destruction, under the terms of a contract signed when the car was donated.

Prof Chapman said there were rumours circulating that similar cars had 'got loose' at other schools, and had been involved in accidents.

A Chrysler spokesman said it is 'standard procedure' as part of the donation process for the company to order cars be destroyed.

He said whenever cars are donated to colleges, they are done so on the basis that they are scrapped once they no longer offer any educational value.

The statement said: 'With advancements in automotive technology over the past decade, it is unlikely that these vehicles offer any educational value to students.

'Chrysler Group has no record of any 
legal proceedings involving Dodge Viper vehicles donated to educational 
institutions being involved in accidents and product liability 
lawsuits.'

The Viper in question was the fourth off the production line and one of the first hardtop models to be made.

The car is so rare, Jay Leno once tried to buy it from Chrysler. But the presenter was told they could not sell it to him because it is not street legal.
