Thomas Vermaelen is unwilling to sign a new contract at Arsenal, edging him a step closer to the exit door.

The Gunners captain’s contract expires at the end of the forthcoming season and the club had been keen on offering him fresh terms.

But the Belgium defender does not want to open talks about extending his deal.

On his way out: Thomas Vermaelen is unwilling to enter negotiations over a new contract at Arsenal, increasing the likelihood he will leave the Emirates this summer

Strong interest: Manchester United, Barcelona and Napoli are among the clubs interested in signing the Belgium defender, though Arsenal would prefer to see Vermaelen move abroad

Unless Arsenal sell him in the current transfer window, it means the central defender can sign a pre-contract agreement with an overseas side from January.

The Gunners do not want to sell their captain this summer, but also want to avoid the possibility of losing him for nothing next year.

Barcelona, Manchester United and Napoli all have a firm interest in Vermaelen.

Arsenal would prefer to sell Vermaelen abroad rather than to United, which will prove a difficult stumbling block to overcome for Louis van Gaal.

Acceptance: Arsene Wenger is resigned to the fact Vermaelen will soon be moving elsewhere

Bid: Louis van Gaal is keen on taking Vermaelen to Manchester United and the club had a £7m enquiry turned down earlier in the summer

VIDEO Van Gaal happy with squad  

The Gunners snubbed an initial £7million enquiry from United earlier this summer.

And with Arsenal expecting Barca to make their move for Vermaelen in the coming days, the Belgian’s future could come to a head sooner rather than later.

Vermaelen missed Sunday’s 1-0 Emirates Cup defeat by Monaco with a hamstring injury, and it seems unlikely that he will play for the club until his immediate future is resolved. Midfielder Abou Diaby is also being managed through a hip complaint.

Radamel Falcao scored the winner for the Ligue 1 club at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.
