David Cameron has boldly declared that Britain’s mission will be ‘accomplished’ in Afghanistan by the time troops pull out next year – and that it should never again become a haven for terrorists.

Appearing to dismiss fears that Taliban militants will return to wreak havoc, the Prime Minister, making what is set to be his last Christmas visit to British bases in the country, gave a startling upbeat assessment of the troubled country’s prospects 13 years into the conflict.

Asked by reporters if the troops come home with ‘mission accomplished’, Mr Cameron said: ‘Yes, I think they do. I think they can come home with their heads held high.’

Support: Mr Cameron said when troops leave Afghanistan at the end of next year they will return to Britain with their 'heads held high'

Mission: Prime Minister David Cameron, met British soldiers at Camp Bastion, outside Lashkar Gah during his traditional Christmas visit to troops

The Prime Minister insisted that the 
main aim of the mission, which has claimed 446 British lives, was to 
give the country ‘a basic level of security’ against terrorism, and he 
said he was confident this had been achieved.

His
 remarks risked comparisons with the notorious ‘Mission Accomplished’ 
speech given by former US president George W Bush about Iraq in May 
2003  after Saddam Hussein’s regime had been overthrown, only for an 
insurgency to take hold which claimed thousands of lives.

Standing
 on the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln, Mr Bush declared that 
;in the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have 
prevailed.’

While the 
president did not utter the infamous phrase ‘mission accomplished’, he 
made the speech against the backdrop of a huge banner bearing the 
slogan.

Echo: Mr Cameron's remarks drew comparisons with US President George W. Bush's speech aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in 2003, declaring that it was 'mission accomplished' in Iraq

The incident came to
 represent the failure of the United States and Britain to adequately 
prepare for the initial invasion and toppling of Saddam Hussein's 
regime.

Mr Cameron, by contrast, did concede that allied forces will ‘not leave behind a perfect country or a perfect democracy’. 

‘Afghanistan
 is an extremely poor country with a very, very troubled history, but 
the purpose of our mission is to build Afghan security forces that were 
capable of maintaining a basic level of security so this country never 
again became a haven for terrorist training camps, and I think the 
Afghan security forces are capable,’ he said.

'That
 has been the most important part of the mission. Now it's also good 
that there are six million children in school, including two million 
girls. It's good that Afghanistan now has far better health services 
than it ever did ten years ago, it's good that here we are in Helmand 
with elected district governors and basic levels of governance and 
services that didn't exist before.

'All
 these are important but to me, but - and the National Security council 
said this very clearly - to me the absolute driving part of the mission 
is a basic level of security so that it doesn’t become a haven for 
terror. That is the mission. That was the mission and I think we will 
have accomplished our mission so our troops can be very proud of what 
they have done.'

All combat
 troops will be pulled out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014 – with 
numbers serving in the country already reduced from the peak of 9,500 to
 round 5,200 by Christmas.

Mr
 Cameron said the timetable for withdrawal would not change depending on
 the security situation, saying ‘we are sticking to that track.’ In June
 this year the Afghan National Army and security forces took over 
responsibility for security across the country  with British forces in a
 supporting and training role.

Festive: Mr Cameron joined soldiers for breakfast at Camp Bastion, where the mess was decked out for Christmas

Fry-up: The PM helped himself to bacon and eggs alongside serving soldiers

Michael
 Owen let the Prime Minister pull rank when it came to choosing which 
bunk bed to sleep in as they flew out to Afghanistan together, the 
footballer has revealed.

The
 pair shared a small cabin on a C-17 military transport plane during the
 eight- hour journey from Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to Camp Bastion.

Owen told reporters: 'I obviously let the PM choose first. He chose top. I was quite surprised myself.

'I
 couldn't hear anything. I was wondering if he was going to snore but I 
couldn't hear anything with the noise up there and obviously you can 
hear the pilots all the time.

'So, let's say it wasn't the best of sleeps, but who's to complain? We were in the best place.'Mr Cameron later praised his flight companion: 'Well, he's charming. He's a very nice guy.'

He
 added that since he took office in 2010, ‘what we've done in that time 
is train up a hugely capable Afghan National Army and police force now 
numbering almost 350,000 and I think more than capable of providing the 
basic level of security that this country needs.’

Military
 personnel are concerned that violence may erupt in the weeks running up
 to the Afghan elections on April 5 when current president Hamid Karzai 
will hand over to a successor for the first time since 2001. Most of the
 troops coming home next year will only be pulled out in the summer 
after the elections are over.

British
 military figures admitted that while the Afghan security forces were 
performing well and the insurgency had been far weaker this year than in
 previous years, militants may still target candidate and election 
officials.

One military 
source said: ‘The campaign here is on track and the Afghans are in a 
good place in the short, medium and long term.

'The insurgency will have a
 go, they will still be having goes next year at electoral officials but
 against the very credible and capable Afghan National Security Force. 
At the moment the insurgency are just trying to regenerate and 
reorganise for the next phase.’

Mr
 Cameron also had lunch with troops on the frontline and sent a ‘Bluey’ –
 a letter from the Armed Forces postal service -- telling the forces: 
‘You should be proud of what you have achieved here in Afghanistan.

‘It
 has been a long road and we have suffered losses but your work is 
building an Afghan army and police force that can keep this country safe
 and keep our country safe too.’

Strategy: Mr Cameron was briefed by British army officers at the forward operating base Sterga II at Helmand province in southern Afghanistan

Meeting: Mr Cameron was joined by former England footballer Michael Owen during the trip., where they discussed a match at Wembley between England and Afghanistan

Asked
 whether Mr Cameron was seeking to echo former President Bush’s 
announcement of the end of major combat  operations in Iraq in front of a
 banner reading ‘mission accomplished’, the Prime Minister's official 
spokesman pointed out that the words were initially introduced by a 
journalist to whose question he was responding.

‘I think it's understandable. He was asked a question, he answered in the way he did,’ said the spokesman.

The
 spokesman added: ‘The Prime Minister was explaining what the armed 
forces have achieved.  Is the situation in Afghanistan a perfect one? As
 the Prime Minister himself has said, No.

‘But
 has the situation improved significantly in terms of the threat that 
the terrorists posed? - because that's the reason we intervened. Yes, it
 has and that is as a result of the  achievements of our armed forces.’

The Prime Minister backed a plan for the England football team to play the Afghan national side in a landmark 'peace match' at Wembley Stadium to mark the end of the conflict.

He was in Camp Bastion with England legend Michael Owen, who had a kickaround with troops to launch a major new partnership between the FA and the Afghan Premier League.

David Cameron said a symbolic football match when troops return home next year was an 'excellent idea'.

He said: 'I’m sure that there will be many very dignified national events that should take place...but the idea of one part of it being a football match I think is a very nice idea.'

The match is reminiscent of the truce match played between England and Germany during the First World War. They played in No Man's Land at Christmas 1914 and the match between British and Afghan troops is likely to take place around the centenary.

Mr Owen said it would be a 'fantastic occasion'. The footballer who retired last season after 14 years in the game, said: 'In the association the Afghan FA have with ours, I think there's the opportunity for them to come over and train at our national centre St Georges Park and  there could be a fully fledged game at Wembley one day - that would be fantastic to mark the occasion.

'They are big into their football and big into the Premier League so I think they would be welcomed. It would a fantastic occasion. I don't know what the politics would be, but it would be great to mark the end of the conflict with a game certainly at Wembley.'

He is one of the Football Association's 150 ambassadors. Robert Sullivan, head of corporate affairs at the FA said the match was a 'long term ambition'.

Mr Cameron, who watched troops play a team from the Afghan National Army, said: 'I think football has an immense ability to bring people together, bring countries together and as we leave Afghanistan we are not leaving it alone in the world.

'We are going to go on funding its Armed Services, we are going to go on supporting its development. We are going to be helping it have a football league.'
