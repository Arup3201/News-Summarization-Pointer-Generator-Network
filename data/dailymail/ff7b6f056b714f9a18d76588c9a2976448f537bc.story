Loretta Macpherson, 65, died shortly after she was given a paralyzing agent typically used during surgeries instead of an anti-seizure medication

A 65-year-old cancer patient who died unexpectedly in an Oregon hospital was fed the wrong drug by a pharmacy worker, officials claim. 

Loretta Macpherson, 65, died shortly after she was given a paralyzing agent typically used during surgeries instead of an anti-seizure medication.

It was one of several mistakes revealed on Monday that killed the mother-of-two, who had gone to the emergency room at St Charles Medical Center in Bend following brain surgery to remove a tumor.

According to Michel Boileau, chief clinical officer, Mrs Macpherson had been correctly prescribed fosphenytoin to stem seizures, and the medication was successfully delivered to the hospital.

However, an internal investigation showed a pharmacy worker filled the IV bag labeled 'fosphenytoin' with a paralyzing drug: rocuronium.  

Mrs Macpherson, from Oregon, stopped breathing and suffered cardiac arrest and brain damage on Wednesday.

Macpherson came into the ER two days earlier with medication dosage questions after a recent brain surgery. 

Her son Mark Macpherson told News 21 his mother was taken off life support and passed away Wednesday.

She was recovering after having a brain tumor removed at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle last month. 

'Very speedy recovery, she was expected to make a full recovery,' her son said who explained he had move near her to help with her care.

'She was doing very well.'

He said she worked as an interior designer for 25 years in Newport and before that, she worked as a clerk in Salem, where her late husband, Gordon Macpherson, had served as a state representative.

'She was the most amazing person on the planet,' Mark McPherson said.

 'There wasn't a person that she didn't get along with. Everyone loved her.' 

Macpherson would not confirm whether he's planning legal action against the hospital, and instead said he wanted to make sure the experience was not repeated for anyone else. 

Three employees involved in the error have been placed on paid leave. 

The organization is conducting an investigation, but doesn't yet know how the error occurred.

The hospital notified the Deschutes County district attorney, who did not immediately return a call for comment.

Deschutes County District Attorney Patrick Flaherty told NewsChannel 21 in an e-mail Thursday that, as in all accidental deaths, 'the law required a death investigation. 

'However, I did not and am not requesting an autopsy, because there is no question about the cause of death.'
