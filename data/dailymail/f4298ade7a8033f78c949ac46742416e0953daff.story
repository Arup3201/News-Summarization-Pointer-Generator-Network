A Pittsburgh man was 'screaming in pain' after he set himself on fire  while drinking moonshine and trying to light a furnace in his basement, according to police.

The man, who has not been named by authorities, was standing outside his North Side home when fire crews arrived at at 2:45 a.m. Tuesday.

Neighbors identified the man only as 'Tony' and said that he was screaming in pain because his legs had been burned so badly.

Moonshine: The man admitted that he was making the booze in his house

The neighbors said they knew the 30-year-old through family and that he was highly intoxicated.

Pittsburgh Police Spokeswoman Sonya Toler said: 'He told a neighbor that he started the fire when he was drinking moonshine and trying to light his furnace.'

Firefighters worked quickly to extinguish the small blaze and the man later admitted that he had been making the illegal booze in his house. 

The man is being treated at UPMC Mercy hospital's burn unit for third-degree burns to his legs.

UPMC Mercy is a main hospital facility of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center located in the Uptown section of the city of Pittsburgh.

Arson Investigators are still looking into the exact cause of the fire. But no charges are expected to be filed, according to KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh.
