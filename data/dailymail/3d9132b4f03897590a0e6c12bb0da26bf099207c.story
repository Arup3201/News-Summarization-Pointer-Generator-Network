The fabulously wealthy Aga Khan has finally divorced his second wife after a ten year legal battle - paying her £50million.

The 77-year-old British citizen is most often in the public eye thanks to his racehorses, yet is the spiritual leader of the 12 million members of the mystical Ismaili sect of Islam.

His lengthy court fight with third wife Princess Gabriele zu Leiningen, 50 - who was previously married to a minor European prince and is herself distantly related to the British royal family - has been excruciatingly embarrassing.

The Aga Khan, spiritual leader to millions of Muslims, has finalised his 2011 divorce from German princess Gabriele Renate Inaara Zu Leiningen, after years of legal dispute

Lawyers for the Aga Khan and his ex-wife (pictured) released a statement on Friday saying their marriage 'ends by consent' after the Paris Court of Appeals approved a divorce settlement

The couple started divorce proceedings in 2004

While some believe he is a direct 
descendent of the Prophet Mohammed, and many of his adoring followers 
give him a share of their earnings, the divorce battle has seen him 
being accused of having an affair with an air hostess.

So
 he must have heaved a huge sigh of relief on Friday when a Paris court 
made its final decision on the case behind closed doors.

And
 although the payout is a French record, and five times an earlier 
settlement made in Paris before it was appealed, many commentators 
believe the Aga Khan has got off lightly. Some had predicted the divorce
 could end up costing him £500m.

The
 divorce case had begun in London before switching to France, where 
settlements have never reached British or American heights.

Bitter split: The Aga Khan and his wife were divorced in 2011, but only now have proceedings been finalised and he has to pay the £50million ordered by a French court

The
 Aga Khan, whose ancestors fled Persia for India two centuries ago, was 
born in Switzerland, and now spends most of his time in France, despite 
having British citizenship.

He
 inherited his title from his grandfather in 1957 and is believed by his
 followers to be 'the bringer of life'. In spite of his sometimes 
turbulent private life he remains revered for the worldwide charitable 
works he has directed funds to.

His
 first wife was British model Sally Croker-Poole, who he married in 
1969. They had two sons and a daughter. Eldest son Prince Rahim, 42, is 
expected to be his official successor.

That
 first marriage ended after 25 years, and he married Princess Gabrielle 
in 1998 at his huge Aiglemont estate, near Paris. She is a German former
 pop singer who converted to Islam for her marriage, and adopted the new
 name of Inaara.

The couple had a son, but after six years announced their separation.

In
 the course of their highly publicised break-up it has been claimed that
 the estranged wife hired surveillance experts to prove her belief that 
her husband was having an affair.

There have more recently been reports that the Aga Khan is considering marrying for a third time.

When
 the Parisian Court of Appeals finally approved a secret agreement 
between the couple on Friday, lawyers for both side refused to comment 
on the reputed £50 payout for the Princess.

The
 Aga Khan's vast wealth allows him to run a £100m yacht, named Alamshar 
after one of his racehorses. He also owned the infamous Shergar, who was
 stolen by gunmen in Ireland in 1983 and never seen again.
