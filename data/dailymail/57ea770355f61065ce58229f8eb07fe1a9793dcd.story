Depraved militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq are attaching high-definition cameras to the barrels of their guns in order to film barbaric executions in gruesome detail.

The shocking pictures were captured by the terror group's Tigris River branch, who are currently engaged in fierce battles with up to 30,000 Iraqi Army soldiers and Shia militia roughly 70 miles north of the ISIS-held city of Tikrit.

Still images from the video shows a group of blindfolded prisoners being forced to their knees while heavily armed militants line up behind them. The photographs then cut to the gun barrel cameras, which display in graphic detail the young men being shot to death from point blank range.

The unorthodox camera view and the use of HD equipment give the footage the appearance of a computer game and is just the latest example of ISIS attempting to portray their atrocities in a manner that could appeal to young men and women living in the West.

The horrific images have been shared online by Arab-language supporters of the brutal terrorist group.

They show a group of men being dragged before a baying crowd of local men, who gather along a roadside and use mobile phones to film the shocking scene.

The victims - who wear Western-looking clothing and have their hands bound behind their backs - are forced to their knees by the bearded militants, who tower over them while wearing military fatigues.

One jihadi stands behind each of the five victims, brandishing all manner of guns - from what appears to be small .9mm handguns to massive AK47 assault rifles.

At least one of these larger weapons has an HD camera attached and captures in gruesome detail the horrific moment a bullet hits one of the prisoner's head, causing blood and brains to spray into the air.

The next image is a close-up shot of the five victims lying in a pool of their own blood while bloodthirsty onlookers stand and cheer, raising their fingers in the air in a symbol of religious devotion.

Professional: The photographs  carry the distinctive yellow branding of ISIS' propaganda wings, suggesting they may be stills from an as-yet unreleased propaganda video

It is understood that the group behind the savage murder represent ISIS' presence along the River Tibris, which flows from southern Iraq into Turkey, passing through regime held cities such as Baghdad, as well as the militant stronghold Mosul and current frontline city Tikrit.

It was not immediately clear where the images were taken, but this particularly ISIS group typically operate in and around the remote villages off Iraq's Highway 1, such Azwya and Al-Shirqat.

The photographs are high quality shots and carry the distinctive yellow branding of ISIS' propaganda wings, suggesting they may be stills from an as-yet unreleased propaganda video.

The victims are believed to be a group of local men accused of attempting to organise an anti-ISIS resistance group, although this information has not been independently verified.

The shocking use of cameras attached to gun barrels is just ISIS' latest attempt to portray life under the terror group as similar to a video game. 

The approach is believed to make an effort to make their atrocities more palatable and possibly even appealing to a generation of Westerners raised on graphic shoot 'em ups that portray human life as cheap, and even reward and encourage users to commit cold-blooded murder.

This morning Islamic State group militants in the north of Iraq set oil wells ablaze in an attempt to foil government forces battling to reclaim territory.

A bomb ripped through an outdoor market in the Baghdad suburb of Nahrawan, killing three civilians and wounding 12, a police officer said. Another bomb targeted a military patrol in the northeastern district of Rashdiya, killing three soldiers and wounding seven, he added.

Mortar shells hit a residential area in the southern district of Dora, killing two civilians and wounding six, another officer said. An explosion in a market in Mahmoudiyah, 20 miles south of Baghdad, killed three civilians and wounded seven.

Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have thrown yet another young man  to his death from a building after accusing him of being gay.

Stomach-churning photographs show a large bloodthirsty crowd gathered at the foot of a multi-storey building in the group's de facto capital Raqqa to watch the murder of the young victim.

With the baying crowd clambering on to rooftops to get a better view of the savage scene, the blindfolded man is dragged to the roof of the tallest building in the neighbourhood by bearded militants, who use mobile phones to film him being barbarically thrown to his death.

The images were released by local activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, who work undercover in the ISIS stronghold to expose the terror group's atrocities. 

The photographs carry the distinctive yellow logo of ISIS' propaganda wing Al Hayat Media Centre, suggesting they come from an as-yet unreleased video of the savage murder.

The photographs shows a huge crowd gathering at the foot of a run-down building in the west of the city, which ISIS captured in early 2014 amid the ongoing chaos of the Syrian Civil War.
