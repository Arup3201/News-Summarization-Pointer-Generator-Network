Michigan police are under investigation after photos and videos allegedly showing officers harassing and humiliating African-American men surfaced.

The pictures and footage were alleged to have been shared between members of Grosse Pointe Park police and their families.

They were released on a blog written by a former Detroit Free Press reporter on Thursday, who says he received them from an anonymous source.

An officer has been suspended after claiming responsibility of the videos that show black men being told to sing and make animal noises

Steve Neavling wrote in his Motor City Muckraker blog that most of the videos appeared to have come from patrol cars, and that African-Americans were ordered to sing or 'dance like a chimp'

He also published an image of a man riding in a trailer, that an officer allegedly forwarded to others in a text that read: 'Got to love the coloreds'.

According to the Huffington Post, Neavling had access to more footage, but said he wasn't willing to make it public because of its 'humiliating nature'.

Several officers are alleged to have been involved in the demeaning videos, but the blog named only Mike Najm as an officer who may have taken some of the images and videos.

According to the Huffington Post, Officer Najm's ex-wife may have distributed the material.

Grosse Pointe Park Captain David Loch had been skeptical of the claims at first, saying that the Najms had been through a contentious divorce.

But when he was shown more of the films and images, including footage of Office Najm allegedly telling a man with learning disabilities to sing, he ordered an internal investigation.

Neavling reached out for comment from Officer Najm but didn't receive a response.

The police said they opened an internal investigation after viewing the video clips and photo.

A spokesman added: 'The Grosse Pointe Park Public Safety Department does not tolerate unprofessional conduct by its officers when interacting with any citizen they may come in contact with.'
