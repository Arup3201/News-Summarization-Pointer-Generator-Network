A former American Apparel store manager is accusing the racy clothing company's CEO of 'rubbing dirt on his face' amid a string of verbal and physical abuse and then firing him without a reason.

Michael Bumblis, 24, of Inglewood, California, has filed a lawsuit against Dov Charney, claiming the boss 'abused his position and power and, in doing so, flaunted employment laws.'

Mr Bumblis was hired in March 2009 and rose up the ranks to eventually manage one of the retail stores in Malibu before he was sacked on July 24.

In the suit, filed in a Los Angeles court on November 29, the former worker is alleging assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of civil rights, discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation and religious affiliation and wrongful termination.

According to ABC News, Mr Bumblis claims he became 'increasingly agitated and anxious at work, was unable to fully concentrate and was increasingly absent from work due to his anxiety and distress.'

Mr Charney has a 'well known, long and unenviable reputation for aggressive, violent, erratic, inappropriate, and harassing behavior towards others, including (American Apparel's) employees,' the documents state.

Mr Bumblis alleges that the 43-year-old who 'periodically' visited the store 'usually on an hour's notice' threatened him on one of their first encounters after greeting him at a February convention in Las Vegas while he was standing next to an unnamed woman.

In April, Mr Charney called him and 'launched into an expletive ridden diatribe,' the young man claims, and asked if he was 'banging that girl you were with in Vegas.'

According to the suit, Mr Charney said: 
'You should have been ****ing fired months ago,' and abused him for 
being Jewish and gay, though Mr Bumblis says he's neither.

The former staffer says on another occasion, Mr Charney came to the store he managed to inspect construction work and, after the pair allegedly quarreled about a new inventory system, 'dove' at him.

He says the boss 'grabbed' him around the neck with both hands 'and began to forcibly squeeze (his) throat in an attempt to choke or strangle' him.

During the same visit, Mr Bumblis claims Mr Charney called him over after spotting some dirt in a space between a fitting room wall and the store wall, saying, 'Come here! Look how disgusting you are.'

He allegedly told him: 'Rub it on your face,' before proceeding to 'scoop up the dirt and forcibly attempt to rub the dirt on plaintiff's face,' the suit claims.

The company has denied the allegations and highlighted that the former employee signed a gag order as part of his contract.

'The allegations in this lawsuit are false and Mr Bumblis and his lawyers know that any complaints the company may have against Mr Bumblis, or complaints he may have against the company, are to be addressed in binding arbitration, not in the media or the courts,' Mr Charney's lawyer Peter Schey said in a statement to ABC News.

'In addition to the conduct that led to his termination, Mr Bumblis has also violated his written agreement to arbitrate any disputes with the company. We will shortly initiate arbitration against Mr Bumblis and have no doubt that the court will require that he join the arbitration proceedings where we expect the company's claims against him will be upheld.'

Mr Schey insists Mr Bumblis was fired for 'reasons fully consistent with company policy.'

American Apparel employs about 10,000 people worldwide with around 5,000 based in Los Angeles.  It operates over 285 retail stores in 20 countries and is well known for its use of young models in its racy advertising campaigns. 

The lawsuit comes as the company has again fallen foul of the advertising watchdog with campaigns featuring 'gratuitous' images and the sexualisation of models who appeared to be under 16.

The clothing brand ran into similar issues with campaigns in 2009 and earlier this year but it responded to the two separate, latest, complaints by saying 'it was standard practice to market hosiery, intimates or lingerie in the way done on their website'.
