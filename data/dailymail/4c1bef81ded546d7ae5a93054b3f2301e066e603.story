 A pain-racked woman was rushed to hospital by her family and told she was just an hour from death - after being told she was a non-priority by the ambulance service.

Lindsay Bowker, 30, was screaming and doubled over with chronic stomach pain when her mother Wendy dialled 999 - only to be told she would have an hour-long wait.

Lindsay did not realise she was actually seven weeks into an ectopic pregnancy and was suffering heavy internal bleeding after her fallopian tube ruptured.

After losing two litres of blood her mother drove her to hospital herself where she underwent emergency surgery and doctors said she was lucky to be alive.

Medics told the mother-of two she was an hour from dying - the length of time she would have waited for the ambulance.

Lindsay, of Chorley, Lancashire, who sadly lost her unborn baby, said: 'I was in the house on my own and I was hit with this instant pain.

'It was absolute agony and I immediately fell to the floor.

'I’ve had two babies and it was worse than both labours put together.'

Lindsay called her mother Wendy, 53, who was out walking her dog and she phoned for an ambulance.

Lindsay added: 'They told my mother I wasn't a priority so it would be about an hour until an ambulance would arrive.

'My mother arrived about ten minutes later and could see how much pain I was in.

'I was screaming so she phoned 999 again and told them how urgent it was.

'They would have been able to hear my screams in the background but they just said the same thing.'

After waiting around 30 minutes for an ambulance, Lindsay’s brother arrived with the car and her mother Wendy rushed her to Chorley Hospital.

Lindsay said: 'It was a nightmare. I had to lie across the backseat of the car with the windows open and I was screaming the whole way because of the pain.'

After arriving at Chorley Hospital last Tuesday, Lindsay was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital in an ambulance, where they rushed her into emergency surgery.

'As soon as I arrived they gave me a scan and said they could see lots of blood,' Lindsay said.

'They said they had no option but to rush me straight into surgery.

'They thought it was an ectopic pregnancy but they didn’t know my fallopian tube had ruptured until they operated.

'They put a camera through my belly button and had to remove my fallopian tube when they saw what had happened, so sadly I lost the baby.

'Afterwards, they told me I had lost two litres of blood and would have died if I had waited any longer.

'The surgeon said he’d never worked so fast in his life and said ‘you’ve just had life-saving surgery’. It was incredibly scary.'

Lindsay was given a blood transfusion and was kept in hospital for three days before being discharged.

Lindsay, who is now recovering at home, praised staff who treated her but the family have made a formal complaint to Chorley MP Lindsay Hoyle regarding the ambulance service.

Lindsay, who has two daughters aged seven and 12, added: 'I can’t thank the hospital staff enough.

'I don’t blame the ambulance staff either but something needs to done.

'I could have died and I don’t want what happened to me to happen to anyone else.

'To go through all that and then find out I’d lost my baby all in one day was something I wouldn’t want anybody else to go through.

'I’ve lost all faith in our ambulance service.'

North West Ambulance Service said it told the family the patient may have to face a wait due to it being busy.

A spokesman said: 'We understand that waiting for an ambulance can be distressing for the patient and their family and we are sorry that in this instance, the patient’s family is not happy with the service received.

'When received, all 999 calls are categorised within the control rooms, based on the information given by the caller, to ensure patients are assessed on the basis of their medical need, with those with immediately life-threatening conditions taking priority.

'In this instance, due to high levels of activity, the family were informed of the possibility of there being a wait for a response and took the decision to make their own way to hospital.

'If the family would like to discuss this incident with us, we would urge them to contact us directly so we can respond to their concerns.'
