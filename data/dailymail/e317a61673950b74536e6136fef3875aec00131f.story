A new poll has found anti-Semitic views are rising in America.

A nationwide survey released today by the Anti-Defamation League found that 15 per cent of adults – nearly 35million adults – hold deeply anti-Semitic views, an increase of three per cent from a similar poll conducted in 2009.

Experts say old stereotypes about Jews and money appear to be more widely accepted among Americans as the downturn in the economy persists.

Prejudice: A nationwide survey found that 15 per cent of adults - nearly 35million - hold deeply anti-Semitic views

The 2011 Survey of American Attitudes 
Toward Jews in America, a national telephone survey of 1,754 adults, was
conducted October 13-23 by Marttila Strategies of Washington, DC and 
Boston. 

The survey shows that at a time of high unemployment and economic 
uncertainty, age-old myths about Jews and money and Jewish power in 
business endure, with a surprising number 
of Americans agreed with sharply worded criticisms of Jews.

Over the last decade, the highest 
level of anti-Semitic attitudes was reported in 2002, when an ADL poll 
found 17 per cent of Americans harboured anti-Jewish attitudes.

Nineteen percent of Americans answered
'probably true' to the statement: 'Jews have too much control/influence
on Wall Street' - an increase from 14 per cent in 2009.

The survey found 14 per cent agreed with the 
statement 'Jews have too much power in the U.S. today' - an increase 
from 13 percent in 2009.

Research: In the 11-question survey a surprising number of Americans agreed with sharply worded criticisms of Jews

And 15 per cent agreed that Jews are 'more willing to use shady practices' - up slightly from 2009.

Sixteen per cent agreed that Jewish 'business people are so shrewd, others don't have a chance' - up from 13 per cent in 2009.

Thirty per cent believe that Jews are 
'more loyal to Israel than to America,' 'a percentage that has remained 
virtually unchanged since ADL's benchmark survey in 1964, despite the 
changing make-up of the U.S population', according to the organisation.

Anti-Semitic propensities are measured by an 11-question index developed by the Anti-Defamation League more than 40 years ago.  The index includes 11 statements used to gauge the anti-Semitic attitudes of the respondents.

In the new survey a surprising number of Americans agreed with sharply worded criticisms of Jews:

'Nearly half' of all respondents 
agreed with the statement that Jews 'stick together more than other 
Americans', and 33 per cent said they believe Jews 'always like to be at
the head of things'.

Thirty-one per cent of Americans 
agreed with the statement 'Jews were responsible for the death of 
Christ; and one-quarter of Americans believe that Jews 'still talk too 
much about what happened to them in the Holocaust'.

ADL National Director Abraham H 
Foxman said: 'It is disturbing that with all 
of the strides we have made in becoming a more tolerant society, 
anti-Semitic beliefs continue to hold a vice-grip on a small but not 
insubstantial segment of the American public.'

'The stereotypes about Jews and money 
endure, and the fact that more Americans are now accepting these 
statements about Jews as true suggests that the downturn in the economy,
along with the changing demographics of our society, may have 
contributed to the rise in anti-Semitic sentiments,' said Mr Foxman. 
'Once again the old anti-Semitic standbys about Jewish loyalty, the 
death of Jesus and Jewish power remain strong.'

According to the ADL poll, the most 
educated Americans are largely free of prejudicial views.  Less educated
Americans are more likely to hold anti-Semitic views. 

The poll found that 22 per cent of who
graduated high school or completed some high school harbour strongly 
anti-Semitic views, as compared to 13 per cent among those who completed
some college, and nine per cent among those who graduated from college.

The poll also looked at anti-Semitic 
views among significantly large minority groups. It found that Hispanic 
Americans born outside of the U.S. are more likely than Hispanics born 
in the U.S. to hold anti-Semitic views.  According to the survey, 42 per
cent of foreign-born Hispanics hold anti-Semitic views, as opposed to 
20 per cent of U.S. born Hispanics.

In 2011, 29 per cent of 
African-Americans expressed strongly anti-Semitic views. That 
percentage is consistent with the findings of past surveys.

Jews were found to be held in high 
regard on many key measurements, however.  Even Americans who hold the 
most anti-Semitic views agreed with many positive statements about Jews.

Seventy-nine per cent said they 
believe Jews have a strong faith in God; sixty-four per cent said they 
believe Jews have contributed much to cultural life of America; and 83 
per cent say they emphasise the importance of family life.

The survey was conducted with a base 
sample of 1,200 plus an oversample of 243 African-Americans and 227 
Hispanics, bringing the oversample for both communities to 400 each.

Ancestry.com, museum release Nazi victim records

Records on more than 30,000 victims of Nazi persecution during the Holocaust are now available on Ancestry.com from collections of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.

The searchable records announced Thursday are part of the World Memory Project. The museum and Ancestry are collaborating to build the world's largest online database of information on Holocaust victims.

The World Memory Project aims to make the museum's 170 million documents easily searchable for free online.

Building the database relies on volunteer contributors who are indexing historical records. Project manager Lisa Yavnai says the effort has made more records available than the museum could have produced alone in years.

Curators say the museum holds records on at least 17 million people targeted by the Nazis.
