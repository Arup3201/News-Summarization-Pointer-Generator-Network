The father of two toddlers who died after a dresser fell on them is facing involuntary manslaughter charges because he heard a crash and didn't immediately check on his daughters, a prosecutor said on Thursday.

David Beatty, 28, of Aliquippa, is charged in the deaths of 2-year-old Brooklyn and 3-year-old Ryeley. Brooklyn died shortly after the dresser fell on her on July 4, and Ryeley died two days later in a Pittsburgh hospital.

Beaver County District Attorney Anthony Berosh said Beatty was home alone with the girls and acknowledged he didn't check on them for 10 to 15 minutes after hearing the crash. The dresser weighed 124 pounds; the girls weighed about 30 pounds each.

Autopsies determined that the weight of the dresser prevented the girls from breathing.

'If the children's caregiver, namely David Beatty, the defendant, would have reacted immediately to the sound of the bang, both children would have survived this incident without significant injury,' a forensic pathologist told police, according to a criminal complaint.

Beatty and his wife, Jennifer, 28, face two counts each of endangering the welfare of children because of the 'deplorable' condition of their home, which included dirty bedclothes and diapers and human and animal waste on the floors, walls and beds, authorities said.

The couple's attorney, Dale Fouse, said the condition of the house had nothing to do with the children's deaths.

When asked to address the prosecutor's allegation that David Beatty didn't respond soon enough, Fouse said, 'The sound was described as a bang. As you may or may not know, children make sounds inside of a house.'

'We can't possibly foresee all of these circumstances,' Fouse said, adding,

'This looks to be just a tragic accident and it doesn't rise to the level of criminal culpability.'

Authorities say Beatty gave police various accounts of what happened, first telling them that he responded to the crash within 'seconds' and that he had left the girls alone to play in the room only while he drew them a bath.

Later, Beatty acknowledged he had been using the toilet and had waited 10 to 15 minutes to respond.

'He stated that he did not think much about the noise because the kids are always jumping off of beds and making noises,' police wrote in the complaint.

The Beattys were released on unsecured bond and will face a preliminary hearing July 31.

Beaver County Coroner Teri Tatolovich Rossi told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that 3-year-old Ryeley Beatty died on July 6 at Children's Hospital in Lawrenceville.

Deadly: Authorities were seen removing the dresser at the scene

Ryeley Beatty was taken there on July 4 after the dresser fell on her and her 2-year-old sister, Brooklyn, at their Aliquippa home in Western Pennsylvania.

'The girls appeared to have been playing in or around the bottom drawer of the dresser,' causing it to fall onto them, the paper reported.

Joseph Sheppard, who lives in the same neighborhood as the victims, told CBSPittsburgh their father 'said he was running bath water and he heard a boom. And he ran in there and I guess he lifted [the dresser up and brought the girls] outside.'

'I heard their father screaming, yelling,' the girls' next-door aunt Rebecca Beatty told WPXI. 'I rushed over and because I'm a nurse, and I started CPR on them right away [...] so it's terrible.'

Authorities were seen lifting the dresser out of the family's home.

Brooklyn was pronounced dead on July 6 at a Brighton hospital.

Brooklyn died of asphyxiation due to compression of her chest.

'Everybody
 who worked that scene... we were trying to console each other and the 
mom and dad,' Aliquippa Mayor Dwan Walker told the Tribune-Review. 'I 
talked to [the girls' grandfather]...to tell him the whole city was with
 him.'

A GoFundMe page has been set up to help cover the Beatty family's expenses.
