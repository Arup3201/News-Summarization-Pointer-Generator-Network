It has been the week from hell for David Moyes, the lowest point of a season in which his dream job became a nightmare.

But the support for him to turn things around for Manchester United should not be limited to those within Old Trafford. Every British coach and manager should be firmly behind Moyes, hoping he is successful.

Why? If Moyes fails, it will be a long time before a British coach is considered for one of the top jobs. Harsh though it may sound, it is the truth. Foreign owners won’t be prepared to take a plunge on those who have been ‘homegrown’.

Pear shaped: David Moyes has endured a torrid start to his Manchester United reign

Sequence: United's defeat at Sunderland in the Capital One Cup was their third on the bounce

Moyes is at the forefront of a crucial period for our coaches. It has not been a common theme in the modern era that, as now, the three biggest jobs in British football — United, Liverpool and England —have simultaneously been held by managers from these shores.

You have to go back to mid-1998, when Alex Ferguson was joined by Roy Evans and Glenn Hoddle, so it will be intriguing to watch how Moyes, Brendan Rodgers and Roy Hodgson go about achieving their aims.

Make no mistake, they are all under pressure to deliver. Rodgers has made excellent progress in his first 18 months at Anfield but where Liverpool go between now and the end of next year will determine whether he gets the chance to keep building.

Local: Brendan Rodgers has made big stride at Liverpool while Roy Hodgson led England to the World Cup

Looking abroad: Foreign owners such as Roman Abramovich have been reluctant to appoint British managers

Similarly, Hodgson needs England to give a bold account at the World Cup this summer. He has done a good job since replacing Fabio Capello but the demands and expectation are relentless. He will know what is required for him to stay in charge for Euro 2016 qualifying.

We need them to hit their targets to buck the trend of what has happened when British men have been elevated to the top. Mark Hughes had an opportunity at Manchester City but their owners didn’t believe him to be the man to secure Champions League football. They were criticised for appointing Roberto Mancini but he won the FA Cup and the Premier League in consecutive years.

Hughes is not a lone case. Sam Allardyce didn’t last long at Newcastle when his reputation was at its strongest; Hodgson got 191 days at Liverpool.

Brief: Sam Allardyce lasted less than a year at Newcastle after being appointed in 2007

Harsh: Mark Hughes was sacked by Manchester City even though they were in top four contention

Champions: Manchester City won the Premier League and FA Cup under Roberto Mancini

Critics have questioned why a British manager has never been given a platform at Chelsea but they have won 11 major trophies in the Roman Abramovich era, which shows it has worked for them. 

And look at the biggest job of all. The FA made a positive step for British coaches when appointing Steve McClaren in 2006 but within 18 months, he was sacked after failing to qualify for the European Championship. 

Sven Goran Eriksson and Capello took criticism but both qualified for every tournament they could and if Hodgson happens to have a bad time in Brazil this summer, the clamour will be for the FA to appoint another foreign coach.

I wouldn’t want that. The England team should be managed by one of our own but if they aren’t succeeding at club level, you can understand why the FA would be tempted to look abroad. It is alarming that only four of the 20 clubs in the Premier League are managed by Englishmen. In recent years, only Harry Redknapp has enjoyed success in a big role, reviving Tottenham — a club with a long history of looking abroad — and building their most stylish team in 30 years.  

You can see why clubs have a preference to look abroad, as many managers who come into our game boast impressive CVs. Whether it is Jose Mourinho or Carlo Ancelotti, Arsene Wenger, Gerard Houllier or Rafa Benitez, they all have a pedigree of success and that commands respect straight away.

There is also a mystique about working with foreign managers. I know from experience what it was like with Houllier and Benitez. There would be times in training when they would say something that I didn’t think sounded right but I would never fail to go along with them.

Houllier arrived at Anfield having helped orchestrate France’s victory in the 1998 World Cup; Benitez had won La Liga twice with Valencia and a UEFA Cup. Those achievements would run through your mind if you ever thought what you were being asked to do was wrong.

Is that something which is working against Moyes? For all his good work with Everton — stabilising a club that used to be threatened by relegation and turning them into regulars in the top six — he was appointed manager of the league champions after reaching one FA Cup final.

Disaster: England failed to qualify for Euro 2008 under Steve McClaren (left), but foreign managers like Sven Goran-Eriksson (right) and Fabio Capello always led the national team to major tournaments

Expressive: Rafa Benitez arrived at Liverpool having won two La Liga titles and the UEFA Cup with Valencia

Compare that with Ferguson. United were languishing towards the foot of the old First Division in 1986 but Ferguson came to Old Trafford having led Aberdeen to eight domestic honours, as well as the European Cup-Winners’ Cup and European Super Cup.

That is the problem now. In the past, British coaches had a packed CV because they filled all the top jobs, but the influx of foreign coaches has changed that. Wenger, Mourinho and Benitez have raised the bar and it is up to their British counterparts to meet the challenge.

I love having Mourinho and Wenger in the Premier League; I enjoyed it when Ancelotti was here and it would be great to one day see Pep Guardiola working his magic, but I am also passionate about  seeing British managers succeed.

We are quick to shout for their promotion but recent history shows it hasn’t worked. The onus, then, is on Moyes, Rodgers and Hodgson to lead the charge and show Britain has the talent for the top positions.

Even City should be glad Messi's back

I had a chance during a break over Christmas to read an excellent biography on Lionel Messi and, by coincidence, finished it the day he made a goalscoring return to action.

Football fans around the world would have been delighted to see him score two goals in Barcelona’s Copa del Rey victory over Getafe and the fact that he is back in action should be celebrated, particularly with the World Cup looming. He will be going to Brazil fresh and fit.

Even Manchester City players should be happy the Argentine is back.

Back with a bang: Lionel Messi returned to the Barcelona team and was straight in the goals against Getafe

Test: Messi will lead Barcelona into their massive Champions League tie against Manchester City

If I was in the position of Vincent Kompany or any other City defender, I’d relish the chance to test myself against Messi in the Champions League. Playing against the best players and competing in the finest arenas — how you do in those games can define your career.

While I was away, I bumped into Pep Guardiola. He said that with a fit Lionel Messi, Barcelona remain the team to beat in the Champions League. They have played together for so long and Messi gives them the  X-factor. Maybe Guardiola was trying to take some of the pressure off his own Bayern Munich team, as they attempt to become the first club to retain the Champions League, but it put into context what we have to look forward to when the competition resumes.

Bayern against Arsenal and City v Barcelona is what top-level football is all about. They are games to be savoured.

Theo Walcott has suffered terrible luck and will be heartbroken to miss another World Cup, this time through injury. But he is not the first Englishman to feel cursed when it comes to football’s biggest tournament, as this week’s list shows.

1. Kevin Keegan —  A two-time winner of the Ballon d’Or yet his World Cup experience lasted just 26 minutes in 1982. England failed to qualify when he was at his best and, to make matters worse, he missed a chance to score against Spain that could have put England into the semi-finals.

2. Jimmy Greaves —  No England striker has a better goals-to-games ratio than Greaves (below). But he scored only one in four matches in Chile in 1962 and injury cost him his place in the 1966 final. He didn’t get his winners’ medal until 2009 after the FA campaigned to FIFA for all Sir Alf Ramsey’s squad to be recognised.

3. Bryan Robson —  His first World Cup appearance couldn’t have started better. He scored twice against France in 1982 — one came after 27 seconds — but after that ‘Captain Marvel’ suffered immense frustration as injuries in Mexico (1986) and Italy (1990) cut his tournaments short.

4. Frank Lampard —  Few have given England better service in the modern era but luck has deserted him at the World Cup. He is yet to score in the finals, was ludicrously denied a goal against Germany in 2010 and, like me, missed a penalty in the quarter-final shootout against Portugal in 2006.

5. Robbie Fowler —  My old team-mate was at his peak in the build-up to France 1998 but he suffered a serious knee injury that ruled him out of the tournament. Flower (below) was selected to go to Japan four years later but his only involvement came as a substitute against Denmark.
