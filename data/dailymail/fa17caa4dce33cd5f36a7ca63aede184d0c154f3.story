Jack Wilshere has been caught smoking again - and fans fear this latest off-field discrepancy could be a sign of a player set to waste his great potential.

The Arsenal and England midfielder has already spoken about how his 'time is running out' to make a mark, and he could end up joining an unfortunate list of English players to throw away great talent away from the pitch

Here, Sportsmail looks at the top 10 English talents who never fulfilled their potential:

Jermaine Pennant

Pennant set a transfer record for a trainee when he joined Arsenal for £2million at the age of just 15 from Notts County. His skill and pace on the wing excited fans but poor discipline and time-keeping frustrated Arsene Wenger.

All that paled into insignificance though when he was jailed for drink-driving during a loan spell at Birmingham - and on release he was the first Premier League footballer to wear an electronic tag.

Pennant has since gone on to play for seven other clubs, and even played in a Champions League final with Liverpool, but without an England cap to his name it's indisputable that what was a great talent was wasted.

Young guns: Pennant played in the same Arsenal youth team as Steve Sidwell, Moritz Voltz and Jay Bothroyd

Jailed: A promising start at Arsenal turned sour for Pennant who was sent to prison for drink-driving aged 22

Keeping track: Pennant had to wear an electronic tag during the months after he was in prison

Michael Johnson

Back before the money came in, Johnson was the next big thing at Manchester City. A handful of impressive appearances made him a fans' hero before injury ruled him out of the side over the Christmas period in 2007. Former team-mate Dietmar Hamann likened him to Michael Ballack.

Even when Thaksin Shinawatra's millions made their impact, Johnson was still a key player and impressed alongside Elano under Sven Goran Eriksson before more injury troubles and three drink driving arrests.

Photos surfaced of him looking overweight and unfit in 2013 and Johnson later revealed he had been for treatment at The Priory Clinic for mental health problems - a sad end to the career of a player once tipped for the top with City and England.

Kieron Dyer

Dyer was blessed with the sort of pace and technical ability seen to be lacking in many English footballers - and he helped Newcastle qualify for the Champions League twice while being a regular in his country's midfield.

But he was also the poster boy of Newcastle's 'Brat Pack' of gifted players prone to scandal: he lived in a flashy penthouse, crashed a Ferrari into the Tyne Bridge after a night out and generally 'succumbed to temptation' as he later admitted.

He was judged to be the aggressor in a famous fight with team-mate Lee Bowyer on the pitch at St James' Park and after leaving Newcastle ended up as an expensive journeyman - spending the prime of his career as a £450,000-a-game flop at West Ham.

Lee Bowyer

A one-cap wonder with England, Bowyer was always at the heart of controversy during spells at Leeds, West Ham, Newcastle and Birmingham.

Being charged with grievous bodily harm with intent and affray, questions about his attitude towards racism and his on-the-pitch brawl with Dyer were among the low points - the first of which delayed his England debut while he stood trial.

But before all that he was a key player in the Leeds side that reached the Champions League semi finals and the goalscoring, all-action midfielder was even voted their player of the year in that 2000-01 season.

Lee Sharpe

Another player whose playboy image got the better of him, Sharpe was ditched by Sir Alex Ferguson despite being one of England's most exciting wingers.

His attitude to football was perhaps summed up in a conversation with Gary Neville about why the defender did not want to go on a night out. Sharpe asked Neville: 'You don't like nightclubs? In nightclubs there's beer, decent music, women, what exactly is there not to like?'

Sadly Sharpe is now probably better remembered for his appearance on Celebrity Love Island than his football, which says it all, really.

Stan Collymore

Tall, powerful, fast and skillful, Collymore was one of the stars of the new Premier League era when he scored 22 goals for newly-promoted Nottingham Forest.

But his outspoken nature - still obvious today in his media work - and supposedly poor work ethic made him unpopular with fellow players.

During his time with Aston Villa he assaulted then-girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson and ended up having short spells at a number of clubs incluidng Real Oviedo before retiring with a disappointing three England caps.

Couple: Collymore's relationship with Ulrika Jonsson and subsequent assault arrest was a huge low point

Outspoken: Collymore remains as controversial and opinion-dividing as a broadcaster as he was a player

Wayne Bridge

There was a time when Bridge was being talked about as a replacement for Ashley Cole in the England setup, such was his form for Chelsea.

But Jose Mourinho was unimpressed with his smoking habit and ended up bringing Cole to the club and shipping Bridge out to Manchester City - where he eventually ended up exiled from the squad.

Two Premier League winners' medals might be a decent boast for Bridge but he could have had much more.

Winner: Bridge scores for Chelsea against Arsenal at Highbury in the Champions League in 2004

Waiting in the wings: Bridge was constantly playing second fiddle to Ashley Cole, who he replaces here

Robin Friday

Any Englishman rated as 'the greatest footballer you never saw' has to make this list. Friday has been voted Reading's greatest ever player despite a career that lasted just five years, and was said to be good enough to play for England.

Former World Cup referee Clive Thomas claimed Friday had scored the best goal he had ever seen ahead of the likes of Pele and Johan Cruyff. He was constantly in scraps with other players and even kissed a policeman after scoring one goal.

But off the pitch his behaviour was even more erratic and his drug-taking, police arrests, up-and-down love life and tendency to dance naked in pubs made him tough to handle. In the end he quit at the age of 25 saying he was 'sick of people telling me what to do.'

Stan Bowles

Bowles was your typical 'character on and off the pitch' and wrote in his autobiography about spending his time drinking, gambling and womanizing during his playing days.

His tendency to 'take the p***', as he put it, made him unpopular with other players and he never really got a fair shot with England before walking out.

He also walked out on Brian Clough and a place in his European Cup-winning Nottingham Forest side, which probably represents one of the best examples of an opportunity lost.

Peter Knowles

Not the typical route for a footballer to throw away his career - Knowles quit the sport to become a practicing Jehovah's Witness.

Before that he had dreamed of an England cap and appeared for the Under 23s but never fulfilled his potential from his days with Wolves.

He remained on contract there for 12 years without playing a game and later ended up working in Marks & Spencer.
