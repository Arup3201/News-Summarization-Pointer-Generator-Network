Jailed: Rowan Diedrick, 29, was sentenced to 16 months in prison

A dog owner who watched his pet Rottweiler savagely maul a seven-year-old boy has been jailed for 16 months after being recognised by his mother in CCTV footage posted on YouTube.

Rowan Diedrick, 29, was walking his two pet Rottweilers off the lead along Southend seafront in Essex when one attacked a young boy as he was paddling in the sea and dragged him underwater.

Diedrick fled the scene immediately on August 5 last year prompting a six-month police campaign to track the mystery dog owner.

The young boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was rescued by his grandmother and needed 60 stitches after suffering several puncture wounds to his left arm and shoulder during the attack.

He has since endured three separate operations and will be offered plastic surgery when he reaches the age of 18 due to the extent of his injuries.

The unemployed builder, from Enfield, North London, was eventually arrested in February after his own mother shopped him to police after recognising him fleeing the scene in seafront CCTV footage posted on video site YouTube.

Diedrick appeared in the dock at Basildon Crown Court today wearing a black suit and tie with a suitcase packed in anticipation of an extended stay in jail.

He was sentenced to 16 months in prison having pleaded guilty in March to being in charge of a dog which was dangerously out of control in a public place and caused injury.

Judge Owen Davies QC said: 'The fact that the boy did not drown or was not mauled to a greater extent was down to the heroic and selfless actions of his grandmother.

'You allowed your dogs to roam without muzzles on a public beach. The behaviour you displayed after the event shows a callous disregard for the welfare of the victim.

Victim: The seven-year-old boy needed 60 stitches and three operations after being attacked by a Rottweiler

Judge Owen Davies QC, sitting at Basildon Crown Court Essex County, said Diedrick's only remorse was for his 'own fate'

'You left the scene and made yourself scarce. It was only thanks to the vigilance of others on YouTube that you were traced.

'You had every interest in escaping without being brought to account. Any remorse you have shown is merely for your own fate.'

But Judge Davies banned Diedrick from keeping a dog for the next 10 years and a destruction order was made for the four-year-old Rottweiler.

After sentencing the family of the boy said: 'We can never say enough how grateful we are that we still have our grandson and that he seems to be recovering well despite his injuries.

'We are pleased with today’s sentence and feel it was completely irresponsible of the defendant to take two large dogs onto a beach without being able to control them on leads.

'All dogs of that stature and aggressive nature should be on a short lead with a muzzle when out in a public place.

'If people want to own dogs like that they must understand the responsibility they have to others’ safety.'
