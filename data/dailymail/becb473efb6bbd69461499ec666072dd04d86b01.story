A Florida man convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend's baby by throwing the three-month-old out of a moving car while speeding down a highway has been sentenced to life in prison.

Richard McTear was found guilty last week of first-degree murder, kidnapping, battery and aggravated child abuse charges.

Following a jury's recommendation, a Hillsborough County judge sentenced the 26-year-old to life in prison yesterday. Prosecutors had been seeking the death penalty.

Authorities say McTear took the child after attacking ex-girlfriend Jasmine Bedwell in 2009.

They say he then threw the baby, Emanuel Wesley Murray, out of a car window on Interstate 275 in Tampa. The child was found dead along the side of the highway.

Prosecutors claimed during the trial the killing was 'the ultimate act of revenge' against Bedwell, who had sidled up to a new man in the days before the killing, according to reports.

The jury deliberated for about seven hours before handing down the guilty verdict in the murder charge and also on counts of kidnapping, battery and aggravated child abuse.

The guilty verdict came despite McTear's public defender arguing during the trial that there was no evidence definitively showing he had thrown the baby onto the road.

'There's no clear explanation of how that baby got to the side of that road,' Assistant Public Defender Mike Peacock said in his closing argument, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

He made this statement despite the child's blood having been found on both McTear and on a car seat.

Jurors cried when shown pictures of the dead child, the Times reported.

McTear's previous trial was declared a mistrial after Bedwell insisted the then-17-year-old man threatened to kill her son.

It was not the first time she made the accusation.

Bedwell's claim that her ex-boyfriend threatened to shoot her and her son and urinate on the child came up originally in a 2010 trial where McTear was found not guilty of battering her.

Prior to the commencement of that previous trial, the court ruled the phone call with the threat should not be introduced because it was part of a previous trial - where McTear was ultimately acquitted for assault - and was therefore irrelevant in the murder case.

But Bedwell gasped out the allegation amid tears as soon as she took the stand during the eventual mistrial.

Assistant State Attorney Ron Gale had asked Bedwell about phone calls from McTear the day before Emanuel's death.

Bedwell replied saying McTear had called her and 'told me that he was going to come over and shoot my baby in the face and p*** on him, in his face, and he was going to kill both of us.'

Gale acknowledged Bedwell's testimony was 'clearly... a violation' of the court order but he said he had not expected her to refer to the phone call, which took place about six weeks before her son's death.

However, he added that he had not specifically told her not to mention in their preparations for testimony.

'It did not come up,' Gale said.

McTear's lawyer argued that there was not enough evidence to show his client was responsible for the baby's death.

Prosecutors claim McTear entered Bedwell's apartment by force in May, 2009 and beat her before throwing the baby carrier against the wall while the child was inside it, ABC Action News reported.

He then allegedly drove off with the child and threw him out onto the motorway.

An off-duty TV cameraman spotted the child's body lying by the side of the motorway in Tampa.

Jason Bird said he thought it was a toy doll - until he saw the baby's eyes.

A huge manhunt was launched for McTear who had previous convictions for domestic violence and other violent crimes.

He was found hiding at a friend's house several hours after the incident and was arrested by police.

Bedwell, who was then 17, told police her ex-boyfriend grabbed her son and threw him down onto the pavement. He then picked him up in his carrier and raced off.

Police were about to issue an Amber Alert until the baby's body was found by the side of I-275, the main motorway leading into Tampa on Florida's Gulf Coast.

TV cameraman Bird, who was on his way to work for a local station, said: 'Just out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw some trash on the side of the road. But the more I thought about it, I saw eyes.

'It flipped me out, and I started shaking and said, "It's a doll, a baby doll".'

Police in Florida said at the time that Bedwell had previously sought a court injunction to keep McTear away from her family.

The matter was dropped, though, after she failed to turn up for a court hearing.
