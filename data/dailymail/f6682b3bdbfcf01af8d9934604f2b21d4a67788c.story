Police are investigating claims that deer are being illegally poached and decapitated in order to trade their heads for drugs.

Farmers in the Gippsland area of south-eastern Victoria, have reportedly discovered piles of headless deer on their properties after smelling their decayed cadavers.

Police authorities confirmed that the presence of the dead deer on farmland was linked to crime activity by an organised gang who exploited the  animals as a way to fund methamphetamine addiction.

'These groups have been conveying the heads to Melbourne with an aim to either swap them for drugs or exchange for money to buy drugs,' said Benalla Detective Sergeant and Agricultural Liaison Officer Shannon Murphy.

It is believed that the deer heads are being traded for drugs or sold for cash to buy drugs, with the heads fetching up to $300, Detective Sergeant Murphy told The Age. 

'I wouldn't say it surprises me, we've got some good local hunters who have utilised their skills to support their criminal activities in the only way they can,' he said.

Detective Sergeant Murphy said that the organised gang had been using lookouts, along with  encrypted two-way radios in order to capture and slaughter the animals.

Authorities said that the gang had also been using spotlights on the deer, a species known as Samba, which freeze in the light. 

Police in Mansfield, Benalla and Wangaratta confirmed that at least six people have been charged with illegal hunting offences related to the decapitating of the animals.

In the past 18 months the incidents have increased, with Game Management Authority officers reporting that up to ten reports had been recorded in the space of one night. 

Col Brumbley, Victorian State President for the Australian Deer Association, said that he had never heard of something like this before.

'The ADA completely condemns this kind of behaviour. It's this element of people who taint it for the rest of us,' said Mr Brumbley. 

'The whole thing is deplorable. The minority of people who want to behave badly should have the full force of the law come down on them,' he said.

'Everyone from the organisation would have an issue with this. Farmers might have a poacher come in and accidentally shoot stock at night instead of deer, which gives us a bad reputation.' 

A farmer from Alexandra, in the Goulburn River region of Victoria, said that he had heard shotguns in the night and had found the headless cadavers of deer both on his property and near the road, reported The Age. 

'To me, they (these illegal hunters) are no better than dogs that see a rabbit and kill it just to kill something,' he said.

The farmer said that there was an added danger of using high-powered rifles on farm land, as the guns could shoot houses from a thousand metres away.  

'There is a bit of an ego thing for some people with killing deer with large antlers,' said Mr Brumbley.

Between 2013 and 2014 approximately 50,000 deer were killed by hunters with licences, with a majority being the Sambar deer, a breed known for their large antlers. 

Police are continuing to operate patrols in the area and were fitting cameras to further their investigation, reported The Age. 

The ADA boasts nearly 6,000 members and takes an ethical stance on the organisations approach to deer hunting.

'We are good people. Hunting is a massive industry and I don't think we get the attention we deserve, and it's a shame that something like this draws attention to the minority,' said Mr Brumbley. 

'We're not a bunch of yahoos running around with guns, doing the wrong thing,' said Mr Brumbley.

'This kind of behaviour makes us look like a bunch of rednecks, but most of us are educated beyond secondary school. What we do is a legitimate sport and we are just trying to do the right thing,' he said. 

It is believed that the heads are being sold without taxidermy, with Mr Brumbley estimating that taxidermy for deer heads would cost up to $600.
