David Cameron has been labeled stupid by Argentina's ambassador to Britain in an astonishing attack over the Falklands.

Alicia Castro rounded on the Prime Minister during a speech to the Argentine senate, calling him stupid and dumb .

She accused him of being 'inefficient' for criticising Pope Francis' stance on the disputed Falkland Islands.

Her amazing outburst is set to inflame the already strained relationship between Britain and Argentina and lead to reprisals from Downing Street.

The former air hostess, an admirer of Hugo Chavez, ambushed William Hague over the Falklands in May last year by asking him at a public meeting whether he was ready to 'give peace a chance' by opening talks on the islands' future.

Her stinging attack on Cameron came at a meeting of the Argentine senate's Foreign Affairs commission.

Using the Spanish word Malvinas for the Falklands, she said: 'Cameron was so stupid and inefficient when Pope Francis was chosen as the new papal leader because he broadcast what he had been saying about the Malvinas.'

Asking if it was appropriate to describe someone as "stupid" in Parliament, she went on to dub Cameron 'foolish'.

She added: 'We had the extraordinary luck to be blessed with an Argentine pope who is a Falklander.'

Cameron criticised the new Pope's stance on the Falkland islands in March by saying he 'disrespectfully' disagreed with comments he made last year when he was cardinal in Buenos Aires that Britain had 'usurped' the islands from Argentina

Appearing to ignore the fact Argentina tried to take the Falklands by force in 1982 by invading the disputed territory and sparking a war with Britain, she added. 'Argentina does not represent a military threat to the United Kingdom or the inhabitants of the islands.

'What does constitute a military threat is the enormous military might of the United Kingdom in the south Atlantic.'

The PM also joked about the signal from Rome's Sistine Chapel signalling a new Pope after an overwhelming vote in a March referendum by islanders to remain British, saying: 'The white smoke over the Falklands was pretty clear.'

Alicia Castro said at the time: 'It is striking that the prime minister should dare to rebuff the Pope.'

The diplomat also made headlines by refusing an invite to attend Margaret Thatcher's funeral.

In 2010, when she was Argentine ambassador in Venezuela, an ex-worker accused of her of bullying her and stealing cash.

Castro rejected the claims in a letter published in Argentine daily Clarin.

After the death in March of Hugo Chavez, who once claimed Halloween was terrorism implanted by the US in Venezuela, she said: 'He made us all see a better world is possible.'
