A high school golfer remained in critical condition today following a bus crash that killed three people, including a teammate and their coach.

Members of the Grayling High School golf team were traveling to a tournament Monday when their northbound van struck an eastbound van on a rural road in Kalkaska County, about 25 miles east of Traverse City.

Louis Menard, 18, golf coach Jason Potter, 28, and a passenger in the other van, Cassandra Stapleton, 27, all died according to Michigan State Police.

Tyler Summers was in critical condition at Munson Medical Center in Traverse City.

Two other teammates, Jacob Hinkle and Dallas Johnson, were in serious condition at the hospital. Mason Krey and Gunner Metzer were in fair condition.

Sgt. Don Bailey said investigators will try to determine the speed of the vehicles and whether Potter stopped at a stop sign at the intersection of Crawford Lake Road and County Road 612.

Both vans rolled after the crash.

Distraught: Relatives of the victim Jason Potter comfort each other following his death

'It looked like they came together simultaneously. ... There's a reason why things happen. We're trying to figure out what it is,' mR Bailey said.

He said Menard apparently wasn't wearing a seat belt and was ejected from the golf team's van

The driver of the other van, Rhonda Mitchell, 45, was in fair condition at Munson Medical Center.

Her 3-year-old granddaughter also was in fair condition.

Alcohol is not considered to be a factor in the crash, Mr Bailey said.
