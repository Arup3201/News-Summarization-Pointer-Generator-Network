Football supporters faced travel disruption on Sunday as overhead wire problems on one of the country's busiest lines brought train services to a halt.

The problem between Rugby and Milton Keynes affected services between Manchester Piccadilly and London Euston, bringing disruption to both Stoke City and Southampton supporters. 

After witnessing their side suffer a 3-0 defeat by Arsenal at the Emirates, there was further woe for Stoke supporters who discovered that their trip back home involved a lengthy diversion via Leeds.

Mark Hughes' side had planned to return north via train but were forced to travel home by coach due to the problems.

Fans of Southampton who travelled to Old Trafford by train to watch the match against Manchester United already faced a long journey home but now face uncertainty as to when they will arrive back on the south coast with disruption expected to continue until 8pm on Sunday night.

Some trains are now running through the affected area at reduced speeds, although a number of services have been cancelled entirely.
