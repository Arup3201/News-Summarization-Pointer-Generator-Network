A baby boy found dead in his young mother's shopping bag after security guards allegedly spotted her shoplifting at a New York Victoria's Secret was murdered, officials have finally ruled.

The death of Tiona Rodriguez's infant son death was ruled a homicide by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner Tuesday - months after his October, 2013 passing.

The child, who hasn't been identified, died as a result of homicidal asphyxia, a spokeswoman said, adding that he was alive for less than a day.

The Manhattan district attorney's office declined to comment to the New York Daily News on whether Rodriguez will now face murder charges. The teen, who has a 2-year-old son, told the Daily News Tuesday that she had 'no idea' about the homicide ruling.

Homicide: The death of Tiona Rodriguez's infant son death was ruled a homicide by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner Tuesday - months after his October, 2013 passing. She is shown in October at a court hearing for shoplifting charges

'No idea': The teen, pictured in October, told the Daily News Tuesday that she had 'no idea' about the homicide ruling. It's not clear if she will now face murder charges

Homicide prosecutors had been probing the case since the teen was arrested. She wasn't initially charged over the macabre find.

The
 then-17-year-old, was released without bail after she pleaded not 
guilty to petty larceny and possession of stolen property charges.

However
 at the time, authorities said they couldn't bring charges over the dead
 baby until forensic tests determined exactly how the full-term newborn 
died.

Preliminary
 reports from detectives suggested the fetus was born alive and may have been asphyxiated.

'I
 don’t want to ignore the elephant in the room, but we are only 
arraigning the shoplifts,' Assistant District Attorney Robert 
Hettleman told the court at the October hearing, according to New York Daily News.

The court released Rodriguez' friend 
Francis Estevez without bail and soon after more than a dozen uniformed 
police officers and 
detectives had descended on her Queens home with a crime scene unit 
truck, a neighbor said.

Police
 believe Rodriguez gave birth in Estevez's home shortly before the shoplifting arrest. The 
investigators spent two hours going through an upstairs apartment where 
Estevez's family lives.

The friends were arrested on October 17 in a 
Victoria's Secret shop on 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan.

The grisly discovery was made when the two girls were stopped by a 
security guard as they left the store in Herald Square on suspicion of 
shoplifting.

But as well as
 allegedly finding stolen goods inside the 
bags, the guard noticed there was a strong odor inside and found a tiny 
body under the loot.

Rodriguez
 told detectives she had delivered a day earlier and didn't know what to
 do, authorities said.

'Shoplifting with a 
baby in her bag the entire time certainly suggests a little bit of 
difficulty following society's rules,' Hettleman said at the hearing, adding that the matter was still under investigation.

'The
 NYPD, my office and the office of the Chief Medical Examiner are going 
to continue to vigorously and thoroughly investigate the matter relating
 to the baby,' he told the Post at the time.

An initial autopsy of the dead baby was 
inconclusive, and more tests were needed to determine how the child died, according to the city medical examiner's office.

But New York Police Department spokesman, 
John McCarthy, said that the case was still being investigated and that 
police were awaiting the medical examiners' determination of the cause 
of death.

After Rodriguez was arrested on Thursday she was taken to Bellevue Hospital and both girls were arrested on petit larceny charges.

On her Facebook page late on 
Wednesday night, Rodriguez had complained about period cramps, and 
added that she was excited about an upcoming job interview at Chipotle.

One of Rodriguez's neighbors said she was shocked to hear the teenager had been pregnant.

Zami
 Ford, 17, said: 'I've known her since she was little. She was probably 
nervous and didn't know what to do. She would never hurt anyone.'

She said she was unaware of the teen's pregnancy and was stunned by the allegations.

'She's a good girl. I can't believe she would do that.'

Another
 neighbor, Lydia Perez, said: 'She had to have hidden that pregnancy for
 a while. I saw her outside here the other day with her family, and her 
baby.

'There was a whole bunch of joy. You would never know there were 
any problems.'

Customers at 
Victoria's Secret were also shocked to hear that a dead infant was found in 
the store, but most sympathized with the schoolgirl. 

'She must be going through a big depression. She must have been wondering how she was going to get rid of it,' Yvonne Sonera told the Daily News.
