Arrest: Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, allegedly had sex with three high school students

A third former student has stepped forward 
to claim he had a sexual relationship with a teacher who has been 
arrested for having a baby with one of her 16-year-old students.

The latest victim was just 14 when he allegedly had sex with Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, then 23, in her classroom before school, as well as her apartment and in her car in 2007.

The teacher, now 28, was arrested on Monday in Redlands, California after she gave birth to a baby allegedly fathered by a student, who is now 17, last month.

She met the student while acting as his adviser at Citrus Valley High School and they allegedly had a year-long relationship. She was released on Monday night after posting bail. 

After reports of her arrest surfaced, another student stepped forward to claim he had sex with Whitehurst in 2007 when he was a 16-year-old student in her English class at Redlands High School.

The victim, who identified himself to NBC4 as 22-year-old Michael Cooper, said the class had been told to write about their dreams and afterwards, Whitehurst told him she had dreamed of kissing him during a school field trip.

'I didn't have anything to say 
really,' he said. 'I was like, "Oh really, that's crazy," and a couple 
of days later, we ended up actually kissing.'

He
 said that they kissed in her classroom and two weeks later, she invited him to her apartment and 
he spent the night.

They 
continued to have sex a few times a month but he said he never felt as 
if they were in a relationship, but when they contacted each other, they
 both knew what was going to happen, he said.

'When
 it happens, you're kind of like, 
all right, this is pretty badass,' he said. 'You know, my teacher is 
into me. I was 17 and I was having a good time is what it was.

'I didn't feel like a victim; I'm not 
scarred for life or anything. To be honest, I had a 
good time when it was going on.'

But
 in spring 2008, he said he stopped returning the teacher's messages and
 calls as he had a girlfriend and had started to feel guilty. They 
eventually broke the relationship off amicably, he said.

He added that he did not get preferential treatment in class because of their relationship.

Cooper
 has filed a police report but told authorities he does not wish to 
press charges. He told NBC4 that he wanted to share his story to 
encourage other victims to come forward.

Whitehurst said that they had a 
relationship 'but not to that extent', Redlands police Detective Natasha
 Crawford said during a phone interview.

Police
 said a case would be submitted to the County District Attorney's office
 next week and additional charges will be determined.

Whitehurst was taken into custody in 
connection with the most recent student just before 9pm on Monday after being 
questioned at her Redlands home.

The 28-year-old, who teaches 10th-grade 
English at Citrus Valley High School, faces a charge of unlawful sexual 
intercourse with a minor. She was released from jail after posting 
$25,000.

According to the Redlands Police 
Department, Whitehurst's underage lover - with whom she had a child - was 16 years old during their 
year-long relationship, which allegedly started last summer.

The
 mother of the alleged victim, who is now 17, became 
aware of the affair between her son and his teacher and notified the 
Redlands United School District, which in turn contacted police. 

Whitehurst gave birth to a child June 18, and police say her former student is the father.

Since her arrest Monday evening, Whitehurst had been placed on administrative leave.

‘Nothing is as important to us as the safety of our students and the District takes this arrest very seriously. We are fully cooperating with police in their investigation of this matter,’ Assistant School Superintendent Sabine Robertson-Phillips said.

The educator graduated from Redlands East Valley High School and taught English to sophomores at Citrus Valley, where she was also a Link Crew adviser and a Compact Careers Club adviser.

In 2010, Whitehurst was also an assistant soccer coach. She previously was a volunteer soccer coach for American Youth Soccer Organization in Redlands.

The news blog PE.com reported that Whitehurst's father, Dale Whitehurst, has served as principal of Brywn Mawr Elementary and Moore Middle schools in Redlands.

He also worked as assistant principal at Redlands Easy Valley high School.
