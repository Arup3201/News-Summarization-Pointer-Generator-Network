A New England fisherman netted a four-clawed lobster of the coast of Massachusetts last weekend.

The unusual crustacean was snagged May 17 by a commercial fishing boat out of Gloucester, about one hour north east of Boston.

Captain Joe and Son’s Lobster Company owner Joey Ciaramitaro posted pictures of the beast to the Good Morning Gloucester blog Friday afternoon.

Very unusual: This four-clawed lobster was caught last weekend by a commercial fisherman out of Gloucester, Massachusetts

Pictures show the sea beast with an unusual four pincers, but it is otherwise normal.

Gloucester is one of New England’s busiest fishing ports, and Captain Joe and Sons has been in business for 61 years, according to NECN.

That smarts!: This lobster would pinch first and ask questions later

The four-clawed creature has nothing on a few other bizarre catches.

Just last year, Gloucester fisherman Lou Williams, skipper of The Pretty Girl, netted a 20-pound lobster with claws bigger than a human face.

He told WBZ that he released it back into the wild after posing for a few pictures.

A 21-pound lobster was captured off the shores of summer vacation hot spot Cape Cod the prior year, the station noted.

The prize for biggest lobster, though, goes to a 37.4-pound beast also caught off the coast of Cape Cod, according to the Massachusetts Lobstermans Association.

In October 2012, a half black, half orange lobster was caught the week before Halloween by a fisherman from nearby Salem. It too was donated to an aquarium, according to the station.

The award for most claws goes to a six-clawed lobster snared off the coast of Maine, a state famous for the prized crustacean. 

It was donated to an aquarium, according to WBZ.

There’s no word on what the ultimate fate was of Gloucester’s four-clawed lobster.

It is highly unusual, but a lobster caught in 2012 had six claws
