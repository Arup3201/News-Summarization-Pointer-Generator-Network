The lights may have only just gone down on Jahmene Douglas’ X Factor experience, but the singing sensation has already signed up to his first commercial deal to start his music career – and with none other than his former employer, Asda.

Just 12-hours after the X Factor results were announced to the world Jahmene was straight into a studio to record the iconic festive song ‘Silent Night’.

The 80-second ad is a way for Jahmene to thank Asda colleagues and customers who supported and voted for the 22-year-old throughout the show.

Busy boy: Jahmene has been working non-stop since leaving X Factor and has been in the studio for Asda

'I feel so blessed by the whole X Factor experience and it so exciting that I am recording for Asda. Over the last two weeks I have been sleeping and grieving the loss of my X Factor family,' he told MailOnline.

Loveable Jahmene, whose iconic smile and giggle captured the nation's hearts and carried him through to the final, grew incredibly close to his fellow finalists.

'I love my X Factor family. Union J and James Arthurs are like my brothers and I love Jade Ellis too.'

Jahmene's life has changed drastically since he left his job at Asda to pursue his singing career.

'In May I was working out how to make my way up the ladder in Asda but I took a risk and it paid off and I am just taking it all step by step.'

Brothers: Despite losing out to James Arthur for the crown, the two boys remain great friends

Life changing: A few months ago Jahmene was figuring out how to work his way up in Asda and now he is destined for stardom

He added: 'The support I had from Asda colleagues and shoppers nationwide during the X Factor was overwhelming, and I don’t think they realise just how much this meant to me.

'Recording Silent Night for an online version of Asda’s Christmas advert is my way of saying thank-you to everyone who voted for me, so I hope people like it.'

His biggest fan is pop star and mentor Nicole Scherzinger, who he became extremely close to during his time on the show.

'I love Nicole. We still text and email most days, she is in Indonesia or Dubai at the moment. Her "Jahmazing" phrase is funny, but she does have lots of those weird sayings doesn't she?' said the Swindon-born star.

Describing the highlight of his X Factor experience, he said: 'I always get cheesy here but the best part was honestly the people I met.

'Although I love Rylan, I'm not quite ready to meet his friend Katie Price just yet!'

Close: Him and mentor Nicole Scherzinger still text regularly

He added: 'I've always moved around a lot and never settled but in X Factor I really did settle. I am currently looking for a flat in London but it is impossible to find a place.'

Jahmene's life has been non-stop since he left the show, as well as working as an ambassador for Women's Rights he is joining Doreen Lawrence on a trip to Parliament.

'I want to use my position wisely,' he said.

And it seems that his position in the musical world is firmly established- Simon Cowell is said to be so 
impressed with Jahmene's falsetto vocals and hard work on the show, he 
is planning to give him a recording contract regardless of the fact that he closely missed out on the top spot.

Louis
Walsh revealed last week that he has been talking to the music mogul 
and he said he has 'big plans' for both winner James Arthur and Jahmene.

Reunited: He can't wait to be reunited with his X Factor family on the UK tour in January

The pair will be reunited for the long-awaited X Factor tour in January, which Jahmene cannot wait for.

'Reuniting with everyone for the tour will be emotional. It will be nice to have no judging panel,' he said.

But for now, the singer is happily touring around the UK and trying to spend time with his family in between.

'I want to spend Christmas in good company with lots of food. I didn't eat on the X Factor so I am going to pig out,' he said.

He added: 'It was an amazing feeling to record my first song in the studio that wasn’t for the show. I feel blessed to have had this opportunity and can’t wait to see what the future holds.'
