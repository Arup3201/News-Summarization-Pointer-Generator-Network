A top lawyer who hid his depression hanged himself on holiday after his bouts of drunken rage forced his wife to flee back to Britain with their two young children.

Lahra Tyndall, a BBC Breakfast producer, had persuaded her husband Adrian to see a local doctor while they were away. But he began ranting in the taxi on the way to his appointment and stormed out of the car.

After his wife left for the UK, she expected Mr Tyndall to follow her on a later flight. But instead she received a text message from him saying: ‘I came back to the villa and you were all gone.

‘I can’t for the life of me remember what happened once we got in the car, just it was cruel. Try to forgive me. I’m not bad, just weak.’

Portuguese police were alerted but his body was found in their villa by its manager.

Mr Tyndall, a specialist in employment law who ran his own practice, having previously worked with top law firm Eversheds, struggled with depression for years, an inquest was told. 

But he had tried to keep up appearances at home and work because he was ashamed about having the illness.

Mrs Tyndall told the hearing: ‘Adrian viewed himself as weak but he wasn’t at all – he tried extremely hard to overcome his problems.

The inquest was told that Mr Tyndall's outbursts eventually forced his wife (pictured after the hearing) to fly home to the UK, believing he would follow her

‘We went to see the mental health nurse, and he was terrified of being sectioned. The nurses put him under the care of the crisis team. I raised with them his sense of shame that was holding him back from recovering. I also talked about his ability to cover things up, pretending he was OK when he wasn’t.’

To block out negative thoughts, Mr Tyndall began drinking heavily, putting a strain on his marriage.

Two years ago his wife told him they would have to separate if he didn’t sort out his problems. They had marriage counselling but she later found his wedding ring and a suicide note on a shelf in the house.

Then in April last year he was discovered on the bathroom floor of the family home in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, with a knife and a bottle of gin.

Mr Tyndall agreed to have five sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to address his depression. But his wife told the inquest: ‘He felt embarrassed and scared of his problems and had little or no faith in the CBT.’

The family’s three-week break to the rural area of Ourique in central Portugal was in August last year.

But despite pleas from his wife and mental health team not to drink on holiday, Mr Tyndall hit the bottle soon after arriving. He also confessed: ‘I can’t go on like this. I’m too weak. I need to end it all.’ His wife then booked a taxi to take him to see a doctor.

She eventually flew home when he became particularly aggressive. ‘Adrian had never behaved like that before,’ she recalled. ‘It was like dealing with a stranger.’

Coroner John Pollard recorded a verdict of suicide.
