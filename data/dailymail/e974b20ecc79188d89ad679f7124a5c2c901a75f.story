The driver of the bin lorry that killed six people in Glasgow had years of professional experience behind the wheel, it was revealed today.

Harry Clarke, 58, from the Baillieston area of the city, joined the local authority four years ago and was initially employed to provide transport for children with learning difficulties.

He is believed to have remained in that role for a year, which also included driving gritters, before moving to the cleansing department. Before joining the council he had worked for First Bus.

Meanwhile it was also revealed that Mr Clarke had passed the rigorous medical exam needed to keep his driving licence in 2012. He is still receiving counselling after collapsing at the wheel.

Mr Clarke required a Heavy Goods Vehicle driver’s licence for his jobs at both First Bus and the council - which involved regular tough medical examinations, reported the Sunday Mail.

His neighbours have described him as a ‘generous’ man who was always willing to help. One woman, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I’m genuinely shocked to learn he was involved.

‘My experience is of a decent man, well mannered, who was always prepared to help keep the communal areas clean. I know his neighbours will be wishing him a quick recovery.’

No details of any health issues or the explanation for what may have caused Mr Clarke to fall ill have so far emerged. He was treated at the Western Infirmary after the incident on December 22.

Despite him having been released two weeks later, another neighbour said there had been no sign of Mr Clarke since the incident.

He said: ‘I’ve not seen him. I am shocked to hear he was involved. He’s a good and decent guy, always pleasant and helpful. I hope he gets the support he needs.’

Investigators for Police Scotland are expected to submit their final report on the tragedy to the Crown Office in the coming weeks.

A probe of eyewitness accounts and technical data has been pieced together. The families of those killed in the crash have been constantly updated on how the investigation has been progressing.

Eyewitnesses said Mr Clarke appeared to fall ill at the wheel of the vehicle before losing control and hitting Christmas shoppers on Queen Street.

The truck eventually came to a halt when it crashed into the Millennium Hotel. Last week relatives of three victims from the same family paid tribute to the ‘truly overwhelming’ support they received.

John 'Jack' Sweeney, 68, his wife Lorraine, 69, and their 18-year-old granddaughter Erin McQuade were all shopping when struck by the truck.

Primary school teacher Stephenie Tait, 29, tax worker Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh were also killed in the crash.

The Crown Office is expected to respond to the police probe by the end of next month. A decision on whether to hold a fatal accident inquiry will be taken by Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland.
