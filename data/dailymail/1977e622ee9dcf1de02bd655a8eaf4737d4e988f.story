Ms Wolfe, who is also a NBC News national correspondent, has remained active throughout her entire pregnancy.

Last week she and NBC News journalist Jeff Rossen posed for a picture to celebrate the end of their fitness challenge, in which she helped her colleague get over his hatred of working out. 

The pregnant journalist and fitness expert even appeared on a recent episode of The Biggest Loser, where she visited the contestants as a guest trainer and led a group workout.

'If you've been working out all your life, you'd be doing a disservice to your body to stop all activity during a pregnancy,' she told Today.

She noted: 'When asked how I stay sane and focused both at home and at work, I usually point to the gym. It has always been my stress reliever.'

Last, month Ms Wolfe shared photos of Ms Gosk and their adorable daughter as they prepared for another baby, including a sweet snapshot of Harper helping her mom put together a new double stroller.

After giving birth to Harper in 2013, Ms Wolfe likened her baby's arrival to a 'religious experience'.  

'You carry this little person around with you that you have yet to meet for nine months, and then all of a sudden the stars just align and it's you and this little angel and this person that you love,' she said. 

She added: 'You go from being two people finding their way to a family instantaneously, and it's one of the most wonderful feelings in the world.'
