Real Madrid and Spain star Sergio Ramos has had a tattoo of the late pop singer Michael Jackson drawn on the top of his forearm.  

Jackson, who died in 2009, is featured in the 'Black or White ' outfit he wore while filming the music video for the hugely successful 1988 single. The tastefully done design is the latest of many ink jobs for Ramos, who has garnered a reputation for his often extravagant body art. 

In June last year, the defender celebrated his successes with both club and country by having tattoos of the Champions League and World Cup trophies etched on the back of his calves.

Ramos has played a combined 28 games for Real Madrid and Spain so far this season, scoring six goals.  

Madrid are currently top of La Liga with 45 points and have a game in hand over second-placed Barcelona who have 44. 

Los Blancos won their last game 3-0 over Getafe with Ramos playing the full 90 minutes.
