With her killer cheekbones, party girl demeanor and elusive personality, Kate Moss has become a British icon.

But what's her secret to supermodel success? Her close friend and business partner Sir Philip Green seems to think he has the answer.

'The bottom line is this: she manages herself well,' the entrepreneur told the Evening Standard.

'She's been smart, she understands the fashion business, she doesn't go talking everywhere. And she hasn't run off and put her name on everything.'

Power of knowledge: Sir Philip Green has revealed Kate Moss's secret to success, saying she doesn't 'put her name everywhere'

Perhaps Sir Philip, who has once again got Kate on board to collaborate with his beloved Topshop, hasn't taken note of Kate's recent projects.

She may have just hit the big 4-0 but 
Mossy clearly isn't letting her age get in the way of her career if 
her recent work is anything to go by.

The
blonde was recently unveiled as the face of Alexander 
McQueen's SS14 campaign, Rimmel's SS14 campaign, as well as the pre-SS14 campaign for Liu J.

At the end of last year, she was announced as the face of St. Tropez and even designed a range of smartphone accessories for Carphone Warehouse.

Bigger than ever: At the age of 40, Kate is still going strong and one of her most popular campaigns was with St. Tropez last year

A lucrative four year partnership with
 Sir Philip Green at Topshop, reported to have earned her more than 
£3million, ended in 2010 but she is back on board to design a new collection to be sold in 40 
countries this year.

And her hard work is certainly paying off. After twenty stellar years dominating the industry, Kate saw her earnings triple in 2012 alone.

Her
 total earnings as of October 2012 for the preceding year totalled 
£11.72 million - that's nearly three times the amount she earned in 
2011.

Maria Malone, Senior Lecturer and fashion expert at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: 'When Kate Moss first appeared in magazines, she was a quirky antidote to the long legged doe eyed, perfect in every way type models that consumers were previously bombarded with.

'Kate is unique and distinct in appearance preventing look- a- likes and making her stand out from the usual cloned models. 

'She has a natural "imperfect" yet unmistakable beauty which makes women relate to her and men believe her to be a more approachable 'girl next door' than the unobtainable supermodels of old.

'The shelf life of a model is short but Kate Moss is more than a model: she is a brand, a British brand.

'All good brands provide a security in the purchase; you have bought the right thing. Age and time only adds strength to the brand. This will ensure that while other models retire when the inevitable wrinkles start to appear; the brand KM continues to grow.

'Some would argue that Kate has put 
her name to too many products. One glossy magazine recently had four 
adverts featuring Kate Moss in the first 25 per cent of the publication'

'Some would argue that Kate has put her name to too many products. One glossy magazine recently had four adverts featuring Kate Moss in the first 25 per cent of the publication.

'However, she is incredibly strategic in her choice of brands. They range from low-cost cosmetics (affordable to young girls) to mid-price tanning products (attractive to all ages), then high-price luxury brands (affordable to only a few - but aspiration to many), the one thing they have in common is that they are all credible brands.

'This ensures that the brand Moss 
continues to be reliable to customers and reaches a broad spectrum of 
the market resulting in her longevity as a fashion icon.'

Sir
 Philip Green's comments came as he helped the secretary of state for 
education Michael Gove unveil a scheme whereby 15 state schools will 
enjoy special treatment from his company Arcadia.

'He's the only person I know who has both Tony Blair and Kate Moss on speed dial,' Gove told the Evening Standard of Green.
