Henry was meant to be a miniature pony - but he was getting bigger and bigger by the minute.

The owners of the two-foot tall pony just couldn't figure out why he had become so bad-tempered, until they noticed his stomach was all bloated.

It wasn't the result of eating too much hay, however, that was causing the problem, but Henry's strange habit of swallowing sand.

Snacking on sand: Henry the 2ft high Shetland pony became ill after grazing on sand in an all-weather paddock

He had been left to exercise in an outdoor all-weather paddock and, it seemed, had taken to the taste of its grainy covering.

Unfortunately, his new meal had blocked his large intestine and this was having an effect on his other organs.

His owners and other horse-lovers rallied round to quickly raise £6,000 for life-saving treatment and Henry is now making a full recovery.

Owner Caroline Howarth, from Coppull near Chorley, Lancashire, bought Henry when he was six months old for her eight-year-old daughter Madison.

'As soon as I saw him I knew we had to have him,' Mrs Howarth said.

'But after a while we noticed his tummy was getting bigger and bigger. Day-in, day-out it just kept swelling.

'I thought he might need worming and I kept a firm control on his food intake.

'It did not stop and the vets took a blood sample which said his liver wasn't working properly.

'They gave him more tests and my horse insurance level of £1,000 ran out.

'We had to fund any future treatment ourselves.'

Happy again: The miniature pony is now making a full recovery after the emergency treatment, which was paid for by local horse lovers

Fellow horse lovers at the Seven Stars Stables at Standish, where Henry lives, decided to raise money for treatment by going on a sponsored walk.

Henry was taken to the Equine Hospital at the Leahurst Campus of the University of Liverpool, which specialises in rare illnesses and serious injuries to horses.

Vets there decided to flush Henry's stomach and found a build up of sand was causing all the problems.

They carried out surgery to save his life and placed him on a special diet as he recovers back to health.

Mrs Howarth added: 'He is a cheeky little horse and at the horse hospital they had to put a notice on his stable saying he was an escape artist.

'He now has a special diet - but no sand!'
