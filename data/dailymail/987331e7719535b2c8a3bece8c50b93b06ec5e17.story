From a referee’s point of view Luis Suarez is a problem.

If he feels he does not have a chance of scoring he will go to ground and demand a decision from you – at Anfield that applies massive pressure.

We saw during Sunday’s game examples of 
this when Martin Demichelis appeared to make no contact with him just 
outside the area and when Vincent Kompany laid a very light hand on him 
inside the area he went to ground on both occasions.

Problem: Graham Poll believes Liverpool striker Luis Suarez (right) is a difficult player to referee

Sneering and snarling: Indignant Luis Suarez is a nightmare to referee

Handle with caution: Suarez was booked by referee Mark Clattenburg against Manchester City on Sunday

Soft touch: Suarez (left) felt he should have been awarded two penalties at Anfield on Sunday

He screamed at the injustice when Mark Clattenburg rightly refused to give either decision his way.

If Suarez played for the team I supported then I’d love him.

He is a great finisher with pace and a single-minded mentality to score goals. He also has a great work-ethic and is a team player. He provides as many goals as he scores himself.

However, all of this comes at a price and, as a result, when he plays against you then you really don’t like him.

What really annoys fans is the way he is indignant and insists he has never done anything wrong.

When a referee does wave away those appeals he sneers and snarls at them in an aggressive manner.

The
 conundrum for football writers, of course, will be that he is 
impossible to ignore as a contender for Player of the Season and yet 
seemingly impossible to vote for at the same time.

From
 my perspective as an ex referee, while I would have found him a 
complete pain for the 90 minutes I was refereeing him, I would have to 
admit that as a supporter I would want him to play for my team.
