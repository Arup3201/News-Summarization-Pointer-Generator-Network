Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has heaped praise on former team-mate Daniel Sturridge - labelling the Liverpool forward as 'one of the best strikers in the world'.

Kompany will come face-to-face with Sturridge once more on Monday night as City host Liverpool in the Premier League at the Etihad Stadium.

And the Belgian expects a tough test from Brendan Rodgers' men, who he does not believe have been greatly weakened by the departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona.

Kompany told skysports.com: 'Suarez is a world-class striker and he is almost irreplaceable. However, Liverpool have strengthened in other areas and they still have one of the best strikers in the Premier League and in the world in Daniel Sturridge, who is still improving every season.

'We certainly will not be viewing them as any less of a threat from last season. If anything, we will be expecting an even tougher game and we have to make sure we are at our very best to get all three points.'

Sturridge has netted an impressive 36 goals in a half-century of matches for Liverpool since moving to Anfield in January 2013 and could soon be partnered up front by former Blue Mario Balotelli.

The Italian is expected to complete a £16million move from AC Milan before Monday's match. 

But it is Sturridge - who scored six goals in 32 appearances for City between 2006 and 2009 before moving to Chelsea, Bolton Wanderers on loan, and then eventually to Anfield - who Kompany will be determined to keep a keen eye on at the Etihad.

The City captain continued: 'He (Sturridge) was a City player, obviously, so I played with him while he was at the club and against him at Chelsea, Bolton and now Liverpool. All the way through he has always shown great talent and great ability.

'Outside the games against us, he is someone I have always wished the best for because he is a great person and a great player. He is hard to play against but, at the same time, I enjoy playing against the top strikers in the world and I consider him in that bracket.'
