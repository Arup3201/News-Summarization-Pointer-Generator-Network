A family-of-three on a fishing trip were fortunate to escape with their lives after their car broke through the frozen surface of a lake and sank in just five minutes.

The father, mother and child were on an ice fishing trip on the lake in Qitamu township near Changchun, the capital of north-eastern China's Jilin province.

They were not the only people who had driven onto the ice and in the background of the footage of the incident, other cars can be seen driving around on the frozen surface during an annual ice fishing festival.

The car started sinking because its owners parked it near a hole they had carved out for ice fishing

After a few minutes, nothing of the car was left on the ice. Authorities said the vehicle's engine heated the ice beneath it, causing cracks

Their problems began when they dug a hole in the ice and parked their Audi Q7 near it, extending a fishing rod into the lake while keeping warm in the car.

Local police believe that the heat from the car's engine slowly melted the ice which, cracked as a result, creating a hole in which the vehicle began to sink.

Witness Zhen Ku, 34, who filmed the incident, said: 'It was lucky the family managed to escape at the last moment before the car sank completely. No one was injured but it was still a sad sight to see.'

Crowds attending the fishing festival gathered around to watch the vehicle quickly disappear below the ice, shedding the family's belongings into the water as the rear door sprung open just before it sank to the floor of the lake.

As it disappears into the hole, fishing gear can still be seen poking out of the window, and other cars can be seen driving on the ice behind.

According to police, no one was injured and the car was later recovered.
