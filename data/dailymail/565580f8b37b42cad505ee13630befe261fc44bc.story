A report revealed Sunday suggests that tech giant Apple could be planning to take the plunge into the automobile and medical device markets.

The San Francisco Chronicle reports a meeting of the minds between spy-turned-Apple acquisitions executive and Tesla Motors entrepreneur Elon Musk took place this spring.

And it's more than just electric cars in which we could be seeing the famous Apple logo. The company is rumored to be researching a device that can predict heart attacks.

Electric iCars? Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former spy turned Apple's acquisitions officer Adrian Perica in the spring. Now rumors are swirling that Apple has designs on a plunge into the automobile industry

Secrecy: The meeting with Musk (pictured) suggests a major meeting of the minds and wallets of Silicon Valley, but neither his company nor Apple have publicly commented

'Adrian Perica is a very busy man,' 
begins Sunday's report in the San Francisco Chronicle, which suggests 
the company's deals man, who was once an intelligence officer, is eager 
to blaze new trails for the company.

According to the Chronicle, Perica met with Musk and likely Tim Cook sometime last spring.

'While
 a megadeal has yet to emerge,' reads the reports, 'such a high-level 
meeting between the two Silicon Valley giants involving their top 
dealmakers suggests Apple was very much interested in buying the 
electric car pioneer.'

This 
is not the first hint of a possible iCar. Just last June, Apple 
announced plans to put its operating system into vehicles and a leak of 
what it might look like followed.

In addition to cars, Apple is also reportedly dabbling in medical devices.

With
 the help of audio engineer Tomlinson Holman, who developed LucasFilm's 
famous THX technology, Apple is creating ways to determine when a person
 may soon suffer a heart attack by listening to the way their blood is 
flowing through their arteries.

And last month, Apple met with the FDA potentially to discuss a 'Healthbook' application for iOS.

'Apple
 must increasingly rely on new products to reignite growth,' Bill 
Kreher, an analyst with Edward Jones Investments in St. Louis, told the 
Chronicle. 'They need the next big thing.'
