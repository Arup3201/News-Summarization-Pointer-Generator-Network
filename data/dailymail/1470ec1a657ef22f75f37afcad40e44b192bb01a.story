A man has pleaded guilty to assaulting three people in a massage parlour on Christmas Day, after becoming unhappy with the service offered.

Nathan Paul Bantick, 22, argued about money with staff at the parlour in Swansea before attacking two female employees and another customer who came to their aid.

Bantick pleaded guilty to two offences of assault against the women and one of actual bodily harm against the man, and was told by Neath Magistrates’ Court that his crimes were so serious he would have to be sentenced by a judge at Swansea Crown Court.

Argument: Bantick visited the parlour on Swansea High Street with his brother, who was wearing a Santa hat, in the early hours of Christmas morning

Assault: Bantick began shouting at one of the women before attacking her, then went towards the second woman, threw her phone against a wall and hit her

Aggressive: Bantick subsequently launched a vicious attack on a man who came to the women's aid, punching and kicking him up to 24 times and leaving him with loose front teeth and permanent nerve damage

Bantick visited the parlour on Swansea High Street with his brother, who was wearing a Santa hat, in the early hours of Christmas morning, the court heard.

CCTV footage shows him emerging from a bedroom with two women at around 3am, one of whom was wearing pajamas and another also wearing a Santa hat.

Shortly after he is seen arguing with the workers, apparently voicing his displeasure at their service and how much it was going to cost.

Bantick began shouting at one of the women before attacking her, then went towards the second woman, threw her phone against a wall and hit her.

When she later tried to leave the room, Bantick’s brother stopped her from leaving.

Bantick and his brother then fled the scene, with police later issuing a public appeal for information

At this point a male customer intervened to stop him.

Bantick subsequently launched a vicious attack on the man, punching and kicking him up to 24 times and leaving him with loose front teeth and permanent nerve damage.

He and his brother then fled the scene, with police subsequently issuing a public appeal for information.

Bantick pleaded guilty to two offences of assault against the two women, one of actual bodily harm against the man and causing £875 of damage.
