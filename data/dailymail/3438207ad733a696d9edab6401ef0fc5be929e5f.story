Criticised: Unite's leader Len McCluskey is under fire over his ex-mistress' new job

Labour was accused of another ‘conflict of interest’ with union baron Len McCluskey yesterday after it emerged his former mistress has been given a top job at his union.

The Unite general secretary’s ex-lover Jennie Formby, who gave birth to his child while he was still married, was last month given a £75,000-a-year post as the powerful union’s political director.

She is also a member of Labour’s National Executive Committee, which is made up of senior Labour Party MPs – including leader Ed  Miliband – and sets the direction of party policies.

The appointment raises more questions about the unions’ influence over Mr Miliband, after Unite was accused of rigging a parliamentary selection contest in Falkirk to try to get Karie Murphy, a close friend of Mr McCluskey, chosen as the candidate by signing up new union members without their knowledge.

Mrs Formby’s new role will fan the flames as she will be helping as many union supporters as possible get picked as Labour candidates for the 2015 general election.

It is understood she has already challenged Mr Miliband over his response to Falkirk, telling him he should not have brought in the police.

Mr Miliband handed over the file to officers earlier this month in a major escalation of the row with the union, which has donated £11.9million to the party since 2010 and whose votes helped him win the leadership over his brother David.

It was revealed that Mrs Formby –under her maiden name Sandle – gave birth to a child in 1991, whose father is named on the birth certificate as Mr McCluskey.

They were then both working at the Transport and General Workers Union, which later merged into Unite, and Mr McCluskey was living in union-subsidised housing in London while his wife Ann stayed in his native Liverpool.

When Mr McCluskey divorced Ann three years later, he set up home with another woman, and his former mistress married Frederick Formby in 2004.

Tory MP Stewart Jackson said yesterday 
that ‘serious questions must now be asked about whether Mr McCluskey had
a conflict of interest’ in appointing Mrs Formby.

Controversial appointment: Jennie Formby, was last month promoted to serve as Unite's political director, and is also a member of Labour¿s National Executive Committee

In a letter to Mr Miliband, he wrote: ‘You have spoken out strongly against Unite’s actions in Falkirk.

'I am sure you will agree with me that this appointment now begs new questions as to whether Unite’s leadership is not only rigging Labour selections, but also appointments to its senior team.

‘I call on you on to join me  in condemning this appointment, and that you investigate the process under which it  was made.’

A senior Unite official said most members were not aware of the connection between Mr McCluskey and Mrs Formby and that her appointment would also fuel criticism that the union is ‘run by a clique’.

Another official said while she is considered to be able, she has benefited from her connection to Mr McCluskey, adding: ‘She has always enjoyed strong support from Len, and he is so dominant in Unite you can’t get far without it.’

Last night a Unite spokesman said: ‘All appointments are authorised and ratified by the union’s executive council.’ He declined to comment further.
