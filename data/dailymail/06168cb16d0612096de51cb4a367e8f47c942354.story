David Cameron today took aim at triumphant UKIP leader Nigel Farage, dismissing his image as a ‘normal bloke down the pub’.

The Prime Minister hit the airwaves after the Tories were pushed into third behind UKIP and Labour, despite his repeated promise to hold an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.

Mr Cameron said the message from voters had been ‘absolutely received and understood’, but challenged the idea that Mr Farage is anything other than a ‘consummate politician’.

Prime Minister David Cameron said the Tories understand the message from voters, after being pushed into third behind UKIP and Labour

After 10 of Great Britain's 11 regional constituencies had declared their results, Ukip had 23 MEPs and a 29.07 per cent share of the vote - up 11.68 per cent on 2009.

Labour had 18 MEPs and a 25.35% vote share, narrowly ahead of the Tories with 18 MEPs but 24.56 per cent.

Mr Farage, a privately-educated ex-City trader, has played up the idea that he is different to the other party leaders, with regular visits to pubs, including to celebrate last week’s local elections.

But he has faced criticism over his use of Brussels allowances and employing his German wife Kirsten using taxpayers’ money.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Listening to him on the radio and television over the last few days it all seems supremely tactical.

‘It’s all about trying to grow votes in clusters or something in different parts of the country. So I don’t really accept this thing. He is a consummate politician.

‘We have seen that with his expenses and wife on the pay roll and everything else. So I don’t really accept that he’s a normal bloke down the pub thing.’

Eurosceptic Conservative MPs said the results from across Europe proved their point.

Harwich and Essex MP Bernard Jenkin wrote on Twitter: 'Some of us who opposed Maastricht 20 years ago predicted it would lead to the rise of the right in the EU: and here we are.'

Douglas Carswell, the Clacton MP, said: 'So maybe those of us who sometimes banged on about Europe were on to something?'

There were fresh calls from some Tories for an electoral pact with UKIP, to stop the haemorrhaging of support in key seats.

But Mr Cameron said there would be no deal, but a renewed focus on what the Conservatives could promise voters.

Ministers are drawing up plans for a new crackdown on migrants’ access to benefits to try to win back disaffected voters from Ukip.

The new push, which could see unemployed EU nationals kicked out of the country after just six months, was announced yesterday amid continued fallout from the Ukip surge in last week’s elections.

Currently, new arrivals cannot claim benefits for the first three months in the country followed by six months in which they can. 

Yesterday Home Secretary Theresa May confirmed plans to cut the period in which migrants can claim benefits to just three months.

And Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told The Sunday Times it would be ‘bye bye’ for anyone who had not found work after half a year in the UK.

However, the policy faces opposition from the Liberal Democrats, who are yet to sign off on the idea.

Critics claimed the policy would have little impact on David Cameron’s drive to reduce net migration below 100,000 before the next election, as it would have no effect on the tens of thousands of arrivals each year who do go on to find work.

And questions were raised about the likelihood of large numbers of unemployed EU nationals being removed from the UK when ministers struggle to throw out foreign criminals.

He has pledged that if he is still Prime Minister after the next election he will claw powers back from Brussels before holding an in-out vote by 2017.

‘People are deeply disillusioned with the European Union, they don’t feel that the current arrangements are working well enough for Britain and they want change,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘I would say that message as far as I’m concerned is absolutely received and understood.

‘What we need to do is demonstrate that we are the ones with the plan to sort out this relationship and give people the choice – in or out – by the end of 2017 in that referendum and that is now the task ahead of us. I think that’s what we have got to focus on.’

Former Tory leadership challenger David Davis has called for the EU referendum to be held sooner, to convince voters that the party will deliver on its promise.

But Mr Cameron said: ‘I don’t agree with that because I want to complete a proper renegotiation, which will improve Britain’s place in Europe and will improve Europe as a whole.

‘I think what’s interesting from last night’s elections and from what European politicians are saying is that there are some like Nicolas Sarkozy, former president of France, who is now saying it really is time for the European Union to give back powers to member states.

‘So where I was something of a lone voice in arguing for this a year ago you can now see a number of allies.’

Tory MEP Dan Hannan argued that if the UKIP and Conservative vote was combined, it would form a majority ofthe electorate and could deliver victory at a general election.

He told Sky News: 'If you add the Conservative and Ukip votes together in this country - and I know it doesn't work as simply as that - a rough ballpark figure, we are something like 56% of the total vote.

'It would be very sad if the two right-of-centre Eurosceptic parties at the general election were not able to find some way, at least in marginal seats, of reaching an accommodation so that anti-referendum candidates don't get in with a minority of votes.

'How it would work, if it were to happen, is obviously to be determined at a more senior level than mine. But if personal rivalries and animosities put Ed Miliband in with a minority of the vote, that would reflect badly on all concerned.'

But Mr Cameron was adamant that he would not do a deal with UKIP. 'We don't do pacts and deals. Conservative candidates will stand as Conservatives, fight as Conservatives and I hope win as Conservatives,' he said.

'We are not going to be doing deals and pacts.'

But the premier ducked the question of what disciplinary action would be taken against Tory candidates who struck local arrangements with Ukip, saying only: 'I don't see any prospect of this happening.

'From what I read in the Sunday newspapers, Nigel Farage wants to destroy the Conservative Party, not work in tandem with it.

'I think there's a great myth that there's somehow some great pact or deal to be done.

'If you want a referendum on Europe, if that's the most important thing for you, there is only one party and one potential prime minister that can deliver that and that is the Conservatives in government. Labour and Liberal Democrats don't want that referendum, Ukip can't deliver it.'
