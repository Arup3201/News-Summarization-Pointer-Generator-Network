The murdered bride of Shrien Dewani sent a text message saying her new husband was a flop in bed on their honeymoon, it was claimed today.

Mr Dewani, 34, from Bristol, was last
 week extradited to South Africa to face trial for the murder of his 
wife Anni Dewani, 28, who died when she was   shot in the neck as the 
couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town while on their 
honeymoon in November 2010.

Taxi driver Zola Tongo, who testified that Dewani set up the killing, was jailed along with the two gunmen.

Revelation: Dewani is pictured with his wife, Anni. South African police say he ordered the killing as he was gay and wanted out of the marriage

Shrien Dewani arrives at the airport in Cape Town after his extradition from Britain last week. He has been sent to a psychiatric hospital until next month after a brief court South African appearance in which he was formally charged with murdering his wife

South African authorities believe millionaire Mr   Dewani is secretly gay and wanted to get out of the marriage.

The Sun reported Mrs Dewani's uncle Ashok Hindocha claimed she texted cousin Sneha Hindocha saying: 'Finally did it. Not as good as my previous boyfriends.'

He rubbished reports that Mrs Dewani said: 'Last night we had it five times'.

Mrs Dewani's phone was taken by killer Xolile Mngeni during the carjacking, during which Dewani said he was thrown out of the taxi.

The   police have only just seen the text after hacking into the Blackberry - a notoriously hard model to crack.

Previously, a 40-year-old male prostitute based in Birmingham told police he met Dewani for sex sessions after the relationship with Anni had begun.

The 34-year-old was brought to Western Cape High Court in Cape Town in a police convoy after he was extradited from Britain last week at the end of a long legal battle

Munich-born Leopold Leisser, known as the 'German Master', told police that Dewani – whom he photographed during one of their meetings – told him that he   was engaged.

'He said that she was a nice, lovely girl, and that he liked her, but that he could not break out of it in any way because he would be disowned by the   family,' he said.

But a source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Police have always said the motive for Dewani was he wanted to get out of the marriage without admitting he is gay.

'The fact Anni told her cousin they were having sex regularly severely damages that argument.'

Dewani fought a long legal battle against extradition to South Africa to face a conspiracy to murder charge.

He lost and now his lawyers, citing his mental health, have appealed to the Supreme Court.

Dewani, a care home owner, has always denied ordering the killing of Anni.  He has always denied being gay and says he can prove he was elsewhere on the dates Leisser said they met.

Anni's father Vinod Hindocha, 64, and Sneha have previously spoken of their misgivings about the relationship even before the couple had their lavish   £200,000 wedding in a Mumbai hotel.

Anni's father told police that she wanted to end the engagement and walked out on her husband-to-be.  Mr Hindocha said that Anni became convinced that Dewani would change and told her father: 'Papa, he's like a Hitler - but don't worry - I will get   married.'

Over a period of four months before the murder, 28-year-old Anni sent a sequence of messages to her cousin Sneha in Britain and they show the young bride   had deep-seated reservations about Dewani.

In one despairing message five weeks before the wedding, Anni tells Sneha: 'I don't want to marry him... I'm going to be unhappy for the rest of my   life... one cannot even hug him... we have nothing  in common.'

Claims: Prosecutors claim Dewani hired a hitman to kill his wife, which Dewani has consistently denied

In another text, Anni wrote: 'Want to cry myself to death.'  Yet another read: 'Crying every day.' A month before the wedding she texted: 'Hate him.'

And three days before her death, she messaged Sneha: 'I don't feel happy at all.'  Sneha has told police that Anni called off the engagement and marriage at least three times, only for Shrien to change her mind each time.

When the texts are taken alongside statements from other witnesses, the police files depict a marriage that was doomed before it began.

Xolile Mngeni, who prosecutors claim was the hitman, was convicted of premeditated murder over the shooting, and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe,   pleaded guilty to murder and was handed a 25-year prison sentence.
