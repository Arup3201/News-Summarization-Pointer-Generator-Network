They're not usually the food or drinks you would consider exceptionally unhealthy. 

But smoothies, milk and  bacon have been revealed as foods for containing sky high levels of sugar, salt and fat.

And even Britain's favourite Terry's Chocolate Orange contains more than 150 per cent of an adult's recommended amount of saturated fat. 

Pizza Express' American pizza's salt content is 110 per cent of the recommended daily amount

A two-liter bottle of Pepsi (left) contains 220g of sugar and the Innocent smoothie has 35g. 

Alongside the surprisingly unhealthy foods are more obvious items such as gammon steaks, pork pies and pizzas. 

Ten of the worst examples have been exposed by expert food and drink taster Martin Isark, founder of the consumer website Can I Eat It.  

Just one of these favourite treats would take you over the safe daily allowance for fat, salt and sugar.

Mr Isark found that a single unsmoked gammon steak from Sainsbury's contains 6.8g of salt, equivalent to 114 per cent of an adult's recommended daily limit.

A Ginsters Extra Large Cornish Pasty has 20.4g of saturated fat, which is 102 per cent of an adult's recommended daily intake.

And a Pizza Express American pizza, sold in a variety of supermarkets, has 6.5g of salt, equal to 110 per cent of the recommended daily amount.

Four rashers of Wall's unsmoked bacon contained 6.8g of salt, 112 per cent of the daily limit for the average adult.

And pork pie lovers could be in for a shock too.

A Pork Farms Original Pork Pie, weighing 300g and available from discounter Lidl has a whopping 30.4g of saturated fat - 152 per cent of an adult's recommended daily intake.

Danger foods: Pork Farms pork pies contain 30.4g of saturated fat whilst Waitrose's A Seriously Pistachio Hazlenut and Almond Milk Chocolate Egg has 20g of saturated fat and 27.6g of sugar 

Terry's Chocolate Orange contains more than 150% of an adult's recommended amount of saturated fat

Dessert loves face a double whammy of unhealthy ingredients as sugar and fat content rockets in some supermarket favourites.

A Seriously Pistachio Hazlenut and Almond Milk Chocolate Egg from Waitrose contains 20g of saturated fat, equal to 100 per cent of an adult's daily limit, plus 27.6g of sugar, equal to a third of the daily recommended amount of sugar. 

Terry's Chocolate Orange contains an astonishing 30.5g of saturated fat, more than 150 per cent of an adult's recommended amount, as well as 102g of sugar, equal to 113 per cent of an adult's suggested health limit.

Some drinks are in danger of pushing consumers over the health limit too.

An Innocent Smoothie Pomegranate Blueberry and Acai drink contains 35g of sugar, equilvalent to 3.5 Krispy Kreme Original Glazed Donuts. 

It has almost 30 per cent more sugar per 100ml than Coca-Cola, and is the most sugar-rich smoothie on the market.

And a carton of Mars Flavoured Milk has 128g of sugar, which is 142 per cent of an adult's recommended daily intake.

Mr Isark said: 'Your long-term health starts with the types of food and drink you put in your shopping trolley. 

'A portion of food that contains more than your daily allowance, of salt, saturated fat and sugar are potential killers - leave them on the shelf.

Ginsters Extra Large Cornish Pasty has 20.4g of saturated fat - 102% of an adult's recommended daily intake

There is 6.8g of salt in just four rashers of Wall's unsmoked bacon; 112% of the recommended daily limit

'Food producers and supermarkets are in business, to make a profit. And there is nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately, this sometimes gets in the way of providing the very best nutritional information for their customers' health.

'For example, their serving suggestions on the front of their products and on the product's nutritional back label are often not the norm for their shoppers: half a pizza, quarter of pork pie, half tin of baked beans, four squares of chocolate... It would certainly be helpful and healthier for their customers if they also provided nutritional information for the whole product not an unrealistic portion size.

'The encouragement of over-buying and over-eating has gone on for far too long, no wonder obesity, diabetes and heart disease are all on the increase.
