When you’ve been walking around the world for nearly 16 years, you would think your toughest obstacles would be extreme temperatures or complete mental and physical exhaustion.

But Karl Bushby’s biggest adversary hasn’t been the elements or his own body – it’s been Russian border officials.

The former British paratrooper was denied entry into Russia in 2012 despite previous visits, forcing him to take a detour on an epic quest that may end with a major gap unless he is allowed to return to the transcontinental nation.

Roadblock: The former British paratrooper was denied entry into Russia in 2012 despite previous visits

Mr Bushby, from Hull, started his 36,000-mile journey in Punta Arenas, Chile in November 1998 and he hit a major roadblock when he was turned away from Russia after covering more than 20,000 miles.

The 45-year-old doesn’t know the reason he was not allowed to enter the country, but he suspects it may have something to do with an accidental crossing into Siberia.

He said: ‘I think there were security concerns from the outset regarding my military background but I left the army before the walk began.

‘I also suspect it might have been issued due to my accidental crossing a provincial border in Siberia without the necessary paperwork - but given the landscape there it is difficult to tell whether this actually happened.’

The 45-year-old from Hull is currently walking across the US from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C.

Karl Bushby plans to apply for a visa when he visits the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C. this month

Mr Bushby’s extraordinary journey is nearing a critical point as he walks across the US, from Los Angeles to Washington, DC, and sleeps in a tent along the way.

When he completes the 2,600-mile trek around 10 September – one year and seven days after he departed Los Angeles – he plans to visit the Russian Embassy to convince officials to grant him a new visa.

If he is granted entry his hike will not end in Russia, however. He plans to travel across Europe – averaging 20 miles a day – and hopes to complete his journey in the UK within six years.

But if the visa ban is not lifted he will have to wait another 10 years before he can legally apply to return to Russia.

He said: ‘ I can only hope the embassy takes note of my goodwill gesture - walking 3,500 miles across the US with a letter to the ambassador - and allows me a few moments to plead my case.

‘The best part about this trip has been everything - from falling in love, finding cold water, not being shot at by guerrilla armies, arriving at a long sought after waypoint, making your 20 miles a day, to even a cup of coffee.

‘The worst parts have been your heart broken, being alone, mosquitoes, getting stuff stolen, never being able to reach that waypoint, unable to make the 20 miles a day, and, of course, getting banned from entering a country.’
