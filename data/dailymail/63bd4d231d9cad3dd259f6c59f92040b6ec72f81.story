A rugby player believed to have Britain's biggest feet is unable to play for his club side because he cannot find a pair of boots that fit him. 

Carl Griffiths, 22, has worn out his last pair of boots playing for Trimsaran rugby club, near Llanelli, south Wales, and cannot find a suitable new pair for his size 21 feet. 

He has been taking to the field in size 18 boots for the past three years with his toes curled up in the ends. 

But after keeping them together with black sticky tape, they have finally fallen apart.

The 22-year-old has to import specially made trainers from the US which costs £100 because of his huge feet

Carl Griffiths had been squeezing his feet in to size 18 Mizuno boots - but they have finally fallen apart 

Standing at six foot eight, his club miss him on the pitch, especially in the line-outs. But all of the contacted sports clubs say they simply do not make boots as big as a size 21.

One specialist large-size shoe website stocks Canterbury and Gilbert rugby boots up to size 15 — still three sizes smaller than the ill-fitting boots he had already been wearing, and six sizes smaller than his actual shoe size.

His club are now appealing for help to find a new pair of boots that fit. 

Mr Griffiths, who lives in Carmarthenshire, West Wales, said: 'I'm hoping someone can help out because of how frustrating it is.

'Not being able to play because of not having shoes is just aggravating.

'At least when you have an injury, you know you just can't play for a while. But when I'm out just because of not having shoes that fit, it's just really frustrating. I just want to play rugby.

'I've had some boots in size 18, I wore them with my toes curled right up, but I broke a toe when someone stepped on it.

'The boots I have had haven't really fit properly for a long time.

'I've played a few games with broken boots taped up over the holes, and I've been doing some of the training sessions wearing my normal trainers, but I end up spending more time on the floor than I do in the game.

Trimsaran Rugby club have been taking to Twitter to appeal for help to find a pair of boots for their player

An appeal has been launched by his club - Trimsaran rugby near Llanelli - to find him a new pair of boots

It is believed his enormous feet are the result of drugs he was given to combat childhood leukaemia

Rugby boots are only available on websites up to size 15 - which is six sizes smaller than Mr Griffiths' feet

'All the boot companies we've asked say they just don't make them that big.

'I did get a quote from one company to specially make me a pair, but it would cost well over £300. 

'I have had times when I've had to take time out from rugby before and tried other sports, but it's rugby that I really want to play.'  

It is believed Mr Griffiths' enormous feet are the result of drugs he was given to combat childhood leukaemia.

He was eight years old when doctors discovered he was suffering from the disease, and after a course of chemotherapy he was treated with steroids to help him regain his strength. 

His feet sprouted within a year of stopping steroid treatment at 13 after he was given the all-clear, which is unusual because steroids usually restrict growth.
