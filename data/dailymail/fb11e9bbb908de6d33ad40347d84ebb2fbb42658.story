Iain Duncan Smith has claimed his flagship Universal Credit scheme has been vindicated after evidence showed it is was helping people find work quicker and earn more.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said research suggested that those receiving Universal Credit are 5 per cent more likely to find employment within four months than those on Jobseekers Allowance.

They spent an average of four days more in work during that period, earning around £50 more, according to the analysis.

But Labour said Universal Credit - which starts being rolled out across the country tomorrow - was massively behind schedule and saving far less than expected.

The system replaces a bundle of  benefits - including job seekers' allowance, tax credits and housing benefit - and is designed to prevent situations where people can be worse off taking jobs than staying on welfare.

From tomorrow, the government begins a staggered roll-out of the benefit, for claims by single people, at a further 150 job centres. Once this is complete, it will be available in one in three jobcentres in Britain, ministers say.

About 50,000 people in selected areas have claimed the benefit since it was introduced in April 2013 - far fewer than the government originally said would be getting it by now.

Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'The only person who believes Iain Duncan Smith's promises on Universal Credit is Iain Duncan Smith'

Computer problems have also caused delays and forced ministers to write off tens of millions of pounds.

Mr Duncan Smith insisted it had been better to delay the scheme rather than risk problems.

'I would rather have this work, I would rather have it that everyone's experience as we have seen already is positive, people are going into work quicker, they are staying in work longer, and they are earning more,' he said.

He also said the programme was under its budget, dismissing a multi-million pound write-off of failed IT.

'All IT systems in development, the private sector and the public sector, of course you invest in them, some bits and pieces don't work, there's always a certain amount of a write down and some write off,' Mr Duncan Smith said.

'Compared to the expenditure of something in the order of £2.4 billion that was originally expected we are now spending £1.8billion, and included in all of that we are actually spending £600 million on this development less than was originally expected.'

But shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'The only person who believes Iain Duncan Smith's promises on Universal Credit is Iain Duncan Smith.

'Iain Duncan Smith promised Universal Credit would save taxpayers £1.7 billion in reduced error and fraud. But now he's admitted the Government has cut the amount of planned savings by two thirds.

'Iain Duncan Smith promised one million people would be claiming Universal Credit by April 2014. But the latest figures show only 26,940 people on the new benefit. At this rate it will take 1,571 years to roll out Universal Credit.

'Labour wants Universal Credit to work and we'll call in the National Audit Office to do an immediate review of this failing programme to get a grip of the spiralling waste and delays.'
