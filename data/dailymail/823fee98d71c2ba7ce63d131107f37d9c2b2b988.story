Children could be protected from scenes of sex and violence on TV by new laws following a warning from a senior Government adviser that the traditional 9pm watershed no longer works.

Ministers are considering the case for legislation unless broadcasters develop their own safeguards to stop youngsters accessing inappropriate content using new ‘catch-up’ services.

Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers’ Union charity, who advises Downing Street on the sexualisation and commercialisation of childhood, called for the introduction of a cinema-style ratings system for all broadcast content.

He insisted the rise in ‘time-shifted’ viewing of TV -- on the internet or other catch-up services -- meant the old 9pm watershed could not survive in its current form.

‘If you go to the age-rated system — 12, 12A, PG — it is simpler and has a high trust level,’ Mr Bailey said.

Under the existing rules, broadcasters are not allowed to air material unsuitable for children before 9pm or after 5.30am. The rules exclude what is defined by Ofcom, the broadcastiing regulator, as inappropriate ‘sexual content, violence, graphic or distressing imagery and swearing’.

Polls suggest the watershed still enjoys strong public backing, and parents believe 9pm is the right time for it to apply. Since 2003 broadcasters have been sanctioned more than 300 times for breaching the rules, including the screening of singer Rihanna’s sexualised music video in the afternoon.

However, campaigners warn the onset of technology which increasingly allows people to choose when and how they watch material is undermining the old system.

Content is being accessed through hard drives, online replay sites and box sets.

Though some websites ask for an assurance people accessing or ourchasing material are over 18, critics say in many cases it is easy for teenagers and younger children to tick a box and proceed.

Figures show ten per cent of all television viewing is now “time-shifted” rather than live, up fivefold over five years.

For children under 16, 13 per cent of their television viewing is on catch-up services and the trend is expected to accelerate as new ‘smart TVs’ and games consoles, using high speed broadband to deliver broadcast content, become more popular.

Vivienne Pattison, director of campaign group Mediawatch-UK, said: ‘I am the parent of a seven-year-old who has no concept of linear television. He has no idea of not watching when he wants to watch.

‘If you have a young teenage audience at 6.30pm and then you put out a version with extra spicy bits later at night — well, who do you think that is aimed at?’ 

She suggested curious youngsters were using catch-up services to watch shows as Channel 4’s The Joy of Teen Sex and My Daughter the Teenage Nudist, as well as the post-watershed spin-off of the soap opera Hollyoaks.

Channel 4 insisted it protected children viewing inappropriate material on its catch-up service using Pin codes and parental locks.

Tony Close, director of content standards at Ofcom, said: ‘The TV watershed is an important way to protect children. We recognise the growth of on-demand TV viewing poses new challenges.

'We are working with government to ensure that children remain protected.’ 

A spokesman for the Culture, Media and Sport department said: ‘More needs to be done to ensure safety measures and tools that prevent children watching post-watershed programmes, such as [parental] locks and Pin protection, are more widely used.

'We will keep progress under close review and if necessary consider the case for legislation to ensure that audiences are protected to the level they choose.’
