A couple on benefits lived a lavish lifestyle by scamming more than £100,000 from the public by posing as children’s charity collectors.

Glen and Lynne Moore bought a villa with a swimming pool, personalised number plates for their cars and regularly took expensive holidays overseas.

When they were not on holiday, the shameless married couple preyed on the public’s goodwill by staging collections for children’s charities.

The pair were jailed yesterday at Sheffield Crown Court for orchestrating the nationwide charity scam.

The couple’s bogus collections took place in pubs, stores such as Toys R Us, at football matches and supermarkets including Sainsburys, Morrisons, Tesco and the Co-op.

They even set up a bank account under a false business name to process their ill-gotten gains while living on benefits at a modest council semi in Arbourthorne, Sheffield.

A total of £287,000 went through their various accounts - but as they collected cash it was impossible to pin down just how much they made dishonestly, the court heard.

Richard Sheldon, prosecuting, said: ‘They collected up and down the country from members of the public but kept all the cash they received for themselves.

‘It was organised, systematic and very lucrative. Hotels were booked and paid for in various parts of the country to enable the fraud to be carried out. This was organised crime.’ Sheffield Crown Court heard Mr Moore, 45, had been married to Mrs Moore, 39, for 20 years.

He was the driving force behind the scam and had never worked a day in his life. He relied solely on money obtained either through the scam or from benefits.

Mr Sheldon said: ‘His only source of income was crime and benefits or whatever monies she earned, whether legitimately or fraudulently.

‘He backed up his position with violence and she travelled up and down the country to make collections which were passed to him.’ The couple splashed out 27,000 Euros over a year on a rent-to-buy scheme for a four-bedroom luxury detached Lanzarote villa with its own swimming pool which they called ‘Villa Moore’ and 4,250 Euros on a car.

Their house was furnished with household gadgets and a chaise longue for 3,399 Euros.

Mr Moore even used the money for the dying children to indulge in his favourite pastime of gambling.

The Moores would stage fake collections for a period in the UK then jet off to Lanzarote or the United States for lengthy holidays with the proceeds.

Detective Constable Gareth Rees who led investigations into the fraud said afterwards: ‘Glen just sits back in his armchair and concocts schemes to make whatever money he can. In my view Lynne was just as culpable. They were 50-50 responsible for what happened.’ Mr Moore, who absconded and is believed to be living abroad, went on trial in his absence.

He was found guilty of fraud offences after a three-day trial while his wife pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing.

They were each convicted of four joint offences of fraud and one of acquiring criminal property.

Mr Moore was jailed for seven-and-a-half years in his absence and Mrs Moore for four-and-a-half years.

Handing down the sentences the judge Recorder Simon Batiste said: ‘These are in any view despicable offences.’ He said the couple had organised bogus collections on an ‘industrial scale’ and added: ‘This was deliberate targeting of a large number of vulnerable victims. They were sophisticated offences and there was considerable planning.’ Their scam began after Mrs Moore became a registered collector for the well-known London-based charity Tommy’s in 2000 which saves babies’ lives by funding research into miscarriages, still and premature births.

After seeing public generosity first-hand the couple decided they wanted a part of it.

The last donation Mrs Moore made to Tommy’s was £1,125 in November, 2004 yet for several years afterwards she went up and down the country with collecting tins for the charity.

When Tommy’s organisers became suspicious, Mrs Moore was blacklisted. But the couple simply carried on by setting up a bogus charity in Sheffield in late 2010 called Enabled, which was supposed to raise money for terminally ill and disabled children.

It appeared there was only one beneficiary - an eight-year-old boy who could not talk and had to be fed by tube. His mother was given a second-hand ipad by the couple to make it look legitimate.

One Enabled staff member was sacked for failing to reach the couple’s collection target of £1,000 a week.

The couple opened a bogus bank account in Edinburgh, telling the bank it was for a catering firm.

Police were called in following an anonymous tip and the Enabled offices were raided.

At the Moores’ Sheffield home, detectives found Tommy’s collecting tins, badges and literature and a revealing diary kept by Mrs Moore.

The couple were arrested but skipped bail and fled to Spain before returning but Mr Moore has since fled again.

Officers combing the books could find no legitimate source of income to explain the large deposits in the couple’s various bank accounts.

Over a six-year period, from 2005 to 2011, police discovered £139,581 went through Mrs Moore’s accounts, £77,880 in Mr Moore’s accounts and from 2009 to 2010 in the ‘Coffee House’ accounts, £69,552.

During this time Mrs Moore only earned a few thousand pounds from low-paid restaurant jobs.

When arrested, Mr Moore claimed allegations he had a lavish lifestyle abroad were ‘funny and hilarious’.

In her diary on April 10, 2009 Mrs Moore wrote: ‘Don’t know what to do. Just want to do what is right and legal. Sick of lies and conning people.’ While in Lanzarote on May 3 that year she wrote: “Don’t want to live here. I don’t belong here. Glen punched my arm three times and had a knife to my throat wish never met him.’ She said of the bogus collecting: ‘I didn’t really want to do it.’ She sobbed in court when it was put to her that both children and adults had been defrauded but added: ‘I did it for my own safety.’

The court heard Mr Moore had previously served several jail terms for burglary and importing drugs, while his wife has several convictions for deception.
