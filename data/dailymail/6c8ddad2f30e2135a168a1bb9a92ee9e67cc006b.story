She may be famed for her washboard stomach slender thighs, but Cheryl Cole says she doesn't follow a diet and swears her favourite food is 'anything sweet'.

Speaking to FeelUnique.com, the brunette songstress said: 'I don’t follow any strict diets, I just 
eat sensibly.

'I’m not eating McDonald’s or pizza every day but I do 
allow myself one cheat day a week, normally on a Sunday. I have a really
sweet tooth and love cupcakes, doughnuts. Basically anything that’s 
really bad for you.'

How does she do it! Cheryl Cole says she loves anything that's bad for her and has weekly cheat days where she eats doughnuts and cupcakes

To burn off her sweet treats, the 30-year-old sticks to a gruelling exercise regime.

Cheryl says she swears by the Tracy Anderson Method - the plan created by the author and multi-platform wellness entrepreneur whose clients also include Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow - to keep her body in shape.

Cheryl explained that she uses the Tracy Anderson DVD at home to tone up and help maintain her much-envied abs.

As well as possessing a finely honed physique, Cheryl also regularly tops Most Beautiful Woman polls - an honour she still can't get her head around.

'I still don’t get why people call me a beauty icon. It’s so flattering, don’t get me wrong, but I just don’t get it,' she said.

Citing 'stunning' Marilyn Monroe as her icon, Cheryl maintains that she'd never wear a full face of make-up if she had the day off, saying that she couldn't think of anything worse.

Instead, she swears by a BB cream (being the spokesmodel for L'Oreal she shows her brand loyalty by using their Paris Skin Perfection 5-in-1 Instant Complexion Correcting Beauty Balm) which she complements with a slick of mascara before heading out of the door.

Her top tip is to remove make-up at the end of the day with a face cloth to make sure every last trace is gone, and to use good night creams (Cheryl uses L'Oreal's Paris Skin Perfection Advanced Correcting Serum and Magic Touch Instant Blur), because that's when skin has time to regenerate and repair itself, she says.

The star says that her mother Joan, with whom she is famously close, really does know best.

'The beauty advice my mum gave me was to just to go with what works for you.

'Work with your natural beauty and don’t try something just because it works on someone else, go for what works for you,' she adds.
