TV personality Kate Humble has revealed that she never wanted children but loves her large family of animals.

The forty-five-year-old nature presenter has also admitted that one of her greatest pleasures in life is dancing with her husband - fully naked.

'I never ever wanted kids,' Kate said.

But the presenter's home life is far from quiet, with a house full of pets. She has three dogs, assorted 
chickens, ducks, geese, 10 ewes and lambs.

On her 117-acre farm she keeps more sheep and chickens, ducks, geese, goats and two breeding sows, which she admits she agreed to buy when she was 'a little bit drunk'.

'We usually get up at 6am to feed the 
animals, but people with children think that's a lie in. And, although 
you can't really ignore your animals, they don't bounce on your bed like
 children,' she joked.

Kate moved to Monmouthshire seven years ago with her husband of 22 years, Ludo Graham, 53.

'I've fancied Ludo since I was 16,' she told The People, and admits that the couple love to indulge in a naked dance.

'There's something joyous about it, and I
 urge everyone to try it,' she said. 'My husband and I danced naked 
in the middle of the desert in Jordan once.

'If you can't get your kicks 
in that incredibly innocent, joyful way, then the world is not a good 
place. It's my eccentric, barking mad way of getting closer to nature.'

The presenter, whose next trip is to Siberia to live with reindeer herders at minus 40 degrees, said she doesn't expect to win best-dressed presenter any time soon and joked that the worst dressed gong is more likely to come her way.

She also revealed that her and her TV producer husband often run out of clean clothes and with the outdoorsy nature of her job, they share some very unglamorous moments.

Kate divulged that during one intimate moment on a recent wedding anniversary, her husband discovered that she'd caught fleas. She'd spent the day sitting on the forest floor and her back was covered in spots from the little critters.

She also had spiders lay eggs in her toe after a trip to Africa. The presenter went to A&E after her toe became painful and it turned out there was a big egg sac growing in her foot.

Given the wild nature of her work, Kate feels no pressure to keep up with ‘autocutie’ presenters and newsreaders.

She's previously admitted: ‘I’ve never been a dressy sort of person. I’m not interested in clothes and fashion.

'You want to look reasonable, but most of the time the programmes I do are not about me. I am a conduit for information, nothing more.

‘If I was there in a dress that shows half my t*** and most of my a***, it would be pointless.’
