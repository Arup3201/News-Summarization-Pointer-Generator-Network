Jonathan Trott fell for a duck as England Lions were bowled out for 260 in the first innings of their second unofficial Test against South Africa A at Bloemfontein.

Captain Trott had been the hero of the drawn first match with an unbeaten 211 but little went right after he won the toss and chose to bat first.

Trott was at the crease sooner than he would have expected after Sam Robson and Alex Lees both fell for five to Rory Kleinveldt.

And the 33-year-old lasted only four balls before turning a delivery from Chris Morris to leg slip as England slumped to 16 for three.

Opener Adam Lyth steadied the ship alongside James Vince, the pair adding 66, while Jonny Bairstow then joined fellow Yorkshireman Lyth to repair more of the damage.

But Lyth's innings was ended at 65 by Stiaan van Zyl, and in the next over Bairstow was bowled by Kleinveldt for 47.

That left the tourists in trouble once again at 164 for six, and they were grateful to another Yorkshire duo, Adil Rashid and Liam Plunkett, for helping them reach 260.

The pair put on 47 runs either side of tea before Plunkett fell for 24, and Rashid then saw Mark Wood and debutant Adam Riley depart quickly.

He found a useful ally in the shape of Boyd Rankin, who stood firm at one end as Rashid notched up his second consecutive half-century, top-scoring with 68 before he was caught behind off Morris.

England needed a good start to the South Africa innings and they made it, Wood bowling Van Zyl with only one run on the scoreboard.

The hosts survived the rest of the day unscathed, though, and will resume on 29 for one with Reeza Hendricks unbeaten on 20.
