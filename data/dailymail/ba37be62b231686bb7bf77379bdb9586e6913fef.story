We all like to catch a few rays, but this photographer managed to get hundreds when a huge school streamed past him as he was diving.

Free-diver Eduardo Lopéz Negrete even managed to snatch a selfie with the mobula rays in the background.

The fish, a smaller cousin of the manta ray, can reach 17 feet across and weigh up to 12 stone. They are famous for breaching, leaping up to six feet into the air.

Fishy business: Mobula rays can reach 17 feet across and weigh up to 12 stone

Negrete, 36, from Mexico City took the incredible pictures while on a trip off the coast of Baja, where he was helping to unhook sharks caught in fisherman's long-lines.

To get the shots he had to free-dive down to 60 feet.

Negrete said: 'We were lucky enough to run into a massive school of mobula rays.

'The rays were moving quite fast and it was hard enough keeping up with them from the surface, let alone dive down to take a closer look.

'I took the photos free-diving to a depth of about 60 feet. It was an amazing experience that humbled us all.

Speedy: Negrete said that the mobula rays were moving very quickly and he struggled to keep up with them

'I even managed to get a selfie free-diving with the mobulas. I must say, it is the only type of selfie I am into, those with amazing marine life in the background.'

He added: 'We were on a trip to unhook live sharks from fishermen's longlines for a project called The Call of the Shark from Pelagic Life, a Mexican Non-Governmental Organisation that I form part of.

'We are trying to set up shark-diving tourism and persuade local fisherman to take divers out to the sharks rather than kill them.

'The first day of the trip we were able to unhook a beautiful mako shark from a long-line and it was on the following day that we saw the rays.'

Although his day job is as a Chief Finance Officer for a company, Negrete was brought up on the island of Cozumel in the Caribbean where his father ran a dive and marine sports operation.

He said: 'I have been obsessed with the ocean and its beauty ever since.

'I don't get to spend as much time in the ocean as I would like since I live in Mexico City, but I have two beautiful boys, to whom I hope I can pass down my deep love and concern for our oceans.'
