The Jurassic Coast in Dorset has been packed with treasure hunters since a giant marine reptile fossil worth £15,000 was found on a beach on Boxing Day.

People come from all over the country for a day's fossil hunting along Britain's Jurassic Coast - a 96-mile-long world heritage site, which gets its name from its cliffs which were formed 180 million years ago.

The near-complete ichthyosaur skeleton was discovered by hobby collector Alan Saxon, from Chippenham in Wiltshire, who was on a post-Christmas visit to the Jurassic Coast.

The Jurassic Cliffs at Charmouth in Dorset have never been more busy since a fossil worth £15,000 was found on the beach on Boxing Day

Find: The skeleton - which is about 5ft long - can be seen at the base of Black Ven ner Charmouth

The 1.5m (5ft) fossil was uncovered due to heavy storms and was found at the base of Black Ven near Charmouth. 

The
 giant marine reptile fossil was painstakingly removed over eight hours 
and professional fossil hunter Paul Crossley, who helped excavate it, 
said it was 'a beautiful find'.

Mr Crossley told the BBC:
 'The word is already out that Lyme Regis is the capital of fossil 
hunting at the moment, we've seen more people than normal on the 
beaches.

'We always advise going when the tide is falling and always stay well away from the cliffs and mudslides. Use common sense.'

Fossil-hunting is big business. Fossils - the remains of dead organisms preserved in rocks - can fetch millions.

But scientists are increasingly concerned 
that the lucrative market in dinosaur remains is driving a booming 
illicit trade in fossil poaching.

Many
 experts claim that these irreplaceable ancient treasures, which are 
vital for our understanding of Earth's history, are ending up not in 
laboratories or museums but on the walls of business HQs, Russian 
oligarchs' mansions and even, in one case, the bottom of a Japanese 
billionaire's swimming pool.

On
 the Jurassic Coast, a fossil-collecting code allows the removal of 
fossils provided the cliff-face is not damaged, and the code requires 
rockhounds to notify the authorities only if a particularly important 
find is made.

People come from all over the UK for a days fossil hunting on the beach especially on a sunny weekend

In April the remains of a 195-million-year-old reptile were discovered on the Jurassic Coast.

Geologist
 Richard Edmonds stumbled across the 18-inch fossil of an ichthyosaur - a
 dolphin-like sea creature - near Lyme Regis.

Mr
 Edmonds spotted a small part of the perfectly-preserved jaw of the 
extinct reptile sticking out of the mud - and said he almost ignored it.

But on closer inspection the 50-year-old fossil hunter realised it was a full ichthyosaur jaw.
