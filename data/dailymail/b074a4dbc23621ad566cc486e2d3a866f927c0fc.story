Pressure is mounting to ban a highly concentrated alcohol from Australian shelves, following the tragic death of a teenage girl at her 18th birthday party.

Nicole Bicknell, from Thornlie in Perth's south-east, only had a couple of shots of  Polish-made alcohol Polmos Spirytus Rektyfikowany, which has an alcohol content of 95 per cent, two weeks ago before she died just a few hours later.

The family told Perth Now the young woman had only had a few mixed drinks before being offered the spirit by a male friend.

While the family is still waiting on the official report for the cause of Nicole's death, they believe drinking the Polish spirit was what killed her and are now advocating for a complete ban of the sale of high strength alcohol in Australia.

'I cannot see why alcohol so strong is sold in liquor stores,' grandfather Kevin McLean told News Corp.

'No one needs to buy alcohol that strong. It should be taken off the shelves so this doesn’t happen to any other family.

'We want it banned Australia-wide and we would like to see it an offence to sell it.' 

Australian Drug Foundation's Geoff Munroe told Daily Mail Australia it was 'extraordinary' the Polish spirit did not come with a warning.

'There's no warning on the bottle but there's a warning on cough mixture that says you shouldn't drink alcohol or drive a motor car [when you take it] as well as a warning on aspirin,' he said.

'Alcohol is the only lethal product I can think of where a manufacturer does not have to provide a warning.

'It's extraordinary the alcohol industry refuses to warn its own customers and it's astonishing they get away with it.' 

It is believed the Australian Medical Association tried to ban the alcohol a couple of years ago but were unsuccessful.

'It's a poison, a toxin that can cause outright liver damage and kills the cells and also has a direct suppressive effect on the brain,' Australian Medical Association member Dr Brain Mawson said.

'It also has an effect on our hearts, can induce arrhythmia in regular heart beats, a lethal irregular heartbeat.'

While he admits that Australians need to look at their own attitude towards consuming alcohol, citing most think it's acceptable to have too many, highly concentrated alcohol should have better labelling.

'Its true content needs to be in a larger print or have diagrams as an easy way for people to understand [alcohol content].'

The Polish spirit is 95% alcohol and online alcohol retailers warn consumers to drink it diluted

And while he's not all for a complete ban on high strength alcohol, Dr. Mawson says we should maybe look at doing the same thing as we do with cigarettes.

'A lock and key to ask for it,' he said. 

Polmos Spirytus Rektyfikowany 

* Rectified spirit from Poland

* Mainly produced from grain

* 95% alcohol concentration (190 proof)

* Effectively a pure spirit

* Used for medicinal purposes, household solvent

* Recommended drunk chilled, diluted

* 500ml, $55-$70 pricetag (online and shelf) 

Spirytus Rektyfikowany is what is known as a rectified spirit from Poland and is often used as a base for liqueurs and other infusions.

A 500ml bottle equals about 38 standard drinks, more than double the potentially lethal dose for an average adult.

It is believed to have medicinal purposes and can be used as a household solvent.

A number of online alcohol sites that stock the highly concentrated drink warn people it should be diluted when consumed and is not recommended to be consumed on its own.

When Daily Mail Australia called Dan Murphy's liquor store, a customer service representative confirmed the brand had been discontinued most likely because of its high concentration of alcohol.

The representative said it was the only rectified liquor that Dan Murphy's stocked and it was now off the shelves although some independent stores would most likely still stock it.

It iss believed Woolworths Liquor group have pulled the potent alcohol off its shelves 

It is believed the Woolworths Liquor group have also pulled the potent alcohol off its shelves and when Daily Mail Australia tried to search for the brand at chains, such as Coles' Liquorland website, it revealed there was none available.

Wineanthology.com said this extraordinarily strong spirit needed to be treated with respect.

'It is questionable whether the human body is meant to digest such strong substances,' it said on its website.

'Being effectively pure ethyl-alcohol, it is more commonly used in cooking, in the preparation of fruit and herb tinctures, for medicinal purposes, or by home perfume makers.'

Ms Bicknell's death came before the Western Australian government passed laws which will see adults face criminal prosecution for supplying juveniles with alcohol.

From next year, anyone who buys alcohol on behalf of a minor in the state will run the risk of 'tough' penalties, Racing and Gaming Minister Terry Waldron said. 

The penalties are yet to be determined but the laws will also allow parents, guardians or anyone who has their consent to responsibly supply drinks to juveniles on unlicensed premises such as private homes.
