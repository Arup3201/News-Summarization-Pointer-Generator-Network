Tennis star: Andy Murray today revealed he would play for Scotland if it became independent

With only 20 days left until polls open, the campaign for Scottish independence has sparked huge political debate across Britain.

And now, tennis star Andy Murray has revealed that he would play for Scotland if it became independent.

The 27-year-old, who was born in Glasgow and grew up in Dunblane, said he would represent his country even if it opts to leave the UK in the 2014 referendum.

But he added that he does not believe independence is likely to happen.

Speaking of the 2016 Olympics, Murray told MailOnline: 'If it happened where, if Scotland became independent, then I imagine I would be playing for Scotland.'

But he added: 'I haven't thought much about that yet because I don't think it's looking too likely that it's going to happen.

'Ever since I started travelling to tournaments aged 11, I played under Great Britain. When I travelled to team events or overseas, we were always Great Britain. That's normal to me.

'But if it did happen [if Scotland became independent], then it would be pretty much the first time in my life that I have represented Scotland.'

Murray, who has famously refused to endorse either side of the argument in the referendum, said he has followed the debate 'very closely'.

He said: 'I watched 45 minutes of the second [television] debate . But I didn't see the first one.  I'm not going into that. I don't want to talk about politics here. I'll worry about my tennis.'

Since his rise to fame, Murray's national identity has been widely commented on by the British media.

In
 2006, the sportsman provoked a backlash when he joked that he 
would support 'anyone but England' in the football World Cup, a remark he said he later regretted.

Narrower lead: Following the TV debate, a poll by the Scottish Daily Mail revealed the
 No campaign still has a six-point lead over the Yes campaign, but that 
is down from a 14-point lead enjoyed just three weeks ago

And during a cameo appearance on comedy show Outnumbered, he was asked whether he considers himself to be British or Scottish. Murray responded: 'It depends if I'm winning.' 

Yesterday, the
 tennis player eased his way into the third round of the US Open by 
defeating Germany's Matthias Bachinger 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.

It comes as Alistair 
Darling’s poor performance in the second television debate on Scottish independence has given a huge boost 
to Alex Salmond’s campaign.

The debate
 on Monday, which was watched by more than two million people, was
 a disaster for the No campaign, which saw its lead narrow sharply.

A poll by the Scottish Daily Mail revealed the pro-Union Better Together campaign led by Mr Darling still enjoys a six percentage point lead over the independence supporters among decided voters.

But this is down from the 14-point lead it had after the first debate three weeks ago.

If the shift in support towards the Nationalists continues at the same rate until polling day on September 18, it would see Scotland vote to leave the UK, ending the 300-year-old union.

The poll results came as David Cameron warned that one million jobs rely on the Union and urged, ‘Let’s stay together.’

The Prime Minister said: ‘I want to talk about the business case for Scotland in the UK, something which matters to every man, woman and child in our country.

‘Our economy’s first great advantage is opportunity – the opportunity that comes from a domestic market of 60million people and nearly five million businesses.

‘This is one of the oldest and most successful single markets in the world. But if we pull that apart, if we make foreigners of our neighbours, business becomes tougher, trade becomes more costly and complex, and jobs become harder to find.’
