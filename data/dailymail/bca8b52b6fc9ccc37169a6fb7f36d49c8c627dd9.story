Parents of a woman who was viciously bashed and left for dead have made a desperate plea to find the culprit of the senseless act.

Paul and Lesley, who want to withhold their surnames, discovered their daughter, Tonia, unconscious, brutally beaten and partially naked in her Lawson Place home in Munster, Perth on July 25.

The 37-year-old, who could have been lying there for up to three days, is paralysed down her left side and completely blind.

 Tonia was so badly beaten that she has been left paralysed down her left side and completely blind

Tonia is a professional chef and had just started her own beef jerky business before she was viciously attacked

Her father, Paul, said there were no words to describe the heinous attack on his daughter

The doctors don't know if Tonia will ever recover full sight.

'Who could do this?' her father Paul asked. 'There are no words - it's very confronting.'

'Its just so horrific - a cowardly act has caused her now to not have much of a life anymore,' her mother Lesley added.

Tonia was rushed to Royal Perth Hospital with bleeding on the brain and was in a coma for weeks - and doctors were forced to remove part of her skull.

The assault is largely still a mystery but evidence indicates Tonia was hit on the head with a hard blunt object.

Her memory has also been damaged as her parents have to often remind their daughter why she is crippled.

Tonia is a professional chef and had just started her own beef jerky business before she was viciously attacked.

She has a long road ahead of her and it is not known if she will ever fully recover. She is currently doing an intensive rehabilitation program to try to regain some movement of her left side.

'We need to find out who did this,' her mother pleaded.

Police are searching for a man seen around her home on July 22 and is believed to have left the area driving a grey/blue sedan.

He has been described as about 40 years-old, fair skin, stocky build and 178 cm tall with a shaved or bald head. 

Her mother, Lesley, pleaded for people to help with information to find her daughter's attacker
