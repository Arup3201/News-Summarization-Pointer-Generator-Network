Former WWE wrestler Jake ‘The Snake’ Roberts has announced he has cancer.

Roberts, 58, will undergo emergency surgery on Tuesday to remove a tumor behind his knee, he told TMZ.

The Snake noticed the tumor, about the size of a half dollar, last month and had it tested, he told the site.

Results came back Monday and doctors urged him to have it operated on immediately because it is growing into his muscle tissue, he explained.

The operation was scheduled for Tuesday morning, but he told the site he expects to make a March 14 Jersey Championship Wrestling event.

‘If the devil can't defeat me, cancer doesn't stand a chance in hell! Pray for sick children who face this horrible disease 'cause The Snake will be just fine,’ said Roberts.

He also vowed to make it to New Orleans later this year for his induction into the WWE Hall of Fame.Roberts last performed in the WWE in 1997, when it was still known as the WWF.
