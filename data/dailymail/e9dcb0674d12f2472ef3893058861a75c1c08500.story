A suburban Detroit man who killed an unarmed woman on his porch is being sued for more than $10 million.

The parents of 19-year-old Renisha McBride filed their lawsuit against Theodore Wafer on Tuesday in Wayne County Circuit Court. A jury convicted the 55-year-old Wafer of second-degree murder on Aug. 7. He'll be sentenced Sept. 3.

Wafer shot McBride in the face in November at his Dearborn Heights home. He says he acted in self-defense after hearing pounding at his doors.

Mlive.com reports that he feared for his life but never meant to shoot her and didn't believe the gun was loaded.

He said he hoped to scare away what he thought were multiple people trying to break into his home.

McBride had crashed her car hours before and an autopsy found she was drunk.

Monica McBride and Walter Simmons accuse Wafer of wrongful death and negligence in their daughter's killing.

Wafer's lawyer, Cheryl Carpenter, tells WWJ-AM that her client has no money because of the cost of his defense.
