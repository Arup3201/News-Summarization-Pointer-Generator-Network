Virginia state Senator Creigh Deeds has come forward to reveal his final moments with his son Gus, nearly a year after the mentally-ill young man tried to kill him in a knife attack.

On November 18, 2013 Deeds obtained an emergency custody order to admit his suicidal son to a psychiatric ward, but that order expired before they could find him a bed at any hospital 

The following morning, Deeds was feeding his horses when his 21-year-old son approached and suddenly started stabbing him with a knife.

Deeds, now 56, says his last words to Gus were 'I love you so much' and that after uttering the statement, Gus let up and he was able to make his escape.

Turned away: Gus was attacked by his son after failing to commit him to a hospital the night before.

Deeds ran away from the house where he was rescued and taken to the hospital. Police later found Gus dead from a self-inflicted gun shot wound.

His daughter Susannah and second wife Siobahn believe it was those words of compassion that saved Deeds' life.  

'I like to believe what Susannah said - that when I said "I love you," that broke through,' Deeds told the Washington Post. 'That he was still delusional, but that did break through, and the old Gus heard that. Not the old Gus — Gus. That those things that had taken over Gus were defeated.'

Still, Deeds admits he may never know the real truth behind his son's  motivations that day and he's still haunted by what he could have done differently to prevent Gus' suicide. 

Gus first started showing signs of mental illness after his first year at the College of William and Mary, when he got dumped by a girlfriend after visiting her in her native Colombia. 

But he continued to do well in school, making the Dean's List. He took the fall of his junior year off to help on his dad's gubernatorial campaign. When that campaign failed, and his parent's broke up, Gus went on a cross-country road trip, writing bad checks along the way and getting baptized in Oregon.

His father found the trip strange, but figured it wasn't altogether unusual for a young person. 

Gus' parents became more concerned when he took of another semester in the spring of 2010 to work in Gary, Indiana.  His mother took him for a psychological evaluation and Gus was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. However, doctors were optimistic and believed he wouldn't need to be medicated his whole life. 

'I believed in Gus,' Deeds said. 'I believed he would snap out of it.' 

'I’m not sure I’ve met anybody like him,' Deeds remembers. 'He was all the things I wanted to be. I’m not smart, not good at anything, not coordinated, can’t sing, no musical-instrument ability, no gift for languages, and he had all that. I don’t have any of the confidence he displayed at every moment.'

But Gus didn't get better, and eventually started talking about suicide with his dad. 

'He’d say, "I just feel like I’m going to end it,"' Deeds said. 'He’d say, "Dad, I feel like I want to die."'

While Gus had supported his dad on previous occasions when he was committed to a hospital, Deeds could tell something had changed the night before the stabbing when he took out an emergency order again.

At the hospital, where Deeds failed to find his son a bed, Gus paced back and forth. And in the car ride home, he was completely silent.

'I know he felt I betrayed him when I went and got the order,' Deeds says. 'I don’t feel I had a choice. I did what I did to try to save him.'

Deeds' wife told him to leave the house for the night, but Deeds decided he wanted to stay with his son. However, for the first time ever, he locked his bedroom door at night and even heard Gus rattling the door knob trying to get in.

Still, Deeds never thought his son would actually kill him. 

The next morning, Deeds got up to shower before Gus woke up and started his day as usual, feeding the horses.

When he saw his son approaching, Deeds asked him how he slept and Gus responded 'fine'.  

'I turned my back and... had this feed thing in my hands and he was just on me... He got me twice,' Deeds recalled in a 60 Minutes interview earlier this year. 

Deeds doesn't remember much from the frenzied attack, in which he suffered 10 stab wounds all over his body.

Shortly after telling his son how much he loved him, Gus eased up. Deeds still isn't certain that those words impacted his son.

'Maybe he figured he did the damage he needed to do to kill me,' he said. 'Maybe he’d seen enough blood.'

Either way, Deeds escaped and ran down to the road where he was found by a neighbor and taken to the hospital.  

His son returned to the house and shot himself dead with a gun Deeds never feared he would use since he couldn't find ammunition to buy for it. He's still not sure how Gus was able to source the hard-to-find bullets.

Still a state senator, Deeds has now made mental health reform his top priority, and has already extended the window of emergency custody orders from six hours to 12.
