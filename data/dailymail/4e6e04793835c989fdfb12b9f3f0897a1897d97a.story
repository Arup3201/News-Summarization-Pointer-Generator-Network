England have been caught up in a fresh team-sheet embarrassment.

Just three days after sponsors Vauxhall tweeted a team-sheet which included players’ passport numbers, the line-ups ahead of Saturday’s game against Honduras named the suspended Raheem Sterling among the substitutes.

Blunder: The suspended Raheem Sterling was named among the subs on the team-sheet

Sidelined: The injured Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Sterling sat out of the game against Honduras

Seeing red: Sterling was sent off during the 2-2 draw with Ecuador on Wednesday

The Liverpool forward was sent off during the 2-2 draw with Ecuador on Wednesday night, picking up a one-game ban to be served against the Hondurans.

But the official team-sheet at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami included Sterling on the bench but had no place for Jack Wilshere, despite the Arsenal midfielder warming up on the pitch.

Manager Roy Hodgson has indicated that Sterling would have started the game, hinting at his involvement for the World Cup opener against Italy next weekend.

Passport numbers, incidentally, were not published on the team-sheet ahead of the Honduras game.
