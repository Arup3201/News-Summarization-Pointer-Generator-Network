They are the brightly-coloured clogs with signature aeration holes most commonly spotted on middle class mothers doing the school run.

And whilst they enjoyed huge success when they burst onto the footwear market back in 2007 thanks to their comfortable style, Crocs haven't maintained that success in recent times

Last month, the brand reported a 43 percent decline in second-quarter profits, and their stock fell by nearly a quarter in one day.

Out of fashion: They have long been the Marmite of the fashion world and now Crocs have seen earnings fall

Despite selling £630 million of shoes in
2011 and £739 million in 2012, the first quarter of 2013 saw earnings 
fall by 42.5 per cent compared to the previous year, which the company blame on colder-than-normal weather and decreased consumer interest.

And last Thursday, shareholders suffered another blow after it was reported that analysts from brokerage Stern Agee downgraded the company from 'neutral' to 'underperform'.

Sam Poser, the analyst who wrote the report for Stern Agee, cited reasons for this rating as reduced earnings expectations and concerns over the senior executive leadership, according to The Daily Beast.

He wrote: 'Unfortunately, it appears that those who concur with the top executives remain at the company, at the expense of numerous talented people who have left.'

Losing their appeal: Despite selling £630 million of the shoes, which were credited for their comfortable style, in 2011 and £739 million in 2012, the first quarter of 2013 saw earnings fall by 42.5

Overhaul: In an attempt to win over the fash pack, the brand have recently had a style overhaul and redesigned the original £29.99 Crocs to give them a more stylish appeal

Ultimately, it is the end of Crocs’ hypergrowth, and their stock has fallen by about half in the past two years.

In an attempt to win over the fash pack, the brand have recently had a style overhaul and redesigned the original £29.99 Crocs to give them a wider appeal.

Fashion writer Nicole Mowbray said: 'Crocs should stop pretending to be cool and stick to what they do best — comfortable clogs. Or simply publicise how comfortable all their shoes are, rather than bleating on that they’re stylish.

'In the Seventies, supporters of Millwall Football Club used to chant: ‘Nobody likes us, we don’t care.’

'Perhaps they’re words the million-dollar Crocs company would do well to listen to.'

Fashion blogger Lydia Faye Jones added: 'I'm a girl with a serious shoe obsession, however thankfully Crocs have never been one of them.

'The shapeless chunky style and hideous array of colours are why I'm not surprised the demand for Crocs has rapidly decreased!

'They have never been fashionable and it looks like now they never will be.'

Famous fans: The quirky footwear is loved by celebrities such as Brooke Shields and Whoopi Goldberg

Crocs CEO John McCarvel said: 'Crocs,
in fact, is alive and kicking. Our transformation to a diversified, 
four-season lifestyle footwear brand is still on track. 

'We are a very different company 
today compared with five years ago – more than 300 different footwear 
styles, more than 500 of our own branded retail stores, better wholesale
relationships, a very strong balance sheet, and more competitive cost 
structures – and global consumer demand for our products remains very 
strong. 

'We’re on track to sale approximately 55 million pairs of shoes around the world this year.'
