A Montgomery County man has been arrested after confessing to a TV news crew that he set a house fire the station was covering.

WJLA-TV was at the scene of an active Rockville house fire on Wednesday when a man who identified himself as Carlos walked up and said: 'Me. Me. I set it on fire.'

The man said he wanted to bring attention to deplorable living conditions inside the home. He said he had complained about the conditions to police but that they didn’t take them seriously.

Damage to the property is estimated at $400,000 and the house is likely a loss.

WJLA reports the man nonchalantly answered several questions from the reporter abot how he did it. 

'I just poured gasoline on the floor, set it on fire, went to grab a drink, and came back,' he said. 

'Just so you [the media] could get here....for your attention,' he added. 

The man then walked up to two Rockville police officers and told them he set the fire. They arrested him.

The moment of his confession to police was also caught on camera as astonished officers looked on. 

'Carlos' also confessed to stunned police at the scene, who immediately took him into custody

Once at the police station, however, 'Carlos' was reportedly less talkative and asked for an attorney.

Police say the man was among six people living in the home. No one was injured.

Damage to the property is estimated at $400,000 and the house is likely a loss. 

Local woman Linda Ekizian said there were police cars outside the house fairly often.

'I'm just thinking about all of the firefighters whose lives were put in jeopardy because of this. There's no excuse for it, none at all,' she said.
