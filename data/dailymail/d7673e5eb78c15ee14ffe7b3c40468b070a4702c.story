Microsoft has been forced to pull its latest Windows software update from the official store after customers claimed it caused their devices to freeze.

The company removed the RT 8.1 update from the Windows Store over the weekend, and although it didn't give specific details about what is causing the problems, did say it was investigating. 

In place of the update, Microsoft posted an apology for the problem and said it's trying to resolve the situation quickly.

Windows RT 8.1 is a scaled-down version 
of the full Windows operating system and was designed for a selection of Windows RT machines. It runs 
built-in apps and apps downloaded from the Windows Store, but not full programs.

Affected devices include the Microsoft Surface RT tablet, the Samsung ATIV Tab and other tablets that specifically run on ARM-based chips - it does not affect full Windows 8 PCs or tablets fitted with Intel chips.

The RT and full versions of the software were released on 17 October.

Shortly afterwards, RT customers began complaining the update had caused their devices to freeze during start up. 

The 8.1 update for Internet Explorer was also found to cause problems with loading Outlook webpages, and caused Google searches to appear squashed up against the left-hand side of the screen.

To solve the IE 11 problems, Microsoft has advised users to untick an option in its Settings menus that makes the browser use 'Microsoft Compatibility lists'.

In regards the general problems with the software, a spokesman for Microsoft told MailOnline: 'Microsoft is investigating a situation affecting a limited number of users updating their Windows RT devices to Windows RT 8.1.

'As a result, we have temporarily removed the Windows RT 8.1 update from the Windows Store. 

'We are working to resolve the situation as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience and will provide updates as they become available.'

Microsoft hasn't officially announced how many customers have been affected, but reports in July suggested the firm shipped around 260,000 Windows RT tablets.
