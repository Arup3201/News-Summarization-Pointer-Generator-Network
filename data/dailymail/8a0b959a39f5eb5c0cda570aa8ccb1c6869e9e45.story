Leon Osman narrowly failed to cap his testimonial with a late winner as Everton drew 1-1 with Porto at Goodison.

Osman, 33, who has been at Everton since the age of 10, had a chance to crown his big day only for a diving header to go wide.

Romelu Lukaku, Everton’s £28million signing from Chelsea, was presented to the crowd at half-time to rapturous applause but it was Muhamed  Besic, another new recruit signed from Ferencvaros for £4m, who impressed against a strong Porto side.

Everton 
opened the scoring just before  half-time against the run of play when 
Aiden McGeady pounced on a mistake in Porto’s defence to tee up Steven 
Naismith.

However, Colombian
 World Cup striker Jackson Martinez came off the bench and made an 
immediate impact to equalise for a Porto  side who controlled most of 
the game.

Osman left the pitch after 86 minutes to a standing ovation. Everton face Celta Vigo at Tranmere on Wednesday.
