Secondary schools should prepare children for adulthood by focusing on pornography, sex abuse and homosexuality, the schools watchdog has said.

Too much time is being spent on the ‘mechanics’ of reproduction and not on ‘controversial issues’, according to Ofsted.

Children are being left at risk of exploitation and inappropriate behaviour because they are learning about contraception, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases but not ‘sexual content and the influence of pornography’.

Two-fifths of schools are failing to provide pupils with the information they need in personal, social, health and economic education classes, inspectors said in a report.

The comments follow an announcement last week by the Sex Education Forum, which represents dozens of charities including the NSPCC, that PSHE lessons should be used to tell children ‘not all pornography is bad’.

Ofsted’s report said: ‘In secondary schools... too much emphasis was placed on “the mechanics” of reproduction and too little on relationships, sexuality, the influence of pornography on students’ understanding of healthy sexual relationships, dealing with emotions and staying safe.’

It continued: ‘The failure to include discussion of pornography is concerning as research shows that children as young as nine are increasingly accessing pornographic internet sites.’

Children, it added, complained lessons steered clear of controversial topics such as sexual abuse, pornography and homosexuality.

Primary schools were also criticised for placing ‘too much emphasis on friendships and relationships, leaving pupils ill-prepared for physical and emotional changes during puberty.’

Education Minister Elizabeth Truss confirmed in March that PSHE would not become compulsory

Secondary schools emphasised the 'mechanics' of reproduction too much, the report said

Fifty schools were inspected and 178 
young people questioned for the report, which said PSHE classes required
improvement or were inadequate in 40 per cent of schools.

‘Lack of high-quality, age-appropriate
sex and relationships education... is a concern as it may leave 
children and young people vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours 
and sexual exploitation,’ it added.

‘This
is because they have not been taught the appropriate language or 
developed the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours or know where 
to go for help.’

Education minister Elizabeth Truss confirmed in March that PSHE would not become a compulsory subject, saying schools and teachers should decide what subjects were covered in lessons.

Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, yesterday accused Ofsted of assuming ‘sex education holds the answer to the sexual exploitation of young people’.

He said: ‘Sex education that provides children with a menu of sexual options, tells them that there are no moral absolutes in the area of sexual expression, and presents contraceptive use as the mark of sexual responsibility is part of the problem, not the solution.

‘As for Ofsted’s advocacy of classroom discussions about pornography from an early age... it would introduce the concept of pornography to many children who had not encountered it before and arouse in some a curiosity to search out more pornographic material for themselves.

‘Most parents would far rather the government introduce an opt-in system to limit the risk of their children accessing sexual images online in the first place than add pornography to the school curriculum.’ The FPA, formerly the Family Planning Association, said sex education classes should be compulsory but called on parents to play a more active role in informing their children.

A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ‘Our curriculum reforms have given teachers the freedom to tailor their teaching so it meets the needs of their pupils.’
