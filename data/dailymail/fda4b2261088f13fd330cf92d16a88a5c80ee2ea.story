The British-born wife of Syrian president Bashar Assad has made a rare public appearance during a referendum in the war-torn country.

Looking glamorous in a dark grey coat and dress, Asma Assad shook hands and joked with supporters as she accompanied her husband into a voting booth.

Despite the continuing bloodshed in Syria, the government yesterday held a vote on constitutional reforms, which Assad claims will lead to multi-party parliamentary elections.

Mrs Assad, 36, a former  investment banker who grew  up in Acton, West London, has virtually disappeared from the public eye since the unrest broke out last March.

Her previous appearance was in December, when she and her two children stood alongside Assad at a pro-regime rally.

Unrest against anti-regime rebels continued this morning, prompting British Foreign Secretary
William Hague to call for more sanctions against Syria in the wake of 
continuing 'appalling' violence.

He urged EU foreign ministers meeting
in Brussels to extend current financial sanctions against members of 
the Assad regime by freezing European-held assets of the Syrian Central 
Bank.

He joined the talks following Friday's Tunis meeting of the Friends of Syria group, where U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton renewed attacks on the veto by Russia and China of a United Nations Security resolution condemning Syria.

The lack of a Security Council declaration has weakened international diplomatic efforts to end the violence. And Mr Hague warned today that the actions of Russia and China were seen as wrong 'in the eyes of the world'.

He said the issue would be taken up once more at the UN in New York later this week.

Meanwhile, the EU foreign ministers were trying to reinforce their economic measures against Syria, which already include an arms embargo, a ban on EU exports of oil and gas equipment to Syria, and visa and asset bans against more than 100 members of the ruling regime including President Assad.

Today's expected freeze on assets of the Syrian central bank is intended to help limit funding the continuing violent crackdown on the regime's opposition.

The EU foreign ministers will also endorse Friday's Tunis statement calling on the Syrian leader to step down and urging the setting up of a UN peacekeeping force.

Mr Hague dismissed yesterday's Syrian 'referendum' as of no relevance to international efforts to impose a 'diplomatic and economic stranglehold on the Assad regime' to 'choke off support for its campaign of terror'.

But the Foreign Secretary is against arming the Syrian opposition. Today, he welcome the Arab League's support and its readiness to join peacekeeping efforts, but pointed out: 'For that to work, there has to be a peace to keep.'

Asma Assad, 36, (pictured) grew up in Acton, West London where she was known as 'Emma'.

She
is the daughter of consultant cardiologist Fawaz Akhras and retired 
diplomat Sahar Otri, both Sunni Muslims, who moved from Syria to London 
in the Fifties so that her father, who is now based at the Cromwell 
Hospital and in Harley Street, could get the best possible education and
medical training.

Asma,
who holds dual citizenship, British and Syrian, was educated at a 
Church of England school in Ealing before attending a private girls’ day
school - Queen’s College, Harley Street.

From
Queen’s, where she achieved four A-levels, Asma went to King’s College 
London to read Computer Science and take a diploma in French Literature.

She graduated with a First and, after six months of travelling, joined Deutsche Bank as an analyst in hedge-fund management.

She
then moved to the investment bank JP Morgan and worked in Paris and New
York, as well as London. On family holidays back in Syria, she met 
Bashar.

Then he, too, 
came to London to study ophthalmology, though he had to leave early to 
return to Syria after his elder brother Basil, who had been the heir, 
died in a car crash.

Asma
started seeing him in secret, resigning from JP Morgan just a month 
before the wedding without being able to explain the real reason. With 
her father, she has set up several London-based charities such as the 
Syria Heritage.

Vogue 
has described her as ‘the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies’ 
and has topped French Elle’s ‘most stylish woman in politics’ list.

In Damascus, Bashar and Asma now live in a flat with plate-glass windows and their three boys go to a Montessori school.

Asma
speaks four languages and her connections with France have led her to 
persuade the Louvre to help her open Syrian cultural attractions.

Mrs Clinton has also said Syrians in the military who still support President Bashar Assad should turn against him.

Speaking at a news conference in Morocco yesterday she added: 'The longer you support the regime's campaign of violence against your brothers and sisters, the more it will stain your honour.

'If you refuse, however, to prop up the regime or take part in attacks on your fellow citizens, your countrymen and women will hail you as heroes.'

The statement came as 45 
Syrian civilians and soldiers were killed yesterday in fighting over Syria's
future that coincided with the vote on a new constitution that could keep
President Bashar Assad in power until 2028.  

The Syrian Observatory for Human 
Rights said a military bombardment of opposition districts in Homs, now 
in its fourth week, had killed nine civilians, while rebel fighters had 
killed four soldiers in clashes in the city.      

The British-based Observatory said 
eight civilians and 10 members of the security forces were killed in 
violence elsewhere in Syria, the scene of what has become an 
increasingly militarised revolt against four decades of Assad family 
rule.     

So far around 7,500 have died in her husband’s brutal crackdown.

Waleed Fares, an activist in the 
Khalidiyah district of Homs, said: 'What should we be voting for, 
whether to die by bombardment or by bullets?

'This is the only choice we have.

'We have been trapped in our houses for 23 days.

'We cannot go out, except into some alleys.

'Markets, schools and government 
buildings are closed, and there is very little movement on the streets 
because of snipers.'        

Mr Fares also said the battered district of Babo Amro has had no food or water for three days.

'Homs in general has no electricity for 18 hours a day,' he added.

With most foreign reporters barred from Syria or heavily restricted, witness reports are hard to verify.             

The outside world has been powerless 
to restrain Assad's drive to crush the 11-month-old revolt, which has 
the potential to slide into a sectarian conflict between Syria's Sunni 
Muslim majority and the president's minority Alawite sect.     

Unwilling to intervene militarily and
unable to get the U.N. Security Council to act following Russian and 
Chinese opposition, Western powers have imposed their own sanctions on 
Syria and backed an Arab League call for Assad to step down.

German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the referendum was 'nothing but a farce.' 

'Sham votes cannot contribute to a 
solution of the crisis. Assad needs to put an end to the violence and 
clear the way for a political transition,' he said in a 
statement.               

In Hama, another city with a bloody 
record of resistance to Baathist rule, one activist said nobody was 
taking part in the referendum. 'We will not vote on a constitution drafted by our killer,' he said by satellite telephone, asking not to be named.           

This is Syria's third referendum 
since Assad inherited power from his late father.  The first installed 
him as president in 2000 with an official 97.29 per cent 'Yes' vote.  The second renewed his term seven years later with 97.62 per cent in favour.
