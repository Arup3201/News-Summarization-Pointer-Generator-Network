It has taken two years, but the relationship between Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas can, at last, be declared official.

In a major step in their romance, Cressida, 25, has been invited to accompany Harry to an official engagement in the Queen’s rooms at St James’s Palace.

The Prince is to host a private dinner party in the official rooms to honour the friends he made during a 208-mile trek to the South Pole before Christmas.

The dinner will be a big moment for Cressida Bonas, right, who has been dating Prince Harry, left, for two years

Guests have been told their partners, wives and girlfriends are welcome and – according to a source – as Cressida ‘falls into that category’, she can attend too. The dinner will be held on March 27 and the source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Harry has told Cressida she is welcome to come along.’

If she accepts the invitation – as she is predicted to – it will be a significant moment for Cressida, 25, who began dating Harry in 2012.

Although she won’t officially be greeting guests, as the Duchess of Cambridge does when she accompanies Prince William to events, Cressida effectively will be the event’s co-host.

The source added: ‘Harry and his mates went through thick and thin together, so the dinner party will  be a really relaxed and jovial affair. But there is no doubt that it will be a Royal banquet, albeit a  private one.’

St James’s Palace is often in use for official functions and, with permission from the Queen, can also be used by courtiers for private events such as weddings. The State Apartments are used about 100 times a year for State visits and for hosting receptions for charities, such as the one Harry is hosting.

An aide at Clarence House insisted that as the dinner would be private it is not technically termed as an official Royal event. But the aide added: ‘The rooms in St James’s Palace are the Queen’s rooms and are only used for official engagements like receptions and dinners, including for charities.’

Another source said: ‘Because she is Harry’s girlfriend, Cressida’s very presence at a dinner hosted  by him would position her into the role of co-host.’

The invitation to accompany Harry at the dinner comes two weeks after they kissed and cuddled in full view of dozens of cameras at the We Day youth event at Wembley Arena.

Cressida has also been seen with Harry watching rugby at Twickenham, prompting commentators to note that their relationship has matured to a stage where she now feels at ease being seen with the  fourth-in-line to the throne.

Harry, 29, is the patron of the Walking With The Wounded charity, which provides rehabilitation services for military veterans overcoming life-changing injuries.

His dedication was proven beyond doubt when he spent weeks in the Antarctic on a gruelling trek with injured servicemen Duncan Slater, Ibrar Ali, Kate Philip, Conrad  Dickinson, Richard Eyre and Guy Disney, who are all invited to  the dinner.

It is believed that some of the guests have already met Cressida under less formal circumstances.
