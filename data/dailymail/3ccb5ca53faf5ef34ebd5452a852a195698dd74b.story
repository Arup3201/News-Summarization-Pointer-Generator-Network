Tony Blair has refused to rule out working for President Putin as he defended making millions from advising some of the world’s worst despots.

Rejecting claims that he has no credibility as a Middle East peace envoy or international advisor after taking Britain into the Iraq War under false pretences, he also argued he now understands the world better than do western governments - who should ‘listen to me’.

Mr Blair’s extraordinary remarks were made in an interview with Vanity Fair in which he defended the considerable wealth he has accrued since leaving office while insisting his main aim was to improve the world.

Mr Blair, 61, has been widely attacked for selling his services to some of the world’s most authoritarian leaders, including the ex-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Kazakhstan president Nursulstan Nazarbayev.

After detailing Mr Blair’s work for several questionable world leaders, the author of the profile and interview, Vanity Fair contributing editor Sarah Ellison, wrote: ‘And is there anyone he wouldn’t work for?

‘For instance, would he work for Vladimir Putin if Putin called asking for advice? Blair smiled, and switched the topic to Kazakhstan.’

Later she wrote: ‘He paused and then added, “I’m not holding my breath for the call from Putin.”

‘But if it came, I asked? “It won’t come, so let me not either praise or insult”.’

He insisted the Russian leader was never likely to seek his services.

Mr Blair, who insisted that ‘whatever criticisms people have of me, they’ve seldom thought of me as politically stupid’, said there were no conflicts of interest between his charity role and lucrative work as an international advisor.

But he stressed that he was now a ‘private sector individual’ not a government representative and should not be bound by the same rules.

Quizzed on his most controversial legacy, Mr Blair said the world should listen to him precisely because of his track record in Iraq and Afghanistan.

‘People say, “Why should you listen to him?” – because of Iraq. And I keep saying, that’s why you should listen to me. Because I’ve been through this in government, and since leaving office I’ve been studying it the whole time, he said.

He added: ‘One thing that is quite interesting to me is how poor Western governments are at the moment – and I don’t exempt mine from this – how poor they are at understanding what’s going on in the world.’

His own understanding of the world, he boasted, was ‘just so much more sophisticated and deep than the understanding I had in government’.

Unfortunately for Mr Blair, those who have encountered him in his role as official envoy of the Quartet – the international coalition seeking peace in the Israeli-Palestine conflict - told Vanity Fair they were not impressed.

A prominent Israeli lawyer said he had ‘trivialised’ the Quartet while Mahmoud Labadi, a senior Palestinian leader, dismissed him as ineffectual.

And there was also some withering criticism from his former friend, novelist Robert Harris, who compared Mr Blair’s controversial post-Downing Street years to a Greek tragedy.

Harris described his former friend as a ‘very curious individual’, saying: ‘The truth is whatever he perceives it to be at a given moment. I don’t think he’s ever really…lying. I think he becomes convinced at the moment he’s saying something that it’s true.’
