Prince Charles has long championed organic farming and was more than happy to lend a hand as he continued his tour of India today.

He visited the Navdanya organic farm and education centre in Dehradun, in the north of the country, this afternoon, where he sowed some rice seeds - throwing them as two bullocks ploughed the field beside him.

While Camilla attended a pottery lesson at a nearby school, Charles spent nearly an hour in the company of Dr Vandana Shiva as he toured the site that promotes biodiversity, organic farming and the process of seed saving.

The two are said to inspire each other, with Charles having a bust of the Indian environmental activist at his Highgrove home.

Before leaving the site, he planted a rudraksh, or holy tree, sapling near a dining hall before signing the visitor book.

A dozen or so interns also chatted to the prince before he departed including one from Britain.

Emma Jaquess, 22, who grew up in 
Hammersmith, west London, but now lives in France, spoke to Charles 
about her six-month period of work experience which started in June.

Camilla stamped some material at Doon, a renowned public school, and interacted with staff, students and also children from underprivileged backgrounds

She said: 'He was very interested in what I was doing particularly my garden of knowledge where we grow plants of the region - that isn't food.'

While Charles toured the organic farm, Camilla visited the elite Doon School where she attended a pottery class and a micro-finance class.

Earlier today, the Duchess of Cornwall looked overjoyed when she was treated to a display of precision riding reminiscent at an Indian military academy.

Racing across a field at a gallop, riders used lances, swords and bayonets to spear targets on the ground, to Camilla's delight.

The exhibition of horsemanship was made by trainee officers - known as gentlemen cadets - from the prestigious Indian Military Academy in Dehradun.

The Prince of Wales and Camilla toured the training centre where future officers undergo rigorous schooling to prepare them for life in the forces.

Founded in 1932 it is the equivalent of the UK's Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, with around 1,700 cadets being trained at any one time at the base, set in acres of manicured grounds.

The duchess was impressed by Anant Rajpurohid, 21, who showed off his riding skills in an activity called tent pegging.

He used a lance to spear a foam target, then dropped it to grab a sword stuck in the ground which he used to stab another peg before picking up a bayonet to hit a final target.

At the end of the display Camilla asked him: 'How long did it take you to learn that? You're a natural.'

The
duchess, who wore a knitted poppy on the shoulder of her outfit, also 
saw displays of show jumping and polo, but when she met some of the 
academy's many horses she had a sweet treat in store for them, giving 
the animals large brown lumps of sugar cane as she talked to their 
riders.

The duchess handed out the lumps from a tray carried by one of the military staff.

In another part of the training centre
Charles was shown some of the Indian army's most unusual recruits - 
mules - and latest techniques in warfare.

The
commandant of the academy, Lieutenant General Manvender Singh, told the
prince that mules are still used in hilly areas, where they carry up to
70kg.

An instructor added: 'We have our 
borders with the Himalayas, where there are no roads. The mules carry 
everything - fuel, ammunition, rations - and take it to the furthermost 
outposts.'

Prince Charles shares a light moment with junior Indian army officers

Prince Charles and his wife Camilla visited a military academy on the first full day of their Indian tour which began with garlands and a blessing beside the River Ganges

In a building 
designed to simulate fighting in built-up areas, the prince watched a 
cadet go from room to room firing at moving targets - once with blank 
ammunition as the prince followed behind, and then with live ammunition 
as Charles watched from the safety of the control room.

Inspecting
the troops, he met a number of foreign recruits including some from 
Afghanistan. 'They are very good at boxing,' said the commandant.

Charles
might have revealed something of his own experience of military 
training when he asked some cadets: 'Do you do military history?' he 
asked.
