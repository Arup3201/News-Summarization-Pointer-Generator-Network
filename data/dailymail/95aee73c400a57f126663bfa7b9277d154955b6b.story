Heather Watson scored the best win of her career on Sunday night when she defeated world No 8 Agnieskza Radwanska to make the last sixteen of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.

On the day that Laura Robson was again forced to postpone her comeback, Watson defeated a top ten player for the first time by overcoming the former Wimbledon finalist 6-4, 6-4 in 93 minutes.

Watson, benefiting from her groundstrokes and serve being boosted by the dry air and altitude in the Californian desert, played with the confidence derived from already having beaten two formidable opponents, Germany’s Julia Goerges and Italy’s Camila Giorgi.

Against the crafty Pole, who reached the final last year and had beaten her easily in her three previous meetings, she struck out bravely and was helped by hitting seven aces, often at crucial times. Radwanska seemed to have got back into it when she recovered to 3-2 in the second set, but Watson stopped her revival and held her nerve after breaking for 5-4 at the end .

She was awaiting the winner of Carla Suarez Navarro and Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

Meanwhile he friend and rival Robson has handed back the wildcard she had accepted into the qualifying event for next week’s Miami Open due to continuing concerns over her troublesome left wrist.

The former British number has not played for 14 months now, having last hit a ball in anger at the 2014 Australian Open and undergone surgery on wrist tendons early last summer.

She had initially hoped to play in smaller events in California leading into Indian Wells, but has now had to postpone reappearing again with caution being the watchword.

Robson is not said to have suffered any major setback but wants to be sure the area is strong enough to withstand the rigours of competition. A possible new target is a WTA event in Colombia next month but she has made it clear there will be no rushing back from what is the most infernal injury for tennis players.
