NHS officials in the West Midlands are proposing to pay family doctors £150 an hour – as well as £200 towards staffing costs - to work on Easter Saturday

GPs are in revolt over NHS plans to offer them a ‘paltry’ £650 for opening their surgeries on the morning of Easter Saturday.

Officials in the West Midlands are proposing to pay family doctors £150 an hour – as well as £200 towards staffing costs – to work for three hours that morning.

But a number of GPs have condemned the size of the payments and say they’ll only turn up if the money is 'quadrupled'.

The offer is being made by NHS managers in the West Midlands to avert an expected surge in A&E attendances over the Easter weekend, in early April.

Most GP surgeries will be closed for four days in a row from Good Friday, 3rd April, through to Easter Monday, which is also a bank holiday.

Many patients who fall ill in this time will go to A&E as they are still unaware of how to contact their out-of-hours service or of the NHS 111 helpline.

A&E units are still under intense pressure even though winter is almost over and the numbers of seriously ill patients has declined.

Figures for last week showed that the NHS as a whole failed to meet the target of ensuring that 95 per cent of patients were seen within four hours.

This has not been met since September but health officials are hoping that the situation will finally improve in April, when the weather turns milder and winter illnesses begin to abate.

But they are concerned that a sudden surge in demand when GPs are closed over Easter will cause extra pressures and set hospitals back again.

NHS officials are offering surgeries in the region covering Birmingham, Solihull, Hereford and Worcester £650 to open for three hours.

This includes £150 per hour paid to one GP for three hours and the remaining £200 to pay for receptionists or practice nurses.

Guidance obtained by Pulse magazine  urges practices to sign-up to the arrangement by tomorrow afternoon.

It states: ‘We are keen for practices to offer sessions if possible and have agreed a costing.

‘Please confirm if you wish to participate at earliest convenience to allows us to assess impact and by close of play on Wednesday 11th March at the latest.'

There are 600 practices in two regions being offered the payments which include the Birmingham, Solihull and the Black Country as well as Arden, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.

But a number of GPs took to the Pulse website to express their disgust at the size of the payments.

One wrote: ‘GPs in England work for such paltry sums it’s embarrassing.’

Another said: ‘Now they’ve established the principle of paying, tell em to quadruple it.’

One, a GP partner, a senior doctor in charge of a surgery, said: ‘I do not get out of bed for less than £300 per hour’ – although it was not clear from his tone whether he was joking.

And a practice nurse said: ‘A plumber would get paid more, a solicitor would get that per hour. We are seen of no value.’
