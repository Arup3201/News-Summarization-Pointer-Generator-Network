Cheese: good. Chocolate: good. Cheesy chocolate? You have got to be kidding me.

Well, no. At least, not according to the Great British Chefs, a bunch of cooking experts who have proclaimed chocolate and cheese muddled up together as the next big foodie trend of 2014.

And they're not just talking chocolate cheesecake, chocolate and ricotta puddings or chocolate Philadelphia - essentially a super-creamy Nutella.

They're talking Roquefort and cinnamon chocolate doughnuts, chocolate and Shropshire blue cake, goat's cheese and lemon ganache, and Port and Stilton truffles.

Cheese and chocolate, served together, are set to be the next big thing in food

Masterclass: Paul A Young shared his stilton truffle recipe with foodie Pinterset fans in London

The group have been moved to rave about the pongy pairing since foodie fans on Pinterest have started sharing chocolatier Paul A Young's port and stilton truffle recipe with gusto.

It may initially seem counter-intuitive, but chocolate and cheese have long been considered good plate-fellows by the professionals, and experimental molecular gastronomists including Heston Blumenthal (The Fat Duck) and Ferran Adria (El Bulli) have been celebrating the flavour pairing in dishes for some time.

The discovery that chocolate and blue cheese share multiple flavour compounds led to the creation of Blumenthal's molten chocolate and blue cheese cake.

And while we may wince at the idea of dunking a Snickers in a blue cheese fondue, more and more chefs are trying to bring us round to their way of thinking.

Never be forced to choose between chocolate and cheese ever again when these two start appearing on menus together

Kraft and Cadbury teamed up to make Philadelphia chocolate recently

Mecca Ibrahim at Great British Chefs told MailOnline: 'Heston Blumenthal was one of the first chefs in the UK to develop blue cheese and chocolate as a pairing with his famous Molten chocolate and blue cheese cake. 

'Chocolate and blue cheese share 73 flavour compounds, so there's actually a scientific reason as to why we find the mix appealing.

Paul A Young has been surprising UK chocaholics with chocolate and cheese pairings for a while, particularly his best-loved being Port and Stilton truffles and goat's cheese and lemon ganache.

And French Pascal Aussignac, who runs a number of award-winning restaurants in London, has created a recipe for cinnamon doughnuts filled with a unique blend of white chocolate and Roquefort cheese.

Everyone knows that soft, mild cheeses such as ricotta and cream cheese go well with chocolate... but what about stronger cheeses such as Gorgonzola?

David  Cameron has Niki Segnit's Flavour Thesaurus on his book shelf in Downing Street

Niki Segnit is the author of The Flavour Thesaurus, a food pairing bible that explains which flavours go well together and why.

(Her comprehensive and utterly mouthwatering guide to taste was, incidentally, spotted on the Prime Minister's personal bookshelf just last week.)

In her book Segnit explains that she discovered the pairing of chocolate and cheese at a Paul A Young tasting.

Apprehensive at first, she said the two flavours work because of 'how comparable it is to chocolate and milk (or cream) and, further, 
how the flavour notes in some good chocolate - spicy berry fruits, dried
 fruits, caramels - are natural partners for cheese'.

By June you'll all be sprinkling Parmesan into your chocolate mousse, just you wait.

Port and Stilton truffles

INGREDIENTS

200ml of double cream75g of golden caster sugar100g of Stilton, very mature,roughly chopped500g of 70% dark chocolate,broken into pieces75ml of tawny port200ml of watercocoa powder

METHOD

1. To make the ganache, add the water, cream, sugar and Stilton to a pan and bring to a simmer. Place the chocolate in a large, heat-proof bowl and pour the Stilton mixture into the bowl, stirring continuously to melt the chocolate2. Mix the port into the chocolate until completely incorporated. Allow to cool then cover and place in the fridge for at least 2 hours to set3. Once set, scoop out even quantities with a teaspoon and place on some parchment paper. Coat your hands in cocoa powder and quickly roll into balls before the ganache starts to melt. Store in the fridge until ready to coat in tempered chocolate, or eat straight away.

Goat's cheese and lemon ganache

INGREDIENTS

250g of Cerney goat's cheese, or similar, ash coating removed100g of goat's curd, or full-fat cream cheese2 lemons, juiced and zested200g of golden caster sugar400g of fine white chocolate, broken into pieces40 chocolate shells300g of chocolate, tempered, for capping shells

MEASURE

1. Measure out 150ml of water and add to a pan with the goat's cheese, goat's curd, lemon zest and juice. Bring to a simmer and cook until smooth and combined

2.Add the sugar to the mix and stir to melt, then remove from the heat and whisk in the chocolate. Check the ganache and add a little more sugar if needed. Set aside to cool

3.Once the ganache is tepid, transfer to a piping bag with a nozzle small enough to fit into the hole of your shells. Pipe the ganache into the shells, leaving a 2mm gap before you reach the top so you can seal the chocolate later. Leave to set for at least 6 hours, ideally overnight

4.To cap the shells, dollop a small amount of tempered chocolate over the hole of each chocolate. Use a palette knife to scrape off any excess chocolate and allow to set for 20 minutes

5.Alternatively, once the ganache has cooled, leave in the fridge for 2 hours to set. Once the ganache is set, scoop out even quantities with a teaspoon and place on some parchment paper.

6. Coat your hands in cocoa powder and quickly roll into balls before the ganache starts to melt. Store in the fridge until ready to coat in tempered chocolate, or eat straight away

Roquefort, cinnamon and chocolate doughnut

INGREDIENTS

Doughnut batter95ml of water30g of butter5g of sugar1 pinch of salt60g of plain flour1 egg1l of oilChocolate filling200g of white chocolate200g of Roquefort cheese, crumbledCinnamon sugar75g of caster sugar25g of ground cinnamonCognac jelly150ml of cognac50ml of water2 gelatine leavesTo plate6 cinnamon sticksMETHOD

1. Place the water, butter, sugar and salt into a saucepan. Bring to the boil and add the flour, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon. Cook for 3-5 minutes then remove from the heat and mix in the egg

2. Continue to beat for 2 minutes. Place in the fridge to cool and rest for 1 hour

3. Heat some oil in a fryer or saucepan to 130-140°C. Divide the batter into 50g portions and fry for 10-15 minutes, making sure to turn and baste constantly

4. The doughnuts will almost double in size and will become crisp and golden as they cook

5. Mix the sugar and cinnamon together. Once the doughnuts are cooked roll them in the sugar and set aside

6. Place the chocolate in a bowl over a pan of simmering water or melt in the microwave. Once melted, remove from the heat and add the crumbled Roquefort and stir7. To melt the chocolate break it into pieces, put it in a bowl and rest the bowl on a saucepan of simmering water over a low heat. Make sure that the water doesn't touch the bottom of the bowl

8. Don’t mix too thoroughly; you want a few pieces of the Roquefort to add texture to the mix. Spoon the mix into a piping bag and set aside

9. To soak the gelatine leaves, put in cold water for about four minutes

10. Mix the cognac with the water. Soak the gelatine water, then squeeze out the excess and place in a saucepan with 50ml of the cognac mix. Melt the gelatine over a low heat then whisk into the rest of the cognac mix

11. Pass the liquid through a sieve and put in a container in the fridge until set, which should take around 1 hour

12. To serve, make a small hole in the bottom of each doughnut and pipe in the Roquefort mix

13. Sprinkle some cinnamon sugar around the plate, spoon on some jelly and add the doughnut.

14. Lastly, position the cinnamon sticks across each plate
