Britain will turn ‘very nasty’ if politicians continue to ignore the pressure immigrants put on housing, schools and hospitals, a Labour MP has warned.

Frank Field said there is no plan to address the strain on public services, despite the population increasing by the size of Birmingham every two-and-a-half years.

The former employment minister said this level of immigration must be questioned at a time of deep spending cuts.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Yet there are no plans for increasing housing or places in schools, at a time when we will in the next parliament, have to make cuts greater than the cuts made in this parliament.

‘That is the underlying theme to politics which, if we as politicians continue to ignore what is going on, is obviously going to become very nasty.’

He said it would be ‘foolish’ to claim immigrants make no positive contribution.

But he added: ‘The dispute is actually how big that contribution is because, quite naturally, people who come here to work draw the proceeds of work.

‘What is actually left over in their contribution to the wider community is a lot less, I think, than people maintain.

‘But I don’t think it is a question about that any more.’
