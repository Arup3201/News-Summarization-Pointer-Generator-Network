Parents of preschoolers at a  St Louis school say their kids have been heartbroken after losing one of their favorite teachers.

Kelly Hahn was put on leave from Wilkinson Early Childhood Center last December, just two weeks after being named the St Louis Public School district's 'Pre-K Teacher of the Year.'

Fox2Now reports that children were coming home in tears after learning their favorite teacher was gone, and a rumor spread that Hahn had been diagnosed with cancer.

Leave: Kelly Hahn was put on leave two weeks after being named St Louis Public School district's 'Pre-K Teacher of the Year' over an incident involving a student who came to school in a pull-up diaper

'She is one of those people that I would say is the glue that holds Wilkinson together,' PTO President Dana Evans told KMOV. 

But sadness turned to anger after parents learned that Hahn had received a letter saying she'd been dismissed for child neglect and endangerment, which parents say stemmed from an incident over a diaper. 

A three-year-old had come to school one day in a pull-up diaper, which is against the rules at Wilkinson. 

After Hahn discovered the diaper, she let the child keep it on instead of removing it, and simply notified the parents.

Another teacher notified Missouri Department of Family Services, which conducted an investigation that found no signs of neglect.

St Louis Public Schools Superintendent Kelvin Adams says that the district has separate standards of conduct, though he did not comment specifically on Hahn.

'That’s the handcuffs that we have relating to personnel, we cannot discuss specific personnel issues,' Adams told Fox2Now. 

Even the parent of the child who came to school in a diaper says the punishment wasn't deserved.

'Regardless of the policy, what happened is so minor that it couldn’t possibly warrant incriminating a fabulous teacher,' said Cynthia West.

Now, parents say, their children are under the supervision of a substitute who isn't certified. They've send more than 100 emails trying to get Hahn reinstated.

'I just want what`s best for her, what’s best for my kids,' said parent Sue Gilmor. 'And what’s best for him is having his teacher back. She loves those kids, and there’s no substitute for that.'
