Failure: BBC Worldwide's purchase of the Lonely Planet has ended in a 'significant financial loss' the vice chairman of the BBC Trust has admitted

When the BBC bought travel guide brand Lonely Planet, it was seen as a controversial move.

And the purchase proved a financial failure yesterday when the corporation admitted it was selling the firm for £80million less than it paid for it.

The huge loss has prompted the corporation's governing body, the BBC Trust, to order a review into how this could have happened.

US-based NC2 Media is set to buy Lonely Planet, the biggest-selling brand in the UK travel guide market, from BBC Worldwide for £51.5million.

This marks a 60 per cent reduction on the £130.2million the BBC shelled out in acquiring the firm – paid in two chunks in 2007 and 2011.

The corporation was accused of venturing beyond its natural territory when it originally bought Lonely Planet from co-founders Maureen and Tony Wheeler.

Until then BBC Worldwide had mainly been involved in selling formats and shows abroad, rather than buying up other firms.

Diane Coyle, vice chairman of the BBC Trust, said yesterday that the deal was a 'significant financial loss', adding: 'The Trust's strategy for Worldwide now is to focus on BBC programme content, and Worldwide would not make this sort of acquisition again.'

Paul Dempsey, interim chief executive of BBC Worldwide, said: 'We acquired Lonely Planet in 2007 when both our strategy and the market conditions were quite different.'

He added that the travel guide brand 'no longer fits' with BBC plans.
