TOWIE's Sam Faiers and Maria Fowler also on red carpet in daring frocks 

She's had enough practice as her years as a model on the catwalk - and it seems that Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is turning her movie red carpet outings into something of an art form.

The ravishing Victoria's Secret model, 24, had the crowds gasping at the London screening of her debut film Transformers 3: Dark Of The Moon last night when she turned up in a risqué midnight blue gown.

The backless satin dress, custom-made for her by Burberry, was slashed almost to her navel with only modest drapes of material over her breasts to keep her decent.

Feeling blue: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley looked stunning in a sapphire blue gown that just about kept her decent at the London screening of her new movie Transformers 3: Dark Of The Moon at the IMAX cinema

Sapphire and steel: The model looked icily cool in her stunning frock on the blue carpet

Keeping it together: Rosie had some toupé tape to keep herself decent as she posed with the movie's director Michael Bay

Yet the star, who had her hair in a chic up-do, managed to look classy at the same time - quite a feat. 

It appears that some judiciously-placed toupé tape on her top half was most definitely keeping the star from revealing more of her curves than she intended.

She had looked equally incredible in a sparkling silver gown for the German premiere of her first ever movie in Berlin. 

Back to the future: Rosie, who looked sensational in the sapphire gown, is hoping to do more acting as well as continue with her modelling  

She's been pushing out all the stops to get maximum coverage for her role in the movie, which she wrested from Megan Fox, by wearing a series of show-stopping outfits over the past few weeks while promoting to film around the globe. 

She was joined on the scarlet carpet at the IMAX cinema in London's Waterloo by a host of the cast of The Only Way Is Essex.

Red headed glamour model Maria Fowler tried to give Rosie a run for her money in a strappy black and silver floorlength dress with thigh slashes, but pretty as she is, it was no contest.

Quick-change: Rise swapped her blue gown for a chic Burberry dress and heels for the after party at Morton Members Club

Bit of leg: The model-turned actress flashed her long legs in the back of the car

TOWIE in London: Sam Faiers was wearing a plunging figure-hugging scarlet dress, Maria Fowler in a strappy black and silver number with slashes at the thighs, and Jessica Wright in a white palazzo pant suit

Date night: Sam was accompanied by her boyfriend, TOWIE co-star Joey Essex, and Calum Best had taken his girlfriend Georgia Salpa

Film fans: Former A1 star Ben Adams with his girlfriend and Golden Compass star Dakota Blue Richards (R)

She was joined by her TOWIE co-star Sam Faiers who was wearing a revealing capsleeved scarlet that revealed her impressive cleavage, and Jessica Wright in a white palazzo pant suit.

Sam was squired by her equally 'reem' boyfriend Joey Essex, who had ditched the skinny jeans for once and looked smart in slacks, open-necked shirt and tan loafers. 

Other stars at the premiere tonight including chat show host Jeremy Kyle, Golden Compass star Dakota Blue Richards, fashion desinger Christopher Kane, and reality TV stars Calum Best and girlfriend Georgia Salpa.

Calum and Georgia met on the set of Irish reality show Celebrity Salon earlier this year. Transformers 3: Dark Of The Moon meanwhile opens in the UK on 29 June.

Breathtaking: The star wore a sparkling silver backless gown to the German premiere of the movie in Berlin
