Ternic Aciro, 12, was sent home from her school in Dagenham in Essex for failing to pay £1 for non-uniform day

A 12-year-old girl was sent home from school on a non-uniform day because she had forgotten to pay a £1 donation online the night before.

Ternic Aciro arrived at school in Essex where she was told she would either have to spend the entire day in isolation or go home. 

Brenda Aciro, mother to Ternic, accused the school of bullying her child by putting her at risk of taunts from other children simply because she had forgotten to pay using the cashless online ParentPay system.

Sydney Russell School in Dagenham has defended its actions saying the event had been advertised for weeks before and the school's policy on pupils having to work separately or being sent home was clear. 

Ms Aciro, a nail technician and beauty therapist, said: 'To be told to go into isolation or be sent home because I didn't pay £1 is ridiculous.

'I just completely forgot to pay it.

'It's totally wrong because how can you punish my child in front of her class?

'That is a form of discrimination, of bullying, really.' 

Most schools hold non-uniform, or mufti, days to raise money for local, national or international charities. 

But Ms Aciro said the action by the school could put her child at risk of bullying. 

She added: 'This just gives kids ammunition to bully Ternic and she is really upset.

'They then sent her home without getting directly through to me - my child could have been roaming the streets without me even knowing.'

However Sydney Russell School, which has around 1,600 students between the ages of 11 and 18, said it believed the school had acted justly. 

Brenda Aciro (right) said the school had discriminated against her daughter after she forgot to pay the £1 fee 

Sydney Russel School, a secondary school, has defended its actions saying its policy is fair to all pupils 

A spokesman said: 'If a child arrives in school on a non-uniform day without school uniform but without having paid their pound, parents are phoned and given the choice of their child staying in school but working apart from other pupils or going home to change.

'We followed our protocols and phoned the parent to discuss what had happened but failed to make contact so called the second named contact supplied to us by the parent.

'The second contact agreed it was okay to send the child home to get changed.

'The rules are fair and we will always try our best to work closely with parents and pupils.'
