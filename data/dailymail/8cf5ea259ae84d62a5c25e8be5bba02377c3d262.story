A Chinese kindergarten teacher has been caught kicking and beating students in security camera footage.

The teacher, known as Ms Liu, 27, was arrested on Monday afternoon in Beijing and a special team has been formed by the local education authority to investigate the matter.

In the recording, the woman is seen attacking several students after they refused to conform to her strict regime.

Caught on camera: A kindergarten teacher in Beijing was filmed 'kicking and beating' a young student

Kindergarten scandal: The beating is one of many recent assults by teachers in China

Horrific scene: The student is seen lying on the ground as the teacher stands above them

After parents approached school administrators with doctors’ notes and pictures of their children’s injuries, the Beijing school released the vision.

Upon seeing the video, the South China Morning Post reports that Ms Liu screamed in shock, and said: ‘I can’t believe I did this!’

One father, identified as Mr Ma, said he discovered bruises on his son’s leg as he was bathing him one evening.

‘Since last October, I saw bruises on my son’s legs constantly. My son has woken up crying several times at night, screaming, don’t hit me.’

Teacher's orders: The teacher was heard asking all the students to stand in a corner

This incident follows a spate of teacher abuse cases across China.

In October 2012, images emerged of a teacher holding a primary school student by the ears.

In July 2013, video emerged of a teacher dragging a terrified female pupil out of the classroom, kicking her to the floor and then pushing her up against a wall.

Most shocking, however, were reports that emerged in November 2013 of a ten-year-old boy committing suicide by jumping from a 30th floor window after his teacher told him to jump out of the building when he failed to complete an assigned task.

Accusations: The teacher has been accused of beating the students on the head, calves and back
