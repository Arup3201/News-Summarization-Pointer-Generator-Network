Robert Kennedy Jr's true feelings on a number of top New York Democrats have been revealed as more excerpts from his stolen diary were published.

The son of the slain former Attorney General wrote that Reverends Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton 'give me the creeps' and that their obvious agendas did a disservice to their political goals.

The revelations come on top of his admissions about 'lust demons' that drove him to cheat on his wife Mary, who killed herself last year just days after he filed for divorce.

The second batch of excerpts come from The New York Post, and Kennedy put out a statement condemning their publication but confirming that they did in fact come from him.

A 2001 diary belonging to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , pictured with late wife Mary, has been unearthed that gives a stunning insight into the number of affairs he carried out during the same year that she gave birth to their fourth child

Activism: The journal dates back to 2001, when Robert was arrested and spent a month in jail in Vieques, Puerto Rico (pictured here in August of that year)

'Creepy': RFK Jr was in jail with Rev. Al Sharpton (left) and the wife of Rev. Jesse Jackson (right), and he wrote disparagingly about the two black civil rights leaders

'The New York Post has chosen to print 
excerpts from a 13-year-old diary illegally stolen from me,' he said in a
statement to the paper.

'The diary served as a tool for self-examination and for dealing with my spiritual struggles at the time. It also contains unedited, unfiltered stream-of-consciousness musings about current events and people.’

Those newsworthy people included a number of politicians from his own party- and even his own family.

At the time that the diary was written, Kennedy's sister Kerry was married to Andrew Cuomo when he was the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Focused on their image: Reverends Jesse Jackson (left) and Al Sharpton (right) were subjects of withering criticism from Kennedy as he said that they were in it for themselves

Try try again: Int he journal, Kennedy said his then-brother-in-law Andrew Cuomo would have a problem winning the 2002 election (which he lost) because he 'lacked humanity'

Family: At the time the journal was written, Robert's sister Kerry (left, see in 1990) was married to Andrew Cuomo (right), who was then worked in the Department of Housing and Urban Development but was mulling a gubernatorial run

When Andrew came to his then-brother-in-law for advice about a possible gubernatorial run- hoping to follow in his father Mario's footsteps.

In the journal, Robert wrote that Cuomo could win due to his energy and focus, but 'he could lose because he lacks humanity and doesn't love people'.

Ends up that Robert was right at the time since Cuomo's 2002 bid for governor failed but he went on to win in 2010.

That wasn't the only entry where 
Kennedy weighed in on the Cuomo family's legal skills, as then-retired 
Governor Mario helped try to get Kennedy out of a jail sentence after he
and several other activists were arrested during a demonstration in 
Vieques, Puerto Rico.

Kennedy was jailed alongside Reverend Al Sharpton and the wife of Jesse Jackson.

During
lock up, he apparently had plenty of time to critique his fellow 
Democrats, saying that Sharpton 'has done more damage to the black 
cause' than segregationist governors in the south who prevented school 
integration.

'(Sharpton's) transparent venal blackmail and extortion schemes taint all black leadership,' Kennedy wrote.

Kennedy spent 30 days in a Puerto Rican jail alongside Rev. Al Sharpton in July 2001 after getting arrested for trespassing at a U.S. Navy training facility.

Kennedy, pictured at his wife Mary's graveside last year with their children, writes in his diary about his feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on her

Jackson wasn't spared sharp criticism either, as Kennedy wrote that he had 'a desperate and destructive addiction to publicity'.

'I feel dirty around him, and I feel like I’m being used. I feel like with Jesse, it’s all about Jesse,' he added.

The timing of the journal means that it included the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. As a result, he included some withering reviews of the Republican response.

He wrote that President George Bush was 'an idiot and a puppet' and New York City's then-mayor Rudy Giuliani was a 'little despot' who was 'desperate' to hold on to his position of power.

Kennedy wrote that he had his own 
power control issues, as he made startling admissions of his own 
feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on his wife.

‘I’m
like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. 
But the fruit is all I want,’ he wrote on November  5, 2001.

On days when he doesn’t cheat, Kennedy writes ‘victory’ to signify that he resisted sexual temptation.

He
even used a section at the back of his diary, headed ‘cash accounts,’ 
to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a 
mark out of ten.

The list 
contains the names of 37 women, 16 of whom have the number ten beside 
them - which is believed to have signified that they had full 
intercourse.
