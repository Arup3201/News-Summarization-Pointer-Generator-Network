Islamic State have released photos from one of their forthcoming videos showing the execution of eight Iraqi police officers, who are accused of informing on Islamic State for the Iraqi government.

Entitled 'the Day of Judgement', the photos show eight Iraqi men dressed in orange Guantanamo Bay style jumpsuits. 

Standing behind them are Islamic State's notorious security forces, known for carrying out mass public executions in broad daylight.

Final moments: ISIS has released still images from a forthcoming video which allegedly shows the execution of eight Iraqi police officers

Several of the victims are named in the captions and appear to have been interviewed for the video as they are seen wearing microphones.

The leader of the group is named as Captain Hossam Salah Bnosh. According to Islamic State media, Bnosh and seven other police officers converted to Sunni Islam and joined Islamic State.

However once they had infiltrated the Islamic State security forces, they began to secretly spy for the Iraqi government.

The group are accused of providing intelligence information to the Iraqi government, identifying targets for coalition airstrikes against Islamic State.

Ahmad Basil Ramadan, a young bearded Iraqi, was accused of giving information on the location of Islamic State soldier houses. 

The victims, accused of spying on ISIS appear to have been interviewed before their executions

Another prisoner wearing a microphone is named as Marwan Habib Said, who reportedly joined Islamic State security forces but was caught giving target information to the Iraqi government.

The photos show how the eight prisoners were blindfolded and frogmarched along the edge of the river, most likely the Euphrates.

Their hands are handcuffed behind their backs and each Islamic State fighter appears to be holding their victim's neck as they march to their deaths.

They appear to have been taken to a quiet area away from the city, possibly under a motorway bridge, near the river. Forced to kneel down and unable to see, the prisoners wait as each Islamic State fighter draws their pistol and takes aim.

Each prisoner is executed with a single bullet to the head. Afterwards, the security forces pose for a photo. The squadron are shown pointing their pistols at the video camera.

Rule of terror: Islamic State's notorious security forces are known for carrying out mass public executions

The executions come just weeks after photos emerged on social media of another public execution in Salahuddin province. The photos show 13 Islamic State security forces standing in a line, with a prisoner kneeling in front of them.

The mass execution appears to have taken place at a roundabout or square believed to be in the Iraqi city of Mosul.

Each prisoner is wearing an orange uniform, similar to the tunics worn by the three western journalists and two aidworkers, who were executed in recent months. Their hands are hands are tied behind their backs.

In broad daylight, all of the prisoners are then executed by a single pistol round to the head. Their bodies lie slumped in the curb whilst the barbaric executioners are seen triumphantly holding their pistols up in the air at their achievement.

The large black flags of Islamic State can be seen fluttering in the background.

It is believed the thirteen prisoners were captured from when Islamic State briefly captured the strategic oilfield at Baiji. They were all found guilty of treachery and apostacy according to an Islamic State court.
