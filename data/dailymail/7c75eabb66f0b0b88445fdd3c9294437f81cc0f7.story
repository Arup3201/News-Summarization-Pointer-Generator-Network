The girlfriend of infamous mobster James ‘Whitey’ Bulger will plead guilty to helping him evade capture for 16 years, according to reports.

As part of a plea deal, Catherine Greig, 60, will plead guilty to conspiracy to harbour a fugitive as well as identity theft.

The families of Bulger’s alleged victims say Greig also refuses to testify against her long-time boyfriend and will not cooperate with federal prosecutors.

Boston-based U.S. attorney Carmen Oritz warned victim’s families that because she has no prior convictions, Greig could be behind bars for as few as 32 months, the Boston Herald reported.

Both crimes carry a maximum prison sentence of five years each.

Prosecutors said last fall they were considering filing additional charges against her. She has a pre-trial hearing scheduled for Wednesday, and her trial is scheduled for May 7.

Bulger’s trial is scheduled for November 5.

Greig, a former dental hygienist, and Bulger were on the run for 16 years, often hiding in plain sight by assuming false identities.

They were captured in California on June 22 of last year, living modest middle-class lives in a $3,000 per month Santa Monica apartment complex.

Bulger, now 82 and said to be suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, has pleaded not guilty in connection with 19 killings.

He headed Boston's infamous Winter Hill Gang and was an FBI informant against the rival New England Mafia and was on the FBI's most-wanted list for over a decade.

Often, he was second only to Osama bin Laden, and had a $1million bounty on his head.

His's former FBI handler, John Connolly Jr., was convicted of racketeering for warning Bulger that he was about to be indicted just before Bulger fled Boston in late 1994.

After he was arrested, agents found 
$822,198 in cash in his apartment, much of it in packages containing 
$100 bills that were hidden inside a wall, prosecutors said, money which
is now frozen.

In their memo, prosecutors say that during his 16 years on the run, Bulger 'financed a relatively comfortable lifestyle' for himself and Greig.
