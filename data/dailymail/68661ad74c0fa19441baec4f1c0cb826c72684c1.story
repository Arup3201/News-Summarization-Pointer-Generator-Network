Cigarette packets that feature health warnings deter a third of British teenagers from smoking, a survey has revealed.

The
British Heart Foundation’s poll of 2,500 13 to 18-year-olds showed that current packaging on cigarette packets stops 33 per cent of teens from taking up the habit.

The survey also revealed that nearly 8 in 10 young people, or 77 per cent, think the UK should introduce standardised cigarette packs - like those used in Australia.

Deterrent: Health warnings on cigarette packets stop a third of teens from smoking, a new poll has revealed

Australia became the first country in the world to adopt standardised 
cigarette packs - which are almost entirely covered in graphic warnings - last year.

Half of teens in the country said that cigarette packaging stopped them from smoking, the global survey revealed. Two thirds, or 66 per cent, of Australian teens think the packs should be introduced elsewhere in the world.

About 10 per cent of teenagers in the UK assume that certain cigarette brands are healthier than others, the survey also found.

The results come just 24 hours before the European Parliament is set to vote on key legislation that would see cigarette packs across the EU feature larger graphic health warnings on both sides of the box.

Later this month, the House of Lords will debate a cross-party amendment to the Children and Families 
Bill, which could see standardised packaging become a reality in the UK.

Under the reform, cigarette packs will be a generic size which, 
research shows, makes warnings about the harmful effects of cigarettes 
stand out more.

Simon Gillespie, Chief Executive at 
the British Heart Foundation, said: 'The message from our young people 
is loud and clear: current health warnings aren’t up to the job and the 
UK Government must step up to the mark and introduce standardised packs.

'Smoking kills 100,000 people in the UK every year and we simply can’t wait any longer for legislation.

'Australia has led the way on standardised packs, the Scottish Government has committed, and now the rest of the UK must act to protect future generations from a deadly habit.'

'The evidence shows that standardised packs increase the effectiveness of health warnings and lessen the appeal of cigarettes, particularly among young people, so it’s imperative MEPs vote for larger health warnings and then peers agree to amend the Children and Families Bill.'
