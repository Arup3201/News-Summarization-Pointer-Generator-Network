A man underwent surgery to have 50 maggots removed from his nose before they destroyed his face and killed him.

The painstaking operation to remove the creatures - which had buried deep inside his sinuses - took two hours, doctors said.

The man was suffering from nasal myasis – where the nose and sinuses become infested with the larvae of flies.

A man had surgery to remove 50 maggots from his nasal cavities. He was suffering from nasal myasis, where flies lay their eggs in or around a nose and then hatch into maggots which feed off human flesh

A surgeon removed the writhing maggots one by one. If left untreated, they could chew through the flesh and bones of the face and eyes, possibly causing an infection such as meningitis and even death

Flies lay their eggs in or around a person’s nose, and they hatch into maggots.

The maggots, which are around a centimetre in length, feed off human flesh.

If left untreated, they can chew and destroy the bones and soft tissues of the face, nose and eyes.

This can lead to infection in the eyes and brain, and occasionally causing meningitis and even death.

Dr Meenesh Juvekar, who carried out the operation was able to see into the man's nose using an endoscope.

This is a thin, flexible tube that has a light and a camera on the end.

He uploaded the video from the endoscope’s camera to Youtube afterwards, showing the inside of the man’s nose before and after the procedure.

It shows the white maggots packed into the nasal cavity, sometimes burrowing deep into the nasal tissue.

As they had burrowed so deep, the procedure took two hours to remove them all.

The maggots were buried deep into the man's nasal cavities and sinuses. When the light shined on them they burrowed deeper from view

At the end of the video, a metal bowl is seen filled with the squirming maggots amid pieces of bloody nasal tissue.

Dr Juvekar said he has seen only six to eight cases of nasal maggots in 15 years of his Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) practice.

He added that the man completely recovered from the disease afterwards. 

Nasal myasis is common in tropical countries such as India.

It usually occurs in people who have poor hygiene and nutrition, or alcoholics.

It also occurs in people who have a disease of the nose called Atrophic Rhinitis, which produces foul smelling discharge which attracts the flies.

Around 50 maggots were collected in a metal bowl at the end of the procedure. They were mixed up with bloody pieces of nasal tissue

People with the condition may not be aware they have maggots in the nose, but they will usually experience irritation, sneezing, tears and a headache.

Thin blood-stained discharge often oozes from the nostrils and the eyelids and lips become puffy.

Usually the maggots are killed using chloroform water and oil, and warm saline water is used to flush out the dead maggots.

Surgery to remove the creatures is performed in extreme cases.

Doctors advise that a patient with maggots should covered with a mosquito net to avoid contact with flies, which could lead to further infestation. 

Parents in Rhode Island in the U.S. are being warned that their children could succumb to horrifying infestations of nasal maggots worming in their noses if they continue snorting Smarties sweets. 

The unusual trend  seeks to imitate cocaine users seen on television.

But doctors are warning the bizarre trend can lead to a condition called nasal myiasis - which occurs when flies lay larvae eggs inside the nose.

They are attracted by the rotting debris of the sweets stick inside the nasal lining.

According to officials in Portsmouth Middle School, Rhode Island, the trend is a 'widespread phenomenon' that has been sweeping Youtube in recent years and has involved over a dozen students in the area.

Parents have been warned to watch their children to see if they develop a tickling sensation inside their noses and ask them if they begin to smell a foul stench from inside their nasal passage.
