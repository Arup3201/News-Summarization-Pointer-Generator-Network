A storm that brought some of the highest rainfall totals to the Los Angeles area in years, including eight inches on some mountains, was just the beginning of what the region needs to pull out of a major drought.

Although the storm was expected to remain strong Saturday, forecasters said such systems would have to become common for the state to make serious inroads against the drought.

'We need several large storms and we just don't see that on the horizon,' National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Boldt said Friday. 'This is a rogue storm. We will dry out next week.'

But the storm had yet to do serious damage either. At least not yet.

In
 Azusa and neighboring foothill communities about 25 miles east of Los 
Angeles that sit beneath nearly 2,000 acres of steep mountain slopes 
that just weeks ago were menaced by a wildfire, about 1,200 homes were 
under evacuation orders over mudflow fears but were so-far spared.

In
 particular danger were about a dozen homes in Azusa that were backed up
 against a steep fire-denuded hillside several hundred feet high that 
authorities feared could collapse.

Muddy
 water swept down the hillside earlier in the day, spreading about two 
feet of ooze above one backyard, although fencing walls and an orchard 
of about 5,000 avocado trees behind the development stopped most serious
 debris.

Despite the urging 
of police and fire officials who cleared reporters and others out of the
 neighborhood as the hill grew more saturated, at least a few residents 
decided to stay on.

Dennis 
Sanderson, 50, said his reaction to the evacuation order was 'we'll ride
 it out,' but by nightfall he was undecided and keeping an eye on the 
weather because of forecasts for more rainfall.

Only
 a half-inch of rain was expected late Friday night 'but that doesn't 
mean that mountain won't come down, so we'll probably go ahead and 
leave,' Sanderson said.

Ed 
Heinlein, 65, evacuated early Friday with five other family members 
including his 5-week-old grandson to stay with friends, but kept 
returning to eye the house and the mountain, where mud filled furrows 
more than three feet deep and brimmed over retaining walls three feet 
tall.

'It's your home and 
your life, so it's hard to stay away' Heinlein said. However, 'We're not
 to go back until the threat clears.'

About 13 homes were evacuated Friday night in Palmdale in northern Los Angeles County, where a mudslide closed a major road.

Thunder
 echoed and hard rain fell late Friday night on Hollywood, which was 
abuzz with preparations for Sunday evening's Academy Awards and hopes 
the rain will have moved on by then as expected.

Rainfall
 totals in parts of California were impressive, especially in areas that
 typically don't receive much, but not nearly enough to offer long-term 
relief from a long-running drought.

Three
 inches fell on Bel Air and Pasadena, and an urban flash-flood warning 
that was sent to cell phones was called late Friday night for central 
Los Angeles County.

For the 
first time in nearly three years, downtown Los Angeles received more 
than 2 inches - doubling its total for the rainy season that began in 
July, the National Weather Service said. Yet the city remained 7 inches 
below the normal 11 inches.

Meanwhile
 to the east in San Bernardino County, a levee failed and put eight

 to protect them and no evacuations were ordered.

Forecasters
 expected the storm to last through Saturday in California before 
trundling east into similarly rain-starved neighboring states.

Phoenix
 was expecting its first noticeable precipitation in two months. The 
storm was projected to head east across the Rockies before petering out 
in the Northeast in several days.

Rain also fell along the central coast, the San Francisco Bay area and Central Valley.

Winter
 storm warnings were in effect in the Sierra Nevada. About 15 inches of 
new snow had fallen by mid-day Friday at the University of California, 
Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Lab located at 6,900 feet elevation.

 including one about 60 miles east of Los Angeles involving a big rig 
whose driver died after falling from a freeway overpass.

Power outages hit about 32,000 customers, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Southern California Edison said.

The storm was good news for other Californians who didn't have to worry about mudslides.

put them in the memory bank,' he said.
