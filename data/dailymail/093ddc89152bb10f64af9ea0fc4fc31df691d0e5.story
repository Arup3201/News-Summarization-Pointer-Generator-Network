He claimed to have problems with his balance – and yet Ronald Morgan was repeatedly seen clambering over high roofs and checking out chimneys and guttering.

The benefits cheat was nicknamed the ‘fiddler on the roof’ after he was caught working on houses while claiming disability allowance.

In one case he was filmed 30ft up on a property by benefits investigators. He even advertised his services on the internet, saying he specialised in tiling, slating and re-roofing.

High life: Morgan pocketed thousands in state handouts because he had problems with his balance

But a court heard Morgan was pocketing thousands of pounds in state handouts – while earning his roofing money.

Prosecutor Gerald Neave said: ‘He was
filmed on a variety of roofing jobs following an anonymous call to the 
Department of Work and Pensions’ fraud hotline. He was later interviewed
by their officers and he admitted he was the man in the video.

Cheat: The 64-year-old was fined £330 by magistrates

‘He said he had begun claiming the 
benefit in 2002 when he started to have problems with his balance. But 
he began to feel better, and between March 23, 2011 and October 9, 2012,
was taking on jobs.’

Magistrates at Llanelli, West Wales, 
heard Morgan failed to declare the change and was overpaid £4,227.65 in 
benefits. The covertly filmed video footage shows Morgan on top of 
houses, scrambling around the eaves and checking out their chimneys.

Morgan of Pembrey, Llanelli,  
admitted failing to inform the  Department for Work and Pensions that 
his mobility and care needs had decreased. David Elvy, defending, said: 
‘My client’s condition could change on a daily basis, and he was unsure 
as to whether his return to work would be successful.

It was for this reason he decided not
to contact the Department for Work and Pensions.’ The court heard 
Morgan has already paid back the money he had  dishonestly claimed. He 
was fined £330, ordered to pay £85 costs  and a £33 victim surcharge. 

Convictions for benefit fraud have 
soared by 40 per cent in just two years, according to government 
figures. In 2011-12, 9,861 benefit cheats were convicted compared with 
7,040 in 2009-2010.
