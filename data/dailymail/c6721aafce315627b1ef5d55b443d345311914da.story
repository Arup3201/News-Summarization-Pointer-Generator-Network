Arsene Wenger's treatment of the maligned Gervinho means the striker now 'hates' the club. 

In an astonishing rant squared chiefly at the Gunners' manager, the Ivorian takes aim at the way in which he was put out to pasture while at the Emirates. 

Gervinho spent two frustrating years in north London and was banished to Roma at the beginning of last season. 

Arsene Wenger's treatment of the maligned Gervinho means the striker now 'hates' the club

Gervinho spent two largely unhappy years at Arsenal, scoring just nine Premier League goals 

And while the 27-year-old regrets leaving the club, he had a few choice words to say about Wenger. 

'He [Wenger] never had confidence in me,' Gervinho told Gazzetta dello Sport. 'As a child I dreamed of playing for Arsenal, because I loved them.

'Now I hate them for the way Wenger treated me.

'However, I regretted leaving the club after such a short time without being able to show my worth, which I'm now doing at Roma instead.'
