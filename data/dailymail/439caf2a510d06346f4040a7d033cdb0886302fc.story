Police have unveiled a laser speed camera that is so accurate it can 
tell if drivers are using a mobile phone or not wearing a seatbelt from 
nearly half a mile away.

Officers say it will help in their zero-tolerance approach to motoring offences.

But critics say Dorset police are using the equipment to 'maximise the number of offences' simply to raise funds.

The camera has a traditional laser scanner, like normal speed guns, but also has an HD camera controlled via a 6.4-inch touchscreen

The £12,500 Concept
II is fitted with laser speed-detection equipment and a powerful camera
that can capture motorists in the 'act' of using a mobile phone while 
driving or not wearing a seat belt.

The resolution is 
sharp enough to pick out an unbuckled belt at ranges of up to 600 
metres, records image and video evidence to DVD.

The rural force has launched a zero-tolerance campaign
against motoring offences such as using mobile phones while driving, after incidents including a man playing a harmonica at the wheel of his car.

Project manager Brian Austin said: 'Bizarrely, officers at one of the sites in Dorchester were stunned to see a driver pass them while playing a harmonica using both hands.

'He claimed that he thought he was driving while playing the harmonica quite successfully.'

Officers will be able to use the pictures as evidence to secure a conviction.

Dorset police have 
bought two of them at a cosdt of £25,000 which will be used from current
speed camera vans. The police say that they aim to use the cameras at 
ranges of around 400 metres.

A single Concept II laser speed camera can store hours of hi-def video - enough for details of almost 4,000 separate offences.

Project manager

Dorchester were stunned to see a driver pass them while playing a 
harmonica using both hands.

'He claimed that he thought he was driving while playing the harmonica quite successfully.'

Ian Belchamber, of the anti-speed camera campaign group Dorset Speed, claimed the new cameras were another tool for making the Dorset Road Safe more money.

He said: 'Dorset Road Safe is are under a lot of pressure to keep the money rolling in.

'Dorset’s driver 
awareness courses for offending drivers is the most expensive in the 
country so there is a huge incentive to maximise the number of offences.

'It doesn’t 
surprise me at all that they will look to new methods and the latest 
technology available in order to reach that goal.'

Traffic officers 
are now testing out the Concept II cameras in the back of their safety 
camera vans but are not yet using the video evidence.

A spokesman for the 
Dorset Road Safe said the Concept II cameras will help boost detection 
rates among motorists who think they are above the law.
