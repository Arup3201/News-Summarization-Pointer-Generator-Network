A spate of unusual weather which has seen snow, sun and thunderstorms hit within days of each other has been put down to the jet stream 'wobbling like a drunk driver'.

The jet stream, a river of air high above Earth 
that generally dictates the weather, usually rushes rapidly from west to
east in a mostly straight direction.

But lately it seems to have been knocked off course, wreaking havoc across America as it goes.

The jet stream's odd meanderings kicked off in May with upside-down weather, including early California wildfires fueled by heat.

Meanwhile, in Stillwater, Minnesota, neighbourhoods were covered in almost a foot of snow after an early May snowfall.

People swim and sunbathe at Goose Lake in Anchorage, Alaska. Alaska's largest city and other parts of the state are experiencing a long stretch of higher than normal temperatures thanks to the jet stream 'wreaking havoc' across the U.S.

Seattle was the hottest spot in the nation one day, and Maine and Edmonton, Canada were warmer than Miami and Phoenix.

Jet streams are belts of fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the
atmosphere, formed near air masses with significantly different 
temperatures.

They are responsible for moving weather around the latitudes.

The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia.

The southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round.

One of the main factors in unsettled weather is a change in the position of the jet stream, which can cause massive changes in weather conditions across the globe.

The meandering jet stream path has been attributed to arctic ice loss.

The warming of the Arctic affects the jet 
stream by slowing its west-to-east winds and by promoting larger 
north-south meanders in the flow.

The most recent example is mid-June where some towns in Alaska hit record highs.

The Polar jet stream, which is the 
most northerly jet stream, affects the UK, and tends to be further south
in the winter and further north in the summer.

Recently, the jet stream has been further south - which is why the UK has experienced such wet summers.

In America the meandering jet stream path has been attributed to arctic ice loss.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) explained: 'Enhanced warming of the Arctic affects the jet stream by slowing its west-to-east winds and by promoting larger north-south meanders in the flow.

'Predicting those meanders and where the weather associated with them will be located in any given year, however, remains a challenge.'

They researchers claim that there will be more extreme weather events, such as heavy snowfall, heat waves, and flooding in North America and Europe but these will vary in location, intensity, and timescales.
