Tuscany somehow always sounds expensive, but Garfagnana, a lesser-known area in the north, offers value for investors and second-home owners.

It has dramatic topography, quite different to southern Tuscany, tucked as it is between the Apuan Alps and the Apennines.

It is ideal for outdoor pursuits, and like the rest of the region is famous for its food and wine — in particular chestnuts. Chestnut trees abound among the oaks and pines. 

Value for money: Homes in need of renovation are available for less in Garfagnana

If you enjoy renovating homes, there is an abundance of property in need of modernisation.

Alfa Immobiliare, with an office in Lucca, has a number of ‘wrecks’ on its books, including a small estate at Fosciandora, near the medieval walled town of Castelnuovo di Garfagnana. This comes with around seven hectares with chestnut and oak trees, a small vineyard and stone farmhouse, two barns and a shed, all aching for more than a spruce up.

It is on the market for £329,000, but something of this size would cost almost double in Chiantishire.

‘Prices have dropped over the past couple of years, some properties by 10-15 per cent and there is still room for negotiation on the asking price. It’s a very good time to buy,’ according to Alfa Immobiliare’s Marco Haney, a Scot with Italian heritage who moved to the area  ten years ago.

‘Abandoned villages and hamlets are also coming onto the market, often being sold by people who no longer have the money to fulfil their dream.’ One project well under way, is Selva Piana. This four-and-a-half hectare estate sits near the hamlet of Fiattone, five minutes from the town of Gallicano.

The developers, Dennis and Jane Cardosi, who live partly in Essex, partly in Italy, have converted the original farmhouse and are building eight new detached villas, four semi-detached villas and ten apartments with a communal pool.

Cheaper alternative: The entrance to the old town of Castelnuovo di Garfagnana where there is an abundance of property in need of modernisation

These are high specification with marble or granite kitchen worktops, bespoke chestnut doors and window frames. The rooms are spacious, some with vaulted wooden ceilings, and all have glorious views across the Garfagnana valley.

Prices range from £310,000 for a two-bedroom apartment and from £568,000 for a three-bedroom villa. The main towns are Barga and Castelnuovo di Garfagnana. With its walled historic centre, Barga is a charmer — Scottish singer Paolo Nutini’s family hail from here.

The town is home to a large contingent of Scots, and at the end of July it even holds an annual Fish and Chip festival.

Florence is an hour and 45 minutes away by car, but just 50 minutes to the south is the bustling town of Lucca, where Puccini was born. It is full of historic buildings with a  famous summer music festival in July.

This year, Elton John, B.B. King and James Blunt performed under the stars in the Piazza Napoleone.

‘Property in the area is excellent value for money,’ says Linda Travella, of Casa Travella. Northern Tuscany is more accessible than the south in her opinion, with Pisa between one hour and an hour-and-a-half away from most locations.

There are also a number of main and local stations with regular services. She is selling a three-bedroom, semi-detached stone house with cellars, patio and garden, in the hamlet of Ponte Coccia, six miles from Barga, for £87,000.

This is on the road to Abetone, which in winter becomes a ski resort. And in a hamlet near Molazzana, two-and-a-half miles from Barga, a two-bedroom apartment with garden is on the market for £118,000.
