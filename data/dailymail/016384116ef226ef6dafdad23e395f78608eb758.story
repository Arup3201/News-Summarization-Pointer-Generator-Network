Search crews will send a robotic 
submarine deep into the Indian Ocean on Monday for the first time to try
 to determine whether underwater signals detected by sound-locating 
equipment are from the missing Malaysian plane's black boxes, the leader
 of the search effort said.

The
 crew on board the Australian navy's Ocean Shield will launch the 
unmanned underwater vehicle Monday evening, said Angus Houston, the head
 of a joint agency coordinating the search off Australia's west coast.

The Bluefin 21 autonomous sub can create a three-dimensional sonar map 
of the area to chart any debris on the seafloor.

The
 move comes after crews picked up a series of underwater sounds over the
 past two weeks that were consistent with an aircraft's black boxes.

Bluefin: The remote subs will search the ocean floor for any sign of the missing plane, which was last heard from more than a month ago

'We haven't had a single detection in six days, so I guess it's time to go under water,' Houston said.

Prime
 Minister Tony Abbott raised hopes last week when he said authorities 
were 'confident' the four underwater signals that have been detected are
 coming from the black boxes on Flight 370, which vanished March 8 
during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing.

But
 Houston warned that while the signals are a promising lead, the public 
needs to be realistic about the challenges facing search crews, who are 
contending with an extremely remote, deep patch of ocean.

'The search area is new to man,' he said.

'I
 would caution you against raising hopes that the deployment of the 
autonomous underwater vehicle will result in the detection of the 
aircraft wreckage - it may not.

'However, this is the 
best lead we have, and it must be pursued vigorously. Again, I emphasize
 that this will be a slow and painstaking process.'

His assessment came after it emerged that Malaysian military investigators believe the missing plane was 'thrown around like a fighter jet' just after it lost contact with the authorities in a bid to dodge radar.

Flight MH370 is thought to have climbed to heights of 45,000ft - 10,000ft above its normal altitude - before plummeting to just below 5,000ft.

The
 plane's two black boxes, which contain flight data and cockpit voice 
recordings, have beacons that emit 'pings' so they can be more easily 
found, but the beacons' batteries last only about a month, and it has 
been more than a month since the plane vanished.

The
 Australian navy ship Ocean Shield has been dragging a U.S. Navy device 
called a towed pinger locator through the water to listen for any sounds
 from the beacons.

Over the past 10 days, the equipment has picked up 
four separate signals.

The
 Bluefin sub takes six times longer to cover the same area as the ping 
locator, and the two devices can't be used at the same time.

It will begin searching an area 5km by 8km and will be launched for a second search 24 hours later.

Crews were 
hoping to detect additional signals before sending down the sub, so they
 could triangulate the source and zero in on where exactly the black 
boxes may be.

But it has
 been 38 days since the plane disappeared, and search crews haven't 
picked up any new sounds since Tuesday, suggesting that the devices' 
batteries may now be dead. That is why officials will now being using 
the Bluefin, Houston said.

The
 submarine will take 24 hours to complete each mission: two hours to 
dive to the bottom, 16 hours to search the seafloor, two hours to return
 to the surface, and four hours to download the data, Houston said. In 
its first deployment, it will search a 40-square-kilometer 
(15-square-mile) section of seafloor.

The
 black boxes could contain the key to unraveling the mystery of what 
happened to Flight 370 after it disappeared with 239 people on board. 
Investigators believe the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean 
based on a flight path calculated from its contacts with a satellite and
 analysis of its speed and fuel capacity. But they still don't know why.

Meanwhile,
 officials were investigating an oil slick not far from the area where 
the underwater sounds were detected, Houston said. Crews have collected a
 sample of the oil and are sending it back to Australia for analysis, a 
process that will take several days.

The 'pings' were possibly emitted by the Malaysia flight's black box, which puts a strict time limit on the search, as the black box only has about a month of battery power, and has been missing for a month already

Working alongside ships and aircraft from seven other nations, the two Royal Navy vessels face the same race against time to find the black box flight recorder

The
 oil does not appear to be from any of the ships in the area, but 
Houston cautioned against jumping to any conclusions about its source.

A
 visual search for debris on the ocean surface was continuing on Monday 
over 47,600 square kilometers (18,400 square miles) of ocean about 2,200
 kilometers (1,400 miles) northwest of the west coast city of Perth. A 
total of 12 planes and 15 ships would join the two searches.

But
 Houston said that the visual search operation would be ending in the 
next two to three days.

Officials haven't found a single piece of debris
 linked to the plane, and Houston said the chances that any would be 
have 'greatly diminished.'

'We've
 got no visual objects,' he said. 'The only thing we have left at this 
stage is the four transmissions and an oil slick in the same vicinity, 
so we will investigate those to their conclusion.'

The ship is designed for long stays at sea, and could potentially continue its search for up to 60 days

Also aiding Australian vessel Ocean Shield in the search effort is the U.K nuclear submarine HMS Tireless

Complicating
 matters further is the depth of the ocean in the search area.

The 
seafloor is about 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) below the surface, which is
 the deepest the Bluefin can dive.

Officials are looking for other 
vehicles that could help to retrieve any wreckage, should the Bluefin 
find any.

Houston's gloomy outlook will be met with mixed emotions by relatives of the mostly Chinese passengers.

Some
 are still clinging to hope that the aircraft has not plunged into the 
Ocean and sunk, but has crashed or landed somewhere on land, giving 
those on board a chance of surviving.

But other relatives have accepted that their loved ones are lost, but want closure with the discovery of the wreckage and recovery of bodies.
