The discovery of the bodies of two women in an abandoned Atlanta house have police there searching for a possible serial killer.   

Nicole Startell's remains were found  'badly decomposed' and stuffed inside a closet. Police believe the 31-year-old was killed months ago.

Heather Camp's body was discovered tucked under a sheet. The 33-year-old had only been dead a few days when officers found her.

Gruesome: The body of Nicole Sartell, pictured, was found in a home on Madrona Street in Atlanta, Georgia, December 19. Also found was the body of 33-year-old Heather Camp 

Authorities first found Camp's body hidden by a sheet in a bedroom - and Sartell's stashed in the bedroom closet as police executed a search warrant, WXIA-TV reported.

Sartell disappeared in August and the closet containing her body was nailed closed, according to WSB-TV.

Both slain women were later identified by the medical examiner's office, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

A neighbor of Sartell  named Charles Freeman told WSB-TV last week 'I put out posters on her with a reward with anybody that knows her whereabouts and we never had heard anything.'

'I wish I knew for sure if it was [Sartell] because it would ease my heart,' he also said at the time. 'She was like my daughter and I loved her very much.' 

Another neighbor, Larry Powers, told WSB-TV of the house 'Unfortunately there's a lot of wrong activity over there and the door won't lock. It's basically easy for people to come in and out.'  

Scene: Capt. Paul Guerrucci has said that the murders took place inside the home

Investigation: Authorities are seen at the Madrona Street home where the bodies of Heather Camp and Nicole Sartell were found 

At the time, Capt. Paul Guerrucci with the Atlanta Police Department told the affiliate station 'The body [found inside the closet] was badly decomposed, but the house, in general, was not in good order.

'There appears to be people living in the house. There's no running water or electricity, so it looks like they might be squatting in the house.' 

WSB-TV reported that in 2014 'police have been called to the house 14 times for prostitution, drugs and fighting.'

Speaking to WXIA-TV, Guerrucci said 'We're still in the beginning stages. We can't rule out anything, but they're definitely connected, because they're in the same house, so that's highly probable.'

The murders took place inside the home, he also said.

Camp's body was inside the Madrona Street home for a few days, police told WXIA-TV.

Pastor Juanita Shorter told MyFoxAtlanta that both Sartell and Camp had attended services at True Church of God Outreach Ministry.

'I had this feeling... that was my God baby [Sartell] in the closet,' she said.
