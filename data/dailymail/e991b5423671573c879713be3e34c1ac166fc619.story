A young woman whose mother claims she has stage 3 brain cancer is saying she is a 'liar and a fraud.'

Jessica went on the Dr. Phil show to confront her mother Patricia, who also claims she has suffered 17 strokes, flatlined twice in the past year and at one point in the hospital lost 100 pounds in six days. 

Patricia says all these things are true, which makes the fact that she is now a self-proclaimed world record weightlifter even more impressive.

Confrontation: Jessica took her mother on Dr. Phil (above) to confront her and try to get her help

'I have 12 titles in weightlifting, and I have cancer,' says Patricia at the beginning of the program.

That is not what Jessica believes however. She says her mother has never had cancer.

Instead, Jessica explains, she had brain surgery in 2010 after a blood vessel burst in her head, leaving her with a plate in her head.

Patricia however claims she discovered she had brain cancer in 2012, and that the doctors 'removed her face, jaw and ear' to perform surgery.

They then rebuilt her head using mesh she claims, and she lost the ability to walk and talk following the surgery, and in the six days she was in the hospital went from 185 pounds to 85 pounds. 

She relearned to walk and talk, and this is when she began weightlifting and claimed multiple titles, something Jessica also claims is not true.

Squalor: Jessica also takes issue with the way her mother lives and how dirty her home is

Sad: Jessica also claims her mother neglects her animals, pointing out one dog cannot even open his eye

Patricia says she even won one of these titles a day after getting chemotherapy, but that she now avoids the treatment in favor of cannabis oil. 

That's not the only issue Jessica has with her mother, also bring up the horrific condition of her house, and her mistreatment of her dogs.

One of the poor animals cannot even open its eye.
