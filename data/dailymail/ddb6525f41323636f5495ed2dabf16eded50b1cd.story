An animal lover met her husband-to-be on a dating site after falling for the online profile picture of his black pet Labrador.

Katie Beddo, 31, from Darlington, County Durham, immediately thought 'his owner must be a bit of a laugh to do that', and decided to get in touch.

Farmer Richard Craggs, 30, had been on Match.com for months without success, so for a laugh switched his profile image to one of his pet pooch George.

Katie was smitten by cute George on Richard's profile - who now has a daughter, two year-old Labrador Ebony

But when dog-lover Katie spotted it she was so smitten by the cute Labrador she contacted RichardÂ  to praise him for his wit and adorable pet.

Five years on and the pair have married, have a 12 week-old daughter Bethany and live together at Katie's home.

George the dog even had an important role at the wedding as their ring-bearer, carrying a cushion in his mouth down the aisle.

Primary school teacher Katie said: 'I always wanted a dog so when I spotted George online it made me laugh and think 'Aww how cute!'

'I had only been on the site for a few weeks when I spotted the bizarre profile picture of George.

'When I clicked on it and read Richard's profile the idea he had used George's picture really tickled me so I contacted him through the site.

Richard's pet George is a working dog and helps him out on his brother and parent's family-run farm

'I messaged him saying 'Does your dog know you are looking for love?!'

'We got on great straight away and just weeks later went on our first date and two months later he even joined my family on holiday in Spain.

'As we jetted out he asked me 'So do I tell people I'm your friend or your boyfriend?'

'I said 'Go on then... my boyfriend' - and that was that.'

Richard's pet George is a proper working dog and helps him out on his brother and parent's family-run farm in Yarm, North Yorks.

As well as hooking Katie and Richard up, George also had a vital role in their nuptials when they tied the knot in the leafy North-East village of High Worth in December 2011.

About 18 months after they met online Richard proposed and the couple married the following year

Katie went on: 'About 18 months after we first met Richard proposed and we married the following year at the local church.

'George was the ring-bearer and looked so adorable.

'Now we have [our daughter] beautiful Bethany and George has his own daughter, a two year-old black Labrador called Ebony.'

Katie admits she may never have found Richard or George after dismissing at first the idea of going on a dating site.

She explained: 'Being a primary school teacher and in my late 20s most of my working day is spent with young children or women.

'Then when I went out with my friends most of them were already in stable relationships or even married with kids.

'Meeting single men my own age was becoming more difficult so my mum and best friends were telling me to give Internet dating a try.

'I thought basically it was not for me at all and went on it to prove my mum wrong.

'But in the end they proved me wrong as clicking on George's daft profile picture was the best decision I ever made!'

George was the ring-bearer 'and looked so adorable', says Katie

Match.com are hoping to unite more 
dog-lovers after launching the World's first dating event for 'lonely 
heart' dog owners and their single pets.

The 'Bark In The Park' event is on
 Saturday April 5, at London's Battersea Park. It will see single dog 
owners bringing along their single pets to find them a canine companion 
too.

Kate Taylor, dating and relationship expert at Match.com, said: 'We know that taking part in shared interest activities can be a great ice-breaker when meeting new people.

'There are few things that people are as passionate about as their dogs.

Katie added: 'I think it's a marvellous idea as Richard and I met through our mutual love of dogs.

'If it can happen to us it can happen to anyone out there.'
