Detectives were last night investigating the murders of three men whose bodies were dumped in ditches five miles apart.

Property developer Kevin Lee, 48, was found stabbed to death in a roadside ditch on Saturday. Four days later, two more bodies were found in a remote dyke a short drive away.

These men – one in his 30s and one in his 50s – have not been named. Police believe the three murders, which took place in Cambridgeshire, are linked.

Officers are also connecting the deaths to two separate stabbings which took place on Tuesday in Hereford – some 140 miles from where the bodies were found.

Married father Mr Lee, who rented out a number of properties in Peterborough, was last seen on Good Friday. His body was discovered close to nearby Newborough before the other two bodies were found in Thorney, a short drive away.

As a nationwide manhunt was launched for Mr Lee’s killer, a man and a woman whom police had been trying to trace were arrested on separate charges of attempted murder in connection with the Hereford attacks, in which two men were stabbed ten minutes apart.

One of those arrested, Gary Stretch, was said to be a tenant of Mr Lee’s who was facing eviction.

The 47-year-old, who stands at 7ft 3in and was described as looking like the ‘Incredible Hulk’, was last night still being interviewed on suspicion of attempted murder for the Hereford attacks.

His girlfriend Joanna Dennehy, 30, who was also arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, was detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act.

The day after the arrests, police were called by a farmer to say he had found two bodies on private land in Thorney.

Mr Lee’s family described his death as a ‘tragic loss’, saying in a statement: ‘We are devastated by Kevin’s death. He was a wonderful husband, father, loving brother and son.

‘His naturally infectious personality touched everyone who knew him.’

His friend Chris Wilson, a plasterer, said: ‘We have no idea why he would be targeted or what has happened.

‘This is not something that we are used to dealing with.’

Julie Gibbons, Stretch’s ex-partner and mother of his teenage children Charlie and Garry, said before his arrest he had been sharing a four-bedroom house with strangers.

Last night the three-storey property in Orton Goldhay where Stretch and Dennehy had been living was boarded up. They shared the house, which had been split into bedsits by Mr Lee, with a man called John who was in his 50s and a younger man.

A neighbour said: ‘We have had so many problems with that house. The noise, the mess, we have had stuff thrown at our dog.

‘We just had to have our carpet and beds replaced because we had an infestation of bed bugs come from there. Kevin had paid for our house to be fumigated last week.’

An estate agent from Bairstow Eves in Peterborough, which marketed Mr Lee’s properties, said: ‘He was an established landlord.

‘Mr Lee was always friendly and polite with our staff. We never had a problem with him. We’re surprised that someone would want to hurt him.’

The two men stabbed in Hereford were last night still being treated in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

One is described as having serious injuries and the other is in a critical condition.

A 32-year-old man and a 23-year-old man arrested in connection with the murder of Mr Lee over the weekend have been released on bail.

Leslie Layton, 36, appeared at Peterborough Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday charged with perverting the course of justice. Layton, from Orton Goldhay, was remanded in custody until his next court appearance on Wednesday.

Detective Superintendent Jeff Hill from Cambridgeshire Police said: ‘These events are naturally very concerning and local people are understandably shocked. However, the deaths are being linked and treated as part of the same isolated incident over the Easter weekend.

Superintendent Ivan Powell, from Herefordshire Constabulary, said of the Hereford attacks: ‘These appear to have been two separate, unprovoked assaults on members of the public.’
