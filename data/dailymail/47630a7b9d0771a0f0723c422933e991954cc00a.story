A notorious prison that has held some of France's most famous inmates has opened its heavily guarded doors while it undergoes a major renovation project. 

Now a series of fascinating new photographs reveal what life was like behind the razor wire topped walls of Paris' infamous La Santé jail over its colourful 147 year history.

Opened in 1867, the fortress prison in Paris' 14th district has held some of France's most notorious criminals, including the international terrorist known as 'Carlos the Jackal,' Nazi collaborator Maurice Papon and rogue trader Jerome Kerviel.

Empty: Paris' infamous La Santé jail has been closed for four years while it undergoes a major revamp

The last 60 inmates left the crumbling prison in the summer and it is not due to re-open its doors until 2019

The last 60 inmates left the crumbling prison in the summer to make way for the massive four year regeneration project. The jail is due to reopen in 2019 and will have 800 beds. 

In 2000 La Santé sparked a parliamentary inquiry after its chief medical officer, Véronique Vasseur, published a diary chronicling overcrowding and brutal conditions faced by inmates.

At the time the jail, that was built to hold 1,400 inmates, housed 2,300 people.  Following the report a number of the most derelict blocks were closed and the four year revamp was ordered by justice minister Christiane Taubira.

An official report published in 2012 highlighted the building's 'decrepit and humid walls,' and 'faulty window locks', among other defects.

La Santé, named after a neighbouring hospital, first became infamous in the 20th century as the site of most of France's public executions.

More recently it has become know for its A-list inmates.

Carlos the Jackal, is a Venezuelan terrorist, did time at La Santé after he was jailed for life in 1975 for the murder of an informant for the French government and two French counter-intelligence agents.

Poet Guillaume Apollinaire spent a week in jail there in 1911 after he was briefly accused of the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. 

Gangster Jacques Mesrine and François Besse were the first to escape from La Santé after holding two prison guards hostage and stealing their uniforms

Gangster Jacques Mesrine and François Besse were the first to escape from La Sante in the 1970s, after holding two prison guards hostage and stealing their uniforms.

The most spectacular jailbreak was staged by the wife of bank robber, Michel Vaujour, who landed a helicopter on the prison roof in 1986.

Other notorious inmates include, businessman Bernard Tapie, found guilty of a match-fix scandal in 1995, and Nazi collaborator Maurice Papon. 

Only a handful of prison guards remain at the closed jail while the four year revamp is taking place at the notorious prison
