A mechanic has built the world's smallest campervan which has a tiny 4ft by 4ft living space.

Despite its confined size the pedal-powered mini mobile home still has room to squeeze in four seats, a stove, a sink, a table and a bed.

Dubbed the 'cramper-van', the invention by custom car fanatic Andy Saunders, is a mash-up of an old Bedford Bambi van and a Butlins-style pedal cart.

Compact space: The van has a sink plumbed in and a gas hob - as well as a very small table. The tiny vehicle cost £1,000 to build

It may come with all the mod cons, but for campers more used to the wide open spaces of the great outdoors its bijou living area could take some getting used to.

A clever use of space means that inside the minuscule motor's cabin seats for four people, although one of the seats folds down over the two-ring hob and sink.

The roof space extends out by 2ft 6ins, providing enough room for a small bed.

The only other thing that sets it aside 
from its bigger brothers is its lack of an engine, instead relying on 
pedal power to pull it along.

It is officially classed as a bicycle so doesn't have to be registered to go out on the roads - although it must be fitted with lights if it is going out after dark.

The 'cramper-van' was dreamed up by Andy who chopped 6ft off the front of a Bedford campervan and attached it to the pedal cart before refitting the interior.

It took around two weeks to make and cost him £1,000 in materials.

Andy, owner of Kampers and Kars in Poole, Dorset, said: 'We think our mini camper is the smallest camper in the world. I certainly don't know of anything else smaller.

'The Bedford Bambi was the smallest camper van ever made, and we've shaved about 6ft off that. If there was anything smaller I'd be very surprised.'

Andy, 50, has made a name for himself creating weird and wonderful custom cars including a Picasso-inspired multi-coloured Citroen 2CV, a mini Mini and 21-inch tall car.

Andy added: 'The mini camper really wasn't planned - it was just one of those things that popped into my head, which is how the best ideas come about.

Tea for two: The cosy space inside the vehicle - which doesn't leave a lot of leg room as the whole vehicle is just 4ft by 4ft

Compact: Andy (front) and Martin squeeze into the back of their tiny mobile home which is far smaller than the one that can be seen in the background (left)

Fold down: The vehicle has four seats. The back two seats fold down over the hob and sink to make the best use of the limited space

'One of my salesmen was talking about a pedal bike and I just thought why not combine it with a camper van.

'The idea evolved at the speed of light - within 15 minutes we had sourced a pedal bike and a camper van.

'We had this old scrap Bedford Bambi camper that had been sitting around for about four years which was perfect for the camper section.

'It can be pedalled but you do have to have legs like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

'You certainly wouldn't want to go camping in it around too many hills.

'We wanted the camper to be finished to the highest quality.

'Inside it's fully insulated and upholstered, it has a twin hob to cook on, a sink to wash up in.

'It has four seats although you have to make sure you're finished cooking because one of those seats is on the hob.

'It's got a big side window and even a small bed - you have to tuck up a bit but it's perfect for a power nap.

'It is a little cramped but it's all good fun - everyone who sees it says "wow".'
