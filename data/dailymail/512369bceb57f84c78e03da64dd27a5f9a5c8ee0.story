A heavily-tattooed man with an inked eyeball has been jailed for 22 years for attempted murder and other offenses after shooting at police officers who were investigating a string of burglaries in Alaska.

Jason Barnum, 39, who is nicknamed 'Eyeball', went on a crime spree that involved stealing cars and burglarizing homes to feed his heroin addiction, before driving to Merrill Field Inn in Anchorage.

But while he was at the motel, officers noticed a vehicle linked to the burglaries in the parking lot and went to Barnum's room to investigate, at which point the criminal opened fire from the bathroom.

Two officers shot back, hitting Barnum - whose face is covered with skulls and skeletons, lips are rimmed with skeletal teeth and right eyeball is tattooed black - in the right arm, before arresting him.

Although a deputy was injured in the 2012 attack when a bullet slipped down the back of his vest, he reportedly returned to work several days later after receiving a number of stitches.

On Friday, Barnum pleaded guilty to attempted murder, a consolidated first-degree burglary charge and third-degree weapons misconduct, according to the Alaska Dispatch.

During the hearing, he reportedly acknowledged the  dangerous lifestyle choices that had led him to commit his crimes, saying: 'I tried man... I apologize to the folks who are hurt from this.'

He was sentenced to 22 years behind bars at Anchorage Superior Court, deputy district attorney Clint Campion, said. The attempted-murder charge carried the most severe penalty of 20 years.

Scene: The shooting occurred at Merrill Field Inn (pictured) in Anchorage in September 2012. No-one died

No longer free: During an investigation, police found that Barnum - who is seen on Facebook posing alongside a dog on a snowy mountain (above) and wearing a cross necklace- was likely high during the shooting

During an investigation, police found that Barnum - who is pictured on Facebook wearing an iron cross necklace that features a swastika in the middle - was likely high during the shooting.

Following the incident near Merril Field airport in September 2012, the offender engaged police a two-hour standoff which eventually culminated in his arrest on 33 criminal counts, KTUU reported.

He later admitted to vehicle theft and burglary, citing heroin addiction as his motive for the crimes.

Alarmingly, most of the burglaries occurred when residents were in their homes. 'When you go into people's homes at night, that’s risky behavior and not normal for burglars,' Lt. Anthony Henry said.

In 2012, Barnum's bail was set at $500,000 by a district judge. He has remained jail since then.

Speaking to the newspaper, Mr Campion said he was satisfied with Barnum's sentence - but added that if the case had gone to trial, the criminal may have been jailed for longer. 

'But there’s always risk with going to trial,' he said. 'There was a lot of litigation in the case, some of which went our way and some that was still undecided.' 

He added that Barnum had an extensive criminal history. Court records reportedly show run-ins with the law as far back to 1993, including burglary charges in 1994, 2000 and 2005.
