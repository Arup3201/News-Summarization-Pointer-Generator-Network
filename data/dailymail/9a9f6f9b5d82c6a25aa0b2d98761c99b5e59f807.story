A porn video entitled 'Sexy abbe' was accidentally uploaded to a U.S. state department's website, and stayed online for a week before it was spotted and removed.

The adult films, one entitled 'Sexy babe', were spotted on the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, site.

The Columbus Dispatch reported that the videos were accidentally uploaded to the department's oil and gas division's page on February 21.

Two pornographic videos were uploaded to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources website after a member of the public 'accidentally' added them

The pornography clips appeared with a host of music files and other miscellaneous material.

The mishap was caused by a glitch on the site, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources said.

A function of the site, which is designed to allow companies to transfer large files including maps, to the site, was exploited Eileen Corson said.

She said no credentials were required to upload material at the time, allowing any member of the public, to transfer whatever data they want to the department's site.

The pornography videos were up on the site for a week, before someone spotted them and they were removed on Friday.

When the department were notified they immediately took the material down, and Ms Corson said credentials will be required to transfer any documents in the future.

Ms Corson said the site was not hacked because it remained outside of the firewall with 'no roots to the inside network'.

'Someone was using it as cloud storage,' she said. 'Unfortunately, that happens.'

The footage appeared on the Division of Oil and Gas page, and were online for a week before they were spotted and the department immediately removed them
