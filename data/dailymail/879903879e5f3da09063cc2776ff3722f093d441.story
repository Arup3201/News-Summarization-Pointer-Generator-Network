A Pakistan national bludgeoned his ex-girlfriend to death with a hammer two months after he had asked police to deport him from Britain, a court heard today.

Muhammed Niazi told officers he wanted to return to his native country after splitting up with the mother of his two-year-old daughter and becoming depressed.

But he was turned away and told to contact the Home Office.

Accused: Muhammed Niazi, 28 (left) admits the manslaughter of his Filipino ex-partner Charito Cruz (right) but denies murdering her in September last year

Weeks later the 28-year-old went on to carry out the brutal killing of Charito Cruz in front of their young girl last September.

Niazi had savagely murdered his 
37-year-oldÂ  ex-partner after discovering she was flirting with an 
ex-boyfriend on Facebook, an Old Bailey murder jury were told today.

The
court heard that Niazi said his Filipino partner, who he had met on an 
online dating site, 'deserved' to die because she had been cheating on 
him.

Niazi has since 
admitted killing Cruz, but denies murdering her after claiming he was 
not fully in control of his actions due to 'severe depression'.

Ms
Bobbie Cheema, prosecuting, told the court: 'In June or July last year,
the defendant went to Kingston Police Station and asked if he could be 
deported back to Pakistan.

Battered: The savage attack took place last year on Cambridge Road in Kingston, Surrey

'It would appear he realised the relationship with his partner was not going to be long-term.

'He killed her with many deliberate blows to the head using a hammer, and she bled to death on the floor of their sitting room.

The prosecutor said Niazi was not depressed when he carried out the killing, but instead acted out of 'anger and revenge' when he he thought his partner was being unfaithful.

Both the prosecution and defence are to call psychiatrists to give evidence on the killer's mental state, jurors heard.

At the time of her death, Ms Cruz had been holding down two jobs to support both their daughter and Niazi, who was not legally allowed to work in the UK.

Plea: Niazi, 28, has admitted killing his ex-girlfriend but denies murder at his Old Bailey trial on the grounds of diminished responsibility

She is said to have been 'disaffected' because he failed to carry out any housework despite being at home all day, while Niazi wrongly suspected she had begun a sexual affair with her ex-boyfriend.

Niazi, from Kingston, Surrey, admits manslaughter but denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

The trial continues.
