A man has been found dead on a beach where TV murder mystery Broadchurch was filmed.

The body of the man, thought to be in his late 40s, was discovered near the foot of a cliff in West Bay, Dorset.

The horrific sight was initially thought by locals from the town of Bridport to be part of the filming for the second series of the hit ITV drama.

Death: A man's body was found on the beach at West Bay in Dorset, where Broadchurch was filmed

Cordon: The beach was closed off by police as they investigated the scene of the incident

The first series of Broadchurch, which was broadcast in March and April this year, opened with the discovery of an 11-year-old boy's body on the beach.

Later on in the series, a newsagent who is wrongly accused of killing the boy commits suicide nearby.

The real-life tragedy came to light yesterday morning when a member of the public spotted the unidentified man lying dead while she was walking her dog.

The area was cordoned off by police as they investigated the circumstances of the incident.

Investigation: Police say they do not believe the circumstances of the man's death are suspicious

A resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'At first I thought they had started filming the second series of Broadchurch, then I realised it was real.'

Another Twitter user said: 'Can't believe a body has been found on West Bay beach. People thought they were filming for Broadchurch series two. Such sad news.'

A spokesman for Dorset Police said that the man's injuries were consistent with falling from a great height.

Detective Sergeant Steve Broadhurst said: 'While we are keeping an open mind all the signs are that this is not suspicious.'

Maggie Ray, mayor of Bridport, described the incident as 'very sad news'

Maggie Ray, mayor of Bridport, said: 'This is very sad news, I can only say what everyone else has been saying and that it is an awful thing to happen.

'I feel for the family and send them our condolences, we now need to find out what exactly has happened here.'

The second series of Broadchurch is set to begin filming next year.
