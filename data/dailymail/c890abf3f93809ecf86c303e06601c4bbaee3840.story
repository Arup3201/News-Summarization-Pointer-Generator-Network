Proposed changes to the official Body Mass Index mean tall people may not be as overweight as they thought, while those under 5ft 7ins could find themselves with a few extra pounds to shift.

Researchers at Oxford University say the formula currently used to calculate the BMI is flawed and renders tall people too fat and short people too thin.

Up until now BMI has been calculated simply by dividing a person's weight by their height to give a rough estimate of amount of fat they are carrying as a percentage.

Fatter: Actor Danny DeVito

Thinner: Cyclist Chris Hoy

6ft 2ins                                       OLD: Overweight: 13st 13lb : Obese 16st 10lb                                          NEW: Overweight 16st 10lb : Obese 17st 9lb

6ft                                                    OLD: Overweight: 13st 3lb : Obese 15st 12lb                                          NEW: Overweight 13st 10lb : Obese 16st 7lb

5ft 10ins                                       OLD: Overweight: 12st 5lb : Obese 15st                                                   NEW: Overweight 12st 11lb : Obese 15st 5lb

5ft 8ins                                         OLD: Overweight: 11st 11lb : Obese 14st 2lb                                            NEW: Overweight 11st 13lb : Obese 14st 4lb

5ft 7ins                                             NO CHANGE : Overweight: 11st 6lb : Obese 13st 10lb

5ft 4ins                                          OLD: Overweight: 10st 6lb : Obese 12st 7lb                                             NEW: Overweight 10st 3lb : Obese 12st 4lb

5ft 2ins                                               OLD: Overweight: 9st 11lb : Obese 11st 11lb                                                  NEW: Overweight 9st 6lb : Obese 11st 5lb

5ft                                    OLD: Overweight: 9st 3lb : Obese 11st                                                   NEW: Overweight 8st 10lb : Obese 10st 6lb

It means superfit but stocky athletes such as Britain's Olympic hero sir Chris Hoy would no longer be classified as overweight while the little but large like actor Danny DeVito would have to lose more to reach their ideal weight.

But the research team points out that
 it does not take into account the fact that people's weight tends to 
grow with their height to the power of 2.5 giving taller people more 
room to expand.

It means a strapping person of 6ft 
2ins tall would now need to hit 14st 10lb as opposed to just 13st 13lb 
to be classified as overweight and a hefty 17st 9lb as opposed to 16st 
10lb to be obese.  

At the other end of the scale, 
someone standing 5ft tall would now be classified as overweight at just 
8st 10lb compared to the old limit of 9st 3lb and would be obese at 10st
 6lb compared to 11st. 

Study: Researchers at Oxford University say the formula currently used to calculate the BMI is flawed and renders tall people too fat and short people too thin

Lead researcher Professor Nick 
Trefethen told the Times: 'BMI divides the weight by too large a number 
for short people and by too small a number for tall people.

'So short people are misled into 
thinking that they are thinner than they are and tall people people are 
misled into thinking they are fatter.'

According to the The Obesity Management Association charity people should measure their body mass 
index (BMI) every three months and should know their own BMI and that of their family members.

The charity said the NHS is struggling to cope with the rising tide of obese patients.

'We cannot go on letting our National Health Service pick up the pieces as weight balloons in both children and adults,' said OMA trustee Robert Houtman as he launched the charity's My Weight, My Future campaign.

Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, added: 'Everyone should make a point of checking their BMI to see if they are keeping within a healthy weight range. If they are not, that should be the time to do something about it.

It is quite easy unconsciously to put on extra pounds and, once you have, put yourself at risk of acquiring the nasty diseases associated with obesity.

'If you have children, ensuring that their BMI stays safely within a healthy range is arguably even more important.'
