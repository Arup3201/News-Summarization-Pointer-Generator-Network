She was one of Britain's best-loved leaders and her family is still grieving her death less than two years ago.

But that has not stopped the BBC from broadcasting a 'sick' story fantasising about the murder of Margaret Thatcher.

The work by Booker Prize-winning author Dame Hilary Mantel is to be read on Radio 4's Book At Bedtime early in the New Year.

The short story is about a middle-class housewife who unwittingly lets an IRA hitman into her home

The decision to air The Assassination Of Margaret Thatcher has led to further accusations of 'intrinsic and endemic' Left-wing bias at the BBC.

Former Cabinet minister Lord Tebbit said: 'It is a sick book from a sick mind and it's being promoted by a sick broadcasting corporation.' 

The short story is about a middle-class housewife who unwittingly lets an IRA hitman into her home. It concludes with the terrorist taking aim at the Prime Minister and remarking: 'Rejoice, f****** rejoice' – a parody of Mrs Thatcher's comments when she announced a British victory during the 1982 Falklands War.

Conservative MPs said it was an 'astonishing' decision to broadcast the story on January 9, while Baroness Thatcher's family were still grieving. 

Angie Bray said: 'It's disappointing and very surprising that the BBC could not find a book that would not have caused such offence.'

Lord Tebbit, pictured to the right of Margaret Thatcher in 1987, said: 'It is a sick book from a sick mind and it's being promoted by a sick broadcasting corporation' 

Conor Burns, Lady Thatcher's closest confidant and adviser in her final days, said: 'Given the public controversy that surrounded Hilary Mantel's original publication of this twisted little story from her disordered mind, it seems calculating of the BBC to choose it for Book At Bedtime.' 

Andrew Bridgen said: 'The BBC aren't even subtle in their bias – it's intrinsic and endemic.' 

Lord Bell, a former adviser to Lady Thatcher, said: 'If the BBC had any real sensibility it would leave that subject alone with an election just five months away. It is inevitably going to be accused of political bias.'

Wolf Hall author Dame Hilary, who could not be contacted for comment yesterday, has said the work was inspired by her own fantasy about killing the former prime minister.

The BBC said: 'Book at Bedtime offers the best of modern and classic literature and, in doing so, presents a wide range of perspectives from around the world.

'The work of Hilary Mantel – a double Booker Prize-winning author – is of significant interest to the public and we will not shy away from the controversial subject matter that features in one of the four stories read across the week.'
