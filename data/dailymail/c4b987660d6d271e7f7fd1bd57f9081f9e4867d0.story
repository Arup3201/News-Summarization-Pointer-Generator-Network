With her flowing blonde hair, flawless skin and Hollywood heartthrob boyfriend, Blake Lively has seemingly got it all.

But the actress, who shot to fame as Serena Van der Woodsen on Gossip Girl, has revealed that she isn't as confident as she may appear and even uses her hair to hide behind.

Speaking to Hello! magazine, the 26-year-old said: 'Honestly I am a shy person and my hair is a safety net for me, so I love to have it down and full and relaxed.

'Often you see people on the red carpet with tight-up dos, but that makes me feel stiff.'

Much to our annoyance, the Green Lantern actress revealed that her perfectly coiffed hair doesn't take much effort.

Blake explains that she simply applies a hair mask (she loves Kerastase Reflection Chroma Captive Hair Masque), doesn't rinse it completely from the ends and then dries it until it's slightly wet, pops it into a ballerina bun and lets it dry.

She also loves to apply extra virgin coconut oil to the ends before shampooing, a trick Miranda Kerr also swears by.

Blake also claims that she wears 'very little make-up' in her day-to-day life but cites fragrance as 'essential' because it evokes memories and emotions for her.

Another beauty trick she swears by is the power of eyelash glue, which she and her team use to stick her red carpet gowns to her skin to avoid any styling mishaps.

As for fashion, she looks to icons such as Katharine Hepburn and Grace Kelly for style inspiration.

'They looked like princesses and, for me, that is style. I always want to wear clothes that my children will one day look back on and say, "Oh, you looked amazing - why didn't you keep that?" Not, "Oh my God - I can't believe you wore that",' she said.

While she is minimalistic when it comes to her beauty regime, Blake loves to dress up. She said: 'I'm not happy wearing sweats [jogging bottoms], because I love dressing up so much.

'I liken myself to a little girl having a tea party at the house all of the time. I actually dress up more in my home than I do walking down the street just because it is so much fun to play dress-up.'

Blake,
 who recently completed the romantic drama The Age Of Adaline, has been 
keeping busy while her husband of nearly two years, Ryan Reynolds, 
shoots his film Woman In Gold in the UK.

She’s 
currently decorating the New York loft that she purchased with Reynolds, searching for both contemporary and antique finds for those 
hard-to-fill places.

'I’m
 very lucky to be with someone who has better taste than me,' Blake told
 Lucky magazine of her husband Ryan. 'We influence each other in different ways.'

'It's
 also a lot more rewarding', she said, adding: 'With film and TV, you 
don’t see the results for months. Building a home, you get immediate 
gratification.'
