As a young Phillip Hughes was working his way up in the cricketing world, his father Greg was always right there to support him.

And Greg Hughes was there on Thursday when family and cricketing legends gathered around the 25-year-old to say goodbye.

The distraught Mr Hughes was seen with his arms around his sobbing wife Virginia as they left St Vincent's Hospital after their son passed away due to the shocking injuries he sustained when he was knocked down by a bouncer at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday afternoon.

The father and son, from Macksville in northern New South Wales, shared a special bond and Mr Hughes followed the batsman around the world to watch him play.

As Hughes was working his way up in the cricketing world, his father Greg was always there to support him

'When he was a kid, I used to cart him everywhere to play,' Mr Hughes said, right before his son was picked to represent Australia for the first time on 2009, Brisbane Times reported.

'I wasn't going to put him on a bus and tell him, "Off you go". I just wanted him to enjoy it, and I wanted to be there with him if he wanted me there.'

Shortly after, Hughes was chosen to represent Australia for the first time during the team's South Africa tour. He went on to score two centuries.

Mr Hughes, a banana farmer, sounded in awe of his then-20-year-old son when he spoke about the determination and hard work that got him to that point.

In a statement, the family said 'Cricket was Phillip's life' and they shared that love of the game with him

He said Hughes had moved away from their rural family home to be in Sydney for his final year of high school.

'He just said, "This is what I've got to do". He plotted his path and he's starting to get a few rewards,' Mr Hughes said.

'He's getting what he deserves. When he was younger, most afternoons he'd hit between 120 and 150 balls and then do his fitness stuff on top of it. He did things properly.

'I didn't do much - I just fed the machine for him. Most kids probably went to their Tuesday and Thursday afternoon training sessions and that was it. He couldn't stop. He's one out of the box.'

On Thursday, Australia team captain Michael Clarke choked back tears as he read out a statement from the Hughes family following the death of the 25-year-old.

'We're devastated at the loss of our much loved son and brother, Phillip,' Clarke said.

'Cricket was Phillip's life and we as a family shared that love of the game with him.'

The captain when Hughes made his Test debut, Ricky Ponting, was at St Vincent's Hospital and at the SCG as Hughes' family, friends and teammates gathered to say goodbye to the 25-year-old.

Hughes' parents Greg and Virginia, his sister Megan and brother Jason – who first got him into the sport – looked devastated as they left the hospital on Thursday evening.

Greg, Virginia and Megan walked arm in arm as they entered Cricket NSW headquarters at the SCG, where players past and present met to pay their respects to their fallen teammate.
