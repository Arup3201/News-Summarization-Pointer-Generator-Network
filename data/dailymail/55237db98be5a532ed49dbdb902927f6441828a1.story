Arrest: David Ellis Edwards was arrested in connection with assaults on boys aged between 11 and 14, which were allegedly carried out while he was the principal of two schools

A former school principal has been arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a pupil while the victim's parents were sat outside the room.

David Ellis Edwards, 49, is accused of attacking at least three boys during his time as the head of two schools in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

Police claim that between 2009 and 2011 he molested the boys who are all in the age range 11 to 14.

During this time he worked at Douglas Byrd Middle School and Ramsey Street Alternative School and at least one of the assaults are believed to have taken place in his office, while the victim's parents were in the next room.

Edwards, who has since resigned from his position at Douglas Byrd in August, was arrested on Friday.

He faces charges of a second-degree forcible sex offense, sexual acts with a student, taking indecent liberties with a minor and crimes against nature according to WTVD reported.

Cumberland County Sheriff's department spokeswoman Debbie Tanna told the Fayetteville Observer they 'believe there were more than the three victims'.

Despite the allegations facing the teacher, he denied his resignation was connected to the inquiry saying that he left the school to pursue other educational opportunities.

Victims: At least one of the alleged attacks took place at the Ramsey Street Alternative School, above, police said
