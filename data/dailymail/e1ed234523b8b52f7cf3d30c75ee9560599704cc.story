A hero teacher managed to fend off a knife-wielding teenager with a cardboard folder after the 13-year-old went on a classroom rampage, it emerged today.

The schoolboy is suspected of launching an attack on the member of staff - named only as Mr Westwood - at The Chase Technology College in Malvern yesterday, as well as a 13-year-old girl.

Pupils told how the boy burst into the classroom wearing his own clothes and a scarf covering his face, with Rambo-style camouflage paint smeared under his eyes.

Attack: Parents and students gathered outside the school this afternoon after the attack disrupted lessons. Many took their children home

Helicopter: West Mercia police deployed a helicopter in the hunt for the 13-year-old boy. Members of the public were been warned not to approach him

Speaking after school ended today, one said: 'People said he just ran in and went for him straight away.

'The teacher defended himself with a folder and that's when [he] ran out. I had seen him around but didn't know him.

Officers today confirmed that the manhunt had ended and that he was arrested on suspicion of wounding and carrying a bladed weapon.

Both victims sustained minor injuries which did not require stitches.

In a statement, Superintendent Mark Travis said: 'I am very pleased to announce that earlier today, a young male we had been searching for involved with an incident at the Chase School has been found.

'He is safe and well. He has currently been arrested and has been taken to Worcester police station where we are going to be working with his family over the coming hours to provide the appropriate support and also working with the school to make sure that the school can be open tomorrow for business as usual.' 

Police presence: Officers guarded the school for the whole of today

Eyewitnesses had reported seeing nine police cars and two dog vans outside the school as officers flooded the scene after the incident.

The force helicopter was also scrambled to join the search for the young suspect and the school was initially in lock-down with pupils kept in classrooms but parents were allowed to collect their children later in the morning.

One parent, whose 14-year-old daughter, attends the school said: "When I heard there had been a suspected stabbing at the school I was horrified.

The Chase Technology College, where the incident took place became an academy in November 2011 and is the largest school in Worcestershire with over 1,600 pupils.

It is located in the Barnards Green suburb of Malvern, adjacent to the sites of large technology company QinetiQ and Dytecna, in the Malvern Hills Science Park.

In its latest Ofsted report from February of this year, the school was rated as 'requiring improvement', despite being rated as 'good' on a previous inspection in 2011.

Inspectors noted that pupil's achievement, the quality of teaching and the leadership and management needed improving, however, pupils' behaviour and safety was deemed good.

'You don't expect this sort of thing to happen in Britain, let alone a place like Malvern. It's been a nightmare getting any information from the police or the school.

'I went and collected my daughter straight away when I heard what had happened. She was not in the class where it happened but it's shaken her.

'She's been in tears and says she saw dozens of kids screaming and police everywhere.'

A police description issued while the boy was on the run said he was white, about 5ft, 3 inches tall, with short spiky hair and glasses.

He was seen wearing dark grey trousers, a grey hooded jumper and may have a dark scarf covering his face. He was also carrying a dark rucksack. 

There was also a police presence at the school throughout the afternoon.

A spokesman for the college said: ''I can confirm that there was an incident this morning at school. At 8.45 am, one of our teachers and a 13-year-old female pupil both received minor injuries following an attack with a bladed instrument.

'The injuries did not require medical treatment and the assailant left the premises immediately after the incident.

'Plans were immediately implemented to ensure that all students and staff were safe. The police attended the school promptly and have assisted the school throughout the course of the day, enabling our lessons to return to normal by mid-morning. 

Attack: The pupil allegedly attacked another student and a teach at The Chase Technology College in Malvern

On the run: Police earlier appealed for information about the boy, and have warned others not to approach him

'I would like to praise our students and staff for remaining calm and continuing with their education throughout today.

'The school will be open tomorrow and will continue to operate normally. Support is available at the school to support anybody that has been affected by today's earlier incident.'

According to local media, the majority of pupils were taken home early.
