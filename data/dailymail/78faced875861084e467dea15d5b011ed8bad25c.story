A Florida nurse charged with murdering her male flatmate posted a video on Facebook in which she admits bashing his head against the floor, police said.

Rosemarie Farid, 40, is being held without bond after Donald Galvagni's battered body was discovered in the bathtub of his Sunrise home on July 2. A friend of his had called police requesting he be checked on.

In the video Farid, who according to her Facebook page is a nurse, assistant maid and cook, also admitted stealing the 64-year-old's phone so he couldn't call police and taking money from his wallet.Â

Farid claims to have worked at Servantry, which appears to be The Heart of Servant Ministry church in Sunrise, since 1990, and to have last year studied at West Broward School For Nursing Assistants.

She has posted close to 250 videos on her social media account, which lists her as being engaged.

Most involve her talking directly to the camera about her difficult relationship with her parents, her dog, or her living arrangements.

In one video her and a man she refers to, and who answers to, Donny, discuss the future of a dog that lives at the address. The fight between Farid and Mr Galvagni is believed to have been sparked by him letting her dog inside their flat.

In a series of Facebook status updates on June 30, the day Mr Galvagni died, Farid wrote on her profile page of 'having violent fantasies about taking revenge on Donny'.

'I'm so pissed off about having to live with Donny loser that It will be hard to not kick Donnys a** today. I'm in a violent mood and Donny has one coming from me, big time!'

She also wrote; 'Ofcourse (sic) I don't hit first, I let him go, then I'll finish it up.'

That same day she posted a video in which she described herself as mentally disturbed and dangerous while 'having fantasies about stabbing him in the neck.'

Farid said: 'I know that I can become pretty violent and I'm a pretty dangerous person when I'm driven to it.

'When I get to the point of the violent fantasies, then I have to get out, because I am mentally disabled.'

She then talks about his death: 'I took all of the money out of his wallet and I stole his phone. And I bashed his head on the floor a couple of times and got the floor all bloody.'

Farid was arrested for Mr Galvagni murder on Saturday. It has been reported that she was located at a Florida medical centre where she was being held following an unrelated incident.

Police officers have described finding a pool of blood in Mr Galvagni's living room, bloody wash cloths in the sink and a trail of blood leading from the hallway to a bathroom.

It is thought Mr Galvagni died from cardiac arrest after losing a substantial amount of blood.

Farid is understood to have told police that she got into an argument with Mr Galvagni before pushing him, causing him to fall and hit his head on the cement entrance to the bathroom.

She then got on top of him and smashed his head on the floor, it has been alleged.
