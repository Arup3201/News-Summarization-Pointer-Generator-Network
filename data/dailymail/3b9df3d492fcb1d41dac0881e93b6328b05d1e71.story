A Norwegian man could be imprisoned for cutting off his own beard and gluing it to another man's head to create a toupee.

He claims the recipient of the home-made hairpiece - who had a restraining order against him - wanted it because he was bald, according to the prosecutor in the case.

The man in his 40s is also being tried for a string of other petty crimes including burglary and theft following the alleged attack which took place in Hordaland county on Norway's west coast on Friday.

Harald Bilberg told the Bergens Tidende newspaper: 'He was bald, so the accused claims that they had agreed to create a toupee for the aggrieved party.  

'These incidents happened a long way out in the police district, and we therefore believe it is important that those who live there are protected.'

'We are not talking about serious crimes, but it's more of a nuisance. I must admit that I have never encountered such a case in my career.'

The man who has already been convicted of seven crimes and fined 13 times was in breach of a restraining order imposed to protect the recipient of the toupee.

Hordaland country's remoteness on Norway's west coast makes it very difficult for the police to access quickly during an emergency. 

Mr Bilberg said the frequency of the man's offences should be judged accordingly so he does not go on to commit new crimes.
