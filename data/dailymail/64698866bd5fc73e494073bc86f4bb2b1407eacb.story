A family who fell ill with severe vomiting and diarrhoea on holiday in Lanzarote have been awarded £3,200 in compensation.

Sue Hilton, from Chesterfield, had travelled to the Flamingo Beach Resort with her mother and two children in February this year to enjoy a relaxing family holiday.

Yet conditions at the hotel soon turned the holiday into a disaster. Food was reported to be served lukewarm, undercooked and often left uncovered in restaurants.

Flies were seen around the food, landing on fruits and cheeses. Miss Hilton also reported seeing cockroaches near eating areas and birds flying around indoor restaurants.

Four days into the holiday, Miss Hilton's daughter, who was 12 years old at the time, began experiencing symptoms of severe stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea.

It was only a few days later, as the family returned home, that Miss Hilton began experiencing similar symptoms.

Miss Hilton said: 'We were really looking forward to a relaxing family holiday but that was ruined by the conditions within the hotel.

'The food at the hotel was truly terrible and was never served at the right temperatures.' 

Miss Hilton had spoken to a number of guests who were affected by illness at the Flamingo Beach Resort.

Despite complaining to representatives around the hotel, Miss Hilton felt little was being done to rectify the problems at the hotel.

On the family's return to the UK, Miss Hilton contacted her tour operator, First Choice, in order to register a complaint against the hotel. 

After receiving a number of offers, including the offer of vouchers towards another holiday, Miss Hilton contacted Your Holiday Claims, a division of Farnworth Rose solicitors.

Head of travel law at Your Holiday Claims, Anne Thomson, said: 'We are delighted to have helped Miss Hilton and her family obtain compensation.

'When food and hygiene standards within hotels are poor, there is a risk of holidaymakers contracting serious illness.

'It is vital that all hotels ensure that high food hygiene standards are maintained in order to prevent such outbreaks of illness.' 

First Choice told Mail Online Travel the company does not comment on settlements.

Flamingo Beach Resort has also been contacted for comment.
