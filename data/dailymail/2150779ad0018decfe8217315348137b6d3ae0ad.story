Brazilian beauty Larissa Torres has only been living in Darwin for four months but her backside has already made a serious impression on the locals.

The 31-year-old was shocked when her derriere took out the inaugural crown of Darwin’s best booty at Nightcliff’s Beachfront Hotel on Saturday night.

Describing herself as the shy type, Larissa decided to flaunt her best asset because the evening’s proceeds went towards the Leukemia Foundation.

'My cousin died two years ago from Leukemia so I decided to enter for a good cause so it's not like showing off,' she said.

Her friends had been telling her for years that she should get her booty up on stage.

'They used to say "You have a nice butt - you should go in a competition" but I'm quite shy,' she said. 

Larissa said all nine contestants were nervous about shaking their butt on stage.

'We all wanted to go up together instead of separately but we couldn't,' she said. ' So we all had a few drinks beforehand.'

The bootilicious women had to first appear on stage in a white singlet and denim shots and then strip down to their bikini bottoms to dance their butts off for the second segment.

'I just told myself "I have to do it",' she said. 'It was a challenge which I enjoy because it makes me a stronger person.'

Larissa didn't presume for a second that she would win the hottest bum gong.

'All of the girls were really beautiful and have really nice bums so I wasn't expecting to win,' she said.

To keep her pert bottom in tip-top shape, Larissa used to bother with the gym but now prefers to do yoga and run outdoors.

The 31-year-old works out five days a week for an hour at a time and says variety is the spice of life.

'I always like trying new ways to exercise,' she said. 'Cardio is very important for your butt and so is Pilates and yoga.'

The sexy brunette says a woman's booty is held in high regard in her home country.

'Brazilian guys loves Brazilian butts - so i'ts just something that us Brazilian girls always look after because we know the guys like it
