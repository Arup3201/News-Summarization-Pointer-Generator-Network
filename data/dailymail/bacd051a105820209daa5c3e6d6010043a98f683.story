Imagine writing off a car worth almost half a million dollars. Now imagine it wasn't even yours.

That's the reality for one unlucky man who totalled his mate's $400,000 Lamborghini in Sydney on Saturday night.

While cruising through EdeNsor Park in the city's west, the driver of the charcoal V12-powered Lamborghini Murcielago came over the crest of a hill and ploughed into another car.

This Lamborghini Murcielago was written off on Saturday night when it ploughed into another car

That other vehicle, a white Honda SUV, was turning into its driveway, Nine News reported.

The 2007 model Lamborghini is completely written off as confirmed to the program by the car's driver, Vince, who said: 'Yeah it's a write off, there's nothing left of it'.

The Honda, driven by Kathy Barillaro, also looked a little worse for wear after it rolled 20 metres and came to a stop further down the street.

The 2007 model car was only purchased last weekend by two men who split the $400,000 price tag

Ms Barillaro was lucky and was only treated for minor injuries such as cuts, bruises and whiplash by paramedics at the scene, but did not suffer anything more serious.

'I don't know what happened, and I was just rolling and rolling and rolling', she said.

'All I heard was this loud bang, it sounded like a plane crash really', Kathy's husband Bruno Barillaro said. 

The driver of the Lamborghini, Vince, said the crash totally wrote off the luxury sports car

Police are investigating the crash but no one has been charged 

Vince said that he had purchased the car in partnership with a friend, and they had only picked up the car last weekend.

He also added that he wasn't too concerned about the car and was glad everyone involved in the accident was largely unharmed. 

Police told Daily Mail Australia they are investigating the incident and the possibility that speed was a factor, but no charges have been laid.
