Prince Charles and Duchess of Cornwall were given a very royal welcome after they checked into one of the most luxurious resorts in the Himalayas last night.

The couple, who are on a nine day tour of India, checked into the Ananda Spa, a five-star wellness resort located in the tranquil foothills of Himalayan mountains, close to the holy cities of Haridwar and Rishikesh.

The heir to the throne and his wife were given a traditional
welcome and were presented with a garland of Rudraksh Mala beads, which promise the wearer good health and respect.

After the welcome, Prince Charles and Camilla relaxed in the spa hotel's tea lounge and enjoyed a cup of the resort's signature Ananda elixir, 
made from ginger and honey. 

The Royal pair were following in the footsteps of the last 
Viceroy of India and first Governor-General of the independent Dominion 
of India, Lord Mountbatten, the great-uncle of Prince Charles, who stayed at the resort 60 years ago.

Before getting to enjoy the comforts of the hotel, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, like Lord Mountbatten before them, attended a solemn ceremony of thanks held on the banks of the River Ganges.

During the ceremony, which took place in
the nearby city of Rishikesh, the prince led his wife by the hand 
to the banks of the river where they joined Hindu worshippers 
conducting the Aarti ceremony, which is performed every evening by devotees.

Spacious: Villas come with a living room, a pantry for the butler, a dressing room and a huge bathroom

Room with a view: Villas also have private rooftop jaccuzzis and views over the Ganges

Nature:  The spa prides itself on being a retreat that will leave you breathless with glee at the surroundings

Tea lounge: The main reception area is dotted with paintings featuring long-dead royals and potentates

Afterwards, the couple retired to a private Himalaya Villa in the
restored Viceregal Palace, which costs £1026 for a three night stay, and is part of the Ananda resort complex.

The
villa, situated in the middle of a grove of Sal trees, overlooks the 
forest and valley, and comes complete with a sitting room, a pantry for 
the butler, a dressing room and a huge bathroom featuring a private 
sauna with an unhampered view of the swimming pool.

The 40 square metre private pools are surrounded with a deck area equipped with comfortable lounge beds.

Before the royal couple retired for the 
evening, they were presented with personalised sets of the resort's signature kurta pyjamas.

Nikhil Kapur, General Manager of Ananda in the Himalayas, commented: 'The Viceregal Palace at Ananda is a beautiful reminder of the British royalty and it makes for a befitting setting for welcoming Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla.

'We and my entire team are honoured and excited to make their stay a truly memorable one and hopefully have them come again and stay with us.'

Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla are in Uttarakhand to visit three world renowned institutions in Dehradun.

Among them are the Indian Military Academy, the Forest Research Institute and the Doon School, which helps local women finance their own self-employment projects.
