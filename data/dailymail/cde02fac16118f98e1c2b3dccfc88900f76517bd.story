President George W. Bush announced on Saturday that his Scottish Terrier Miss Beazley has died.

Bush shared the news on Instagram along with a photo of him snuggling with her in the Oval Office. Miss Beazley was nine.

'This weekend our beloved dog, Miss Beazley, was put to rest after a battle with lymphoma,' he wrote. 'She was a source of joy during our time in Washington and in Dallas. She was a close companion to her blood relative, Barney.'

'And even though he received all the attention, Beazley never held a grudge against him,' he added. 'She was a guardian to our cats, Bob and Bernadette, who -- like @laurawbush and I -- will miss her.'

Miss Beazley was born on October 28, 2004, according to her White House bio page under the Bush Administration, which also said she enjoyed cheeseburgers and tap dancing.

Miss Beazley was a birthday present for Laura Bush from her husband.

Both Barney and Miss Beazley were featured in a 2005 White House video called 'A Very Beazley Christmas.'

Her uncle Barney died in 2013 after fighting lymphoma as well, Bush said in a statement at the time.

'Barney
 was by my side during our eight years in the White House,' he wrote. 
'He never discussed politics and was always a faithful friend.'

Barney also had his own White House page and was filmed in a series of videos called 'Barney Cams' which have been archived by the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum.

Bush said that Russian President Vladimir Putin disapproved of Barney when he shared a painting of Barney he completed on The Tonight Show in November 2013.

'I introduced Barney to Putin,' he said, 'and he kind of dissed him.'

'His body language said "That's not really a dog,"' he added. He explained that Putin showed him his own pet hound a year later - whom he described as 'bigger and stronger and faster than Barney.'
