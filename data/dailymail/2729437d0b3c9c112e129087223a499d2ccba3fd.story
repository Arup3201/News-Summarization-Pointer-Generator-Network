Stoke paid a nice tribute to Newcastle’s cancer-suffering winger Jonas Gutierrez in their matchday programme. But they also had a little bit of mischievous fun, bizarrely quoting Newcastle’s odds to win the Premier League – an outlandish 5,000-1. They did not, however, mention that they themselves are 2,500-1! It’s fair to say that quoting the odds on relegation would have been a little more relevant. Incidentally, Stoke are 9-1 for the drop while Newcastle are as short as 4-1.

Newcastle’s Cheick Tiote was revealed as having two wives and a mistress on Monday morning. The midfielder was only rumbled when his mistress found out about his second marriage, for he had promised to marry her as well. Ironically, it was also on Monday that manager Alan Pardew revealed his love for the Ivorian on the pages of Sportsmail, saying: ‘I love him. I just love that he’s a winner’. Mr Tiote, it seems, is a man in demand.

The Magpies wore their garish new third kit for the first time, a pea green and navy design which was unveiled earlier this month. Quite why they need a third kit is beyond most supporters and only one of the 2,500 in the away end could be seen sporting the jersey. Their previous ‘blue and green’ kit was worn for just one match in the mid Nineties. That, however, brought them a little more luck, Andy Cole scoring the only goal at Sheffield Wednesday on that occasion.

United owner Mike Ashley was last heard outside of a London pub saying Pardew was ‘dead, finished and over’ if the team were beaten here at Stoke. Well, the billionaire was in attendance and he arrived in a chauffeur-driven people carrier before being shielded from the rain by a Stoke official as he entered the stadium. Dressed in his trademark black-and-white tie and white shirt, Ashley stopped to sign autographs, to which one fan hollered, ‘Are you signing a cheque, Mike?’. If his club remains in and around the relegation zone then he may well be forced to open his cheque book for real come January.
