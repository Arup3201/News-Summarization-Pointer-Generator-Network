Nestle Japan has introduced an oven bake version of its famous Kit Kat bar, with restaurants in the country quick to use the two-finger chocolate snack in new pizza recipes.

The confectionery giant's Japanese wing introduced the bake-ready version earlier this month, with the new Kit Kat eaten either 'raw' or turned into a hard biscuit-like snack by cooking for two minutes.

With the new Kit Kat hugely popular from the off, several pizza and cafe chains in Japan have already taken to using them as a sweet twist in otherwise savoury dishes.

New look: Nestle Japan worked with Japanese confectioner Takagi to produce a bar that can be oven baked

Nestle Japan introduced the KitKat Bake on March 24 under the slogan 'Have a bake, have a Kit Kat'.

The company worked with Japanese confectioner Takagi to produce a bar that can be cooked in the oven, transforming the snack from a slightly unappetising looking pale stick into a crispy double-fingered biscuit in just two minutes.

Some of the first businesses to take advantage of the new treat were pizza chains Napoli no Kama and Strawberry Cones, who sought permission from Nestle to use Kit Kat Bakes in their recipes.

It is thought the idea is to create a kind of 'desert pizza' that perfectly balances the heavily salted flavour of the cheese popular on Japanese pizzas with sweet and crunchy Kit Kat Bakes.

According to Rocket News 24, Napoli no Kama started selling the first Kit Kat pizzas on Friday at 1,630 Yen for a medium size.Â

This isn't the first time Nestle has worked with Takagi on a Kit Kat product.

In January it was revealed that the companies were jointly launching a 'Kit Kat boutique' - a Tokyo store that sells weird and wonderful versions of the snack that can't be purchased anywhere else.

Among the varieties launched to cater for Japanese tastes were Sublime Bitter, Special Sakura Green Tea and Special Chilli.

The Japanese market already has a number of popular Kit Kat flavours that can't be found elsewhere, including Purple Potato, Cinnamon Cookie, European Cheese, Bean Cake and Wasabi

Kit Kats are one of the most popular chocolate bars in the world, with one consumed every second on average.

In Japan, however, the chocolate snack has taken on a whole new level of popularity, massively outselling every other bar for the last two years.
