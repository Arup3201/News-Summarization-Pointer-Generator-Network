100th: One in seven women who is currently 65 will live beyond her 100th birthday

One in seven women who is currently 65 will live beyond her 100th birthday, official figures have revealed.

The report, published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), also claimed that girls who are born in 2057 could potentially live to an average age of 116.

Out of the 374,000 men and 393,000 women aged 65 this year, around 8 per cent of men and 14 per cent of women are expected to reach 100.

But the ONS has predicted that 30 per cent of boys and 39 per cent of girls born in 2013 will live to 100.

And incredibly, they said a generation of girls born in 2057 could have an average life expectancy of 116 if all the most optimistic health forecasts prove to be correct – although they admitted the prediction should be treated ‘with caution’.

The ONS report said there are currently 14,000 people in the UK who are 100 or over, compared to just 600 in 1961.

Charity Age UK called the figure, which has been steadily rising, ‘almost beyond belief’.

The ONS figures also revealed that in 2012/13, the most recent tax year, the State pension and other payouts including pension credit cost the Government £94billion. However by 2062/63, they predicted that the bill could rocket to £438billion, a cost which the Government plans to cope with by increasing the State pension age.

Rising life expectancy rates have already had a significant impact on the age the Government will be able to let people stop working and start claiming their pension. 

At the moment, a woman can claim her State pension from the age of 61 and nine months while a man’s State pension is paid from 65.

However the Chancellor has announced that both sexes will reach a pension age of 68 in the ‘mid-2030s’ – which will rise again to 69 by the ‘late 2040s’. Malcolm McLean, from pension advisers Barnett Waddingham, said: ‘The ONS’s report is a stark reminder of the social and economic challenges the UK faces in dealing with the problems of an ageing society in the years ahead.

‘In terms of pension policy, we appear to have woken up rather late in the day to the need to try to address the ever-growing savings gap, and with it the likelihood of an impoverished old age for potentially millions of people in later life.’

Pensions minister Steve Webb said: ‘The age we get our State pension has to reflect rises in longevity to make sure our system remains fair and affordable for future generations.’
