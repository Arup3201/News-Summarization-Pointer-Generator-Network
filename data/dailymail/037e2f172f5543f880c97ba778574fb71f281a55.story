Wayne Rooney made it clear he remains determined to quit Manchester United after an incredible snub at Sir Alex Ferguson’s final home game yesterday.

Ferguson confirmed Sportsmail’s story that Rooney wants to leave and also indicated he had asked not to be in the squad for yesterday’s 2-1 win over Swansea.

‘I don’t think Wayne was keen to play simply because he’s asked for a transfer,’ Ferguson said.

Despite the claims made by the 
outgoing United manager, Rooney trained as normal all last week and was 
with the rest of the squad at the Lowry Hotel yesterday morning.

Rooney demanded a transfer in showdown
 talks with Ferguson just over two weeks ago and wants a summer move to 
Chelsea after nine years at United.

Minutes after he lifted the Premier 
League trophy and the players, including Rooney, received their medals, 
Ferguson revealed his striker’s desire to move, adding: ‘He wants to 
think it through in his mind.

‘I think that’s a good idea. We’re not
 going to let him go. I think maybe he’s a little frustrated at being 
taken off once or twice in the last few weeks.’

Rooney, who has two years left on his 
£250,000-a-week deal, was not even on the substitutes’ bench as fans 
gave Ferguson a tremendous send-off.

Instead, he watched from an executive 
box and joined team-mates to celebrate United’s 13th Premier League 
title at the final whistle.

The striker and Ferguson barely 
acknowledged each other when Rooney — jeered by some United fans when he
 got on to the field — walked up to receive his medal.

Although incoming United manager David
 Moyes intends to speak to Rooney when he takes over, Ferguson 
has an influential position on the club’s board next season.

All smiles: But will Rooney remain at United after demanding a transfer away from the club?

As Sportsmail revealed last week, Jose
 Mourinho, who is set to be the new Chelsea manager, is anxious to bring
 Rooney to Stamford Bridge and is willing to pay £25million for him. 
Rooney, 27, who lost his guaranteed starting place when Robin van Persie
 arrived from Arsenal, wants to leave United after making just 22 starts
 in the league this season and playing in six different positions.

Rooney will be named in Roy Hodgson’s 
England squad on Thursday for friendlies against the Republic of Ireland
 on May 29 at Wembley and Brazil in  Rio on June 2.

Former United defender and England 
coach Gary Neville, who was at Old Trafford yesterday, intends to have 
talks with Rooney when he reports for international duty.

Speaking in his role as an analyst for
 Sky Sports, Neville said:  ‘He (Rooney) is an emotional lad and he 
needs to consider what he’s done.

Speculation: Wayne Rooney could be leaving United this summer, with Chelsea and PSG ready to pounce

‘He’s 27 and there’s nowhere to go. 
I’ve seen players join Real Madrid and they want to come back. He loves 
football, the players will look after him. He’s been vacant on the pitch
 recently and he’s not been himself.

‘He’s sat up there in that box watching the game, but he needs to surround himself with friends and family.

‘This is a good kid. He’s not rash, 
just emotional. These players have massive egos. When they don’t play 
against Real Madrid in the Champions League they get down, but they have
 to deal with adversity.

‘There is an international break coming and that will be an important time for him to enjoy his football again.’
