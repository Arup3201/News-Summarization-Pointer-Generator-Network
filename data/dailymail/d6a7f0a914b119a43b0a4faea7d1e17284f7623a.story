Jeremy Lin says racism may have played a role in the reaction to his rise to fame in New York, as he hopes to keep Linsanity alive in a different jersey - since he was cast out of the city he loves.

The Houston Rockets point guard, who became one of the Big Apple's biggest stars during his time with the Knicks last year, is opening up about his journey from Harvard to Madison Square Garden to Houston - and the couches in between.

Last year, Lin, the NBA's first American-born player of Taiwanese or Chinese descent,said he may have been headed to Europe if he had not been given a chance with the Knicks.

Speaking to GQ magazine, Lin claimed that race had a lot to do with why his sudden fame.

He said: 'There’s a lot of perceptions and stereotypes of Asian-Americans that are out there today, and the fact that I’m Asian-American makes it harder to believe, even crazier, more unexpected.

'I’m going to have to play well for a longer period of time for certain people to believe it, because I’m Asian. And that’s just the reality of it.'

Lin joined the Houston Rockets in July after the Knicks announced that they would not match the Rockets' three-year, $25million offer for the restricted free agent.

But for a man about to begin a new chapter in his NBA career, there is still a great amount of sadness about leaving New York and its basketball fans.

Lin told GQ: 'You can't ask for a city or a fan base to embrace somebody more than they embraced me. I know it's kind of silly to talk about it with only two years under my belt in the league, but going in before free agency, I was like, "I want to play in front of these fans for the rest of my career." I really did.

'I really wanted to play in front of the Madison Square Garden fans for the rest of my career, because they’re just unbelievable.'

The 23-year-old point guard, undrafted out of Harvard, became an international phenomenon and the biggest story in sports during just one dazzling month in the Big Apple.

But the Knicks ultimately decided that the Linsanity fan frenzy was too big for the team's wallet.

Lin proved to be much more than just a one-hit wonder in New York - he had 28 and 23 points in his first two NBA starts, and then scored a career-high 38 in a 92-85 victory over Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers.

The stock price for Madison Square Garden Inc. surged on the production and popularity of the team's international star.

He also made the Sports Illustrated cover in consecutive weeks, only the 12th athlete to hold that distinction since 1990.

It won't be the first time Lin has 
donned a Rockets jersey. He played with the team for a total of two 
preseason games last year before he was placed on waivers and later 
claimed by the Knicks.

The 23-year-old point guard, undrafted out of Harvard, became an international phenomenon and the biggest story in sports during just one dazzling month in the Big Apple.

But the Knicks ultimately decided that the Linsanity fan frenzy was too big for the team's wallet.

Rockets general manager Daryl Morey celebrated the re-acquisition on Twitter, saying: 'Welcome to Houston (at)JLin7. We plan to hang on this time. You will love (hash)RedNation.'

The Rockets actually waived Lin after two weeks in their training camp in December. Team owner Leslie Alexander said in a statement in July that the team was 'thrilled to have Jeremy back.'

The Knicks said they would match any offer to retain Lin, but the Rockets made it tough for New York to keep him by backloading their offer sheet with a $15 million salary in the third season. If the Knicks agreed to that deal, they would've faced a hefty luxury tax in 2014-15 because of other big contracts on their books - between $30-40 million.

One sports consultant said the adjustment to the offer sheet was a stroke of genius by Rockets GM Daryl Morey.

'The Rockets deserve a lot of credit for the way they've gone about this,' said Marc Ganis, president of Chicago-based SportsCorp. 'It was extremely intelligent - with an assassin's touch.'

But Houston made the bad move, initially, waiving Lin because it already had Goran Dragic and Kyle Lowry on the roster.

The Knicks picked him up and gave him first real shot. He was briefly demoted to the developmental league, recalled and finally got his chance when coach Mike D'Antoni put him in with the Knicks floundering at 8-15. Lin scored a career-high 25 points in a 99-92 win over New Jersey Nets and 'Linsanity' was born.

Lin had slept on teammate Landry Fields' couch the night before, still refusing to get his own place as he headed into that week, knowing the Knicks would have to decide whether to cut him or guarantee his contract for the rest of the season.
