A woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by an Air Force combat pilot says she is 'absolutely stunned' after a top military commander reversed a conviction against her alleged assailant.

Air Force Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin reversed a jury's sexual assault conviction against Lt. Col. James Wilkerson after reviewing the case over a three-week period and concluding 'that the entire body of evidence was insufficient to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.'  Wilkerson had been sentenced to one year in prison and he was dismissed from the service.

'I was absolutely stunned,' victim Kimberly Hanks told NBC's TODAY Show, describing the moment that she learned of the reversal. 'It looks to me like [Franklin] is protecting one of his own.'

Describing the night of the alleged assault, Hanks told NBC's TODAY Show that she was sleeping in Wilkerson's guest bedroom after a night of socializing at his house with friends and she 'felt some discomfort.'

'The lights came on, which woke me up, and I opened my eyes and he ws in bed with me with his hands down my pants,' she said.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is now reviewing the reversal, along with the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Hagel said that under military law, neither he nor the Air Force secretary has the authority to reverse Franklin's decision to overturn the November conviction against Wilkerson, a former inspector general at Aviano Air Base in Italy.

The Senate Armed Services Committee is holding a hearing Wednesday on sexual assaults in the military and the Wilkerson case is expected to be a major topic of discussion.

Second look: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says he will reexamine a case involving an Air Force general who dismissed charges against a lieutenant colonel convicted of sexual assault

There were nearly 800 reports of sexual assault cases in the Air Force last year, ranging from inappropriate touching to rape.

That is a nearly 30 per cent increase from 2011, when 614 cases were reported.

Many of those cases stem from a single base near San Antonio where dozens of young female recruits and airmen were victimized by their instructors. 

An inquiry into Lackland Air Force Base found that 32 military training instructors allegedly engaged in inappropriate or coercive sexual relationships with 59 recruits and airmen at Lackland, according to the Air Force. 

Six instructors have been convicted in courts-martial on charges ranging from adultery, rape and conducting unprofessional relationships. Nine more instructors are awaiting courts-martial. Two more received nonjudicial punishments. Fifteen 15 instructors remain under investigation.

Boxer and Sen Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, wrote to Hagel last week asking him to look into the case.

They called Franklin's decision to overturn the jury verdict 'a travesty of justice.'

Franklin is commander of the 3rd Air Force at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

Sen Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, 
told Air Force Secretary Michael Donley and Gen Mark Welsh, the Air 
Force chief of staff, in a March 5 letter that Franklin's decision 
'shows ignorance, at best, and malfeasance, at worst.'

Franklin's decision undermines 
efforts by the Air Force and the other military branches 'to erase a 
culture that has often turned a blind eye on sexual assault,' McCaskill 
added.

Shaheen and McCaskill are members of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

The Air Force has been grappling for months with the fallout over a sex scandal at its training headquarters in Texas.

Dozens of young female recruits and 
airmen at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio were victimized by 
their instructors who sexually harassed, improperly touched or raped 
them.

During January testimony before a 
House committee, Welsh likened sexual assault in the Air Force's ranks 
to a cancer and vowed to tackle the problem by screening personnel more 
carefully and putting an end to bad behaviors like binge drinking that 
can lead to misconduct.

But Welsh also acknowledged that the 
Air Force recorded a disturbing number of reports of sexual assault last
year even as it worked to curb misconduct.

Wilkerson is a former inspector general at Aviano Air Base in Italy before he was convicted of aggravated sexual assault, a conviction that was later overturned

The preliminary figures for 2012 show 
there were nearly 800 reports of cases, ranging from inappropriate 
touching to rape, according to Welsh.

Time for a change: Rep Jackie Speier is looking to propose legislation that would strip commanders of authority to block decisions made by courts-martial

That would be a nearly 30 per cent increase from 2011, when 614 cases were reported.

The 2012 figures are being audited and will be included in a report the Defense Department will submit to Congress next month.

In his letter to Boxer, Hagel refers 
to Franklin as the 'convening authority,' a term for a commander who is 
responsible for establishing a court-martial.

The Uniform Code of Military Justice 
gives a convening authority the 'sole discretion' to reduce or set aside
guilty verdicts and sentences, or to reverse a jury's verdict.

Wilkerson was convicted on November 2 
by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated 
sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer 
and a gentleman.

Hagel said he has directed the 
Pentagon's general counsel and the Air Force secretary to examine 
Franklin's decision 'to determine how the factual basis for the action 
can be made more transparent.'

Hagel also said the Wilkerson case 
raises the question of whether it is necessary or appropriate 'to place 
the convening authority in the position of having the responsibility to 
review the findings and sentence of a court-martial,' particularly when 
military law allows for a rigorous appeal process.

He said he is ordering the Air Force 
and other military services to examine that question and determine if 
changes to military law are necessary.
