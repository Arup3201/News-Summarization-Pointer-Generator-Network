Fernando Torres is back home. He has returned to Atletico Madrid in a bid to rediscover his form and he certainly wasn't short of endeavour during his second debut for the club where it all started for the Spaniard.

Having signed on loan from AC Milan until the end of the season, Torres was thrust straight into the Atleti starting line-up as he started the 2-0 victory over bitter rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the last-16  Copa del Rey tie.

The 30-year-old returned an impressive 91 goals from 244 appearances during his first spell at Atletico between 2001 and 2007 before moving to Liverpool. Here, Sportsmail runs through Torres' involvement during his first match back at the Vicente Calderon...

5th minute: Torres is involved in the game for the first time and is flagged offside - rightly, as he was marginally ahead of Sergio Ramos - before trying to lob the on-rushing Keylor Navas in the Real goal. The chip, from the edge of the area, sails harmlessly wide but Torres' movement is impressive.

6th minute: The former Chelsea forward has put himself about in the early stages but, unfortunately for him, he has been just a little bit over-eager. He ends up giving away two fouls for mis-timed challenges.

10th minute: This time Torres is miles offside but he slowly jogs towards the ball with the Real defence motionless as the linesman takes an age to lift up his flag.

12th minute: Torres gives away another foul as Ramos tries to run for the ball but the Atleti striker catches his Spain team-mate's heels and brings him down.

17th minute: After picking the ball up on the right-hand side of the box, Torres weaves in and out of a couple of Real defenders before having a shot blocked. That' his first sight of goal - well, when he's been onside anyway...

21st minute: The striker defends a Real corner well and blasts it clear.

23rd minute: As Antoine Griezmann advances with the ball, Torres makes a run in behind the Real defence but his French team-mate cannot find him. The Spaniard throws his arm down in frustration. He then runs deep into his own half, challenges well and advances into the Real half before being tackled by Marcelo. Torres is not happy about the challenge, but the referee waves away his protests.

28th minute: Again Torres is caught offside. He is returning from an offside position but cannot get back onside before Raul Garcia's header reaches him.

30th minute: Torres is still putting himself about and he jumps to compete for the ball with Sami Khedira. A flailing arm sees him catch the German midfielder and he gives a foul away. Khedira responds in kind by pushing his arm intro Torres' face when the Spaniard tries to get round him 30 seconds later and the Real midfielder is cautioned as a result.

41st minute: James Rodriguez sends in a corner for Real and Torres expertly heads clear to avert any danger.

42nd minute: Marcelo wins the ball off Torres who gives the Brazilian a small touch in the back. He falls to the floor and Torres is penalised. It's soft but it probably is a foul. Torres himself is then fouled by Alvaro Arbeloa, with the Spaniard also going down very easily.

50th minute: Torres backs into Ramos on the right wing and a free-kick is given in the Spaniard's favour as he is brought to the ground.

51st minute: The striker leaps well in the middle of the pitch to get a little flick on to strike partner Griezmann, but the Frenchman's shot is high and wide.

56th minute: Great use of his body and brilliant strength from Torres sees Atletico break down the right and it eventually creates a chance for Griezmann.

59th minute: Torres is clapped off the pitch and then given a congratulatory slap on the back by coach Diego Simeone as he is replaced by Koke. An industrious performance by Torres but he was caught offside far too regularly and was unable to muster a real chance of note all night. He will hope that a return to full fitness over the coming weeks will enable him to rediscover his best form. On the basis of this match though, that could be a long time coming...

The result saw Torres finish on the winning side against Real as an Atletico player for the first time.

Speaking after the game, he said: 'There was plenty to celebrate. The atmosphere was great and so was the performance but we know that taking a 2-0 to the Bernabeu is not enough to mean the tie is over.

'We will have to play just as well there to finish the job.'
