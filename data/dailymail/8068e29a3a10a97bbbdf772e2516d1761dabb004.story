Charged: Betty Basham, 34, has been charged with three counts of child abuse resulting in injury after allegedly using a stun gun on her children

A West Virginia mother was charged with three counts of child abuse on Tuesday after allegedly using a stun gun to discipline her three children.

Betty Basham, 34, was taken into custody afterÂ  teachers noticed her oldest boy had a wound on his leg that resembled a 'bee sting'.

Deputies said that in a subsequent investigation by Child Protective Services her child said that on New Years Eve, Basham punished all three of her kids using an electric shock stun gun.

'It's a 3- to 5-second burst,' Sheriff Steve Deweese said. 'It's very painful.'

Deweese also made the unsettling claim that being stunned is as painful as 100 bee stings for a child.

According to the criminal complaint filed in Putnam County, the boy said that he and his brothers would be 'whipped' by Basham on a daily basis according to WSAZ.Com.

The day before the boy spoke with investigators he claimed he was 'whipped' so hard he had trouble sitting down.

Basham was not answering any telephone calls at her home on Tuesday but it is known that the children have left and are staying with a relatives.

Sheriff Deweese said that Basham has no history of child abuse but has faced multiple drug charges in the past.
