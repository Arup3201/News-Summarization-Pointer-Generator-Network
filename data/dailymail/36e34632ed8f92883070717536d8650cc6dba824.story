Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted into the NFL, has become engaged to his boyfriend and college sweetheart Vito Cammisano during a romantic trip to Europe, according to reports.

The couple - who met as students at the University of Missouri, where they were both standout athletes - traveled to Spain for New Years before traveling on to Italy, where the proposal appears to have occurred.

TMZ are reporting that a friend of 23-year-old Cammisano announced the pair's engagement on Twitter, congratulating the two on their decision to be married, and that Sam liked the post. 

The announcement coincided with Sam's 25th birthday and, according to his social media, he spent the day with Cammisano in Rome.

At Christmas, Sam also posted a photo to his Instagram of a ring, where he thanked his boyfriend for 'a great Christmas gift' 

They had to comment on the reported engagement.

The couple met when Sam was a freshman at Mizzou, during one of his first college parties. 

It was a lingerie party and Cammisano was dressed as a rabbit, complete with a tail, which Sam told Out magazine he remembered because Cammisano - a star swimmer from 2009 to 2012 - was drunkenly vomiting over a railing from a second-story deck.

'I went up to him to ask if he was OK, and he started cursing at me, screaming, ''F--- off — do you know who I am?'' ' Sam told the mag.

'I told him I didn't care who he was. We didn't speak again for two years.'

When Cammisano came out to his swim team in 2011, they started dating, however it was secret, because Sam was closeted.

'Early on, it was awesome,' Sam said during a recent documentary on his life produced by the OWN network.

'And then bad things started to happen.' 

'When Vito came to my house, he had to sneak through in and out of the window. 

'Vito was getting really tired of that.'

The pair broke up for a few months, until the holidays, when Cammisano realized Sam didn't have anywhere for Christmas.

'So Mickey came to Kansas City for Christmas and that's when (we realized) we missed this,' Cammisano said in the doco. 

'It really was Christmas that brought us back together.'

Controversial: Many viewers erupted in anger after a televised kiss was shown on ESPN in May as Sam was drafted by the St. Louis Rams

The pair have been together since, but were not captured in public together until earlier this year.

They hit international headlines in May, when Sam - who  had come out in February - made history as the first openly gay NFL draft pick.

The moment he was told he had been drafted by the St. Louis Rams was televised live on ESPN, and an emotional Sam kissed Cammisano in celebration.

The unprecedented moment was met with reactions of joy by most but dismay, anger and even hate by others.

Some online postings deplored the kiss as inappropriate for family viewing.

Sam and Cammisano shared another public kiss last month when Sam accepted a GQ Man of the Year award.

Sam recently told Oprah Winfrey that while the aftermath of the moment was surprising, he would do it again.

'Absolutely. I came out so I wouldn't have to hide myself,' he said in the interview.

'That was me. What you saw was me. It wasn't staged. I was very emotional. 

'And when I got that phone call it was one of the happiest moments of my life. 

'It was three long days, coming close to the end of that, almost not being drafted. 

'I wanted to share a moment with the one who had spent the same three days, I wanted to share a moment with him. 

'I'm not a pretender anymore.'

Sam was cut from the St. Louis Rams and then, in October, was dropped by the Dallas Cowboys. 

'While this is disappointing, I will take the lessons I learned here in Dallas and continue to fight for an opportunity to prove that I can play every Sunday,' he wrote on Twitter at the time.
