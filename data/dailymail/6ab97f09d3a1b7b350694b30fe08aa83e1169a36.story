Neymar lit up the World Cup in Brazil and La Liga for Barcelona in 2014 and now we know where he gets his skill from.

The Barca star's dad can be seen performing keep-ups with a football in a video clip... while sat down.

In the video, posted on Instagram by his son, Neymar Snr is sat down on gym apparatus before he throws a football up in the air and starts kicking the ball with his foot.
