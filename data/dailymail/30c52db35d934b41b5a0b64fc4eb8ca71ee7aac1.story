Four top music students pursuing studies in piano, voice and violin at a prestigious conservatory have been arrested for leading double lives in which they allegedly ran drug labs to make Ecstasy.

Benjamin Knight, 24, Lauren Pajerski, 22, Max Cickovskis, 22, and Jonathan Beckwith, 23, have been indicted on numerous charges after their clandestine operation was uncovered at Baldwin Wallace University Conservatory of Music in Berea, Ohio.

The arrests came after a six-month 
investigation by police officers during which they discovered reams of 
text messages between the classmates as they planned their operation.

'I am just grateful nothing blew up and 
no one got hurt,' Berea police Detective Dennis Bort told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 'The moral of this 
case is book-smart, street-stupid.'

Caught: Benjamin Knight, 24, (left) and Jonathan Beckwith, 23, (right) were also arrested for the plot

It is a steep fall from grace for the promising musicians.

Knight, from Madison, Ohio and Beckwith, from Oakley, Michigan, were among 12 keyboard students who received scholarships this 
year, the Plain Dealer reported.

Cickovskis, from Parma, Ohio, sang bass and is pictured playing guitar on Facebook, while Pajerski, a violin major from Andover, Massachusetts, played in 
the 2012 Bach Festival in April.

Police first launched an investigation into the students on May 17 after a university chemistry teacher found his key to the science labs had been stolen.

He told officers he had seen Pajerski, who also majored in chemistry, looking in the room with another man earlier that day, which he thought was unusual as it was the summer vacation.

Despite changing the locks, security guards spotted a man and woman, dressed in black and wearing face masks, in the lab at 11.30pm the next night.

'They had boxed up chemicals and 
equipment and had other lab equipment running,' Bort said. 'When [the 
security guard] walked in, they ran out.'

The pair were later identified by police as Pajerski and Knight, who ran to a university hall of residence to hide from police, where they bumped into Beckwith.

They told him about the break in and he helped them set up a lab in an empty dorm room to cook a batch of Ecstasy, police said.

Police approached phone service providers to obtain the students' text messages and learned that they texted each other about specific chemicals and equipment, the Plain Dealer reported.

Knight and Pajerski sent messages planning the break-in, what equipment they 
needed and how Pajerski should leave a window open on the ground floor to get inside, Bort said.

'Some of the messages were pretty 
funny,' he added. 'He said he had a really sweet hat for [the break-in]
and she said a fedora is not B-and-E [breaking and entering] wear.'

Foiled: The investigation was launched after Pajerski, left, and Knight, right, allegedly stole equipment to make the drugs from a chemistry lab. Police also tracked their text messages planning the break-in

The text messages allegedly revealed that the students cooked drugs in Knight's garage, the same dorm room at Findley Hall and at a condominium, all within two weeks in June.

Police swooped on the students' home in Berea on October 19 and left with chemicals and equipment used to make hallucinogenic mushrooms and Ecstasy.

'They were fairly diversified,' Bort 
said. 'She had the technical knowledge to set it up, and Ben handled the
logistics of acquiring. Max seems to be more sales-oriented.'

He added that Knight, Pajerski and Cickovskis did not 
appear to understand the seriousness of the potential charges - and one asked when they would get their computers back so they could finish their thesis.

'They didn't understand
they were not likely getting it back nor were they likely to be in 
school,' Bort said.

Investigations continue into who was buying the drugs, police said. All four students have been suspended from the university.

They were indicted on November 16 on charges including assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs and cultivating marijuana. Knight and Pajerski were charged with theft and burglary.

They are scheduled to be arraigned on December 4 and if convicted, they could face mandatory prison time due to their proximity to Berea High School and a nearby elementary school.

Baldwin Wallace Conservatory of Music is 15 miles southwest of Cleveland, Ohio.

It has places for just 260 students and programs have produced successful musicians, including members of the Cleveland Orchestra and composers, such as Anthony Holland.
