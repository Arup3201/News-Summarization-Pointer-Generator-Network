A Republican activist charged with 
raping five women has apparently committed suicide at the Utah cabin 
where the crimes are alleged to have taken place.

Two bail bond agents were dispatched 
to the remote log cabin in Heber yesterday to check on Gregory Nathan Peterson because his 
ankle monitor was not responding, Wasatch County Sheriff Todd Bonner 
said.

Peterson, 37, who had been out on bail 
since October 19 on multiple charges of rape, assault and kidnapping -
 was to stand trial on 23 felony charges and two misdemeanor counts.

The men found Peterson's body in an upstairs bedroom, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Chief Deputy Jared Rigby confirmed that Peterson was found with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

A medical examiner's final determination on a cause of death will come after an autopsy on today.

Peterson's attorney had been trying to contact him but he was not responding, Sheriff Bonner said. He said he did not know if Peterson had left behind a suicide note.

Four women from Salt Lake County and 
one from Wasatch County testified at a hearing in August that Peterson 
sexually assaulted them at his cabin.

The women said Peterson fondled them over their clothing without consent. He is accused of meeting them on Mormon dating websites and at church functions.

Two of the women said they had met Peterson on Mormon dating website LDSsingles.com.

One woman had arranged a date with him - claiming heÂ  looked like 'a great catch' in his 
profile and had come recommended by a Mormon temple.

Peterson, a certified public 
accountant and the owner of Peterson Wealth Management, has been a 
fixture at Utah Republican gatherings.

He helped organize the Rocky Mountain Conservatives Convention and Barbecue two years ago at the cabin.

Prominent Utah politicians hosted by 
Peterson included Senator Orrin Hatch, Governor Gary Herbert, 
Representative Jason Chaffetz and congressional candidate Mia Love.

While Peterson has been involved in 
state politics and events, Utah Republican Chairman Thomas Wright has 
said he never held a leadership role or raised or donated money for the 
state party.

Some considered Peterson a self-styled tea party operative.
