London's drugs gangs are expanding their operations into the Home Counties and fuelling a rise in violence previously seen only in the capital, experts warn.

Simon Harding, a criminologist at Middlesex University, said gangsters were recruiting teenage girls and boys to create crack and heroin supply lines to towns including Cambridge, Scarborough and Derby.

And when two gangs decide to set up shop in the same small town it was leading to an escalation of violence as dealers fight for control of the new territory, he said.

The warning comes after a series of raids in September targeting a criminal network allegedly trafficking boys and girls to rural parishes and towns in Kent and Hampshire to ferry drugs.

Around 250 officers swooped on eight members of a Lewisham gang suspected of recruiting children as young as 14 directly from south London schools and youth clubs.

Canterbury, Aylesham, Folkestone, and Portsmouth were among the areas where raids took place. 

Scotland Yard identified more than 250 gangs operating in the capital last year, which has been cut by a third, with nearly 900 members jailed and another 200 subject to other measures including antisocial behaviour orders.

Although many of London’s gangs are territorial, based on postcodes and estates, the crackdown led to a spike in offences being committed outside the capital as groups spread into new potentially lucrative areas.

Dr Harding told The Times children are finding themselves in a 'Dickensian world' where gangs sent girls to scope out rural areas before sending boys to set up drugs supply lines with an established contact.

'Gangs can even put a deposit down on a flat in these small towns so these teenagers live and operate out of them,' he said.

'When you have two gangs deciding to operate in the same area, you will start to see an escalation of violence.'

Junior Smart, an ex-offender turned gang expert with the St Giles Trust, said previously localised London gangs were expanding to 'any town you can think of'.

He said: 'The first sign a drugs line has been embedded is the rise in acquisitive crime such as theft, shoplifting and burglary.

'This is often done by those buying the drugs and needing cash to feed the habit.'

In the six months up to September, 15 boys and girls aged between 15 and 20 were arrested in Kent and Hampshire carrying up to 200 rocks of crack cocaine or large amounts of heroin.

Many had been forced to stash the drugs under their clothes as they travelled by train from the gang’s south-east London stronghold to a series of rented houses where they deal on the streets.

Detective Superintendent Tim Champion, of Trident central gangs unit, told the Evening Standard at the time of the raids the gang had 'evolved' to use children.

'The controllers of the network stay in London most of the time and use the young people to take all the risks involved in drug dealing,' he said.

‘It means all the points where they could be intercepted with drugs is taken by these young people.

Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Dennis from Hampshire Constabulary added: ‘We identified that drug gangs from London were sending young people into Portsmouth to deal.

'These young people are themselves victims and we have taken steps to safeguard them and to work with them.’
