Talks: Apple has reportedly held talks with a firm co-owned by hip hop producer Dr Dre (pictured) about setting up a new music streaming service

Apple has held talks with a firm co-founded by hip-hop producer Dr Dre about the creation of a new music streaming service.

The technology giant is reported to have approached Beats 
Electronics, best known for its distinctive headphones, over a potential 
partnership involving Beats' planned music-streaming service.

It would help Apple steal a march on arch-rival Google, which is also believed to be launching a YouTube branded streaming music service this year.

Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook met with music mogul and Beats CEO Jimmy Iovine during a visit to Los Angeles in late February to find out more about Beats' plan, called 'Project Daisy.'

Apple's Internet products chief Eddy Cue, a key player in setting up its iTunes Music Store, also joined the meeting, at which Mr Cook expressed interest in Project Daisy's business model and its rollout plans - although the two did not discuss specifics of a deal, sources said.

The meeting between Mr Cook and Mr Iovine, who is also chairman of music company Interscope-Geffen-A&M, is believed to have been 'informational' and covered a broad range of music-related topics.

Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr and Beats declined to comment.

Apple, which makes the globally successful iPhone, has been widely reported to be considering a music-streaming service to complement iTunes, the largest online repository of music for sale.

Beats, which is known for its stylistic, distinctive headphones, has a partnership with Taiwanese handset maker HTC Corp, an Apple rival.

In a boost for the company, Beats said on Tuesday it had secured $60 million in funding for Daisy from a group of investors including Warner Music owner Len Blavatnik, Fort Worth billionaire Lee M. Bass, and Australian financier James Packer.

The funding will bankroll the music service's launch in late 2013.

Beats reportedly named the project 'Daisy' in honor of what it called the first digital, computerized song.

At the time, the firm said in a press release that the service would 'bring an emotional connection back to the act of music discovery,' referring to the process through which users find, buy and consume music.

The music recording industry has languished through more than a decade of declining revenues. Industry sources say many of the largest companies are beginning to warm to the idea of collecting fees on music streamed over the Internet, as the use of smartphones and tablets increases around the world.

The meeting between Apple and Mr Iovine was set up in January, immediately after Beats announced Daisy without explaining the upcoming project's business model or how it plans to differentiate itself from existing services such as Spotify and Pandora.

Other players reportedly looking at expanding into music-streaming - whether fee-based or by paid subscription - include Google and Amazon.

Negotiations for the Google service have been underway for several months and it will launch later this year, according to reports.

It is expected to be branded as a YouTube service.

They tech giants
biggest rival would be Spotify, the Swedish service which lists five 
million paying subscribers and 20 million users of its ad-supported 
service in 17 countries.

Deezer, Rdio and Spotify all offer a free, ad-supported service alongside a Â£9.99-a-month subscription for premium users.

The area is seen as the future of the music industry, and is expected to have contributed more than ten per cent of the music industry's digital revenue for the first time in 2012, while the number of paying subscribers surged by 44 per cent last year to 20 million people globally.

Mr Iovine, a music producer and 'mentor' to contestants on Fox's 'American Idol' show, has a long association with Apple and was one of the first music industry executives to sign onto what was then Apple's nascent iTunes initiative, announced in 2001.
