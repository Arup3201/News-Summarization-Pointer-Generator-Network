Boston Red Sox player David Ortiz is suing a jewellery dealer who he accuses of ripping him off after selling him fake or low-quality goods.

Ortiz claimed that California jeweller Randy Hamida sold him $127,000 worth of goods which he said were worth considerably less.

The baseball player has filed a civil suit at Middlesex Superior Court in Massachusetts after he failed to secure a refund from the businessman.

Ortiz paid $127,000 for the watch, bracelet and earrings which he alleges were made from inferior materials

Ortiz's laywer Jonathan M Davidoff told the Boston Globe: 'David doesn't buy jewellery, or buy anything from just anybody. He trusted Mr Hamida. This was a last resort for David. David didn't want to sue. But also, David, doesn't want to be taken advantage of. And professional athletes are targets, unfortunately.' 

According to the details of the civil suit, Ortiz bought a Breitling watch with diamonds in white and yellow gold; a diamond bracelet; a set of black diamond earrings; a necklace and a bracelet. 

The lawsuit accuses Hamida of Randy's Mens Wear Ltd of fraud and breach of contract following the 2010 deal.  

According to court papers, Hamida targets professional athletes including Ortiz. 

The Boston Globe said that attempts to contact Hamida were unsuccessful. 

The court documents said that Hamida approached Ortiz in September 2010 in Seattle where they agreed to meet up the following month for to conclude a deal. 

Ortiz agreed to pay $80,000 along with $47,000 worth of his own jewellery to conclude the purchase. 

However, when Ortiz went to get his new jewels appraised, he was told that a number of the items were worth considerably less than he paid for them.
