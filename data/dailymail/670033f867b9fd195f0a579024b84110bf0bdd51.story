Sergio Aguero has given an insight into the crazy world of Mario Balotelli by revealing what it was like playing with the controversial forward at Manchester City between 2011 and 2013. 

In his new book, Born To Rise: My Story, which has been serialised in the Mirror, Aguero explains that there was never a dull moment playing alongside the maverick Italian, especially as the now Liverpool striker had little or no regard for authority.

Aguero wrote: 'He’d say things like, "The police have just followed me all the way to the training ground and want to talk to me," and I’d say, "No wonder! You’ve probably just broken the speed limit or bumped into somebody!"

'Sometimes he’d get a message from reception saying the police wanted to speak to him and he’d say "F*** the police!"

'Then he’d remember that he'd driven past the police pretty quickly. He was always seeking attention.

The Argentine striker also recalled an incident when Balotelli called him out of the blue, only to hang up for no reason.

The Manchester City star explained: 'Last season I was injured and in the stands when we played Barcelona in the Champions League.

My phone went off. I didn’t recognise the number but I answered it and heard, "Hey! It’s Mario! How’s it going d*******? Come on City, come on City!" – and then he just hung up!'
