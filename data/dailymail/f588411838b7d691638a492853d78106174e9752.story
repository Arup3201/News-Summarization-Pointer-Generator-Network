It was almost 500 years ago, during the ongoing land border wars, that a group of Scottish youths captured an English flag from a raiding party.

And to mark the historic occasion, hundreds of horse riders marched, and galloped, through Hawick during the annual Common Riding.

Meanwhile, locals also enjoyed some unusual rituals such as Snuffin' - which saw people shoving each other as they tried to grab snuff which was packed inside a ram's horn.

The event - the first of the Border festivals - not only celebrates the seizing of the flag in 1514 by the young men ('callants') of Hornshole, in the heart of the town, but also the ancient custom of riding the marches, or boundaries, of the common land.

Each of the border towns - including Jedburgh, Melrose, Selkirk and Galashiels - marks its history once a year, from June to August, with magnificent rideouts involving hundreds of horses along the marches. 

In keeping with tradition, the principal rider, known in Hawick as the Cornet, carried the blue flag for the first time in the year. The honour this year went to Chris Ritson.

Holding the 'banner blue', he led his followers in the chase, a 
ride at full gallop, in memory of the victorious youths of 1514. 

Other festivities included fife and drum bands, who played as dignitaries and the cavalcade made their way through town.

During the Snuffin', a man, flanked by two bodyguards, carries the ram's horn filled with snuff - while youths jostle as they try to wrestle free some of the powder

It is believed the tradition stems from when a snuff box was passed around during a break in local meetings. Others reckon it harks back to when troops would receive snuff before going to war

Among the ceremonies is the Colour Bussing, which occurs on the Thursday evening - the 'nicht afore the morn' (ie the last night before the big day).

For many, the Common Riding officially starts at 6pm on that night - when the Drum and Fife Band march round the town to the Town Hall for the Colour-Bussing.

The Hall is filled with Teries, as the locals call themselves, while the balcony is filled with the Cornet's supporters.

After the Provost and magistrates file inside, the women ('lasses') arrive.

The end of the ritual is followed by singing, which concludes with a traditional song, Teribus, from which the Teries derive their name.

Another curious ritual is the Snuffin'.

A man, flanked by two bodyguards, carries a ram's horn filled with snuff - while youths jostle as they try to wrestle free some of the powder.

Afterwards small packets of highly prized snuff are thrown from windows, and pounced upon.

Records of the Common Riding principals go back to 1703.

Saturday events include the laying of the wreaths at the War Memorial, horse racing and professional games. 

The Common Riding concludes with the Cornet returning the flag to the Provost.

Held by the Cornet, the current flag is a copy of the ancient flag which was captured at Hornshole as the original has long been lost

The flag is an important part of the events at the Hawick Common Riding today.

Held by the Cornet, the current flag is a copy of the ancient one which was captured at Hornshole as the original has long been lost.

In 1707, the Town Council noticed that the flag being used had become torn and useless.

However, it still exists and may be seen in the museum at Wilton Lodge.

The flag is blue with a cross of gold ('A Banner Azure with Saltire Or').

It has the date '1514' in gold. The letters 'HC' were added later. They stand for 'Hawick Colour'.

In the late 1800s, studies of past flags showed that the shape of the flag should not be square or rectangular.

It should instead be in the shape of a 'pennon' - which is a long narrow triangular or swallow-tailed flag. This is the shape of the flag used today.

It is believed that the first flag belonged to the Priory at Hexham.

A few years ago, the people in charge of Hexham Abbey asked the Hawick Council for a copy of their flag. This request was granted. The copy they received still hangs on a wall in the abbey.

In the mid-18th century, other flags were carried during the Common Riding. Schools and guilds were represented in the Common Riding procession by mounted standard-bearers.

Arguments, however, arose over which flags should come first. In 1747, the following order was agreed by the Council. First was the Town Flag followed by the Grammar School Flag. Then came the English School flag and lastly the Prentice Colour.

Two years later, the Council decided that in the future there should be only one flag: 'May 26 - the which day the Bailies and Council have unanimously resolved that in time coming no Colour or Standard shall be carried on the Common Riding days except the Town's Colour or Standard.'

This rule was not too strict as the Grammar School flag was still carried till about 1777. Since then, however, only one flag has been carried at the Common Riding.                                                                                                                        Source: Hawick Callants Club
