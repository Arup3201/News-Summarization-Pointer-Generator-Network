He's the proud owner of Britain's biggest mini-bar – but Eddie Hayes has no plans to ever open any of the 2,000 miniature bottles that line its shelves.

For while others would find it hard to resist the exotic collection of beers and spirits, the businessman is teetotal.

Worth £10,000, the haul in his 30ft bar comes from across the globe and includes ouzo from Saddam Hussein-era Iraq and a Medieval mead, all amassed in a labour of love stretching back more than 40 years.

But the company director, 71, has no taste for a tipple. 'I went off alcohol a long time ago,' he said. 'I would never dream of drinking them – think of the hangover.

'I might have the odd lager shandy but that's all. So my collection is safe.'

Mr Hayes, of Newport, South Wales, started his collection when he was given some miniatures as a present. He then kept bottles from business trips and holidays with wife Jean, 64, as mementos.

As his collection grew, friends and family added to it – forcing him to buy new shelves.
