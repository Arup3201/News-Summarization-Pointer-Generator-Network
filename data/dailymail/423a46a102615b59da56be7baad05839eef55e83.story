Horrified Christmas shoppers and staff fled as the gang brazenly smashed glass display cabinets inside the busy shopping centre at around 11am.

Daylight robbery: The gang filled bags with the expensive jewellery before dashing from the shop

Dramatic footage shows the three men filling bags with expensive jewels and watches before making a quick getaway. 

Christmas shoppers were hurried into nearby shops which put their shutters down to protect the public from the axe-wielding thugs.

After spending less than a minute inside the store the thieves made their escape with thousands of pounds worth of watches and jewellery.

Witness Nick Woods, 28, a sales adviser at a Virgin Media stand nearby, said: 'I was walking back from my break when I saw a women run out of the shopping centre screaming 'they're smashing it up' repeatedly before she went towards Primark and fainted.

'I was wondering what was going on when I saw a man with a balaclava and axe.

'He started shouting at a taxi driver who had blocked their car to move.

'I came in to see my colleague picking up watches from among the broken glass and handing them to security.

Angela Morris, manager at nearby Pandora jewellers, added: 'The first thing I heard was screams.

'I was in the office so I grabbed the phone and called for security to come down.

'We advised customers to stay in and asked those outside to come in before we dropped the shutters.

'It makes you realise how vulnerable you are, even though you work in a shopping centre these things still happen.'

Shopper Rose Love, 51, from Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'I'm shocked. You don't expect it to happen in a shopping centre where you think it's safe.

'I feel sorry for the staff. 

'It's unbelievable what people are willing to do. Hopefully it's a one off and people can still enjoy shopping.'

Jordan Powell, manager at Swarovski jewellers, said: 'I heard shouting and screaming then saw a few blokes in balaclavas followed by the smashing of glass.

'Everyone froze. I got staff and customers out the back of our store and came back in to drop the shutter before escorting people out into the loading area.

'It was all over in a flash and the police were here by the time we got back to the store.'

No one was hurt during the incident at the Beaverbrook store in a shopping centre in Stoke-on-Trent

One passer-by captured the terrifying moment the gang struck and began filming on her mobile phone.

In the 20 second clip the trio can be heard shouting at each other to hurry up before one man can be heard saying: 'I'll f***ing have you.'

The woman, who did not want to be named, added: 'It was like something from a film, they were just smashing the place up and had these great big axes.

'I can't believe they did this at a busy time of the day when there were so many people around.

'I just hope the video can help catch those responsible because it left many staff and shoppers absolutely paralysed with fear. It was terrifying.'

A spokesman for the shopping centre said: 'We can confirm Staffordshire Police are investigating a robbery at intu Potteries, which took place on Monday, November 17.

'No one was hurt during the incident and we're open as normal.'

A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'A quantity of jewellery has been taken and our detectives are taking statements from numerous members of the public.

'There is no indication of how old the three men are or their ethnicity.' 

Anna Blackburn, CEO of Beaverbrooks said: 'We can confirm an incident took place this morning at our Hanley store. This is a matter being handled by the police and therefore we cannot comment on the investigation. 

'We are doing everything we can to assist the police in their enquiries and to ensure our team have all the support during this distressing time.'
