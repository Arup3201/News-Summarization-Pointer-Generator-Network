A passenger on a Newark-bound United Airlines flight was taken into custody after he allegedly began screaming that he had secrets from the CIA and repeatedly mentioned the name of NSA leaker Edward Snowden.

Jacques Roizen, one of a handful of people who were forced to restrain the man, told ABC News that the disturbed passenger stood up and began frantically shouting about 10 hours into the 16-hour flight from Hong Kong.

The man was frightened and believed he had been poisoned, Roizen said. He pleaded for the flight to be diverted to Canada.

Roizen and four or five other passengers, including a flight attendant, jumped on him when he began reaching for his pockets, the Associated Press reported.

In custody: A passenger on a flight from Hong Kong is arrested at the Newark airport on Monday

The suspect is seen in blue being led out of the airplane by law enforcement authorities

The passenger stood up and made the statement several hours into the trip and the flight crew decided to continue on to Newark

They were able to restrain him with zip 
ties and they tried to calm him down for the remainder of the flight by 
talking about their families and Father's Day, he added.

The passenger, who has not 
been named, was met at Newark Liberty International Airport around 2 p.m. by more than
 a dozen federal law enforcement officials.

His hands were zip-tied behind his back as he was led out of United Airlines flight 
116 and onto the tarmac, where several police vehicles and an ambulance 
were waiting. He was wearing a dark hooded jacket, a blue shirt and 
khaki pants.

Officials say the man appeared to be mentally disturbed and was taken to nearby University Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.

Initial reports said he had claimed on board the plane that other passengers had been poisoned, but two witnesses said they never heard him make that statement.

Witnesses described him as American and said he had shouted out his name, birthdate and Social Security number. He also claimed that he is an employee of a U.S. embassy in the Middle East, according to the AP.

The passenger referred to NSA leaker Edward Snowden several times, according to one of the passengers who restrained him

A dozen law enforcement officials walk up a police ramp and enter the airplane where the suspect was reportedly being restrained by passengers

It's not known at this point whether he 
has any ties to Edward Snowden, the 29-year-old former security 
contractor who leaked classified information to the media regarding two 
government surveillance programs.Â 

Snowden fled to Hong Kong on May 20 
and he is believed to still be hiding out there. He claims he worked for
 the CIA between 2007 and 2009, before he started work as a security contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
cleared the plane at the airport and determined there was no evidence of poison on 
board. None of the 238 passengers have reported feeling sick.

Witnesses were allowed to leave the airport after being interviewed by the FBI and Port Authority Police detectives.

Officials led the suspect, wearing a dark blue hooded jacket, to an ambulance that was on scene

There is no indication that any passengers have actually been poisoned
