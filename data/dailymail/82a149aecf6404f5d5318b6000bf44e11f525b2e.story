It's been uninhabited by anyone but squatters for 25 years and the walls of each and every room are scrawled with graffiti.

Yet the long-abandoned home on Thornley Street Leichhardt in Sydney's inner west, is expected to be sold for about $1.2 million dollars when auctioned off to home-buyers.

Despite being structurally sound, with half-decent floor boards and ceilings still intact, the price of a full-scale renovation would cost the future-buyers another $300,000 to $500,000 just to make it liveable.

A decrepit house on Thornley Street in Leichhardt, is expected to sell for $1.2 million dollars despite being abandoned for 25 years and being covered in graffiti

Despite the decrepit condition of the Leichhardt home in Sydney's inner west, agent Jonathan Hammond said interest shown by potential buyers has been 'unprecedented' despite the property only being on the market for eight days.

'Since the campaign went live, the level of interest has been unprecedented in terms of people doing virtual tours online, the amount of emails and the number of contracts issued,' he said.

'In terms of the number of groups through, we've had 54 groups of two to four people come to the open inspections as well as two private inspections.

'In terms of email inquiries we've had about 4,000 people that have viewed the property online, which is very strong.'

Despite only being on the market for eight days, the property has received an 'unprecedented' amount of attention including 54 inspection groups and 4,000 email inquiries

Potential buyers have mostly included younger couples trying to up-size in the immediate area, builders or investors hoping to renovate and then sell and investors looking to subdivide the property

The house is the second run-down property in the area to attract price-tags set around the million mark, after a property in Stanmore sold for $923,000 in early June despite containing rotting floors, crumbling ceilings and being packed full of garbage.

But despite the median price for a property in Sydney reaching $679,000 in June after growing almost 17 per cent in the three months to May, Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens warned investors hoping to make big gains to 'take care'.

'People should not assume that prices always rise. They don't; sometimes they fall,' Mr Stevens said at a Australasian Meeting of the International Econometric Society in Hobart.

'Some segments of the housing market do appear to have been calming down lately. Prices have flattened out in several cities and even in Sydney the pace of increase has lessened.

'It remains to be seen whether this slower pace of growth in dwelling prices is temporary or more persistent.'

Not a pretty sight from the back either: The house, which was originally built in the 1800s, has a sandstone foundation and a double fronted late Victorian facade on a 360 squared metre property

A two-bedroom house in Durham St, Stanmore sold for $923,000 in early June despite the fact that it was uninhabitable in its present state

The house was littered with garbage, despite the fact that realtors had already removed nine truckloads of rubbish from the property

The house, which was originally built in the 1800s, has a sandstone foundation and a double-fronted late Victorian facade on a 360 square metre property.

It has no bathrooms or kitchen after they were ripped out by the current owner who was indecisive about his renovation plans, but rather only the shell of four rooms which still contain their original fireplaces.

Mr Hammond said a combination of the home's unique design and large size has made it desirable to buyers.

'There are mostly smaller homes around the 200 square metre mark, like modest cottages, in the area,' he said.

'For people who like the area but need more space, this is the potential for them to build their dream home.'

This Waterloo home on Phillip Street on a 133 square metre block was snapped up in four weeks

Despite being structurally sound, with decent floor boards and ceilings still intact, the price of a full-scale renovation would cost somewhere between $300,000 and $500,000.

But it's the decrepit state of the home that is drawing in potential future owners rather than deterring them, according to Mr Hammond, who claims the imperfections present them with a 'potential to paint the picture the way they would like it'.

'If the place was in an average habitable condition you'd be looking at the $1.5 or $1.6 million mark, so I think as a buyer coming through, this state of it has generated more inquiry,' he said.

'They can come and make it their own.

Its new owners have decided to knock it down and built a new home from scratch

The original bathroom was still intact and there was another external bathroom, but the kitchen was non-existent

'There has so far been younger couples trying to up-size in the immediate area, builders or investors hoping to renovate and then sell and investors looking to subdivide the property.'

It seems run-down properties are proving to be quite popular. Recently another 'dilapidated' home in Waterloo was auctioned off for $807,000.

The Phillip St home sits on a 133 square metre piece of land and is positioned a corner block.

Its new owners are planning to knock it down and build a new home on the block.

The conveniently located property was auctioned off for $807,000

If they kept the original structure, it was estimated it would have cost at least $150,000 to $200,000 to renovate.

The home was a two-storey terrace house and was on the market for four weeks.

It had retained its original bathroom and had another external bathroom, but the kitchen was non-existent.

According to real estate agents, the Waterloo property proved to be popular because of its convenient location - on the city's fringe - directly across the road from Redfern Oval.

The Paddington home is expected to sell for more than $1.25 million and will go under the hammer on July 19
