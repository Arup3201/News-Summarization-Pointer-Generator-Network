A thief broke into the Tower of London and stole keys belonging to guards in an astonishing security blunder.

The raider is said to have managed to scale the Front Gate to enter the fortress which holds the Crown Jewels.Â 

The bunch of keys which unlock drawbridges, were in a metal box which was meant to have been securely locked,  the Sun reported.

Break-in: A thief broke into the Tower of London and stole keys belonging to guards in an astonishing security blunder

On guard: A security guard protects the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London. Guards spotted the thief, but after radioing for assistance, they were unable to leave their posts

Although priceless, the crown jewels at the Tower of London have only once attracted the attention of thieves.

In 1671, one Colonel Blood gained entry to the Tower, dressed in the robes of a priest.

He overpowered the guards with his three accomplices, and ran off with the crown, orb and sceptre in his hands.

The plan fell was thwarted at the getaway and he only made it to the East Gate of the Tower.

Surprisingly Blood was pardoned by Charles II.

Guards spotted the thief, but could only radio for assistance, as strict rules meant they could not give chase as they were unable to leave their posts.

But their pleas for back-up were ignored and the raider managed to get away, forcing the management to spend thousands urgently changing the locks.

It was claimed that the keys, which were stolen on Guy Fawkes night, could also unlock conference rooms and the restaurant.

As a result of the embarrassing security blunder the locks had to be changed, at an estimated cost of thousands of pounds.

The Met Police confirmed that they had received a report of theft and it is being investigated by Tower Hamlets CID.

The tower is traditionally guarded by Yeoman Warders, or Beefeaters, but they are supported by a private security firm.

Target: The management insisted the Crown Jewels were not at risk, but the theft raises questions about the level of security at the tourist hot spot

The management insisted the monarch's 
most valuable possession were not at risk, but the theft raises 
questions about the level of security at the tourist hot spot.

In the run up to London 2012 Games,the 
prized Olympic and Paralympic medals were under lock and key at the 
Tower of London, where the Crown Jewels are kept under armed guard.

The IRA planted a bomb in the 11th 
century fortress in 1974, killing one woman and injuring 41, several of 
them children who lost limbs.

A
 spokesman for Historic Royal Palaces, which runs the Tower, told the MailOnline: .

'It would not have been possible to 
gain access to the Tower with any of these keys and at no point was the 
security of the Tower at risk. All affected locks were immediately 
changed.

We have carried out an internal 
investigation and have concluded that our well-established security 
systems and procedures are robust. However on this occasion, these 
procedures were not carried out to the expected standard. A staff 
disciplinary procedure is underway to address this issue.'
