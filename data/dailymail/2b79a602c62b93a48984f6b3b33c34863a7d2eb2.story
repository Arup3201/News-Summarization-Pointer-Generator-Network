A Canadian mayor caught up in a scandal over an alleged video of him smoking what appears to be crack cocaine has denied that he uses the drug.

'I do not use crack cocaine, nor am I an addict of crack cocaine,' Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said in a press conference Friday afternoon, after a week of silence since reports of the video emerged. 'As for a video, I cannot comment on a video that I have not seen, or does not exist.'

Reading from a piece of paper, Ford said the controversy had 'taken a great toll on my family and my friends and the great people of Toronto.'

'For the past week, on the advice of my solicitor, I was advised not to say a word I want to thank the people of this great city for their outpouring of support,' he said.

Denial: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford makes a statement regarding allegations from the media that he was caught smoking crack-cocaine on camera

Where's the video? He said he could not comment on a video he had not seen or does not exist

No questions: The mayor took no questions and walked away as a reporter asked him whether he had ever used crack cocaine

The mayor took no questions and walked away as a reporter asked him whether he had ever used crack cocaine.

The press conference comes on the 
same day that members of his executive committee sent him a letter 
urging him to confront the allegations.

'The
allegations need to be addressed openly and transparently,' the letter 
reads. 'We are encouraging the Mayor to address this matter so that we 
can continue to focus on serving the people of Toronto.'

The letter was released after it was revealed that Ford had suddenly fired his chief of staff, Mark Towhey. According to some reports, the dismissal came after Towhey urged his boss to seek help for his addiction.

Reports on the gossip website Gawker
and in the Toronto Star say the video was recorded by men claiming that they had 
sold the drug to Ford.

The Star reported that two 
journalists had watched a video that appears to show Ford, sitting in a 
chair, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe.

Gawker and the Star said the video was shown to them by a drug dealer who had been trying to sell it for a six-figure sum.

City Councilor Jaye Robinson said she 
was told Towhey's firing was unrelated to the scandal, but rather had 
something to do with football.

Ford was fired as coach of a 
Catholic high school football team on Wednesday - a development school 
officials also denied was related to the scandal.Â 

Toronto
Catholic District School Board spokesman John Yan said the decision to 
remove Ford as the head of Don Bosco Eagles Football program on 
Wednesday had to do with the comments the mayor made to the Sun TV 
Network in March that parents found offensive.

Ford has been ducking the media and his only comments on the scandal came last Friday, a day after the story broke, when he called the crack smoking allegations 'ridiculous' and said that the Toronto Star was out to get him.

Ford has been embroiled in almost weekly controversies about his behavior since being elected in 2010, but the crack video allegations are the most serious allegations he's faced yet.

The Star also reported that in the video Ford allegedly made a racist remark about high school football students he coached.

The video has not been released publicly and it's authenticity has not been verified.

Last week, Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, told the Toronto Sun that the mayor is denying 'any such allegation.'

'We're just trying to see whether or not such a video exists and whether or not any video has been doctored or altered,' Morris told the Toronto Sun.

Ford, who is no stranger to controversy, was elected mayor of Toronto more than two years ago after serving as a Councillor for 10 years.
