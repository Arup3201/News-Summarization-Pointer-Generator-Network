Four teens giggled as they recorded themselves cold-cocking a homeless man at a train station outside Philadelphia - then uploaded the video to Facebook for all the world to see.

Now police are trying to track down the perpetrators of the city's latest brutal 'Knockout Game' attack.

The video shows the teens laughing and joking before one suddenly punches the man in the face.

Laughing more, they run off - out the train station.Â

Shocking: Video shows this teenage (right) punching a homeless man in the face without provocation or warning last week

On the lookout: This is the suspect who punched a homeless man as part of the 'knockout game.' He showed his face in a video recorded by his friends

Police in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, a Philadelphia suburb, say the victim had significant damage to his eye.

'These are cowardly punks. There was no reason for them to do this other than pure evil,' police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told the Delaware County Daily Times.

'For no reason, they hit this guy. They could have killed him.'

The victim spoke to WTFX-TV and said he feels lucky he wasn't more seriously hurt.

'It could have been worse because they did hit me with glasses on, and they could have sent my glasses right into my eyes,' he said.

'I take anxiety medicine and it was quite a setback.'

The video taken by one of the teens shows the attacker approach the man, who is sitting on a bench and begin bantering with him.

'What're you trying to do?' the teen asks.

'I'm not trying to do nothing. I'm just sitting here,' the man replies.

Then, the boy suddenly turns around and punches the victim in the face.

The Knockout Game is a disturbing new trend in youth violence and the Philadelphia area has seen more than its fair share of indictments.

The rules of the brutal 'game' include randomly picking targets in public and punching them - or beating them - for no reason, other than the amusement of the attackers.

Last year at least three cases of 'knockout game' were reported in the city - including on that left a chef in the hospital with a broken jaw.

It has proved fatal in some cases, including last September when three boys, age 13 and 14, killed a homeless man in Hoboken, New Jersey, after sucker-punching him.
