A number of McDonald's restaurants have been slammed for advertising their fast food directly to young children and offering them free food products. 

The Advertising Standards Board (ASB) heard that the fast food chain issued vouchers to children aged 10 years and under who were participating in the University of Sunshine Coast Basketball Club Competition in late September.

Forming part of the Team Spirit Award handed to the children, the voucher was redeemable for a 'small cheeseburger meal' or 'seared snack wrap, apple bag and small orange juice' at eight McDonald's restaurants in the Sunshine Coast, Queensland.

McDonald's restaurants in Victoria and the Sunshine Coast have been caught advertising fast food to children under the age of 14 

The ASB upheld the complaint, finding that McDonald's had breached the Quick Service Restaurant Initiative for Responsible Advertising to Children (QSRI) as the products advertised did not meet the nutritional criteria.

The complainant claimed that the fast food chain had 'little concern for the dietary health of Australian children' due to repeatedly breaching the QSRI. 

The comment referred to an earlier instance in July when McDonald's stores were found to have breached the code after handing out vouchers at a playground in Victoria.

Picturing Ronald McDonald standing with a group of people on one side with the words 'play money', the other side of the voucher had an image of McDonald's chips next to the words 'free small fries with any purchase'.

The most recent complaint regarded a voucher redeemable for a small cheeseburger meal' or 'seared snack wrap, apple bag and small orange juice' that was handed out as an award for children participating in the University of Sunshine Coast Basketball Club Competition in late September

The vouchers were redeemable at five different McDonald's restaurants in Victoria.

McDonald's responded to the complaint by saying that the vouchers were withdrawn and made no longer available once it became aware of the breach.

'We believe this Complaint to be an isolated incident concerning the Nominated Restaurants only,' the chain restaurant wrote to the ASB.

'McDonald's is a business with over 920 restaurants and whilst we have strict controls in place to ensure compliance with the QSRI the Voucher was unfortunately not passed through our standard internal review and approval process.'

The ASB upheld the complaints, finding that McDonald's had breached the Quick Service Restaurant Initiative for Responsible Advertising to Children (QSRI)

Following the second incident, McDonald's responded again by saying the Awards had been withdrawn and made no longer available.

'In light of this complaint… McDonald's has updated its guidelines in consultation with the ASB in relation to its compliance requirements when providing food or beverage vouchers to children under 14 years of age,' it wrote in response to the complaint.

'All members of the McDonald's system will be reminded of their responsibilities under the QSRI to ensure that only food and beverages that represent healthier choices are promoted to children.

'We have also reaffirmed our standard advertising review protocol which requires advertising to be approved through appropriate channels. Training has and will continue to be undertaken with relevant McDonald's team members to improve understanding in these areas.'
