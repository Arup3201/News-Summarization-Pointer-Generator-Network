Blackpool boss Jose Riga has put pressure on chairman Karl Oyston to strike a deal for Belgian midfielder Jonathan Legear.

The 27-year-old, who has two caps, has spent the last two weeks training with the struggling Championship side in an effort to earn a permanent contract. 

He is a free agent after leaving KV Mechelen.

Riga said: ‘I want to bring players to the club, believe me. The problem is I’m not sure everyone else wants the same.

‘The longer we have waited to sign players, the more difficult it becomes.’

The Seasiders have had a disastrous start to the season that has seen them win just one of their opening 13 games.

Blackpool are rock-bottom of the table, five points adrift of safety.
