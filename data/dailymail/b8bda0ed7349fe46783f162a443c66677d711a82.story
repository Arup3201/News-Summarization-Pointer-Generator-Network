Moeen Ali stole the show for England as they levelled their five Test series against India on Thursday.

Known as 'The Beard' the middle-order batsman proved Alastair Cook's saviour collecting six wickets for 67 runs during the visitors' second innings at the Ageas Bowl.

In light of his heroic performance, Sportsmail assesses the top ten best beards in the world of sport.

Hashim Amla

The South African is a fully practising Muslim; he told The Guardian that he wears his beard as a 'personal tribute to Islam.' Amla has scored over 6,000 runs in Test cricket and cracked an unbeaten 311 against England at the Oval in 2012, part of a record-breaking South African effort of 637-2 declared.

Adam Clayton

The Huddersfield midfielder made the headlines last year with this ever-growing beard. After netting a screamer in stoppage time to beat Yeovil, Clayton dyed his beard blue and white, his side’s home colours, for the last game of the season held at the John Smith’s Stadium. He raised over £3,000 for charity in the process.

Simon Whitlock

The Australian darts player has always sported an impressive thin beard to compliment his pony tail. The 2012 European Championships winner uses a hair straightener on his beard before leaving the house and claimed two years ago that his trip to the hairdresser can last nine hours.

Tim Howard 

The Everton goalkeeper has sported a rather dark, bushy beard in recent times and even told the media that it gave him the strength to save a Christian Benteke penalty at Villa Park.

Perhaps the American’s beard does indeed contain magical powers after he pulled off a string of saves at the World Cup. A Twitter account called '@timhowardsbeard' has been set up in its honour.

Brett Keisel

The facial hair of the 35-year-old NFL defensive end has proved an absolute sensation in America. 'Da Beard,' as it has become known, has its own Facebook and Twitter pages and was recently shaved to raise $40,000 (£23,750) for a children’s charity.

W.G. Grace

One of cricket’s most remembered figures sported a fine beard throughout his career. Grace struck over 50,000 First-Class runs in his time, including 124 hundreds, to add to his 2,800 wickets.

Erik Lund

The Biarritz lock forward may not be the most instantly recognisable of names, but his beard certainly sets him apart from the rest. Originally from Norway, his nickname of 'The Viking' probably describes him best. His brother Magnus has played rugby for England too.

Andrew Hall

The Northamptonshire cricketer deserves a mention for his display both of facial hair and endurance during the 2010 season. He bet his team-mates that he would not shave until his side were eliminated from the Twenty20 competition.

Sadly for Hall though happily for Northamptonshire, it took eight weeks for the aforementioned to happen. Hall became stuck with a thick, gingery and itchy beard. Relief finally arrived after defeat to Somerset.

Robert Oberst

A competitor in the strongman competition, Oberst lifts cars, carries logs and deadlifts huge weights, all whilst carrying an amazing beard.

The relative newcomer to the strongman series also has nine siblings and twenty three nephews and nieces.

Olof Mellberg

The popular Swede, who retired from football on Thursday, was always distinguishable by his beard. A no nonsense defender, Mellberg spent seven years with Aston Villa before eventually finishing his career at FC Copenhagen.

At his last game for Villa, he brought every fan who travelled to Upton Park a shirt with his name on the back.
