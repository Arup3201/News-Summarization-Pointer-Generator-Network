A baker claims she has cooked the world's biggest mince pie after it weighed in at two stone and containing 56,140 calories - 22 times the recommended daily calorie intake for a man.

Charlotte Shaw, 40, of Lottie Shaw's bakery in Elland, near Halifax, West Yorkshire, created the festive favourite using 12.5kg of mincemeat and 1.5kg of sweet pastry.

She designed a custom-made reinforced steel tray to produce the pie, which measured a monstrous 27-inches - the same size as a typical four by four tyre.

Charlotte said: 'It is 27 inches which is massive and probably about the equivalent of a large tyre. It took about an hour to cook - it normally takes 23 minutes. It is huge.

'We think we have we have made the world's biggest mince pie that actually looks like a mince pie. 

'It has got the star cut out on top too just as we would with our normal sized pies - only difference is this 100 times bigger.'

The giant pie had to be transported around the bakery from machine to machine by six people due to its size.

The mincemeat filling alone weighed in at 12.5 kg, just shy of two stone and the traditional sweet pastry, a family recipe of Charlotte's, added another 1.5kg.

One of the largest mince pies ever made was an 18-feet-long pie, baked in three separate tins, at Prestatyn, in 2007, in an rectangular shape. 

However, Charlotte and her bakers were able to make a giant version that looks more like the traditional circular mince pie.

The finished product was a 27-inch diameter mine pie - the same size as a typical 4x4 tyre.

Six people were needed to carry it around the bakery because of its size.

The mincemeat filling weighs 12.5kg, just shy of two stone. Normal pies contain just 30g of mincemeat. 

The traditional sweet pastry was 1.5kg

To do this Charlotte had to have a reinforced custom-made steel tray designed to hold the pie and this was then covered with foil to ensure it retained its shape.

Charlotte said: 'We had a local steel manufacturing company make us the tin. We couldn't find foil big enough to hold or cover the pie. So we used this steel tin to replicated the foil and hold it in place. It was just far too heavy for foil. So we worked with the local business to achieve this.'

Once Charlotte had the tin made, it was foiled and then lined with silicon grease proof paper before the 1.5kg of pastry were rolled out using a commercial rolling pin called a pastry brake machine.

She added: 'It was then rolled over the pin, although it was rather heavy, and then carefully put inside the tin. Because it was so big we had to do it with the pastry brake.'

The bakers then put 12.5 kg of mincemeat inside the pastry case and cut by hand a 27 inch lid of pastry in the shape of a star and carefully slid it atop the pie.

A total of six bakers were needed to move the massive mince pie around the kitchen in Elland, near Halifax, West Yorkshire

Baker Charlotte Shaw said the only difference between the record breaking pie and their traditional festive favourite is the size, 'it is 100 times bigger,' she said

Normal sized mince pies usually contain just 30 grams of mincemeat.

Charlotte said: 'We had to cut the lid on a box because we couldn't transport it easily. It was just huge.

'The scariest bit was probably waiting to find out that we had cooked it enough and that it didn't have a soggy bottom!'

However the pie isn't just for decoration, Lottie Shaw's bakery will be donating to the pie to their local Forget Me Not Children's Hospice who have been working with the Huddersfield Giants Rugby team.

She said: 'We are donating it for a good cause. I don't know if they will be auctioning it off to the rugby players or putting on a charity event to see how much these rugby players can eat of it - we know they have high calorie diets but I am not sure if they could stomach 60,000. Or maybe everyone at the hospice will get to eat it.'

She added: 'We wanted to do something fun for the run up to Christmas - everyone loves a mince. We sell four for £2.85. But we thought, how about a giant mince pie! We also wanted to do something good for a local charity!'
