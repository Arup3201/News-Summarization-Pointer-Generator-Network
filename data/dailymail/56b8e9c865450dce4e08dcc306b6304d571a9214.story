Model Cara Delevingne is toning down her party lifestyle and toning up instead – with the help of the Prime Minister’s personal trainer.

Cara, a catwalk favourite for luxury brands including Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana and Chanel, has become a member of the exclusive women’s-only gym Grace Belgravia in Central London.

Under the guidance of trainers led by celebrity fitness consultant Matt Roberts – the man who has helped Naomi Campbell and David and Samantha Cameron – Cara is lifting weights to help create long, lean muscles.

Fitness friends: Cara Delevingne and fellow supermodel Suki Waterhouse are both members of the exclusive Grace Belgravia gym in London

She has been seen working out in the gym a couple of times a week, often with fellow model Suki Waterhouse.

The price of fitness does not come cheap, however – annual membership at Grace Belgravia costs up to £5,500, plus a £2,000 joining fee.  But given that Cara will soon be seen in her underwear for the Victoria’s Secret UK show, she may feel it money well spent.

Almost a third of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) sufferers are intolerant of fructose, according to a new study.  Fructose is a naturally occurring sugar found in fruit, vegetables and honey, and is often added to soft drinks and processed foods.

The study from Rouen University Hospital in France shows it appears to be a risk factor for IBS and other gastrointestinal disorders, which affect at least ten per cent of the population in Europe.

Dr Charles Murray, consultant gastroenterologist at London’s Royal Free Hospital, says: ‘A low-fructose diet is definitely worth considering in IBS patients.’

Beware
 the temptation of crisps and biscuits – it’s not only their flavour 
that lures you to eat more but also their crunch.

The texture of food is
 just as important to our eating habits as taste, smell and look, 
according to researchers at the University of South Florida.

They 
studied the links between how food feels when chewing and how much 
people consume. The results showed that we perceive food that is harder 
and rough-textured to contain fewer calories, so we may be fooled into 
consuming more.

Rosy hips? Rosehip extracts has been proven to help with arthritis symptoms in the past

An extract from the humble rosehip is helping to ease pain for millions of arthritis sufferers.

New Danish research, presented at the Osteoarthritis Research Society International World Congress, has added to a growing body of evidence showing that GOPO – a compound derived from rosehip – reduces joint pain, improves mobility and reduces inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA).

OA affects more than 600 million people worldwide, and the latest guidelines advise against the long-term use of paracetamol.

‘GOPO Joint Health capsules could now be used as a first-line treatment for a three-month trial period in patients with OA,’ says Dr John Dickson, co-founder of the Primary Care Rheumatology Society.

Simply looking in a bedside mirror has been found to be an effective way to help calm patients who feel disorientated or agitated after surgery.

Up to half of those aged 65 and over are estimated to experience post-operative delirium (POD). Bright lights coupled with unfamiliar surroundings and the trauma of anaesthesia and surgery combine to trigger the condition.

Giving patients who seem disorientated a hand-held mirror is a method long used by nurses – but evidence that it helps induce calm has always been anecdotal.

Now doctors at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge have installed bedside mirrors in intensive care units in the first trial to formally study how and why it might work.

Unlikely as it sounds, tomatoes  may 
be a major cause of unwanted body odour.  Dr Charles Stewart, a retired 
pharmaceutical physician in Northern Ireland, claims that eating just 
two tomatoes can lead to the unpleasant smell that lasts for up to a 
week.

Dr Stewart’s own 
situation prompted him to investigate. ‘I was aware of my underarm odour
 one hot summer seven years ago, when colleagues routinely opened 
windows in my presence,’ he says. ‘I stopped eating tomatoes and have 
not been troubled by the smell since.’

Tomato hairs contain a pungent oil that helps defend the plant against insect attack – and this smells like underarm odour.
