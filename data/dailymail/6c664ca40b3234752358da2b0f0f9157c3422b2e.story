From embracing their children in the comfort of their homes to parking their cars in lots, these women are pictured going about their daily lives.

But these everyday scenes have one striking thing in common - the female subjects are all carrying guns. And they are all willing to pull the trigger.

Most of the women, all of whom are from Texas, carry lethal weapons - including handguns, rifles and shotguns - around with them for protection.

Others, meanwhile, collect firearms like they might Wedgwood china, a music icon's merchandise or designer shoes.

The women were photographed by Shelly Calton for her series, Concealed, which explores the lives of Texas women who have taken to carrying guns.

Ms Calton, who was taught how to shoot as a child, said growing up in Houston was synonymous with an induction into the state's gun culture.

'I like to photograph where I live. The majorities are from Houston and surrounding towns,' the 55-year-old said of her subjects. 'They come from diverse backgrounds, each with their own individual story and personal motivations.'

She said the armed women are often unassuming and unexpected: young mothers with their babies at supermarket checkout counters, grandmothers walking their dogs, or women pulling up outside shopping centers. 'My photographs showcase the diversity of this population,' she said.

She added: 'However, I found a commonality in their response to the question, "are you prepared to pull the trigger to protect yourself or your loved ones?" The answer from the women in this collection of portraits is a resounding "yes".'

In her bedroom: Ms Calton, who met her subjects through a network of friends, said that while it is a known fact that women own guns, they often do not openly discuss it openly. She said that her own experience with guns made the women feel comfortable to discuss their guns

Ms Calton, who met her subjects through a network of friends, said that while it is a known fact that women own guns, they often do not openly discuss it openly. She said that her own experience with guns made the women feel comfortable to discuss the reasons they own firearms.

'A large percentage of the women that I photographed for "Concealed" have a license to carry concealed on their body,' she said. 'Some keep them in their homes locked in a safe or in their bedside table.

'Texas law allows a person to carry a gun concealed in your car without a license, many people do this for protection while traveling.'

Under Texas law, residents can publicly display long guns, such as rifles and shotguns. However, they cannot 'open carry' handguns. These guns must be kept within the owner's home or concealed in their vehicle, unless the owner is engaging in a sporting activity 'where the activity is conducted'.

Aim and shoot: Ms Calton many women in Texas own rifles and shotguns for sport, while handguns are most purchased for protection

Ms Calton said that many people in the state own rifles and shotguns for sport, while handguns are mostly purchased for protection.

'Some receive guns passed on through their families. Others choose to own handguns due to their personal experiences, perhaps they have been threatened or attacked,' she said. 'A few of them because their loved ones want them to be able to defend themselves if needed.'

The photographer explained that as an adult, guns had become a smaller part of her life - at least, until she was inspired to create the photo series.

'Recently, the option of carrying a gun for protection began to present itself, showing up through the women I photographed for my book Hard Knocks, Tex Offender's Pistols and again in the body of work I called Nécessaire, Colt 44,' said Ms Calton, who learned to shoot as a child

'Recently, the option of carrying a gun for protection began to present itself, showing up through the women I photographed for my book Hard Knocks, Tex Offender's Pistols and again in the body of work I called Nécessaire, Colt 44,' she said. 

'A friend's startling experience in a hair salon of a woman's handgun accidentally going off and the bullet ricocheting around the salon was a catalyst for my renewed interest in firearms in today's culture and specifically in women who carry concealed handguns.'
