An Oxford professor who was found dead at a fellow academic's home had suffered a mental breakdown in the last year, it was revealed.

Colleagues of eminent astrophysicist Steven Rawlings said he had been struggling with mental health problems since summer last year.

They have become so bad that Professor Rawlings, 50, had stepped down from his role in overseeing the team building the world's largest radio telescope.

Professor Rawlings had played a huge part in developing the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) - which will be able to look 13 billion years back in time to the beginnings of the universe.

But he was unable to complete his project and also dropped out of his academic work at Oxford University's St Peter's College.

Best friend Dr Devinder Sivia was yesterday released on bail as police downgraded the investigation into the academic's death.

Mathematician Dr Sivia, 49, had shared dinner at a local pub with Professor Rawlings on Wednesday night and became increasingly concerned about his friend's behaviour.

Staff at the Bear hotel in Wantage, Oxfordshire, said frequent visitor Professor Rawlings was unusually subdued.

Former Nasa worker Dr Sivia invited him to stay at his bungalow in Southmoor, near Abingdon, Oxfordshire, but when they got to his home his friend apparently became increasingly agitated and apparently attacked Dr Sivia.

In the altercation that followed, the professor collapsed on the floor from a suspected heart attack.

Dr Sivia dialed 999 and alerted neighbours, but despite their efforts to resuscitate him he died at the scene.

Professor Phil Diamond, who had worked closely with Professor Rawlings on the SKA scheme, told the newspaper: 'He became very withdrawn and dropped out of both his academic work and the SKA.

'I was told he suffered some mental problems but I don't know what caused them.

'I thought he was suffering from depression but he had shown no symptoms before, nor at this meeting in Rome.'

Held: Dr Devinder Sivia has been bailed following the death of his colleague and best friend Steven Rawlings, who was found dead at the maths lecturer's home

Professor Rawlings distraught widow said last night her husband's death was not murder.

Linda Rawlings said: 'Steve and Devinder were best friends since college and I believe this is a tragic accident.

'I do not believe that Steve's death is murder and I do not believe Devinder should be tarnished in this way.'

Dr Sivia's brother Gurdip insisted the death could only have been an unfortunate tragedy. He said of Dr Sivia: 'There is just no anger in him, ever.

'He would have walked away from any confrontation. He would never say boo to a goose. Even if someone attacked him, I cannot believe he would fight back.'

The maths lecturer was arrested on suspicion of murder but police now believe there may have been no criminal offence committed.

Dr Sivia, who teaches 'maths with natural sciences' to chemistry and physics students at St John's College in Oxford, is apparently 'absolutely beside himself' at the death of his best friend.

The mathematician's family said the two men had been close since meeting as young undergraduates at St John's College in Cambridge more than 30 years ago.

His father, Gurbakhsh Sivia, 80, said his son rang him from a police station after his arrest to say: 'Dad, there's been a tragedy and I'm in police custody under suspicion. It's being investigated but I'm hoping it will be sorted out.'

Professor Rawlings and Dr  Sivia co-wrote a book titled Foundations    Of Science Mathematics, which was printed in paperback in 1999.

Part of the Oxford Chemistry Primers series, it provides explanations of mathematical principles for undergraduates  studying for a wide range of  science degrees.

The book, available for £13.99, covers topics ‘from basic  arithmetic and algebra to calculus’ and was praised by reviewers on the internet, one of whom described it as ‘brilliant’.

The reviewer added: ‘I have found it so useful, as I am a physics undergraduate, for my course. 

‘It covers everything I need and will be useful to look back at  maths I have done in the past, for future reference.

Mr Sivia, a retired maths teacher from Gravesend, Kent, said the whole family was shocked.

'They were very, very good friends, inseparable friends. They were like brothers. My son is a good son and a dedicated teacher. He has very simple habits – he never drinks, he never smokes. It's unimaginable.

'They've been friends ever since they studied at Cambridge University together. I've known him for 20 years. When my son was ill, Steven would bring flowers and food to his house to help out.'

After hearing his son had been released, Mr Sivia said: 'Although this is some ray of good news, it is still a tragedy as Steven is not with us any more.'

The Sivia family moved from Punjab, India, when Devinder was five. He was educated in England and studied science at Cambridge, completing a first degree and PhD before going to the United States to work for Nasa at their space centre for three years.

His brother Gurdip, a warehouse worker from Winson Green, Birmingham, said the British and Australian governments both wanted him to work for them after Nasa, adding: 'Eventually the British government got him back and set him up in a laboratory at Oxford.'

He said Dr Sivia was a former colleague of Dr David Kelly, the government weapons inspector found dead in woods near his Southmoor home after he was named as the source of a report that Tony Blair's government 'sexed up' its Iraq weapons dossier.

'He worked with David Kelly and knew him well,' said Gurdip, 59. 'They worked together I think and lived very near each other.'

He said his brother had never been in a serious relationship as he was 'married to his work'.

Professor Rawlings, a lead scientist in the world's largest radio telescope project, lived with his wife in Letcombe Regis, near Wantage, Oxfordshire.

In a statement issued by Thames Valley Police, Mrs Rawlings said: 'Steve was a well-loved, caring, intelligent, sensitive man. Steve is a man of integrity, kindness and a very accessible person.

'Steve was the love of my life and we have known each other all of these years and he has never changed, even though he has achieved so much and has all these qualities. I will miss him more  than anything else in the world.'

Police say a post-mortem examination proved inconclusive and further tests will be carried out over the coming weeks.

Detective Superintendent Rob Mason, from the force's major crime unit, said: 'We can confirm that the two individuals involved have been friends for over 30 years.

'I would emphasise that the police are investigating all potential circumstances that could have led to his death.

'We are mindful that ultimately the death may be a matter for a coroner's inquest rather than a criminal court and I would ask for patience from both the media and the public while we continue our investigation.'
