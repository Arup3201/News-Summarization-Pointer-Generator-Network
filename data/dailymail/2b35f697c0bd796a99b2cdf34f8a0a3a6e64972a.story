Sing when you are winning: Heather Watson became the third Briton to make it to the next round of Wimbledon

Heather Watson raised her racket in triumph yesterday as she became the third Briton to make it through to the next round of Wimbledon.

The 22-year-old rising star, who has only just recovered from glandular fever, won in straight sets over Croatian Ajla Tomljanovic.

The British number one, who went out in the first round last year, won the hearts of the home crowd after a confident win on Court Three at the All England Club.

Miss Watson made it to the second 
round despite suffering from such crippling nerves that she developed 
insomnia and could not eat beforehand.

Thanking
 the supporters afterwards, she said: From the beginning when I walked 
onto the court and they said my name, the crowd was very positive and 
behind me the whole way.

‘I really enjoyed playing here today and on that court.  I do like that court a lot.’

Miss Watson’s win is good news for her parents, who have banned from attending her matches in case it is unlucky.

But
 she has now agreed to put her superstitions aside if she makes it to 
the second week, saying: ‘We made a deal. If I get to the second week 
then they’re coming.

‘It’s absolutely possible, but I’m 
just focused on playing as best I can now. And when the draw does come 
out I’ll only be looking as far as that match.’

The
 Guernsey player, who jumped ahead of Laura Robson in the world rankings
 last month when she reached the second round of the French Open, said: 
‘I was a bit nervous going on to court. 

‘I struggle to eat before I go on, and actually my jaw was locking and I couldn’t even bite through my banana.

‘But it was good. Once I got on court, I got moving. I got into it.’

Miss
 Watson has previously spoken out about her trouble with insomnia during
 Grand Slams, and yesterday revealed that Wimbledon has been no 
exception.

She said: ‘I 
didn’t sleep that great last night. I woke up at 4am, I woke up and I 
was ready to go. But, that’s becoming normal.  It doesn’t matter.’

Alright then mum: Superstitious Miss Watson has agreed to lift the ban on her parents attending her matches if she makes it to the second week

Watson, Andy Murray, 27, and Naomi Broady, 24, are now the only Britons left in the competition.

Laura Robson, who made it the fourth round of Wimbledon last year, has been forced to miss the event this year due to a wrist injury.

Yesterday, Miss Watson paid tribute to her friend Miss Broady, who triumphed on Monday despite being was stripped of her funding as a teenager when she posted a photo of herself on a social networking site posing provocatively next to a condom machine.

Miss Watson, who is 60th in the world, while Miss Broady is 163rd. said: ‘I’m very close with Naomi, she was probably the first tennis player I did know, and our families are very close.

‘I was so happy when I saw she won, she so deserves it.’

Meanwhile there was disappointment for Samantha Murray who was thrashed in straight sets by former Wimbledon Champion Maria Sharapova. 

But she took heart from the fact she managed to ace the recent French Open winner several times.

Miss Murray, 26, from Cheshire, was a British wildcard entry and is 238th in the world, compared to number five seed Sharapova.

New man? Recently single Caroline Wozniacki

Only weeks after being unceremoniously dumped by her fiance Rory McIlroy, Caroline Wozniacki is enjoying a flirtation with Spanish player Feliciano Lopez.

Golfer McIlroy, 25, announced last month they had split up after he realised he was not ready for marriage – just days after sending out their wedding invitations.

But Danish player Wozniacki, 23, giggled and blushed when asked about fellow player Lopez yesterday, describing him as ‘a great guy’.

The press conference followed her victory against Israeli Shahar Peer in the first round of the Wimbledon Championships.

Asked about Lopez’s presence at all of her recent matches, Wozniacki laughed: ‘You noticed that, huh? Yeah, I noticed he was on the sidelines in Eastbourne. He’s a great guy. This is awkward.’

But she added that she is quite happy being single for the moment, saying: ‘To be honest, I’ll just see what happens.’

The 32-year-old Lopez was once dubbed ‘Deliciano’ by Andy Murray’s mother Judy, who tweeted: ‘Ooh Deliciano… looking good out there. As always.’

The luxury Scottish hotel owned by Andy Murray has removed references to hunting from its website after pressure from animal rights campaigners.

The Wimbledon champion bought Cromlix, near his home town of Dunblane, last year.

Campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wrote to him complaining that the hotel promoted hunting as a possible activity for guests.

Its letter said: ‘The idea of hunting cats and dogs ... would rightly make most of us sick, and yet the animals listed on the website, alongside the best times of year to kill them, have exactly the same capacity to feel pain and suffer.’

A spokesman for Murray said references to hunting were removed from the website this month and the activity was never offered on the hotel’s grounds.

Peta praised Murray last year when it emerged the hotel menu would not include foie gras.
