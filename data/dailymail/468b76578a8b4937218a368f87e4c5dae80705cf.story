A space cannon that will blast a hole into an asteroid to find out the origins of the universe has been tested by Japanese scientists.

The device will be used to gather data about the composition of the asteroid, named 1999JU3, and help investigate how water and life were created on Earth.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said the successful test has paved the way for a launch of the space cannon as early as next year.Â

The space cannon will be flown on board the Hayabusa-2 vehicle towards the asteroid, which orbits between Earth and Mars.

Once it arrives at the asteroid in 2018, Hayabusa 2 will observe the entire surface of the asteroid using a variety of remote-sensing instruments.

The spacecraft will then release a small lander called Mascot and a rover named Minerva 2 on the asteroid's surface to explore the surface in more detail.

Hayabusa means falcon in Japanese.

Hayabusa 2 is a successor to JAXA's earlier asteroid explorer Hayabusa, which returned the first asteroid samples to Earth in June 2010.

Hayabusa 2 is the third mission to land on an asteroid. Nasa's NEAR-Shoemaker mission was the first mission to touchdown on an asteroid.Hayabusa 2 is the second asteroid sample-return mission.

The space cannon will, following this initial analysis, detach itself and remotely fire a 4lb metal projectile into the surface of the 1999JU3 asteroid.

A probe will then land and collect debris samples from the impact to bring back to Earth.

Scientists are intrigued by asteroid 1999JU3 as it is thought to have been altered very little since the formation of the solar system.

Japanese researchers hope to find water and organic material from the early solar system in the material collected.

This data could shed light on how planets form and life arises.

The asteroid is currently scheduled to be blasted in 2018 and the probe will make its back to Earth by the end of the decade.

Hayabusa-2 is the second project from Japan to recover particles from deep space.

It builds on the success of Hayabusa, which in gathered surface dust from an asteroid and returned to Earth in 2010.
