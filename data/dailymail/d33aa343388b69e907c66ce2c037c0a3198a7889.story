The owner of a London bookshop has become the hero of hundreds of JK Rowling fans after he snapped up signed copies of her first detective novel.

The Cuckoo’s Calling by Robert Galbraith is topping best-seller lists across the globe since it was revealed that Galbraith is a pseudonym for the Harry Potter author, and first editions sell for more than £1,000 each.

Shopkeeper David Headley bought 250 signed copies of the book before the reveal – but instead of making a fortune, he has sold them all at face value: £16.99.

Mystery unveiled: JK Rowling signed 250 first edition copies of The Cuckoo's Calling as 'Robert Galbraith'

The owner of Goldsboro Books, which specialises in signed first editions, ordered the copies signed by the author, before knowing anything about ‘his’ true identity.

Mr Headley had been tipped off about The Cuckoo’s Calling by a publishing friend and, upon being sent a manuscript copy, asked for signed copies of the book.

Although he was told the author’s name was a pseudonym, he had no clue that it was Rowling.

‘I did ask if the author really was a first timer as it seemed, well, too good,’ he told The Sunday Times.

‘He assured me the writer was a first time detective writer. This of course is factually correct.’

Out of stock: Since the revelation that JK Rowling is the author of Teh Cuckoo's Calling, Goldsboro Books has sold all the remaining copies - at the £16.99 cover price

Upsell: One of the signed copies from Goldsboro was sold on eBay for over £1,750 and unsigned copies go for around £1,000

JK Rowling was exposed as the author of The Cuckoo’s Calling by the wife of one of her lawyers.

The publisher of The Cuckoo’s Calling had claimed it was written by a former plain clothes Royal Military Police investigator using the pen-name of Galbraith.

However, several online literary sleuth’s began questioning similarities between Rowling and Galbraith as well as noting how well the ‘male’ author had described women’s clothes.

Rowling was exposed after Jude Callegari, a mother-of-two posted a message on Twitter saying it JK Rowling, 47, was the real author.

She had been told by Chris Gossage, a partner in Rowling’s legal firm Russells Solicitors, who told Callegari, his wife’s best friend, in a private conversation.

JK Rowling released a statement saying
it had ‘not been pleasant’ to spend days wondering how a woman unknown 
to her could expose a secret ‘that many of my oldest friends did not 
know.’

Finished copies of The Cuckoo's Calling come off the print line today at Clays Ltd in Bungay, Suffolk

The novel, The Cuckoo's Calling, which was released in April, tells the story of Cormoran Strike, a war veteran turned private eye, who is investigating the death of a model

She added: ‘To say 
that I am disappointed is an understatement. I had assumed that I could 
expect total confidentiality from Russells, a reputable professional 
firm, and I feel very angry that my trust turned out to be misplaced.’

Russells Solicitors have since apologised.

One
of the signed copies sold in the central London bookshop has been put 
up on eBay, with bids of £1,750 already placed, and even unsigned first 
editions go for around £1,000 on the auction site.

Since the news broke, Mr Headley has sold his remaining 120 copies – but refused to put the price up over £17.

He has kept four copies for himself and his staff: ‘And I am not selling mine, despite the price. It will be with me forever.’
