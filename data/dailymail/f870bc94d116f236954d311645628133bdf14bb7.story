For large chunks of a Champions League game that Manchester City pretty much had to win, this place was a ghost town.

These should be special times, watching the champions at the Etihad and getting behind their team in the elite level of European football.

At times against CSKA Moscow, the atmosphere here was seriously eerie. It is not just City because other stadiums are affected, too.

The loudest noise at the Etihad on Wednesday came in the form of pre-match fireworks on Bonfire Night

Last weekend Jose Mourinho had a pop at Chelsea fans because he felt that complacency had set in after their impressive start to the season on all fronts.

Here, in a Champions League group game, it felt like the the energy is being sucked out of one of the best stadiums in football. City need to revisit the past, to bring back the days when the fans in the Kippax Stand or Platt Lane End were some of the most passionate in the country.

For large chunks of this Group E fixture - a game City really needed to win - this place was felt deserted. Without any away supporters, banned because CSKA Moscow were found guilty of racial abuse last season, the Etihad barely got above a murmur.

To their credit, a band of City supporters in the lower their of the East Stand did their bit, but this club needs more. Much more. You would have thought that the two-for-the-price-of-one offer on tickets would caused a bit more of a stir, but it didn’t make the blind bit of difference.

In the end, sadly, it wasn’t even a sell-out.

The atmosphere at Maine Road was special, one of the best in the country... but the Etihad feels sterile

Some CSKA Moscow fans made their way into the ground despite being banned for the match

The team needs to play their part because they pass for the sake of passing at times. Bayern Munich, when they were coached by Louis van Gaal, got rid of him for that reason.

Supporters want to see drive, passion and enthusiasm, to be on the edge of their seats when Yaya Toure, Jesus Navas or Sergio Aguero are on the ball

Instead Manuel Pellegrini’s team is patient for the sake of being patient.

Perhaps Jose Mourinho, who criticised Chelsea supporters for their failure to get behind the team against QPR at Stamford Bridge last week, went too far.

The fans react to the football in front of them and it is hard to get going when City are so patient in possession.

These are some of the biggest games in City’s history and the club must learn to savour them and create those crackling atmospheres that we associate English football with.

It was sterile here, but it isn’t just City.

The game has changed so much that supporters are being made to wait for what feels like hours on end at times before their teams gets the ball in the box.

Man City conceded an early goal against CSKA Moscow, which didn't help the atmosphere on the night

The performance from the City team affects the way the fans behave, and there was nothing to cheer about

That is the modern a game, a disturbing trend that is affecting football fans who grew up with terrace anthems.

Even before kick-off, when they traditionally belt out Blue Moon, it was forced and without feeling. They need to believe a bit more here.

The Champions League trophy is on City’s radar after all the expenditure over the past few years under Sheikh Mansour and they have to learn to love it.

These group games, the six-match slog before Christmas, still throw up some brilliant matches before the draw for the last 16.

By the end of Tuesday night's game against Arsenal, it felt like Anderlecht fans owned the Emirates

At the Emirates on Tuesday evening, Anderlecht’s 3,000 travelling fans crackled into life the moment they pulled a goal back against Arsene Wenger’s team. By the end it felt like they owned the place.

Perhaps it is time to investigate a ‘singing section’, where the fanatics can congregate on matchday to get behind their team from the stands.

In a few months’ time this stadium will have another tier attached to the lower tier of the South Stand. Maybe it is time to make this the City end.

Without it, this place will soon lose its soul.

Watching your team play in the Champions League should be special

It isn't a problem exclusive to Manchester City, it is the same everywhere
