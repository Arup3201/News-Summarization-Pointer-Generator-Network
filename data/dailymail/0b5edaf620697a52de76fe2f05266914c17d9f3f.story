The convicted killer featured on the popular 'Serial' podcast filed a brief Monday with the Maryland Court of Special Appeals stating the case for why his conviction should be overturned.

Adnan Syed, 34, was convicted of strangling his high school sweetheart Hae Min Lee in 1999 and has been serving a life sentence since 2000. 

He was 17 at the time of Lee's death.  

The lawyer for Syed is arguing his client should be granted a new trial because his former attorney, Christina Gutierrez, made mistakes that were 'deeper than the typical error or omission'.

Adnan Syed, the subject of Serial, was convicted of strangling his high school sweetheart Hae Min Lee in 1999

Syed, who was 17 at the time of Lee's (right) death, has been serving a life sentence since 2000 and is now 34

Syed's new lawyer Justin Brown claims Gutierrez failed to interview an alibi witness and never inquired about the possibility of a plea deal.

Gutierrez, who was disbarred by consent after questions arose about her handling of client funds, died 12 years ago amid legal and health problems, the Baltimore Sun reported. 

In the filing, Brown wrote: 'The errors by trial counsel were of such a fundamental nature that Syed must be given a new trial.

'The circumstances here are worse than the circumstances of any other case in which a court has found ineffective assistance of counsel relating to an alibi issue.'

The basis of Syed's appeal is that Gutierrez failed to interview Asia McClain, a student at Syed's school who said she was with him in the library at the approximate time of Lee's death. 

McClain had written to Syed after his arrest offering to speak with investigators and his attorney. 

In her letters, McClain also mentioned two other witnesses who said they saw Syed at the library. 

Gutierrez never interviewed McClain nor called her as a witness.

Syed's lawyer filed a brief with the Maryland Court of Special Appeals arguing for his conviction to be tossed

Brown wrote in the 31-page filing: 'It is hard to imagine that Gutierrez could have done anything worse than failing to pick up the phone and call Syed's witness.'

He also argues Gutierrez told Syed that prosecutors would not offer him a plea deal, but never inquired if one was even on the table. 

The appeals attorney wrote: 'It not only violates something fundamental to the trial process, but it violates the duty of loyalty that is at the heart of attorney-client relationship.

'His lawyer effectively stopped representing him.'

Serial raised questions about the integrity of the case against Syed, the fairness of the trial and his guilt.

The 12-episode podcast, which was hosted by This American Life producer Sarah Koenig, was downloaded more than 40 million times. 

The Court of Special Appeals agreed to hear Syed's appeal in February after two unsuccessful attempts.

The attorney general's office, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment Monday.

Oral arguments are expected to be scheduled for June
