New mystery surrounds Vladimir Putin's elder daughter Maria after the Russia embassy in London strongly denied a widely-used picture was her.

The diplomatic intervention came after stories appeared that she and her Dutch partner had fled their home near The Hague after criticism of her father over his support for pro-Moscow rebels in Ukraine accused of the shooting down of flight MH17.

Earlier there was a call for her to be deported from the Netherlands where she is reported to live with her Dutch partner Jorrit Faassen, 34, an executive for a Russian consultancy firm.

A picture purporting to be Maria, 29, showed her walking next to her parents in Moscow but embassy press secretary Alexei Dobrinsky has strongly denied it was her

A picture purporting to be Maria, 29, showed her walking next to her parents in Moscow but embassy press secretary Alexei Dobrinsky accused the media of a lack of professionalism, and insisted the image showed a participant of a Putin meeting with young people during an election campaign.

Bloggers in Moscow yesterday identified the woman as lawyer DariaÂ  Zakharova, 34, the head of a department at RozMolodezh, a state youth agency.

One said that Zakharova would be 'very surprised to find out whose daughter she has suddenly become'.

She was currently on maternity leave after giving birth in January, it was claimed.

Questions were also raised in Moscow in recent days over another picture of a woman in a park who it was claimed was Maria Putin amid some claims this image showed a model

While the picture has been used all around the world, blogger Teh-Nomad insisted she 'is not at all Putin's daughter'.

Denying
 the image showed the president's elder child, the Russian envoy neither
 provided a correct picture nor challenged that she lived in Holland 
with her partner.

Use of the photograph was 'hostile' and 
'arouses our indignation - it just goes beyond the pale,' said the 
spokesman in a report carried by state-owned RIA Novosti news agency.

The spokesman warned against 'spinning 
the facts about our country and its policy', a comment made as relations
 between Russia and the West have sunk to a low point since the end of 
the Cold War over the Ukraine crisis and the downing of the aircraft.

Questions were also raised in Moscow in recent days over another picture of a woman in a park who it was claimed was Maria Putin amid some claims this image showed a model.

Putin - who is divorced from Maria's mother Lyudmila - jealously guards his family's private life. The couple have another daughter, Ekaterina, 28.

The Kremlin leader has not allowed his daughters to be photographed in public since becoming president for the first time 14 years ago.

Police last week stepped up surveillance outside the Dutch apartment after she became the target of threats on Twitter and messages on web forums called on people to protest outside the luxury riverside penthouse in Voorschoten.

Of the 298 deaths on the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, 193 were from Holland.

Locals said the couple had not been seen in the area since Flight MH17 was brought down ten days ago.

The mayor of the city of Hilversum, Pieter Broertjes, called for Ms Putin to be deported from the country in a radio interview.

He later apologised for his comments, saying the demands were 'not wise' but 'stemmed from a feeling of helplessness that many will recognise'.
