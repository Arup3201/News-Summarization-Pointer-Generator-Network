From Beyonce's maple syrup and lemon fast to Mariah Carey's purple food only regime, the A-list is no stranger to bizarre fad diets.

But actress Alice Eve appears to have taken Hollywood dieting to the next level, admitting to eating nothing but spinach in a bid to slim down for her role as Dr Carol Marcus in Star Trek: Into Darkness.

Asked how she prepared for the part, the English actress said: 'The only thing I can reveal is that I haven't eaten much apart from spinach for weeks.'

Hungry? Eve, 31, revealed that she has been existing on spinach and little else for the last five months. Here is pictured in February of this year at left

Love interest: Eve appears in the franchise as Dr Carol Marcus - the girlfriend of Chris Pine's Captain Kirk

'You've got to look as if you can hold your own on the Enterprise, and that means you've got to be in proper fighting shape,' she added in an interview with the Telegraph's Seven magazine.

Eve, 31, is the daughter of veteran actor Trevor Eve, who is best known for his role as surly Superintendent Peter Boyd in BBC drama, Waking The Dead, and his actress wife, Sharon Maughan.

Although Eve has already enjoyed roles in Men In Black 3, Sex And The City 2 and She's Out Of My League among others, it is her new Star Trek role that is set to propel her onto the A-list.

Despite keeping details of her role firmly under wraps, her character is believed to be the new love interest for Chris Pine's Captain Kirk.

While Eve's spinach-only diet is one of the more extreme examples of a Hollywood food fad, it is far from being the only one.

Fad: Mariah Carey has been known to eat only purple food while Beyonce is a fan of the maple syrup diet

Currently popular is the 'green cleanse' championed by Madonna's former personal trainer, Tracey Anderson, which involves guzzling a 'power juice' made from kale, spinach, beetroot and apple puree at breakfast.

Anderson, who is also credited with transforming Gwyneth Paltrow's exercise and eating regime,  recommends sipping coconut water before working out.

'If you eat a bagel or spaghetti before working out, you will not burn as much fat,' she reveals.

'Substitute something like two scoops of protein powder with half water and half coconut water for that bagel, and you’ve got a win-win.

'Fat is broken down faster, and you can still go the distance to create real and lasting results.'
