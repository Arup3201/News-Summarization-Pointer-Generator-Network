Looks can be deceiving for this recently sold mansion of a Flight Centre co-founder.

While the exterior shows a classical period house, the chic interior and stunning rear of the property are complete with modern finishes.

This comes just two weeks after Geoff Harris purchased a $12 million opulent heritage property in the same Melbourne surburb.

Harris sold his Albert Park abode, south of Melbourne, for $5,808,000. The former vice-president of AFL club Hawthorn bought the tri-level home in Melbourne's most expensive suburb for $4.9 million in 2011, the Property Observer reports.

The five-bedroom mansion on Kerferd Road was initially listed for $5.95 million but was sold for slightly lower to Bruce Crome. Features of the property include a classic facade, modern and spacious interior and a pool.

Harris' new prized possession, Hollyford, was built in 1873 and was the surburb's first sale over $10 million.

The heritage residence was modelled on 'the English idea of houses clustered around its central landscaped gardens', the Property Observer reports.

It is believed David Wood's Hockingstuart was the selling agency for both properties.

Harris, 62, was listed on the latest BRW rich list with an estimated worth of $975 million.

He founded the travel agency business with Graham Turner and Bill James in the early 1970s.

Their business started in London with European bus tours and now operates in 11 countries and 2500 stores, BRW reports.

Another standout feature of the home is its modern kitchen
