Claire Allnutt died when a dirty drip, which was administering antibiotics, was left in her arm for four days, triggering deadly blood poisoning

A woman who was recovering from a flesh-eating bug died in hospital due to the NHS's failure to provide a full service at weekend, her parents have claimed.

Claire Allnutt had been in hospital for two months where she was being treated for the infection necrotising fasciitis.

The 28-year-old died when a dirty drip, which was administering antibiotics, was left in her arm for four days, triggering deadly blood poisoning.

An inquest heard a junior doctors at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital spotted fungal spores in the tube carrying the drugs to Miss Allnutt's arm on a Friday.

But it was not removed until the following Tuesday, the coroner was told.

Observation notes showed Miss Allnutt's condition worsened over the weekend, but medics decided to monitor her and no action was taken until the Tuesday. 

By that time, life-threatening blood poisoning had set in. Miss Allnutt suffered several heart attacks before she passed away in the early hours of the following morning. 

A coroner heard the 28-year-old, who had learning difficulties, had initially refused to consent to the tube being withdrawn because she had a phobia of needles.

The inquest was told Miss Allnutt's condition worsened over the weekend, but senior sister Julie Caunt told the court there 'was never a sense of urgency' about her treatment.

Miss Allnutt's temperature had risen to 39C over the weekend and her blood pressure had decreased to a worrying level.

The coroner said part of the issue was that the infection was spotted on a Friday which he said was the 'worst time for this to happen'.

Medical director Dr Mark Patten, from Luton & Dunstable Hospital, told the hearing Ms Allnutt's death 'led to a lot of soul searching at the hospital about the prevention of infection'.

But her family questioned why a specially-trained nurse for patients with special needs, who had helped Miss Allnutt in the past, was not called.

Her parents added they were not contacted about her deteriorating condition - and said the tube should have been removed sooner.

After the inquest her father Richard Allnutt, 61, a site manager, accused the NHS of only working a five day week and said the family was considering legal action.

He said: 'It is clear to us that the NHS only seems to work Monday to Friday.

'On the Friday it was known that the line had to be removed, but it wasn't until the following Tuesday that it happened.'

He added: 'It was extremely hard to hear all the details of it in court today and I am amazed that so many people were involved.

Miss Allnut's mother Ann, 57, a hospital ward clerk, said: 'It was three months of torment for us.

'We saw her recovering and we thought there was light at the end of the tunnel - but then she dies from something that was completely avoidable.

'It is heartbreaking for us a family.' 

Bedfordshire and Luton coroner Tom Osborne said medical staff failed to communicate with each other effectively. 

He said: 'On January 24 a PICC line became infected and microbiologists advised it should be removed.

An inquest heard a junior doctors at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital spotted fungal spores in the tube carrying the drugs to Miss Allnutt's arm on a Friday. But it was not removed until the following Tuesday

'There was a failure to remove the the line until January 28, but by then she had developed sepsis.

'There was also a failure in monitoring the deterioration of the condition.'

He added: 'What had happened here is a clear indication you can have ipads and modern technology and super drugs.

'But at the end of the day medicine is not about that, it's about medication.'

The hospital has admitted failing Miss Allnutt and bosses said they have since implemented changes.

Microbiologists at the hospital will now speak directly to consultants, rather than junior doctors when discussing infections.

The hospital has also raised awareness of sepsis and how to monitor it more carefully.

Nurses are now required to record the condition of drip lines in patients daily to avoid the infection becoming fatal.

A spokesman for Luton and Dunstable Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We have given an unreserved apology to Claire Allnutt's family following her tragic death last January.

'Since then, the hospital has carried out a thorough investigation to understand the reasons for Claire's untimely death and to assist the Coroner's inquest.

'The hospital has learned from the events that occurred prior to Claire's death and has introduced a number of changes in practice, which have since been implemented and are being constantly monitored and evaluated.'

Miss Allnutt, from Luton, Bedfordshire, leaves her partner David Stickley, 32.
