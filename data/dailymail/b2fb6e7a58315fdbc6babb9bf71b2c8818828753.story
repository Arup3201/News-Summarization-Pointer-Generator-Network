Meet the world's craftiest stray dog who has somehow managed to evade animal catchers an incredible 92 times.

LBD (short for Lucky Black Dog) as he has been dubbed, has become the thorn in the side of Fayetteville Animal Services department in Arkansas who he loves to embarrass at any opportunity.

Every time officers get close to capturing him, he manages to give them the slip before popping up again somewhere else a few days later.

On one occasion he even managed to dodge their tranquiliser darts before making an escape.

'He’s infamous, that’s for sure,' Tony Rankin of Fayetteville Animal Services told wcvb.com.

'It’s very frustrating, because we’re hired to do a job and that job is to pick up loose animals,' Rankin said.

'It’s part of that job, anyway. When you feel that you can’t fulfill those job requirements, you feel like you haven’t gotten your job done.'

Some locals and dog owners belive LBD has become a little too fearless and that it was now time to get off the streets once and for all.

'He finds friends and he runs around with friends,' One local, Joan Threet told wcvb.com.

'Even if I’m walking my dog, he’ll come up and harass my dog. He’s brazen.'
