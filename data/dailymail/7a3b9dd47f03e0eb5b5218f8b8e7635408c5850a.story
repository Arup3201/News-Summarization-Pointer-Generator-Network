Danny Welbeck left the Emirates Stadium with the signed match-ball from Arsenal’s 4-1 win against Galatasaray despite admitting he forgot to claim it at the final whistle.

In his post-match television interview, the hat-trick hero confessed it was so long since his last treble that the protocol had escaped him.

'I forgot the match ball, didn’t I? But I’ll get it after,' said Welbeck, and he soon had the souvenir tucked under his arm. 'My last hat-trick was probably for Manchester United reserves. This is the first of my professional career.'

Danny Welbeck became the third Arsenal player to score a Champions League hat-trick.

Predictably, Thierry Henry is another, against Roma in 2002, but even Gunners fans may struggle to name the other one.

It is the much-maligned Nicklas Bendtner, who hit three against Porto in 2010.

He became only the sixth Englishman to score a hat-trick in the Champions League and with four Arsenal goals for the season has already overtaken his 2014 total for Manchester United.

His third of the night, seven minutes into the second half, brought Arsene Wenger to his feet as the manager celebrated his 18th anniversary of joining Arsenal with an emphatic win to put them second in Champions League Group D.

The victory could not spoiled by a red-card for goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, for a foul which allowed Burak Yilmaz to score Galatasaray’s consolation goal from the penalty spot. Alexis Sanchez scored the other for the Gunners.

'I’m playing up front trying to score goals and get opportunities and tonight it paid off and I got the three goals,' said Welbeck. 'The manager has shown a lot of faith in me and I’m delighted to pay him back. He has given me a chance to play football up front in my preferred position and I’m going to do everything I can to make sure that he is happy.'

Asked for his pick of the three, he said: 'The last one I think, because I was stretching for it. I’ve been in that position a few times and chipped the keeper and sometimes it goes in and sometimes it doesn’t. Today I've seen him coming him out and he slid in.

'We’ve set the benchmark now and we have really got to try and grow on that win. From now on we want to get three points in every game.'

Welbeck became the sixth Englishman to score a Champions League hat-trick. The others are:

Wayne Rooney, Michael Owen, Andy Cole, Alan Shearer and Mike Newell 

Wenger hailed Welbeck’s contribution. 'The potential is there and hopefully this hat-trick will help him to gain confidence,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We had good pace and good movements and our finishing was good and Danny was on the end of a few.

'It helps always to know that you have a good chance to play the next game. His link up play is good as well his work-rate and his attitude is positive. He’s a team player, not only a finisher. He wants to help the team.

'I’ve learnt he’s a good finisher. I believe technically he’s very sound. That was a surprise, he’s technically clean and that he’s a good passer of the ball. I didn’t know he was so quick, honestly. I knew he was quick. But he can be electric when he starts.'
