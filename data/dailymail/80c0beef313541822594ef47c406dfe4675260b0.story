The days of awkwardly cutting an oval egg into odd-shaped slices to make it fit into a sandwich is now over.

A kitchen gadget has been invented that squashes the egg into a square, meaning it can be chopped more easily and placed into sandwiches, burgers and onto salads.

The simple device simply squashes the egg, with the help of a small drop of oil, to change it from an oval into a cube.

A clever gadget has been invented to solve the age-old problem of fitting slices of round egg in a square sandwich. For generations people have been chopping up circular pieces of egg and layering them on bread but being forced to leave gaps at the corners. But this device turns the oval snack into a cube (shown)

A Chicago-based entreprenuer has come up with something else worth getting egg-cited about after inventing a gadget that scrambles an egg inside its own shell.

The £10 ($17) contraption named Goose gently spins the egg, blending the yolk and the white without cracking the shell itself.

The already-scrambled egg can then be soft or hard boiled - and its creator, Geraint Krumpe, claims the ingenious method makes them taste far better than regular eggs.

The contraption, known as the Egg-Q-ber, is a jar in which hard-boiled eggs are placed and squashed into the new shape.

A user simply has to cook their egg, peel off the shell, place it in the container and screw on the lid, which forces it into a cube.

After one minute the egg will have moulded to a cube shape and can be chopped up ready to eat.

The square slices can then fit to the exact shape of a sandwich.

The £4.99 ($8.50) gadget is 3.5 inches by 2.5 inches (8.9cm by 11.4cm) in size and is made by Kidult.

Robert Lawson, 33, is from Harrogate, Yorkshire and is the owner of Kidult, who manufacture the Egg-Q-Ber.

The contraption, known as the Egg-Q-Ber, is a jar in which hard-boiled eggs are placed and squashed into the new shape. A user simply has to cook their egg, peel off the shell, place it in the container with a dash of oil, and screw on the lid to get the sandwich-friendly square eggs (shown)

He said: 'The concept was conceived in Japan by a man named Masashi Nakagawa and his agent then approached Kidult.

'We
 then designed, sourced, manufactured and distributed it. The Egg-Q-Ber 
is something that started as a novelty but it's also practical and 
people enjoy using it.

'It stops the egg rolling around on the plate and it makes the correct shapes for sandwiches.'

Ben
 Redhead, head of buying for Firebox who is stocking the product, added:
 'Boiled eggs have been the bane of picnics and packed lunches the world
 over due to their completely illogical shape.

To use the Egg Q-ber device the egg must first be hard boiled (left) before being placed inside with a bit of oil and closing the lid (right)

The egg must be kept inside with the lid closed (left) for one minute. When it is taken out it will have been moulded into a cube shape

'Now we’ve discovered the Egg-Q-Ber, we’ve finally brought a little discipline to the dinner plate and can create perfectly uniform sandwich coverage too.

'All someone needs to do is hard boil their egg and peel off the shell, pop it in the Egg-Q-Ber, wait for a minute and it will be in a cube shape.

'The product proves very popular in the summer months when people tend to eat more salads and sandwiches.

'People have said they were sceptical at first but found the results were actually really good, and that their friends are all wanting them now.'
