A father-to-be was murdered by a drunk teenager who he escorted home - robbing him of the chance to meet his newborn child.

Michael Lee Emmett, 29, walked the 16-year-old to his parents' house because he had been drinking, but the boy then stabbed him.

The teenager, who cannot be named until a judge lifts reporting restrictions, had grabbed a knife from inside the house and the 29-year-old father-of-three suffered a deep wound to his liver and died a month later in a coma in hospital.

Tragedy: Michael Lee Emmett, 29, walked his 16-year-old killer home before the boy stabbed him and left him in a coma. Days before his death his daughter Lola-Grace was born to partner Natalie, but he never met her

Family man: Mr Emmett, pictured with Natalie and two sons Logan and Riley, walked his teenage killer home because he was drunk but the boy then stabbed him

His daughter Lola-Grace was born just days before he died - but he never woke to see his baby.

His heartbroken partner of 13 years, Natalie Preece, took her to hospital Mr Emmett lay unconscious in his bed but he never came around again.

Bereft: Ms Preece, pictured outside court, said the murder 'has robbed us of nearly everything we had that made us such a happy family'

Nurses allowed Ms Preece to lay Lola-Grace in his arms so she could take a picture of father and daughter together. 

The teenager - who was on an ASBO at the time - today admitted murder and is facing life in prison. He will be sentenced at a later date after a psychiatric assessment.

Prosecutor James Wilson said: 'The attack took place shortly after MicheaL Lee and his friend John Williams had tried to walk him home from the pub.

'They intervened after he had been abusive and aggressive.'

Demolition worker Mr Emmett had seen the boy at the Stone House pub in Cefn Forest, near Blackwood, South Wales, being abusive to a woman.

Cardiff Crown Court heard how they told him not to speak to women like that and a scuffle had broken out.

The pair then tried to escort the drunken teenager to his family home saying: 'We'll see what your dad has to say about this.'

But when they arrived, the boy ran inside and 30 seconds later emerged with a kitchen knife which he used to attack both men.

Mr Emmett died of his injuries after being transferred to a specialist liver intensive care unit at Kings College Hospital in London.

The father of three - who had twin sons - died after complications following a liver transplant.

In a victim impact statement Natalie said: 'Losing Micheal Lee has affected every single part of my life.

'What has happened has robbed us of nearly everything we had that made us such a happy family.

'Since the boy took away my soul mate my whole life has been devastated in every way.

'Michael Lee was lying in hospital for 28 days, he was in agony this whole time, not knowing whether he would live or die.

'I had to sit with him putting on a brave face when inside I was sickened by what had been done to the man I loved the most.

'He kept asking what the date was - counting down the days until our daughter was born.

'But even that was taken away from us.

Heartbreaking: His heartbroken partner of 13 years, Natalie Preece, together left, took their daughter to his hospital bedside where he lay unconscious in his bed but he never came around

'The only photo they had together was taken just before Michael Lee died.

'The nurses let me take Lola into his room and rearrange Michae Kee's arms around her when he was braindead.

'It's not something anyone should have to do.

'Making the decision to turn off his life support broke my heart. No words can explain how painful that was.'

The teenager admitted murder, wounding with intent, assaulting a police offer and breaching his ASBO.

The sentence was adjourned for the preparation of a psychiatric report.

Judge Mrs Nicola Davies apologised to the family who will have to wait for 'some kind of finality' before deciding on the minimum term for his life sentence.
