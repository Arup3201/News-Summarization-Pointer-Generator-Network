This is the moment police officers surfed Facebook and a sex website while a man in their care died in a cell just metres away from them.

Lloyd Butler, 39, died of a cardiac arrest while being detained at Stechford police station in the West Midlands on August 4 2010, an inquest decided   yesterday.

The CCTV footage shows the officers responsible for him gathered around a computer while they were supposed to be keeping a constant   watch on him.

'Unacceptable': Police officers surfed Facebook and a sex website while a man in their care had died in a cell just metres away from them

A report published by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) highlighted an alarming number of mistakes and 'unacceptable behaviour' by   officers in the tragic case.

It also said custody sergeant Mark Albutt faked records to make it appear officers were checking on Mr Butler more often than they did.

The review was published after an inquest saw footage showing officers laughing, joking and swearing.

The jury was also told thatÂ PC Dean Woodcock made personal phonecalls, and officers surfed inappropriate websites, including one where 'women were offering sex'.

IPCC Associate Commissioner Guido Liguori, who published the report, said: 'The indifferent treatment of Mr Butler by officers and staff of West   Midlands Police showed a disregard for both the stated procedures of detention and also for human decency.

'The care given to Mr Butler fell well short of what was expected from when he was arrested to the moment he sadly died.

'Instead of taking Mr Butler to hospital officers kept him in a police cell and instead of helping him, PC Woodcock and DEO Wall mocked him.

'In addition to the failure to care properly for Mr Butler, this was a worrying case highlighted by the findings from our investigation that PS Albutt   deliberately recorded incorrect information in the custody record and failed to adequately monitor Mr Butler, PC Woodcock preferring instead to surf   the internet and make personal calls.

'Such actions are not what I would expect to see from the police officers and staff.'

Mr Butler collapsed at the police station after being arrested for appearing to be drunk and incapable.

Delivering the verdict that Mr Butler's cardiac arrest had been caused by underlying alcohol problems the jury said the risk assessment was inadequate.

They also said 15-minute visits were not carried out on time and a nurse was late to attend to him.

The chairman said: 'On his arrival at custody, Mr Butler wasn't capable and, according to policies in place he should not have been detained in   custody, he should have been taken to hospital.

'It is the findings of the jury that, had Mr Butler been on a monitor in A&E at the time of his heart attack, the probability is that he more likely   would have survived.'

PC Woodcock, who arrested Mr Butler and was later tasked with monitoring him, was found guilty of misconduct and had to undergo further training and development.

Sgt Albutt was found guilty of gross misconduct and handed a final written warning.

Lloyd's devastated mother, Janet, said her son would still be alive if West Midlands Police officers had 'done their job'.

Speaking outside the court, she added: 'I hate to think another family has to suffer the way we did and still are - it affects you for the rest of your   life.

'I was satisfied with the inquest process because it brought out the truth - the truth about West Midlands Police and the officers who dealt with my   son.

'Their behaviour was an absolute disgrace. They failed Lloyd miserably in their duty of care to him and I feel they assisted in his death.

'It's very clear from the evidence we've seen over the last ten days that officers were not carrying out procedures.

'If they had, my son would still be alive today.'

Birmingham coroner Louise Hunt said a 'change of culture' was needed in the force as she prepared to submit her report to prevent future deaths.

She added: 'I remain concerned essentially about the conduct in custody suites.

'I appreciate a custody suite is a very difficult environment to work in but you have very vulnerable people coming in.'

More CCTV played at the inquest showed officers dragging Mr Butler out of a police van by his legs, staggering around his cell and hitting his head   against the wall.

Responding to the inquest verdict and the IPCC report, assistant chief constable Gary Cann said: 'The jury at Birmingham Coroner's Court has found   officers failed to carry out an adequate risk assessment when arresting Mr Butler, placing him in custody instead of taking him to hospital.

'They also found that, once in custody, proper checks were not adequately carried out and visits were not maintained on schedule.

'We do not underestimate the impact the death of Lloyd Butler has had on his family and friends and the force extends its sincere condolences.

'On behalf of the force, I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to Lloyd Butler's family.'
