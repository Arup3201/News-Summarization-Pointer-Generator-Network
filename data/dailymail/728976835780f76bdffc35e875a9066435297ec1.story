In a letter to a friend, W. Martin Jones (right) detailed the moment Abraham Lincoln (left) was assassinated. The letter is now set to go on sale 150 years after the night the former president was shot in a theatre

Mr Jones wrote the letter to Captain H. Bowen 10 days after the assassination at Ford's Theatre on April 14

He describes how the theatre had been packed out amid rumours Lincoln might be attending the performance, and how cheers erupted when he arrived.

He then recalls the moment a shot rang out around the theatre and the chaos that ensued when the audience realised Lincoln had been murdered by actor John Wilkes-Booth.

In a letter to a friend, Captain H. Bowen, written 10 days after the assassination, Mr Jones wrote about the 'recent assassination of out late illustrious chief magistrates, which has cast a gloom over the land'.

Mr Jones describes actor John Wilkes Booth as a 'man with face of livid whiteness'

He said: 'The theatre was well filled, and the play opened soon after eight o'clock.

'I occupied a front seat in the first section from the private box fitted up for the Presidential company.

'In the middle of the first scene of the first act, the attention of the actors and audience was attracted by the rustling of silk and other movements to the rear of the dress circle.

'The tall and manly form of President Lincoln greeted the anxious eyes of the assembly. Cheer upon cheer welcomed him as he passed to the entrance of his box.'

'He paused a moment to gratify those whose cheers seemed to die away, and then followed Mrs. Lincoln into the box, and was shut from the view of most of the assembly.

'The President, as usual with him, had no guard - except that which in the greatness and goodness of his heart he deemed sufficient.' 

He added: 'The play went 'smoothly on,' and the attention of the audience became so engrossed in it that little thought was given to other subjects.

'All was still. Sharp and clear, amid the silence that reigned in that vast theatre, sounded the report of a pistol. All eyes were turned whence came the unwelcome noise.

'A thousand thoughts flashed through my mind in an instant. This was a comedy not a tragedy, why this sound of fire arms? There must be a mistake. 

'The shot first appeared to me, in the position which I was occupying, as having been made behind the scenes - to the right of the audience. 

'It was but an instant, and the slim form of a man with face of livid whiteness, stopped in front of the box in which was seated the President.

The former president had attended Ford's Theatre on the night of April 14, 1865, to see a performance of Our American Cousin. Abraham Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington D.C.

'The words 'Sic Semper Tyrannis' was hissed between compressed lips. Another instant and the form had vaulted over the balustrade and upon the stage below - a distance of over twelve feet.

'The words 'The President' and 'Assassination' were murmured by persons in the assembly just as the form struck the stage.

'Turning one ghastly look upon the awe stricken people before it, with a long glittering dagger raised high above its head and with rapid strides, it disappeared behind the scenes.

'In an instant the stage was filled with actors and audience.

'A surgeon immediately clambered or was lifted from the stage to the box.

'Laura Keene stepped forward and endeavoured to restore quiet, but suddenly, as if seized with a new thought, she rushed to the President's box, and taking the head of the murdered man in her lap, did what she could to bring back the life that was fast passing away.

'This in the public theatre of Washington the life blood of the illustrious Chief Magistrate of the Nation stained the robe of an actress. 

'The theatre was soon after cleared of people, and the President removed to a private house on the opposite side of the street.'

He then recounts Lewis Payne's attack on Secretary of State Seward and the filling of the streets with troops. 'on the morning of Saturday, April 15, the slow and solemn tolling of the church bells in the city, announced that "Abraham Lincoln is dead!"'

Mr Jones writes: 'Sharp and clear, amid the silence that reigned in that vast theatre, sounded the report of a pistol'

'The words 'The President' and 'Assassination' were murmured by persons in the assembly just as the form struck the stage'

He says Laura Keene rushed to the President's box, and 'taking the head of the murdered man in her lap, did what she could to bring back the life that was fast passing away'

Experts say the letter is the finest and most detailed description of the assassination in existence.

It is being sold for the first time in 30 years by Donald P. Dow, an American collector who specialized in Abraham Lincoln memorabilia.

The 11-page letter is set to fetch $8,000 (around £5,000) when it is sold at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas later this week.

Don Ackerman, from Heritage Auctions, said: 'This letter was written 10 days after the assassination by a clerk called W. Martin Jones who was completely unknown before the shooting.

'His report of the event basically became his one claim to fame.

'It is by far the finest, most detailed account of the killing known to exist.

'The most amazing thing about the account is that it comes directly from the hand of someone who was actually there in the theatre when Booth killed Lincoln.

'The letter is so well-written and descriptive that you almost feel like you're there in the theatre.'

Tom Slater, director of Americana at Heritage, added: 'Donald P. Dow was a meticulous collector who obtained many of his pieces 20 to 30 years ago, and this auction marks the first time in a generation that collectors have seen these items.

'Considering Mr Dow's effort to document the assassination and the nation's reaction, it's fitting the collection is offered during its sesquicentennial year.'
