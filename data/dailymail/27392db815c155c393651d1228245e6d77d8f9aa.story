Suspended: Detroit police officer Deon Nunlee has been charged with raping a woman who called 911

A Detroit police officer is accused of raping a woman who had called 911 to report being assaulted by her boyfriend.

Deon Nunlee, 39, was arraigned on Friday on second-degree criminal sexual conduct, assault and misconduct charges, according to the Wayne County prosecutor's office.

Prosecutors said Nunlee and his partner responded to a domestic disturbance complaint at a home on Detroit's northwest side about 3am on October 30.

A 31-year-old woman told investigators that after the police arrived she was taken to an upstairs bedroom by one officer while the other remained downstairs with her boyfriend.

The woman said she was sexually assaulted in the bedroom by the officer, who told her he would return later that morning, prosecutors said.

DNA evidence connected Nunlee to the sexual assault, Police Chief James Craig said on Friday afternoon.

'This is the type of misconduct that should never happen,' Craig said. 'This does not reflect the work the Detroit Police Department does each and every day.'

'I would go out and say that I think the majority of the public has a great deal of confidence and faith in this police department,' Craig added.

'And people should never lose sight that when we hire police officers we hire from the community, and you all know that there's people in our community that commit crimes. They make bad choices, make bad decisions, and police officers are no different.'

Nunlee has been with the police force since 2008. When the woman made her accusations on October 31, he was put on desk duty.

On February 10, DNA collected in a rape kit was linked to Nunlee, who was then suspended without pay, Fox 2 reported.

He remains suspended without pay and faces an April 17 preliminary examination.

Nunlee was not the only Detroit officer to appear on the wrong side of a courtroom in recent days.

Suspended officer Dana Bond was arraigned on Tuesday on charges of failing stop at an injury accident, failing to stop at an accident that caused property damage and driving with a high blood alcohol content.

Authorities said Bond tried to drive away after a crash on Sunday, but struck a snow bank.

Another officer, Johnny Ray Bridges, 46, was charged this week with unlawful imprisonment, assault with intent to do great bodily harm, domestic violence and reckless discharge of a firearm.

A 31-year-old Detroit woman was punched and kicked in the face and body on Tuesday during an argument.

At some point during the argument, a handgun was fired into the air. The woman said she escaped by breaking out a window and fleeing to a nearby restaurant.

Bridges was off duty at the time.
