Brooke always knew she wanted to be a performer. As a child she would sing into her hairbrush in front of the mirror, make music videos of her favourite songs with her two sisters and put on variety shows for visitors to the house.

But growing up in the small mining town of Biloela in central Queensland, her dream never seemed like it could become reality. So after school Brooke, 25, who did not wish to give her surname, studied a Diploma of Beauty Therapy and began working at day spas. She enjoyed her work at first, but when she moved to Gladstone she decided it was time to pursue her passion and so she learnt how to DJ.

'I approached the manager of the local nightclub expressing my interest to learn how to DJ. He was nice enough to let me come in after my day job when the club was closed to use the club's decks and show me the basicsâ€¦ and eventually they let me stay back once the doors had opened and I DJed in front of a crowd for the first time,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Brooke transformed herself to become DJ Brooklyn when she realised her passion was DJing

DJ Brooklyn described herself as a 'shy quiet kid' and a 'country girl' who transforms into a fearless outgoing person when she is onstage

Since then, DJ Brooklyn, as she is now known, has become the resident DJ at Platinum Nightclub on the Gold Coast, toured at nightclubs around the country and performed shows in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, as well as signing with an agency.

DJ Brooklyn has transformed from a shy girl to a fearless performer who describes her sound as 'bounce and big room'.

'I was always the shy quiet kid, even now sitting in a group of friends I am probably the quietest one. It actually takes me a lot of time to feel comfortable around someone and open up,' she said.

'However, when I'm on stage, I'm very outgoing, confident and fearless. I can't really explain it, I have always been like that from my early dancing days.'

Part of finding her confidence has come from finally doing something she loves.

'I used to get really nervous right before going into the booth, but once I play the first track I'm in my zone and the performer in me comes out,' she said.

The 25-year-old has been touring nightclubs around the country and in Asia

Her dream is to  play at some of the world's biggest music festivals and to release some original tracks

Not everyone understands her unorthodox career path.

'My parents just thought it was a hobby at first, but once I started taking it seriously they seemed a bit worried. They would never stop me from going after what I love but I think they would prefer me to have a secure nine to five job,' she said.

But the opportunities presented to her as a DJ have been too good to pass up. In May she performed in front of more than 2,000 people at the H-Artistry Globe Art Of Mixing event in Malaysia.

'It was a super clubbing experience with a massive stage, elevated DJ booth, dancers and an amazing light show. I felt very loved and welcomed over there,' she said.

The DJ is looking forward to continuing to tour across Australia and has ambitions to release her own original track, perform on the main stage at some international festivals and to tour across the USA and Europe.

The 25-year-old would visit a nightclub after work each day to learn the craft
