A prudent pensioner is preparing to celebrate the festive season with the same Christmas tree that he has used for the past 74 years.

Derek Parker was bought the dishevelled 3ft tree by his late mother when he was just three-months-old.

But the artificial tree, made out of wood, wire and green quilled feathers, has lasted so well Derek and wife Sybil have brought it out every Christmas since 1937.

Incredibly, they still use five baubles and the angel that came with the miniature tree more than seven decades ago for decorations today.

The couple have also saved money on their fairy lights as the 20 coloured ones wrapped around the fragile tree are still going strong after 31 years.

The last decorations Mr and Mrs Parker bought for the tree were wooden teddy bears and elephants about 25 years ago.

The tree is so ancient that four years ago a local history museum put it on display.

Every year 74-year-old Mr Parker, a great-grandfather, places the fragile tree on his lounge windowsill and bans any member of his family from touching it in case it falls apart.

Ready to celebrate: Other festive celebrations are not quite as traditional as Mr Parker's as this lights and fireworks display in London's Regent Street shows

After Christmas the couple, from Merriott, near Crewkerne, Somerset, gently wrap the tree in polystyrene, place it in a bag and store it in their loft for safekeeping.

They don't even take off the decorations because they are afraid of wrecking it.

After taking it out of storage for its 75th Christmas, retired lorry driver Derek said: 'Every year I look in the bag its wrapped in to see if its still in one piece.

'We have to be so careful when we lift it onto the windowsill but it amazes me just how well it has lasted.

'We do have a 5ft Christmas tree which we bought five years but I doubt that will last a fraction of the time as my old one.'

Mr Parker's mum Lilly paid seven shillings and six pence for the Christmas tree which she bought in Woolworths.

When Mr Parker married Sybil he took the tree with him and it has since lasted six house moves.

Mrs Parker, 72, said: 'The little tree is part of the family and it wouldn't be Christmas without it.

'Five of the baubles are the same age as the tree and the fairy lights are more than 30 years old. We haven't even had to change any of the bulbs.

'We keep the tree in a bag in the loft and leave on the decorations on otherwise it would fall apart.

'In these hard times when people are struggling for cash they should take a leaf out of our book and keep hold of their Christmas trees for as long as possible.'

The couple have two children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Mrs Parker added: 'The kids love it and every December they ask us when we are going to put it up but we get more excited about it then they get.'
