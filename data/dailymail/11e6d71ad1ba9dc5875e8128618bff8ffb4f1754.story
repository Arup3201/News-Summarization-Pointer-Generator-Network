The snow paved streets of Manchester might be a far cry from the tropical climate of Angel di Maria's native South America, but the Argentine seems to be enjoying himself.

The Manchester United winger, pictured behind his Range Rover, holds his hands aloft and smiles in a post shared on the Instagram account he shares with his wife, Jor Cardoso. 

Di Maria became the most expensive player in British history, signing for The Red Devils for £59.7million from Real Madrid during the 2014 summer transfer window.

Argentine star Di Maria has been in good form for United this season, scoring four goals in 14 appearances

The No 7 was the only Premier League player named in FIFA's World Team of the year for 2014, after shining for Real Madrid on their way to capturing 'La Decima'.

The 26-year-old has featured 14 times this season under new boss Louis Van Gaal, scoring four goals.

Di Maria was instrumental for Argentina at the World Cup, scoring the dramatic winner against Switzerland in the last 16, before a thigh injury brought his involvement in the competition to a premature end.

Manchester United will look to pick up three points in Saturday's home game against Nigel Pearson's struggling Leicester City.
