Embarrassing: Kent Police Commissioner Ann Barnes  has been compared to David Brent after a number of toe-curling moments in an upcoming documentary

A crime tsar has admitted she has 'no idea' what her £85,000-a-year job entails in an embarrassing TV documentary.

Kent Police and Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes,  already notorious for employing a foul-mouthed teenager as her youth adviser, is under more pressure after the latest 'fiasco'.

In one clip, where she has been compared to David Brent, Mrs Barnes draws an onion in an attempt to explain what types of crime Kent Police prioritises.

But when asked what the rings meant she said: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't 
thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) 
as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.'

She is then asked: 'So what would be an example of the kind of crime on 
the outside of that ring?', to which she replies that he had 'no idea'.

The Cutting Edge show, called Meet the Commissioner, is due to be aired on Channel 4 on May 29, is yet another embarrassment for Mrs Barnes, whose 18 months in charge at Kent Police has been dogged with controversy.

In it she is asked: 'What is a police commissioner?' and
 replies: 'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not 
the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner.'

In trouble: Kent Police and Crime Commissioner with her 'Onion' diagram explaining police priorities, but when asked to explain what it meant she said: 'Oh God, I've got no idea'

Confused: The Cutting Edge documentary producer also asked her to name crimes towards the outer rings of the onion and again said, 'no idea'

 When she tries to explain on the white flipboard what a Police Crime Commissioner is she writes PPC – before realising she has the initials wrong saying 'Let's start again'.

Then after struggling to explain what the job means she says: 'It's a strange job because there is actually no description at 
all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no
 actual job description.'

Later she is shown being driven around Kent in her taxpayer-funded £15,000 'battle bus' - 'Ann Force One' - which she uses to promote herself as the public face of Kent Police.

Asked about criticism she received for spending public money on the minibus, 
she says: 'My budget is £317m, £15,000 is money well spent - I could 
have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's not my image.'

She is then shown driving a convertible Mercedes
 and parking it in her reserved spot at Maidstone police station.

Tory Rupert Turpin, who sits on Kent Police and Crime Panel, said it was another 'media fiasco' for the PCC.

'From what I have seen it was extremely ill-advised to do a warts-and-all documentary,' he said.

'The documentary shows that she doesn't have a strong grasp of detail and brings the whole force into disrepute.

'She doesn’t know her onions and apparently doesn’t know her bananas skins either'.  

Spending: Mrs Barnes called her £15,000 Ann Force One battle bus good value because she could have spent the cash on a Mercedes

Contrast: In the documentary, moments after describing how a Mercedes wasn't her style, she is shown pulling up in a top of the range convertible model in her private space at work

Ann Barnes has blamed 'mischievous editing' and said today: 'When I was approached with the idea to do this documentary I gave it very careful thought.

'I finally agreed because I have vowed to be open and transparent about my job as Kent Police and Crime Commissioner.

'It’s a shame that after four months of filming, so much has ended up on the cutting room floor and the result is a mere snapshot of my working life, addressing none of the many complexities of the post of Commissioner.

'There has been an element of mischievous editing here and I would ask people to make up their own minds after watching the whole programme and not after seeing a 32 second Channel 4 publicity clip.'

A senior police source told MailOnline: 'This is yet another disaster for Ann, but I'm sure she won't resign, it's not in her nature.

'She thinks she is a media darling but this has backfired badly.

'There was more than a hint of David Brent in those clips, especially when she explained her onion'.

Another police source said today: 'The documentary 
shows exactly why people around the UK are disillusioned with the role 
of police commissioners.

'They
 generally have no idea about the realities of policing and just looking
 at the clips of the show made me cringe in embarrassment for her.'

On what her 'Crime Onion' means: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.'

On her job: 'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not 
the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner.

'It's a strange job because there is actually no description at 
all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no
 actual job description.'

On her Ann Force One battle bus: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's not my image.'

Adam Howarth, 43, of Ashford, Kent, said: 'I can't wait to watch the whole show - the poor lady obviously hasn't got a clue.'

On its website, Channel 4 said the Cutting Edge show was an attempt to gauge the success of commissioners.

It states: 'Do the public see her as an independent breath of fresh air, who will roll her sleeves up to get things done, or a gaffe-prone amateur who stands no chance in the face of a massive cuts to police funding?'

The crime tsar came in for criticism last month when she spent almost £200,000 moving her office less than two miles.

Mrs Barnes was elected as the first PCC in Kent in November 2012 despite previously branding the Government's plan to increase police accountability a 'wilful waste of money'.

She became the most high-profile of the country’s 41 crime tsars a year ago when The Mail on Sunday revealed her £15,000 youth commissioner, Paris Brown, 17, had posted a series of highly offensive comments online.

Miss Brown wrote the messages during the last six months before she was given the role of helping the force ‘stay in touch with young people’.

She called homosexuals ‘fags’, immigrants ‘illegals’ and travellers ‘pikeys’, and said she had ‘a thing for older men’, an apparent reference to a teacher at her former school.

In another tweet, seemingly referring to cannabis, she wrote: ‘I really wanna make a batch of hash brownies.’ And she attacked the men in the reality TV programme Made In Chelsea, writing: ‘Everyone on Made In Chelsea looks like a ******* fag.’

Mrs Barnes tried to save the teenager's job, but Brown was forced to quit.

Channel 4's 'Meet the Commissioner' will be broadcast on Thursday, May 29 at 9pm.

Scathing: Commissioner Bob Jones claims PCCs have been a £100m waste of money

Police and crime commissioners have the job of ‘bringing communities closer to the police, building confidence in the system and restoring trust’.

They were brought in across England and Wales in November 2012 by the Conservatives to set budgets and decide on strategies while also holding chief constables to account.

But lack of enthusiasm for the reform meant the polls were held with little publicity, and a record low 15 per cent of voters turned out.

They are tasked with creating a police and crime plan, setting the force budget and appointing or dismissing the chief constable.

The former police authorities also had the power to hire and fire chief constables but this rarely happened.

But one of the elected crime tsars branded them £100million waste of money and spend their time dreaming up gimmicks and clashing with senior officers.

The Labour PCC for the West  Midlands Bob Jones confessed that in their first year in charge of police forces, Police and Crime Commissioners did not make them run better nor made the public safer.

PCCs have become embroiled in a series of  scandals, including:

Cumbria’s Tory PCC Richard Rhodes took two chauffeur-driven trips to meetings, costing taxpayers £700, and when the news was leaked to a local paper, the whistleblower was arrested.

PCCs in Gwent and Lincolnshire forced out their chief constables. In each force only one person applied to take over the top job.

A dozen or so PCCs handed out well-paid deputy roles to friends and allies without advertising them.

At least four PCCs have already been investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission for alleged criminal misconduct.

Several PCCs have caused controversy over expenses, including Norfolk’s Stephen Bett who declared his home as his place of work, allowing him to claim mileage for driving to the force HQ. He agreed to repay £3,000.
