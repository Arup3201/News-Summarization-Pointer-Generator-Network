The parents of American journalist James Foley have said that the U.S. government and press didn't do enough to keep their son from being killed by Islamic State militants. 

John and Diane Foley, speaking at a University of Arizona forum on Thursday, said the government shut them out and failed to help them while their son, a freelance journalist, was held captive for nearly two years.

His parents also spoke about the identity of their son's killer, 'Jihadi John', after he was revealed as 26-year-old Mohammed Emwazi from London.

Journalist James Foley's parents, John and Diane, said during a university event on Thursday (pictured) that identifying their son's killer  did not matter to them

James Foley, 40, was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012 and executed in August 2014. He was shown in an ISIS propaganda video alongside the extremist killer.  

'The point is if we capture him and bring him to justice, what does that do? ISIS is still doing its thing. It's a very narrow approach. The only thing I'll be happy with is when ISIS is defeated,' John Foley said on Thursday.

'The next "Jihadi John" is on the way.' 

Emwazi had a privileged upbringing which included earning a computer science degree from University of Westminster.

Diane Foley said that the details of his background 'makes that even more sad that he'd want to use his gifts for such evil and such hatred. It's very frightening to me'.

Mrs Foley added: 'We need to forgive him for not having a clue what he was doing.'

Mr Foley said he would not dwell on the background of his son's killer.

'In all fairness, discovering who he is might be important to some people but it's certainly not important to me,' he said outside the forum, according to KLTV.

James Foley, 40, was executed by Islamic State militants in August 2014, which was broadcast by ISIS in a video with 'Jihadi John'. 

The Foleys were joined at the Arizona event by Terry Anderson, a former Associated Press correspondent who was held captive in Lebanon for nearly seven years, and David McGraw, an attorney for The New York Times.

The group agreed that the government uses the policy of not paying ransom or negotiating with terrorists to avoid answering questions to families about the state of their loved ones. 

They said officials kept families in the dark.

'For one year, we didn't really know where he was or whether he was alive,' Mr Foley said.

'We had no one who was accountable for Jim, if you will,' Mrs Foley added.

She said outside the forum that what she wanted was a clearer policy so 'our journalists going out in the field can be protected, and valued. And then American hostage families can be respected and our government can treat us with some honesty'. 

The Foleys echoed the sentiments of the family of Kayla Mueller, a young international aid worker who recently was killed while held captive by militants

Ms Mueller's family said in an interview on NBC's 'Today' that U.S. government policies were contradictory and prevented the 26-year-old from Prescott, Arizona, from being rescued.

A White House spokesman said the government acted in the best interest of the nation. 

The Foleys said that the government uses the policy of not ransoming captives or negotiating with terrorist groups to avoid keeping the loves ones of hostages such as their son (pictured) informed

James Foley's parents also said some responsibility lies with the American media, who failed to continue reporting on their son's kidnapping, letting it fall out of the news cycle.

'We're a hot item when it's a fresh story, but after the item dissipates, we couldn't catch a cold,' Mr Foley said.

The parents have created a foundation named after their son to help Americans held captive abroad.  

Mr McGraw said the U.S. has inconsistent policies for dealing with kidnapped US citizens.

An example, he said, was the exchange of members of a militant group affiliated with the Taliban for the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.

'I think the idea of telling families that they shouldn't even talk to the hostage takers is really, really bad advice,' Mr McGraw said.

The panelists focused on the importance of journalism and of affording protections for freelance journalists, who don't have the financial backing of large news organizations and are often in more danger.

'You can't have a free society without a free press,' said Mr Anderson, who now teaches at the University of Florida.
