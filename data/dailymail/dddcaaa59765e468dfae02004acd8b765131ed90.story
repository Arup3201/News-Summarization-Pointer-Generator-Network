A British student has drowned in a swimming pool while on holiday in Malaysia.

Part-time Chinese takeaway worker Lawrence Chung, 21, was with members of his family when the accident happened.

The games design student, who could not swim, had been involved in a crash and it is believed this could have contributed to his drowning.

Friends were informed of his death by his brother-in-law who posted the news on the student's Facebook wall.

Close friend Josh Slack organised a tribute at a pub in Barnsley town centre attended by 150 people including Lawrence's girlfriend Rebecca Colton.

Josh said: 'He was the nicest guy you could ask to meet.'

In his tribute at the pub, Josh said: 'His family have been in touch with me and asked me to say a few words to his friends over here in Barnsley.

'They want to thank you for all the photographs and messages that you have been sending.

'The family has seen each and every one and it really has lifted their spirits knowing how much of a difference he made to each and everyone's lives in one way or another.

'I can't imagine him being in a happier place. I am sure we can all remember Lawrence for so many different things.

'We all have our own memories of him and those are the things we need to keep in mind.

'Whenever he was in the room he wouldn't let anyone be sad he would slide over with his cheeky grin, hand you a drink and he'd always have his own way of pulling you round.

'There was a warmth in his character that took to everyone and that is why everyone will always remember him.'

His sister Loretta Chung said on Facebook: 'It is so sad to say goodbye to my brother, but I hope he is in a better place now and he'll be very proud of having so much lovely friends around him, even when he's gone u guys r there for him too!'

Lawrence, of Redbrook, Barnsley helped out at the Chung family's Mandarin Chinese takeaway in nearby Wilthorpe.

His body was due to be flown back to the UK for a funeral service in Barnsley.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said they were aware of the death of a British national in Kuala Lumpur on August 20.

A spokesman said: 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'

The family declined to comment.
