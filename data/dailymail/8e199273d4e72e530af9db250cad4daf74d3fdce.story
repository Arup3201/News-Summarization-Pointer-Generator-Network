Spared jail: Leoni Pryke, 24, threatened staff after they refused to allow her to take her child home because she was drunk

A mother threatened four teachers after they refused to allow her to take her five-year-old daughter home  because she was drunk on the school run, a court heard.

An intoxicated Leoni Pryke, 24, then attempted to set off a fire alarm after  staff barred her from a classroom where they were protecting the child.

Pryke subjected teachers to a tirade of abuse, swearing and threats for 15 minutes and staff are said to have  feared they could be attacked.

They refused to release her daughter because they believed she was not fit to care for her. 

The 24-year-old pleaded guilty at Beverley Magistrates' Court to using threatening, abusive and insulting words or behaviour during the row last November.

But she avoided jail yesterday but a judge  warned her if she did it again she would be sent to prison.

Four teachers at Swinemoor Primary School in the East Yorkshire town said Leoni Pryke became aggressive after being told she was in no fit state to collect her child.

The incident happened just a month after her daughter started at the school.

District Judge Frederick Rutherford said: 'I'm told that she attended the school to collect her five-year-old daughter, and that she was late because she had expected someone else to be there.

'She was described as being well in drink and teaching staff were reluctant to allow the child to be placed in her care.'

He said Pryke was aggressive and had tried to get into the room where teachers were looking after her daughter.

She had pushed one member of staff and was abusive to others.

Pryke tried to set off a fire alarm and subjected teachers to a 15-minute tirade of shouting and swearing.

'It was extremely upsetting for the staff,' said Judge Rutherford.

Pryke, of  Beverley, had been warned she could face jail for her actions. However, pre-sentence reports concluded the incident was out of character.

She was handed a 12-month supervision order and told she was lucky to escape jail.

Judge Rutherford praised Pryke for her guilty plea and noted she had sent a letter of apology to the school.

Response: Staff at Swinemoor Primary School in Beverley, East Yorkshire, kept the child in the classroom and stopped the mother from entering because she was intoxicated 

Speaking directly to Pryke he said: 'Quite obviously you are utterly ashamed of your behaviour, but we have heard all the aggregating features and I can't ignore them.

'It was utterly out of character - why on earth you attended school under the influence of alcohol only you know.

'You are extremely fortunate not to be sent to prison.

'It is only because it would have a catastrophic effect on others, otherwise you would be going.

'The best way forward is to make an order. If you breach that order, you shall be going to prison.'

Leon Myers, headteacher at Swinemoor Primary School said antisocial behaviour would not be tolerated in any form.

He said: 'The governing body and I believe the safety and welfare of our pupils and staff at Swinemoor Primary School is paramount and antisocial behaviour of any kind will not be tolerated.

'In our school, everybody should work constantly to develop a purposeful and quality environment, well ordered for work and free from unnecessary interruption and intimidation.

'We believe this environment is necessary to create a broad and balanced curriculum.'

Pryke was fined £110 and ordered to pay £85 in costs and a £60 surcharge.
