It's the tiny bundles of fur that's got everyone talking this summer.

But after a wave of extreme blaze in South Australia, the Adelaide Koala and Wildlife Hospital has been keeping themselves busy treating and caring for their latest burn victims.

Six injured koalas named Leaf, Lenny, Lexi, Klaire, Lou and Cinders were recently taken to the hospital to rehabilitate and recover after what's described as one of the state's worst bushfires.

Adelaide Koala and Wildlife Hospital Dr Sheridan Lathe told Daily Mail Australia that the little fighters have been treated with fluid therapy, burns cream, antibiotics and pain relief daily.

The marsupials also get fed with a special paste formula to boost their energy and protein levels three times a day, as well as all the leafy greens they can get their paws on.

Cheeky Klaire has been pulling off her bandages but the soon to be mother has had special daily check ups to ensure her baby's survival - and the little joey is growing inside each day.

While Lexy had burns to both his back feet with one of his front paws being severely injured and his skin has started to peel off 'like a glove' but he is getting all the tender, loving care.

Little Cinders received burns to both her back paws and two fingers on one hand but she is recovering well.

And one of the older male koalas, Lenny has been able to eat well and climb again after receiving deep partial thickness burns to his back pads.

Despite the number of injured marsupials, Dr Lathe said the hospital has received an overwhelming amount of support and generosity from the public.

'We'd like to thank everyone who has expressed their gratitude and supported us through - it's been great.

It comes after the hospital launched an appeal for seamstress to sew for the heat-stricken koalas with burnt paws who are in desperate need for mittens followed by the devastating bushfires.
