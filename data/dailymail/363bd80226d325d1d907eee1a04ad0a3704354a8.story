Tragic: A funeral service is to be held for murdered April Jones almost a year to the day that she went missing

The parents of murdered schoolgirl April Jones are to finally hold a funeral for their daughter, burying 17 tiny fragments of her bone found in her killer's house.

The forensic remains found in Mark Bridger's fireplace will be returned to heartbroken Paul and Coral Jones almost a year after they were found by detectives.

They will place the remains in a pink coffin and take them through the town of Machynleth, Powys, on a horse drawn carriage.

Mrs Jones told The Sun: 'They are all we have. We can now finally lay April to rest. Our hell this past year has been made worse because we did not have April's body.'

Mourners will be asked to wear pink which was April's favourite colour and became the symbol of the massive seven-month long search for her.

The funeral has been arranged to give Mr and Mrs Jones, both 41, some closure after the devastating murder of their five-year-old daughter.

It will be held later this month almost exactly a year after April was snatched off the street by abattoir worker Bridger, 47, on October 1 last year.

A family friend said: 'It will be a very sad day for Coral and Paul but it is something they want to do,

'The police have returned the small pieces of bone found in Bridger's home and that's all they have of their beautiful daughter.

'It is something for them to bury, something to say goodbye to.'

School girl April was snatched by Bridger while playing outside her parents home on her bicycle after school.

Her disappearance sparked the biggest missing person search in British criminal history.

But despite the Â£2.4million search, police were never able to find her body.

Forensic officers found 17 tiny pieces of bone, some from April's skull, in the fireplace of Bridger's isolated cottage in the village of Caersws, near Machynlleth.

The bones played a major part in the trial of father-of-five Bridger who was found guilty of murder, abduction and perverting the course of justice in May.

Grief: Coral and Paul Jones will finally be able to hold a funeral for their daughter

The funeral service is expected to be held at St Peters Church in Machynlleth and hundreds of people are expected to turn up to say their farewells to a little girl they never even knew.

Police officers, mountain rescue experts, divers and members of the public who volunteered to join search parties will attend.

Detectives from Dyfed Powys Police will also be at the service along with three family liaison officers who helped Mr and Mrs Jones through the torment of losing their little girl.

The final details of the funeral cannot be made until an inquest is formally opened by the Powys Coroner Louise Hunt on Monday.

Former Mayor of Machynlleth councillor Michael Williams said: 'It is the right and proper thing to happen.

'It will bring people together again in one place to remember the life of a little child that was taken so savagely from the family and community.

'I don't think it will be a final goodbye but it will be another step in remembering all the wonderful times that the family had together.

'There is no doubt it has been a tough time for the town - but the Dyfi Valley has pulled together in the darkest of hours.'
