In true Hollywood fashion, the Academy Awards on Sunday promised a cliffhanger finale to the tight race for best picture Oscar between favorites 12 Years a Slave and Gravity and a big gamble on rain and the red carpet.

After three days of heavy downpours soaked parts of the red carpet along Hollywood Boulevard, workers removed the plastic tenting and unwrapped the golden Oscar statues hours before hundreds of movie stars in designer dresses and tuxedos begin arriving for Hollywood's biggest night.

And while it was still drizzling outside the Dolby Theatre as TV crews from around the world went live from Hollywood, organizers were confident that the most glamorous of red carpet shows would go off without a hitch. They did, however, keep a bunch of umbrellas on hand.

Unlike the stormy hosting of Seth MacFarlane last year, this Oscar show with host Ellen DeGeneres has a deliberately safe vibe of cheery song-and-dance.

The nimble and amiable DeGeneres is expected to return the broadcast to more traditional territory. Many of the night's biggest categories, too, seem to hold little chance for surprise.

The well-established favorites include Matthew McConaughey, Cate Blanchett, Lupita Nyong'o and Jared Leto. Each comes into Oscar Sunday having won a parade of awards over the last few months, including honors at Saturday's Spirit Awards.

The night's biggest question mark won't come until the very end. The historical drama 12 Years a Slave, the 3-D space spectacle Gravity and the con-artist caper American Hustle are vying for best picture in the night's closest contest.

Gravity is expected to lead the ceremony in total awards, cleaning up in technical categories like visual effects and cinematography.

Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron is considered a lock for best director for seamlessly marshalling new digital technology to render the lost-in-space drama. He would be the first Latino to win the category.

While the global hit easily topped the other eight best-picture nominees at the box office, the lower budget, less widely seen 12 Years a Slave is believed to have a narrow edge for the academy's top honor.

Though voters last year chose entertainment over history lesson (Ben Affleck's Argo over Steven Spielberg's Lincoln), many see Steve McQueen's brutal adaptation of Solomon Northup's memoir as a landmark film difficult to watch but impossible to overlook.

ABC, which is telecasting the ceremony, hopes the drama of the best-picture race will be enough to entice viewers.

The show last year drew an audience of 40.3 million, up from 39.3 million the year before when the silent-film ode The Artist won best picture.

Frontrunners: Matthew McConaughey and Cate Blanchett Aattended the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday, and the actors did not leave empty-handed - taking home the best actor and actress gongs respectively

Favorite: Matthew McConaughey is thought to be the front-runner to take home the prize for Best Actor for his work in the AIDS drama Dallas Buyers Club

This year's Oscars celebrate what is widely regarded as one of the most high quality years in film and performances in recent memory.

The president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, called it the best line-up 'in the last decade or so.'

That means that awards are likely to be scattered widely as the 6,000-plus members of the Academy seek to reward as many films as possible with the famed golden statuettes.

While British director Steve McQueen's brutal slavery drama 12 Years a Slave is the presumed frontrunner for best picture, Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron's groundbreaking space thriller Gravity lurks just behind. And there could be an upset for the night's top honors.

'I feel more comfortable putting my chips on '12 Years a Slave' just because there is more historical basis for doing so,' said Scott Feinberg, awards analyst at The Hollywood Reporter.

'But at the same time there is no denying that there is great enthusiasm for other movies.'

Among those is 1970s crime caper American Hustle from director David O. Russell, which scored 10 nominations.

For the second year in a row, Russell has achieved the rare feat of having his actors nominated in all four acting categories.

Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, a tale of financial greed and excess, has also been a hit with audiences and critics.

A total of nine films are competing for best picture, including Somali piracy thriller Captain Phillips, the adoption drama Philomena, the heartland comedy Nebraska, the computer-age romance Her, and the AIDS activist biopic Dallas Buyers Club.

But the Academy could also make history this year if it chooses 12 Years a Slave for best picture.

It would be the first time that the top film honor goes to a movie by a black director in the 86 years of the Oscars.

On Saturday, the real-life story of free man turned plantation slave Solomon Northup gained more momentum by sweeping the Independent Spirit Awards, a show that recognizes movies made on small budgets. It scored five wins out of seven nominations, including best feature film.

The Spirit Awards also bestowed honors on the frontrunners for all four acting races for the Oscars, which may yield few surprises on Sunday.

Cate Blanchett won best actress at the Spirit Awards for her portrayal of the disgraced socialite in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine.

Matthew McConaughey took best actor for his role as the unlikely AIDS activist in Dallas Buyers Club, for which he lost some 50 pounds (23 kg) and his co-star Jared Leto won best supporting actor.

Also on Saturday, newcomer Lupita Nyong'o won best supporting actress for her role as hardworking slave Patsey in 12 Years a Slave but she faces a challenge at the Oscars from Jennifer Lawrence as the loopy housewife in American Hustle.

Sunday's show caps an unusually long awards season extended by weeks by the Winter Olympics and fatigue was evident.

'Yeah, I'm a little bit tired today,' Blanchett said on Saturday, adding 'but I'm full of adrenaline, whatever happens, it's a very exciting place to be.'

The Oscars show will feature homages to movie heroes and The Wizard of Oz on its 75th anniversary. U2 and Pharrell Williams will be among the performers for best original song.

Among the presenters will be Hollywood power couple Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt as well as Sidney Poitier on the 50th anniversary of his best actor win for Lilies of the Field, the first Oscar in that category for an African American.
