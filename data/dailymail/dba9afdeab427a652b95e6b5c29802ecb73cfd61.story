Dave Chappelle was not amused when a drunken man hurled a banana peel at him during a stand-up show in New Mexico Monday night.  

Christian Englander, 30, of Santa Fe, struck the funnyman in the leg, earning himself a trip to jail on misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct and battery.

Englander acknowledged throwing a peel from a banana he had eaten earlier because he took offense to racially insensitive jokes Chappelle made about his companion, police said.

Not amused: Santa Fe police say a man tossed a banana peel at Dave Chappelle during a show in New Mexico Monday, hitting in the comedian in the leg. Here Chappelle performs last summer

Thrower: Christian Englander, 30, of Santa Fe, was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor disorderly conduct and battery. He told police he was angry at comments Chappelle made about his friend that night

Chappelle was performing a comedy routine at the Lensic theater in Santa Fe when a banana peel struck him 

The friend reportedly was drawing in a sketchbook during the show at Lensic theater Monday night when Chappelle noticed and asked the man his name, which he gave as 'Johnny Appleseed,' Santa Fe police spokesperson Andrea Dobyns said.

Chappelle then made jokes about the moniker, the police spokeswoman said, 'so that's when Englander got upset.'

According to TMZ, the man thought Chappelle's quips were racist, so he decided to throw the peel, which he had in his pocket after consuming a banana and washing it down with a shot of the alcoholic beverage 99 Bananas at a convenience store before the show. 

Arresting officers said Englander appeared to be intoxicated after event security escorted him outside.

Racial attack: Chappelle told police Englander did not seem remorseful, and he believed the banana attack was racially motivated 

Englander was in jail Tuesday, and Dobyns said she didn't know whether he has an attorney to speak on his behalf.

Chappelle has had his share of run-ins with audience members in the past.

Fueled up: Englander said he ate the banana and washed it down with a shot of 99 Bananas liquor before the show 

In a 2013 gig in Hartford, Connecticut, Chappelle shut down his act after 10 minutes because of heckling.

Known for his sharp commentary on race relations in America, Chappelle has gradually resumed his stand-up career in the past two years, making a long-awaited return after abruptly abandoning a popular Comedy Central show in 2005.

Court documents indicate that following his arrest Monday night, Christian Englander 'appeared unapologetic and made several statements that appeared to be racially motivated.’

A criminal complaint cited by the Albuquerque Journal states that while smiling and laughing, Englander said: 'maybe I should have handed you [Chappelle] the banana instead.'

Chappelle told police it seemed that his attacker was not remorseful and that the banana toss was 'racially motivated,' according to the complaint. The 41-year-old comedian indicated that he wanted to press charges against Englander.

Once Englander was removed from the venue, Chappelle resumed his routine but spent the remainer of his set harping on the fruit fracas.

‘First I'm going to kill him with my comedy then I'm going to kick him in his f***ing face,’ he said, according to an audio recording made by an audience member and shared online. ‘By the way, these are empty threats.’

He later expressed a desire to hurl a tuna casserole in his assailant's face and to choke the life out of him - but noted that he wouldn't do it because it's against the law.

The famed comedian took issue with the fact that the fruit hurled at him was not even fresh and marveled at the fact that someone would carry a banana peel in their pocket.

‘Why didn't he throw a good banana at me? Just the brown peel? Where's the rest of it? I am actually offended by the poor quality of the banana. It was brown, man,’ he was quoted as saying by the news blog NewsCastic. 

But the pugnacious performer said he was not surprised that it happened to him.

‘I wish I could be, “I can't believe this is happening,” but in all honestly, I've been expecting that banana for many years,’ Chappelle told the crowd. ‘I just didn't know tonight was going to be the night.'

The former Comedy Central star also used the incident to gently rib the popular comedy duo Key and Peele, who currently have a sketch show on the cable network.

‘Key and Peele probably did that s***,’ he joked, referring to the banana throw. ‘Key and Banana Peel.’

Chappelle is expected to carry on his comedy tour, performing a show in El Paso, Texas, Tuesday night.
