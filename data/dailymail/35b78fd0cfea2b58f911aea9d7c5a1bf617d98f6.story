Amateur astronomers across the U.S. who keept their eyes peeled this weekend to saw a dazzling light show as the second grand meteor shower of the year peaked early Saturday.

Amateur photographers captured gorgeous images of the meteors as dozens per hour fell across the night skies.

As amateur Scott Tully in rural Conecticut told MSNBC after capturing a shot of a blazing Leonid meteor streaking overhead: 'Amazing!'

Shooting: In Freeland, Maryland, amateur observers snapped beautiful pics of the Leonids before dawn

The best nights to view the Leonid meteor shower, pictured, will be 17 and 20 November

Budding astronomers could see between 10 and 15 bright meteors an hour as the shower reaches its peak

Star gazers should not concentrate on the area around constellation Leo but keep their eyes moving across the sky.Â The best time to look for the Leonid meteors will be after midnight. It is thought to be the best time to watch out for shooting stars too.The Leonids move around the sun in the direction opposite to that of Earth so they slam into our atmosphere almost head-on.

It causes the fastest meteor velocities possible: 45 miles per second.

The Leonid meteors are cosmic dust and debris, shed into space by comet Tempel-Tuttle,  which was 
discovered by German astronomer Ernst Tempel in 1865.

Experts predicted sky watchers could be treated to between 10 and 15 bright meteors an hour.

The comet orbits the sun once every 33 years. Every time it completes an orbit, it leaves behind a trail of dust in its wake. These orbit around the sun and the earth usually hits a different trail every year.

Experts predicted this year would be a 
particularly good year to look for the Leonids because the 
moon will be only crescent and will have set in the west long before the
constellation Leo begins to rise.

With the moon out of the sky completely, viewing conditions could be ideal for sky watchers with clear weather and dark skies.

It was a rare opportunity to see meteors up to 600 years old.

The Leonids have a reputation for their 
brightness.

The show follows hot on the heels of the Perseid meteor shower back in August.
