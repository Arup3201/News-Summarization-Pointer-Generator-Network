A 13-year-old boy who was bullied at school for being part of a cheerleading club committed suicide in Kern County, California on Monday.

In the days leading up to his death Nigel Hardy was said to have been ‘despondent’ after being suspended for getting into a fight with another pupil at Hillview Middle School in Palmdale.

The fight, which occurred last Friday, was related to Hardy’s involvement with the AV Dynasty All-Stars, an extracurricular cheerleading club.

Nigel Hardy, 13, had been subjected to bullying at school for being part of a cheerleading club prior to his death

Hardy had only been a pupil at Hillview Middle School for 12 weeks ago after his family moved to the area from out of state.

Principal Robert Garza told the L.A. 
Times that he felt the school had handled the situation appropriately, 
although a community meeting will be held next week to discuss the event
and examine school and district policy.

A seventh-grader, who described himself as Nigel's best friend, told the L.A. Times that Hardy was bullied and mocked for being a cheerleader.

‘I would tell him “I got your back, they can't say those things just because you're a cheerleader,”’ the boy said. ‘I'd try to defend him.’

Hardy was reported missing on Monday morning after his father found an apparent suicide note in the teen's room and discovered his handgun was missing.

Though Hardy's note did not threaten the school or any individuals, Hillview was placed on lockdown as a precaution as authorities searched for the boy.

He body was found around 8:30 p.m. on Monday evening, having suffered an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

Hardy was admitted to Antelope Valley Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police are investigating the incident as a suicide.

‘Our hearts are with the parents and family of Nigel Hardy as they deal with this tremendous personal loss,’ Regina Rossall, Westside Union School District's superintendent, said in a statement.
