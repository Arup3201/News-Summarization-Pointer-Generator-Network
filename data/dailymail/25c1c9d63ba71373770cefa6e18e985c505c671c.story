Armed police in grey and blue uniforms cluster every few yards along Avenue Interlagos, the wide and teeming road leading to the track on which Lewis Hamilton has tasted almost equal measures of euphoria and dejection.

The journey in carries a frisson of fear. Favelas - the giant shanty towns of deprived millions - stand on either side of the street. And out of those shacks can run gun-toting criminals to hold up cars that stop when the lights turn red.

Barely a year passes without someone from the Formula One community being robbed or shot at.

Lewis Hamilton says he has no fears as he battles for the Formula One Drivers' World Championship

Hamilton goes into Sunday's Brazil Grand Prix with a 24-point lead over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg

Inside Interlagos, home of Sunday’s Brazilian Grand Prix, is far less dangerous than outside, but the old crumpled place still possesses the most intimidating atmosphere in world motor racing.

The four stands along the pit straight turn into cacophonous pits of hate, of hissing and whistling, jeering and cheering, as the cars line up to race.

Hamilton knows this well. The crowd’s enmity poured down on him when he was in a title fight with a Paulista, Felipe Massa, in 2008. That year he triumphed unforgettably by passing the Toyota car of Timo Glock to finish fifth on the final, rainy lap. He had atoned for his late-season collapse 12 months earlier.

So here we are again with Hamilton on the cusp of world championship glory. He leads Nico Rosberg, his fellow Mercedes man, by 24 points with only Abu Dhabi awaiting him after Sunday’s race. But this time he is visibly relaxed and scared of nobody.

‘I don’t have any fears,’ he declared. ‘Honestly, you can look in my eyes, I don’t have any fears. I feel like where I am today is not down to luck. There are reasons why we have the best car today and why we’ve had the results this year. That’s all the hard work that’s gone in.

‘In these last two races I’m going to do everything I can do, and whatever the result at the end of it, it’s the way it is, but I will know I did everything I could.’

In normal circumstances Hamilton would win the title here if he finished ahead of Rosberg, thus rendering the Abu Dhabi race in a fortnight irrelevant.

But, no, points at Abu Dhabi count double. This new rule is a skewing of the sport’s integrity - please don’t laugh - and robs Sunday's race of a potential championship outcome before a wheel is turned in anger.

Rosberg can win the title at Abu Dhabi regardless of Hamilton's position in Brazil due to offer of double points 

Abu Dhabi is an awful venue, double scoring or not. It is synthetic. The track is puny. The weather is predictably dry. There is no natural audience. A lot of ‘B2B’ (business to business) transactions take place in the oversized hospitality blocks but that hardly compensates for the place’s manifest inadequacies.

But the Abu Dhabi rulers have written a cheque the size of the desert, c/o Mr BC Ecclestone of London SW7, in exchange for the privilege of staging the finale - and that, my capitalist friends, is that.

There is simply no use arguing that Interlagos’ undulating track with its history and its fan base and its capricious weather should have that honour.

Hamilton knows how special Brazilian motor racing is, being an aficionado of Ayrton Senna, an icon who appealed to the rich and poor of his nation alike. Governments come and go - former Marxist guerrilla Dilma Rousseff has just been re-elected, supposedly, with 51 per cent of the vote - but Senna’s status endures.

He is buried on a grassy knoll up the road at the Morumbi graveyard. The road from Guarulhos airport into the sprawl of the city bears his name. And only this week, a giant portrait comprising a patchwork of his family’s denim jeans was unveiled at the Ayrton Senna Institute.

‘When I was younger,’ said Hamilton, ‘I used to put on this one particular video of Ayrton, Racing Is In My Blood. I watched that God knows how many times. He really inspired me as a kid and he still does today. Every now and then someone may mention my name in the same sentence as his, and I feel really proud and honoured by that.

‘I come here and I still feel his presence. He still lives on through his fans and the country. It’s one of the most special things I’ve ever seen. I met his niece this week and she said his mum is a fan, which is amazing.’

Caterham have called on fans to donate £2.35million to save them from closure, the fate that befell fellow strugglers Marussia on Friday.

Administrators announced that Marussia’s 200 staff at their factory in Banbury, Oxfordshire, had been made redundant. It is believed the team, whose driver Jules Bianchi remains critical but stable after his accident in Japan, had debts of £31m.

Caterham, who owe £16m, have launched an ambitious crowdfunding project to try to raise funds to compete at the final race in Abu Dhabi. They will offer ‘rewards’ in return for donations. The minimum pledge is £10. By last night they had raised more than £100,000 towards their £2.35m target.

Marussia have folded after administrators confirmed the British-based outfit have ceased trading
