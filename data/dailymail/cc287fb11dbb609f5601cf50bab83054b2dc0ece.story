Busty blonde Lacey Wildd performs an array of bizarre party tricks with her LLL implants in tonight's episode of TLC's My Strange Addiction.

In a preview clip for the show, the 45-year-old mother-of-six from Florida, reveals how she can use her silicon chest as a drinks tray, proudly balancing two champagne glasses without a wobble.

She then turns out the lights and puts a flashlight to her bosom, exclaiming 'I've got my own jack-o'-lanterns' as her overstretched chest starts to glow.

But it's not all fun and games, and Ms Wildd reveals there are many things she can't do with her cartoon-like curves.

For instance, she cannot lay down on her back for too long otherwise she starts to feel faint.

'I do feel like I'm being suffocated,' the glamor model admits as she reclines on the couch.

Addicted: Despite her implants causing issues, Ms Wildd is determined to go from an LLL to a QQQ so she can claim title to the largest augmented breasts in the world

Instead she uses four or five pillows to keep her propped up at a 30 degree angle during the night.

She also can't tell when she's due her next pedicure as it's difficult to see over her protruding torso.

'I can't even tell you the last time I could see my toes or my feet,' she exclaims.

Her youngest daughter, Jenaveve, says that it's almost impossible to hug her.

'I just give it under her boobs . . . so they don't crush me,' the youngster said.

Despite
 her implants causing issues, Ms Wildd is determined to go from an LLL 
to a QQQ so she can claim title to the largest augmented breasts in the 
world.

Last year, she raised $23,000 in donations from fans for the surgery - which will be her thirteenth in total.

Currently the top spot is held by Maxi Mounds, who wears a U.S. size 42M bra.

Ms
 Wildd said that she is ‘nervous’ about her surgery, paid for by 
internet donations, as medical experts have repeatedly warned her it’s 
not safe.

‘My goal was never to be famous. My goal was to be able to support my children'

Her
 chest is already so heavy at 21lbs, that she had to have an internal
 bra made of pigskin and her own muscle implanted into her torso.

But the bubbly blonde insists that her ambition to increase the size of her breasts is actually for her children's welfare.

‘I want to leave a legacy to my 
children,' says Ms Wildd, who has six children ranging in age from six  
to 29, plus a 25-year-old stepson.

‘My goal was never to be famous. My goal was to be able to take care of them, to be able to support them.’

Embarrassing mum: Lacey Wildd's children - from left Brandan, Michael, Jenaveve, and Tori - desperately want her to stop having surgery

She said growing up she was one of six
 children, and her mother was so poor they couldn’t afford a house with 
electricity or running water.

‘I
 want to provide for my kids and pay for a college education, so they 
have opportunities I didn't have,’ Ms Wildd previously said.

With
 the additional TV appearances, film work and subscriptions to her 
website, laceywildd.net, she says her income has ‘quadrupled' since 2012
 and she plans on retiring in three years time.

However, Ms Wildd’s children, four of 
which still live at home, say that her looks have seen them face 
cyber-bullying and teasing at school.

Upkeep: The glamor model has spent more than $250,000 enhancing her appearance

Her
 daughter Tori Glynn, 18, who appeared with her on MTV's True Life, 
said: ‘She is kind of like too much, and she's not taking into 
consideration that this is your project, this is your thing and not all 
of ours.

Tori and her 
siblings are also concerned about their mother’s health, and fear bigger
 implants will cause terrible side-effects such as stretching, tearing, 
or even an infection that might kill her.

Tori previously said: 'I don't want my mom to have her boobs made any bigger.

'I think she isn't really thinking about our opinions. What if she dies? Is she taking that into consideration?

'Does she really care that her kids could be left alone?'

Despite
 her children's concerns, Ms Wildd, real name Paula Simonds, is 
determined to have the procedure - which will take her closer towards 
her goal of becoming the world's biggest breasted model.

'It will increase my fame and earning 
power considerably. I want to make the most of this opportunity, to give
 my kids a good lifestyle.'

Cosmetic
 surgery carries the same general risks as all operations, including 
infection and blood clots. There's also a risk of bleeding and scarring.

Problems
 that can occur immediately after breast reconstruction surgery include 
infection, fluid under the wound and pain and discomfort.

If
 the area around the breast implant becomes repeatedly infected or fluid
 keeps building up, the implant may need to be removed.

Sometimes, the flap of tissue that is used to make a new breast can die and will need to be surgically removed.

Long-term
 problems that can develop after breast reconstruction surgery include 
the implant hardening and changing shape, fluid leaks from the implant 
making lymph glands swell and unequal-sized breasts due to changes in 
weight.

Growing up in Illinois, Ms Wildd used to be a thin, brunette waitress and became a mother of two in her late teens.

'I
 wasn't making as much money as the blonde girls with the big boobs. I 
had two kids to take care of on my own,' she Ms Wildd who has worked as a
 tattoo artist, a veterinarian assistant and a marketer.

Using
 money from waiting on tables, Ms Wildd saved up money for her first 
implant, and at 21, she expanded from an A cup to a D.

'That
 was the day that changed my life. It gave me a lot more confidence. The
 way people noticed me. People wanted to be around me. I turned myself 
into a Barbie,' she told the newspaper.

She eventually moved to Las Vegas, where she worked as a showgirl and continued developing her figure.

At
 26, she plumped up to a double D cup and three years later, she became a
 triple D and had six more operations to expand her breast size.

At 24 she increased to a K cup and last year, she ballooned to an L cup.

The
 surgery-addicted model, says she prepares her skin before implants to 
avoid the risks of rupturing, and take every care to avoid dangerous 
infections.

Along with 
breast augmentations, Ms Wildd has also had two tummy tucks, four full 
body liposuctions, ab sculpting, lip implants, bottom implants and two 
bottom lifts.

Bigger? Ms Wildd said that she is 'nervous' about her surgery, paid for by internet donations

In the TLC new episode she explains that the muscles in her stomach have been 'sewed together' so she never needs to do a sit-up again.

'It feels like guitar strings,' she says happily stroking her 'man-made' abs.

Cosmetic and reconstructive surgeon Dr Alberto Gallerani, based in Miami, previously warned that Ms Wildd may be suffering from body dysmorphic disorder and should not have further breast implants.

'The skin around her breasts is already extremely thin, and it would be too dangerous for her to undergo more surgery,' he said.

‘I would advise she reconsider and seek help for her surgery obsession.'

But Ms Wildd insists this year’s operation will be her last one.

She
 told the Sun Sentinel: 'My major goal is to actually retire the boobs. I
 never really wanted to be known for my boobs, I guess my boobs made me 
famous.

‘I know a lot of people worry that I am hurting myself or my kids. I promise you, I am not.’
