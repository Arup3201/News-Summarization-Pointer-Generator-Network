A Christian who won the right to wear a cross at work in a landmark European ruling last week has launched another discrimination claim against British Airways.

Nadia Eweida, a passenger services agent at Heathrow,  has accused the airline of disability discrimination.

The case centres around BA’s alleged failure to adjust Miss Eweida’s duties to make allowances for a back disorder, and its decision to remove her from a rota during the Olympics, depriving her of shifts.

It is understood Miss Eweida, 61, from Twickenham, South-West London, believes she has suffered victimisation ever since the company suspended her without pay in 2006 for defying a new policy that banned her from wearing a visible cross around her neck.

She originally lost her case  for religious discrimination at an employment tribunal but took her case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, and last week it ruled in her favour.

Miss Eweida refused to discuss her new claim, which she lodged before her victory, but said: ‘I am still seeking an explanation for some of the ways management have treated me.’ BA said it was ‘resisting’ the claim.
