A neighbor saved the lives of a 66-year-old woman and her two grandchildren, after her car plunged into a swimming pool.

Anita Campbell came to the rescue after hearing the children's cries as the car careered down a hill in California, crashed through a brick wall and landed in the water.

After spotting the submerged car Ms 
Campbell rushed to the family's aid, pulling the grandmother and two girls aged 6 and 9, to safety though an open window.

'It was just timing. I just felt I needed to get them out of the car as fast as I could,' Mrs Campbell said.

The grandmother had apparently lost control of the car in Yorba Linda on Tuesday afternoon. She had just picked her grandchildren up from school at about 2.40pm when she lost control of the car they were in on a hill.

After crashing through a brick wall, the car continued down a steep garden before crashing into the pool.

At first Ms Campbell thought the sound of the crash was an earthquake, then she saw the car under the water in her neighbor's pool.

'I couldn’t get the doors open in the 
car. Luckily, the two windows on the passenger side were open. I had the
girls unbuckle and come out to me,' Ms Campbell told KCAL9.

She had to push the car's airbags out
of the way to make enough room for the family to escape, before helping
them to the side of the pool.

Once the girls were safe, she helped their grandmother get through the car window.

Witnesses say the 66-year-old woman told them her brakes had failed on the hill.

Nicole Koch, who lives nearby, saw the crash from her window.

She told CBSLA: 'I called out to see if everyone was ok. and once we found out everyone was ok, we were all right.'

Victor Altamirano added: 'I can’t believe the car went through the brick wall. I honestly thought the car was just going to hit the brick wall and stop right there.'

The family were taken to the hospital and are said to be in stable condition.

A crane had to be used to remove the car from the bottom of the swimming pool.
