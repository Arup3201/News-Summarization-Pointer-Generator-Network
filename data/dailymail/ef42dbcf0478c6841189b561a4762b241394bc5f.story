Accused: Amanda Engle, 26, allegedly spat on the food ordered by an off-duty policeman who had previously arrested her

A Pizza Hut manager has been arrested and sacked for spitting on food ordered by an off-duty policeman who arrested her a year earlier for drink-driving.

Amanda Engle, 29, recognised the officer when he came to the restaurant in Charlotte, Tennessee, to pick up a take-away order, it is claimed.

She made Unicoi County Sheriff's Deputy Frank Rogers wait while she took his pizza from the oven, turned her back on him and spat on the meal, according to the police report.

In his witness affidavit, Deputy Rogers said: 'The defendant was observed by me depositing bodily fluid on the commercial food which had been purchased by me.

'The defendant did, in a public place, created a hazardous or physically offensive condition by an act that served no legitimate purpose.'

The deputy called police and she was arrested for disorderly conduct following the alleged incident.

'The defendant didnâ€™t ask my name however rang up the order.

'As the defendant removed the pizza from the oven I observed her cut her eyes and look at me.

'The defendant then leaned over the pizza that she had began to slice and I observed her spit on the pizza which had been purchased by me,' Rogers wrote in the affidavit submitted to police, The Smoking Gun reported.

When confronted by the officer, Engle is claimed to have admitted she did recognise Deputy Rogers and that he had arrested her for DUI in April last year.

Only a week before this alleged incident, Engle had been in court to plead guilt to the drink-driving offenses, according to The Smoking Gun.

She had been fined $350, sentenced to two days in jail, and placed on probation for one year for that driving offence.

It is claimed Engle was still angry about the punishment a few days earlier when she seized her opportunity for revenge.

Engle is free on $500 bond and scheduled for a February 20 General Sessions Court appearance.

Pizza Hut has sacked Engle over the alleged incident last Thursday.
