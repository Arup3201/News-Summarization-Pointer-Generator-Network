Arizona Coyotes radio analyst Nick Boynton has been placed on leave after biting a police officer as he was arrested during a fight at a casino, according to reports.

The 36-year-old former NHL player is in police custody at Erie County Medical Center following the alleged incident at the Buffalo Creek Casino in Buffalo, New York on Wednesday night.

He caused a disturbance at the casino and fought with Buffalo police officers assigned there to provide security, Buffalo Police Department spokesman Michael DeGeorge said.

'He was abusive to the staff at the casino, and when officers tried to take him into custody, he bit one of them on the finger,' a police source told the Buffalo News.

The dad-of-four was arrested and will be charged with assault, criminal mischief and harassment.

Boynton was in town for Thursday's Coyotes and Sabres game a few blocks away at the First Niagara Center, the Sabres' home ice. 

But it looks like he won't be commentating on the game as he was placed on a leave of absence by the team following the incident.

Boynton joined the Coyotes' broadcast team in July 2014 after an 11-season career as a defenseman for six teams, including Arizona, skating in a total of 605 NHL games.

He also played for the Chicago Blackhawks when the team won the Stanley Cup in 2010. 

The native of Nobleton, Ontario married reporter and Realtor Jen Patterson in 2012 and has four young children, including two from a previous relationship.

Boynton, who was diagnosed with Type I diabetes at the age of 19, has also run 'Boynton Hock Camp' for youth hockey training in Vernon Hills, Illinois, according to his website.
