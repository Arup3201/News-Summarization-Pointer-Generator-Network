Motorists were seeing double yesterday after road chiefs put up a sign on a busy commuter road - identical to one just 20 feet away.

Drivers were left scratching their heads when they saw the two signs showing exactly the same information as each other despite being just metres apart.

But despite the identical notices on the A90 route on the outskirts of Aberdeen, Scotland, Bear Scotland, who manage and maintain the road, insisted they had not made a mistake.

Aberdeen: Drivers were scratching their heads 
when they saw the two signs with the same information

Just in case you missed it: The company say the existing sign will be moved in the next fortnight

A spokeswoman said: 'A new sign has been put up to accommodate new signage for a U-turn ban and junction warning signs.

'The existing sign that was there originally will be moved in the next fortnight.'

The second banner details how far away Stonehaven, Laurencekirk, Brechin, Forfar, Dundee and Perth are from the Granite City.

And when asked why the company could 
not just move the original sign Bear Scotland said that would deprive 
drivers of the necessary information while it was being moved.

She added: 'The whole idea is to have two signs so that no information is lost for the motorists while the the move takes place.

Two for one: Some drivers questioned their eyesight when they drove past the two identical signs

'It is normal to put the new sign up before the old one is taken down.'

One motorist said: 'I was just coming around the roundabout when I first saw the sign.

'I thought there was something wrong with my eyesight because just half a second later I saw exactly the same thing again.'
