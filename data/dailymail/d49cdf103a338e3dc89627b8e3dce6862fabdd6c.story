Ukip’s new MP Douglas Carswell was the subject of a behind-the-scenes plot to steal his seat in the House of Commons today – after a secret ambush was launched by Labour MPs.

A group of working class northern MPs – who call themselves the ‘awkward squad’ – sit on the Commons front bench to the left of Labour leader Ed Miliband. The prized position gives outspoken left-wingers the chance the barrack Tory MPs.

But after Mr Carswell was returned to the Commons as Ukip’s first elected MP last week he gate-crashed the Labour MPs’ prized spot – allowing him to attack the Government from one of the most prominent spots in the House.

Labour MPs arrived before Prime Minister's Questions today to grab the best seats so Douglas Carswell could not sit with them

The move caught Labour MPs off guard – with a group of Labour MPs last week refusing to take their position in the Commons because they were on strike in solidarity with civil servants union the PCS.

But the MPs caught out by Mr Carswell’s move organised an early ambush of the Commons ticket office to grab the best seats before the new Ukip MP arrived today.

Hard-left MP Grahame Morris put in his request for a seat at 8am this morning alongside other members of the awkward group.

The group included veteran MP Dennis Skinner, and a contingent of North East MPs including Ronnie Campbell, Grahame Morris and Ian Mearns. Liverpool MP Steve Rotherham was also present.

But there plot was rendered pointless after Mr Carswell failed to show up - choosing to go campaigning in Rochester for Tory defector Mark Reckless instead.

One of the MPs told MailOnline that Mr Carswell was trying to win northern votes for Ukip by sitting with working class Labour members.

He said: ‘There’s no way we are going to let him sit with us and claim he is one of us. He is more Tory than the Tories.’

Another gleeful MP declared: 'There's no room at the inn for UKippers.'
