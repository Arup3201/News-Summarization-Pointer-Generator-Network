Levante have warned Atletico Madrid that Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas will not leave on the cheap - and that they will have to up their offer to sign the World Cup star.

Navas has been in sensational form throughout the tournament for Costa Rica, decisively saving Greek striker Theofanis Gekas' spot-kick to seal a quarter-final spot against Holland for his country.

He also made eight saves during the match and has conceded just twice during the tournament as unfancied Costa Rica topped Group D - containing England, Italy and Uruguay.

Wanted: Levante have told Atletico Madrid to up their offer for Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas

Clause: Atleti have offered £5m plus Brazil striker Leo Baptistao but Levante want Navas' £8m buy-out fee

The stopper has 12 months remaining on his £5,000-a-week Levante contract but he will not be allowed to leave until Atletico or another club match his £8million buy-out clause.

Atleti need a goalkeeper to replace Belgian Thibaut Courtois, who spent three years at the club before returning to parent club Chelsea at the start of this summer.

They are believed to have offered £5m plus Brazilian forward Leo Baptistao for Navas, but Levante want more.

Speaking to Spanish radio station Cadena Ser, Levante president Quico Catalan said: 'Keylor has a 10million euro release clause and we know that Keylor is worth more than that.

'All the teams that have made offers for Keylor know what the answer will be - the release clause.

'Six million euros plus Leo Baptistao is not 10million.

'Keylor
 is having a great World Cup and many clubs, foreign and Spanish, have 
shown their interest.'

In safe hands: Navas saved the decisive spot-kick in the last-16 match against Greece

Navas also performed brilliantly during Levante's shock 2-0 victory over eventual champions Atleti in La Liga last season.

Speaking on the same radio programme, Navas gave no indication about his preferred future destination.

'The
 most important thing for me right now is the World Cup,' said the 
goalkeeper.

'I will evaluate other things later, I just want to enjoy the 
World Cup.'
