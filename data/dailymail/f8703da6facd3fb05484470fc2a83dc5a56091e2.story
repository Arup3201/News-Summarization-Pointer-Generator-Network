This is the shocking moment a reckless father and his young son took shelter from 30ft waves after they walked out to a perilous stack of rocks during a vicious storm.

The pair wandered 50ft away from the main coastal path in Portland, Dorset, to the outcrop known as Pulpit Rock, and were left exposed to the high winds and choppy seas.

As the powerful waves broke around them, the father grabbed hold of the boy, aged about 11, and stood up against one side of the giant rock.

Shocking: The pair are thought to have gone for a walk during extreme storms and wandered 50ft from the main coastal path in Portland, Dorset

Perilous: As the powerful waves broke over the front of the huge stack of stones, the father grabbed hold of the boy, aged about 11

The large waves crashed around them; leaving the pair soaking wet while a stunned passer-by stopped and photographed the scene.

A spokesman from Portland Coastguard said: 'Had the pair been struck directly by a wave they would have been washed away.

'They placed themselves at a significant risk by doing that.'

Police and coastguards have repeatedly warned sightseers to stay away from the sea front during the dramatic storms.

The RNLI warned people not to take any chances and said the behaviour had been irresponsible.

James
 Millidge, RNLI community incident reduction manager in the south west, 
said: 'Ducking waves at any time is not only foolhardy but extremely 
dangerous - including for those RNLI volunteers who may have to come to 
the rescue you if the sea washes people away.

'The sea is far more powerful than people think and the chances of survival are slim for people who are dragged in to the swell.

'There's the risk of drowning, of dying from cold water shock or from being battered back on to the rocks by the crashing waves.

'We understand why people want to experience extreme weather, but we would urge folk to do it from a safe distance.'

Risk: The large waves crashed around the pair as they stood helplessly on the rock. A spokesman for the coastguard said if they had been directly by the water, they could have been washed away

Exposed: The father and son were spotted by a stunned passer-by who stopped to photograph the horrifying scene

Yesterday, a man perched on the edge of the coast in Bude, Devon, as waves came down over his head.

The
 unidentified man was wearing a suit as he left himself vulnerable to 
the vicious conditions during the extreme weather which has impacted 
Britain since Christmas.

Onlookers were horrified as the man stood for 15-20 minutes in weather that has claimed lives and torn apart homes.

Stupid: A man clad in a suit looks sharp but then stands on the coast in Bude as perilous wave crash overhead

Bewildered: Onlookers were shocked to see him being drenched in the storm as emergency services blast storm tourists

Julia Devitt, who saw the man joking with his friend, said: 'We couldn't quite believe what we saw. There on the edge of the sea pool wall was a man dressed in a suit.

'He was with someone else who we presume was taking photos or video from the relative safety of the steps.

'This man kept coming back to pose, long after we thought it was safe to do so. It was scary.'

In January a family in Cornwall narrowly escaped 
being swept into the sea when a 20ft wave washed over them as they were 
walking along a sea wall.

At
Mullion Cove in which is almost the southernmost point in all
of Britain, a father, mother and three young children were photographed
walking along a barrier when a 20ft wave came over the top of the wall,
drenching all four members of the family.
