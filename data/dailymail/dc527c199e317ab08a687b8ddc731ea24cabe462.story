The exact details of the birth of the new royal baby next month will be forever shrouded in mystery.

However, one thing is certain, unlike many other queens-in-waiting, the Duchess of Cambridge will have a fleet of medical staff and a range of drug options available to her to ensure the arrival of the new prince or princess is as pain-free as possible.

By contrast, when Queen Elizabeth I was born in 1533, giving birth was considered such a dangerous practice, women were encouraged to write their wills.

The evolution of childbirth: By the 1940s, men were increasingly present at the birth although the advent of the NHS in 1948, meant that more mothers than ever before were now having their babies in hospital. This vintage illustration  shows a proud father meeting his newborn twins circa 1952

Men were banished from the delivery room, as were doctors, and midwives - who had learned their trade from their own mothers - were the experts, rubbing ointment on the swollen bellies of their patients to speed up delivery and sprinkling herbs over the floor  to make it smell nice and help the mothers relax.

Scottish historian Ashley Cowie, who has appeared on NBC's  Legend Quest, said women were often afraid of giving birth as they feared they would die.

He said: 'In the 15th century it was not unusual for girls to be married between the ages of 15 and 19 and the average number of children born to one mother was between five and seven.

'Childbirth was a dangerous time in a woman's life, and most wrote wills when they knew they were pregnant.  

'An ancient method of birth control was to extend breastfeeding, which is nature's way of spacing out children.'

He added that upper class mothers hired women to feed their babies. 'The hand that rocked the cradle was closer to the truth than you would imagine and among the upper classes it was common to have wet nurses breastfeed so that the mother would soon be pregnant again.

Meanwhile, having babies in the Middle Ages was shrouded in superstition and folklore.

He said: 'Several rituals surrounded medieval childbirth, including the burning of the newborn's umbilical cord. Fire was seen as a way of purifying the sinful origins of conception.'

Mothers and midwives also used special birthing chairs, which women believed put them in the best position possible to deliver their baby. 

Leah Astbury, who is studying for a doctorate at Cambridge University and researching maternal and infant health in 17th century England, said: 'Women gave birth at home, assisted by a midwife and a group of female friends, neighbours and family members, called gossips. When her labour began, it was often her husband’s job to fetch them.

During the 16th century, even queens (Henry VIII's wives Jane Seymour and Katherine Parr) weren't immune from the lack of understanding about cleanliness, and both died of puerperal fever, a septic infection of the reproductive organs that always resulted in death.

'At the birth, herbal remedies and a drink called caudle, a kind of fortifying alcoholic porridge or eggnog, were commonly drunk to keep her strong during the birth, and possibly dull the pain.

'Seventeenth century women often expressed a complex relationship with the pain of labour. On the one hand, childbirth had the potential to be redemptive. It was part of Eve’s penance.

'In reality, however, families were obviously relieved when women gave birth relatively easily and recovered quickly.'

In 1672, physician Percival Willughby wrote Observations in Midwifery, a book about contemporary labour practices.

He wrote: 'Let all midwives bee assured, that it is not their labours, in pulling, and haling their women’s bodies, that causeth deliver. But that it is the work of Dame nature.'

Remarking on one case, he wrote: 'Her mother-in-law was a midwife, and had used her very harshly; through her unhandsome doings, her body was much bruised, and, by her pulling the infant by the arme, shee had destroyed the infants life...' 

The medical man notes that placenta was placed on the baby’s head  to prevent sore eyes, while at the time there were few tools and a hook called a 'crotchet' was employed to pull out, often dead, babies.

By the time Queen Victoria was crowned in 1837, male doctors could be present at births although they were not supposed to look at their patients, just touch them.

Having borne nine children, Queen Victoria became an expert at childbirth and is said to have persuaded Prince Albert to attend the births, using chloroform as a pain relief for eighth and ninth children.

By 1914, pain control during labour was an option, although one technique, using a morphine-type drug called Twilight Sleep, which knocked women  out and erased the memory of what they'd gone through.

While the idea of giving birth in a stupor might have appealed to some women, there were risks to both mother and baby.

By the 1940s, men were increasingly present at the birth although the advent of the NHS in 1948, meant that more mothers than ever before were now having their babies in hospital.

The biggest shift in attitude to childbirth and pregnancy arrived kicking and screaming in the 1970s.

Arguable for the first time, conception, pregnancy and childbirth were embraced as something that could be modified to suit the individual.

Some women claim their doctors advised them not to give up smoking as it would help them relax during pregnancy, while mothers with a low iron count were advised to drink a pint of Guinness.

It was also customary for mothers to be given an enema to 'clear them out' and women were routinely given a vaginal shave for 'hygenic reasons'.

Breast feeding was encouraged and smoking was allowed on the ward.

Men also had the choice whether to attend the birth or not, although many fathers-to-be still deemed that a labour ward was not the place for men and spent the time at the pub instead, ready to wet the baby's head.

Times have changed yet again, and as the Duke of Cambridge gets ready to welcome his new child, it would be surprising if he chose not to attend the birth, lit a congratulatory cigarette next to his wife or took her a pint of Guinness for medicinal purposes.
