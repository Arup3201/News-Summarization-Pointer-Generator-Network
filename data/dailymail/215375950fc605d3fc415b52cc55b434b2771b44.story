Paul Scholes has raised questions over Arsene Wenger's tactical preparations after Arsenal's comprehensive defeat against Borussia Dortmund in midweek.

The Gunners were outplayed in the 2-0 loss against Dortmund, and Scholes suggested that Wenger may not have watched any videos of the German side.

Scholes claims that Arsenal's attempts to play their own game regardless of the opposition are only useful if they're winning every game, but need to be adapted under more difficult circumstances.

'I do wonder how much Arsenal look at videos of the opposition in their preparation for games like the one they played on Tuesday,' Scholes wrote in the Evening Standard.

'Watching the match it seemed like they hand't given Dortmund much more than a moment's consideration. 

'All Wenger and Arsenal appear to think about is how they are going to approach the game and how they will play. 

'Which is fine if you win all the time but not if - like Arsenal - you haven't made it out of the Champions League's last 16 for the previous four seasons.' 

Arsene Wenger only cares about how his own team will set up, which is to their detriment, says Scholes

Scholes also said Mesut Ozil shouldn't has been under par on the left wing, but Arsene Wenger has defended his team's approach, and hit back against criticism of his playmaker. 

'It’s a bit unfair because I believe that our offensive talents on Tuesday night [against Borussia Dortmund] were not in their best condition, and they couldn’t express that talent,' said Wenger.

'On the other hand it’s post-World Cup. He came back on August 11. You know it takes a few months for them to get back to their best, that can happen.

'They should not be concerned and just support him. I understand that you want your best players always to make the difference in every single game and we all go through period where we are a bit less good. You help.

'A club is a union between players, supporters and directors. You have to be united and sometimes go through periods together where it goes a bit less well.'

Scholes suggested that the formation Arsenal are currently playing, with Ozil often playing out on the wing, does not suit the German's talents. But Wenger believes that is merely a side issue.

'That's a secondary debate in my opinion because he has freedom to play when we have the ball and go where he wants,' he added. 'If you look at the heat map where he plays, you will be amazed where he is all over the pitch.

Ozil was out on the wing against Dortmund and failed to have a significant impact on the game

Despite struggling Arsenal did create chances, but Danny Welbeck missed their best opportunities

'Why should he be a scapegoat? For what? We've lost one game since April 1. Let's be realistic. We've come out of a very difficult preparation period with decisive games. We had very difficult games against Besiktas. I don't know a scapegoat for what?

'What is difficult to manage today is that everybody knows absolutely everything and everybody judges people definitely on one game. You have to accept that football is played by human beings who have ups and downs like you have in your life.'
