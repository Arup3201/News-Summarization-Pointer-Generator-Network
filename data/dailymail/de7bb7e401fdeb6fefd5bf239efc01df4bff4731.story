A former model who lost her good looks after becoming hooked on drugs and whose boyfriend shot dead a police officer has been released from jail after accepting a plea agreement. 

Traci Vaillancourt was sitting in a car with her boyfriend Timothy Troy Walker when police Sergeant Derek Johnson approached the Volvo in Draper, Utah, on September 1, 2013.

Walker shot Johnson dead and turned his weapon on Ms Vaillancourt, seriously wounding her before failing to kill himself.

Prosecutors initially charged Ms Vaillancourt, 35, with two felony counts of obstructing justice, claiming that she was trying to cover up her involvement in Sgt Johnson's murder.

Ms Vaillancourt has spent the past 15 months in custody awaiting trial, however a last-minute plea agreement has seen her released in time for Christmas. 

Her boyfriend Walker has already pleaded guilty to Sgt Johnson's murder and has been sentenced to life in prison. 

Ms Vaillancourt told Fox13.com: 'I feel like I`ve been rung out like a rag yet exhilaratingly refreshed, I feel great, it hasn`t hit me yet actually.' 

Her lawyer Matthew Kober said: 'She wanted to minimize potential risk and that’s why she made the decision to proceed with the plea today, to secure her release before Christmas.'

Sgt Johnson's widow, Shante,  said she was happy Ms Vaillancourt had accepted a plea agreement to avoid  a potentially painful trial.

She said: 'So relieved that our family doesn’t have to face that, worry about that, go through the emotional drama of that and re-drudge all the details of that day again.'

Under the terms of the deal, Ms Vaillancourt will spend the next 36 months on probation. If she completes her probation successfully, her felony charges will be reduced to a misdemeanor. However, if she re-offends, she risks being returned to prison. 

Ms Vaillancourt's family said she had been a popular model in high school but was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder after the birth of her first child. 

Her sister Victoria King revealed in an earlier interview with KSL.com.  

She says her sister quickly became addicted to her pain medication after suffering four strokes before the age of 30.

'It just went downhill from there,' King told the broadcaster.

'I tried to get him away from her. She chose a different path. … He was bad news from the get-go, I knew it, and the two of them combined, and a loaded gun nonetheless, and strung out on drugs.'

'We tried and tried and tried to help her but you can't help someone who won't help themself,' she added.

King last saw her sister and Walker the day before the shootings and was left startled by his behavior.

'He got out of the car and he was hyper, showing me a gun that has a laser and a machete and knives,' she said.

The couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister. 

In the weeks before Sgt Johnson's murder, Walker and Vaillancourt were living out of motels and sleeping in their car.
