Unemployment has fallen by almost half a million over the past year in the biggest drop for more than 25 years, official figures revealed this morning.

The number of people out of work now stands at just over 2 million, after 146,000 found jobs in the last three months and some 468,000 over the past year.

In a further boost to the Government, employment jumped by 774,000 to 30.61 million while the number of people on the dole dropped below one million after 22 months of consecutive falls.

Unemployment has been falling rapidly since 2011 and is now just above 6 per cent - the lowest for six years 

The proportion of the workforce without a job is highest in the North East and West Midland, while the South East, East, South West, East Midlands and Scotland enjoy below-average rates of unemployment

Today’s figures, released by the Office for National Statistics, also reveal that unemployment in Scotland – now at 6 per cent – is below the national average after 87,000 people found work over the past year.

The unemployment rate across the UK is now 6.2 per cent – a six year low and down from 7.7 per cent just a year earlier.

Ministers also trumpeted figures showing public sector employment falling to its lowest level on record - at 5.4million.

Today's figures also show a continued growth in private sector employment - up by almost 800,000 in the last year alone. Compared to 2010 there are now over 2.16 million more people in private sector jobs.

Young people saw the largest annual fall in unemployment since records began in 1984 – falling by 213,000 on the year – and has been dropping for the last year.

There are now fewer young people claiming the main unemployment benefit – job seekers’ allowance - than just before the recession – having dropped by 133,200 in the past year and for 33 months in a row.

But Labour said pay - including bonuses - for workers was just 0.6 per cent higher than a year ago.

Stephen Timms, Labour’s Shadow Employment Minister, said: ‘Today's fall in overall unemployment is welcome, but the new figures have shown working people are seeing their pay falling far behind the cost of living.

‘Pay excluding bonuses today is the lowest on record. Under this Government wages after inflation have already fallen by over £1,600 a year since 2010 and by next year working people will have seen the biggest fall in wages of any Parliament since 1874.

‘A Labour government will freeze gas and electricity bills, raise the minimum wage and get more homes built to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.’

Britain's jobs boom has seen it keep pace with US unemployment falls, while Europe lags behind with 10 per cent of its workforce on the dole

But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘Creating jobs is central to building a stronger, more resilient and stable economy.

‘With millions more people in private sector employment under this Government, it is clear that our long-term economic plan is helping Britain to recover following one of the deepest recessions in living memory.

‘All of our reforms are focussed on helping people off benefits and into work – giving people the peace of mind and security that comes with a steady income.

‘With the number of people claiming the main unemployment benefit down below 1 million for the first time in 6 years, we are helping people to break free from welfare dependency, look after themselves and their families, and play their part in getting our country back to work.’
