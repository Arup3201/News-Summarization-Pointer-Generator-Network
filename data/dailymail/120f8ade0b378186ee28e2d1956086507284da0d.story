Most brides have a dream wedding that they try to create for their special day.

For this bride, it's perhaps questionable whether this was what she envisioned for her wedding day for all those years.

Regardless, it's clear from the beaming smiles on the faces of both the bride and groom, as they stand knee deep in freezing, flowing waters of a salmon river in Alaska, that this is the perfect wedding for them.

Groomsmen holding fly fishing rods watch as Kadie and Dake Schmidt exchanged their vows, knee deep in a salmon river in Alaska

Bridesmaids look on as Kadie and Dake Schmidt, right, exchange a kiss at the end of their wedding ceremony

Flanked by supportive bridesmaids and groomsmen, wearing protective long waders, the happy couple exchanged their vows to the sound of the running river in the remote but beautiful setting.

Kadie Walsh and Dake Schmidt, both local fishing guides, opted for a rather nontraditional salmon fishing theme for their entire wedding.

The couple's rings were presented each in the mouths of two king salmon and both the bridesmaids and groomsmen were carrying fishing rods complete with flower posies throughout the ceremony.

Stunning setting: It was arguably a beautiful setting for the ceremony, with Pillar Mountain in the background. The majority of the wedding party kept their feet dry, watching from the shoreline

Unafraid of getting their hands messy, the couple then caught their own pair of pink salmon to commemorate their special union

Shortly after the newlyweds were married, they were each handed a rod and both caught their own pair of handsome pink salmon on the Buskin River, on Alaska's southern Kodiak island.

While marrying in the freezing fishy waters of a fast-flowing river in Alaska might not be everyone's cup of tea for their special ceremony, Mr and Mrs Schmidt, it appears, couldn't have been happier with the arrangement.

The setting might be unusual but some elements of the special day followed the traditional course, including Kadie's minor make-up touch-ups from the bridesmaids

Impressed: Clearly enjoying the salmon-themed wedding, one groomsman stopped to watch with awe as two large king salmon are removed from the ceremony
