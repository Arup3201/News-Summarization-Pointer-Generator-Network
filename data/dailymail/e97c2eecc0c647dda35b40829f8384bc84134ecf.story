Parents eager to get their children into the best kindergartens are going to ever greater lengths, and often cracking under pressure in the process, according to top therapists.

Some psychologists say the stress is so crushing and the competition for spots in Manhattan's best institutions so cutthroat that parents are willing to move elsewhere.

'Parenting is a competitive sport. We’re trying to provide parents respite from that,' Dr. Lisa Spiegel, a downtown therapist who runs the Soho Parenting center, told the New York Post.

Spiegel said parents who seek her help often spend most of their 90-minute sessions talking about their fear of failing their children.

One advice she offers her clients is avoiding some of the more competitive mothers - the kind that fret over bringing the right designer bag on a school tour. 

Dana Haddad, a New York admissions consultant, said her client meetings sometimes resemble a session with a psychoanalyst, or a fashion consultant.

Haddad revealed that one family was so nervous about school interviews that she was asked to pick out the tie for the father.

A common question that admissions specialists face is whether parents should dress their toddlers in suits for the big interview.

In a more extreme turn, Haddad said one pregnant client asked about inducing early labor so that her newborn could be considered for kindergarten before the September 1 deadline.

In another case, Haddad said a single mother pretended to be a lesbian in an effort to make her child's application stand out.

The pressure of getting their children into good schools can prove too much not only for the parents' psyche, but also for their marriage, according to counselors.

A Manhattan psychologist said a mother was so distraught when her nervous husband made a slightly inappropriate joke during a school tour that she turned on him during a session.
