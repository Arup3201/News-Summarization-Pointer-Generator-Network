Ashley Williams has warned Swansea they will continue to drop points unless they find a way to take the strain off Wilfried Bony.

Bony has been their standout player this season, netting eight times after a stunning 25-goal debut season.

No other Swansea player has scored more than three Premier League goals and Williams admitted there is a concern that not enough players beside the Ivorian are taking their chances.

Asked if it was a worry, Williams said: 'It is. We need to chip in with more goals as a team. We need to find goals from other places on the pitch.'

It's been a peculiar season for Swansea. They have been comfortably within the top 10 until now but have coughed 16 points from winning positions.

They never led in the 2-1 defeat against Tottenham on Sunday but wasted numerous chances, with Williams believing they need to be more clinical in front of goal.

Bony cancelled out Harry Kane's fourth minute opener buy a late Christian Eriksen goal secured the win 

He said: 'All of us, Wilf included, get a lot of chances and if we go 2-0 up I a sure that we can win the game. We have got this record from losing from winning positions, but I’m pretty sure that all of them have been one goal and there have been games where we’ve had a lot of chances after we scored the first goal.

'It’s pretty simple really - we need to convert the chances but I don’t know how we do that, how we change that, it is what it is. I just think the chances we get, the positions we find ourselves in, we have to take them.

'I don’t think we have scored from a set pieces ourselves. We have got a lot of height in team and we all have to do better. When you say we have to take our chances you do look at the guys up front as that’s what they do, but as a team we need to share the goals around.'
