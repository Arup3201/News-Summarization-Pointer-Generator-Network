A 'dangerous' thief who told a policewoman he is HIV positive before stabbing her in the arm with a hypodermic needle has been jailed for almost three years.

The incident was the third time Polish shoplifter Grzegorz Pajak, 28, had brandished a hypodermic needle when caught stealing, and the fourth time he had used his HIV status as 'a weapon', a court heard.

Pc Gemma Newman - who attended a Boots store where Pajak had been caught shoplifting aftershave - is considering leaving front line policing as a result of 'deep psychological distress' caused by the attack, Gloucester Crown Court was told.

'Dangerous man': Grzegorz Pajak will be deported back to Poland after he has served his jail sentence, Gloucester Crown Court heard

Persistent thief Pajak - who will be deported to Poland once he has served his sentence - also once spat on a police officer who arrested him, and had twice been armed with knives when he went out shoplifting.

Pajak pleaded guilty to unlawfully wounding Pc Newman on 29 July this year, and to stealing a quantity of aftershave from Boots in Eastgate Street, Gloucester, on the same date.

Prosecutor Giles Nelson said the police officer is now living with the fear that she may have been infected with HIV.

She has had tests which have already proved negative for hepatitis C but is still awaiting further test results.

Judge Jamie Tabor QC jailed Pajak for 32 months after hearing that - because of the scale and seriousness of his offending in the UK over the last five years - he will be deported by the UK Borders Agency at the end of his term.

'You have caused the officer deep psychological distress by what you did,' the judge told Pajak.

'It has caused further distress in that she has reacted adversely to some of the medication she has been given to counter what you did to her.

'This was the third time you produced a needle when you were caught shoplifting and the fourth time you have used your HIV status as a weapon.

'You have spat on someone on one occasion and on two other occasions prior to that you were armed with a knife.

'You are a dangerous man, of that there is no doubt in my mind at all.

'Since coming to this country you have been perpetually immersed in criminal activity and causing serious inconvenience and worse.

The judge added: 'I am very pleased to hear that the UK Borders Agency are going to send you back to your homeland once you have served your sentence.'

Pajak lashed out at the police officer after he was caught shoplifting aftershave from Boots in Gloucester

The court heard that Pc Newman was called to the Boots branch after a store detective caught Pajak shoplifting and detained him.

The security officer warned that Pajak had a needle. Moments later Pajak said: ‘I’m going to f*****g stab you. I’ve got HIV.'

He then lashed out and punctured the officer’s arm with the needle.

Pc
Newman said in a statement read out in court that it was the most 
frightening incident she had been involved in during her four and a half
year police career.

'This was without question the most frightening incident I have been involved in,' her statement said.

'I had never been confronted with a needle before and I was extremely scared.

'I
have been left questioning whether I want to continue working as a 
front line police officer as this incident has affected me so much.

'I am wondering what psychological effect this will have on my both personally and professionally.'

Pajak was jailed for 32 months after pleading guilty to unlawful wounding and theft at Gloucester Crown Court

The
court was told that Pajak arrived in the UK between 2005 and 2007, and 
that his criminal record in the country dates back to 2007.

The prolific shoplifter has been before the courts 27 times.

Paul
Cook, defending, said Pajak was ashamed and remorseful about what he 
had done to the police officer and had written her a letter five days 
after her arrest to assure her that the needle was clean and that she 
was not at risk of disease.

The root of his client's problem was heroin addiction dating back to 2008, Mr Cook said.
