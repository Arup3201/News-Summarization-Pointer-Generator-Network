Stunning footage captured by a 10-year-old girl shows the incredible moment when lioness Kashifa rescued one of her cubs from falling into a moat at Zoo Miami.

Kashifa, who has five cubs in her pride, is seen in the video carefully going down a steep embankment and grabbing the 4-month-old cub by its back, slowly rescuing the little guy from harm's way.

Onlookers at Zoo Miami held a collective breath while mama lion brought her cub back up — and broke out in cheers when she rescued him.

Afterward, 
the rest of the pride welcomed the cub back with comforting licks, said 
10-year-old Amanda Carmeli, who captured the footage, WPLG reported.

'The zoo is set up so the animals aren’t 
in cages,' spokesman Ron Magill told ABC News, pointing out that this isn't the first time one of the cubs has fallen into the moat.

'They’re out in 
open-moated exhibits so there’s no barrier to prevent them from going 
into the moat,' he added.

'It was always a concern of ours that the cubs 
may fall in the moat, so before they were let out in the exhibit they 
were each swim-tested.'

Kashifa had four cubs of her own last year. She began looking after her nephew Kwasi when her sister, Asha, died a few months after giving birth

Zoo Miami last year celebrated the birth of lion cubs for the first time in its 33 years. Staff say that the cubs are quite happy playing around in their habitat, though every once in a while one falls into the moat — requiring a rescue from mama

Kashifa
 has been caring for the cubs since last September, when Zoo Miami 
celebrated the birth of three lions for the first time in its 33-year 
history.

A total of five new lions were born at the zoo by December, when Kwasi was born to Kashifa's sister, Asha.

But tragedy struck a few months after, when Asha died.

Zoo staff say that Kashifa is a fierce lioness, always watching to make sure nothing happens to her five cubs

The big-hearted Kashifa took her nephew into her own pride and has been taking care of Kwasi ever since.

'We were confident that the lion 
was a good mother,' Magill told ABC News. 'She had demonstrated to us before that
 she would go into the water to rescue her cubs and she proved it once 
again in this video.'
