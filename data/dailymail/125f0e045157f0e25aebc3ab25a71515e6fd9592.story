Jailed: Dr Michael Salmon, 80, faces his final years in prison after he was convicted of 11 sex attacks on six girls he was treating and jailed for 18 years

A ‘Cold-blooded and ruthless’ doctor who sexually assaulted patients as young as 12 at the hospital at the centre of the Jimmy Savile scandal has been jailed for 18 years.

Michael Salmon, 80, was convicted of a string of rapes and indecent assaults on seriously ill patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where Savile abused scores of youngsters at the same time.

Salmon, a renowned children’s doctor who was praised by Princess Diana for his charity work, lured a 16-year-old girl to his home where he raped her in his bedroom. 

Other vulnerable teenagers were molested between 1980 and 1988, often while their unsuspecting parents sat on the other side of a screen at the Buckinghamshire hospital.

It can now be revealed that Salmon has enjoyed the lifestyle of a country gentleman for the past decade on an NHS pension worth as much as £100,000 a year – despite being struck off from the medical register in 1991.

He was jailed for 18 months in November 1990 after admitting indecently assaulting three girls as young as 12. 

But on his release from Grendon Underwood Prison, he reinvented himself as a wildlife expert and bought a £700,000, four-bedroom home in the picturesque village of Woodgreen on the edge of the New Forest National Park where no one knew of his past.

There, Salmon told neighbours he was a distinguished retired hospital consultant who hailed from a family of esteemed doctors descended from aristocracy.

The twice-married father of two quickly established himself in the community, becoming a member of the golf club and a regular attendee at church. 

Abuse: Six victims who were being treated at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the 1980s fell into the clutches of Salmon who indecently assaulted and raped girls as young as 12

He insisted on being addressed as ‘Dr’ in his church and golf club circles, where he said he was descended directly from the Duke of Northumberland and claimed to be a world expert on butterflies who advised the Natural History Museum.

But he remained far from popular in the village, where he was described as ‘sneery’, ‘pompous’ and ‘haughty’. 

One resident said: ‘He told us he was related to the Percy family of Northumberland. He went up to Alnwick Castle and he said he could see the family likeness in the portraits.’

Salmon claimed to be a wildlife expert, having travelled to Zambia in 1984 with the BBC Natural History Unit.

He boasted how he had published a book on British butterflies and claimed he regularly visited the Natural History Museum in London to give advice. 

But when contacted by the Mail, the museum said it had never heard of him.

Marriage: Salmon's wife Susie, pictured together last month, has stood by her husband despite the terrible abuse, but was not in court to see him jailed 

It wasn’t until the Savile scandal erupted that the true scale of Salmon’s offending emerged when new victims came forward.

But residents in his village had long held suspicions, with one neighbour telling the Mail: ‘I thought he was a dirty old man.’

Yesterday a judge at Reading Crown Court said Salmon was a predatory paedophile as she sentenced him for two rapes and nine indecent assaults on six girls between 1980 and 1988.

Judge Johanna Cutts QC said: ‘These are the actions that breached, in the most heinous way, what the medical profession stands for. This was someone who was cold and calculating.

‘It was your conceited arrogance that led to your downfall.

‘All the girls were ill at the time. They were treated as objects for your sexual gratification.’

Speaking about the 16-year-old victim whom he raped in his home, the judge said: ‘You raped her at a time when she couldn’t have been more vulnerable. 

'This court sees a lot of rape cases. It is rare to see such cold-blooded and ruthless behaviour as against this girl.’

As his victims wept in the public gallery yesterday, Salmon – who had a picture of Savile on the wall of his office – remained stony-faced. 

He betrayed no emotion as he listened to moving victim impact statements from the women, one of whom said she suffered nightmares and another who said she couldn’t get Salmon’s face ‘out of her head’.

Jessica Standley, an abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon which represented two of his victims, said: ‘The crimes he committed were among the most despicable imaginable. 

'This case raises serious questions about the culture at Stoke Mandeville Hospital at the time Jimmy Savile and Salmon were there.’
