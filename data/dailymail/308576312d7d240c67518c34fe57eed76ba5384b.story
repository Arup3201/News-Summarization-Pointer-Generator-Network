Helen and Joe Auer have been inseparable for seven decades, and even death proved no match for their unbreakable, one-in-a-million bond.

Helen Auer, from Cincinnati, Ohio, passed away peacefully at home last Wednesday at age 94.

On the night of her death, Joe entered her room, gave her one final kiss goodbye and whispered to her, 'Helen, call me home.'

And just 28 hours later, Helen did call him to her.

Storybook romance: Joe and Helen Auer, pictured, passed away only 28 hours apart last week after 73 years of marriage 

Long life: Mr Auer, a World War II hero, died at age 100, preceded by his 94-year-old wife. He celebrated his birthday in May 

Picture perfect: Joe and Helen met at church in Cincinnati and got married in 1941 (left). A short time later, their first child, Barry, was born 

Joe Auer died last Friday, five months after celebrating his 100th birthday. The couple's nine surviving children knew their dad could not make it without their mom for more than a night, reported the Cincinnati Enquirer. 

The Auers married at St. Lawrence Church in Cincinnati in 1941.

On Wednesday, the couple who survived the Great Depression, lived through World War II, raised 10 children and witnessed the births of their 16 grandchildren, 29 great-grandkids and one great-great grandchild, will be back in front of the same alter where they had exchanged their vows 73 years earlier, only this time for a funeral Mass.

Helen Auer, nee Fluegeman, had her first baby, Barry, soon after the wedding and was pregnant with their second child, Judy, by the time Joe shipped out to fight the Nazis in faraway Europe.

Eager to have Joe see their new baby, Helen sent him a photo of herself with their two young children.

Hero: Mr Auer went to war while his wife was pregnant with their second child and took part in the D-Day invasion, landing at Utah Beach in occupied France 

Salt of the earth: The Auers, hardworking and devout, had 10 children together, which meant that money was always tight 

Joe Auer had that precious black-and-white picture tucked in his pocket when he landed at Utah Beach on D-Day, and it did not leave his side for the remainder of the war - and for the rest of his life.

Jerry Auer, the couple's 10th and final child, told the Cincinnati Enquirer that the threadbare, yellowed photograph was still in his father's wallet when he drew his last breath last week.

Helen Auer was described by her children as the outgoing and spirited one in the family - a woman who loved keeping busy and spending time with loved ones.

By contrast, their daughter Mary Joe Reiners described her father as a stern and serious man – the disciplinarian in the family - who was guided by his Christian faith and his profound sense of responsibility.

According to Reiners, the environment was also very important to her father, and he had made sure to impart to his children the importance of taking good care of God’s Earth.

All in the family: The couple witnessed the births of 16 grandchildren, 29 great-grandkids and one great-great grandchild

Bond forged in love: When Helen passed away at age 94 on October 15, her husband whispered to her, 'call me home, Helen' 

Crazy in love: The Auers' children knew that their father could not make it without their mom for more than one night 

After serving his country in Europe for three years during the war, Auer returned home to Helen and found work as an engraver.

With their family growing from one year to the next money was always tight but the Auers, frugal, humble and hardworking, always managed somehow.

After sending off their youngest child to third grade, Helen joined the workforce to help Joe out, taking a job as a lunch lady at the St Lawrence Parish school.

It was not until Joe retired that he, a child of the Depression, felt like he could finally afford to buy his first car.

In photos of Helen and Joe shared by their family on the website of Meyer Funeral Home, the two appear deeply in love, dancing at family celebrations, posing side by side for pictures, or kissing on the couch like a pair of love-sick teens.

'They were simple, humble people. They wanted nothing and got everything in return,' Jerry Auer, 52, told the paper of his late parents.
