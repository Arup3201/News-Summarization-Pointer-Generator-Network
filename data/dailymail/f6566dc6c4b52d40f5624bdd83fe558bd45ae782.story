Frustration: Tory MP Anne McIntosh hung up on a 111 call centre worker after 15 minutes of 'completely inappropriate' questioning

A Tory MP has revealed how the NHS 111 helpline let down her dying father – a retired GP – in his hour of need.

Anne McIntosh, 58, said she called the number after he developed worrying symptoms suggesting he had an infection.

Despite pleading to be put through to a doctor or nurse, she was made to answer a series of ‘completely inappropriate’ questions by an unqualified worker ‘sticking religiously to the script’.

After 15 minutes, the MP hung up ‘in sheer frustration’ and dialled 999 hoping to call out an ambulance. But as her father was so frail, paramedics were reluctant to transport him to the hospital 20 miles away and instead arranged for a GP to visit.

The doctor did not arrive for another three hours and her father died from the urinary infection four days later.

The Mail has repeatedly drawn attention to the failings of the helpline and the shocking state of out-of-hours care in our series The Out-of-Hours Debacle.

The new phone service, which is meant to provide round-the-clock medical advice, has replaced NHS Direct and local GP out-of-hours numbers.

Depending on a patient’s condition, they will either be told to go to A&E, given an appointment at a GP clinic or offered medical advice over the phone.

But many people are being put through to call centre workers with just a few weeks training, who can only use a computer system to assess the severity of their illness.

The MP – who is also a lawyer – acknowledged that her father’s death would have been very difficult to prevent.

However, she said that both her father and her family had been failed by the helpline.

‘What is particularly poignant for me and my family is that my father had been a local GP in that area for some 30 years,’ she said.

‘He attended patients in all weathers and at all hours. My father was from a generation of GPs who were used to working all hours. He worked every other night on call and every other weekend on duty.

‘And he always made sure he put his patients first. It is obviously a source of some regret that he did not have similar access to a GP in his own hour of need.’

The MP for Thirsk and Malton, North Yorkshire, recounted her experience during a debate about the helpline in the Commons earlier this week.

She had been visiting her father in County Durham – one of a handful of ‘pilot’ areas where the helpline has been running since 2010.

She said: ‘When I called 111 I got the ritual reply of sticking very closely to a script, which I found completely inappropriate at times.  I explained my father’s condition but the responder insisted on sticking religiously to the script – asking whether the patient was breathing, whether they were bleeding.

‘I kept saying that I was not reporting an accident but a regular condition, the symptoms of which were extremely plain, and asking whether I could, please, just be passed to a nurse or doctor.

‘I have to say that in the end I hung up in sheer frustration ten or 15 minutes into the call because I could tell that I was not getting anywhere quickly.’

Yesterday NHS England released figures which it claimed showed the system was ‘steadily improving’ with 92 per cent of patients being ‘satisfied’ with the call centre staff.

But there were huge gaps in the data with crucial statistics apparently ‘not available’ for certain areas of the country where the launch of the helpline has been disastrous.

And earlier this week a leaked official report revealed how calls were routinely answered by untrained staff, patients were put on hold and doctors’ warnings ignored.

Recently Miss McIntosh, who is married but uses her maiden name, upset some women GPs by referring to the high cost of training female doctors who may end up working just a few days a week.

She claimed those who only work part-time after having children are putting a ‘burden’ on the NHS.
