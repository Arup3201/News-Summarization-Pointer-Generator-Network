Children are returning to the type of books loved by their grandparents.

A new wave of writers inspired by traditional favourites like Enid Blyton has marked the resurgence of mystery and detective novels for children, according to a leading bookstore.

Six novels shortlisted for the Waterstones Children’s Book Prize involve super-sleuthing children who are left to their own devices to solve mysteries, reminiscent of old favourites like the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys series or Enid Blyton’s Famous Five.

Children are now reading the sort of books their grandparents did, according to the shortlist for the Waterstones Children’s Book Prize

Half the novels shortlisted in the categories ‘Best Books for Teens’ and ‘Best Fiction for 5-12s’ are mysteries.

In recent years vampire novels and dystopian stories have dominated teenage reading lists and light-hearted ‘funny fiction’ has prevailed for younger readers. 

Now new trends suggest there is a demand for wholesome novels which are familiar to parents from their own childhoods.

Books shortlisted for the prize include ‘Murder Most Unladylike’ by Robin Stevens, which stars a pair of boarding school teens investigating the murder of their teacher, and ‘Smart’ by Kim Slater which follows a misfit teen investigating the death of a homeless man.

Melissa Cox, head of children’s buying at Waterstones, said: ‘Crime fiction is a perennial favourite on adults’ bookshelves, but the resurgence of children’s mystery books recently is striking.

‘Enid Blyton is a classic example of a children’s mystery author and her storytelling has clearly been an influence on a couple of the authors we have shortlisted.

‘The trend harks back to more traditional storytelling compared to some of the other stuff we have seen lately like funny fiction for younger readers or dystopian and vampire fiction for teens.

‘The sorts of books that are easy to sell are one that parents deem, not necessarily a ‘safe’ read, but as something they would have read in their own childhood.

‘By borrowing from the detective genre, many of our shortlisted authors have allowed their characters to deal with some very serious issues within a framework that also feels safe and familiar for young readers. 

'Some books, however, have simply channelled the good old-fashioned fun of catching the baddie.’

Another current children’s bestseller, Girl Online, the fictional novel by YouTube star Zoella (real name Zoe Sugg) is also linked to a desire for ‘innocent’ books for tweens and teens.

Ms Cox added: ‘Zoella’s book is very squeaky-clean. There is nothing in there that is going to alarm parents.’

Natalie Doherty, from Penguin Random House, is the editor of Murder Most Unladylike, which has been shortlisted in the Best Fiction for 5-12 category. 

She said the novel, set in a boarding school, is a fresh, modern take on two classic children’s genres.

She said: ‘It takes the traditional murder mystery story in the style of Agatha Christie and combines it with the Enid Blyton-style boarding school stories like Mallory Towers. 

'It has a nostalgic appeal to people who grew up reading those types of novels.

‘Despite that, it doesn’t feel like an old-fashioned story. It is really fresh and modern and looks at themes like racism, same-sex relationships and bullying. 

'It’s also very funny, with lots of dry humour.’

The winner of the Waterstones Children’s Book Prize will be announced on March 26. Six books will compete in each category: Best Illustrated Book, Best Fiction for 5-12s and Best Books for Teens.

The winning author from each category will receive £2,000 with the overall winner receiving an extra £3,000.

Mystery novels nominated for Best Fiction for 5-12s include Murder Most Unladylike by Robin Stevens, Violet and the Pearl of the Orient by Harriet Whitehorn and A Boy Called Hope by Lara Williamson.

In the Best Books for Teens category, the mystery novels shortlisted include The Apple Tart of Hope by Sarah Moore Fitzgerald, Dead Ends by Erin Lange and Smart by Kim Slater.
