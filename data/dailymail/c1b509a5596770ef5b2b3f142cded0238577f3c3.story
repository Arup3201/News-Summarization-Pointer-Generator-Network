Through the telescopic sights of their sniper rifles the marksmen of Algeria’s Special Forces watched as exhausted, frightened foreign hostages were pushed through the wooden doorway of the block where they had been sheltering towards a fleet of jeeps.

Some would have had a clear shot at the Jihadist kidnappers from the ‘Blood Battalion’ but no order was given to open fire when the convoy started moving.

Instead, heavily armed gunships opened fire on the speeding vehicles - hitting and destroying four and causing a fifth to spin over and to crash.

Two of the vehicles exploded and 
another burst into a ‘ball of flames.’  It was a scene of carnage with 
bullets flying, explosions, fires, smoke billowing into the clear bright
blue sky.

'There were bodies everywhere,’ one witness said, ‘the Algerian forces were firing at anything that moved.’

One was blown several feet into the air. Few, if anyone, could have survived, witnesses said.

Deadly: It was unclear whether the cars were struck by missiles fired from helicopters or by ground forces, but the air attack was deadly

The horrific details of the immediate
aftermath of Thursday’s assault on the gas plant emerged yesterday from
Algerian hostages and the family of Stephen McFaul, of West Belfast, 
who was in the vehicle that crashed and had explosives tied around his 
neck.

Exactly why the Algerians opened fired on 4x4 wheel vehicles packed with hostages and terrorists remains a mystery.

The Algerians said the kidnappers 
were ‘making a run’ for it but with the barren Sahara desert stretching 
for hundreds of miles around the sprawling BP gas plant, there was 
nowhere to go.

Amazingly, Mr McFaul a 36-year-old father-of-two, was able to sprint to safety at the height.

The electrical engineer told his 
family he had narrowly escaped death twice - first when bound and gagged
by the gunmen who fastened explosives around the hostages’ necks and 
then in the convoy of five vehicles driving across the complex.

Questions: The attack suggests either a lapse in stringent security at the base, or an emboldening of Islamist insurgents

‘(The gunmen) were moving five jeeploads of hostages from one part of the compound,’ his brother Brian McFaul said.

‘At that stage, they were intercepted by the Algerian army.

‘The army bombed four out of five of 
the trucks and four of them were destroyed ... He presumed everyone else
in the other trucks was killed ... The truck my brother was in crashed 
and at that stage Stephen was able to make a break for his freedom.’

Hostages were used as human shields 
as, in the space of minutes, the hostage crisis had gone from one of 
containment and negotiation to a bloodbath and running battles.

Dozens of desperate foreign and 
Algerian workers had found hiding places when the kidnappers had stormed
the complex in what appeared a well planned operation - their ease of 
movement and familiarity with the vast complex suggestion an ‘inside 
knowledge.’

At least three Britons found a 
sanctuary in the ceiling of the canteen area only emerging yesterday 
when they were sure Algerian forces had regained control of the area.

One French hostage, Alexandre 
Berceaux, who works for the CIS catering company, said he hid in a room 
away from other foreign hostages, arranging planks of wood to conceal 
his presence.

‘I stayed hidden for nearly 40 hours in my bedroom, under the bed,’ he said.

‘When the military came to get me, I 
did not know whether it was over,’ he added. ‘They arrived with 
colleagues (Algerians who worked with him), otherwise I would never have
opened the door.’

Bloodbath: Helicopters began strafing the plant in In Amenas (above) this morning, hours after the rebels had threatened to blow up the hostages if they intervened

Berceaux said Algerian soldiers found 
some British hostages hiding on the roof and were still combing the 
sprawling gas site for others when he was escorted to a nearby military 
base.

‘They are still counting them up,’ he said.

Many had been in hiding at the 
supposedly secure and well energy facility, which produces some 10 per 
cent of the natural gas on which Algeria depends for its export income, 
since the militants moved-in on Wednesday morning.

More than 600 Algerians work on the complex and it became clear quickly they were not the targets.

An Algerian engineer, Khaled, said : 
‘I heard gunfire, sustained shooting. Then the guy who was clearly the 
head of the armed group spoke to us. He said he was called Abu al-Baraa 
and he said he would let us go quickly. It was the foreigners who 
interested them, they only wanted them.

'The Islamists left us our phones so 
we could call our families. But quite quickly it became impossible to 
contact anyone. Someone told me they had freed the women, but I didn’t 
see that.

‘The women who work on the site are 
mostly interpreters. Later in the morning there was an assault. I was in
the games room at the time. There was a lot of pushing and shoving, 
some people managed to open the security door, and we all just ran for 
it.’

Another Algerian added : ‘It was clear they would not harm Muslims, they wanted Christians and infidels.’

Brahim, an Algerian technician employed by BP, said the Algerian workers were held separately from the foreigners.

During Wednesday night, Brahim said, 
he and his colleagues helped threee foreign members of staff escape 
through a wire fence into the safer Algerian side of the compound.

‘We hid them and reassured them. The 
first skirmishes between the Algerian army and the terrorists came at 
about 1pm on the Thursday.

‘Despite our fear, from the beginning 
of the shooting we decided to try our luck. We cut the wire fence with 
clippers, and ran for it, all together, 50 or so of us with the three 
foreigners.

‘We were welcomed by the special 
forces who were only a few dozen metres from the base. I didn’t look 
back. The only thing I saw was a plane overflying the site. The army 
frisked us and questioned us, then we were handed over to the gendarmes 
who took us to In Amenas airport.’

Around 40 international hostages were 
taken and the Jihadists are said to have appeared confident and ‘not 
afraid to die’ as they made their initial demand that French military 
action stop in Mali and Algeria stop allowing warplanes to use its 
airspace to bomb Al Qaeda-linked rebels.

Clearly, they expected expected to 
negotiate, Abu al-Baraa, the chief hostage taker, taking to the Al 
Jazeera news channel to tell them : ‘We demand the Algerian army pull 
out from the area to allow negotiations.’

Al-Baraa, who is now thought to have 
been killed, also used his mobile phone to speak to military commanders 
gathering in the area, saying he would ‘spare’ all those held in return 
for a series of demands.

These ranged from Islamist prisoners 
being released, to the terrorist gang being allowed a safe passage to 
neighbouring Mali, and an end to French military action.

The Algerians said yesterday the 
Islamists were a mixture of nationalities - the 18 militants so far 
found dead have included three Egyptians, two Tunisians, two Libyans, a 
Malian and a Frenchman - and in claims certain to interest both MI5 and 
MI6, one of the senior kidnappers is said to have spoken English with a 
‘perfect accent’ raising the possibility of at least one of the 
terrorists being linked to the UK.
