Wales boss Chris Coleman has leapt to the defence of Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey.

The 31-cap playmaker made his first start for Arsene Wenger's men after injury on Tuesday night and played for 90 minutes as they threw away a three-goal lead to draw with Anderlecht in the Champions League.

Former Gunners striker Charlie Nicholas picked out Ramsey for particular criticism in his post-match analysis, which included the belief that the 23-year-old is going backwards after a sensational last campaign which included an FA Cup final winner.

When asked if he felt the comments were unfair during the announcement of his squad to face Belgium next Sunday, Coleman said: 'Yes. Charlie Nicholas is paid to give his opinion as a pundit but it is not as black and white as that. It can't be.

'Charlie was a player himself. No player plays well in every game and every month and Charlie should know that. They have good spells and bad spells.

'If Aaron is not at his best at the minute then the next game or the week or two weeks after he will be at his best.

'Aaron has played a lot of games for us where he has dictated the tempo of the game at both ends of the pitch. If you can do that you have got to be a good player.

'For me I am just glad he is playing. And I know Aaron, he needs to keep playing and playing regularly, that is when we see the best of him.'

Ramsey is one of eight players heading to Brussels having recovered from injury, a list that also includes defenders James Collins, Paul Dummett and Adam Matthews.

But it is in midfield where Coleman's squad has received the biggest boost with Wigan midfielder Emyr Huws and playmaker Jonny Williams, who limped off after a star display against Bosnia-Herzegovina, returning to the fold along with Ramsey and Joe Allen.

'We've rarely had Allen and Ramsey together,' Coleman said.

'It is nice to have Ramsey back and Joe had a good game against Real Madrid and did very well. Two players of that calibre are going to improve any squad, we know that, so it is very good to have them back.

'I thought Liverpool played fantastically and Joe was at the heart of it so that was pleasing to see.'

Also on board is Fulham boss Kit Symons, despite Coleman's reservations that the Wales assistant manager may forgo his international commitments to focus on the Cottagers having been handed the reigns at Craven Cottage.

'Kit is on the trip,' Coleman said. 'I had a conversation with him about whether he'd be carrying on and I thought maybe he wouldn't and I didn't want to lose him.

'He doesn't want to not be here, he wants to carry on. He spoke with the Fulham chairman (Shahid Khan), who has been very supportive, so it is very positive.'

The one area where Coleman's 25-man group looks particular light is up front.

They may have the world's most expensive player of all time in Gareth Bale, but he is joined by four forwards with just 28 caps between them due to injuries to Simon Church, who started all three previous Euro 2016 qualifiers, and Burnley's Sam Vokes.

Coleman said: 'It is a shame for Churchy. We knew we were going to miss big Sam with his injury.

'We have the man Baley and then we've got some youth there in Tom Lawrence and George Williams, who are very exciting.'
