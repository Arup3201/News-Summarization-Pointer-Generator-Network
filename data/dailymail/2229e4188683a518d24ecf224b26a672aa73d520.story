The oldest woman to complete the New York City Marathon on Sunday - at age 86 - died just one day later, her family has revealed.

But while Joy Johnson's relatives are mourning her passing, they agree it was an appropriate end for the grandmother, who once declared in an interview: 'I want to die running. That's my goal.'

Johnson, from San Jose, California, was taking part in the race for the 25th time when she stumbled and hit her head on the road near mile 20. Medical staff wanted to take her to hospital, but she insisted on continuing.

She completed the race and the next morning, she joined the Today show crowd at the Rockefeller Center with her sister, Faith Anderson, in what has become a post-marathon tradition for the pair.

During a brief appearance on the show, host Al Roker inquired about the bandage over her eye and she dismissed it, saying: 'It looks much worse than it really is.'

But after returning to her hotel room 
later that morning, she said she was tired and took a nap - but she never 
woke up, Anderson told the New York Daily News.

Johnson was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where she was declared dead.

'At least she was running, the way she wanted to go,' her daughter, Diana Boydston, told the Daily News.

It was Johnson's 25th time completing 
the marathon, and her involvement this year made her the oldest woman 
running the New York City Marathon since 2011.

Appearance: Just hours before her death, Mrs 
Johnson appeared on the Today show with Al Roker. She was wearing a 
bandage on her face after her fall but insisted that 'it looked much worse than it is'

Loss: After the Today show appearance she went for a rest at her hotel room and never woke up

The race was just the latest feat for the octogenarian, who started running aged 59. She had worked as a gym teacher and when she saw another teacher run by her house, she decided to join her.

After that, she was hooked.

Three years later, she and a former 
teaching colleague were running 12 miles a day and planning their first 
marathon. She completed it three months later, aged 61, in four hours, 
22 minutes.

After that, she 
went on to complete in about 11 races a year, including three marathons 
and a selection of 12km runs and half marathons.

On Sunday, she completed the marathon in 
eight hours, which was far longer than at her peak in 1991, when she 
finished in 3 hours, 55 minutes and 30 seconds.

Aware that her times were slipping as she entered her 80s, she explained to the Wall Street Journal in 2008 that she was stepping up her exercise regimen.

While the cause of Mrs Johnson's death has not been released, she passed away a day after she hit her head on the road, raising the possibility that she suffered a concussion.

A concussion is a brain injury which is sustained by a blow to the head or when the upper body is violently shaken. It can cause a headache, loss of consciousness or mental function, dizziness, nausea or fatigue. A blow to the head may even lead to bleeding in or around your brain and such bleeding can be fatal.

Therefore medical staff suggest that anyone who suffers a head injury should see a doctor as soon as possible.

In addition, you should not return to physical activity while symptoms of a concussion are present until you are medically evaluated.

She described a brutal workout of leaving the house at 5am, running up bleachers at a local school and completing as many as 55 miles a week, but also conceded that she knew she would be walking for some parts of future marathons.

In an interview a day before this year's race, she lamented that she was slowing down, but said she had remained focused - regularly going on eight-mile runs and completing 150 push ups.

She said she felt in good health but that she was planning to run at her own pace and complete it.

'I'll be at the back of the pack, but I don't mind,' she said. 'I just praise the Lord I can get out of bed each morning and run. A lot of people my age are in wheelchairs.'

She proudly posed for photographs with fans who knew her through the running community.

'I always say I'm going to run 
until I drop,' she said, the New York Daily News reported. 'I'm going to die in my tennis shoes. I just 
don't know when I'm going to quit.'

She was preceded in death by her husband, Newell, who passed away 15 years ago.

This year, 31 of the 50,000 people who took part in the marathon were over the age of 80.
