'All these men kept calling and ...I tell you what I was livid,' Margaret told the radio station.

'It was such a shock because he couldn't understand it and I couldn't understand it.'

She told the radio station the nine-year-old received scores of calls from would be customers.

Margaret contacted 6PR after an anonymous caller dialled the station to say someone in Queensland had accidentally received the same number as Naitanui.

6PR breakfast announcer Basil Zempilas dialled Naitanui to verify the claim.

When they contacted the 24-year-old, he reportedly told them he was baffled by the occurrence and had decided to buy a new phone.

''He said he had no idea how it happened and nobody could explain how it happened,' Zempilas said.

Fairfax reported that a failure within the provisioning system of the telco company would be responsible for the improbable mix-up.
