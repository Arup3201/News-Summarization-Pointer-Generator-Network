Now this is what you call brotherly love.

These two young fox cubs were caught play-fighting on camera, before one affectionately put his arm round the other.

The playful cubs were photographed pawing and biting at each other. Once worn out however, the pair settled down and snuggled up to each other.

The playful cubs were seen pawing and biting at each other as they played in northern Virginia

After the cubs had stopped playing, one of them put his arm affectionately round the other

Amateur photographer Patrick Martin, 55, captured the lively young animals on camera as they played in northern Virginia in May this year.

Mr Martin, of Alexandria, said: 'They were acting like puppies, jumping all over one another, picking up sticks and playing for hours.

'They were very affectionate with each other, and kept trying to grab each others' tails and pulling their ears.'

Wildlife expert John Bryant, co-author of the book Unearthing The Urban Fox, said the cubs' time spent playing was a way to develop skills needed for later on in life.

Once worn out through playfighting, the pair settled down and snuggled up to each other

He said: 'Play is always a preparation for things that you're going to need in later life.

'Foxes like jumping and sneaking up on each other because this is good practice for when they are out hunting as adults.

'They can be very affectionate with each other. Fox cubs will spend all day jumping and play-fighting with one another, then at night they will cuddle up and go to sleep.'
