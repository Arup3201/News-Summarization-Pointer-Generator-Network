Passport controls could be required at Scotland's border with England if it becomes independent in order to comply with EU law, Britain's Minister for Europe has warned.

A separate Scotland would need to negotiate its own opt-out from the Schengen Agreement, which allows for free travel between 25 EU states, according to David Lidington.

The agreement could pose 'a clear problem' should Scotland gain independence from England, he said.

'Clear problem': David Lidington, Britain's Minister for Europe, said the Schengen Agreement would create a challenge for Scotland's border control if they gain independence

Britain's decision to opt out of the Schengen Agreement means that other EU citizens are still subject to passport checks on our borders because is outside the European free travel area.

However, if Scotland gains independence it will - as an EU member state - automatically be part of the Agreement and will have to negotiate its own withdrawal which must be approved by every other member state, it was reported.

If it doesn't, passport controls would need to be set up at the border because Schengen bans free European travel between those who are part of the Agreement, and those who are not.

Mr Lindington said - during a visit to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh - that there were no guarantees Scotland could choose to withdraw from the agreement.

Opt-out: Britain's withdrawal from the Agreement means it maintains a tighter control of its borders

He said opt-outs from the 
single currency and free travel area 'require not just a bilateral 
agreement between the UK and an independent Scotland, it would require 
the agreement of all of the other member states as well'.

He
 told the Telegraph: 'The fact the UK has an opt-out from Schengen means that we are 
able to maintain the border controls that you don't often have on the 
borders between Schengen countries.'

Previously, the European Commission's president, Jose Manuel Barroso, warned that no more countries would be able to opt-out of the single currency.

A spokesman for Alex Salmond - the Scottish National Party leader - said that the 'scaremongering' stories were demonstrably untrue, adding: 'They are insulting to Scotland, and the only effect they are having is to boost support for independence.'
