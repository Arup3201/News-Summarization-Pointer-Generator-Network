Simon Large was described by his family as a loving, gentle, caring person who was good to be around

A 22-year-old man who deliberately accelerated to knock a 24-year-old man over, was today jailed for life at Reading Crown Court.

Ricky Clarke-Dilly picked-up speed as he drove towards Simon Large, 24, who was part of a rival group.

He went from 24mph to 52mph in less than three seconds, in a 20mph zone. He drove off after he struck his victim.Mr Large was crossing the road with friends who had had an altercation with Clarke-Dilly earlier in the evening.

A jury was told that Clarke-Dilly was accused of fighting Mr Large's friend, Matthew Turner, and ripping his shirt, in Club One in Ascot.

Clarke-Dilly was forced to reimburse Mr Turner, and gave him Â£90. After several scuffles, the rival groups left the club.

When Mr Large, Mr Turner and their friends crossed a road, Clarke-Dilly drove at twice the speed limit into their path.

Clarke-Dilly, from Slough, Berkshire, was told that he would serve a minimum of 15 years for the murder of "gentle and caring" Simon Large.

Mr Large was treated at St George's Hospital, Tooting, London for broken bones and damaged organs. He was placed in a coma but died from his injuries a week later.

On sentencing him Judge Zoe Smith 
described his action as 'indiscriminate violence' and said that since then he 'lacked remorse or a conscience.'

She
said: 'You had been 
forced into a position whereby you had to give money to Matthew Turner 
as his shirt had been ripped by one of your friends. Clearly this made 
you angry.

Mr Large, 24, was crossing the road with his friends when the revenge attack happened. His friends got out of the way of the accelerating vehicle

The men had been partying at Ascot's Club 1 when a row over a ripped shirt broke out. Mr Large's friend demanded Clarke-Dilly paid to replace his shirt

'As you were driving up the road you saw Matthew Turner and his group crossing the road.

'What happened then is captured on CCTV and has been played here and what has been observed can only be described as horrific.

'You accelerated as hard as you could towards them going from 24mph to 52mph in just 2.97 seconds.'

Judge Smith said that Mr Large was 'in the prime of his life with a bright future ahead of him.'

'They (his family) have described Simon as a loving, gentle, caring person who was good to be around.

'Their lives and those of his extended family and many friends have been devastated.'

Clarke-Dilly had previously admitted manslaughter but denied the more serious charge of murder.

The judge gave Clarke-Dilly a life sentence because his 'intention was to cause really serious harm rather than to kill but due to the impact speed it was almost inevitable it would be fatal.'

A jury took nine hours to convict him of murder. Judge Smith added: "I accept that you came across the group unexpectedly and you were not looking for them.

'Your
intention was to cause really serious harm rather than to kill but due 
to the impact speed it was almost inevitable it would be fatal.'

After the hit and run, Clarke-Dilly crashed the car into a bollard before being arrested by police, explaining his dishevelled appearance as having been "kicked out" by his girlfriend.

Clarke-Dilly gave police a prepared statement which said that although he was driving, his front seat passenger had taken the steering wheel prior to the impact.
