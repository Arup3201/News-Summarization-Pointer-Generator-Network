An Italian derby match was called off yesterday after players for visiting side Nocerina, claimed they had received death threats and faked injuries to get off the pitch.

After just 21 minutes the third division side were reduced to six men causing the match to be abandoned.

The southern derby match at Salernitana had begun 40 minutes late as officials tried to persuade Nocerina to start the game.

Injured player of Nocerina, Petar Kostadinovic, during the match, his team was down to 6 players after just 21 minutes

They eventually did so, but made their three permitted substitutions in the first two minutes.

Over the next 20 minutes, five players went off injured, leaving the team with six players, below the minimum needed to continue the game.

Nocerina fans had been banned from the 
match to avoid potential crowd trouble. Italian media said that, 
incensed by the ban, the supporters demanded that the team refuse to 
play and reportedly made death threats.

Video pictures showed that Nocerina's 
team bus had been surrounded by dozens of their own fans as it left 
their hotel for the stadium to play arch-rivals Salernitana in Lega Pro 
group B.

A video on the website of local 
newspaper Citta di Salerno showed dozens of fans, many of them hooded, 
outside the team hotel. They surrounded the team bus, gesticulated 
angrily as it drove away and let off fireworks.

On hearing that the match had been abandoned, the fans were reported to have celebrated in a public square.

After the game, the entire Nocerina board of directors resigned and the players imposed a media silence.

Substitution: Local media reported that the team from Nocera Inferiore, 40 kilometres south of Naples, subbed three players in the early minutes and had five limp off the pitch by the 21st, leaving six on the pitch to force the suspension of the game

Banned: The regional derby of the Lega Pro, the third level of the Italian football professional leagues, has been marred in the past by clashes between rival fans leading to a crack down by authorities

Sporting 
director Luigi Pavarese told the media: 'I'm
just here to announce that all the directors of Nocerina have resigned 
and that the players will not be speaking to the media.'

Asked about the injuries, he 
replied: 'The lads went onto the pitch without warming up, which caused 
the injuries.'

'The key point 
of this story was terror, fear of the consequences and the threats in 
this demeaning episode,' added Italian Football Federation president 
Giancarlo Abete.

The regional derby of the Lega Pro, the third level of the Italian football professional leagues, has been marred in the past by clashes between rival fans leading to authorities clamping down on fans.

During the game, a light aircraft flew over the stadium carrying a banner saying 'Respect for Nocera and the ultras - their die-hard fans.

Anger: During the game, a light aircraft flew over the stadium carrying a banner demanding respect for the visiting side

The incident was the latest blow to the 
lower tiers of Italian football which are still reeling from the 
Calcioscommesse match-fixing scandal.

Around 50 players were banned and more than one dozen clubs had points deducted over the manipulation of lower league matches during the 2010/11 season.

In an interview with RAI television Lega Pro director general Francesca Ghirelli said: 'This has caused enormous damage, it's an extremely grave matter.

We have to reflect on how to prevent these indecent spectacles. It's a disgrace.

'We will wait for the sporting tribunal to judge this episode which has done huge damage to the Lega Pro.'
