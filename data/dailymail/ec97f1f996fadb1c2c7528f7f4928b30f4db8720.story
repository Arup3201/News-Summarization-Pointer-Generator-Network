Anthony Joshua walked out to the haunting words of Mike Tyson before delivering a performance worthy of the former undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.

The 24-year-old may not exhibit the personality of the self-proclaimed Baddest Man on the Planet but the Olympic champion showed no mercy to veteran Matt Skelton on Saturday night.

He needed less than six minutes to deliver what is fast becoming his trademark knockout in front of a boisterous Liverpool crowd.

At 47, Skelton's best days are a distant memory but the former British and Commonwealth champion's spoiling tactics presented a new challenge for Joshua.

But after a rough and tumble first round, the Londoner began to find the target with ominous ease, dropping Skelton with a right hand.

Although he rose, the fight was waved off seconds later as Skelton tottered backwards.

Joshua, who has now won his first seven fights as a professional, told Sky Sports: 'I was looking forward to getting in there and mixing it up. Now that's out of the way it's back to the gym.

'I wish I had him when he was at European level but it's a good name on my record.

'I stuck to my jab, each fight I'm learning and if I keep progressing I'll keep getting these knockouts.'

Joshua will fight again in Dublin on August 30 against Yaroslav Zavorotnyi, a Ukrainian who took David Price 10 rounds last month.
