Film rental chain Blockbuster is to shut 72 British stores - axing 452 jobs.

The closures will mean the loss of about a quarter of its 264 outlets and 2,000-strong workforce.

Earlier this week the chain, which has been hit hard by competition from supermarkets, the internet and delivery services like LoveFilm, went into administration for the second time this year.

It was understood that employees were being told of the job losses this morning.

The firm is holding talks with potential buyers for the remaining shops and a further update is due within the next week.

In a statement, the administrators Moorfields Corporate
Recovery said: 'Over the past few days our focus has been to assess the financial situation of Blockbuster in order to try and find a buyer for the business.

'As part of this process, we are today regretfully announcing the closure of 72 stores across the United Kingdom and the loss of 452 jobs.

'This has not been an easy decision to make and we acknowledge that, with Christmas on the horizon, this will be extremely upsetting news to a large number of people, most of all those affected by the store closures.

'We must reiterate that, as part of our attempts to turn around the business, today's decision is necessary if parts of Blockbuster are to be saved and a buyer found.

'Discussions with potential buyers for parts of the business continue and we hope to be in a position to update staff, creditors and customers shortly with a further statement within the next seven days.'

Launched in 1985 in Dallas, Texas, Blockbuster set up its UK arm in 1989 when it bought Europe's largest rental firm Ritz Video for $135 million.

By the time it reached its peak in 2004, it had more than 9,000 stores and 60,000 employees globally.

But the firm struggled against the rise of internet streaming and home delivery services like LoveFilm and Netflix.

Blockbuster's UK arm collapsed in January - at which point it had 528 UK stores and 4,190 staff - and was mostly rescued by the private equity group Gordon Brothers Europe.

Trading has not picked up enough since then for it to survive, the statement said.

While the administrators say parts of the business have attracted interest, many buyers only want empty shops which they can turn into something else.

Supermarket firm Morrisons bought 49 former outlets earlier this year as part of its convenience store expansion.

The axe also fell on all 300 company-owned Blockbuster stores in the U.S. last week, leaving the once-dominant chain with just 50 franchised shops.

In a grim coincidence, footwear retailer Barratts also went into administration on Monday - for the third time in five years - putting 1,035 jobs at risk.
