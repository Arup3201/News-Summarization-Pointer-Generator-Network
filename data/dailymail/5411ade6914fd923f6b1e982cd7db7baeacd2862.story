The gourmet food company Neal's Yard Creamery has recalled batches of unpasteurised goat's milk cheese because of contamination with Listeria.

Listeria poisoning is a particular threat to mothers-to-be and has been associated with a higher risk of miscarriage.

The cheese was sold through two shops in London, one in Covent Garden and the second in Borough Market, on the south bank of the Thames.

Details were released by the Food Standards Agency, which said: 'Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that can cause food poisoning, particularly among key vulnerable groups, including pregnant women, unborn and newborn babies, those over 60 years old, and anyone with reduced immunity.'

The product involved is 200g packs of the company's Ragstone unpasteurised goat' s milk cheese, which is made in Herefordshire and sells for £9.80.

The FSA said: 'Neal's Yard recalled the affected batch from customers as a precaution last week. Most of the product that was sold has been returned. Point of sale notices will be displayed in the stores concerned.

'If you have bought the above product, do not eat it. Instead, return it to the store from where it was bought.'
