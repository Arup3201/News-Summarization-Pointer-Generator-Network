A street in Blackburn has been turned into a fictional sectarian battleground in Belfast during the height of the Northern Ireland troubles.

Smoke, armoured cars, a burnt-out bus and rubble filled the streets as 10 days of filming got under way  for the new movie.

Other explosive scenes include a man jumping from an upstairs terraced house and a bus explode into a fireball during gritty rioting scenes.

The Troubles: Actors film a scene in this back street in Blackburn which became the backdrop to a new film set in Belfast about Northern Ireland in 1971

Six terraced streets in the town were sealed off to become home to some of British cinema and TV's rising stars as a 65-strong crew films the story of a young Northern British soldier's nightmare journey after separation from his colleagues.

The thriller '71' stars 22-year-old actor Jack O'Connell, who played Pukey Nicholls in 'This Is England', Marky in 'Harry Brown', and James Cook in the E4 teen drama Skins.

In the film he takes the part of a young British squaddie accidentally abandoned by his unit following a riot on the streets of Belfast in 1971.

Unable to tell friend from foe, and wary of his comrades, the raw recruit must survive the night alone and find his way to safety through a disorientating, alien and deadly landscape.

The Blackburn streets feature as the daytime start of his horror.

Director Angus Lamont said: 'We chose Blackburn because it has the type of Victorian terraced mill-town streets typical of parts of Belfast before the damage and redevelopment caused by the Troubles. The council were very helpful with us.'

But local resident Deborah Sengel, 45, who lives just yards from the location said: 'They never said a thing to me about what they were going to be doing and it's really close to my house.

'It's been horrible and my house stinks of smoke. I have even been getting headaches and I put it down to all the fumes coming from when they are burning the bus.

'My cars are filthy and I've even had to put one in the garage.

'They have said that they will pay for our windows to be cleaned but I think they should pay for the cars too. They have offered people on the street money but they told me that they had run out of their budget but will look into it. The film is allegedly costing £7million.

Burnt out: Not everyone has been happy about the filming with some residents complaining about noise and smoke

Director Angus Lamont said he chose to film the drama in Blackburn because of its Victorian terraced streets which is typical to some parts of Belfast

"I can honestly say I feel very disturbed by what I have seen. I have had all the cast sat outside my house and all the army trucks parked up outside. The noise has been terrible and it's been going on until 9.30pm. I honestly never thought I'd be so distressed.'

Shopkeeper Irfan Sanje, 46, said: 'It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness this and I think it will plug the town and give it more recognition.

'I'm loving watching it because I take a real interest in films. It's amazing their attention to detail and the effects that are going on.

'The only disappointing thing is that you can't get too close when they are filming. You watch a film and you don't realise all the work that goes into it and what is behind the scenes. This gives us a glimpse of what it is like and how much work is done for a matter of minutes.

'I've seen them re-shoot the same scene over and over again.

'You hear about the troubles and what happened in Belfast to some extent but this really opens the mind up to what it was like back then.'

Michelle Lovatt, 42, who works in the street's tanning salon, Mambo's, which is being featured in the film under the new name, Donard's Cafe, said: 'They obviously didn't have sunbed shops in 1971 so we've been made to look like a cafe and they've boarded up all the windows so it is part of the set.

Filming took place over 10 days in Blackburn which saw a row a terraced houses transformed into Belfast in the 1970s

'We are having to get the customers come in through the back door when they are filming. I think people think we are closed because we have the burned out bus right outside they think there has been some sort of incident or a bus has crashed. It was good to watch it go up in flames.

'I've been watching them every day and it's been really good. We've had a lot of people coming to have a look and see what's going on too, normally it's a pretty quiet street.

'I think it will be good for the area because its different and we're not used to stuff like this. We've seen them shooting the different scenes and we've had chance to see the rioting and get a feel for what it was like back then with the IRA.

'We've watched the riots between the people and the police and witnessed them throwing water bombs.

'It's a really good location for them to shoot and it's good that the terraced rows are still here but they are getting pulled down after the filming.

'They have been noisy but it's been fun to watch. The actors have been good but there has been some bad language but that is when they are in character. I'm looking forward to seeing it when it has finished.' 

In 1963, the prime minister of Northern Ireland, Viscount Brookeborough, stepped down after 20 years in office. 

His long tenure was a produce of the Ulster Unionist domination of politics in the north since partition in 1921. 

By contrast the Catholic minority had been politically marginalised. This was largely a product of Northern Ireland's two-thirds Protestant majority but was exacerbated by the drawing of local government electoral boundaries to favour unionist candidates.

Additionally, the right to vote in local government elections was restricted to ratepayers - again favouring Protestants.

This bias was preserved by unequal allocation of council houses to Protestant families. Catholic areas also received less government investment than their Protestant neighbours. Police harassment, exclusion from public service appointments and other forms of discrimination were factors of daily life, and the refusal of Catholic political representatives in parliament to recognise partition only increased the community's sense of alienation.

But there had been improvements. Post-war Britain's new Labour government had introduced the Welfare State to the north, and it was implemented with few, if any, concessions to old sectarian divisions. In a series of radical moves, he met with the Republic of Ireland's prime minister Sean Lemass - the first such meeting between Irish heads of government for 40 years.

This represented a serious threat to many unionists. O'Neill's policies provoked outspoken attacks from within unionism, not least from the Reverend Ian Paisley who rose to prominence at this time. With Catholic hopes raised on one side and unionist fears on the other, the situation quickly threatened to boil over.

As a result, Catholic children in the 1950s could reap the benefits of further and higher education for the first time.

Viscount Brookeborough was replaced by a former army officer Terence O'Neill who introduced a series of measures to improve the economy.

Violence finally erupted in 1966 following the twin 50th anniversaries of the Battle of the Somme and the Easter Rising.

Rioting and disorder was followed in May and June by the murders of two Catholics and a Protestant by a 'loyalist' terror group called the Ulster Volunteer Force.

O'Neill immediately banned the UVF, but it was too late. The cycle of sectarian bloodletting that would become known as 'the Troubles' had already claimed its first victims.
