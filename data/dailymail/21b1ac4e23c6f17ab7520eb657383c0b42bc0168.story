This week I have been invited into the world of women’s fashion and accessories.

It’s a place that most regular guys fear to tread, and most would rather undergo an afternoon of root canal dentistry than venture out on a Saturday shopping trip with their lady friend.

The reason for this is simple: women can never have enough clothes and accessories. Fact.

So when I was invited out to a new women’s boutique opening in Kensal Rise called Lark London I ventured along with some trepidation.

The shop owners Phoebe Pring and Lucy Olivier clearly understand the female inability to resist pretty scarves, stoles, shawls, lingerie, jewellery, accessories, tops or leggings.

The racks were laden with eye-catching items and clothing from new and up-and-coming designers and there were whoops of joy coming from the women thumbing through the merchandise on show. (I’m going to pop back for something for Mother’s Day this Sunday).

The fashion crowd came to the Lark launch en mass from the four corners of London. The Notting Hill set were represented by Miquita Oliver and Kyle De’Volle (Rita Ora’s stylist) wearing an uber chic Louis Vuitton jacket, Primrose Hill delegates Sadie Frost and Meg Matthews were in attendance and even a few Made In Chelsea types - Binky Felstead, Rosie Fortescue and Phoebe-Lettice Thompson had made a rare journey away from SW3 all the way to NW10.

They were a super-stylish bunch of women at Lark and I felt a little bit underdressed but I had a club PA in Leeds that night and I wasn’t going to turn up to Chilli White night-club dressed in a suit.

It’s not that they’re not a smart bunch up in Yorkshire who don’t appreciate a good bit of tailoring. It’s just that four hours in a car up the M1 doesn’t improve the cut and look of your threads. You tend to bowl out of your car looking like you’ve just come out of a tumble-dryer.

I was intending to stay just a short while in Leeds but I was distracted by an extremely gorgeous female waitress. If I was a cynical kind of guy, I would suspect that the club did this deliberately as a cunning ploy. It worked. All the best, Spencer.
