Nicola Starr died of a fatal overdose after she was forced to give up her dreams of becoming a mother

A devoted wife died of a fatal drug overdose after she was forced to give up her dreams of becoming a mother.

Nicola Starr, 37, had wanted children with sales manager husband Paul, 45, yet was unable to conceive naturally.

She underwent IVF treatment but it failed when she miscarried their child and she slipped into bouts of depression.

The brunette, described by family friends as 'the brightest star', survived several attempts to kill herself with overdoses of paracetamol tablets and on one occasion she jumped off a bridge.

She was found eventually dead on her sofa at home in Blackpool, Lancashire, by husband of 12 years Mr Starr.

Tests showed she had succumbed to the combined effects of drugs she had been taking for a back injury.

At a Blackpool inquest Mrs Starr’s sister Natalie Towers, 31, said the former care worker had a history of depression brought on by her inability to have children.

She was prescribed anti-depressants but began drinking heavily was given powerfully painkillers for her back pain.

Mrs Towers said: 'The depressions was brought on by an inability to conceive naturally, this coupled with other big changes, failed IVF and a miscarriage and then redundancy.

'When Nicola was was very sick she felt she was not keeping the medication down so she took more than prescribed. 

'She didn’t believe it would harm her because she had built up a tolerance to the drugs.'

She said Mrs Starr had been looking forward to going away with her family to celebrate her grandmother’s birthday and had even had her hair and nails done.

But she added: 'There were suicide attempts but months and weeks leading up to her death she was making positive steps and was attending one-to-one counselling. 

'We are sure she did not intentionally take her own life. She was looking forward to the future.

'All of Nicola’s previous suicide attempts were when she was intoxicated - she said she didn’t know or remember anything.'

Mr Starr said his wife began drinking following the fertility treatment being stopped in January 2008.He said: 'It was quite rapid after that, she turned to drink. 

'We both had long standing jobs which changed but the main reason for the depression and drinking was the infertility.

'She was getting help for the alcohol dependency, the problem was it was hard to get help and then she would make it quite easy for them to back off, she would miss appointments, wouldn’t answer the door. She wasn’t in the right frame of mind.'

He said his wife had openly spoke about suicidal thoughts which had been 'a shock to the family'. He added: 'She did express that intention.

'On previous occasions with overdoses she never knew what was in her mind but most of the time it was on occasions when she had had a drink.

'After the event she was only vague in recollection.'

In the weeks before her death she had muscle, ligament and nerve damage in her arm and pains in her pelvis as a result of her fall from the bridge in November 2011.

She had spent three months in hospital but was in so much pain she would sleep downstairs so not to disturb her husband.

Mr Starr said: 'She always insisted she was in intolerable pain. When she wasn’t feeling the pain she would try and do more which would cause more pain. 

'If the pain started to get less she would try to do more. It was like a vicious cycle she got into.

'Whatever pain treatment she took, the pain seemed to be unbearable. The amount of time she had been on these pain killers she built up a tolerance. It just seemed really large amounts of pain relief and insisted she was still in pain.'

Mrs Starr’s mother Janet Caldwell, 55, said: 'She would cry, say she was sick of taking medication.

'She just wanted to be normal. She didn’t want to be on all the medication, she just wanted to work.'

Toxicology reports showed that Mrs Starr had no alcohol present in her blood.

Blackpool coroner Alan Wilson said he did not believe Mrs Starr had taken her own life adding that she had displayed a 'positive outlook’ for her future.

Recording a narrative verdict he said: 'There was no note and no expression of intent. I have taken on board the family evidence in terms of her positive outlook.

'This was someone who clearly made significant attempts on her life, in the context of having a drink but this doesn’t seem to be the case here.'

The family are currently raising money for Infertility Network UK a national infertility charity, dedicated to the support of everyone affected by infertility.

A message from the family after her death read: 'Hope you are at peace now Nicky and free from pain. 'Will be always missed, remembered and never ever forgotten.'
