Britain's Got Talent lost more than two million viewers in its second week as fans complained the show seemed ‘scripted’ and ‘predictable’.

Now in its eighth series, the ITV programme got off to a strong start this month when its first episode attracted a record audience of 10.5million viewers.

The figure – which climbed to more than 11million when viewers of the ITV+1 service were counted – was the highest ever for an opening show and the biggest rating of any TV show this year.

The show, fronted by Simon Cowell, saw the record breaking viewing figures of the series opener quickly trail off over scripting rows

But on Saturday, the number of viewers dropped dramatically to just 8.3million. While it was still the most watched show of the evening, with 45 per cent of all TV viewers, the figure was a drop of 2.3million in just a week.

Some viewers said they were bored by the format despite producers’ efforts to make the show more exciting this year.

For the first time, judges Simon Cowell, David Walliams, Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon are each allowed to send one act directly to the semi-finals by pressing a special ‘golden buzzer’.

But it did not stop many fans from complaining the programme seemed less spontaneous than in past years.

Writing on Twitter, one viewer, Alec Morgan, said: ‘I have decided that BGT is a load of scripted rubbish.’

Another, Jamie Ide, said: ‘BGT is so scripted, Simon has gone round YouTube seen some acts and paid them to come on.’

Judge David Walliams was branded 'cruel' for using his 'golden buzzer' to send one contestant - which was mocked for his act - through to the next round

A third, writing under the name Chris, said: ‘This show could really do without the pretentious production flourishes and scripted interactions between participants. #BGT’

It emerged that Paddy Jones, left, from the first show had already won a similar show in Spain

Other viewers said they felt the show has become too cruel towards its less talented contestants. On Saturday, the judges roundly mocked singer Christian Spridon after he delivered a tuneless rendition of Tom Jones’ hit Sex Bomb.

But he was saved when Walliams pressed his golden buzzer, leading some to accuse him of being insincere and leading the contestant to believe he had a chance.

One viewer said: ‘Sometimes it feels slightly cruel, like the golden buzzer bit, they were just taking the p** out that poor bloke.’

Another added: ‘That is such a cruel golden buzzer. That guy proper believes his talent @davidwalliams’.

A third said: ‘BGT is cruel…humiliating people in front of millions.’

Britain’s Got Talent has been hit by a series of fakery rows in recent years as it has emerged many contestants are directly approached by producers and encouraged to enter.

Far from being plucked from obscurity, some already have dedicated talent agents and successful careers.

And it emerged salsa-dancing grandmother Paddy Jones – who was the revelation of the first episode – had already won a similar Spanish talent contest called Tu Si Que Vales in 2009 before she was approached and asked to enter the British show.
