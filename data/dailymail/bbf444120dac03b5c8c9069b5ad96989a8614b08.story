Military health insurance officials are rethinking a decision to deny weight-loss surgery to a 12-year-old girl who is obese due to a rare medical condition.

TRICARE, which provides medical insurance to Alexis Shapiro's father Ian Shapiro, is reviewing her case after the family appealed the decision.

Alexis Shapiro suffers from hypothalmic obesity, which has caused her to pack on more than 140 pounds in two years.

Alexis Shapiro is obese but feels like she's starving and needs gastric bypass surgery in order to survive

With the U.S. military unwilling to pay for Alexis Shapiro's $50,000 operation, her family turned to crowd-funding and found success - to the tune of more than $78,000 so far.

The four-foot-seven-inch girl weighs 200 pounds and is gaining two pounds each week.

Her condition was triggered by surgery she had two years ago to remove a benign brain tumor.

During the operation, her hypothalmus and pituitary gland, which help govern appetite and weight, were damaged.

She now feels constantly hungry and her weight has caused other medical conditions.

In just the past three months, Alexis was hospitalized for a kidney infection and developed Type 2 diabetes that requires nightly insulin injections.

After the military rejected their initial request, the young girl's family was afraid the appeal process would take longer than she had.

'These kids will literally eat themselves to death,' mother Jenny Shapiro said. 'That’s what I’m scared of.'

The outpouring of love and funds on the 'Hope for Alexis' GoFundMe page gave hope to Alexis, whose condition has caused her to withdraw into her shell. She is now home-schooled and has no friends.

'You all have shown her that dreams can come true and that the rude comments out in public can be ignored because she has so many people supporting her and rooting for her,' her family posted on the page. 'Thank you oh so very much!'

Dr. Thomas H. Inge, of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, told NBC he plans to 'move forward as quickly as we can' with the life-saving operation.

Alexis is currently on a restricted diet of 900 to 1,400 calories per day but despite controlling her food intake, she keeps gaining weight.

Remarkable: The family's cries for help raised more than they ever could have hoped, far exceeding their goal of $50,000

'Our reviewers have denied your request for Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass,' reads the rejection notice sent from TRICARE earlier this month.

Her parents and doctors have asked that TRICARE reconsider their decision in order to save Alexis' life.

Her pediatric obesity doctor, Dr. Thomas H. Inge of Cincinnati, believes that surgery is the only way to keep the suffering girl from gaining more weight which could top 400 pounds.

Gastric bypass surgery will do more that destroy the weight, it can also tell her brain that she is not starving and she may be able to curb her painful appetite.

After her brain surgery, Alex's parents had to take extreme measures to keep their daughter from eating herself to death.

'She’s always hungry,' her father Ian Shapiro said. 'In the past, we’ve had to padlock the cupboard.'

This is Alexis before she had brain surgery that caused her to develop hypothalamic obesity after doing damage to her hypothalamus

More than half of children with the specific form of tumor Alexis had experience similar post-operative symptoms.

'I think it is disappointing that they cannot see the facts of this case,' said Inge, of the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.

'There is no evidence that doing nothing would be in this child’s best interests,' he continued.

According to a spokesperson for TRICARE said that gastric bypass and weight loss services are only covered of the patient is 18 or over and has full bone growth.

'In general, our Managed Care Support Contractors are required to approve or deny coverage based on TRICARE policy,' spokesman Austin Camacho said in an email to NBC News. 'We have an appeals process in place specifically designed to give our medical professionals the opportunity to examine the details of any special cases when coverage is denied,' said the insurance company.

Alexis may be a child, but she wears a women's size 1x or 2x and she goes up a size every month. When asked by psychologists about how she is coping with her condition, she has told them she 'wants to die.'

If Alexis gets the surgery she may be able to lead a normal life again and keep off the weight

'She doesn’t have any friends or anything like that,'  her mother Jenny Shapiro said. 'It’s so sad, because she remembers what it was like before.'

Doctor's believe that if Alexis has Bypass surgery, she may have a chance of leading a normal life.

TRICARE officials told NBC that the initial application for Alexis' weight loss surgery was denied because the paperwork didn't contain enough detail.

'The reason for this surgery request was simply "morbid obesity." There was no information indicating that this patient had a rare disease (panhypopituitarism),' said spokesman Austin Comacho. 'If the family had initiated the appeal process, as informed in the denial letter, all this would have come to light right away.'

Jenny Shapiro says that if TRICARE decides to pay for her daughter's surgery, the money donated will go towards Alexis' travel from Texas to Ohio for the surgery, medical therapy and medication. Anything left over will go towards helping other sick children.

'Alexis always wanted to help all the other kids every time we have been admitted,' her mother says.
