The Pakistani schoolgirl shot in the head by the Taliban and treated in Birmingham walked out of hospital today - three months after she was gunned down at point blank range for standing up for women's rights.

Looking frail but firm on her feet, Malala Yousafzai, 15, hugged and waved goodbye to staff at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital where she has undergone months of life-saving surgery to remove the  assassin's bullet from her brain.

She will continue her rehabilitation 
at the family's temporary home in the West Midlands before undergoing 
major reconstructive surgery in a few weeks.

Malala's bravery has moved the world in the months since she was targeted by the Taliban in Pakistan for heroically speaking out for women's rights and freedom of access to 
education in the country.

Triumph: Looking frail but firm on her feet, Malala Yousafzai, 15, waved goodbye to staff at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital as she left to rejoin her family

Hugs: In emotional scenes, Malala hugged staff that have cared for her over the past three months

In October last year a Taliban hitman burst onto her school bus in Swat, northern Pakistan, and shot her at point-blank range.

The bullet entered just above her left eye and ran along her jaw, 
'grazing' her brain.

It was later removed by surgeons in Pakistan 
before she was flown to the UK for specialist treatment at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

The Taliban have vowed to target her again.

Medics said that Malala will be re-admitted later this month or early February to undergo reconstructive surgery on her skull.

She will visit the hospital every week to attend out-patient clinical appointments where doctors will assess her progress.

Medical
 Director Dr Dave Rosser said: 'Malala is a strong young woman and has 
worked hard with the people caring for her to make excellent progress in
 her recovery.

'Following 
discussions with Malala and her medical team, we decided that she would 
benefit from being at home with her parents and two brothers.

access to education in the country

'She will return to the hospital as 
an outpatient and our therapies team will continue to work with her at 
home to supervise her onward care.

'Over the past couple of weeks Malala
 has been leaving the hospital on a regular basis on 'home leave' to 
spend time with her father Ziauddin, mother Toorpekai and younger 
brothers, Khushal and Atul.

'During those visits assessments have
 been carried out by her medical team to ensure she can continue to make
 good progress outside the hospital.'

Meanwhile, Malala is now likely to 
secure permanent residence in the UK after her father was granted a job 
with the Pakistani consulate in Birmingham.

Treatment: Malala was taken to hospital in Pakistan and later flown to Britain for specialist treatment at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital.The Taliban have vowed to target her again

Since Malala was shot there have been a number of candlelit vigils in Birmingham and across the world to pray for her recovery.

Celebrities including Madonna and Angelina Jolie have joined millions of people across the world to support Malala.

There are growing calls for her to be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Since her arrival in Britain there have been concerns for the teenager’s safety.

Just a day after she was admitted, well-wishers had to be turned away from the hospital after they turned up claiming to be family members.

And in November the shooting, banned hate preacher Sheikh Omar Bakri sparked global outrage when he threatened to issue a fatwa - a death sentence - against Malala - when he branded her “a traitor to Islam.”

Honoured: A Pakistani police officer stands guard outside the college which was named after Malala, in Swat, Pakistan. The Taliban have vowed to target her again.

Ziauddin Yousafzai has been appointed education attache for three years, with the option of an extension for a further two years afterwards.

Both he and his daughter have had threats made against their lives by the Taliban since the shooting.

Malala's British doctors have been delighted with her ongoing recovery.

Dr Rosser said: 'Malala has continued to make great progress in her treatment.

'A number of QEHB's multi-specialist doctors have been working alongside colleagues from Birmingham Children's Hospital to treat her.'
