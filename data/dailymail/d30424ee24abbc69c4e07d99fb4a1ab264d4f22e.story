Michael Dawson watched his older brother Andy become a Hull City legend as he helped them from the bottom division to the Premier League.

Such is the fondness and respect for the elder sibling on Humberside, supporters once mocked England international Michael with chants of ‘You’re just a s**t Andy Dawson’ when he appeared at the KC Stadium with Spurs.

But now Dawson Jnr is a Tiger himself - completing a £3.5million move from White Hart Lane earlier this week - and will make his debut at Aston Villa tomorrow.

Fresh start: New Hull signing Michael Dawson salutes the KC Stadium as he's presented to the crowd 

It will be a case of role reversal for Dawson Snr, watching his brother in the black and amber of the club he served for 10 years.

Michael, though, is determined to forge his own favouritism among the club’s followers.

‘Obviously Andy had 10 years at this football club and had a great career here,’ he said. ‘He played in every league for them. Now it’s down to me to get on with my own career and perform, and I’m sure he will be here supporting me whenever he can.

Family affair: Michael's elder brother Andy played for Hull for 10 years before leaving last summer

‘It’ll be different to play here because I was used to coming to watch him. It’s just about me now, getting my head down and working hard for my team-mates and the whole football club.’

Dawson was afforded a rousing welcome at half-time during Thursday night’s 2-1 victory over Sporting Lokeren – Hull exited the Europa League on the away-goals rule – but that was in stark contrast to the jibes he received during a 1-1 draw with Spurs in February.

Earning his Spurs: Dawson has moved north in search of regular first-team football 

‘That was all light-hearted,’ said the 30-year-old. ‘Had Spurs not been 1-0 down at the time I might have given them a wave, but it was all good fun.

‘The reception I got on Thursday night was massive, it was a massive welcome and I am looking forward to repaying them for signing me and I’m sure the fans will be right behind me.’
