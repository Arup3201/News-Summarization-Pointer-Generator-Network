Joe Biden is under pressure after insisting that the U.S. consulate in Benghazi did not ask for additional security before it was attacked on September 11 - despite what diplomats and State Department officials have said.

Paul Ryan spent much of last night's vice-presidential debate hitting out at the administration's handling of the Libya assault which killed ambassador Chris Stevens and four other Americans.

The Vice President defended the government's handling of the crisis and denied that the State Department had turned down a request for security reinforcements in the months before the raid.

The lively debate exchange came just hours after presidential candidate Mitt Romney launched his own denunciation of Barack Obama's response to the attack, saying the administration 'failed to grasp the seriousness of the challenges that we face'.

Showdown: Joe Biden faced off against Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan last night

Denial: Biden claimed that he didn't know U.S. officials in Benghazi had asked for additional security before the consulate attack, an apparent contradiction

Earlier this week, it was revealed that Stevens himself expressed concerns about security at the facility.

Also, the head of a special operations team helping out with security asked for 'more, not less' reinforcements before the government pulled dozens from Libya earlier this year.

But Biden, when asked about it by debate moderator Martha Raddatz, said: 'We weren't told they wanted more security there.'

Ryan kept up his attack, saying: 'There were requests for extra security - those requests were not honoured.'

He compared the situation in Libya with the heavily guarded American embassy in France as he insisted: 'Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine detachment
guarding him, shouldn't we have a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in
Benghazi?'

Clash: The pair disagreed over many aspects of how the administration handled the crisis

The Vice President attempted to deflect the blame for the security failures onto Republicans in Congress, saying that Ryan's fiscal plan 'cut embassy security in his budget by $300million below what we asked for.'

The pair also sparred over another controversial issue connected to the Benghazi assault, as Biden again insisted that the administration initially believed the deadly raid was the result of protests over an anti-Muslim YouTube video which were sweeping the Islamic world at the time.

'The intelligence community told us that,' he said. 'As they learned 
more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment.'

But Ryan replied: 'It took the President two weeks to acknowledge this was a terrorist 
attack. He went to the UN and in his speech at the UN 
six times talked about the YouTube video. 

'Look, if we are hit by terrorists, we are going to call it for what it is: a terrorist attack.'

Criticism: Mitt Romney also launched an attack on the President's handling of the deadly raid

Former presidential candidate Newt Gingrich predicted on Friday that Biden's uncompromising statements would 'haunt' the Obama campaign ahead of next month's election.

'Biden on Benghazi was so wrong last night, it’s going to haunt them from now until the next debate,' the former House speaker told CBS This Morning.

Romney also launched a blistering assault on the Obama administration's treatment of the crisis as he spoke at a campaign rally in North Carolina.

After an Obama official suggested that the tragedy had been politicised by Republicans, the GOP candidate responded: 'I think today we got another indication of how President Obama and his 
campaign fail to grasp the seriousness of the challenges that we face 
here in America.'

He continued: 'Mr President, this is an issue because we were attacked successfully by terrorists on the anniversary of 9/11.

'President
Obama, this is an issue because Americans wonder why it was it took so 
long for you and your administration to admit that this was a terrorist 
attack.'

Rage: A protester holding his rifle during the assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th

Hours before the debate, two top 
security officials who had been to the consulate testified on Capitol 
Hill that they had made requests for more troops.

Former regional security forces officer Eric Nordstrom and Lt Col Andrew Wood, who
was head of a Special Forces 'Site Security Team' in the country, 
placed blame on Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charlene Lamb for 
rejecting their requests.

'The takeaway... for me and my staff, was abundantly clear - we were not 
going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident,' Nordstrom 
said. 'And the question that 
we would ask is: how thin does the ice have to get before someone falls 
through?'

'We were fighting a losing battle,' Wood added. 'We couldn't even keep what we had.'

Lamb
and Patrick Kennedy, the undersecretary for management, testified that 
they believed the security measures in place were enough.

Attack: Four U.S. citizens died in the raid on the consulate in Benghazi, including Mr Stevens

On September 11, the day he died, Stevens wrote to Washington officials detailing a dispute involving the leaders of two prominent Benghazi militias who were responsible for security in the city, according to the Daily Beast.

The two men, Wissam bin Ahmed and Muhammad al-Gharabi, claimed that the U.S. was lobbying for centrist politician Mahmoud Jibril to become Libya's prime minister.

They said that if he won the vote, they 'would not continue to guarantee security in Benghazi, a critical function they asserted they were currently providing,' according to Stevens.

Despite that warning, Stevens did not ask for more U.S. troops, and commented that Benghazi officials believed the city was becoming safer.

The cable made no mention of a U.S.-made
YouTube video mocking the Prophet Muhammad which was originally thought
to have been the motivation for the deadly assault on the consulate 
later that night.

Pleas: Lt. Col. Andrew Wood said he asked for reinforcements in Libya but faced troop withdrawals instead

The American compound was being guarded 
by members of the 'February 17 Martyrs Brigade', a militia which shared 
members with the groups run by Mr bin Ahmed and Mr al-Gharabi.

It was not only Stevens who saw potential security issues cropping up in Libya before the September 11 raid.

Wood said officials felt 'like we were being asked to play the piano with two fingers' after a number of troops were withdrawn from Libya in August.

He told CBS This Morning that worried embassy staff had approached him to ask if they would still be safe when his team had left.

'I could only answer that what we were being told is that they're working on it,' he said.

He added: 'Shooting instances occurred, many instances involved the local security guard force that we were training.

Aftermath: The U.S. consulate in Benghazi the day after last month's deadly assault

'Constantly,
there were battles going on between militias, criminal activity and 
that became an increasing danger as time went on as well.'

Wood claimed that other senior officials, including Stevens, had requested a boost in the U.S. security presence, saying: 'We felt we needed more, not less.'

Although his team was based in the city's capital Tripoli, Wood said he would have accompanied the ambassador to Benghazi had he still been in the country.

State Department officials said that as the Site Security Team was intended to help re-open the embassy in Tripoli, their departure from Libya was irrelevant to the subsequent security situation.

They also claimed that Wood did not know the details of the situation in Benghazi, which is 400 miles from the capital.
