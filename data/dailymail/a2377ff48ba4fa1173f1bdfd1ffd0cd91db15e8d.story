After tackling Britain’s unhealthy school dinners, Jamie Oliver has turned his attention to a new scandal of ‘criminal’ proportions.

The celebrity chef says thousands of tonnes of wonky fruit and vegetables are being thrown away every year because supermarkets do not want to buy imperfect produce – and Britons do not want to eat it.

During an investigation for a new TV show, Oliver said the amount of misshapen food cast aside was ‘bonkers’.

Now, Asda has agreed to launch a trial selling ‘ugly’ vegetables at a discounted price to see if customers will bite.

The new ‘Beautiful on the Inside’ range will be sold in-store for a third less than more attractive produce, in a bid to support farmers who might otherwise have to throw it away.

The initiative was sparked by an investigation into food waste by Oliver and farmer Jimmy Doherty for Channel 4’s Friday Night Feast, which airs tomorrow night.

The first programme shows farmers complaining that they cannot sell tonnes of perfectly edible fruit and vegetables because they are oddly-shaped.

They asked Asda to carry out an in-store trial to see if customers would be willing to buy lumpy carrots and potatoes and knobbly apples and pears if they were cheaper.

It will be launched on January 26, with the aim of rolling it out nationwide if it proves popular.

The UK’s second largest supermarket said its own survey showed two-thirds of customers would be open to buying wonky produce while three-quarters would ‘definitely’ do so if it was cheaper.

According to the Guardian, Oliver, 39, said: ‘If most Brits had half an idea of the amount going to waste, they’d be snapping up ugly veg by the trolley load.

Thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables are being thrown away every year by supermarkets as they believe their customers do not want to buy imperfect produce 

‘There’s no difference whatsoever in taste or nutritional value.

‘This is perfectly good food that could and should be eaten by humans.

‘When half a million people in the UK are relying on food banks, this waste isn’t just bonkers – it’s bordering on criminal.’

It is the latest crusade for the Essex-born chef who, a decade ago, launched his campaign against high-calorie school meals.

For his Jamie's School Dinners series in 2005, he visited a school in south-east London, and insisted it scrap Turkey Twizzlers and chips in favour of healthy foods such as fish and broccoli.

This led to the wider Feed Me Better campaign, which prompting new Government guidance on school dinners nationwide.

In 2009, the European Commission scrapped controversial rules which prevented misshapen produce being sold in Europe.

Under the bizarre EU rules, bananas had to be ‘free of abnormal curvature’ and at least 14cm in length, while Class A cucumbers had to be ‘practically straight’.

The draconian law meant up to a fifth of all fruit and vegetables produced was being rejected by shops because they failed to meet the required standards.

Supermarket chain Asda claims that its customers appear to be coming around to the idea of imperfect produce such as unusual shaped carrots, left, and misshapen peppers, right 

When it was axed six years ago, the EU's then-agriculture commissioner called it ‘a new dawn for the curvy cucumber and the knobbly carrot’.

But despite the changes, imperfect fruit and vegetables remains a rarity on the shelves of Britain’s major supermarkets – something farmers blame on the retailers.

Now Asda claims that its customers appear to be coming around to the idea of imperfect produce.

Ian Harrison, of Asda, said: ‘Even if fruit and veg have some knobbles and blemishes, this doesn’t affect the quality or taste – a carrot is still a carrot.

‘Customers are simply looking for great-tasting, fresh produce at a value price.

‘Our growers are savvy and already use a large percentage of this wonky crop for further processing, for things like ready meals and juicing, but we saw an opportunity to extend this even more.’

In tonight’s programme, which starts at 8pm, Oliver and Doherty will meet farmers Olly and Kevin Hammond, who have been growing carrots and parsnips in Norfolk for more than 50 years.

Doherty said: ‘Anything that doesn’t make the grade gets chucked. It’s a massive waste for farmers.

‘Where ‘A’ grade carrots sell for £800 a tonne, they practically give the ugly ones away for animal feed for just £10.'
