Andrew Flintoff's Twenty20 comeback is gathering pace after Brisbane Heat coach Stuart Law revealed he expects to sign him for this winter's Big Bash League.

After five years in retirement the larger-than-life all-rounder made a surprise return to competitive action during this season's NatWest T20 Blast.

It looked as though it would be a damp squib as injury hit after just two outings for Lancashire, but in typical Flintoff style he picked the perfect moment to grab the limelight.

An injury to Kabir Ali saw him drafted in for T20 finals day, where a first-ball dismissal of Ian Bell and a couple of mighty sixes reminded everyone of his natural talent.

And his former Red Rose team-mate Law was clearly paying attention.

'We've had discussions with Freddie,' Law told the Manchester Evening News.

'If things go well, hopefully we will be able to confirm next week that he will play some part in the Big Bash for us.

'I am really excited by the idea. We get on really well and have had plenty of good times down the years during my time with Lancashire.

'He will be the biggest signing Brisbane Heat has made.'

Flintoff won the Ashes with England in 2005 and was a hugely popular all-rounder on the international scene

Flintoff could only realistically be termed the franchise's biggest draw in celebrity terms, but Law has made it clear he will not be coming merely as a gimmick.

'I have spoken to Fred and made it clear that this is not a holiday, but he told me cricket is number one for him, and that it is not about collecting cash, it's about winning trophies,' said Law.

'I am sure Fred will do the right thing for this team.

'He is a proud man. He is not after the cash, he wants to contribute to the team.

'We know we will not be getting Freddie at his best from 2005, but if he is anywhere close then he will be great for us.

'The Australian fans will love him. They won't get on his back. He will create a following here and will love it in Brisbane.'

After spending most of his retirement years flitting between television studios, charity engagements and, improbably, the boxing ring, 36-year-old Flintoff is understood to have missed the challenge of top-flight sport.

He trained alone for long spells to prove to Lancashire he was serious about a comeback and competed in the second XI before progressing to the first team.

Now he is eager to maximise his final stint in the game and could even enter the Indian Premier League auction if his mooted move to Australia is a success.
