It was one small step for little Georgie Craig… but a giant leap forward for him and his family.

The three-year-old was born with a condition that left him with movement problems and unable to communicate properly.

But thanks to a special ‘space suit’, he is making great strides towards overcoming his difficulties and learning to make his way in the world.

Baby steps: The three-year-old's parents feared Georgie might never walk until they found the specialist therapy not offered by the NHS

His parents Naomi Jamieson, 30, and Dean Craig, 28, a steel worker, feared Georgie, who has global development delay, might never walk.

They had almost given up hope until they began researching specialist therapies on the internet not offered by the NHS.

They discovered the TheraSuit, an assemblage of yellow rubber cords pioneered in Russia in the early 1970s to counteract the muscle wastage which astronauts experienced during long trips in space because of the lack of gravity.

It was later developed in America by therapists Izabela and Richard Koscielny, who have a daughter with cerebral palsy, as a way of helping disabled children gain the strength and endurance needed for movement.

It works by retraining the body to correct movement and reflexes. All the elements of the suit are connected with each other through the system of rubber cords and therapists can adjust it to hold the body in proper physical alignment.

Georgie had his first block of £5,000-a-month therapy using the suit, which also has knee pads, over the festive period at Therapy in Praxis centre in Harrogate, North Yorkshire - and to his parents’ delight has now taken 11 steps in a row.

Miss Jamieson, of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, said just to be told by the therapists there was hope Georgie would walk was ‘amazing’.

She said: ‘When all of this started we had no idea what would happen with Georgie, but to hear a specialist tell us that she was sure Georgie would walk - that was just massive for us.

‘When he was in the suit on Christmas Eve he took 11 unaided steps. It was the best Christmas present we could have ever hoped for and it really was a miracle.’

Miss Jamieson, also mother to Freya Craig, one, and Josh Jamieson, 12, added: ‘Georgie’s condition affects all parts of his development so the therapy has been targeting all areas.

‘It’s all through play therapy so he doesn’t realise he’s doing any work.

‘Wearing the specialised suit is the equivalent of running a marathon. After he has been in the suit for a few minutes, connections have been made in his brain so he knows what muscles to use.’

Georgie began the therapy last month and has been doing four days a week for three hours a day.

His family has been fundraising to pay for it with their ‘Go Georgie Go’ campaign. They have raised £7,000 and have set a target of £20,000 for further blocks of treatment.

Full-time carer Miss Jamieson said: ‘We just want to give him a better quality of life, and for one day to hold a conversation with him.

‘Because of his condition, I have to second guess everything - it’s literally 24/7 care with him. But he’s so determined, you can see the poor little thing get stressed and as his mum, you just want to make him better.’
