Roy Keane has revealed he knew how good Cristiano Ronaldo was the first time he saw him play for Sporting Lisbon.

The Real Madrid superstar played against Keane's Manchester United side in a friendly in 2003, and Sir Alex Ferguson signed the 18-year-old soon after his impressive display in Sporting's 3-1 win.

In his new autobiography The Second Half, out this week, Keane reminisces about the game, in particular the torrid time the Portuguese gave United defender John O'Shea.

'We were playing Sporting Lisbon to celebrate the opening of their stadium. I saw how good Ronaldo was that day. He was up against John O’Shea,' Keane said. 

Cristiano Ronaldo caused John O'Shea to have 'dizzy spells' when Sporting Lisbon faced Manchester United in a friendly, claims Roy Keane in his autobiography 'The Second Half'

Keane says he 'knew' that Ronaldo would become one of the best players in the world one day

Ronaldo won the Ballon D'Or in January 2014 as the world's best player for the year

'Sheasy ended up seeing the doctor at half time because he was actually having dizzy spells. The club concluded negotiations after the game.

'We always joked with Sheasy he had actually sealed the deal by playing like a f****** clown. In fairness to him, he was jet-lagged [from America] like the rest of us.'

Keane also praised Ronaldo's dedication and attitude, the legendary former hardman having played with the young forward for two years until Keane's acrimonious departure from Old Trafford in 2005.

'I liked Ronaldo straight away. he had a nice presence about him and a good attitude,' Keane said.

'After watching him train for a few days I thought: “This lad is going to be one of the best players in the world.”

'He was 17 but he was immediately one of the hardest working players at United. He was good looking and he knew it. Looking at some of the other players in front of the mirror I would think: "You f****** nugget". But Ronaldo had an innocence to him and a niceness.'

'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: "This is great isn’t it?". I went: "I used to play in these games Adrian". I wasn’t being cocky.

'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: "Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: "I liked your commentary last night". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me.

'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!"'

'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No.

'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best.

'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'

Keane enjoyed 12 full seasons at Old Trafford and was extremely successful during his time there

Ronaldo was also a success at United before completing a then world-record move to Real Madrid
