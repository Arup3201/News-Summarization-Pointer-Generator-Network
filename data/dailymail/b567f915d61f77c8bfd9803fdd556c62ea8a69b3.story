On the rather stodgy agenda of the House of Commons, you are more likely to find members tabling motions than standing on tables.

Nadine Dorries, however, appears happy to raise the bar – and probably a few eyebrows – with this pose on the terrace.

The outspoken Tory MP took advantage of the summer recess for a photoshoot for Tatler in a members-only area of Parliament - and then slammed Prime Minister David Cameron in an interview with the society magazine.

Turning the tables: Nadine Dorries strikes a pose on the House of Commons terrace

She branded him patronising and sexist and challenged him to 'spend more of his time being a Conservative'.

Ms Dorries dismissed the Prime 
Minister as 'a sheep in wolf's clothing' while praising his old rival 
Boris Johnson as a Tory who could reach out to ordinary voters.

She previously hit the headlines when
she denounced Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne as 'arrogant 
posh boys who don't know the price of milk'.

The MP for Mid Bedfordshire indicated
that she is still angry at his put-down of her at Prime Minister's 
Question's when he called her 'frustrated'.

She said: 'It was a patronising, 
sexist thing to do, and that's not the act of a statesman or someone 
worthy of the position of Prime Minister.'

Ms Dorries, 55, was in in towering 
£550 satin and leather Manolo Blahnik heels as she clambered on top of a
table to take in the view with the London Eye and the Thames as a backdrop.

She wore a £1,299 blue silk dress by designer Oscar de la Renta for the terrace pose.

She then changed into a £1,260 sequinned dress by Erdem – a label popular with Sarah Jessica Parker and Gwyneth Paltrow – for another shot, which shows her with hand on hip as she leans against the ornate Commons brickwork.

For anyone who suspected she was nursing catwalk ambitions, she had a clear message. 

‘I wouldn’t want to do this every day, but it is fun,’ she told the society magazine.

While the daring pictures show a new side to the Tory MP, she is accustomed to creating a stir in Westminster.

All in a day's work: She shows a different side in Tatler

She continued her broadside against the Mr Osborne in the Tatler interview, describing him as ‘a Machiavellian 
who manipulates people and practises dark arts’.

Under fire: Louise Mensch was criticised by Nadine Dorries

Despite her criticisms of the party 
leadership, Ms Dorries insisted that she was not a natural rebel and 
had, in the past, held Mr Cameron in great affection.

She said: 'I've never been disloyal to this 
party until now. If you had asked me even 18 months ago: "would you ever 
vote against your party"? I would have said: "no because the party is much
bigger and more important than me." And because I felt great affection 
for Dave in a sisterly brotherly kind of way.'

Amid intense speculation that Mr Johnson is positioning himself for a future Tory leadership challenge, she pointedly praised the London mayor.

'I love Boris. He reaches the parts that other politicians can't. And he had an office next to mine and I used to go and wake him up to make him vote,' she said.

'But what's important is that he does more than speak inwards into Westminster. There are millions of people out there who need to know that there are ordinary people in Parliament.

'They've got this impression of us, and we've got a responsibility to break that image.'

Just days ago she was locked in a 
catfight with MP Louise Mensch over the media’s portrayal of Prince 
Harry following his naked Las Vegas billiards party.

Mrs
Dorries accused the fellow Tory – who was in favour of publication of 
photos of the prince naked – of being ‘void of principle’. And she  
condemned Mrs Mensch, 41, for undermining women in Parliament, 
dismissing her as ‘an ultimate loyalist Cameroon, regardless of the 
issues’.
