A Miami man's plan to drown his 21-year-old wife in a jacuzzi in order to collect her life insurance policy failed when he couldn't keep her head under the water, a court heard on Monday.

Prosecutors labelled Michel Escoto a 'controlling, manipulative schemer' who plotted to murder his spouse, Wendy Trapaga, in October 2002 in order to claim $1 million from her death.

In the closing arguments of Escoto's murder trial in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, prosector Gail Levine told jurors that, after his plan failed, Escoto choked and beat Trapaga to death with a tire iron outside a Northwest Miami-Dade warehouse.

The closing arguments brought to an end a month of testimony that included more than 20 witnesses and hundreds of pieces of evidence, The Miami Herald reported.

Jurors will begin deliberating Tuesday.

Escoto, 42, who represented himself for most of the trial, is charged with first-degree murder and is facing life in prison.

Escoto's behavior throughout the trial has caused much courtroom drama.

At one point, Circuit Judge Marisa Tinkler Mendez sentenced Escoto to 30 days in jail for contempt of court after he threatened Jorge Borron, the civil lawyer for Trapagas family, who was testifying and proclaimed Escoto a murderer.

'For a moment, you got to see the real Michel Escoto,' Levine told jurors.

'Those are his true colors.'

On Monday he surprised observers by allowing 'stand-by' counsel Terry Lenamon to finish the case.

Lenamon attacked the prosecution's case, saying the state exaggerated and over-dramatized the evidence during the 'vilification of Michel Escoto'.

Yolanda Cerrillo was the star witness in the murder case against Michel Escoto on Tuesday, March 25, 2014. She testified that she helped Escoto plan and carry out the murder of his new bride, Wendy Trapaga, 21, in 2002

The prosecution called Yolanda Cerillo 'evil, pathetic and selfish' after she admitted to helping murder Wendy Trapaga

'This is not community theater,' Lenamon said.

'This is a court of law.'

Escoto was long the suspect in Trapaga's death.

Prosecutors described him as a womanizer who kept several ex-girlfriends, even as he planned Trapaga's demise.

He persuaded her to go along with the life insurance policy while pressuring her to marry him in a rushed courthouse wedding.

A few days after the ceremony they checked into the Executive Airport Motel at 6700 NW 12th St.

To police, he initially claimed the two left the motel after getting into an argument, and she stormed off on her own after dropping him off at their South Beach apartment.

The defense speculated that Trapaga, who they had 'multiple boyfriends' and 'was going to sex clubs', met up with someone who was the real killer.

'We don't know what occurs after she left the apartment,' Lenamon said.

Prosecutors shot back, citing the medical examination of her body - Trapaga was too drugged-up to have been able to drive Escoto home that night.

The state also had a powerful witness for the trial.

Escoto's ex-girlfriend, Yolanda Cerrillo, who admitted to jurors she helped him plan the murder by grinding up powerful painkillers to knock Trapaga out.

Together they also practiced how to drown the young woman, Cerrillo said.

She also admitted to whisking him away from the crime scene and agreeing on a cover story.

The details were intimate: Cerrillo described how the smell of blood made her so ill she had diarrhea and had to defecate on the side of a causeway as Escoto flung the murder weapon into Biscayne Bay.

'You don't make that up,' Levine said.

Cerrillo, 40, a Homestead accountant, began cooperating in 2006, but admitted she failed to tell investigators the full extent of her involvement until August 2011.

The state attorney's office, with little evidence against her, had no choice but to grant her immunity from prosecution.

'One sorry, pathetic soul. Evil. Selfish,' Levine told jurors, adding:

'I can't charge her. I'd love to. But I can't.'

Last fall, a civil jury ordered Cerrillo to pay Trapaga's family $44 million in a wrongful death lawsuit.

The defense, however, insisted that Cerrillo concocted the entire story only after she believed Escoto might have implicated her.
