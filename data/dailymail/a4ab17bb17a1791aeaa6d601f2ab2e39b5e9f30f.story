Outburst: A judge branded Colin Blake a 'serial rapist' when jailing him for attacking two women in 2010 and 2012 and told him he should never have been cleared of attacks on two other women

A judge has branded a 53-year-old man a 'serial rapist' when jailing him for attacking two women  telling him he should never have been found not guilty of two earlier assaults.

Judge Murray Shanks spoke out as he sentenced Colin Blake for attacking a woman in her own home last year and raping a 14-year-old girl in 2010.

He said that he had 'no doubt' that Blake had also forced himself on two further victims, aged 13 and 26.

Blake was tried for this alleged assaults in two separate hearings in 2006 and 2007 but found not guilty on both occasions.

Sentencing Blake at Snaresbrook Crown Court, Judge Shanks said: ‘Somehow you were acquitted by a jury of two previous rapes in 2006 and 2007 of a 13-year-old and a 26-year-old.

‘As I say, you have managed to persuade juries on those occasions and were found not guilty.

‘I have no doubt whatsoever that you raped those women.

‘In other words I am sure you are a serial rapist and you are capable of raping more women.

‘You have lied through all four of the
trials and even though acquitted it did not influence your behaviour, 
you just carried on as before.

He added: ‘You appear to have no insight as to the harm you have caused to other people.

‘All the evidence I have heard 
suggests you are a man who thinks he is entitled to sex at any time 
without regard to others’ feelings or even their age.’

Blake targeted his most recent victim, aged 26, in her own home in Woodford Green, east London, in August last year.

He had promised to take her out for an evening and asked to come in and wait while she got ready but soon began demanding sex.

When she turned him down, Blake forced her into her bedroom and raped her twice.

The fourth victim was a 14-year-old girl, who was attacked twice by Blake in September 2010.

He arranged to meet the teenager on the pretence of buying her new school uniform.

But instead he drove her to an address in Hackney, east London, before raping her and driving her home.

Later that month she awoke to find Blake groping her in her bedroom.

Blake, of Watford, Hertfordshire, had denied two counts of rape and one of sexual assault.
