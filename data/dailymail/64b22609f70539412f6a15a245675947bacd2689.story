A Spanish councillor has quit her job after a home-made porn movie she made was leaked online.

Olvido Hormigos Carpio resigned today after the intimate clip went viral on social networks across the country.

The graphic footage showed her naked and pleasuring herself alone on a bed.

Home-made movie: This footage of Spanish councillor Olvido Hormigos Carpio naked went viral on web

The clip quickly spread around the town of 6,500 people before it was posted on YouTube.

Carpio branded the leak 'an attack on her privacy,' it was reported by Spanish newspaper El Mundo.

The footage was taken off YouTube this morning after Hormigos complained to the California-based site.

Attack of privacy: Carpio branded the leak 'an attack on her privacy' and has claimed she is handing in her notice

She claimed she was handing in her notice 'out of respect for her family and to her party, the PSOE'.

The mother-of-two is one of six Socialist politicians in the Toledo town of Los Yébenes, 80 miles south of capital Madrid.

Tomorrow the town council is expected to accept the primary school teacher's resignation. 

She has also reported the 'distribution' of the film to Spain's Civil Guard police.

Town Mayor Pedro Acevedo, of the opposing Popular Party, confirmed to El Mundo that Hormigos has resigned due to a 'thorny issue'.

It is unclear who spread the video around the town or who posted it on YouTube.

Leaked sex tapes have ended many political careers around the world.

Indian politician Abhishek Manu Singhvi, 53, a senior Congress party spokesman, quit his post and his chairmanship of a parliamentary committee on law and justice in April this year after a tape was leaked allegedly showing him having sex with a female colleague in his legal chambers.

In 2010, the leader of Turkey’s main secular opposition party Deniz Baykal resigned after the release of a YouTube video purportedly showing him and a woman in a bedroom. The married man said he was a victim of a conspiracy.

Then in 2011, ten senior Turkish politicians resigned after the Turkish media reported that the Nationalist Action Party lawmakers were shown on the compromising videos leaked on the internet, reportedly filmed in a house that party members used for extramarital affairs.
