Argument: Jeremiah Adebolajo says his brother Michael's murder of Lee Rigby was 'inevitable' and had an 'obvious' justification

The brother of one of Lee Rigby's murderers said today the attack on the soldier was 'inevitable' and the justification for his death was 'obvious'.

Jeremiah Adebolajo, who like his now-convicted brother Michael is a Muslim convert, predicted another Woolwich-style attack due to Britain's foreign policy.

The 26-year-old, who was banned from some of his brother's trial for security reasons, also said that Fusilier Rigby was a violent man like his sibling.

'I suggest that it won't be the last, simply because of the tactics of the British secret service and foreign policy. For every violent action is a violent reaction,' he told Al Jazeera's Investigations Unit.

'Is it justified for a Muslim to attack a member of an army that is occupying Muslim lands?'

'This is something for the scholars and I think it's obvious to most people,' he added. 'The events to me were inevitable. There was eventually going to be another attack which mentioned foreign policy as its justification.'

In the interview he claimed his brother's 
actions were a direct consequence of the West's 'war on terror' and 
likened the killing of Fusilier Rigby to US drone strikes on Muslim 
countries.

He said: 'I would say, was Lee Rigby a violent individual? Are other British soldiers who go to Afghanistan and Iraq and kill violent individuals?'

'The point he's trying to make is the fact that the geographical location of the battlefield, since this war on terror, has basically disappeared. When we have people driving on roads in Afghanistan and targeted by drones, we have to ask ourselves the question, are these people soldiers? Is this a battlefield?'

He told Al Jazeera his brother was not radicalised, despite associations with radical preachers and the now disbanded group al Muhajiroun.

He said: 'It's a very tidy narrative to assume that we have this young Christian boy who was radicalised by these bogeymen-like figures - Anjem Choudary, Omar Bakri Muhammad - and while he went on this conveyor belt, as it were, of radicalisation and then the events of Woolwich happened. It's just not true.'

Theory: Jeremiah told Al Jazeera that his brother was a violent man but so was Lee Rigby because he was a soldier

Jeremiah claimed the British security services were aware of alleged mistreatment of his brother by Kenyan police while he was in custody in 2010 and added: 'They were complicit in allowing him to be interrogated with the means of interrogation that the Kenyans chose. Questions are to be asked about why they allowed the Kenyans to torture a British citizen.'

Jeremiah said he has been approached by an MI5 officer assigned to his brother, adding the security services were 'putting a lot of pressure' on Adebolajo and were 'really disrupting his life' right up to 'a few months before' the Woolwich attack.

In 2010 Michael Adebolajo had tried to travel to Somalia but was captured in Kenya and brought back to the UK.

MailOnline
 can now report it was a SAS unit that ‘snatched’ him as he prepared to 
enter the war-torn countries for terror training and to fight for the Al
 Qaeda linked terrorism group Al-Shabaab.

But he never made it across the border and Kenyan officials believe he was arrested north-east of the resort of Lamu.

Sources say it was then that MI5 'tried to recruit' Adebolajo to inform them about other extremists for cash.

Referring to the links to the secret services Adebolajo said during the trial: 'There's a lot more to the story but I won't mention that.'

A friend of Michael Adebolajo, Abu Baraa, told ITV News that the claimed approaches by MI5 became too much.

He said: 'I think he felt that MI5 were destroying his life and that his life as he knew it was over and he had no control over his own future and I think he wanted to take that control into his own hands rather than leaving it up to MI5.

'After he was brought back to Britain, he felt he was driven into a corner.'

An HM Courts and Tribunals Service 
spokeswoman confirmed Jeremiah Adebolajo was banned from the Old Bailey 'for 
security reasons' but this was later lifted.
