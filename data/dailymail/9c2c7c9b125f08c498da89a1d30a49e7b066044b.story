Ed Miliband will today pledge that his Labour Party manifesto will be even more radical than Michael Foot’s.

He will declare that he wants to go further than both Tony Blair’s New Labour and the ‘Old’ Labour personified by the likes of Mr Foot, Ken Livingstone and Tony Benn.

Mr Miliband will argue that the challenges facing Britain are so serious that only sweeping changes will do.

Radical move? Ed Miliband vows to go even further with sweeping changes than his predecessors such as Michael Foot (left), whose far-left manifesto was famously dubbed 'the longest suicide note in history'

Mr Foot’s far-Left 1983 manifesto called for mass nationalisation of industry, new taxes on the rich and unilateral nuclear disarmament. It was famously dubbed the ‘longest suicide note in history’ by one of the party’s own MPs.

But in a speech to Labour’s National Policy Forum in Milton Keynes, Mr Miliband will say: ‘We have moved on from New Labour.

'And we are not going back to Old Labour.

'Instead, our programme for government is more radical and more ambitious in the change we seek, crafted for the age we are living in and the challenges we face.’

Labour activists will lay the groundwork for Mr Miliband’s manifesto at the forum, with policy proposals set to include a return to nationalisation and higher taxes on the rich, with a 50p top rate and ‘mansion tax’ widely expected.

Mr Miliband will say Labour needs to ‘fundamentally reshape our economy’ in order to tackle ‘inequality and unfairness’.

Condemned: Miliband took a swipe at Tony Blair's government for not doing enough to eliminate inequality

In a swipe at Mr Blair’s New Labour, he will say: ‘We did great things in government. But we did not do enough to reduce inequality, or eliminate the problem of low pay, or build an economy that will work for the next generation.

'And the reason is that we did not do enough to change the fundamentals of the economy.’

Mr Miliband will also warn activists that Labour cannot return immediately return to the free-spending ways of the past because of the need to tackle the country’s huge budget deficit it ran up when the party was last in office.

And in comments that are likely to provoke further concern among business leaders, he will reiterate his commitment to major interventions in markets that he believes to be failing the general public.

Mr Miliband will say Labour is ‘moving on from a time when rising inequality was just a fact of life – or when we acted as if there is nothing we could do about markets that aren’t fair or aren’t working’.

He will claim that more can indeed be done, by forcing businesses to pay a higher minimum wage and imposing a price freeze on energy firms.

Mr Miliband will also promise to build 200,000 new homes a year, curb the use of zero-hours contracts and abolish the spare-room subsidy – known by its critics as the bedroom tax.
