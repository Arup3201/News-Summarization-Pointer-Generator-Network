When the big fights don’t happen the public lose faith. That is happening with Floyd Mayweather.

He is the king of the ring and the king of making money. But fight week seems particularly flat and I’m hearing from my people in America that there is not the buzz or even much interest in his fight with Marcos Maidana.

He should be fighting Manny Pacquiao. That fight is credible again after he beat Timothy Bradley and it is ridiculous that they are not facing each other.

What fans want: Viewing figures suggest Mayweather's next bout could draw fewer than 1million buys

Eye on the throne: Maidana will be the massive underdog against Mayweather on May 3 in Las Vegas

Impressive: Manny Pacquiao showed he still has the goods in his dominant win over Timothy Bradley

Drawcard: It's ridiculous that Pacquiao isn't fighting Mayweather as that is the fight the fans really want

This fight with Maidana has gone right under the radar. People know what to expect – a masterclass from Mayweather and an easy night. I might be wrong but that’s how I see it. Many are talking about projected pay-per-view numbers of less than one million, which for Mayweather is weak. It shows that people are losing interest.

Mayweather will continue to make huge money, but the only fight people want to see Mayweather take is Pacquiao.

I think people have got bored of not getting what they want and if you are continuously asking people to put their hand in their pocket, you have to give them what they want. 

Kell Brook’s long wait for a world title shot is nearly over. Shawn Porter’s knockout win over Paulie Malignaggi this month has meant that Porter must now defend his IBF title against Brook, the mandatory challenger, by July 19 or vacate the belt. Plenty has been going on behind the scenes with this one and I can tell you more here.

I have already spoken to Richard 
Schaefer this week, the CEO of Golden Boy Promotions, who look after 
Porter, and I have told him that I want to bring this fight to the UK. 
All being well, my offer would be to stage the fight in Sheffield, 
possibly on July 12.

Time has come: Kell Brook will finally get his shot at a world title now Shawn Porter is obligated to defend

Return: Brook could take on Porter in Sheffield, where Kell took down Ukranian Vyacheslav Senchenko

Richard is happy to listen to offers but there is a long way to go. Ultimately, they would like the fight in America and we have no problem with that, but I think it makes more sense for it to be in the UK.

There is more interest for it here because Porter doesn’t yet put bums on seats in America and that fight doesn’t carry main event pull with the network.

I suspect Richard Schaefer and 
Porter’s adviser, Al Haymon, are worried about this fight. Porter was 
good against Malignaggi, but he can’t afford to be as reckless as he was
 against someone with the power and accuracy as Kell Brook - he can be
 utterly devastating, an incredible talent, and they know that. Will it 
put them off taking the fight and vacating? Maybe.

Golden
 Boy will be thinking that they are taking on a guy who can beat their 
kid and also that they will have no future options on him. Their 
alternative is to vacate, but that’s a big step.

Oscar de la Hoya recently tweeted 
about Keith Thurman, but I’m not sure that a fight between him and 
Porter makes sense for anyone just yet. My personal feeling is that the 
fight with Brook will happen - Porter is a fighter so he won’t want to 
vacate - and I hope by the end of this week to have an indication of the
 details.

I would love nothing more than for Kell to get this fight. He has had so many moments when for one reason or another his title shot has been cancelled. This will be his big fight and he will finally get the world title he has deserved for so long.

It will be a very tough fight and I’m very confident  he will win. People think Brook won’t want the fight – no chance. He is already hard in camp having spent the last few weeks up the mountain in Big Bear in California.

Porter looked brilliant in his last fight, he has never been renowned as concussive puncher and many of his knockouts came against quite weak opposition early in his career. Malignaggi is obviously a top-level fighter, but how much did he have left in that fight?

I also remember Porter drawing against Julio Diaz, who is quite poor to be honest. So yes, the Americans might want to make Kell an underdog. But that is a huge mistake.

I have spoken to the McGuigans and we are hoping to meet next week to start discussions for an enormous fight between Carl Frampton and Scott Quigg.

I've talked about how I think the lack of interest in Mayweather's forthcoming fight with Maidana proves that people have got bored and frustrated of waiting for that Pacquiao meeting, and we will not make that mistake with Frampton and Quigg, the WBA super-bantamweight world champion who I promote. Frampton’s camp have been calling me out on Twitter, saying talk is cheap.

No time wasting: Carl Frampton (left) versus Scott Quigg (right) is a fight that shouldn't be delayed

Well, I am the one who really wants to move this thing on and I am the one who has made the offers. I want Quigg and Frampton to fight each other next. No more waiting around.

I have made substantial offers in the past. And I am not asking for any future options on Frampton – I said that in my last column. Let’s just make the world title fight that everyone wants to see.

I will have a rematch clause in place but that is no penalty. If Frampton can beat Quigg like he thinks he can, then let’s have a rematch in Belfast and it will be another huge payday for everyone. I don’t see the downside of a rematch clause.

The champ: Quigg defended his WBA World Super Bantamweight title knocking out Tshifhiwa Munyai

Bring it on: Quigg's camp wants the next fight to be against Frampton, no more waiting around

Every time both guys fight, they look impressive. Whenever Frampton fights, everyone says, ‘Wow, he would beat Quigg’. When Quigg fights, everyone says, ‘Wow, he would beat Frampton’.

These are two warriors at the top of their game. Let’s not have any of this rubbish we have seen with Mayweather and Pacquiao. Let’s get this fight on. 

We are talking to Golden Boy about Leo Santa Cruz and we are also talking to Kiko Martinez’s people. Those are two unification fights. But we want Frampton. And the public want it, too.

Amir Khan is also fighting against Luis Collazo this weekend and I think there could be trouble. It’s likely that he has been promised internally that this will be a springboard to Mayweather, but I worry about Khan here. I always worry about him at elite level and this fight especially.

Collazo is not the greatest in this 
division, but he is long in the tooth, a southpaw, dangerous and active.
 Khan is not active – he has not fought in a year and has fought only 
twice since summer 2012. I can’t see how you go into a fight like this 
after such an absence. It’s a massive risk.

Risk: Collazo could be a stepping stone to Mayweather but is dangerous, as shown against Victor Ortiz

I have to mention Anthony Crolla. His win against John Murray for the WBO intercontinental lightweight title was brutal and brilliant.

He took his time, soaked up some punishment off a very good fighter and stopped him late on. In my opinion, he deserves a world title shot and I will deliver it as well.

I am now in talks with the 
representatives of Richar Abril, the WBA world champion, and I expect to
 make that fight this summer. That will be a huge night in Manchester.

Punishment: Anthony Crolla lands a heavy left on John Murray in his impressive victory

Ready for his shot: Crolla fought smart and deserves a tilt at a world title, which he should get

Crolla is one of the nicest blokes you will meet in boxing, but he is also extremely determined and extremely talented. He lost in Prizefighter not so long ago and look at him now.

The arrival of his son recently has sharpened his mind and I would say he is not only ready for a title shot but also to win the belt.

Special credit to Joe Gallagher who despite criticism in the build up to that fight works tirelessly for his fighters and constructed the perfect game plans for Crolla and Quigg.

It is a new era for Matchroom as we will be holding our first show at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on May 21.

We have been looking for an excuse to go to the arena and now we have one in the talented featherweight Josh Warrington, who is fresh off an impressive win over Rendall Munroe.

He will defend his commonwealth title against Martin Lindsay while Stephen Smith is in the fight of his life against WBC silver champion  Fernando Saucedo in an official WBC World title eliminator.
