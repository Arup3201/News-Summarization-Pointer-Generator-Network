A man was arrested after police found him smeared in tar on the roof of a convenience store in Daytona Beach, Florida, at 3 a.m. on Tuesday morning.

When cops found Joshue Holoman, 30, he was trying to break into the Sunoco store through an air conditioning shaft.

Despite being caught with a makeshift prying tool, Holoman first attempted to convince police that he was visiting family.

When they didn’t believe him, the Orlando man then told officers he was a repairman who was atop the building because he heard the air conditioners making noise.

Once again officers didn't believe him and next Holoman told officers that he had been sleeping on the roof and had smeared tar on himself so he wouldn't be seen. 

Holoman has been charged with two counts of attempted burglary of an unoccupied structure, possession of burglary tools and criminal mischief, an arrest report shows. 

Officers were called to the closed business by a witness who heard a strange noises like whistling, snorting, a torch sound and rattling fence coming from the back of the business, police said.

While being taken to jail, Holoman became violent and broke a $500 metal panel inside the prisoner transport vehicle, police said. He remained jailed on $4,000 bail Wednesday.

He had earlier been spotted on the roof of the nearby comedy club Grandview Live, reports The Daytona Beach News-Journal.
