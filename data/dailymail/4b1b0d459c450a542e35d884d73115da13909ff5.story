A glass of wine or a relaxing bath can be the perfect remedy after a stressful day. And now you can combine the two without fear of spilling a drop thanks to a new invention.

A pair of brothers from the U.S. have created the 'SipCaddy' - a portable cup holder that can hold wine glasses that can be attached to the side of a bath or shower.

It has a suction pad that sticks to smooth surfaces and it can hold beer cans, bottles, cups, and many other household items.

Unwind: A new invention allows people to relax in the bath while enjoying a glass of wine

SipCaddy was designed and developed by a small team of drinking enthusiasts, architects, and designers, led by two brothers, Carson and Keefe.

The creators say that the $13.95 (£8.91) cup holder is ideal for enjoying a glass of wine or cold beer in the bath.

The device is made of strong, durable, recyclable ABS plastic and is dishwasher safe. 

Versatile: The product can hold both wine glasses and cans and was developed by brothers in the U.S

The team say their product is different from other cup holders on the market because of its versatility. It can hold bottles, wine glasses, champagne flutes, slim coffee mugs, solo cups, regular cups, and a wide variety of bathroom products weighing up to 24oz. 

Carson, from Atlanta, who has a degree in economics from Georgia State University told MailOnline: 'I always joked around about drinking beer in the shower. When I researched it, there wasn't even a quality portable cup holder out there. 

'I saw that a few companies had a wine holder, but that idea has been done many times in the last 10 years and they are all far from innovative: all of them being just a flat piece of plastic with a slit in it. 

'I like baths too and it suddenly occurred to me that I could have a cup holder with a gap in the front that could hold stemware. This doesn't affect the functionality of the cup holder at all, it actually improves it because it allows it to expand.'

He added: 'I noticed that while there were all kinds of portable beverage holders available, all of them could hold either stemware or cups and cans, but none were designed to hold both.'

'It seemed like a niche we could fill with a novel, cool clean design and offer it in fun translucent colours, specifically for the shower and bath, but useful wherever a suction cup will stick.'

Carson joined forces with his brother, Keefe, who lives in Brooklyn and has a Masters in architecture from the New School in Manhattan and his own design/build firm, to make the product a reality.

After months of research including several rounds of digitally modeling the design and 3D printing the prototypes, SipCaddy was launched over the summer.

Carson explained: 'My brother did around 10 drawings and prototyped them using a 3D printer. We finally came up with the perfect design. While it appears simple, a lot of thought was put into the design to hold the largest variety of beverages possible. You'll be surprised how most are a perfect fit. It can hold cans from 6oz all the way up to 25oz. It also holds almost anything else you can think of.

He added: 'The designs were extensively prototyped using 3D printing, which allowed us to test and fine tune SipCaddy to hold the widest range of drinks possible, with the most efficient use of material and a clean look.

'Sipcaddy has really caught on quickly since its release in late August, and we're looking forward to releasing new colours in the new year. 

'We have recently been able to make it possible to ship internationally at very reasonable rates through our website, and we are fulfilling orders worldwide.' 

Cocktail party while you wash: The cup holders have been tested to hold items weighing 6oz to 24oz

The cup holders cost $13.95 (£8.91) and come in different colours but the manufacturers warn you should test the suction before placing a glass in it

However, the company warn on their website that users may have to experiment with their cup holder and surface to find the best stick and they advise against using glass.

They write: 'Even though we have the best suction cup, it still has to be applied properly and maintained like anything that involves a suction cup. We have found that giving it a little tiny lick or drop of moisture helps maintain the suction even better. 

'In bathroom environments, condensation and moisture on the surfaces may eventually weaken the suction. It is recommended to reapply the suction cup before use, and always test the SipCaddy before putting in your drink. We do not recommend using glass, as accidents can sometimes happen. Do not apply after there is condensation, make sure the surface is dry first.'
