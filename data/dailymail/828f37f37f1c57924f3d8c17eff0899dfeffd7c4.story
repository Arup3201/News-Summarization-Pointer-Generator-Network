A Queensland mother who received an anonymous note from neighbours complaining about her crying baby has urged them to come forward and hit out at her detractors for being 'so critical'.

Trish LaForty, 26, found the letter in her mailbox last Thursday after a day out with her 11-month-old son Will, which read: 'You may be able to ignore your baby crying but we are tired of listening to him crying non-stop all day.'

The mother, who lives in a Sunshine Coast apartment block with her son and partner Wil, posted a response and a copy of the note to a local community Facebook page and has since received global media attention.

Trish LaForty, 26, found a 'rude' note in her mailbox last week after a day out with her 11-month-old son Will

The Sunshine Coast mother posted it to a community Facebook page and has since received global attention

'I had no idea that it was this worldwide until this morning my dad said that I should Google my name, and it came up in all these different languages and I just thought "Wow that's crazy",' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I definitely wasn't expecting that when I put the little rant on Facebook.'

Ms LaForty wrote the post on the Sunny Coast Community Board in the hope the letter's authors would see it.

'Like being a parent isn't tough enough... You didn't even have the guts to come knock on our door,' she posted on the Facebook page.

'FYI Our baby doesn't cry "all day", he cries when he doesn't want do go to sleep, when he's getting his nappy changed and when I say "no" because I refuse to let him be spoiled and run around like he owns the joint.

'If you'd like to chat more, feel free to pop in. You obviously know where we live.'

The 26-year-old her has urged her neighbours to come forward and told detractors to stop being 'so critical'

Ms LaForty and her partner still don't know who sent the note, but they have their suspicions.

'We've talked to a couple of other neighbours and another lady in our block had received notes from somebody as well,' she said.

'Just about petty little things as well, like that they could hear their birds.

'I don't know if they're going to come forward now because they might be shamed.'

But Ms LaForty still wants the people who sent the note to come talk to her face-to-face.

'I guess I kind of hope that they would do that so maybe we could resolve whatever issues they seem to have,' she said.

'But if they don't that's not really our problem, it's them that are going to have to put up with our baby.' 

Many have jumped to Ms LaForty's defence but others have accused her of having a 'superiority complex'

Ms LaForty said after she posted the note on Facebook many people jumped to her defence, and she thought the issue had struck a nerve because of the way the situation was handled by her neighbours.

'People really believe that kids should be kids and it's part of growing up,' she said.

'But more so because of the way it was handled.

'The writer could have given more information or at least said who they were if they're really that concerned about our baby, instead of writing a rude note.'

And while many have jumped to Ms LaForty's defence, others have accused her of having a 'superiority complex'.

'Eurgh, I'd write that letter. Nothing worse than non stop barking dogs and screeching children. Sick of the "everyone should bow down to those who procreate". Shut em up!,' one reader wrote.

Ms LaForty said the issue struck a nerve because of the way the situation was handled by her neighbours

Another reader said: 'I don't see anything "insulting" about the letter. It may be seen as impatient or unsympathetic, but it's definitely not insulting.

'She sounds like one of those mothers who think that because she's got a baby, everyone else in the world must go out of their way to accommodate her.'

But Ms LaForty just dismisses her critics as 'trolls' and denies her son Will is as noisy as her neighbours say.

'If they're going to have children they're going to find out what it's like eventually,' she said.

'Maybe instead of being so critical they can offer a helping hand.'

Ms LaForty added: 'Will is not upset all the time or crying for hours on end.

'I'd be the first to admit it if my child was a terror.'
