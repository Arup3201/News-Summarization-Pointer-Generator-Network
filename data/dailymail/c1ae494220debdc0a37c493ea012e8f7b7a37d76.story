Have an idea for an unusual trip but don’t have the funds to pay for it? This could be the site for you.

A South African company has started a global crowdfunding travel website, aiming to raise the cash for those who can't afford to go on the holiday of a lifetime.

Mark Karimov, the CEO of Trevolta, said he wants to make travel more accessible and use crowdfunding as the means to make the dreams come true.

Trevolta the crowd-funding site. You, too, can get other people to pay for your trip of a lifetime

‘The idea is to make travels more accessible to people. It’s not a secret that most people don’t travel because it’s expensive,’ he said.

‘At Trevolta we allow people to raise funds for their travels using crowdfunding and sponsorships. Friends, family, inspired people can back the trip and make it a reality.’

And while some seem a little self-indulgent – taking a trip on Route 66 – and others appear a little overly optimistic– feeding the homeless in ten European countries – there are many worthwhile projects that people are trying to raise funds for.

Users have between 10 and 90 days to get their money but any cash you do raise, you get to keep (unlike other crowdfunding sites) although Trevolta will keep 5 per cent plus Paypal will take another 3.9 per cent.

Not getting his kicks: One Trevolta user wanted $10,000 to make a trip on Route 66. He only managed to raise $15

‘Some 
travels are really inspirational and travellers go on a journey not for 
themselves, but for other people – volunteering, charity, etc,’ said 
Karimov.

‘Mostly
 travels are not about destination, it’s about the process, about the 
impact and about making a difference either on your life or in someone 
else’s.

‘Today technology allows us to raise funds for all of that and more – connect with people and tell your story. Crowdfunding for travellers is one of those stories.’

Trevolta launched in January this year and has attracted 436,000 users raising £46,000 to date.

The company is earning money but Karimov knows that he has a tough journey ahead of him.

‘We will always stick to our vision – to make travels cheaper and accessible to everyone, so unless we find some gold mine, we will stick to finding the ways to increase our success stories,’ he said.

‘Even after finding gold in a mine we’re still probably going to fund some trips with it. Because nothing that you buy actually makes you richer – only travels.’
