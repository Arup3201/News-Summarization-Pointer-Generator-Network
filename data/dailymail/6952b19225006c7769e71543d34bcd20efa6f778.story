They are among thousands of endangered sea turtles who journey to the shore each year.

The Olive Ridley turtles arrive at the beach just a few days before each new moon to form one of the biggest arribadas - mass synchronised nesting.

As they arrive on land off the coast of Costa Rica, their large fins propel them forward and dig into the sand to decorate the beach with gentle waves.

Professional wildlife photographer Ingo Arndt, spent 20 days in Costa Rica to capture this magnificent sight.

The 45-year-old said: 'This is one of the most spectacular nature events that you can witness in the world.

'Nowhere else can you see such an enormous arribada.'

Each turtle lays around 80 to 100 soft-shell eggs in a shallow nest in the sand, before heading back to the ocean.Â

Prime targets for wild dogs and vultures, the locals try to protect the turtles and their eggs - collecting their own bounty in the process.

For the first two days of the arribada, the locals collect eggs which would otherwise be destroyed by the late arrivals which journey across the beach.

They then dedicate hours both night and day to clean the beach from driftwood and guard the turtles and their nests.

Ingo, from Langen, Germany, said: 'I met the locals and they absolutely love the turtles.

'They work around the clock to protect them and I found that I could get quite close to the turtles as they are used to having people there.

'Their only concern is laying the eggs.

'But in the water they are more shy and cannot see very well.

'So if you move very slowly, they think you are a drifting trunk and come close to rub their skin against you!'

Although over 10 million eggs are laid during each cycle, only a fraction of these will hatch.

And despite the best efforts of the locals, even fewer hatchlings will make it to the ocean.

Yet with turtles arriving on Ostional beach all year round, the legacy of the turtles is set to continue.Ingo said: 'I was speechless when I saw the turtles first arriving - I could not believe it.

'I have seen many spectacles of nature in my career around the world but this one was very unique.

'I could not believe that this huge arribadas still happens today.'
