Talented two-year-old Kool Kompany is to remain with trainer Richard Hannon after being bought by Australian Neil Werrett, best known as one of the syndicate which had a share in the great sprinter Black Caviar.

Kool Kompany, who has raced in the colours of the Middleham Park Racing syndicate, was bought privately after failing to make his reserve at Doncaster's Horses in Training Sale.

Hannon said: 'He didn't meet his reserve, but he has been bought by Neil Werrett who was involved with Black Caviar.

Staying put: Kool Kompany will remain with Richard Hannon

'Luckily he is staying with us and will be aimed at something like the Middle Park Stakes.

'I don't know if he will want to take him to Australia later on, but we're pleased he's still in the yard.'

Kool Kompany has twice won at group two level this summer in the Railway Stakes at the Curragh and the Prix Robert Papin at Maisons-Laffitte.

Plan: Hannon says Kool Kompany will be aimed at the Middle Park Stakes
