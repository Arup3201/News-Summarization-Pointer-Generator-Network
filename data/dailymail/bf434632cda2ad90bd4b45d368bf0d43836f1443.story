She came under fire for failing to acknowledge the death of TV rival Peaches Geldof.

And on Friday Katie Hopkins finally broke her silence as she explained the reason behind her actions in her latest column for The Sun.

Katie also used the column to make a 
scathing attack on the current trend for celebrities to flock to their 
Twitter accounts to 'outdo each other in public display of distress'.

And of course she didn't hesitate to offer her opinion on others who did acknowledge the TV presenter's death, or on what she felt was the real reason behind the tragic event.

Sharing her thoughts: Katie Hopkins finally broke her silence following the death of Peaches Geldof in her column for The Sun on Friday

The controversial TV personality made it
 clear that she felt it would inappropriate to tweet about Peaches when 
the deceased mother-of-two wouldn't have appreciated a tweet from her 
while she was alive.

Writing in her column she said: 'Peaches didn't want a tweet from me. She didn't welcome it in life. She certainly didn't need it in death.

'She was tough enough not to seek approval from anyone.'

The argumentative reality star surprisingly then paid her old foe a compliment as she added: 'I admire that trait in others.'

She went on to question 
why people expected to comment on the death of a woman she only met once
 on a 'TV sofa in central London', claiming that not only were the pair 
strangers but they were enemies following their infamous interaction.

She venomously argued that such statements were not sincere and were affecting the way society grieved in public.

The mother-of-two explained: 'I refused to be part of this revolting spectacle.'

Katie concluded her column stating that just as the world and media should offer the grieving family privacy, she was offering her privacy through her silence on the issue.

She wrote: 'Peaches didn't need tweets from celebrities or strangers - she just needed a mother's love'.

Her surprising words came too late as it was revealed that the reality star's scheduled appearance on Celebrity Juice on Thursday night was postponed due to the controversy surrounding Katie after Peaches' death.

The news was announced on the official Twitter account with a message that read: 'Hi Celebrity Juice Fans, Katie Hopkins appearance on the show has been postponed until the Autumn'.

Katie linked to the tweet with her own comment which read: 'I apologise for this decision guys - and look forward to joining Celeb Juice in September.'

Loss: Peaches leaves behind husband Thomas Cohen and two sons Astala and Phaedra

When the show's host, Leigh Frances (better known by his alter ego, Keith Lemon), was flooded with tweets from fans, he replied to one user: 'said it before many many times I don't book the guests'.

Police found Peaches' body at home in Wrotham, Kent, at 1.35pm on Monday and described the death as 'sudden' and 'unexplained'.

Peaches was found dead at the home she shared with her husband Thomas Cohen and their two sons, Astala, 23 months, and Phaedra, 11 months.

Police described her death as 'unexplained' and a post-mortem proved inconclusive. It could take up to three weeks for the results of toxicology reports could be used to try and find the cause of her passing.

Her body has been released to the family as they make funeral arrangements.

I respect you: Katie paid Peaches a surprising compliment as she revealed that the mother-of-two wasn't someone who seeked approval from others
