Ronny Deila believes he will soon be fending off interest in Stefan Johansen from English Premier League clubs.

The Norwegian midfielder has thrived since his former Stromsgodset manager moved to Glasgow last summer.

On the verge of adding the domestic Treble to the championship he won a year ago, the 24-year-old is also a forerunner for the player of the year awards.

And, speaking to a Norwegian TV station this week, Deila was asked how long he could keep the player at Celtic Park.

He replied: ‘It’s clear it’s difficult. He is good enough to play in the Premier League but then it is a question of whether he wants it.

‘I think Stefan is very fond of Celtic and it’s a much bigger club to play for than for example West Bromwich.

‘Stefan made a wise choice when he chose to go to Celtic. Here he is allowed to develop, not least physically. He has been playing regularly at a high level.’

Johansen, who also spoke with the Norwegian broadcaster TV2, was adamant that he had no immediate desire to leave Celtic, though.

‘The reason why I’m doing so well now is that I enjoy where I am,’ he said. ‘I see no reason why I should change clubs. I’m at a club that will win trophies, who have the ambition to play in Europe.’

Meanwhile, Queens Park Rangers are monitoring Jason Denayer’s situation.

The Premier League strugglers have had the Belgian watched several times recently with a move to a summer transfer.

Deila has stated that he’d like the defender to return to Glasgow for another year-long loan from Manchester City even though the player’s preference is a return to his parent club.

QPR boss Chris Ramsey remains hopeful of persuading Denayer to switch to London – regardless of what league his side are playing in.
