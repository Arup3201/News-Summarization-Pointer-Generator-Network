The launch of Malala Yousafzai’s memoir – I Am Malala – has been cancelled in her home province in north-west Pakistan amid fears that the event could be targeted by the Taliban.

The police have reportedly stated that they would not be able to provide security for the launch in Peshawar.

Malala was shot and wounded in October 2012 after opposing the Taliban’s restrictions on the education of girls.

Malala was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and has since made the UK her permanent home.

In her book, written with British journalist Christina Lamb, Malala details her extraordinary story and her continued role as an activist.

However, she is not universally liked in Pakistan, with some people suspecting that she is being used as a mouthpiece by the West.

Pressure to cancel the book launch also came from local government ministers, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Sarfraz Khan, director of the Area Study Centre at the University of Peshawar, which was to run the launch with the Bacha Khan Education Trust, is said to have received phone calls from two officials urging him to cancel the launch.

However, Imran Khan, the head of the PTI party, which has control of the province, said he was dismayed at the decision to cancel Tuesday’s event.

He tweeted: ‘Am at a loss 2 understand why Malala's book launch stopped in Peshawar. PTI believes in freedom of speech/debate, not censorship of ideas.’

In October 2013 Malala, accompanied by her father Ziauddin, gave the Queen a copy of her book during a meeting in the palace's White Drawing Room.

She told her: 'It is a great honour for me to be here, and I wanted to present you with this book.'

Accepting the gift, the Queen replied: 'That's very kind of you.'

Malala told the Queen she was passionate about every child having a right to an education, everywhere around the world.

She added: 'Especially in this country as well. I have heard about many children that can't go to school, and I want to continue our work.'

Malala received the Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience award for 2013 in recognition of her endeavours.
