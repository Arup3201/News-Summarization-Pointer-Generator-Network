The parents of a 14-year-old girl who died of carbon monoxide poisoning on a family camping holiday were yesterday recovering in hospital while coming to terms with news of her death.

Hannah Thomas-Jones was found alongside her mother, stepfather and younger brother, who were unconscious, when other family members tried to wake them on Sunday morning.

It is thought they were poisoned after leaving a disposable barbecue in their tent overnight to keep them warm as temperatures plummeted to 2c (36f).

Phil Jones, 49, his wife Danielle, 30,
and her son Ben, 11, were all taken to hospital and are now in a stable
condition – but Hannah was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mr and Mrs Jones, who are said to have
recovered and regained consciousness, are at Ben’s bedside at the Royal
Shrewsbury Hospital, while trying to deal with the news of Hannah’s 
death.

Ben was found in a more serious 
condition and had to be airlifted to hospital. Although his condition 
was said to be stable yesterday he was described as still being 
‘unwell’.

Last night, in a brief statement 
released from the hospital, Hannah’s family said: ‘Our priority is to 
ensure that the three people in hospital get well and are fully 
recovered. We are devastated by this tragic accident.’

The family had been camping over Bank 
Holiday weekend at a beauty spot in Bucknell, Shropshire with Mrs 
Jones’s two sisters and their partners and children. It is in an Area of
Outstanding Beauty, with views over the countryside.

They families decided to have a barbecue on Saturday evening in a central eating area around which their tents were pitched.

Dubbed the silent killer, carbon monoxide poisoning claims the lives of 25 people in Britain every year.

Research suggests the number of deaths could be higher than official figures suggest, as medical staff do not always test for poisoning.

As the gas is colourless and odourless, people with faulty appliances often fall unconscious without realising anything is wrong.

Portable BBQs must always be used in an area with proper ventilation, preferably outside, due to the potential rapid build up of the deadly 
gas.

Low levels of exposure can cause dizziness, headaches and flu-like symptoms. It can quickly knock someone out by depriving them of oxygen and at high levels can kill in minutes.

Wealthy
British businessman Philip Townsend, 55, and his wife MaryAnne, 52, are believed to have fallen victim to carbon monoxide while on holiday
in Estonia last month.

The couple died in a converted barn which they are believed to have bought last year.

Millionaire's
daughter Zoe Anderson, 24, (pictured) died from carbon monoxide 
poisoning after a gas fitter 'botched' a boiler installation in Bath, 
Somerset.

Andrew 
Hartley, 37, was convicted of manslaughter earlier this year after 
failing to properly secure the flue pipe to a new boiler in December 
2010.

Last year, Tracy Screen, 35, died after being overcome by carbon monoxide while camping.

It is thought the fumes drifted in from a barbecue outside her tent in Gyrn Goch, Caernarfon.

When the Jones family did not emerge 
from their tent on Sunday morning, a relative went in to find them all 
unconscious inside and ran to a nearby pub to call for help.

The disposable barbecue they used to cook the night before was in the porch of their tent, according to witnesses.

There has been a spate of similar 
tragedies recently, with campers overcome by fumes after using portable 
barbecues.

Carbon monoxide has no smell or taste but can kill quickly.

Mrs Jones is an account manager for an internet company, while her husband is thought to be a teacher.

Hannah lived with them and her brother in a terraced house in the Handforth area of Wilmslow, Cheshire.

The children’s natural father, Richard Thomas, was not available for comment yesterday at his home in Macclesfield, Cheshire.

The extended family who met for the holiday are thought to be consoling Mr and Mrs Jones at the hospital.

Neighbours said Hannah’s family 
enjoyed activity breaks. One said: ‘They are a lovely family – very 
active in all sorts of sports.

'I think both the children play football 
and the younger brother is a big Manchester United supporter.

'The family
are always going away on activity breaks.

'They love skiing and camping.
They are always driving off with the car packed with all the gear.’

Phil and Debra Wright, who own the Baron at Bucknell pub and its adjacent campsite, said the family was part of a larger group made up of the mother’s two sisters and their respective partners and children, staying in a number of tents on the site.

In a brief statement released through the hospital, the extended family said the incident had 'devastated' them and requested privacy to deal with the tragedy.

The statement said: 'Our priority as a family is to ensure that the three people in hospital get well and are fully recovered.

'We are devastated by this tragic accident and will release a full statement at a later date.

'We would ask that you respect our privacy at this time.'

As pictures of Hannah emerged last 
night, friends from Wilmslow High School said their class would ‘never 
be the same’ without her.

Hundreds of people joined a memorial page on 
Facebook.

Katy Walker wrote: ‘I’m gonna miss you so much Hannah.

‘You were such a beautiful girl both inside and out. You will always be in my heart and never be forgotten. Sleep well.’

Head teacher Gillian Bremner said the school would release a statement today after a staff meeting when teachers and pupils return from the Bank Holiday break.

At the campsite yesterday, three police officers could be seen collecting bags and clothes from the family’s tent.

Detective Inspector Gavin Kinrade for West Merica Police said: 'Although our work at the scene concluded yesterday afternoon, we will continue to work with the Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service to investigate this incident.

'We are treating the girl’s death as unexplained, but there do not appear to be any suspicious circumstances. It is therefore unlikely we will have any longer-term involvement with this incident.'
