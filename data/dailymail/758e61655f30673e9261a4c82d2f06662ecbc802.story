A shocking 40 percent of Americans will develop diabetes sometime in their lifetime, according to new estimates and it will jack up the price of already high healthcare costs, most of which will be paid for by the government

The recent study was conducted by Edward Gregg, chief of Edward Gregg chief of the epidemiology and statistics branch for diabetes research at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

As the lifespans for humans continue to increase so does the risk for type two diabetes, says the study published on August 13 online for The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology.

On the rise: At least 40 per cent of Americans will develop diabetes some time in their lifetime

'We weren't necessarily surprised that it increased, but we didn't expect it to increase this much,' Gregg said to CBS.

'Forty percent is a humbling number.'

The odds of those developing diabetes is even worse for certain minority groups.

Half of black women and of Hispanic men and women are predicted to contract type 2 diabetes during their lifetime.

The American Diabetes Association released research last year saying that the costs of those diagnosed with diabetes have risen to $245 billion in 2012 from $174 billion in 2007 when the cost was last calculated.

Of those with diabetes, 62.4 per cent are getting funding from Medicare, Medicaid, and the military.

Type 2 diabetes happens when the body does not produce enough insulin or is resistant to insulin, the hormone needed to take sugar and turn it into fuel for the cells in the brain and the body.

While many believe that obesity is the sole cause behind diabetes, genetics also play a role

There is no denying that diabetes type 2 and obesity go hand in hand, however.

Doctors have come up with the term 'diabesity' to exemplify the relationship between unhealthy habits and diabetes.

Since the 1980's, the risk of someone getting diabetes in their 20s increased from 27 percent to almost 40 percent.

Due to advancements in medical care and due to better treatment for diabetes, those with diabetes will live longer than ever before but it will take a toll on medical costs.

Health costs: Since more and more people are living longer with diabetes it will increase the cost of healthcare, most of which is government funded

'Even after people develop complications of diabetes that used to increase risk of death, there are so many ways to keep people alive longer these days,' Gregg said.

A doctor at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City Minisha Sood says, 'It's rending people incapable of enjoying a good quality of life. It's raising health care costs at an alarming rate. And frankly, there aren't enough health care professionals to deal with what's coming down the pike,' Sood said.

'We're looking at clogging up a health care system that's already stretched to its limits.'

There's no quick fix solution to the situation either.

'The thing that's going to have the biggest effect is if people with multiple risk factors can make sustained changes in their lifestyles,' Gregg said.

'Weight-loss surgery is an option for some and it is highly effective, but that's not going to be the solution for the large number of people at risk for diabetes.'
