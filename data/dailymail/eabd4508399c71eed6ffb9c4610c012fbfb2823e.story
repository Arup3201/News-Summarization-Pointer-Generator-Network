Several major fashion retailers have been busted for marketing their items as 'faux fur' when in fact they are crafted from real animal pelts.

In an investigation led by NBC's Rossen Reports, stores including Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom Rack Gilt Groupe and Belk were found to be selling mislabeled jackets, sweaters and boots from brands including Michael Kors, Aquatalia, Jacadi and Cluny.

Tests performed at the Microtrace Laboratory in Chicago proved that all four of the 'faux fur' items purchased and examined under the microscope contained real fur from coyotes, rabbits and raccoon dogs.

All the brands concerned issued statements in which they apologized for their actions and unanimously declared these hiccups were clerical errors rather than deliberate deceptions.

Nordstrom Rack pointed out that the Cluny 'faux fur-trimmed sweater' it sold had the correct 'real fur' label sewn in, but a website copywriter had wrongly described it as 'faux' on its site.

Gilt Groupe referred to the 'inaccurate description' of its Jacadi faux fur-trimmed jacket as 'a result of human error by a Gilt staffer.' The fur was in fact from a raccoon dog. Jacadi added that it would no longer be selling real fur after its Winter 2014 collection.

Neiman Marcus blamed its vendor Aquatalia for mislabeling a pair of 'faux fur-trimmed boots.' Aquatalia confirmed that 'a small quantity of rabbit fur boots were mislabeled' as a result of an 'inadvertent error.'

Belk admitted it had sold six Michael Kors coats which were labelled as 'faux' but were in fact made from real fur, again due to a 'clerical error.'

Pierre Gryzbowski, who runs the Humane Society of the United States' fur-free campaign, isn't convinced.

'Some of the good faux furs can be more expensive to use when making jackets or other garments than low-quality animal fur,' he explains. 'They may use animal fur just because it's cheaper.'

He added: 'It's outrageous. We're talking products made from animals who probably suffered, and certainly died, for a product that is not even what the customer wanted.'

U.S. animal advocacy nonprofit Born Free, states that more than 50 million animals are violently killed for use in fashion every year. 

According to the Fur Information Council of America however, the fur industry is entirely justifiable due to it being a 'historically significant' trade and 'a highly desirable consumer product.'

U.S. fur sales for 2013 were $1.39 billion – a ten per cent increase over the previous year. Still, according to a May 2014 Gallup poll, nearly 100 million Americans said they considered buying and wearing real fur to be 'morally wrong.'

NBC's latest expose is just the latest in a string of similar 'mislabeling' incidents regarding the sale of faux fur.

In September, Kohl's was found to be selling coats labelled as 'faux fur' but actually made from raccoon dog pelts. The retailer predictably apologized, blamed its vendor and stopped selling the coats.

And last year, the Federal Trade Commission charged Neiman Marcus with the same offense, after which Neiman Marcus settled and promised not to do so again.

In a statement to MailOnline, PETA said: 'Companies have a responsibility to ensure that they are not misleading customers who don’t want to support animals being bludgeoned, electrocuted, or skinned alive for their fur.

'PETA’s advice is that if there’s any doubt about whether a fur is really faux, it’s best just to avoid it altogether.'
