When the boss of a bedding business hired a van he didn’t realise it came with onboard help.

Steve Potter, 40, says he was in ‘utter disbelief’ after finding a 5ft snake in the vehicle outside his office.

It is thought that the North American red corn snake, which is not venomous despite its vivid markings, belonged to someone who had hired the van to move house.

Luckily the reptile, despite its distinctive colouring is not poisonous

‘It seems an odd thing to forget,’ said Mr Potter, 40, from Worsley in Greater Manchester. ‘You can leave a suitcase or some old bedding behind, but not a snake.’

He had a hard time convincing colleagues of his find until workmate Rachel Bettison had a look. ‘Most of the people in the building were alerted by her scream,’ said Mr Potter.

He returned the vehicle to Bury Van Hire, who called a reptile expert to catch the snake and are now trying to trace the owner.
