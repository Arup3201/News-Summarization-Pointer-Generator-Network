One-year on and Boston Strong is personified in this historic picture as the heroes of the marathon bombing come together for a moving portrait on Boylston Street.

Organized by the Boston Globe, which received a Pullitzer Prize on Monday for their coverage of the deadly terror attack, the photograph features a roll call of the major players from that April 15 afternoon.

Survivors, the police and firefighters who risked their lives to rush to the rescue, doctors, EMT's, runners, political figures and Red Sox players all stand proud for the inspiring and touching tribute.

Proud: More than a hundred people affected by the Boston Marathon bombing, including survivors, first responders, law enforcement personnel, local business affiliates, local professional athletes, and government officials, returned to the finish line on Boylston Street for a group portrait

Up front are the Richard family, who lost their little boy Martin, 8, to the second bomb as he watched the marathon with his dad, Bill, mother, Denise, sister Jane and brother Henry.

The family recently spoke of the trauma they have experienced this past year without Martin, as Denise also deals with the loss of her left eye, Jane the loss of her leg and Henry, who has suffered PTSD.

A symbol of bravery is at the front of the picture too - Carlos Arrendondo - now famous for his white cowboy attack and immortalized in a dramatic photo that day of him helping save Jeff Bauman, who suffered horrific injuries to his legs in the attack.

Standing tall in another cowboy hat is Red Sox player David Ortiz, who memorably unleashed a defiant swearing invective in front of the Fenway Park crowd days after the bombs - which was greeted only with the spirit in which it was meant.

CARLOS ARREDONDO (wearing white cowboy hat, front left)

In his native Costa Rica, Arredondo was a rodeo clown, helping get fallen riders out of the way of angry bulls.

'Years of doing that kind of adrenaline, you're rushing in and out, running up and out to get people out of there. ... In a way I was training myself for the Boston Marathon.'

He was passing out American flags on the race sidelines and ran to Jeff Bauman after the blasts and encountered him mortally wounded with both his legs blown off.

'I thought, `How am I going to get him out of here?''

'And then I saw this miracle woman coming with a wheelchair,' Arredondo recalled. 'And it saved his life.'

Jeff didn't pose for the picture, but over the past year the two men have come to symbolize everything about the terror and rescues of that day.

Bauman became one of the most recognizable and powerful symbols of Boston's resilience after the April 15 attacks - immortalized in an Associated Press photo that shows three rescuers - including Arredondo rushing him from the scene.

He became a hero days later when he was able to help authorities identify one of two brothers accused of setting off pressure cooker bombs, killing two women and an 8-year-old boy and injuring more than 260 others.

Bauman was standing near the finish line with two friends, waiting to cheer on Hurley as she completed the marathon, one of the most important and busiest events of the year in the city.

He noticed a man who looked out of place in a crowd of revelers, and they exchanged a long stare.

As Bauman describes him, he was 'all business.'

Moments later, the two bombs exploded. Bauman found himself on the ground, his legs gone.

People rushed in to help, but Bauman thought it was the end. Suddenly, a man in a cowboy hat appeared: Carlos Arredondo.

He lifted Bauman into a wheelchair pushed by Devin Wang, a Boston University student, and they rushed toward the medical tents. They were joined along the way by Paul Mitchell, an EMT with Boston EMS.

THE RICHARD FAMILY (wearing yellow t-shirts and brown jackets in the front of the picture)

To mark the year anniversary of their tragic loss, the Richard family opened up about the moment their lives changed forever.

In an emotional interview Bill Richard told the Boston Globe the moment the bomb went off and his son Martin died.

Emotional: From front, Jane, 7, Denise, (in hat), Henry and Bill Richards appeared in the photograph to mark the year anniversary of the bombings

He described the moment he saw his daughter Jane scream when she saw her left leg had been blown off and called out for her brother, who was already dead.

Bill, 43, refused to be operated on and spent 24 hours with shrapnel in his leg so he could make sure his family was OK.

In the chaos afterwards doctors tried to calm him down but he told them: ‘Relax? My son is dead. How can I relax?’

His wife, Denise, 43, a librarian, was left blind in her right eye.

Jane, seven, lost her left leg and Henry, 11, was physically unharmed but had deep psychological scars.

As Jane described it to doctors: ‘My brother Henry only got some cuts, but was hurt in his heart’.

CELESTE AND SYDNEY CORCORAN (far right, Celeste wears a fluorescent yellow coat and hat and Sydney wears a green parka jacket)

Mother
 and daughter Celeste, 48, and Sydney, 18, were on the finishing line 
cheering on Celeste's sister Carmen Accabo when the bombs went off.

Shrapnel
 tore through Sydney's thigh, severing a major artery and leaving her 
close to bleeding to death on the footpath. Her mother's injuries would 
leave her a double amputee.

The
 devastating emotional and physical repercussions of that day have 
shaped 2013 for the Corcoran family, as they will for the rest of their 
lives.

But their spirit
 is the epitome of the Boston Strong slogan, and Celeste and Sydney 
fought a thousand tiny battles after their horrific ordeal, and won.

'She's
 not just my mom, she's one of my best friends. We've always been 
really, really close but especially after such a horrific event, we just
 got so much closer,' Sydney told the Boston Globe.

'She's
 my mother so she's always taken care of me - I like to think I've 
always taken care of her too - but now even more so. I have to help her 
through the rest of her life.'

MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR DEVAL PATRICK (right, front in a baseball cap)

The governor was inspirational in the aftermath of the attacks and during the trying week that followed.

Indeed, he admitted over the summer that once Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been captured he went to a restaurant alone and got 'quite drunk' out of relief.

After a dinner of duck confit, french fries, soup, salad and chardonnay, Patrick said, 'I was actually quite drunk, by myself,' the Boston Herald reported in June.

FORMER MAYOR THOMAS MENINO (far left in brown jacket and blue shirt)

Another inspirational and strong figure for the city that difficult week, Menino has unfortunately been recently diagnosed with advanced stage cancer.

He is the longest serving mayor in Boston's history and only left office in January.

His strong leadership was a rock for the city during and after the attacks and when he left office he said, 'Thank you Boston. It has been the honor and thrill of a lifetime to be your Mayor. Be as good to each other as you have been to me.'

RED SOX HIITER DAVID ORTIZ (back left, also in white cowboy hat)

David Ortiz became a Boston hero for life when he took to the field at Fenway Park the week after the attacks and offered a resolute tribute to the city.

Designated hitter David Ortiz exclaimed 'this is our f***ing city' to rapturous cheers, and some tears, after a moving video, encapsulating the horror and heroism of the bombings.

'All right, Boston,' said Ortiz. 'This jersey that we wear today, it doesn't say Red Sox. It says Boston.

He continued: 'We want to thank you, Mayor Menino, Governor Patrick, the whole police department for the great job they did this past week. This is our f***ing city, and nobody is going to dictate our freedom. Stay strong.'
