Jeremy Paxman has hit out at 'morons' for leaving bags full of dog mess at a picturesque beach he was visiting.

The former Newsnight presenter, dubbed a 'rottweiler' for his interview techniques with politicians, found the bags of mess on the paths leading to an unnamed beach in Cornwall.

He even found some hanging in trees and piled up in car parks next to the beauty spot.

The 64-year-old, who quit Newsnight in June after 25 years, said that he had been to Amsterdam to take part in a television programme.

Writing in Waitrose Weekend magazine yesterday he said that he returned to England in time to join friends on a beautiful part of the Cornish coast.

'On the beach, dog owners had been asked to clear up after their dogs,' he said.

'A significant number of dog-owning morons had then deposited their plastic bags of dog**** alongside the path, in the car park, or hung them from trees.

'Left to the elements, the mess would have disappeared in a few weeks. 

'The plastic will be there for generations.

'What is going on in what passes for the minds of these people?'
