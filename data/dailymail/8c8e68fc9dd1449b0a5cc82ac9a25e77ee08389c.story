Authorities were evacuating numerous buildings Wednesday afternoon after several CSX tanker cars carrying crude oil derailed in downtown Lynchburg, Vriginia., and caught fire along the James River, city officials said.

The city of Lynchburg on its website posted that the fire department was on the scene and urged motorists and pedestrians to avoid the area.

It tweeted that the tanker cars were carrying crude oil and that three or four of them were breached. The city said 13 or 14 tanker cars were involved in the derailment.

No injuries were immediately reported, the city said.

Fiery: Authorities were evacuating numerous buildings Wednesday afternoon after several CSX tanker cars carrying crude oil derailed in downtown Lynchburg, Va., and caught fire along the James River, city officials said

City officials instructed motorists and pedestrians to stay away from downtown, while firefighters battled the blaze. Three railcars were still on fire as of 4 p.m

Witnesses say the smoke and fire were on a long stretch of the train tracks. The smaller fires died down pretty quickly

Photos and video show several black tanker cars derailed and extensive flames and smoke.

The city said on in a news release on its website that CSX officials were working to remove the portion of the train that is blocking workers from leaving Griffin Pipe Foundry located in the lower basin.

'We're used to kind of bangs and booms,' said Gerald McComas, a security officer at foundry up river from the derailment site. 'My first thought was it sounded like one of the guys started a motorcycle and then a realized, wait a minute, no ... that was more of a boom. We walked outside and there was the smoke rolling in.'

Concerns: Several trains carrying crude oil have derailed over the past year, prompting critics to question the safety of hauling explosive liquids by rail. Last July, a runaway train in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, derailed and exploded, killing 47 people

The fiery derailment occurred a short distance from office buildings in downtown Lynchburg, a city of 77,000

Safety first: Lynchburg's drinking water wasn't affected by the spill. But in Richmond, more than 100 miles downriver, authorities have begun drawing drinking water out of a separate canal rather than the James as a precautionary measure

Smoking: People look on as smoke rises after several CSX tanker cars carrying crude oil derailed on Wednesday in Lynchburg, Virginia

People in the general area have been evacuated, and the City of Lynchburg is asking people to avoid downtown

A portion of the train was blocking the road allowing workers at to leave their parking lot, McComas said. Instead workers were walking along the tracks to get to the other side of the train in order to leave their facility.

'I'm walking home tonight,' McComas joked.

A phone message left by The Associated Press with the Lynchburg Police Department wasn't immediately returned.

Gov. Terry McAuliffe said Deputy Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Adam Thiel was dispatched to the site to provide officials with updates on the situation.

Lynchburg is a city of about 77,000 people in the foothills of Blue Ridge Mountains. It is home to Liberty University and several others and is located about halfway between Baltimore and Charlotte, North Carolina.

Getting out:  Authorities evacuated numerous buildings Wednesday after the derailment

The CSX train was carrying between 12 and 14 CSX tanker cars when it derailed around 1:45 p.m.

Oil train accidents were the topic of National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Deborah Hersman last week at a two-day safety forum in Washington.

Hersman said the Obama administration needed to take steps immediately to protect the public from potentially catastrophic oil train accidents even if it means using emergency authority.

The Transportation Department was in the midst of drafting regulations to toughen standards for tank cars used to transport oil and ethanol, as well as other steps prevent or mitigate accidents. But there isn't time to wait for the cumbersome federal rulemaking process â€” which often takes many years to complete â€” to run its normal course, Hersman said.

'We are very clear that this issue needs to be acted on very quickly,' she told reporters at the conclusion of a two-day forum the board held on the rail transport of oil and ethanol. 'There is a very high risk here that hasn't been addressed.'
