Two men have been charged with the murders of a woman and her two daughters who mysteriously disappeared more than 40 years ago.

Vincent O'Dempsey, 76, and Gary Reginald DuBois, 67, appeared separately in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday charged with the murders of Barbara McCulkin, 34, and her daughters Vicki, 13, and Leanne, 11.

The three vanished on January 16, 1974 from their home in Highgate Hill, south of Brisbane, after two men were seen visiting the property. Their bodies have never been found.

Both men were charged with three counts each of murder, three counts each of deprivation of liberty and other serious offences, over one of Australia's most notorious unsolved killings.

Police say the two men have been charged with three counts of murder, three counts of deprivation of liberty and other serious offences

O'Dempsey's lawyer Terry O'Gorman told court he wanted to place on the record he'd told his client that because of the notoriety of the case, there was a risk someone in jail would come forward with false allegations that O'Dempsey had confessed to them.

'There is a very real risk that he'll be the subject of a jail `verbal' or a false allegation that in jail he confessed to a prisoner in relation to the subject matter of these charges,' Mr O'Gorman said.

'Mr O'Dempsey, on my advice, will not be discussing any aspect of this case with anyone whatsoever at the jail or the watchhouse.'

O'Dempsey was formerly charged with the murder in 1980, but the case was dropped due to insufficient evidence

Mr O'Gorman added that police were 'on notice' that if they encouraged any prisoner to talk with Mr O'Dempsey without the discussion being recorded, it would be an issue at trial.

DuBois' lawyer Peter Saggers said he echoed Mr O'Gorman's comments.

Magistrate Chris Callaghan noted that he had no jurisdiction to grant either man bail and adjourned both cases to November 24.

Both men were remanded in custody.

DuBois' daughter was in court to support her father and declined to speak with reporters.

Outside court, Mr O'Gorman said O'Dempsey would plead not guilty.

'I wish to make it clear on behalf of Mr O'Dempsey that what he's been saying since this cold case has been revived remains his case,' Mr O'Gorman told reporters.

'He is pleading not guilty. He declares his innocence of these charges.'

Mr O'Gorman said he wanted to make it clear to anyone in jail seeking to gain favour, for example a parole advantage, that his client would be keeping silent.

'This case has the profile that calls out for a jail 'verbal',' he said.

Ms McCulkin was the estranged wife of Billy McCulkin, a debt collector with underworld connections

He repeated his warning to police that it was 'on their head' if they encouraged a prisoner to talk to O'Dempsey without electronically recording the conversation.

He said he would apply for bail in the Supreme Court on behalf of O'Dempsey but it would take longer than normal because of the large body of evidence involved.

Mr Saggers said DuBois was in the same position and wouldn't be speaking to police or anyone else about the case.

'He denies the charge completely,' Mr Saggers said.

'He too will be making application for bail in the Supreme Court.'

Meanwhile, the brother of murder victim Barbara McCulkin has broken his silence and revealed his sister was 'shaking with fear' before she vanished.

Police charged two men, one of whose remote property was dug up earlier this year by cold case murder detectives, over one of Australia's most notorious unsolved killings.

The men, Vincent O'Dempsey and Gary Dubois have been charged over the murder of Mrs McCulkin and her two daughters Vicki and Leanne, who have not been seen since January 16, 1974.

In August, Police raided the rural property, which was an alpaca farm allegedly run by O'Dempseys as front for a marijuana operation

Graham Ogden, 77, told the Courier Mail he desperately wanted to find the bodies of his slain family members and honour them with a proper burial.

'What I’d like to know is where the remains are, get some sort of closure and have some burial perhaps. Even a few bones, a part of tissue, whatever it might be so we can give them some decent burial,' Mr Ogden said. 

He opened up about the last time the siblings talked, saying his sister appeared to be scared of what Mr McCulkin, Barbara's estranged husband, was up to.

O'Dempsey was a former associate of Billy McCulkin.

'I haven't seen her since, she was terrified, she was shaking with fear,' he told the Courier Mail. 

Mr Ogden admitted to a lot of lost sleep and anxiety over the four-decade long case.

'It’s very difficult to understand why it’s taken 40 years to get this far,' he said.

'There’s been lies, cover-up, lies, cover-up.'  

Warwick detectives allegedly found barrels filled with bags of cannabis, as well as a loaded gun and over $570,000 in cash 

After reopening the case in January this year - and after a murder charge in 1980 which was later dropped - detectives on Saturday charged O'Dempsey and Dubois with three counts of murder, three counts of deprivation of liberty and other serious offences. They will front Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday.  

Channel 9 footage showed 76-year-old O'Dempsey being driven into a Brisbane police station, where he was later formally charged.

Detective Superintendent Steve Holahan said: 'It's extremely pleasing, particularly for the investigators. It's been a very intense sand relentless investigation.' 

He added the arrests were the result of years of hard work by many investigators and specialist officers, particularly since the renewed investigation began in January. 

Since the case was reopened, police have spoken to a number of people in Queensland, leading to them a rural property in Warwick, which O'Dempsey was operating.

In August, police raided the rural property, which was an alpaca farm allegedly run by O'Dempseys as front for a marijuana operation.

Detectives from the Warwick Criminal Investigation Branch, Homicide Cold Case Unit and State Drug and Serious Crime Illicit Laboratories Investigation Team (ILIT) used an excavator to unearth a shipping container which they believe had been buried for years.

LIT members used breathing apparatus to examine the contents of the container. 

They allegedly found barrels filled with bags of cannabis, as well as a loaded gun and over $570,000 in cash reports Courier Mail. Thomas 'Teddy' Martin was charged with drug and weapons offences. He has no connection to the McCulkin murder case.

The McCulkin case has gripped Australia for over 40 years.

Mrs McCulkin was the estranged wife of Jimmy McCulkin, a debt collector with underworld connections.

Forty years after 13-year-old Vicky McCulkin (left) and 11-year-old Leanne (right) mysteriously disappeared, police have arrested Vincent O'Dempsey and Gary Dubois

On January 16, 1974, she  and her daughters Vicky and Leanne were at home in the Brisbane suburb of Highgate Hill.

It was school holidays, and the girls had returned from a birthday party.

One of the daughter's friends noticed two men visited the property at an unspecified time, and Mrs McCulkin and her two daughters vanished, never to be seen again.

O'Dempsey and Dubois were charged with the three murders in 1980 but the charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence.

Saturday's arrest of the two men who have long been the focus of the case is the most significant breakthrough since the former charges were dropped. 

 Detective Holahan said that the arrests 'reinforce that the Queensland Police and committed to solving serious crimes, regardless of when they were committed or where.' 

Police have yet to reveal a motive or where they believe the alleged murders took place, however Det. Holahan said 'the investigation looked at all different motives and movements of persons of interest.' 

A number of potential witnesses gave evidence at Crime and Corruption Commission hearings which looked into the case earlier this year.

'The renewed investigation and use of coercive powers has gathered significant evidence without which the arrests would not have been possible,' Det Supt Holahan said. 

'Todays arrest is extremely pleasing, but it's only the first in the prosecution stage,' he said.
