A Miley Cyrus fan has taken his obsession with the fan a little further than most by getting his body covered in tattoos of the pop singer.

After collecting photographs and watching interviews with her since 2009, Carl McCoid, 40, has had 22 portraits, lyrics and quotes from the star inked onto his arms, torso, hands, and leg.

Mr McCoid insists his obsession with 
the popstar did not contribute to the break up of his marriage in 2011 
but told the Sun his wife thought his interest in the Hannah Montana 
star was 'a bit weird'.

Tributes: Portrait: Mr McCoid, who runs an ironing business, said he watches all of her performances and interviews as well as having his arms, torso, back, hands and leg covered in tattoos of the star

The 21-year-old singer has heard about Carl but said his fixation with her made her feel 'creeped'.

Mr McCoid, who runs and ironing business in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, said: 'I think I need to go and see someone about it.'

Miley has her own collection of 
tattoos including her grandmother Loretta Finley's portrait tattooed on 
her arm, 'love' written on the inside of her ear, a heart, a cross and 
peace sign on her fingers and an equals sign signalling her support for 
gay marriage.

She got her first tattoo at just 17-years-old when she had the words 'Just Breathe' inked below her ribcage.

Miley also has a large dream catcher on her side, a skull on her ankle and the word 'karma' on one finger.
