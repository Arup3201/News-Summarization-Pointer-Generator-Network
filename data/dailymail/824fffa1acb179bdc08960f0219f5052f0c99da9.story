Watching a film or typing long emails in bed may sound appealing, but can get uncomfortable quite quickly.

Now there’s a new foldable desk that could make it easier for people to work from the comfort of their beds or sofas.

A laptop can be secured to the contraption, allowing it to be suspended upside-down above a person, while they lie on their back.

It comprises a black metal frame that can be bent into different shapes, a fan and straps to secure a computer so that it can be used upside-down.

The desk is designed to suit a worker’s needs, whether they are lying in bed, kneeling down, or sitting on the floor, for example.

Thanko says that it can be folded up into a small space when it is not being used and is easy to carry.

The ‘desk’ is meant to suit a worker’s needs, whether they are lying in bed, kneeling down, or sitting on the floor (pictured), for example. It is built to fit different sized computers as well as tablets and otherdevices

A built-in USB-powered fan is designed to cool the computer to prevent it overheating, which can be a problem with some lap tray designs.

Size: 23 x16 x 1.6inches (60 x 41 x 4cm).

Weight: 6.7lbs (2.8kg).

Weight capacity: The desk can support up to 132lbs (60kg).

Fits: Laptops up to 0.8 inches (2cm) thick.

Extra features: A USB-powered fan. 

It is available to buy via Japan Trend Shop for $120 (£79).

The desk, which arguably encourages laziness, bucks a recent trend for promoting exercise in the office.

Last year, Ikea revealed a £465 ($706) desk that's designed to be used standing up, with a mechanism that allows it to become a conventional desk at the touch of a button.

Experts say that changing from a seated to a standing desk can improve productivity and similar desks have become a common sight at tech firms such as Google, where some employees have even installed treadmill and bicycle desks.

The American Medical Association (AMA) says that sitting for extended periods of time can be bad for personal health, with global studies suggesting that we sit for an average of 7.7 hours a day, with some people remaining seated for 15 hours.

There are more active desks too. The BigRig mechanical desk generates electrical current as a worker pedals a bike-inspired mechanism to power gadgets, but it costs $2,400 (£1,467) because it is hand-crafted.

Designed by a start-up company called Pedal Power, the BigRig desk can be used to power computers, or can even be put to more domestic tasks, as well as boosting workers' fitness levels.

Standing desks have become commonplace across Silicon Valley, offering health benefits to those willing to work on their feet and last year Ikea launched a 'budget' version for £465 ($706).

The Bekant desk has a button that allows workers to change it back to the height of a standard desk, if they want a break.

Similarly, the $3,890 Stir Kinect desk has a motor to raise and lower itself, converting it into a standing desk or a traditional desk.

It can even be programmed to move up and down slightly, at the exact speed of a resting human heartbeat, making it to appear to take a gentle breath to remind the user to change their position.

Created by ex Apple and Disney engineers, the more expensive desk has a built-in touchscreen to control and track movement, and can tell users exactly how many calories they burn by standing for part of their working day.

‘Harvard Business Review called sitting ‘the smoking of our generation,’ said JP Labrosse, founder and CEO of Stir.

‘It’s also been shown that switching between sitting and standing can generate an extra fifty minutes of productivity each day,’ he claimed.
