Stevan Jovetic has complained that his reputation for being injured is unfair and partly puts it down to there being 'too much football in England'.

The Manchester City striker has made 22 Barclays Premier League appearances since joining for £22million in July 2013, and is currently the champions' only fit forward with Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko both out.

And Jovetic has hit back after manager Manuel Pellegrini warned the 25-year-old that he must prove he is no £22m dud.

History of injuries according to physioroom 

'I know people are saying that I am always injured, but when other players get injured the same as me, they don't get the reputation,' Jovetic told the Sunday Mirror.

'It has been hard for me in the last 18 months because I have had problems with injuries and my fitness. I would say that I have just been unlucky.

'It is also my opinion that there is too much football in England, especially over Christmas.

'The game here is quicker and much more physical than anywhere else in the world, so we are playing more matches at a more intense level.

'I would say that one game in England is the same as two games in Italy, in terms of the physical demands. It is that intense.'

Pellegrini's men face Sheffield Wednesday at the Etihad on Sunday, and Jovetic has let his fans know that there is more to come from him yet. 

'The City have not seen the best of me. Nowhere near. I just want to stay healthy now.'
