Italian striker Mirco Antenucci has joined Leeds for £1million from Ternana.

The 29-year-old had been at Elland Road for talks on Wednesday and tweeted a photograph of himself in front of the pitch as well as one of him signing his papers with the club's football consultant, Graham Bean.

'Proud to be a part of this club,' he wrote. 'I hope to give you a lot of satisfaction.'

Leeds then confirmed he had signed a two-year deal subject to international clearance.

Antenucci has done the rounds in Italian football, playing for the likes of Giulianova, Catania, Ascoli, Torino and Ternana, for whom he scored 19 goals last season.

His best return came in the 2009-10 campaign when he scored 24 times for Ascoli to win the Serie B golden boot.

He arrives at the Leeds the day after their 2-0 home defeat to Brighton - their second loss from three Championship games under new coach David Hockaday.

Antenucci's signing is Leeds' 11th of the summer and he becomes the fourth Italian purchased by owner Massimo Cellino.

The former Cagliari president said last week that he still hopes to sign a further five or six players and is understood to be pursuing a move for Adryan, the Brazilian playmaker on loan at his old club from Flamengo.
