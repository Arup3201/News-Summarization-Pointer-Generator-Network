American football star Mark Duper has been released from jail on bond after allegedly beating up his 17-year-old son in a domestic row.

The former Miami Dolphins player faces a felony child abuse charge after assaulting his teenage son and knocking him out during a series of fights at their Florida home.

The wide receiver, who starred for the Dolphins from 1982 to 1992, spent a night in jail after his arrest on Wednesday following the assault the day before.

Authorities say Duper attacked his son Marcus three times and knocked him out twice.

Duper has reportedly admitted there was an altercation but said he was acting in self-defense.

It was reported that the argument began with a row over a text Duper's son had sent to an ex-girlfriend.

During the row, Duper allegedly asked his son to pick a hat off the floor and punched him in the face when he 'wouldn't listen', according to the arrest report quoted in the Miami Herald.

The report claims Duper picked his son up and body-slammed him, knocking him unconscious.

The fight is then said to have calmed down before escalating again, with Duper allegedly 'hitting the child in the head and face with his fist'.

Later, the fight started up again when the boy is said to have dented his father's car with his bike, and Duper allegedly punched him in the face.

The Herald reports the police report: 'Once [the victim] went to the ground on his stomach, Mark climbed on top of [him], grabbed [him] by the neck and began choking.'

Duper was arrested on Wednesday after 
police were alerted to the boy's injuries, which included a cut lip, 
scratches, and a knot on his forehead.

He was questioned and spent a night in jail before being released on bond, and police notified the Department of Children and Families.

Duper, nicknamed Super Duper, played 11 seasons for the Dolphins, the best being 1984 and 1986.
