Forget hiring a tutor, there's a new way for pushy parents in China to boost their children's exam scores.

One county is offering high school students bonus points on their entrance exams if their parents donate at least four litres of blood.

Children of parents who donate this amount will receive a bonus point on their entrance exams to get into high school, or two points for six litres, and three points for eight litres.

A county in Zheijiang province in China has introduced a unique new incentive for blood donors: four litres of blood will earn a parent an extra point for their child in high school entrance exams (file picture)

Generous blood donors could also be rewarded with free medical care, free rides on public transport and cash rewards, according to the South China Morning Post.

The Pujiang county government, based in the eastern Zhejiang province, issued the new directive on July 24 this year as part of a drive to increase blood donation. 

One man, now 28, started donating blood at the age of 18 and announced he had finally met the four litre mark, winning his future child a bonus point in their exams.

'Because of this policy, I [donated so much blood that I] have put my life at risk! [I] want to tell my future son: No worries with the high school entrance exams, Dad has already got you bonus marks!' the man posted on Chinese blogging site Weibo.

The body contains about 5 to 5.6 litres of blood, depending on a person's weight.

It would take an adult five years to donate four litres if the person donated blood twice a year.

Blood donors must secure a certificate from the government before their children can be rewarded with extra points.

In another part of China, people who want to apply for a driving licence, receive their school graduation certificate, take up their first job, or get married in a registry offices are asked to give a voluntary donation as a contribution to society.

First year college students and soldiers are also urged to give blood at least once a year.

The new regulations city came into effect in Baoji city in the Shaanxi Province in north west China last week, Chinese TV reports. 

Both policies have been criticised on social media and blogging sites, by users who said they cheapen an act of charity.

'It's literally a bloody policy for extra marks,' wrote a Weibo user named 'daoluaimi'.

'It is not wrong to promote blood donation. But the method of exchanging blood for marks is too extreme,' another user said.
