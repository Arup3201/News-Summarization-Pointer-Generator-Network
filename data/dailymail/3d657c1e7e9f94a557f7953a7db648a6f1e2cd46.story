A baron's son who allegedly attacked 
his BBC  presenter wife during a row was pepper-sprayed as he fought 
with a policeman who was trying to arrest him, a court heard.

The Hon Edward Charles d’Olier Gibson 
is accused of punching an officer despite being sprayed twice in the 
face and struck repeatedly in the shins with a baton after resisting 
arrest for assaulting his wife.

Police were called to the former city 
financier’s £1million home after he allegedly dragged his wife of 12 
years, BBC World News presenter Tanya Beckett, by the hair as they rowed
 about whether they should get a divorce.

Gibson, 45, appeared at Oxford 
magistrates’ court yesterday charged with assaulting 47-year-old Mrs 
Beckett and PC Aaron Walker.

The Oxford-educated son of Edward Barry 
Greynville Gibson, 80, fourth Baron Ashbourne, denies both charges.

PC Walker told the court that Gibson 
had made him fear for his well-being after the father managed to throw 
him to the ground.

The officer said he was called to the five-bedroom 
detached home the couple shared near Watlington, Oxfordshire, in the 
early hours of  June 8.

Mrs Beckett had reported that Gibson 
had threatened her and grabbed her hair during a discussion about 
getting a divorce.

The officer said that the couple, who have three 
children, had been drinking heavily and that when he arrived, he 
discovered one of Gibson’s shotguns was unaccounted for.

The policeman told District Judge Tim Pattinson that this led to a search of the grounds of the home.

Then, at around 2.30am, the 
defendant’s car pulled into the driveway. PC Walker said Gibson ignored 
his instruction to stay put.

After he tried to restrain Gibson, the pair grappled for 11 minutes.

PC Walker, who said he weighs 
13-and-a-half stone, told the court that even though he handcuffed one 
of his hands, Gibson managed to throw him off as if he weighed 
‘nothing’.

He added: ‘At some point, he has taken
 a swing at me, which I moved to avoid. He said to me, “you’re not 
arresting me, I’m going home”.

‘I then reached for my capacitor 
(pepper spray) and sprayed it directly into Mr Gibson’s eyes. He stood 
there, wiped it from his eyes and called me a coward.

'That is the first 
time I have ever had a capacitor fail on me.’

The officer said he then drew his baton and hit Gibson as hard as he could, three times on his shins, which also had no effect.

He said: ‘This was an “Oh no” moment 
on my part, because I have never come across a person I have not been 
able to physically overpower.’

PC Walker then described being punched in
 the side by Gibson as he tried to grab him again.

The policeman claims 
Gibson then told him that he was ‘nobody and did not have the power to 
arrest somebody like him’.

The armed response unit had to be called as back up before Gibson was eventually taken into custody, the court heard.

Edmund Gritt, defending, suggested to 
PC Walker that his client had never said such words and the officer had 
failed to identify who he was. The officer denied this.

The trial was adjourned until later this month.
