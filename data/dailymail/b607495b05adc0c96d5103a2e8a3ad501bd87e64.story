Uncapped Alex Hales will finally be given a chance to stake his World Cup claim when he is named this week in England’s one-day squad to face India.

The 25-year-old opener has been in sensational form for Notts in recent weeks, hitting a breathtaking 141 from 96 balls against Middlesex last Thursday following a sublime ton for England Lions against Sri Lanka A at Taunton last week.

Hales has starred in 32 Twenty20 internationals but the selectors have been reluctant to employ his audacious strokeplay in the 50-over arena. 

Eyes on the prize: Hales will be called up to the ODI squad after some blistering T20 performances for England

PROBABLE: Cook (capt), Hales, Ballance, Root, Morgan, Bopara, Bell, Buttler (wkt), Stokes, Jordan, Woakes, Tredwell, Anderson, Finn

But that is set to change this week when he is widely expected to be named in a 14-man squad for a five-match series being viewed as an audition for next year’s World Cup.

‘I’m feeling in really good nick across all three formats,’ said Hales after his blistering hundred at Lord’s on Thursday.

‘When you come across patches like this you want to cash in whenever you can. All I can do is knock on the door with performances for Notts and the Lions. 

'My performances in T20 for England have been some of the best of my career so far,so hopefully if I do get thechance in one-dayers, I can take some of that experience in and build some big innings in that format as well.’

Middlesex fast bowler Steven Finn is expected to return for the series, beginning a week on Monday at Bristol. Jos Buttler will keep wicket, with the selectors undecided whether to retain the highly dependable James Tredwell ahead of Moeen Ali.

Stuart Broad’s imminent knee surgery will see him ruled out for between three and four months but he is expected to be fit for the World Cup.
