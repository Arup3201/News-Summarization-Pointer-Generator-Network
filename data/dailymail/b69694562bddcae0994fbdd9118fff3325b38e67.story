The parents of a 16-year-old boy have filed a $10 million lawsuit after a high-school English teacher allegedly plied their son with cannabis and repeatedly had sex with him in her office.

Married teacher Erin Sayar, 36, was meant to be tutoring Kevin Eng twice a week at James Madison High School in Brooklyn, New York - but their relationship quickly took a sexual turn.

The Eng family's lawyer, Bruce Baron, claims Sayar gave the youth pot from a stash she kept hidden in her office filing cabinet.

A report by school investigators found that Sayar, who has a young daughter, was found out last November when the boy's girlfriend saw them flirting and became suspicious.  

After hacking Eng's Facebook account, the girl found messages he had sent to Sayar which read, 'I love you so much' and 'I always loved you, since last year.'

Sayar had replied, writing, 'Oh no — I’m not putting myself out there again. I made that mistake last night and you couldn’t handle it.'

Despite this, the teacher gave the boy her mobile number and ordered him to delete their conversations.

Devastated, the girl informed school officials of the pair's exchanges, and confronted her boyfriend.

According to the school's report, Eng admitted having oral sex and intercourse with Sayar between eight to 12 times.

The New York Post reports that the lovers exchanged an incredible 3,856 text messages over a 17-day period in December, an average of 227 per day.

One midnight tryst apparently saw Sayar pick the boy up from his house in her car.

'Eventually, they began kissing and then engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex inside the SUV,' the report said, adding that the boy had described tattoos on intimate parts of Sayar’s body.

A spokesman for the Department of Education said Sayar, who earns just over $78,000 (£50,000) a year, is still technically employed at the school, although she was removed from the classroom in January.

The school investigators have submitted their report to Brooklyn's District Attorney Charles Hynes, strongly recommending she be fired.

Eng, who is now 17, is still a pupil at the school.

The sordid allegations are not the first to hit James Madison High School, christened 'Horndog High' after its past sex scandals.

Language teachers Cindy Mauro and Alini Brito were dismissed from their posts after an alleged lesbian romp in a school classroom in November 2009 - a claim they both denied.

Prior to that, 29-year-old English teacher Craig Roffman was sacked and arrested in 2005 after he was found emailing child pornography.
