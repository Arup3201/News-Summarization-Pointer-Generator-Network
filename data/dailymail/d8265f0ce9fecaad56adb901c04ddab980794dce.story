Remember fashion plates? They were the toy that every little girl wanted, letting them create their own clothing designs by rubbing black crayon over small plastic templates.

But this toy from Crayola takes custom fashion for kids - and adults - to a new level.

Named My Virtual Fashion Show, the kit allows children to design outfits in a colouring book and then see their creations virtually modelled on an iOS device.

It works by using special corner markers on every page of allowing an app to take a picture at exactly the right place.

The app then extracts the designs onto an iPhone or iOS tablet and transforms it into a 3D model.

And staying without the lines of the twenty page book isn’t vital, as the app will automatically crop out what isn't needed.

The children can then watch cartoon models strut their stuff on a virtual catwalk as their designs come to life.

For $45 (£27) the book lets kids create ten different designs, allowing them to colour in both the front and the back of the outfit.

‘We know kids love fashion and design so giving them a way to express their unique style both offline and online seemed like a perfect fit,’ said Kip Olmstead, executive Vice President of Global Product Development at Crayola.

‘My Virtual Fashion Show is the first and only product of its kind that allows a seamless transition between their real life fashion creations and the virtual experience and we are so excited for it to help kids everywhere unleash their original vision.’

The kit contains a fashion portfolio, 20-page fashion sketchbook, 12 short coloured pencils, and My Virtual Fashion Show app.

With all this technology at their fingertips, the kit could help inspire the next Stella McCartney.
