Tourists on a Jet2.com flight from Malaga refused to fly home after a suspicious passenger started taking photos of the plane and cabin crew. 

The flight was left stranded on the runway for more than two hours after the passenger was led off in handcuffs and questioned by Spanish police.

A total of 36 passengers abandoned the flight when the man was later allowed back on board.

Tense atmosphere: Passengers on the Jet2.com flight from Malaga panicked when a man started acting suspiciously, taking photos of the cabin crew and the plane

Some passengers claimed air stewardesses were crying and one asked who would look after her children if anything happened.

Nick Taylor, 40, from Blackburn, Lancashire, left the plane with his wife and son and paid £1,000 for new flights home. 

He said: 'I had to make a decision, do I risk my family for the sake of £1,000?

'The air hostesses were crying and there was a scuffle at the front of the plane. There was a very tense atmosphere.

'If they'd given us any reassurance or explanation it would have calmed the situation but it got to the point where there could have been a riot.'

MailOnline has discovered that some flight passengers have been forced to remain in Malaga, forking out for their own accommodation as they were unable to book flights until Saturday.

A beauty therapist who was among the passengers had to warn her clients she would not be in the salon because of what she described on Facebook as a ‘horrendous incident’.

The 'agitated' passenger launched into a series of bizarre antics when his request to see the cockpit was rejected.

The man, described as in his early 30s and of African descent, took pictures of the plane and cabin crew before taking a selfie and snapping his phone's SIM card and throwing it down a toilet.

'The air hostesses were crying and there was a scuffle at the front of the plane', said passenger Nick Taylor who left the plane with his wife and son 

The man was eventually allowed to return to his seat and the flight landed in Manchester two hours later than scheduled

Airport staff and Spanish police carried out security checks before eventually letting the man return to his seat.

Another passenger, who asked not to be named, said: 'As soon as the man got back on the plane the captain ordered for the door to be shut and began making the usual announcements without consulting his staff or passengers.

'A stewardess knocked on the cockpit door and returned saying if she got off the plane she'd be sacked. She said she told head office they should look after her kids if anything happened.'

The flight landed in Manchester at 3.45pm - around two hours later than scheduled.

The 36 passengers were told to make their own arrangements to get home and were later booked on a flight to Leeds and transferred via minibus.

A Jet2.com spokesman said: 'A number of our passengers chose not to travel because they weren't happy travelling with a fellow passenger, despite that person clearing all required security checks.'
