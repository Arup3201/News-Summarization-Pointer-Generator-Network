Spanish part-timers Cornella can look forward to a visit to the Bernabeu in December but it will be strictly tourism in the capital after Real Madrid all but confirmed their passage into the Copa del Rey quarter-finals with a convincing win in Wednesday night’s first leg.

Cornella’s 27-year-old journeyman centre forward Oscar Munoz, whose career has taken him to 14 clubs, scored a memorable first-half goal but it was not enough to keep the tie alive.

Third-tier side Cornella – led by captain and dentist David Garcia – gave a good account of themselves in the first half but conceded twice from corners scored by Real’s France centre back Rafael Varane and were taken apart in the second half as the Cup holders got into their stride.

UD Cornella: Manuel, Marin, Marti, Pelegri (Tapia 57), Tobella, Garcia, Gomez, Plazuelo (Gallar 58), Caballe, Xemi (Gaudioso 72), Munoz.

Subs not used: Alberto, Boniquet.

Goal: Munoz 20 

Real Madrid: Navas, Arbeloa, Varane, Nacho, Carvajal, Khedira, Illarramendi, Isco (Tomas 77), Rodriguez (Marcelo 61), Hernandez, Benzema (Medran 77).

Subs not used: Pacheco, Romero.

Goals: Varane 10, 36, Hernandez 53, Marcelo 75

That will not take the shine off the second leg but it will be a night for swapping shirts and taking in the sights as opposed to repeating the heroics of third division side Alcorcon in the 2009 season, who they knocked Manuel Pellegrini’s Real Madrid out of the competition at this stage. Real never looked in trouble here.

They scored on 10 minutes when a corner from James Rodriguez was headed in by Varane. Cornella were on level terms 10 minutes later when Muñoz took advantage of indecision in the Madrid defence to beat Keylor Navas for the equaliser. But the dream died on 36 minutes when Varane got on the end of another corner, this time from Isco, to head Madrid in front.

In the second half Javier Hernandez scored Madrid’s third with a cross shot leaving Jose Segovia in the minnows’ goal helpless.

Playing at Espanyol’s stadium because their own ground holds only 1,500 fans, Cornella had effectively lost home advantage and although Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti left Cristiano Ronaldo resting back in the capital along with Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric there was still enough talent on display to see off Cornella with Rodriguez controlling things in midfield.

Hernandez could and should have got the fourth from Isco’s pass but couldn’t reach the midfielder’s pass at the back post.

Marcelo came on as a second half substitute in place of Rodriguez and with a licence to play further forward took full advantage by getting on the scoresheet to make it 4-1. Isco’s shot was saved by Segovia and Marcelo fired the rebound into the roof of the keeper’s net. There were somersaults in his celebration for his 20th career goal for Madrid.

The rest of Spain’s last-16 cup games will be played in December but with Madrid off to compete in the World Club Cup later that month they have been given special dispensation to play their first leg early. 

Sevilla, who they will play in a rearranged league match when the rest of Spain plays its first leg ties, were also allowed to bring forward their match.
