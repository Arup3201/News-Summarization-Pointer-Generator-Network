Filter: New BT customers will have to actively chose whether to have Parental Control filters when they subscribe to the company's broadband service (library image)

BT has announced all new customers will have parental control filters switched on when they subscribe to its broadband service.

The company has offered the free Parental Controls service for a number of years, but this is the first time new customers will have to actively choose whether to turn the filters off.

During the set-up process, a box that turns on the controls - which block a number of sites including pornography, those containing self-harm and violence as well as hate sites - will be automatically ticked.

Subscribers will then have to actively turn the blocks off and instead decide what level of protection - if any - they require.

The company will also extend its filter service to all internet devices including games consoles and tablets. Previously parents could only block potentially harmful sites on desktops and laptops.

BT will also be contacting all of its existing customers from the start of next year, forcing them to make a choice about the level of controls on their broadband.

There will be three set filter levels – strict, moderate and light - which can be customised to suit each individual family’s needs.

Additional websites can be added to the list to be allowed or blocked. The filter can be turned off at specific times - acting like a 'watershed'.

The account holder’s credentials are required to set up and change any of the settings as to avoid young people simply turning the service off.

Every change results in a confirmation email being sent to the adult account holder, also.

Pete Oliver, MD Consumer Commercial Marketing and Digital, said: 'BT takes the issue of online child protection extremely seriously and we are very pleased to be able to launch the whole-home filter to help parents keep their families safe online.

'It adds to the many tools we already make available for free to our customers.'

Changes: As well as laptops and desktop machines, BT's filters will protect children on tablets and games consoles

In November, it was announced that all 20million families with an internet connection would be forced to say whether they wanted access to online pornography among dangerous sites within a matter of months.

BT joins other providers TalkTalk and Sky who make all new customers make a choice on whether the filters should be switched on or off when they sign up.

The Daily Mail has campaigned to make family-friendly filters ‘default on’ to help protect a children.

There has been growing alarm at evidence that a third of youngsters have accessed online pornography by the time they are ten years old.

Six in ten parents say they are worried or very worried about their sons and daughters seeing violent and sexual material on the web.
