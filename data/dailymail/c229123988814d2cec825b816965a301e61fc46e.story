Acquitted: A jury took less than three hours to find Annie Merrilees not guilty of murdering her boyfriend

A former Harrods shop assistant who stabbed her boyfriend has been cleared of murder after telling jurors he was a violent cocaine user who had beaten her for three years.

Annie Merrilees, 25, said nightclub bouncer Dean Williamson punched her in the face and banged her head against a gas boiler on the day she stabbed him in the heart.

Jurors at the Old Bailey took less than three hours to find her not guilty of murder and manslaughter after she told them she grabbed the knife in self-defence in their shared flat.

The mother-of-two sobbed as she told the trial: ‘I never intended to kill him.

‘I was upset about what he did to me but I loved him. He loved me too.’

Ms Merrilees’ relatives wept tears of joy as she was cleared today. Dressed in a black floral top and black trousers, she mouthed ‘thank you’ at the jurors before she was released from the dock.

Judge Christopher Moss QC told her: ‘You are free to go’. 

Police found Mr Williamson, 31, dying on December 17 last year at the flat the couple shared in Chadwell Heath, Essex.

The trial heard the couple had both been drinking. When police spoke to Ms Merrilees she initially tried to claim her partner turned the knife on himself.

But she later changed her story in a prepared statement through her solicitor, admitting she had stabbed her boyfriend but insisting it was in self-defence. 

Prosecutor Peter Finnegan conceded Mr Williamson was ‘a man with a history’ and was a heavy drinker and cocaine user.

But he told the jury Ms Merrilees was also a drug-taker who was ‘in the habit of getting involved in abusive slanging matches’ with her partner.

‘It was not just a one way street - it was both of them,’ Mr Finnegan added. ‘Some of the neighbours would say she was rather worse than he was'.

Ms Merrilees, however, said she had been repeatedly assaulted by Mr Williamson during their three-year relationship.

Prosecutors said Ms Merrilees (left) also got involved in 'slanging matches' but she said: ‘I believed I was going to be violently assaulted. I picked up a knife because I was in fear for my safety. I wanted Dean (right) to leave'

She said Mr Williamson had grabbed her by the throat, pulled her by the hair, punched her in the face and even attacked her when she was almost eight months pregnant.

‘I didn’t leave because I always hoped that he would get better,' she told the court. 'I loved him'.

She said she was attacked on the day of the incident, leaving her with bruises to her head and face.

That night he forced his way into the flat, she said, and refused to leave.

‘He became very aggressive,' she said. 'I was extremely concerned for my safety.

‘I believed I was going to be violently assaulted. I picked up a knife because I was in fear for my safety. I wanted Dean to leave.' 

After the stabbing, she said: ‘He just went silent. I went into the living room and sat on the sofa.

‘He sat down. Then all of a sudden he dropped on the floor. That’s when I knew it was really serious.

‘As he was on the floor I was screaming.’

Mr Williamson had criminal convictions and had previously been a suspect in an armed robbery, but the case was dropped, the court heard.

Katie O’Brien, a friend of the couple who returned to the flat with them on the night of the stabbing, said they had been arguing violently and at one stage Mr Williamson had his hands around his girlfriend's throat. 

Ms O’Brien said she went into the bathroom and did not see the stabbing itself.

She then saw the bouncer 'stagger into the living room and then he fell on the couch holding his left chest,’ said Mr Finnegan.

Mr Williamson gasped: ‘Stabbed, Kate. Stabbed’.

He died a day after he was airlifted to hospital for open heart surgery.

Ms Merrilees told the jury: ‘I accept I caused the injury to Dean Williamson. At all times I was in fear that I would be seriously injured by him.

‘I didn’t want him to kill me.

‘At no point was it my intention to kill Dean Williamson.'
