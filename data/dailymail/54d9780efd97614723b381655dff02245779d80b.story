Rapper Snoop Dogg has been revealed as the most prolific celebrity user of photo sharing app Instagram. 

According to data compiled by addiction website Addiction-Treatment.com, the 43-year-old has posted more images than any other famous person currently using the app, including selfie queens Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton. 

But Snoop - whose real name is Cordozar Broadus, Jr. - was also revealed to have posted more references to drugs and alcohol than any other celebrity, with fellow rapper P. Diddy coming a close second.

Raise your glass! P. Diddy was also featured in the top five most active Instagram users, as well as being named as one of the top celebrities most likely to post about drink or drugs

Number one: Addiction-Treatment.com compiled a list of the most active celebrity Instagram users

The date, which was compiled in September 2014, shows that Snoop had posted a total of 686 images which contained a reference to illegal substances or drink - making up just over seven per cent of his Instagram activity - while P. Diddy, whose ream name is Sean Combs, had posted 347.

Indeed, it seems rappers in general have a particular fondness for the photo sharing; of the 40 celebrities included on the list of most active users, a whopping 27 were rappers, while just six actors or actresses, four models and three comedians were also included. 

But when ranked according to number of illicit images shared on the site, rappers, including Nicki Minaj and Drake, made up the top 15 spots on the list. 

Setting an example for his fellow rappers however, is Jay-Z, who has posted just one image which contained  

Surprisingly, the Kardashian clan, who are renowned for their seemingly-constant Instagram updates, featured fairly far down on the list, with Khloe, Kim and their younger sister Kendall Jenner placing ninth, tenth and eleventh respectively.

But when it came to the more illicit Instagram updates, the reality stars will no doubt be happy to hear that they fell even further down the list. 

According to Addiction Treatment, both Kim and Khloe have posted a total of 21 photos which contained references to drugs or alcohol, while Kendall - who is only 19 and therefore not yet legal to drink in the United States - has posted ten.

The data does show that the number of celebrities posting images which contain references to drugs - and the frequency with which they have posted them - has decreased significantly since 2011, when the site became available to all members of the public.

However the number of images containing references to alcohol has increased substantially.  

'We can see the growth and decline of celebrity Instagram shares of drugs and alcohol images each month since 2011,' the website states.

'It’s clear that sharing drugs has decreased significantly as the social media platform has become more prominent, but sharing alcohol posts has risen as the site’s popularity has surged.'

The website also questions whether celebrities' eagerness to post such mature content is having a direct impact on the number of their fans who turn to drinking and drug use in an attempt to follow in their famous idols' footsteps.

'As Instagram has grown more popular, so has its popularity with celebrities, some of whom use social media to candidly and directly interact with fans,' the website explains. 

'When drug use comes into the equation, we have to wonder what kind of message is being sent. Are celebrities promoting drug and alcohol abuse? If Snoop’s lighting up right now, why don’t I?'
