We will still never know whether Geoff Hurst's shot in 1966 did bounce down over the line.

But such high-profile controversies will soon be confined to the past after it was revealed that goal-line technology is one step closer to being introduced to top-level football.

The Hawkeye system will be used at Wembley for England's friendly against Belgium on June 2 - Roy Hodgson's first home game in charge of the national team.

The move comes after a season of controversial decisions that have seen goals awarded when replays show the ball did not cross the line - and not given when they clearly have.

Over the line? If goal-line technology had been in place Frank Lampard's goal against Germany in the last World Cup would have stood

In Chelsea's FA Cup semi-final win over Tottenham last month, Juan Mata was awarded a goal even though the whole of the ball was not over the line.

While in Scotland, Hibernian's Paul Hanlon 'scored' against Dunfermline even though his shot clearly bounced down off the crossbar half a foot in front of the goal line.

Conversely, in the Premier League this season QPR defender Clint Hill was denied a goal after his header went over the line at Bolton.

Calls for goal-line technology have grown louder in recent years after a string of high-profile errors.

In the 2010 World Cup match between England and Germany, Frank Lampard was denied a valid goal after his shot came back off the bar and over the line. The goal would have made it 2-2, and England went on to lose 4-1.

However, if there are any close calls during next weekend's game only the scientists monitoring the system will know the results - the referee will not be informed.

Testing: Hawk-Eye made its live match debut in the Hampshire FA Senior Cup final at Southampton's St Mary's Stadium on May 16

It will be the final live test for the Hawkeye system and follows a previous test during the Hampshire FA Senior Cup final at Southampton's St Mary's Stadium on May 16.

It works by using seven cameras pointed at each goalmouth. If the ball crosses the line, a radio signal is sent to the referee’s wristwatch.

It is believed the technology would cost around £250,000 to install at each stadium.

Those examining the new system will be keen to see how it copes with a higher roof, electronic advertising hoardings and a much larger crowd.

Another system, called GoalRef, is being tested in the Danish Super League.

All the tests are being monitored by officials from EMPA, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology.

A vote on whether to allow the technology to be rolled out across all matches will be held at a special meeting of the International Football Association Board on July 2 in Kiev.

If it goes ahead it could be in place for Premier League matches next season.

The latest move comes two years after Frank Lampard was denied a 'goal' during England's Second Round World Cup game against Germany in South Africa and brought the debate to the top of the agenda.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter wants to ban penalties

FIFA President Sepp Blatter has asked German great Franz Beckenbauer to find an alternative to the 'tragedy' of penalty shootouts.

Blatter told the FIFA Congress on Friday that football 'loses its essence' when matches are settled by penalty kicks.

Football 'can be a drama, even a tragedy, when we go to penalty kicks,' Blatter said.

'Football should not go to one to one, because when football goes to penalty kicks, it loses its essence as a team sport.'

Chelsea beat Bayern Munich in a shootout last weekend to win the Champions League after the German side had dominated a game that finished in a 1-1 draw after extra time.

Beckenbauer, the former Bayern captain and president, heads FIFA's Task Force Football 2014 panel which Blatter created in 2010 to improve football before the next World Cup in Brazil.

'Perhaps Franz Beckenbauer with his Football 2014 group can present us with a solution, if not today then tomorrow.'

The task force has met several teams, but has shown little public interest in scrapping penalty shootouts.

FIFA said in a statement: 'Such tests could lead to the International Football Association Board (IFAB) approving the introduction of GLT at its special meeting at the beginning of July.

'Only the EMPA observers, IFAB and FIFA representatives at Wembley will have access to the GLT system readings.

'Therefore, should a goal-line incident occur at this or any of the 'test' matches, the system will not be utilised by the match officials. It means the GLT system will have no influence on the outcome of the matches in which the system is being tested.

'FIFA would like to place on record its sincere thanks to the Football Association for their willingness to support the live match tests, a critical part of Test Phase 2 for goal-line technology.'

FA general secretary Alex Horne said: 'We remain committed to the introduction of goal-line technology on the basis that it is accurate. We are in an intensive phase of testing and are delighted we can help FIFA by using our stadium at Wembley.

'We look forward to considering the results at the next meeting of IFAB.'

Geoff Hurst, England v West Germany, 1966The most famous goal-line controversy of them all. It was extra-time in the World Cup final at Wembley with the scores level at 2-2 when Hurst turned and fired in a shot, which hit the bottom of the crossbar and bounced down toward the line. With referee Gottfried Dienst uncertain, linesman Tofik Bahramov from Azerbaijan signalled a goal. Hurst went on to complete his hat-trick, England won the World Cup and the debate over the decision has never stopped.

Frank Lampard, England v Germany, 2010England trailed 2-1 in their World Cup second-round match when Lampard's 20-yard shot beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, hit the underside of the bar and bounced clearly over the line. The goal was not given, though, and Germany went on to claim a comprehensive 4-1 victory to knock England out of the tournament.

Pedro Mendes, Manchester United v Tottenham, 2005There was just a minute to go at Old Trafford when Mendes tried to beat Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll with an audacious lob from just inside the opposition half. The effort should not have troubled the Northern Irishman, but he spilled the ball over the line before diving to scoop it out. Despite the ball dropping two yards over the line, the goal was not given and the match ended 0-0.

Luis Garcia, Liverpool v Chelsea, 2005In a Champions League semi-final, Liverpool's Luis Garcia sent his side through when his hooked effort was awarded by referee Lubos Michel, despite Chelsea defender William Gallas claiming he had cleared it from under the bar. Liverpool progressed to win the final, with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho left to say: 'It was a goal from the moon or the Anfield Road stand, I don't know where.'

Clint Hill, Bolton v QPR, 2012In a battle between two struggling sides, Clint Hill thought he had given QPR the lead when he headed a Joey Barton cross in. Goalkeeper Adam Bogdan scrambled behind his line to save and, although replays showed Hill had scored, linesman Bob Pollock assured referee Martin Atkinson he had not and Bolton went on to win.

Juan Mata, Tottenham v Chelsea, 2012Chelsea hammered their London rivals 5-1 in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley, but they were helped on their way by a Juan Mata goal which did not cross the line. The Spaniard put the Blues two up when referee Martin Atkinson awarded a goal even though replays showed his shot was blocked on the line.

Jonathan Howard v Middlesbrough, 1997Premier League Middlesbrough, boasting a line-up of internationals, were down to ten men and trailing 2-1 to Second Division Chesterfield in the FA Cup semi-final when Howard's close-range shot came crashing down off the crossbar and over the line. The goal would have put the game beyond Middlesbrough. But it wasn't given, the game ended 3-3 after extra time and Boro went on to win the replay 3-0.
