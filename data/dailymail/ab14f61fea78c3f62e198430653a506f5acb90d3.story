Residents living in a block of flats where a mother of two was beheaded have described how they heard bloodcurdling screams before police discovered her body.

Judith Nibbs – who cared for the elderly and vulnerable – was found dead on Friday after an alleged row with her estranged husband.

Detectives were greeted by horrific scenes when they arrived in the blood-spattered flat, situated near the million-pound homes of the trendy Shoreditch area of London.

Victim: The headless body of Judith Nibbs was today discovered at her home near Old Street, in Shoreditch, London

They found the 60-year-old's dismembered body, while her estranged husband Dempsey Nibbs, 67, had apparently turned the knife on himself causing serious injuries.

He is still in a critical condition after being taken to hospital at 5am on Friday. Police are waiting to question him over the death.

Afzal Zahar, 32, who lived above Mrs Nibbs, told The Sunday People: 'My wife heard screaming and banging from downstairs.The police came soon after.'

Mrs Nibbs, who lived on the Charles Square Estate, had worked for Hackney Borough Council for six years providing meals on wheels for the elderly, in addition to caring for her disabled daughter.

Yesterday, her daughter Lauren left a heartbreaking message on Twitter which simply read: 'Mum?'

Tributes were laid at the flat with one saying: 'Judith, can't believe we are not going to see you or that smiling face and your laugh again. We are all going to miss you. Love and kisses, Meals on Wheels.'

Dean Cummings, 28, who has lived on the estate since he was born, said: ‘I’ve known her all my life. She was a nice lady and didn’t have a bad word to say about anybody.

‘She was always happy with a smile on her face. She had a disabled daughter and an older son who’s about 25.

‘She worked for her kids. The daughter’s in a home. Who’s going to bankroll that now? It’s just so sad. I’ve never seen her with a partner.’

Crime scene: Detectives who were called to the flat were confronted with horrific scenes, with blood splattered across the property

Horror: Ms Nibbs, 60, was found decapitated inside the home she once shared with her estranged husband Dempsey Nibbs. He was found to have turned the knife on himself causing himself serious injuries

Suspect: Mr Nibbs, 67, is in a critical condition in hospital. Police officers are waiting to question him in connection with the horrific murder

Andrew Pemberton, 42, who lives in the same block as the low rise apartment block, said: ‘I think she worked for Hackney Council meals on wheels. I used to see her going to work in a high-visibility vest.

‘It’s just terrible on your own doorstep. She has a son and a daughter but didn’t have a partner as far as I knew.’ Detectives were today seen searching bins surrounding her ground floor flat looking for the weapon.

Investigation: A police spokesman said detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident

One man, who lives next door to the woman and her 29-year-old son, said he was woken by police shouting.

The 27-year-old man who wanted only to be known as Cihan, said: ‘They were banging on my door and jumping on the bins to get over the back garden.

‘They just said a “serious incident” was going on. She kept herself to herself and hardly seemed to go out.’ No arrests have been made, but police said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.

Next of kin have been informed, but the woman has not been formally identified.

A post-mortem examination is expected to take place early next week.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A murder investigation has been launched in Hackney.

‘Police were called by paramedics at around 5am to Charles Square Estate following concerns for the welfare of a resident.

‘Officers attended and found a 60-year-old woman deceased at the location.

‘Formal identification is yet to take place. Next of kin have been informed. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course.

‘A 67-year-old man was taken by ambulance to an east London hospital where he remains in a critical condition.

‘There have been no arrests. Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.’

Cordon: Police officers erected a cordon around Vince Court in Brunswick Place, Old Street where the headless body of Judith Nibbs was discovered. Forensic officers scoured the scene for evidence
