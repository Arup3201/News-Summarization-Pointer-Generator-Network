Two former lovers who each murdered children in separate slayings are back in contact and writing love letters to each other from behind bars, it has been revealed.

Wesley Williams strangled his former partner and her seven-month-old baby after the graduate broke up with him – then wrote about his crimes on Facebook.

At the time of his sickening attack, in June, his ex partner Rebecca Shuttleworth was also facing trial for the murder of her two-year-old son Keanu.

It has today been revealed that the couple are still 'obsessed' with each other and are penning love notes from their prison cells.

The Sun reports that friends of Williams said he knew Shuttleworth had 'always been the one for him' since they met as youngsters in children's homes.

Williams was ordered to serve a minimum of 29 years of a life sentence for the ‘chilling, casual and calculated’ killings of Yvonne Walsh and her son Harrison.

Described by a judge yesterday as ‘clearly evil’, Williams posted a message on the social networking site after he carried out the double murder saying: ‘Sometimes we just have to do things we shouldn’t.’

He also wrote ‘I am sorry it had to come to this’ on his victim’s Facebook page, and changed his relationship status  to ‘single’.

Mr Justice MacDuff branded the 29-year-old as a man ‘dangerous beyond measure’ who had ‘executed’ a defenceless infant and his mother. He then ordered guards to ‘take this evil man down’.

Prosecutors said the pair’s relationship crumbled after 25-year- old Miss Walsh spurned Williams’s proposal of marriage.

He had been released from prison on licence four months before the murders after serving a five-year term for attacking his sister’s ex-partner with a hammer. But the licence had expired by the time he killed the mother and son.

Williams pleaded guilty last week at Birmingham Crown Court to murdering the pair.

After his sentencing yesterday, reporting restrictions barring any mention of his link with his former girlfriend who murdered her two-year-old son were lifted.

Rebecca Shuttleworth, 25, was jailed for life in June at the same court after battering to death her son Keanu Williams, under the noses of Birmingham social workers.

Keanu Williams, whose body showed 37 external marks of injury, was found dead in January 2011

She had given the child her then boyfriend’s surname even though he was not the biological father.

Yesterday the court heard how Miss Walsh, a care home manager, was found dead in her bed at Billesley, two days after she was last seen alive.

Her son’s body was found in his cot beside her. Pathologists were unable to determine who was killed first.

The social care graduate’s relationship with Williams began two months before she died on May 31.

She was last known to be alive at 8.10pm that evening – but by 8.54pm Williams was posting on Facebook. By then, police believe the mother and son were dead.

Friends told police unemployed Williams was ‘joking, laughing  and smiling’ later that evening  as he played computer games.

He was also caught on CCTV doing ‘high-fives’ with a friend in a fast-food outlet and boasted on Facebook of smoking cannabis later that night.

Williams was arrested two days later at a flat in Oldbury, West Midlands after he sent police a text message confessing to the murders.

It read: ‘I have killed my girlfriend. Her name is Yvonne Walsh and she’s upstairs in the bedroom.‘I’m not there, what should I do? You can’t phone me only text me.’

Rajiv Menon QC, defending, admitted there could be ‘no mitigation for these horrific and senseless murders’.

The judge told Williams: ‘The casual way in which you committed these killings was chilling. Your subsequent behaviour demonstrates how unconcerned you were at what you had done.’

Miss Walsh also had a three-year-old daughter from another relationship who was staying with her father when Williams struck.

Williams’s mother, Christine Logan, 56, from Swansea, said she ‘felt sick’ when she found her son had been arrested.

The mother-of-five said she had spoken to him that night after he left ‘worrying’ messages on Facebook.

‘I said to him, “What have you done now?” He replied, “Nothing, just smoking weed”. I said, “OK, have a good night.” He said, “I will”.’
