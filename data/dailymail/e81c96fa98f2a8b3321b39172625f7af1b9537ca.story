Discovery: A body has been found at the home of Cynthia Beamond, 80, who was last seen on Friday. A man and a woman now have been arrested on suspicion of murder

Police investigating the murder of a grandmother found dead at her home yesterday say her laptop, television and car are still missing and fear it could have been a burglary 'gone wrong'.

Cynthia Beamond, 80, was found dead at her semi-detached home in Halesowen, West Midlands, yesterday, two days after relatives reported her missing to police.

Today detectives said they had two people in custody on suspicion of murdering the pensioner, one of whom may have been known to her.

But they refused to reveal more about how she had died or where the body had been concealed.

And they appealed for help in finding her missing property.

Detective Superintendent Mark Payne, of West Midlands police, said police wanted to trace Mrs Beamond's silver Vauxhall Astra, and urged anybody who is offered a
 24 inch John Lewis TV or a red Hewlett Packard laptop to get in touch.

He added: 'Both of those items are missing from the home.  Officers are with the family who are clearly very distressed.'

The detective also revealed that whoever killed Mrs Beamond went to such great lengths to conceal her body that it was not found on an initial search of her home.

He said an initial search of her home 
found 'forensic evidence' which prompted a second search, during which 
Mrs Beamond's body was discovered.

He said: 'We believe she may have known one of her attackers, but it is not a family member.'

'What is clear is whoever killed Cynthia went to significant lengths to hide her body.

'The only person who knows where the body was hidden is the murderer, and I don't want to reveal more about that while we have people in custody.'

He added: 'Cynthia Beamond's body had been concealed with some care and was discovered after a meticulous forensic search of the property.'

A 23-year-old woman and a 32-year-old man are being held by police on suspicion of murder.

DS Payne said Mrs Beamond, a mother of two girls and grandmother of two girls, was reported missing by family members late on Friday evening.

Police said one possibility they were 
examining was that Mrs Beamond may have been attacked in a burglary gone
 wrong.

DS Payne said: 'Cynthia was a vibrant, outgoing and very friendly lady who lived life to the full.  This is a horrific offence against a vulnerable old lady who lived alone.

'We are working on the possible 
theory that this was a burglary gone wrong.  But it could also be a 
murder made to look like a burglary - only the murderer knows that.'

Neighbours
 said Mrs Beamond was a keen churchgoer who had volunteered with the 
West Midlands and Warwickshire Co-workers group, which supported Mother 
Theresa's work in India.

One resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'However it has happened it's a real tragedy. It is truly despicable. She was an angel, the way she helped out others less fortunate than herself.

'She had two daughters, who had a child each too. You can't even imagine what they must be going through. 

'If there's one person who did not deserve this, it is her. She was like a saint.'

Scene: Charity worker Mrs Beamond lived at her semi-detached home in Halesowen for more than 30 years

Another
 neighbour, Ernest Brasier, who has lived on the road for 12 years, 
added: 'It was a tremendous shock when she went missing.

'Her car was gone and they couldn't find it.  She was a lovely woman, I didn't know her very well but she always wanted to talk when she saw you.

'I do know she did a lot of charity work - she used to go to a place where they used to help feed people.

'That was during the day, it closed up at night so it was just a place for people to go during the day time.

'This is a very quiet, very safe place.  I can't think of there ever being any crime here before.'

Anyone with information on the car, the registration number of which is T419 MDA, the laptop or the television, is asked to call police on 101.
