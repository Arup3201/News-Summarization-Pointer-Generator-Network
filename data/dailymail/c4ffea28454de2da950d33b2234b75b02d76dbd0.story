One of the many ways you can arrange it: Russian architectural studio Ruetemple have created an apartment full of 'flexible furniture' on wheels that can be readjusted to create a bed, sofa and working space

The main piece they've created is an adaptable seating cube, which is on wheels and can be transformed into a double or single bed or a sofa with a few readjustments.

The cube has been created to serve as a chill-out area, a bed and sofas, which can free up space in the centre of the room.

Just chilling: The architects wanted to create a space free from the constraints of traditional furniture that homeowners could relax in easily without being cramped

So many options! The bed can be arranged into a number of different styles and is ideal for siblings sharing a bedroom

Lounging around: The best part is arguably a mezzanine hammock that is made from netting and is suspended over the room

That's clever! The interior project, which features a hammock designed for several people to lounge on, was completed for a TV show called Cottage Solution on NTV.

There's also a staircase that doubles as a bookshelf and a mezzanine hammock made from netting.

The room, in a family home in Russia, was designed as a space for studying, playing and relaxing.

'We decided to create a space free from typical furniture,' architects Alexander Kudimov and Daria Butahina told Dezeen.

'It was necessary to design a study space, guest sleeping accommodation and a space for various types of recreation, so that one could sit with a book, watch a movie, or welcome a crowd of friends, have a dance party and then accommodate everybody for a night, all in one room,' they added.

There's seats everywhere! The room, in a house in Russia, has been designed to accommodate lots of guests 

A LOT of thought has gone into this! There's also a staircase that doubles as a bookshelf in the quirky room 

How handy is that? The room, currently in a family home in Russia, was designed as a space for studying, playing and relaxing in
