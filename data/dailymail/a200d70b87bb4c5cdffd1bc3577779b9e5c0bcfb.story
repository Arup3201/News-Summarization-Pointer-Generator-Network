Getting an unexpected parking ticket can be very frustrating, and having your car towed away is even worse.

But when Hila Ben Baruch, from Tel Aviv, Israel, came back to find officials had painted a disabled bay around her legally parked car, she was understandably outraged.

CCTV footage shows she had parked her car in a bay outside her home on February 3, but it was later towed away by municipal workers after the space was turned into a disabled spot in her absence.

Ms Ben Baruch contacted the Tel Aviv authorities and was ordered to pay a total of 1350 NIS (£223) in fines and towing costs.

The angry motorist was adamant she had parked legally and managed to obtain CCTV footage which proved her right from a security company located opposite the car parking space.

She took to Facebook on February 5 to
vent her anger and posted the clip, which has since been shared more 
than 21,000 on the social networking site alone.

She said it was a 'big surprise' to find her car gone and when she saw a disabled bay had been painted there she said: 'I could not believe my eyes.

'Needless to say, the disabled parking was not there when I looked (it 
was a blue and white) and I refused to believe it. I called my friend 
who was with me when parking the vehicle, trying to make sure that I wasn't
crazy or getting senile, and confirmed we had parked blue and white.

'I discovered that there are security 
cameras in the building. A security company was very nice and agreed to 
show me the footage.'

She invited people to watch the video on her Facebook profile and said: 'Just to see and believe. Cry or laugh. 
While vehicles are parked blue and white, two municipal employees come and 
mark around the disabled parking!'

'Simply. Within five minutes they made me break 
the law. It's just bullying and contempt never seen before in the Tel Aviv 
municipality.

She added: 'But how could you do such a thing without
contacting me? It has a licence plate on the car and you can call, 
contact the owner and ask to move the vehicle.'

Ms Ben Baruch described feeling 'upset' when she contacted authorities and officials doubted her.

'He said I was lying, that he did not believe me,' she said.

Ms Ben Baruch says she plans to sue the city, which has already apologised for the incident.

'I will launch proceedings on the injustice and anguish, but above all for your transgressions.'
