Jon Hamm has opened up about his alcohol addiction for the first time.

News broke earlier this week that the Mad Men star had just completed a 30 day stint in rehab at the Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut. 

The 44-year-old said on Wednesday, ‘Life throws a lot at you sometimes and you have to deal with it as much as you can,’ in an interview with Australian magazine TV Week.

When the publication asked him if the life of an actor, where he is often challenged to inhabit dark characters, played a role in his alcoholism he was not entirely dismissive of the notion. 

'I've said in varying ways that acting can be a difficult endeavour,' Hamm admitted, 'certainly not as difficult as the recent example I used of being a baby heart surgeon.'

‘But,' he added, 'it does present its own challenges and so does life.’

Just after he checked out: Hamm attended a special screening of Mad Men on Saturday in New York City with the cast of the hit AMC show; here he is pictured with January Jones

One step at a time: Jon was seen heading home in Los Angeles on Wednesday

Staying busy: The same day, he suited up and flashed a smile while celebrating the final episode of Mad Men with the Black & Red Ball in LA 

The question was raised as his character Don Draper on Mad Men is not only plagued by personal demons but is a heavy drinker.

But Hamm was quick to note how fortunate he felt to have supportive family and friends by his side as he faces his own personal struggles.

A rep for the star told TMZ on Tuesday 'With the support of his longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt, Jon Hamm recently completed treatment for his struggle with alcohol addiction.

'They have asked for privacy and sensitivity going forward.'

On Tuesday he was spotted at LAX looking well dressed in a white double-breasted coat, black cardigan, grey trousers and black boots. He was also wearing a full beard, sunglasses and a hat. 

It is not known if Hamm has been in rehab before. His Mad Men character Don Draper was known for heavy drinking.

The Silver Hill Hospital is a psychiatric hospital that was established in 1931. The facility provides comprehensive psychiatric and addiction treatment services. The campus sits on 42 acres and the buildings have a New England style to them.

Though the facility is considered upscale, the rooms are pared down. Some even have two beds as often patients have roommates.

Speaking to Esquire in 2014, Jon revealed his sisters once encouraged him to see a therapist following the death of his mother from a brain aneurysm. 

'I had no concept of what that even meant,' he said. 'I’m a 20-year-old idiot, in the Midwest. This is not Woody Allen New York. We don’t sit around and talk about our feelings. We certainly don’t sit around and compare shrinks.' 

'I went to the lady. Sat down and talked to the lady. I gotta say, it helps. Talking to anybody helps. Talking to your friends helps. But your friends are your friends. They’ll tell you what you want to hear.

'The shrink doesn’t sugarcoat it: "Hey, you’re f***ed up. Do this, this and this. Don’t do this any more." It’s a wonderful third-person perspective that you get from an analyst. It’s invaluable, I think.'

He added that his performances as tormented advertising executive Don are based on personal experience.

He said:  'I hope that lends a deeper resonance. It’s not anything I’m doing consciously. All we can do as actors is bring our own personal experience to the role. 

'My mother died when I was ten, so I did have far more experience of being raised outside my family than I had from my own home, probably.'

In an interview with the Mail On Sunday in 2012, the actor admitted that his parallels with heavy drinker Don stopped at the character's love of  hard liquor.

‘I don’t drink as much as Don Draper,’he said. ‘I would be unconscious if I did.’ 

He also revealed to suffering from 'clinical depression' following the sudden death of his father when he was 20. 

'I very much knew what the idea of permanence was by that point. I dropped out of school, moved into the basement of my older half-sister Julie’s house, enrolled in a local college and sank into depression,' he said. 

An end: Jon's portrayal of the flawed Madison Avenue businessman will end in its seventh season beginning on April 5 as the AMC drama airs its final episodes

‘It was the classic definition of clinical depression; you want to stay in bed all day, you sleep till four o’clock in the afternoon. I didn’t have any drive to get up and do anything. It was rough: it stinks.

'Other people who are better than me at putting thoughts into words describe it as a black cloud that descends on you. You become numb. You feel so overwhelmed that it’s hard to take any step towards solving your situation.' 

Jon's portrayal of the flawed Madison Avenue businessman will end in its seventh season, which begins on April 5.

He earned a Best Actor  Golden Globe Award in 2008 for his role. 

Ready to promote the show: On Monday the star was seen with his cast again on the Today show in NYC

Since wrapping the series in July, Jon had a guest starring role in Tina Fey's uproarious Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.

Jon played Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne, a doomsday preacher who lures four women into an underground bunker for years after convincing them of an impending apocalypse - but they are later rescued.

The Office alum Ellie Kemper plays the title character opposite Tituss Burgess, Carol Kane and Jane Krakowski. 

'I was very glad they asked me to be a part of it,' he revealed to The Daily Beast. 

'Ellie Kemper is a really nice person, and I felt honored to be able to play in the sandbox with the cool kids again.'

Incredibly, Jon was 34-year-old Ellie's eighth grade teacher in 1993 after he graduated from the University of Missouri with an English degree and taught acting class at the same school he attended years earlier, John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri. 

Heavy drinker: Jon told the Mail On Sunday in 2012 that he would be 'unconscious' if he consumed as much alcohol as Don 

'I remember walking the red carpet at the Emmys and seeing Ellie there and going, "You're here, too! This is so great!"'

Speaking to GQ in a recent interview, Jon expressed fear about finding work after his run on Mad Men.

'Look, the one constant thing I've had in my career is now removed,' he said.

'And that's an eye-opener: Are people still going to take me seriously? Am I just going to do romantic comedies for the rest of my life? 

'What's next? And I don't know, you know? I wish I was smug enough to have had a grand plan.'

Different times: Don flourishes in an age where heavy drinking and smoking are encouraged
