Jake Livermore has quite literally been been prepared to go to Hull and back to make a name for himself.

A former pupil of Enfield Grammar School, Livermore thought he had fulfilled his boyhood dreams when he joined Tottenham but he was never satisfied with sitting at the back of his class.

'I was a local boy and Tottenham are my club, ten minutes from my home, but I had to get away and if it meant going 200 miles to play regular football then so be it,' says the Hull City midfielder.

'It was my decision. I'd had too many broken promises over the years at Tottenham; coaches saying I would get my chance if I played well then you would find another eight midfielders suddenly ahead of you,' adds Livermore.

'Look at Ryan Mason. He's made the breakthrough now but it should have happened three years ago when he was playing even better in my opinion.

'I dipped my toe in the water with Hull by going on loan and found everything I wanted. I enjoyed every minute and Steve Bruce and his staff were straight-talking, there was no sugar coating, just this is how it is. It was a breath of fresh air.'

The appreciation was mutual and Hull made him their then record £8million signing in the summer despite interest from the likes of Crystal Palace and others.

Livermore is a personable character and it's quickly apparent that, after years of frustration, he is enjoying his football.

His middle name is Cyril, 'after his grandfather, not the ex-Tottenham defender Cyril Knowles', though 'he was a decent footballer and passed on some good genes' and his nickname is 'Tache', or at least the only one he can repeat, which is owed to the pencil-thin moustache he has been cultivating albeit 'without much success'.

However, while he has ambitions for his moustache, it is his reputation as a one of England's most promising midfielders that he would prefer to cultivate.

Livermore has one England cap, awarded after he came on for Frank Lampard in a 2-1 win over Italy in 2012, and has been encouraged by Roy Hodgson's recent selections that he can maybe stake a claim to at least earn a second one.

'I've got a 100 percent record as an England player,' he laughs. 'I'd love to play for my country again. Mr Hodgson picked me that night and I'd love another chance. it's something all players aspire to. Fabian Delph has shown that if you continue to play well you can earn your reward and that has to be my aim at Hull. If I play well hopefully Mr Hodgson will take a look.'

Livermore, 24, is part of an exciting, fluid midfield alongside his pal Tom Huddlestone, Mohamed Elmohamady and Mohamed Diame at Hull but Saturday pits him against a player he has always used as his yardstick in Liverpool's Steven Gerrard.

'I used to study Luka Modric, who is a hell of a player, but Gerrard has been my hero since I turned professional,' enthuses Livermore. 'I played against him for Tottenham once when he was coming back from injury and I learned more in ten minutes than I did in four years from coaching. He not only had supreme confidence in his own ability but he gave it to those around him. 

'He brought a calmness to their game and dictated the pace. As a midfielder, one of the most difficult aspects is finding space but his movement was such he made it look easy. If I emulate anything close to what he has done in the game it would be fantastic.'

Not that Livermore will be standing back and admiring Liverpool's talisman on Saturday.

'He is a leader and he will be getting them up for the game after their result against Madrid but I'd like to earn respect by playing well against him. Whatever happened we would expect a tough game but we've got a good bunch here at Hull.

'People ask ''who's the joker in your group?'' but we have about 30 of them. We've got a great team spirit and plenty of quality. The manager has attracted players such as Curtis Davies, Abel Hernandez and Hatem Ben Arfa; nearly all of us are players with something to prove who have been given a second chance. That gives us a certain edge.

'I thought I'd got rid of Michael Dawson! But he followed me here because he knew we were building something special. Like myself and Tom, he still wants to show what he can do and it means we are putting together a few surprise performances like we did at Arsenal last week.'

Roy Hodgson take note, everyone deserves a second chance.
