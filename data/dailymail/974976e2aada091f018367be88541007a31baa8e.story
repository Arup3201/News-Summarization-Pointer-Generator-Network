Three animal shelter workers have been put on paid leave as investigators determine why an adopted puppy was euthanized on the day it was due to go to its new home.

German Shepherd JoJo, one, was waiting for his new owners to arrive when Hillsborough County Animal Services staff mistakenly put him down on October 8.

The workers were initially relieved of duties
relating to euthanasias, but managers decided on Thursday to place them on leave.

Tampa Bay Times reported the three employees were Sue Padgett, an animal care supervisor with 26 years in the department, and senior animal care assistants Debra Parker and Bradley Hansen.

Parker worked at the shelter for two years, while Hansen had been there for about one year.

Shelter director Ian Hallett would not comment on whether the workers would be re-instated. 

'The administrative leave is simply procedural while the investigation is ongoing, and there have been no disciplinary determinations made,' Hallett told Tampa Bay Times.

Hallett
previously apologized for the 'regrettable' death, blaming human error.

He said the family had visited the shelter to adopt a puppy, but fell in 
love with JoJo.

After the dog was accidentally put down Hallett 
contacted them personally.

'Sadly, JoJo had been selected for 
adoption and was to be picked up by his new family later that day ... a 
combination of human errors may have been the cause of JoJo’s 
euthanization,' he said.

'It looks like the file was not cleared 
for euthanasia but the procedure was done.'

Apology: Shelter director Ian Hallett says the staff responsible have been placed on paid leave

However, this was not the first time Hillsborough County Animal Services had made a fatal error.

It has been alleged there were about four mistaken killings over the summer period.

In April last year a mixed dog named Zeus, who had been adopted, was accidentally euthanized only an hour after arriving at the shelter.

The shelter has also been criticized over illness at the center, including a recent outbreak of Parvovirus, a contagious and potentially fatal dog disease, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Mistake: JoJo is not the first adopted dog to have been accidentally euthanized

Hallett was brought in as director last year to implement changes at the shelter and try to reduce its high kill rate. About 12,000 animals a year are euthanized at the center.

Since taking over he has extended the center's opening hours to allow more potential adopters to visit the animals being held there.

However, he has been under repeated criticism for problems with managing the spread of disease and poor communication of shelter goals and procedures, according to Tampa Bay Times.

Dogma Pet Rescue owner Amy Howland says the workers are 'overworked and stressed'. She said it was inevitable workers made mistakes when they were tired.
