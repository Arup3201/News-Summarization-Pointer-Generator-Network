Mark Lawrenson has slammed Liverpool as 'rudderless' and admits that Brendan Rodgers' team selections have left him baffled.

Rodgers' side currently languish in ninth position in the Premier League and were knocked out of the Champions League on Tuesday night.

And former Liverpool defender Lawrenson believes his old club have gone backwards after their 3-0 victory over United at Old Trafford in March.

Lawrenson told the BBC: 'It is eight months since Liverpool blew Manchester United away to win 3-0 at Old Trafford but it seems an awful lot longer than that.

'To be frank, Liverpool are all over the place at the moment. They are rudderless, low on confidence and do not seem to have a definitive way of playing.'

'I do not understand some of Brendan Rodgers' selections - leaving [Adam] Lallana out against Basel mystified me, as did the inclusion of [Jose] Enrique, who looked overweight.'
