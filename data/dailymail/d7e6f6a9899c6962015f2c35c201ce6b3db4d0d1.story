The £500million redevelopment of the BBC's former HQ in west London will include a plush private members' club, a rooftop pool and terrace and a hotel, it has been revealed.

Television Centre in White City, which was sold by the corporation for £200million in 2012, will host a branch of Soho House, a private members' club for those in film, media and the creative industries which has expanded to include clubs, hotels, restaurants and spas across the world.

Developers Stanhope said it hopes to start the redevelopment, which has outline planning for about 950 homes, offices, shops and restaurants, in April next year.

The revamp will keep many of the original features of the listed buildings including the famous ‘doughnut’, atomic dot wall and statue of Helios.

However, some buildings will be demolished and replaced with a new ten-storey office building, which will house the club, swimming pool and roof terrace for Soho House.

The BBC will remain at Television Centre operating three studios through its commercial subsidiaries BBC Studios and Post Production and BBC Worldwide, which will be based at Television Centre, following a refurbishment from early 2015.

Nick Jones, CEO of Soho House, said: 'The area has a rich and varied tradition of creative talent and the development of Television Centre will provide a worthy addition to the area and a new home from home for member’s to work and relax in.'

David Camp, CEO of Stanhope, said:  'Since we received planning permission at the end of last year we have been looking in more detail at how we can realise our vision for Television Centre as a vibrant heart to the wider White City district of London.'

Stanhope paid £200million for a 999-year lease on the site in July 2012.

BBC Television Centre officially opened in June 1960 and is recognised throughout the UK and the world

Many of the site's famous features, such as the the famous 'doughnut' shape and atomic dot wall, will remain

The BBC finally left the building in March 2013 despite bitter opposition from many of its own stars, including Michael Parkinson and comedian David Mitchell.

The corporation spent an estimated £224million setting up a new northern base - MediaCityUK in Salford - to help redress a perceived London-centric bias in its coverage, although the BBC says it is closer to £180million when the savings from relinquishing property in London is taken into account.

The lifetime budgeted cost of relocation 
and operating costs up to 2030 for Salford is £942million, or £573 million taking inflation into account.

The radio and television news departments moved to Broadcasting House in central London, the home of BBC Radio, between July 2012 and March 2013.
