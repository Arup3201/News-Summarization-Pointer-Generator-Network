Iraqi forces retook a key strategic town from Islamic State militants today in a victory that has been hailed as a possible turning point in the fight against jihadis overrunning the country.

Barwanah, in Iraq's Anbar province, has been gripped by vicious fighting for months since IS fighters overran the region last December.

But yesterday, after American warplanes carried out strikes in the area, Iraqi troops finally broke through IS defences as part of a major operation  to wrest back the province from the clutches of the extremist horde.

The news came as key Arab allies vowed to 'destroy' the Islamic State 'wherever it is' and do more to stop radical jihadists journeying from their homelands to join the 'holy war' waged in Iraq and Syria. 

And in a further boost to the fight against IS in Iraq and Syria, France today pledged to join America's airstrike campaign as president Francois Hollande made the first visit by a foreign head of state since the extremist group took hold.

The ten Middle Eastern allies, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, made the announcement to crush the IS insurgency following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in the Red Sea coastal city of Jiddah.

But the summit was held under a shadow yesterday after Nato member Turkey refused to join in, signaling the struggle the U.S. faces in trying to get front-line nations to put aside their regional animosities and work together to defeat a common enemy. 

But despite Turkey's refusal to support the drive, the fight against the Islamic State was nonetheless given a boost today as France vowed to join the U.S. campaign of airstrikes in the country.

The Arab states' endorsement of a broad strategy to stop the flow of fighters and funding to the insurgents, and possibly to join military action, came as the CIA doubled its assessment of how many fighters the extremist group can muster.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress lined up on Thursday behind President Barack Obama's call to combat the militants.

They did so a day after he laid out a long-term campaign that would include expanding airstrikes against the fighters in Iraq, launching strikes against them in Syria for the first time and bolstering the Iraqi military and moderate Syrian rebels to allow them to reclaim territory from the militants.

Kerry's visit, on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, was aimed at pinning down how much support regional allies are willing to give to the U.S. plan to beat back the Islamic State group, which has seized large chunks of Iraq and Syria. 

Nearly 40 nations have agreed to contribute to what Kerry said would be a worldwide fight to defeat the militants.

Ruthless: Greater regional support is seen as critical to combatting the spread of the Islamic State group, which has proved so ruthless that even al-Qaida severed ties with it earlier this year

'The devastating consequences of extremist hate remain fresh in the minds of all Americans, and to so many of our friends and allies around the world,' Kerry said of the terror attacks on the U.S. 13 years ago. 'Those consequences are felt every day here in the Middle East.'

Also today, France promised to join the U.S.-led airstrikes targeting extremists in Iraq as part of an expanding international effort to combat the Islamic State group, Iraq's new prime minister said after talks with the French president on Friday.

Haider al-Abadi's remarks came after talks with Francois Hollande, who was in Baghdad to bolster Iraq's new government as it struggles to unite the nation amid the rampage by the Islamic State group.

'In order to confront Daesh, we need aerial support from our allies,' al-Abadi said, referring to the group by its Arabic acronym. 'The French president promised me today that France will participate in this effort, hitting the positions of the terrorists in Iraq.'

Al-Abadi spoke at a joint press conference with Hollande in Baghdad. Neither of the two leaders provided details about when the French could join the aerial campaign.

Hollande added that France has delivered four arms shipments and 60 metric tons (66 tons) of humanitarian equipment to Iraq. 

But Western allies know the fight against IS cannot be won without greater regional support on the issue. 

New intelligence assessments estimate the extremists can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria, up from a previous figure of 10,000, the CIA said on Thursday.

CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani said the new total reflects stronger recruitment by the extremists since June, following battlefield successes and the group's declaration of an Islamic state, or caliphate, on territory under its control.

Only Turkey would not back the plans against IS, after it was asked to secure its borders to prevent oil smuggling out of Iraq and Syria and keep foreign fighters from heading in. But Ankara has been reluctant to take a prominent role in the coalition, in part out of concern for the 49 Turkish citizens who were kidnapped from the Turkish consulate in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul when it was overrun by Islamic State fighters in June.

U.S. officials played down Turkey's absence from the communique, noting that the Turkish government is still extremely concerned about the fate of its diplomats. A senior State Department official predicted the U.S. will continue to work with Turkey to repel the insurgent threat, and said Ankara is in a difficult position as it tries to protect the hostages. The official was not authorized to discuss the sensitive negotiations by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Squabbling among Washington's allies in the region has complicated efforts to present a united front to beat back the militants.

Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Egypt are at odds with Qatar and Turkey because of the latter two countries' support for the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups in the region.

Egypt's foreign minister, Sameh Shukri, emphasized that rift in his opening remarks, saying regional chaos is the result of a number of factors, including the tolerance of some in the region and the West for 'so-called political Islam' - a clear dig at supporters of the Brotherhood.

American officials have voiced concerns too about the willingness of Kuwait and Qatar to crack down on private fundraising for extremist groups.
