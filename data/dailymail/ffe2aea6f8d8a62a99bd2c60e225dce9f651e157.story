Dominic Webster suffers from nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a condition that affects just one in 25,000 people

A four-year-old boy has to drink more than 20 litres of water every day because of a rare kidney disorder. 

Dominic Webster suffers from nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a condition that affects just one in 25,000 people. 

The rare disorder means his body's water regulating system is disrupted, causing him to suffer from extreme thirst.

Not only does Dominic drink gallons 
of water each day, he must also maintain a low salt diet and could need a
kidney transplant when he is older. 

Mother Katie Webster, 28, from Bolton, Manchester, knew just after Dominic was born that something was wrong.

She
said: 'Dominic was under a paediatrician since birth and they checked 
for everything and said they would have to discharge him, but because I 
persisted they sent him for one last scan where they found he had 
problems.

'I felt 
relieved that they found something because I felt like I was being a 
worrying, hypochondriac mother but I also felt sad that he will be able 
to lead a normal but very limited life.'

According to NHS Choices, the condition affects one in 25,000 people, including adults, across the UK.

It is usually caused by injury or infection and people of all ages and ethnicities can be affected.

Medics do not yet know how Dominic's 
condition will affect him as he grows up, but Mrs Webster, and her 
husband, Dominic's father, Neil, aged 44, have already been told that he
has just 10 per cent function in his left kidney.

DI is a condition caused by too little antidiuretic hormone (ADH) being produced by the body.

ADH is made in the a part of the brain called the hypothalamus.

A deficiency causes a patient to pass too much urine - in the most severe cases a person can pass up to 20 litres a day.

Because of this, fluid levels in the body can drop dangerously low, causing severe dehydration.

The condition places stress on the kidneys.

The kidneys play a vital role in a many different bodily functions.

They are responsible for filtering toxic waste and extra fluid from the body, maintaining blood pressure and producing red blood cells.

Treatment involves staying hydrated and taking medication to control symptoms.

When he was a baby, Dominic suffered from unexplained fevers, vomiting, was irritable, had headaches and was constantly tired. 

He was finally diagnosed with the rare condition in January.

Mrs Webster said: 'He is very clever for is age and he is aware of his problems. He will say to people he has a kidney problem.'

She added: 'We have to be very careful with his diet. He has to have a low salt and sugar diet and low protein diet with few processed meats. 

'He drinks excessively - it can be up to 20 litres a day and will go to the toilet 20 to 30 times a day.

'When everybody at nursery is having cake and fruit drinks he can't have them. He absolutely loves chocolate and sweets too.'

Mrs Webster said Dominic is able to eat most of the same meals as his brothers and sisters - Jordan, aged 11, Abigail, aged 10 and five-year-old Isabel, as she cooks his food in a different pan and does not use salt. 

Dominic is not on any medication but has undergone several operations while under the care of three specialists at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, and he has appointments every six weeks.
