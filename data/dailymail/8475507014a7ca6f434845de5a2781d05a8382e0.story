A Good Samaritan who followed a drunk man out of a Chicago bar and attempted to reason with him not to drive was tragically killed as a result of attempted good dead.

Shane Stokowski, 33, was enjoying drinks with friends at the Aberdeen Tap on Saturday at 5pm when he noticed another man – clearly inebriated – start to leave after being refused further drinks.

Stokowski followed Timothy McShane, who had a suspended driver’s license and previous DUI arrests, into the bar’s parking lot.

Shane Stokowski, 33, was tragically killed after he tried to prevent a drunk driver from leaving the car park of a Chicago bar in his vehicle

He watched as McShane, 42, got into his girlfriend's black SUV and hit several parked cars trying to leave, according to court documents.

Stokowski approached the SUV and leaned into the driver's side window to stop McShane but he kept driving, carrying Stokowski along for nearly a block before he fell and struck his head on the pavement, prosecutors say. 

He was rushed to hospital, but died less than an hour later of blunt trauma to the head and abrasions from the pavement, reports the Chicago Sun Times.

Instead of stopping or contacting police, McShane, a construction worker, drove to his girlfriend’s house, parked her Nissan Murano and fell asleep for three hours.

Timothy McShane, 42, had a suspended driver¿s license and previous DUI arrests. He told police that Stokowski had tried to attack him and that he fled in fear

When police found him at 10pm, McShane told them that Stokowski had tried to attack him and that he fled in fear, according to a police report.

McShane, a father of one, also told officers that Stokowski tried to rob and beat him and made a mark on his neck, the report said.

The man was taken to a local police station and even at 1:06 am on Sunday McShane’s blood-alcohol level was still .225, more than twice the state’s legal .08 limit.

McShane is being held in lieu of $350,000 bail for reckless homicide, aggravated DUI and leaving the scene of an accident.

He has a list of prior DUI offenses dating back to 1993.

Stokowski, who was engaged to be married, worked as an animator and illustrator for a health care company. His funeral will take place on Friday.
