The bedroom of a French soldier has remained unchanged for almost 100 years since he was killed in the First World War.

When dragoons officer Hubert Rochereau was killed in Belgium in 1918, his parents preserved his old bedroom as a permanent shrine to their son.

And when they sold the large family house in 1936, they stipulated that it should not be changed for another 500 years.

Shrine: Hubert Rochereau's old cavalry helmet sits on his made bed nearly 100 years after he was killed

Now the bedroom in the village of Belabre, central France, has become a poignant memorial to the young officer who was born there in 1896 and died in battle of Loker, in Flanders, almost a century ago.

A moth-eaten army uniform is still on its hanger, photographs sit on his desk alongside a packet of cigarettes, and a lace bedspread is still on the bed with his feathered helmet.

The shelves and walls are adorned with his sword, a fencing helmet and a collection of pistols. On his desk is a vial labelled 'the soil of Flanders on which our dear child fell and which has kept his remains for four years.'

Rochereau died in the back of an English field ambulance on April 26, 1918, one day after he was wounded during a battle for control for the Belgian village of Loker.

A second lieutenant with the 15th Dragoons Regiment based in Libourne, near Bordeaux, he received a posthumous croix de guerre and the Legion of Honour for his courage in battle.

The regiment's history, seen by the Guardian, records Rochereau's commander was killed by a bullet to the head after giving a 'heroic' order to counter-attack in Loker, which changed hands several times.

The house's current owner Daniel Fabre has preserved the bedroom in its original state and said he hopes any new owner will do the same.

He told the Nouvelle Republique newspaper: 'This clause had no legal basis, but we believe the room should be left unchanged.

'If we sell, we will be looking for a new owner that respects Hubert Rochereau's memory and keeps this extraordinary museum piece intact.'

Rochereau, a second lieutenant with the 15th Dragoons Regiment based in Libourne, near Bordeaux, received a posthumous croix de guerre medal for his extreme bravery on the battlefield.

He was one of 580,000 soldiers who died on that part of the western front in the 1914-18 war.

He is also remembered on the village war memorial and on a monument to the fallen in Libourne.
