Dr Drew Pinsky has managed to offend not only an innocent couple who phoned in for his help on a recent episode of Loveline, but also endometriosis sufferers around the country and beyond.

The reality TV doctor, who has hosted Celebrity Rehab and a number of subsequent spin-offs, interrupted his caller as he was explaining that his fiancee had endometriosis, lactose intolerance and interstitial cystitis.

'These are what we call sort of functional disorders,' he began. 'They're sort of... they're what we call "garbage bag disorders," when you can't think of anything else, you go, "Eh, well it's that."'

In hot water: Dr Drew (pictured) has come under fire for labeling endometriosis a 'garbage bag disorder' while offering advice to a caller on his radio show, Loveline

He then proceeded to suggest that perhaps she was 'visiting doctors all the time' because she was sexually abused growing up.

Surprisingly, the male caller confirmed that indeed she had been sexually abused, at which point Dr Drew somewhat triumphantly leapt into his next diatribe.

'The only way her body, which was suffering during those early experiences, can tell its tale of woe is with pain,' he says, describing the 'unexplained' discomfort as 'somatoform dissociation'.

'She really needs to see a trauma specialist, not a urologist. Know what I'm saying?'

In a shock move, Dr Drew promptly hung up, giving his caller no opportunity to ask his actual question.

Regretting that now? Dr Drew, pictured during the segment on Loveline in which he made the inflammatory comments, has since semi-apologized amid a fierce backlash

Endometreosis is defined as the abnormal growth of cells, 
	similar to those that form the inside of the uterus, but in a location 
	outside of the uterus.

Endometriosis can make it more difficult for a woman to conceive a child

Pelvic pain during menstruation or ovulation can be a symptom of the disorder.

Treatment of endometriosis includes medication and surgery for both pain relief and treatment of infertility if pregnancy is desired.

The internet was quickly awash with angry respondents, many of whom are sufferers of endometrosis - which is defined by medicinenet.com as 'the abnormal growth of cells, 
	similar to those that form the inside of the uterus, but in a location 
	outside of the uterus.'

'How can you call it a garbage bag disorder when the patient has actual positive diagnostic tests?' wrote one angry viewer on Loveline's comment section. 'Did my urologist etch-a-sketch ulcers in my bladder? Did my gynecologist doodle in my over growing uterine lining?'

Another wrote: 'I am one of 200 million women with this disorder. I miss work every month, Fashion Week, 
friend's birthdays, parties, etc. It affects every part of my life.'

Indeed, Padma Lakshmi, the stunning host of Bravo's hit show Top Chef, is just one celebrity who has spoken out previously about her very real battle with the disorder.

'I became very angry at the fact that I personally was only diagnosed with endometriosis at age 36,' she said during a TV appearance, describing repeated doctor visits over the course of her life which failed to turn up answers. 'I thought that the doctors knew better. Doctors should listen to patients and patients should listen to their own bodies.'

Ms Lakshmi subsequently underwent successful excision surgery to remove her endometriosis and went on to have a child. She is now the co-founder of the Endometriosis Foundation of America.

In response to the negative backlash Dr Drew received, he offered a sheepish apology on last night's Lifeline. He told listeners that he didn't mean that all endometriosis 
diagnoses were 'garbage', just that in the case of that 
particular caller, it sounded like doctors were searching in vain for an 
explanation for her pain.

Trouble at home: Dr Drew's 22-year-old daughter, Paulina Pinsky (left) recently revealed she had been struggling with bulimia for seven years, without her father or mother Susan (right) noticing

Dr Drew's flippant solution to this problem isn't his only public comment to cause a stir.

In 2010, when asked for his parenting opinion in the case of troubled star Lindsay Lohan, he declared: 'If [she] were my daughter, I would pack her car full with illegal substances,
 send her on her way, call the police, and make sure she was arrested. I
 would make sure she was not allowed to get out of jail.'

Ironically for the man with the iron fist, only this year, his own daughter, 22-year-old Paulina Pinsky, revealed she had been suffering from bulimia for seven years, right under the very nose of her father, who is trained in the field of eating disorders.

'This condition, like many, is cunning, and hiding and secrecy is a feature of the condition,' he said of his daughter's public confession.
