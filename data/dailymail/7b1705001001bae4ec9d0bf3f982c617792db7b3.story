His colourful past has included a spell behind bars and a stint on a reality TV show.

But Lord Charles Brocket broke new ground last week when a convoy of removal vans packed with his family’s art and antique furniture was pursued by eight police cars up a busy motorway.

Far from being the result of a daring heist, however, staff working for the peer were pulled over by officers as he attempted – he claims rightfully – to reclaim a number of valuable family heirlooms at the centre of a financial dispute.

Lord Brocket, who attempted - he claims rightfully - to reclaim a number of valuable family heirlooms

Lord 
Brocket and a team of removal men with three vans had taken the items 
from his family estate – Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire – early on 
Thursday morning.

He
 had driven ahead but officers caught up with the vans nearby on the A1M
 and forced their drivers to return the antiques to the stately home 
pending a police investigation.

Last night, Lord Brocket, 62, told the Daily Mail: ‘It is a total farce.

‘The contents are worth millions of pounds and include furniture plus art from Van Dyck – items which have been in our family for a long time. I’m gobsmacked that on the Queen’s highway somebody can be stopped by the police for transporting their own furniture.’

The row centres on the contents of Brocket Hall, which he was forced to lease when he was jailed for an insurance scam in the 1990s because he could not afford to maintain the £200million estate from prison.

A second agreement was drawn up so that 
the antique contents of the hall could also be rented, and it is an 
alleged failure to keep up with payments on this contract that led to 
Lord Brocket’s dawn raid on the 500-acre estate.

The peer, his estate agent and 43 removal men apparently walked in to the hall through open doors and claimed almost all of the furniture and antiques inside – including works by Van Dyck, Daniel Mytens and Sir Edwin Landseer and a pair of George II walnut side tables. The items removed are thought to be worth more than £2million.

Lord Brocket, who has appeared on TV reality show I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!, added: ‘The police have hijacked a couple of million pounds worth of stuff but haven’t asked any questions about who owns it. What is going on? Why was that?’

Brocket Hall was built in 1760 and has housed royalty, prime ministers and one of Lord  Byron’s lovers.

Lord Brocket’s family bought the estate about a century ago and he inherited it from his grandfather in 1971.

But in 1996 the Old Etonian and former Army officer was jailed for five years for a fraudulent £4.3million insurance claim on four of his vintage sports cars. He decided to lease the property for £9million for 60 years.

The property has been rented since then by Brocket Hall International, part of Hong Kong-based CCA International, which is run by German hotelier Dieter Klostermann. The estate has been run as a historic house and golf club, used for corporate entertainment, conferences, exhibitions and weddings.

Mr Klostermann and BHI did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokesman for Hertfordshire Constabulary said: ‘Detectives from Hatfield’s Local Crime Unit are currently investigating an incident that occurred at Brocket Hall on Thursday morning.

‘Officers attended the estate following a report of property being taken. Following officers’ attendance, the property was returned.

‘Currently, officers are attempting to establish the exact circumstances of what has happened and whether any criminal offences have been committed.’

Fladgate solicitors, for the trustees of the First Lord Brocket Will Trust which owns and leases the property, said in a statement: 'Much of the contents of Brocket Hall in terms of the pictures, Brocket family portraits and family heirlooms have been licenced to a tenant, a company called Brocket Hall (Jersey) Ltd which currently operates Brocket Hall as a golf course and conference centre. 

'The trustees of Brocket Hall ended the licences with the tenant in November 2013 and requested the return of the items to the trust.

'The tenant is legally obliged to return these items to the Trustees. Despite written requests to the tenant’s solicitors, the tenant has failed to return the items.

'Yesterday morning (19th June), a removal company, at the request of the trustees went into the Hall, as they had the right to do, without the use of any force, and removed many of the contents that belonged to them.  The contents were removed in three separate vans. 

'We believe that the incident may have been mistakenly reported as a theft. It was not a theft. 

'The Trustees are entitled to possession of those goods. The tenant (Brocket Hall (Jersey) Ltd) is well aware that the licences allowing it to use the goods ended last November and no argument has ever been received from the tenant to the contrary.  The tenant knows that it is not entitled to the goods and has no right to be using them.'
