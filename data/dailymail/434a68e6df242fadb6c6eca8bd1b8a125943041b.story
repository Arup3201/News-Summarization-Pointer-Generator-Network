From the little we know about Andrej Kramaric, he seems to be an individual who doesn’t want to pile too much pressure on himself.

‘I hope to score at least one goal and be better than Bosko Balaban!’ he grinned this week. There may have a been just a hint of humour attributed to that - his Croatian counterpart was a key component in the £9million move to Leicester - but Kramaric looks set to leave the Aston Villa flop behind and become a Premier League hit.

That’s if his full Foxes debut at Tottenham on Saturday is anything to go by.

Playing in behind Leonardo Ulloa, Kramaric was a bundle of energy and willing runner for a team who have so often lacked genuine options going forward away from home this season.

Nigel Pearson will know he has a man who could be the key to survival this season - that added touch of invention and glimmer on the ball to open up gaps and allow Leicester’s wide players - Jeffrey Schlupp and Jamie Vardy in this case - to find their way in behind.

The 23-year-old was the main outlet for Pearson here at White Hart Lane, and that bodes well for the immediate future. Having scored 28 goals already this season, more ought to follow.

Kramaric is used to playing in front of barely 4,000 supporters for HNK Rijeka in Croatia, but doesn’t appear fazed by the daunting prospect of English football that Balaban and countless others struggled with. It’s Manchester United at Old Trafford up next.

And he’s already been given a taste of what flair players at the top of the domestic game can expect; unfortunately, this experience wasn’t one he will have dreamt of back home.

With Leicester a goal down, Kramaric scampered beyond the square-footed Younes Kaboul and bore down on Michel Vorm after Danny Drinkwater’s through ball. One-on-one, these are the situations he was bought for. One touch and off he went past the goalkeeper, ready to tap into an unguarded net. That would’ve been the only logical end to the move, but Vorm tripped him before the youngster had chance to equalise.

On first viewing it was a clear penalty, but referee Robert Madley marched up to the attacker, signalled a dive and brandished a yellow card. Welcome to our world, Andrej, where officials are so petrified of being indecisive that everything is black and white.

Kramaric did not dive - it was not a booking. The trick for him now is to shrug the episode off.

He might have had that first goal for the club but, when stealing a yard in front of Fazio, met Vorm in inspired form - the Dutchman somehow managing to tip wide when Kramaric lashed at goal from eight yards.

The signs for why Jose Mourinho fancied Kramaric at Chelsea are there for all to see. He must just hope that Madley doesn’t follow him in the weeks to come.
