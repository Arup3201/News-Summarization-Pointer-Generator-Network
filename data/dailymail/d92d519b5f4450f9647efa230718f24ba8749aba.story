Tragedy: Nicholas Dellaventura collapsed and died during football practice in July 2012 at St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School in Staten Island

The enraged family of a Staten Island teenager who collapsed from heat stroke and died during practice last year are suing his school for $10 million negligence.

Alleging that Nicholas Dellaventura, 15, was ordered to carry on on the field, despite telling his coach and Gambino family associate Salvatore Ferraioli that he was ill, his parents are suing St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School and the Archdiocese of New York.

Collapsing in July last year, Dellaventura's body temperature had soared to 110 degrees and the star freshman died hours after Ferraioli allegedly made him continue practice.

The Dellaventura attorney, Ralph DeSimone told the New York Post that Ferraioli kept the 5-foot-8, 210-pound offensive linesman on the field in the mid-80s heat even after he had tried to pull out due to illness.

'These kids were winded...Nicholas had pulled himself off the field because he couldn't do it anymore, and he was told to go back and finish the practice,' said DeSimone.

Ferraioli, who resigned in August 2012 after he was arrested and implicated in a Gambino gambling ring is alleged to have shouted somthing at Dellaventura that made him remain on the field.

Dellaventura, a student at St. Joseph By-The-Sea HS, had finished a 90-minute-workout with his teammates who then huddled round to listen to their coach, New York Archdiocese spokeswoman Fran Davies told the New York Post

However, Ferraioli's lawyer denied that his client put the boy in any danger and alleged that Dellaventura's mother, Maria, knew her son was battling a fever caused by an infection.

'She sent him to practice knowing he had a fever,' said McMahon to the New York Post.

Dellaventura family attorney Ralph DeSimone said that the teenager was forced back onto the field after tying to leave in July 2012

DeSimone said that Dellaventura had a 'clean bill of health' and that officials at the school did not react fast enough to save the teen when he collapsed.

'They did not call 911 right away. They did not administer any type of proper first aid to him when he was in distress. There’s elementary things they could have done here that anyone with any kind of rudimentary training would have known,' DeSimone said.

'If you treat the situation in the first 10 minutes, it’s 100 percent survivable.'

However, athletic director Greg Manos said that the school followed state-mandated protocols.

'There was no way that workout could have done that to Nicholas. He was running basic drills,' said football coach Sean Cusick at the time.

The sophomore from New York City’s Staten Island was breathing and had a soaring temperature when paramedics rushed him to hospital, according to the FDNY. 

Dellaventura, a student at St. Joseph By-The-Sea HS, had finished a 90-minute-workout with his teammates who then huddled round to listen to their coach, New York Archdiocese spokeswoman Fran Davies told the New York Post.

Coaches and teammates then saw that Dellaventura was struggling to breathe and couldn’t stand up from kneeling, Davies said.

They gave him first aid and called paramedics. As they waited for the ambulance to arrive Dellaventura remained conscious and verbally responsive, Davies said.

Several hours later he was pronounced dead at Staten Island University Hospital South.

The boy’s football coach, Rich Clark, told the Post that he was a ‘really nice kid’ who always had a smile on his face.

'There are not enough nice things you can say about the kid. I feel like I lost a member of my family,’ he told the Post.
