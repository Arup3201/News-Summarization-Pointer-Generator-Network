It's been a rollercoaster year for rock band INXS since announcing their retirement.

The Aussie rockers dealt with major tragedy and then watched it all play out on the small screen miniseries INXS: Never Tear Us Apart.

Despite the personal challenges, the band has topped the highest-selling album in Australia with their greatest hits, The Very Best, which stayed at the No.1 spot for seven weeks this year after the success of the record-breaking four-hour miniseries.

The band realised the popular telemovie had quite a hand to play in the resurgence in their popularity, which also sparked a surge in sales, selling more than 280,000 copies.

'To be honest, with the miniseries coming out it's no surprise we sold a few more records,' said guitarist Tim Farriss.

'I never guessed we would sell that many to make quadruple platinum and the biggest selling album in Australia for the year, which is fantastic and a great honour.'

One of the reasons band member Kirk Pengilly thinks it pushed INXS back into the spotlight is because it showed people at home just how much the guys put into their music.

'The thing I got from it was now all Australians know how hard we worked and what we actually achieved. I don't think a lot of Australians were really aware of that,' Pengilly said.

But it hasn't just been a year of celebration for the Farriss brothers - Jon, Andrew and Tim - who lost their father just a few weeks ago.

Andrew also revealed his wife has been battling breast cancer.

'I was struggling about whether to say this, but I'll tell the truth. When all that was happening (the making of the TV miniseries) my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, so I wasn't really concerned with the past or what it meant,' he said.

'I love these guys ... but I was very much in the now. So for me, I then replay it as an amazing blessing to have had all those accolades and attention given at the time I was just absolutely smacked with reality from a different area,' he said.

His wife is doing better and he says he now feels lucky the band have had this experience.

'It's been an interesting year,' he said.

The band seem used to the crazy highs and lows they've had to endure, not least of all losing their frontman Michael Hutchence, who died in 1997.

They agree that this year has been particularly mixed with hardship and success, but Tim says 'nothing comes in small measure for us. It's always INXS'.

For the most part, they were happy with how the TV series turned out and Tim in particular was very hands-on, as an executive producer on the show.

'Tim was there all the way through it and we're indebted to Tim for that - to relive it again and have the rollercoaster of emotion it must have taken its toll,' Jon said.

 Despite their sudden retirement in 2012, the band has not ruled out a reunion completely

While it was difficult to portray everything perfectly in a four-hour miniseries, the band agrees it captured the essence or the vibe of that time in their life very accurately.

Tim said the actor who played Michael Hutchence, Luke Arnold, was so like the frontman, that it was almost eerie.

'The similarities, it was honestly like being in the same room as him,' Tim said.

The band announced their sudden retirement in 2012 after a live performance in Perth, but they haven't ruled out a reunion completely.

'I announced in Perth that it was likely to be the last concert we would play and it still stands,' Jon said.

But there is definitely some wiggle room on that as Tim put it: 'Well, you're never going to get a definite no from us.'
