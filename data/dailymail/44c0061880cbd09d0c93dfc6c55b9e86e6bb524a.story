Chelsea are a step closer to announcing the £35million signing of Diego Costa before the World Cup after the striker passed his medical.

Jose Mourinho's move for the Spain international is now virtually complete, having been held up by the striker's hamstring injury.

Personal terms with Costa have already been agreed, but his hamstring complaint had delayed the player's transfer before he passed his medical on Spain duty in Barcelona.
