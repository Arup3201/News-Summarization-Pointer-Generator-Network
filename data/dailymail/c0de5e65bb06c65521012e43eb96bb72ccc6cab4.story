The effect of global warming may be unavoidable, but it can be hard to comprehend from the comfort of our homes.

However, it becomes painfully clear in this stunning set of images, showing some of the regions most at risk: The Arctic and Antarctica. 

Photographer Camille Seaman has been travelling to areas near both poles for more than a decade, capturing the lives of polar bears and penguins and the melting ice shelves.

California-based Ms Seaman, 45, also visited Alaska, Greenland, Svalbard, Arctic Russia and Arctic Norway in order to capture what she described as 'the beauty, but also sadness' of the areas.

The works feature in her latest book, Melting Away, which she has been working on since 2003, and  hopes will help highlight the delicacy of the areas , by drawing  attention to the consequences of global warming. 

Ms Seaman said: 'I want people to have a personal moment with the images. Some feel fear, or awe, others see beauty and sadness.

'I want them to feel something that will hopefully inspire the start of a relationship with this planet. The images have a range of responses - some still do not think climate change is anything we should be concerned with.

'Others are thankful I have shown them something they might not ever witness themselves.'
