The U.S. is being flooded with cheap heroin from Mexico as farmers in the country find that their traditional cannabis crop is no longer as profitable north of the border.

Mexican campesinos are turning away from growing marijuana after decriminalisation of the drug in many American states has led to steep falls in its wholesale price.

Instead they are filling their fields with opium poppies, a crop more commonly associated with Asia, which offers them a far greater return on their efforts.

It comes as demand in the U.S. for 
hard drugs increases, spurred by a crackdown on prescription painkiller 
abuse which has made pills such as OxyContin more difficult to obtain.

Rodrigo Silla, 50, a 
lifelong marijuana farmer from Mexico's Sinoloa state, told the 
Washington Post that growing the pungent-smelling herb was simply 'not 
worth it any more.'

'I wish the Americans would stop with this legalisation,' he said.

For decades a scourge of the back alleys of American life, heroin is once again spreading across the country.

The
 death of the Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman in February only underscored a 
problem many American communities were already facing, the rising use of
 - and deaths from - heroin.

Once
 mainly a city phenomenon, the drug has spread - gripping postcard 
villages in Vermont, middle-class enclaves outside Chicago and other 
places.

Cocaine, 
painkillers and tranquillizers are all used more than heroin, and the 
latest federal overdose statistics show that in 2010 the vast majority 
of drug overdose deaths involved pharmaceuticals, with heroin accounting
 for less than 10 per cent.

But
 heroin's escalation is troubling. Last month, U.S. Attorney General 
Eric Holder called the 45 per cent increase in heroin overdose deaths 
between 2006 and 2010 an 'urgent and growing public health crisis.'

In
 2007, there were an estimated 373,000 heroin users in the U.S. By 2012,
 the number was 669,000, with the greatest increases among those 18 to 
25.

First-time users nearly doubled in a six-year period ending in 2012, from 90,000 to 156,000.

Experts
 claim that many users turned to heroin after a crackdown made 
prescription drug painkillers such as OxyContin harder to find and more 
costly.

It can kill when the drug is extremely pure or laced with other powerful narcotics.
 That, coupled with a low tolerance once people start using again after 
treatment, is catching addicts off guard.

In
 the Cleveland area, heroin-related overdoses killed 195 people last 
year, shattering the previous record. Some Ohio police chiefs say heroin
 is easier for kids to get than beer.

In
 Vermont, the governor devoted his entire State of the State speech this
 year to heroin, which threatens to overwhelm courts with related crime.

And this month, 
Massachusetts' governor declared a public health emergency over heroin 
and opiate abuse, directing that first responders be equipped with an 
overdose antidote.

Overall,
 use of the drug is believed to have increased 79 per cent 
between 2007 and 2012, according to federal data cited by the Washington
 Post.

It claims 
that high-grade heroin is available across rural America for as little 
as $4 a hit, well undercutting the cost of prescription drugs that have 
long been the drug of choice in such areas.

That
 plummeting price, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, is 
down to a huge hike in heroin production in Mexico, now America's 
biggest source of the drug.

U.S. officials seized a record 2,162kg of heroin along the Mexican border last year, up from a mere 367kg in 2007.

Much
 of that is grown in Sinaloa, a state which has for decades been a giant
 drug farm and whose home-grown Sinaloa Cartel is now believed to 
control as much as half of the North American heroin market.

The
 surge in heroin hitting the U.S. market has been blamed at least partly
 on the fall in the profits available from the wholesale production of 
cannabis.

With new liberal 
legal regimes in 20 U.S. states and the District of Columbia more of 
domestic demand is being filled with strong, hydroponic varieties grown 
in converted warehouses.

That
 has led to a collapse in the price Mexican growers can charge for their
 marijuana crops, falling from $100 a kilo to less than $25 in the past 
five years.

Police in East Texas have arrested a woman after she called them to complain about the quality of the marijuana she had bought from a dealer.

Lufkin police Sergeant David Casper said yesterday that an officer went to the home of 37-year-old Evelyn Hamilton, above right, to hear her complaint that the dealer refused to return her money after she objected that the drug was substandard.

Casper says she pulled the small amount of marijuana from her bra when the officer asked if she still had it. She was arrested Friday on a charge of possession of drug paraphernalia.

Hamilton said Monday that she spent $40 on 'seeds and residue.' She says she called police when she got no satisfaction from the dealer's family.

Mexico 
researcher David Shirk, of the University of California at San Diego, 
told the Post that this collapse in price was leading Mexico's 
traditional marijuana farmers to diversify.

'The
 wave of opium poppies we’re seeing is at least partially driven by 
changes we’re making in marijuana drug policy,' he added.

The
 going rate for a kilogram of raw opium sap in the Sierra Madre is 
$1,500 - nearly double its 2012 price - growers told the Washington 
Post. Farmers can produce nearly eight kilos of that sap per acre, given
 favourable weather, enough for a kilo of heroin that can reach a 
wholesale price in the U.S. of a staggering $80,000.

But what's good for the farmers is proving catastrophic for addicts in the U.S.

On
 a beautiful Sunday last October, Detective Dan Douglas stood in a 
suburban Minnesota home and looked down at a lifeless 20-year-old - a 
needle mark in the man's arm, a syringe in his pocket.

Fresh
 out of treatment, this man was Douglas' second heroin overdose that 
day. 'You just drive away and go, 'Well, here we go again,'' the veteran
 cop told the Associated Press.

In
 Butler County, Ohio, responding to heroin overdose calls is so common 
that the EMS coordinator likens it to 'coming in and eating breakfast - 
you just kind of expect it to occur.' A local rehab facility has a 
six-month wait.

One school 
recently referred an 11-year-old boy. 'There are so many residual 
effects,' the sheriff there says. 'And we're all paying for it.'

Even for those growing it, like Rodrigo Silla, the new crop is fraught with danger.

Blooming
 radiant purple, red and white, the poppies are easily spotted from the 
air. Last month the Mexican army roared in jeeps into his farm, seized 
his crop and destroyed his equipment.

Nevertheless, he adds: 'There’s no other way to make a living here.'
