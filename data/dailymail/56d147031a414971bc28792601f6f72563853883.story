Primary school children as young as four were banned from saying goodbye to their parents in the playground for 'health and safety reasons'.

Parents say pupils  at Forster Park Primary School in Catford, south London, have been left 'inconsolable' by the 'big change'.

The school sent out letters to parents this week saying they were 'banned' from the entering the playground, from where they were previously allowed to wave off their children.

Parents have been stopped from saying goodbye to their children in the school playground at Forster Park Primary School in Catford, south London, pictured above, for health and safety reasons 

The letter says parents should say goodbye at the school gate, adding: 'From tomorrow morning (Thursday), we are asking for parents not to enter the playground and to say goodbye to their children at the school gate.

'This is for health and safety reasons. We know that this is a big change but we know that you will work with us to ensure that the start of the school day is even better than it is already.

'Arrangements for collecting your children at the end of the day will remain unchanged, meaning that parents come onto the school playground as you do already.' 

A spokesman for Lewisham Council said the new rule was to minimise disruption caused by 'extensive building work' which is currently going on at the 500-pupil school.

But the school said this afternoon that it was now working to provide parents with an alternative place to drop their children off, starting from next week. 

One mother, who asked not to be named, said her five-year-old daughter was left 'inconsolable' as she was led off into the school without a 'proper goodbye'.

She said: 'My daughter was quite anxious about going to school and suffers from separation anxiety, so it is important for me to be able to say goodbye to her properly.

'Instead, we were told not to stray past the school gates, so I ended up watching her being led away in tears while I stood watching, in tears myself.'

Michala Cohen told News Shopper that her five-year-old daughter Tymisha was 'really upset' while other children were 'hysterical' about not being able to give their parents a kiss and cuddle.

The 23-year-old said: 'My daughter would not leave my side and was really upset. Lots of the other kids were hysterical as well.

'Normally she's a really happy girl and actually skips into school but she wasn't comfortable with this whatsoever.

'The kids are used to their mums taking them in and kissing them goodbye so today was heartbreaking not being able to do that.'

School head Mark Gale had said the 'priority' was to ensure the health and safety of the pupils and said the new routine was a 'smoother way' to start the day in the new term. 

He said all decisions were made in the best interests of pupils and that he would be monitoring the new arrangements.

He later added: 'The school has had some major building works over the summer and a number of classrooms have been repositioned.

'It was clear on the first morning back that the old arrangements for dropping off children were no longer suitable and were creating a confused and an unsafe situation.

'I am working with parents to find a better, smoother way to drop children off. We have further works at the school over the weekend and we will be amending our arrangements, taking into account feedback from parents, which will allow parents to use a part of the playground to drop off their children.

'It was never our intention to cause any distress to children and parents of Forster Park.' 

The letter was sent by Mr Gale on the first day of his job. He wrote: 'I would also like to say how impressed I am with the children of Forster Park; they all look so smart ad ready for learning.

'I am so proud of them, and it's only my first day here. Thank you for sending in such smart children.'

He also raises another health and safety issue in the letter, telling parents that birthday cake will not be given out on the pupils' birthdays.

He said: 'Due to allergies I am afraid that we cannot give out birthday cake, party bags or anything else on birthdays.

'However, we will do everything we can to make sure that your child's birthday is acknowledged and that they have an especially enjoyable day.

'I appreciate that these are quite big changes, but as ever, we are putting the children and their safety first.'
