This adorable and incredibly happy Labrador retriever is living up to its reputation. 

And it appears Stella the dog is not missing summer as she shows just how much fun autumn can be as she plays a game of fetch.

With nearly half a million YouTube views, this video recorded by her American owner, Jodie Hartman, captures the crowd-pleasing moment that Stella repeatedly leaps into a giant pile of leaves to retrieve her beloved yellow toy.

Rest: Stella stops unusually by collapsing on the grass with the ball in her mouth

Stella barks at her owner in excitement and then launches herself into the leaves - like a child jumping into a swimming pool - as the ball disappears. 

Moments later she somehow emerges with the ball in her mouth and is ready for another round.

Even though it's like finding a needle in a haystack, the determined and dedicated dog manages to retrieve the ball on every occasion.

The cute canine always emerges from the leaves happily wagging her tail and revelling in her accomplishment. 

Ready: Stella the Labrador looks up excitedly towards the tennis ball as Jodie Hartman prepares to throw it

Leaves: The dog jumps enthusiastically into the giant pile of leaves as she looks for the ball

Challenge: Stella always emerges happily wagging her tail after she retrieves the ball

Vanished: It looks like Stella is nowhere to be seen as she searches for the ball under the leaves

But Stella eventually gets tuckered out and shows off the unusual way that she takes a rest. It appears that her back legs give out and she drags herself, but her owner says it is normal and she is a healthy dog.

To address any concerns, Ms Hartman said Stella has no medical issues whatsoever and is in great shape.

'[Stella] is a perfectly healthy yellow lab with no medical issues at all,' she wrote online.

'She has been tested for EIC [exercise-induced collapse], and her funny way of stopping is just how she cools down on the grass.'
