Ed Miliband was branded the SNP's poodle yesterday – as Alex Salmond boasted he would install the Labour leader in No10.

In a second pink champagne-fuelled interview in consecutive days, the former SNP leader pledged to 'lock David Cameron out of Downing Street' if the election produces a hung parliament.

Mr Salmond said the SNP would back Labour regardless of any formal deal, but said his party would make 'progressive amendments' to the Budget and other legislation – code for higher taxes and Left-wing policies.

The Prime Minister seized on the comments in the Commons, describing Mr Miliband as 'Alex Salmond's poodle'.

'As far as I can see, Alex Salmond has taken the entire Labour Party hostage and today we have got the ransom note,' he said. 

'And the ransom note is very clear. It says higher borrowing, uncontrolled immigration, unfettered welfare, higher taxes and weaker defence.

'That's what is being demanded and the British people have only one way of saying no to this appalling hostage situation – and that is to vote Conservative on May 7.'

Mr Salmond's latest intervention also appeared to irritate the SNP's new leader Nicola Sturgeon.

As her predecessor stole her limelight again, Scotland's First Minister attempted to stamp her authority on the party, insisting: 'I'm the leader of the SNP.' 

In an interview with the Spectator magazine – during which he guzzled pink champagne for a second consecutive day – Mr Salmond said his MPs would vote to kick out the Tories whether they secure concessions from Labour or not.

'The SNP approach to a Cameron minority government will be to bring it down,' he said. In an interview with the New Statesman the previous day, Mr Salmond again ordered a bottle of pink champagne, ostensibly to celebrate the publication of his book on last year's referendum campaign.

Mr Salmond, who also revealed that he 'identifies' with Nelson Mandela, said the SNP would join forces with Labour to vote down any Queen's Speech put forward by a minority Conservative government. 

The SNP is riding high in the polls and experts predict the party could win as many as 50 of Scotland's 59 seats, making it potentially the third biggest party at Westminster.

Labour will 'redistribute' hundreds of millions of pounds from England to Scotland if it wins the election, the party's leader north of the border boasted yesterday.

Jim Murphy pledged in a speech in the City of London to use money raided from the pensions of better-off workers in England to pay for a 'jobs guarantee' for young people in Scotland, and higher bursaries for Scottish students.

Mr Murphy has already angered voters in England by boasting that he will use the proceeds of a mansion tax in the South East to pay for an extra 1,000 nurses in Scotland.

A Scottish Labour source said that, unlike the SNP, it could promise to raise taxes in England and spend them in Scotland. 'This announcement means two of Scottish Labour's first three election pledges will be funded by money raised from the more prosperous parts of the UK.'

Mr Salmond, who is expected to return to Westminster as an MP in May in the hope of being kingmaker, said the party that holds the balance of power 'holds the power'.

The Conservatives are set to make the threat of a Labour/SNP government a major campaign issue in England.

The party has already mocked up a poster showing a tiny Mr Miliband in Mr Salmond's pocket.

And sources point out that the SNP has previously set out a string of ruinously high demands, including £180billion of extra borrowing, ditching Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent, increased immigration and billions more in benefits.

Labour yesterday seized on Mr Salmond's admission that the SNP will back the party in government even if it cannot get a formal deal. Tom Harris, MP for Glasgow South, said Mr Salmond has 'dispensed with his last bargaining point'.

'They have nothing to offer us and they have no threats to make that are remotely realistic.'

Labour's Scottish leader Jim Murphy described Mr Salmond as 'David Cameron's little helper'. 

In an interview with LBC radio, he conceded that the opinion polls are 'bloody awful for Labour'.

A YouGov poll revealed that Miss Sturgeon is the most popular party leader. It gave her an approval rating of plus five. Mr Cameron was minus five, Mr Miliband minus 39 and Nick Clegg minus 47.
