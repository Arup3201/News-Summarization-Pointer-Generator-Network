Roberto Martinez is refusing to give up on a top-four place despite his Everton team crashing to a disappointing defeat against Southampton.

An own goal from Romelu Lukaku in the first half, Graziano Pelle’s close-range strike and a goal scored by Maya Yoshida’s shoulder humiliated Everton and ended Southampton’s five-game losing streak.

The loss left Everton 10th in the table and 10 points behind West Ham in fourth place, but Martinez is adamant that they are very much in the race for a Champions League place.

‘The league is more open than it was the last campaign,’ Martinez said. ‘I must admit that at this stage you could feel the first three positions were taken but I don’t think that is the case.

‘Southampton and West Ham have been the best teams for me this season when you look at how they have performed. That opens a real competitive edge in the top six.

‘Spurs and Arsenal are there. I still think there are a lot of points to fight for. There are a lot of teams who are going to get a lot of points from each other.

‘From our point of view it is about getting a good run of results, making sure we reach a good level of performance and we try and get into the final third of the season with an opportunity to finish as high as we can.

‘The result against Southampton is a real disappointment, don’t get me wrong, but I think we need to see through what we can achieve after that disappointment.’

Everton have struggled for consistency this season. Following their convincing win against Queens Park Rangers a week ago, after four games without a victory, a defeat so heavy to Southampton in their dire form was unexpected.

Martinez is under no illusions that Chelsea and Manchester City are fighting it out for the title but he insists that a whole host of teams, including his own, are in contention for the other Champions League places.

‘I do think that Manchester City and Chelsea are a step ahead of everybody else,’ he admitted. ‘After that I do think that any team can go into a very good run and finish the season strong.

‘The league is getting more competitive every time and everybody can take points off of anyone. I do think that West Ham and Southampton have had a really strong start that will mean a lot of teams will lose points against them.

‘I still think that Liverpool will have a revival and obviously teams like Spurs, Arsenal, Manchester United that they are built to win things and to finish in the Champions League that will open the league up if you can find a good run of results and form you can always sneak in.

‘That’s what we are trying to do. Win as many points as we can and we’ll see where that can take us.’
