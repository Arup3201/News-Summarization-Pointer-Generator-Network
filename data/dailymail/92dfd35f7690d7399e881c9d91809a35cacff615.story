In the past eight editions of the Champions League since 2007 there have been seven different winners but coached by only six talented men. 

The attraction of this week’s return to elite European football is that all four of those six winning coaches who remain active — Sir Alex Ferguson and Jupp Heynckes having retired — are immediately on Champions League duty. 

Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti — the two repeat winners with Barcelona (2009 and 2011) and AC Milan/Real Madrid (2007 and 2014) — face tantalising ties against familiar rivals. 

Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola faces tantalising tie against Shakhtar Donetsk

Their teams — Bayern and Madrid — deserve to be two of the firmest favourites to reach the Berlin Final, but dealing equally firmly with Shakhtar Donetsk and Schalke will be a task. 

Perhaps Jose Mourinho (winner with Inter, 2010) faces the match of the week, a proper test of Chelsea’s mettle in France against Paris Saint-Germain Meanwhile, Roberto di Matteo goes Italian v Italian as he tries to get Schalke to obliterate the 6-1 home defeat suffered against Ancelotti’s Real en route to the Spanish club winning this trophy a year ago. 

The di Matteo v Ancelotti battle is fascinating. They both played for a Roman team — AS Roma and Lazio. They both lifted UEFA silverware as midfielders. Both gave dignity and sweat to the Italian national team (just over 50 caps between them).

Di Matteo played for Chelsea, both men coached that club and won trophies for the Romans’ empire. But there’s a separation, too. Ancelotti was born in the footballing heart of northern Italy. 

Di Matteo was born and raised in Switzerland. Some notional ‘background GPS’ isn’t detectably the reason for this, but Ancelotti is markedly thought of as the greater player. Was he a better footballer than di Matteo? That’s arguable. 

But the elder man had the good fortune to play in exceptional teams — principally Arrigo Sacchi’s Milan. Ancelotti was the axis around which a great deal of creativity and improvisation throbbed. Something which makes the lack of such a player in his current Real Madrid squad, since Xabi Alonso was sold, all the more irrational. 

Where di Matteo had great fortune was in inheriting a good group of players at Chelsea, a group which had started to lose patience under Andre Villas-Boas, but which had lost neither their talent or competitive edge. Ancelotti and di Matteo, who took the Schalke reins in October, have only competed head-to-head once before — on the opening day of the Premier League season in 2010. 

The 6-0 hiding which Ancelotti’s Chelsea gave West Brom hinted at a series of setback results, around the turn of the year, which saw di Matteo out of his job by February 2011. 

A mere 15 months later, di Matteo was dancing up the centre-stand steps at the AllianzArena in Munich, shouting to Roman Abramovich: ‘I won it!’ and lifting the Champions League trophy.

The win had been fuelled by six of the same players — Petr Cech, John Obi Mikel, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Florent Malouda and Didier Drogba — who had made his opening Premier League day with West Brom miserable. Di Matteo’s four-leaf clover when he took over at Chelsea was that Drogba, Terry, Lampard and Cech weren’t finished with the Champions League. 

However well he coached, they were footballers cut from the rock of ages. And they hadn’t stopped rocking. If he has a similarly-leaved lucky flora right now, it’s that this is exactly the right moment to face Real. Ancelotti admitted this weekend: ‘Since we won the world title in December, we have dropped our intensity and concentration.’ 

They keep dropping important players, too. Pepe might make it back for this match in Gelsenkirchen but that would constitute his first game in more than a month. Sergio Ramos, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez will all be missing — but it is the missing form of Ronaldo and Gareth Bale which is less finite and less easy to define or cure. Schalke may have been whipped 6-1 when Madrid last came to town. But this isn’t nearly the same demolishing machine. 

Real have looked mentally fatigued, less focused and without the claws which they used to savage both Schalke and Bayern in Germany last season — scoring 10 and conceding just once.

Di Matteo’s team isn’t identical to a year ago. But their recent 1-1 draw with Guardiola’s Bayern — a notable enough result given that it is the second time they have drawn wi th the reigning German champions this season — featured Benedikt Höwedes, Christian Fuchs, Joel Matip, Max Meyer, Kevin- Prince Boateng, and Roman Neustädter from the side that shipped six to Los Blancos. 

The Italian has made Schalke much more ordered, harder to beat and, until Klaas-Jan Huntelaar got himself banned for four games for a horrible foul on Manuel Schmiedebach, sharp up front. He has promoted from within, giving debuts to young goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther in that draw with Bayern and Marvin Friedrich, a highly promising 19-year-old central defender. 

What di Matteo needs to use as his winning card, as far as the Schalke squad is concerned, is that Madrid’s form in Germany last season was the exception, not the rule. 

Real are on a nine-match winning streak in the Champions League, scoring 25 goals and conceding three. But prior to those two big wins in Germany last season, they had won just one of 25 away matches against Bundesliga sides — meaning their current domestic form isn’t quite how they would like to ‘present’. 

According to Madrid’s B-team coach, Zinedine Zidane, it’s a threatening tie. ‘I would like to say that Schalke has no chance and Real will safely reach the quarter-finals,’ he told Die Welt. ‘But in the knockout phase, anything can happen. In two games, you have double the chance of an outsider playing above themselves.

So a team like ours must always be cautious, especially against Germans.’ Wise words. But he forgot to warn Ancelotti and Co to check if di Matteo is sporting a four-leaf clover in his lapel.
