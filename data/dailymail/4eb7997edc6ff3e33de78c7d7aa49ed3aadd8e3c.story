Apprentice winner Stella English has told how she has lost everything over her court battle with TV boss Lord Alan Sugar.

The mother-of-two who once thought nothing of paying £200 on a bottle of champagne, claimed she has only £90 in the bank.

Ms English also revealed:.

She said: 'I'm being treated like a criminal. I can't work, I've been  called awful things, my marriage has broken down. I'm on my knees.'

Before landing a £100,000 job with Lord Sugar when she won the 2010 BBC series, she worked as a £80,000-a-year bank trader.

She enjoyed a luxury lifestyle with £600 meals of lobster and caviar, £300 designer shoes and three homes reportedly worth £1million.

Land Registry deeds 
are said to reveal Miss English bought the first flat in 2005 for £250,000 and the
second for £245,000 in 2007. Both were expected to be worth more now.

Former Apprentice winner Stella English said she had fallen into poverty at a tribunal last week. It has now been reported she spends up to £4,000 a month on PR

But now she claims her riverside flat 
has been repossessed and her two other properties in south London are 
fully remortgaged and the 'banks own them.'

In an interview with the Sunday People,
she said she is struggling to survive, making packed school lunches for
her children, Edward, 7, and five-year-old Frank, and may have to ask 
friends for cash handouts.

'I wish I could sell the houses but they are not an asset they are a liability,' said Miss English, who rents a home in Whitstable, Kent.

She said she had been shouted at and abused by drunken teens while walking with her young sons on a beach near her home.

One of the youths spat at her while the other called her a 'gold digger. 'I was begging for them to leave us alone. I managed to get away.'

She revealed her husband Ray, a plumber, walked out on her blaming the show and the pressures of her court battle with Lord Sugar whom she had sued for alleged constructive dismissal after leaving his company.

Last week a judge ruled she would not have to pay the legal costs after losing the case. But the case cost her a £200,000 a year consultant job with Citigroup because of the media furore.

She has since applied for four jobs but hasn't heard back from the companies. 'As soon as the employer realises who I am I don't hear back,' she said

Miss English wept
when an East London Tribunal Service panel ruled that she should not 
have to repay any of the money.

Miss English said she had fallen into poverty and was trying to claim benefits as she fought off a claim by Lord Sugar, who was trying to win £35,000 in legal costs and damages

She told the tribunal: ‘I cannot afford to feed my kids let 
alone pay the mortgage – that doesn’t even matter any more,’ she said. 
‘It is my son’s birthday today but I can’t afford to buy him anything 
because everything we have goes on trying to survive.

‘A couple of weeks ago I made an application for housing benefit and there is an interview set up. I have no choice.

'Unless I find a contract I will not be able to support my family any more, I am losing close to £3k a month.

At
the original employment tribunal, Lord Sugar claimed Miss English 
knowingly lied when she said the £100,000-a-year job at his firm was a sham. 

At the original employment tribunal, Lord Sugar claimed Miss English knowingly lied when she said the £100,000-a-year job at his firm, which she won through the BBC programme in 2010, was a sham

Lawyers for 66-year-old Lord Sugar 
insisted Miss English brought the original legal action against him 
simply because she was ‘bored’ with her day job and missed the glamour 
of appearing on television.

But
tribunal judge George Foxwell rejected his application to recover some 
of his costs, saying that Miss English truly believed she had a case.

Last week it was reported she paid PR firm Big Talent Group up to £4,000 a month to manage her public relations, according to The Mirror.

Senior talent agent Terry Mills, of Big Talent Group, declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
