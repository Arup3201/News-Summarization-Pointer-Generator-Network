The California man suspected of kidnapping a 16-year-old girl and murdering her mother and brother may be armed with homemade bombs and grenades and might have also rigged his car with explosive booby traps, police are warning.

The announcement comes as authorities say they have widened their search for James DiMaggio, 40, and Hannah Anderson, 16, to all of North America, as they admit they do not know where he could be.

Investigators believe DiMaggio has ditched his blue Nissan Versa as he fled San Diego County with Anderson.

'Working on the theory that he abandoned the car, we think there is a possibility that the car might be rigged,' San Diego County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Jan Caldwell told CNN.

Missing: Ethan Anderson, 8, and his sister Hannah, 16, have been missing since Sunday, when their mother's body was found in a burned down home. A second body at the scene could belong to Ethan, police said

Suspect: The body was found in the home of James DiMaggio, a family friend who police believe snatched Hannah. Friends said he had a crush on the 16-year-old girl, who did not like being alone with him

'So we want to put out there for 
civilian safety, for officer safety, if you see the car, do not approach
it but call law enforcement.'

Police fear DiMaggio is armed with other improvised explosives, as well, and could use them as weapons if confronted.

The manhunt was launched after the 
murdered body of Hannah's mother, 42-year-old Christina Anderson, was 
found at DiMaggio's burned home on Sunday night. A child's remains were found in the 
garage and are believed to by the body of Hannah's eight-year-old brother Ethan.

A source told the Los Angeles Times that investigators believe Christina was bludgeoned to death with a crowbar.

DiMaggio was described as being like an uncle to the children.

But Hannah's friend, Marissa Chavez, said 
Wednesday that DiMaggio had developed a crush on Hannah and told her that he would
date her if they were the same age.

'He
said he had a crush on her, but didn't mean it in an intimate way,' 
15-year-old Marissa Chavez told The San Diego Union-Tribune. 'He said, 
"If I was your age, I'd date you."'

Several reported sightings of 
DiMaggio's Nissan were made in northern California and southern Oregon 
earlier this week, leading investigators to initially believe that he 
was headed for the Canadian border.

Amber Alerts have been issued for California, Oregon and Washington. On Thursday, authorities added Nevada to the list.

'Basically the search area is the United States, Canada and Mexico,' Sheriff's Lieutenant Glenn Giannantonio told the Times.

'Basically the search area is North America.'

Canadian and Mexican border authorities are on the lookout for DiMaggio and his young hostage.

Authorities believe DiMaggio, an avid outdoorsman, could be hiding out in a campground or wilderness area.

Chavez, Hannah's friend, said she witnessed the 
exchange when DiMaggio was driving them 
home from a high school gymnastics meet.

Hannah asked Chavez to join her
from then on whenever DiMaggio drove her to meets because she was 
uncomfortable with the attention, according to Chavez.

'She was a little creeped out by it. She didn't want to be alone with him,' Chavez said.

She
also said that DiMaggio took her to Hollywood in late June or early 
July for her birthday, and that he cut the week-long trip short because he was 
upset that Hannah was paying more attention to her phone than to him.

'After that she never responded to his texts and e-mails,' Chavez told the San Diego newspaper.

DiMaggio was in a 'close platonic relationship' with Hannah, a sheriff’s statement said without further explanation.

Brett Anderson, Christina Anderson's husband and father to Hannah and Ethan, flew to San Diego Tuesday to be interviewed by investigators and to plead with DiMaggio to return his daughter safely.

'Jim,
I can't fathom what you were thinking. The damage is done,' he said 
outside San Diego County Sheriff's Department headquarters.

Addressing Hannah, he said he loves her very much and pleaded, 'if you have a chance, you take it. You run. You'll be found.' 

Sorrow: Their father, Brett Anderson, pleaded for the children's safe return at a candlelit vigil on Tuesday

Mr Anderson lives in Tennessee after moving away from the area for a job a few months ago.

On
Tuesday, Mr Anderson joined hundreds of family friends and neighbors at
a candlelight vigil in the parking lot of El Capitan High School in 
Lakeside, where Hannah was about to start her junior year.

Pink
paper cups stuffed between holes in the fence read 'Pray Hannah' and 
dozens of white, blue and pink balloons lifted into the air.

At the vigil, Mr Anderson and other family members address the large crowd.

'Hannah
will come back and Ethan and Tina, I love you both,' he said. 'We all 
love you. I know everybody’s here for support of all three of them and I
want to thank you all. God bless.'

Destroyed: The body of the children's mother, Christina, was found in DiMaggio's burned down house

The remains of a home owned by 40-year-old James Lee DiMaggio, a suspect in the murder of 2 people, is shown in the Boulevard neighborhood of San Diego County

Her Facebook page reveals a popular teenage girl with a passion for dance. She was also a gymnast on her high school team.

'You would never see her without a smile on her face,' said Marlee Friszell, 16, who attended Hannah's birthday party last week.

Ethan Anderson liked to play football and baseball and go fishing, neighbors said.

DiMaggio is believed to be driving a blue Nissan Versa with California license plate 6WCU986.

He is described as white, 5-feet-9-inches tall, weighing 150 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes, and is currently clean-shaved without the goatee beard seen in his photo.
