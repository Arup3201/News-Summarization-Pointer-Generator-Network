North Korea has called U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry a wolf with a 'hideous lantern jaw', in its latest insult on a prominent political figure.

The reclusive state has unleashed a slew of crude insults against leaders in Washington and Seoul this year, calling President Barack Obama a monkey and South Korean President Park Geun-hye a prostitute.

Today's slur against Mr Kerry appeared only in a Korean-language dispatch, suggesting it was meant to rally anti-U.S. sentiment and burnish the leadership's image domestically at a time when Washington and Seoul are conducting annual military drills that Pyongyang calls an invasion rehearsal.

North Korea has called U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry a wolf with a 'hideous lantern jaw'

An unidentified policy department spokesman at the North Korean defence commission, led by leader Kim Jong-un, described Mr Kerry as a 'wolf donning the mask of sheep'.

The spokesman criticised Mr Kerry for recently saying Washington wants to see peace on the Korean Peninsula, although the U.S. and South Korea then went ahead with their summertime drills that North Korea has demanded be scrapped. The U.S. and South Korea say the drills are defensive in nature.

The North Korean spokesman also criticised Kerry's comments on North Korea's human rights record and weapons programmes.

'His behaviour fully revealed once again the U.S. inveterate nature as a hypocrite who has deceived and mocked mankind with all sorts of gimmicks,' the spokesman said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.

South Korean and U.S. officials often criticise the North's critical language but stop short of similar rhetoric against North Korean leaders.

However conservative activists in South Korea frequently use images depicting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as a pig in anti-Pyongyang rallies.

Tension on the Korean Peninsula remains high as North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery test firings this year.
