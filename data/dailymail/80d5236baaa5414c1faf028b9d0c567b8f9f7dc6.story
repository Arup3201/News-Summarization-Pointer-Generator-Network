The defending all-around gold medalist and her family will be featured in a new Oxygen reality show debuting later this year.

The show, which will be co-produced by Douglas and her mother Natalie Hawkins among others, has the working title 'Douglas Family Gold.'

History: Gabrielle Douglas became the first African-American to win the all-around title when she soared to victory at the 2012 London Games. She and her mother Natalie Hawkins (seen right in September 2012) are producing the show 'Douglas Family Gold' 

The series will follow the 19-year-old's bid to become the first gymnast in nearly 50 years to repeat as Olympic champion.

Douglas became the first African-American to win the all-around title when she soared to victory at the 2012 London Games as part of the 'Fierce Five' that also won the team gold medal.

A release for the television program, via Deadline, says 'The bi-coastal Douglas family shuttles between California and Ohio to support Gabby’s training regimen while also juggling their own lives.

'Her brother John is the family's second Olympic hopeful in track and field, while devoted sisters Arie and Joy are eager to blaze their own paths.

'"Momager" Natalie keeps this tight-knit family in-check, knowing regardless of what happens, "Team Douglas" has already won gold.' 

Champions: Douglas (far left) was part of the 'Fierce Five' that won the 2012 Olympic team medal for gymnastics. Her team members (from left to right) included Kyla Ross, McKayla Maroney, Jordyn Wiber and Aly Raisman (September 2012 file photo)

Family: Douglas' siblings, including her sisters Arie and Joy and her brother John, are set to appear in the reality show program when it airs on Oxygen 

Douglas returned to training last summer and finished fourth at the Jesolo Cup in Italy last weekend in her first meet in nearly three years.

In a February 2015 video with USA Gymnastics, Douglas said 'A couple of months after the [2012] Olympics, I was like "I want to do it. I want to get back. And I'm going to go to 2016."

'What's driving me is - I guess 'cause no one's ever done it before. And that's definitely pushing me.'

Other American gymnasts who have won gold medals at the Olympics have appeared on reality television, namely ABC's 'Dancing with the Stars.'

Those include Shawn Johnson, who won gold at the Beijing Games in 2008 for the balance beam, and Aly Raisman, who won gold at the London Games in 2012 for floor. 

Nastia Liukin, who took the all-around gold medal home from Beijing in 2008, is currently competing on the dancing reality show competition.
