Louis van Gaal accused his team of lacking the killer instinct to win the title after United dropped their first points in almost two months in their 1-1 draw against ten-man Aston Villa. 

Radamel Falcao started his first game for United since early October and scored as United came from behind to earn a point – but couldn’t go on to seal the win, despite the 65th minute sending off of Gabriel Agbonlahor.

And Van Gaal, whose side has previously won six consecutive matches, said dropping points in game such as these could be the difference between mounting a serious title challenge or not.

Louis van Gaal believes Manchester United aren't capable of winning the Premier League title this season

‘I saw the first half of the Manchester City match and they could have been behind in the first five or ten minutes and they struggled until half time but at the end it is 3-0,’ said van Gaal. ‘That’s the difference.’

Asked if his side were capable of making a challenge for the Premier League title, van Gaal said: ‘No, because you have seen that you have to win these matches and we didn’t win. But there is still a long time to go. Chelsea has to at Stoke City, it’s not so easy.

‘We dropped two points. We were the better team and that’s frustrating when you don’t win these games. When you want to be a part of the title race then you have to win these games and I think also that we were not so aggressive in the first half as usual.

‘We kept the ball much better but we didn’t create so much because we were not looking to the forwards. That’s why I changed Darren Fletcher with Michael Carrick at half time, because I know he’s more a of a passer to the forwards.

‘But it was not good enough to get the victory here. We were not creative enough in the second half; we didn’t keep the ball as well as in the first half but we had more aggression. So that was the plus I think. 

'Ok we have a draw and that’s why I’m a little bit frustrated because we could have won this game, we didn’t do and we are responsible.’
