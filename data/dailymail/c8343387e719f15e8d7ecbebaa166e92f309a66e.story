Addressing a harsh backlash from lawmakers, Google is seeking to clarify ‘the real story’ about its controversial new privacy consolidation efforts that were launched earlier this week.

On Tuesday, the internet company announced it would collect data used as part of a new effort to make the consumer experience better by unifying 60 privacy policies.

But eight members of Congress fired back, sending a letter to Google expressing concern that the merging of information could make it more difficult for consumers to protect their privacy.

Streamlined experience: Google says its new condensed privacy policy allows for a better experience

‘While Google suggests that the purpose of this shift in policy is to make the consumer experience simpler, we want to make sure it does not make protecting consumer privacy more complicated,’ the letter to Google CEO Larry Page read.

Google, in a statement from policy manager Betsy Masiello, insisted on Thursday that users had 'choice and control.'

'We're not collecting more data about you. Our new policy simply makes it clear that we use data to refine and improve your experience on Google,' she wrote. 

'We're making things simpler and we're trying to be upfront about it. Period.'

She wrote the changes have been misunderstood. She said that users don’t have to be logged in to use Google search and YouTube.

When a consumer is not logged into Google, no data is collected.

She also said there are several 
privacy measures Google users can utilise, including ‘incognito mode’ on
Google Chrome and going ‘off the record’ on Gchat. 

Ms Masiello pointed out that one doesn’t have to use all of Google’s products.

Google, whose offerings include its flagship search product, Gmail, YouTube and Google+ products, said it would 'mean a simpler, more intuitive Google experience.'

Online privacy has come under scrutiny from Washington as a handful of web giants have been accused of compromising user privacy to attract advertisers.

Late last year, Facebook settled with the FTC agreeing to be regulated for a period of 20 years whenever it decides to change its privacy policy.

Some bloggers have compared the new privacy policies to George Orwell's 1984

In 2010, the FTC settled charges with 
Twitter, after the agency alleged that the social networking service had
failed to safeguard users' personal information.

U.S. regulators are reportedly looking into whether Google manipulates its search results to favour its own products and have expanded the probe to include Google+.

Twitter voiced a complaint that the enhanced new Search plus Your World – which includes information from a consumer’s personal Google+ page – because Twitter doesn’t allow Google’s algorithms to access the micro blogging site, the San Francisco Chronicle said.

Some bloggers have likened the changes to the Orwellian thriller 1984, which warns of the ever-present Big Brother, who monitored everybody's experiences.
