England's Kristian Thomas has claimed silver in the men's vault final on the final day of Commonwealth gymnastics action at the SSE Hydro.

Canada's Scott Morgan won gold with a total of 14.733, with a silver medal-winning score of 14.499 enough for Thomas while Singapore's Wah Toon Hoe took bronze with 14.195.

Each gymnast completed two vaults with the average of both scores calculated to form their total, but the first did not go to plan for top qualifier Thomas as he was unable to stick his dismount although he landed the second to total 14.499. He did however move ahead of Hoe, who was the first gymnast to compete.

Morgan, who won rings gold on Thursday, leapt into the lead with two impressive vaults - 14.766 and 14.700 - which combined for a 14.733 average that edged ahead of Thomas.

Scotland's Adam Cox, who is a primary school teacher and came out of gymnastics retirement to compete in Glasgow, was the next to vault but he did not hit the highs of his opponents and eventually finished the final in seventh place.

India's Ashish Kumar put himself in contention on vault one but landed on his back for the second and scored no points as rules state zero is awarded if a gymnast fails to land feet first.

Home favourite Frank Baines moved into fourth place with a 14.016 average leaving Thomas holding on to silver for England with two more men to compete.

Australia's Kent Pieterse edged Baines out of fourth before Singapore's Aizat Bin Muhammad Aljufri wrapped up the first final of the day leaving the podium places unchallenged.
