Steven Drake Jr., 29, has been jailed for posts allegedly inciting violence against police the same day two New York City officers were shot dead

A Facebook user from Pennsylvania has been jailed for posts allegedly inciting violence against police the same day two New York City officers were shot dead.

According to the Observer-Reporter, Steven Drake Jr., 29, was arrested last Wednesday in McDonald.

Among the profanity-laced comments he reportedly posted on December 20 were 'The police brought this on themselves! I say kill them all! Enough is enough.'

He apparently wrote similar remarks on his social media page the following day.

The statements came after Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley, 28, shot and killed New York City police officers Raphael Ramos and Wenjian Liu as they sat in their patrol car.

The Maryland man then turned the gun on himself.

Two hours before the incident, Brinsley had posted a picture of a gun on Instagram with the chilling message: 'I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today. They Take 1 Of Ours...

'Let's Take 2 of Theirs #ShootThePolice #RIPErivGardner (sic) #RIPMikeBrown. This May Be My Final Post. I'm Putting Pigs In A Blanket.' 

Tragically, Baltimore police had tried to apprehend Brinsley by alerting the NYPD after his morning shooting - but by the time a wanted flyer was issued, his attack was already under way. 

Police in Pennsylvania received an anonymous tip off about Drake's 'aggressive' Facebook posts, along with screenshots shortly after the New York slayings.

Apparently he said he 'often posts anti-police rhetoric' on his social media pages and was drunk while writing his latest commentary.

The Midway resident now faces a preliminary hearing on January 6 with charges including terroristic threats and disorderly conduct.

Online court records do not list an attorney for him.

Police say Drake acknowledged making the posts, which also referenced the recent police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City.
