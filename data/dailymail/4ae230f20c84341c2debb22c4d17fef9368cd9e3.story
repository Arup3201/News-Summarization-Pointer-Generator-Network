A twice-divorced couple who have now reunited claim the secret to their happy relationship is their vow to stay unmarried this time around.

Beverley Knott, 38, and Lee Stevens, 41, who have three children between them, have pledged to never marry again following two failed marriages to each other.

Ms Knott said: 'We feel very privileged to have lived through so much together and now be in a position where we know that marriage doesn’t work for us.

'We are soul mates and we are life partners. We’re just not meant to be married to each other.'

Beverley Knott, 38, and Lee Stevens, 41, who have divorced twice and are now back together, say the secret to their happy relationship is to remain unmarried this time

Ms Knott and Mr Stevens became a couple in 1998 after being introduced by friends.

Ms Knott, who has a daughter, Lexi, now 16, by a previous marriage, quickly fell for Mr Stevens’ charms and the pair married in September 1998, two months after Ms Knott discovered she was pregnant with their son Lewis. 

Ms Knott said married life soon brought unbearable pressures.

She said: 'I worked as a play leader for my local council right up until I was eight months pregnant, and went back to work in June 1999, two months after giving birth. It was too much and I got post-natal depression.

The pair reconciled and they remarried on September 12 2004, six years to the day after their first marriage

'I felt as if I was burdening everyone around me. Things were moving at a million miles an hour and I felt overwhelmed.

'I changed jobs and began working 40-hour weeks, which put a strain on everything. Me and Lee became very distant. Life was just about bills and nappies.

'To get a bit of relief from the pressure I started going out with friends without Lee and that led to very brief affair with another man which only lasted a few months. I told Lee about it straight away and we started a divorce.'

Ms Knott and Mr Lee split was finalised in the winter of 2003.

Ms Knott said: 'I realised quickly that I’d made a big mistake. I knew I would never get over Lee - never get past him. He would always be there.

'He was a great dad, a good man and we had lots of fun. We had just lost our way somewhere.'

The pair reconciled and they remarried on September 12 2004, six years to the day after their first marriage.

A year later, Ms Knott gave birth to their second son, Joshua, now 8.

But once again, the pressures of raising a small child brought with it challenges and the pair, of Kidderminster, began to drift apart again.

Bev and Lee, pictured at their second wedding in September 2004, say walking down the aisle just doesn't work for them. 'Our attitude is that marriage is just a piece of paper at the end of the day', they say

Ms Knott said: 'I decided not to go back to work and at home I became a different person. We were rowing over money and raising he children. Had I gone back to work, I might have been able to cope with things but being at home I turned in on myself.

'Things went seriously downhill. At one point Lee came home and said he’d met someone else.'

By the spring of 2009, Mr Stevens, who works in car manufacturing, had minimal contact with Ms Knott and was seeing the three children through a contact centre.

'I was heartbroken,' said Ms Knott. 'The only way forward was to arrange things so I didn’t see Lee at all, so together we arranged to do things through a contact centre.

'The distance really helped. I moved to a new address and felt my emotions heal. For the first time in a very long time, I felt like myself again.

'I surprised myself by opening back up to Lee. I asked him out for a drink. It was like old times.

'He told me he thought he had made a mistake leaving our relationship and we got back together.'

By the time the second set of divorce papers arrived in June 2010, they knew they would never be happy as a married couple.

Ms Knott said: 'It was an opportunity to start again, with a clean slate, so we both signed the divorce papers and were happy when we did.

'We know we can’t be married - it just doesn’t work for us. But we’re incredibly happy together.

'We’ve become a lot more mature through our experiences and are aware now when things aren’t going as we want them to. We are able to recognise the signs and address the problems.'

Despite being unmarried, the two remain each other’s next of kin

Ms Knott, who now works as an Avon representative, said: 'We’ve heard people wonder what it’s been like for our children, but they are happy that we’re happy. They’d rather us be happy and unmarried than miserable and married.

'We all love each other, just the same.'

Mr Stevens said: 'I’ve known marriage to change people - we’re not the only ones who have experienced this situation.

'I’ve known quite a few couples who have seen things go downhill as soon as they’ve put rings on their fingers.

'It’s horses for courses - the important thing is what makes you happy.

'I respect people who consider marriage to be very important. My parents were happily married for 47 years before my father sadly passed away ten years ago.

'Going down the aisle just doesn’t work for us. It puts unnecessary pressure on people. Our attitude is that marriage is just a piece of paper at the end of the day.'
