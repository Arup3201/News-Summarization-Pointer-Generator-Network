The son of American evangelist Benny Hinn was arrested in Brazil after allegedly beating up a deaf and dumb man during one of his father's rallies, it was reported today.

Hestephenson Araujo, 21, reportedly needed hospital treatment after the incident on Saturday night during a religious crusade in Manaus, northern Brazil.

Police detained Joshua Hinn, 21, along with two of Benny Hinn's bodyguards, on suspicion of torture after the three men allegedly locked Mr Araujo in a trailer and physically assaulted him.

According to police, Mr Araujo, a local pastor, was sitting in the front row of seats at the event, in the city's Povos da Amazonia arena when, during Mr Hinn's sermon, he got up and approached the stage.

Mr Araujo, who was carrying a bottle of water, later said he only wanted to receive a blessing from the famous evangelist, who claims he can heal the sick.

But he was allegedly pounced on by Mr Hinn's son Joshua and two bodyguards, Caleb Shirk, 26, and Konstantins Konstantinovs, 34, who claimed they thought he was about to throw water at the preacher, who is worth an estimated £27 million ($42 million).

The men took Mr Araujo to a trailer parked near the stage where they allegedly held him captive inside, beating and punching him as they demanded to know who he was.

Because the man could not hear or respond to their demands, the physical aggression continued, police said.

Tactical squad officers burst into the trailer after concerned members of the public called police.

Mr Araujo was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where he received medical treatment and was later released.

The men reportedly claimed they didn't know that Mr Araujo was deaf and dumb and wanted to know why he had approached Benny Hinn during his sermon.

According to police, Mr Araujo's father, a sign language translator, entered into an agreement with Benny Hinn's representatives to not press charges against the men.

Police sources told Brazilian website Portal do Holanda that the agreement involved a "large sum of money".

The Civil Police said an investigation will still be launched into the incident.

After being released, Joshua Hinn and the two bodyguards reportedly continued to Manaus' international airport from where they flew directly back to the US.
