Hours before flying to Washington to try to scuttle an emerging US nuclear deal with Tehran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a high-profile visit  to Jerusalem's sacred Western Wall.

Wearing a black skullcap, he rested his hands on the Wall on Saturday while praying briefly, before he made remarks expressing his respect for US President Barack Obama.

This is amid tensions with the White House caused by his acceptance of an invitation by Republicans to speak on Tuesday at Capitol Hill, as Netanyahu stands firm on his bid to persuade Congress to fight Obama's Iran plans.

Hours before flying to Washington to try to scuttle an emerging US nuclear deal with Tehran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a high-profile visit to Jerusalem's sacred Western Wall (above pictured on Saturday in Jerusalem at the holy prayer site)

Wearing a black skullcap, he rested his hands on the Wall (above) while praying briefly, before he expressed his respect for US President Barack Obama. This is amid tensions caused by his acceptance of an invitation by Republicans to speak on Tuesday at Capitol Hill

'I want to take this opportunity to say that I respect US President Barack Obama,' he said. 

'I believe in the strength of the relations between Israel and the United States. That strength will prevail over differences of opinion, those in the past and those yet to come.'

Netanyahu's visit to the Western Wall is his first to the sacred site before a US trip since he became prime minister for the second time in 2009, according to The Jerusalem Post. It was followed by a visit to his father's grave two days prior.

The Prime Minister said his father, Benzion, who passed away in 2012 and often gave him advice during crucial moments in his life, told him to 'always look at the threats endangering our people'.

Netanyahu reiterated that in his position as prime minister, it is his job to be concerned about Israel's security, and to also identify dangers in time and do whatever possible to try to stop them from occurring.

Netanyahu said: 'As prime minister of Israel it is my duty to care for the security of Israel.

'That is why we strongly oppose the agreement emerging between Iran and the world powers which could endanger our very existence.' 

The Prime Minister referred to previous leaders, David Ben-Gurion, Levi Eshkol, and Menachem Begin, who he said all took action when they believed it to be necessary, even though they went against strongly-stated US policies.

His planned speech has caused 34 Democrats (30 House Members and four Senators), including Vice President Joe Biden, to boycott his speech during the joint session of Congress next week, according to CNN.

The Israeli Prime Minister said that he 'respects President Obama' and that he 'believes in the strength of the relations between Israel and the US' (above President Obama)

But even a Republican is planning to miss the speech as US Representative Jan Schakowsky released a statement on Thursday and said she will also not be in attendance.

Schakowsky, the only Jewish member of Illinois' Congressional delegation, said she agrees with the criticism of Republican House Speaker John Boehner's decision to invite Netanyahu without consulting Obama, according to The Chicago Tribune.

She also reportedly said she is more concerned about his speech scuttling negotiations with Iran to stop it from building a nuclear weapon.

And earlier this week, National Security Adviser Susan Rice came out saying the Prime Minister's decision to give the speech 'was destructive to the fabric of the relationship' between the US and Israel.

Netanyahu is set to give his speech on Tuesday at 11am, which will be followed by lunch with a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders before he returns to Israel. 

Secretary of State John Kerry will leave at the weekend for Switzerland for another meeting with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif.

The pace and intensity of the talks have increased as global powers gathered under the P5+1, a group of six world leaders, have sought a deal with Iran to stop it acquiring a nuclear weapon - something Tehran denies trying to do.

A March 31 deadline for a political framework for the deal is looming, with negotiators saying they will aim to pin down the final technical details by June 30.

Israel believes the sides are likely to reach an agreement that eases international sanctions on the Islamic republic without applying sufficiently stringent safeguards to stop it developing nuclear weapons.

During his US visit, the Prime Minister, who arrives on Sunday accompanied with his wife and top advisers, will also give a speech at American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference on Monday.

Netanyahu's trip to Washington comes two weeks before Israel's March 17 general election in which he is seeking a third consecutive term in office.
