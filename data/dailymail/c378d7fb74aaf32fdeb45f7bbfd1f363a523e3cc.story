It was back to school for Spain's Queen Letizia today as she welcomed students from Madrid's Francisco de Vitoria University to the Zarzuela Palace.

The 41-year-old was glamorous in a neat pink cardigan, floral skirt and a pair of her trademark court shoes - a look that was a far cry from the scruffier get-ups that dominated her student days.

Spain's new queen boasts not one but two degrees: the first in journalism from the Complutense University of Madrid and the second a master's course in the same subject from the University of Guadalajara in Mexico.

Elegant: Queen Letizia was glamorous in pink as she welcomed students to the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid

During her time in Mexico, Letizia combined her studies with a job selling cigarettes - a fact recently revealed by a set of intriguing old photographs released to newspapers last week.

Dressed in a pair of high-waisted denim jeans, an unflattering baggy shirt and carrying a large red bag, the ensemble was a far cry from the glamorous wardrobe she enjoys today.

Letizia studied in Mexico after completing a course in journalism in the early 1990s at the University Complutense of Madrid.

After spending time in Guadalajara in the mid-90s, she returned to Spain, where before meeting Prince Felipe, she worked as a newsreader for CNN.

She later went on to become the main anchor on Spain's TVE news programme, which led her to meeting her future husband.

That husband, the newly crowned King Felipe, looked relaxed and happy as he joined his wife in welcoming students from the European Scholarships programme to the Zarzuela Palace.

The royal couple, who were crowned last month, have recently returned from the third state visit of their short reign, this time to Rabat in Morocco where they met King Mohammed VI and visited the tomb of his father, Mohammed V.

Next on the agenda for the couple is a state visit to France along with a string of engagements in their native Spain.
