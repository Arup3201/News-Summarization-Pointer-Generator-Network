The 
government's broad programs to collect U.S. phone records and Internet traffic 
helped disrupt a 2009 plot to bomb the New York City subways, a senior U.S. 
intelligence 
official said.

But the assertion raises as many questions 
as it answers because court testimony indicated the subway plot investigation began 
with an email.

Over the past days, The Guardian newspaper 
and The Washington Post have revealed classified documents showing how the National Security 
Agency sweeps up phone records and Internet data in its hunt for 
terrorists. Those programs have come under criticism from civil libertarians and 
some in Congress who say they were too broad and collected too much about 
innocent Americans.

In one of those programs, the NSA's collected daily records of millions of 
phone calls made and received by U.S. citizens not suspected of any 
wrongdoing.

On Thursday, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., 
who leads the House 
Intelligence Committee, credited that effort with thwarting a terrorism 
plot. But he did not elaborate.

The senior U.S. intelligence official who asserted Friday that the phone 
records program together with other technical intercepts thwarted the subway 
plot would not provide other details. The official was not authorized to discuss 
the plot publicly and requested anonymity.

Afghan-American Najibullah Zazi pleaded guilty in the 2009 
plot, saying he had been recruited by al-Qaida in Pakistan.

The break in that case came, according to court documents and testimony, when 
Zazi emailed a Yahoo address seeking help with his bomb recipe.

At that time, British intelligence officials 
knew the Yahoo address was associated with an al-Qaida leader in Pakistan. 
That's because, according to British government documents released in 2010, 
officials had discovered it on the computer of a terror suspect there months 
earlier.

Because the NSA and British intelligence work so closely together and so 
little is known about how the NSA monitors email traffic, it's possible that 
both agencies were monitoring the Yahoo address at the time Zazi sent the 
critical email in 2009.

A-OK: There have been no successful terrorist attacks in new York City since 9/11, perhaps in part due to the NSA's 'PRISM@ program

What's unclear, though, is how the phone program aided the investigation, 
which utilized court-authorized wiretaps of Zazi and his friends.

Based on what's known about the phone-records program, the NSA might have had 
an archive of all the phone calls Zazi had made, which might have helped 
authorities look for possible co-conspirators.

Because the phone program remains 
classified, however, it's impossible to say with certainty how the program 
benefited the investigation.
