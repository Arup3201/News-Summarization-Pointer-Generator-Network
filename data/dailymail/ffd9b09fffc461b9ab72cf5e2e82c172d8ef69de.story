Gerard Pique launched his new mobile football game on Friday but the Barcelona defender looks may need a bit more practice after struggling to find the target during a short demonstration.

The app, called Final Kick, is a penalty shootout simulation game and the former Manchester United player attended the Mobile World Congress in Spain to show off his latest off-pitch venture.

The 28-year-old Spain international was invited on to the stage during the event in Barcelona to discuss the game and even showed the audience how it's done. Or not in this case.

Pique, playing the game as Barcelona team-mate Neymar, blazed his first attempt high and wide of the target but managed to see the funny side as he hung his head in shame.

His got closer with his next attempt as the ball cannoned off the crossbar as he failed to find the net for a second time.

After his short demonstration presentation, Pique handed out prizes to participants after they took part in an organised Final Kick tournament.

The game has proved hugely popular among football fans and has already been downloaded a staggering eight million times.
