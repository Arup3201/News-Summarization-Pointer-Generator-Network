A roaring 186mph successor to the legendary E-Type Jaguar has been launched at top speed with a star-studded Hollywood-style flourish.

The wraps came off the new F-Type Coupe at a special celebrity event on the eve of the Los Angeles Motor Show.

Celebrity and VIP guests were treated to a dramatic live-action, full-throttle drive of the car at Raleigh film studios in Playa Vista, California as it accelerated towards them before passing under their noses.

The F-Type - a roaring 186mph successor to the legendary E-Type Jaguar has been launched at top speed with a star-studded Hollywood-style flourish

The wraps came off the new F-Type Coupe in the USA at a special celebrity event on the eve of the Los Angeles Motor Show

The glossy Los Angeles event was attended by a host of celebrities, including supermodel Miranda Kerr, Simon Cowell and Kelly Osbourne.

Jaguar said it is ‘the most dynamically capable, performance-focused production Jaguar ever.’

And it also promises that the 407-litres of boot space is enough to accommodate two sets of golf clubs.

For drivers who like to let in the Californian - or even relatively rare British - sun there is the option of a vast panoramic glass roof panel in place of the standard roof.

The new all-aluminium F-Type coupe is the hard-top sibling of the existing open-topped F-Type Roadster.

Up
 to half the aluminium used in the car is recycled. The car also 
features a ‘ribbon of light’ LED high-mounted stop light which is hidden
 at the top of the tailgate. 

Prices start from £51,235 for the 
entry-level supercharged 3.0 litre V6  F-Type Coupe which develops 340 
horse-power, has a top speed of 161mph and accelerates from rest to 
60mph in  5.1 seconds.

The 3.0 litre S Coupe model costing £60,235 develops 380 horse-power, has a top speed of  171mph and will hit 60mph  from a standing start in 4.8 seconds.

To help keep it glued to the road and reduce ‘lift’,  the F-Type Coupe features a hidden rear aerodynamic spoiler that sits near the tailgate and rises automatically at 70mph, before dropping again when speeds reduce to below 50mph.

The eight-speed ‘Quickshift’ transmission acts in automatic mode and as a manual, using steering wheel-mounted paddles.

The
 range-topping R-Coupe car has a specially tuned active sports exhaust 
system promising ‘a howling crescendo’ of revs, as well as an enhanced 
carbon ceramic brakes to bring the sports coupe safely to a stop. 

The ‘cockpit-style’ interior and flat-bottomed steering wheel is encased in premium leather and contrasting stitching.

All models are fitted with Jaguar’s intelligent 'stop-start’ system which shuts down the engine when the car comes to a stop to save fuel and lower emissions.

Just as well, as the top of the range car is a bit of a gas-guzzler managing only around 25 miles to the gallon.

Among the celebrity guests invited to the event and expected to attend were Simon Cowell, Miranda Kerr, Joe Manganiello, Kelly Osbourne, model David Gandy, Yasmin Mills, Jodie Kidd, singer-songwriter Andra Day and host of CarCast, Adam Carolla.

Also listed to attend were Donna Air, Pete Tong, George Lamb and Rufus Sewell.

Guests enjoyed live music from DJ and violinist duo Mia Moretti and Caitlin Moe.

Jaguar director of design Ian Callum who led the celebrations said: ‘Creating a sports coupé is the purest of design tasks and also the most challenging. I believe we’ve got it right.

'This is possibly the most dynamic reveal of a car ever and underlines its performance credentials.’

Jaguar’s vehicle line director Ian Hoban said: ’The F-Type coupe is the  most dynamically capable  and involving Jaguar we’ve ever built.’

Jaguar Land Rover’s group marketing director Phil Popham said the new F-Type was ‘the definitive sports Coupe.’ He said: ’It provides the driver with a unique sports car experience.

'It combines seductive design with  cutting edge technology and performance which is truly breath-taking.’
