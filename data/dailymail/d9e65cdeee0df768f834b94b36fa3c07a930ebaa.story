An unholy row has erupted in the US after an independent clothing label discovered that 'Jesus' has been registered as a trademark.

When Michael Julius Anton, from Virginia, wanted to patent his company Jesus Surfed he found that an Italian jeans label had already beaten him to it.

Jesus Jeans was registered with the US Patent and Trademark office in 2007 and lawyers have told Mr Anton he cannot trade commercially using his chosen name, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Italian clothing company Jesus Jeans won the exclusive right to use of the name 'Jesus' for clothing brands in the US in 2007

The company does not have a patent on images of Jesus - just his name.

Jesus Jeans has reportedly warned dozens other apparel start ups in the US against using Jesus in their brand since winning the patent.

Others to have been warned include 'Jesus First', 'Sweet Jesus' and 'Jesus Couture'.

Intellectual property lawyers say there is nothing against companies owning century-old names.

'If somebody—small church or even a big church—wants to use 'Jesus' for printing a few T-shirts, we don't care,' said Domenico Sindico  the general counsel for intellectual property at BasicNet, a publicly traded company based in Turin, Italy, that owns Jesus Jeans and the Kappa sportswear brand.

But when companies like Jesus Surfed want to make money from their products, 'that's a concern,' he said.

Lawyers have warned Mr Anton he can only use the name Jesus in 'descriptive, religious, free speech, ornamental sense' and that he should withdraw his trademark application.

The owner of Jesus Jeans, Maurizio Vitale, came up with the name during a visit to New York when he walked by a theatre poster for the musical 'Jesus Christ Superstar'.

BasicNet acquired Jesus Jeans in the 1990s through a bankruptcy but their attempts to trademark 'Jesus' have been turned down in countries including Turkey, China, Switzerland, Australia, Norway and Cuba.

In 2003, Britain's patent office rejected its application as 'morally offensive to the public' but Jesus Jeans registered 'Jesus' through the European Union as a 'Community Trademark' valid across the European Union.

Mr Anton said he is preparing to fight his case.

'Jesus Jeans has absolutely nothing to do with anything biblical,' he said. 'I didn't think it would be that big of a hassle.'
