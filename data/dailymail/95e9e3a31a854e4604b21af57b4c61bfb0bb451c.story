From Botox and fillers to vampire face lifts and creams developed by NASA, the fight against wrinkles seems to grow ever more high-tech.

But one beauty company is convinced it can beat frown lines, not with the help of injections and expensive creams, but with a simple piece of sticky tape.

Realine Beauty has created a £28 hypoallergenic frown line patch - made from tape - that claims to 'naturally and effectively' smooth out forehead frown lines after a few hours application or while you sleep.

Beat the frown lines: Fed up of your lines? Realine Beauty has created a £28 hypoallergenic frown line patch, which promises to smooth them while you sleep

Users are advised to first prepare by cleansing the skin 
area, smooth out the frown line area with one hand and hold the skin 
taut.

Then place the patch over the centre of the forehead frown line 
and leave the patch in place for several hours or overnight.

The brand explain that while 
wearing the patch, the forehead skin is restricted from movement and the
 skin area 're-educated', which, they say, gives a smoothed and relaxed appearance that's retained after the patch has been removed.  

Speaking about the new product, which 
should be used nightly for the best effects, the company says: 'Simply 
designed for home use or on your 
travels, the Realine Beauty patch gives you the personal power to 
improve your appearance and to easily reduce frown lines, eliminating 
dependence on cosmetic procedures, beauty therapists or expensive 
so-called miracle potions.'

Robin Capstick, Founder of Realine, which is sold at Fenwicks Bond Street, said: 'I wanted to 
create a frown patch that was effective, easy to apply, and covered a 
large skin surface area.

'It was important that the adhesive was 
medically approved, and restricted muscle movement, whilst remaining 
kind to the skin.' 

But do they really work? 84 per cent 
of clinical trial participants think so - they said their frown lines 
appeared smoother after using the patch.

These aren't the first of their kind. A similar product called Frownies was created in 1889 by Margaret Kroesen to help her daughter, a concert pianist, beat her frown lines.

Her business then took off and Broadway and Hollywood stars became avid fans of the Frownies.

How do they work? The brand explain that 
whilst wearing the patch, the forehead skin is restricted from movement 
and the skin area 're-educated', which, they say, gives a smoothed and 
relaxed appearance that's retained when it is removed

Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD of 111 Harley St said: 'This isn’t the first time that frown line patches have been available on the market, and with no active "anti ageing" ingredients, this particular product does not differ from its predecessors.

'The science here is simple; when sleeping we tend not to contract our facial muscles through expression so by adding this strip, it reduces the movement even further and keeps the area "smooth".

'This patch is not going to smooth or heal the lines that already exist on the forehead and any visible result will start to reverse once the patch is removed.

'In reality you could achieve the same effect from using tape or a tight hairstyle, however the difference here is the patch has been formulated to be hypoallergenic.'
