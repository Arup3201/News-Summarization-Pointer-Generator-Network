Former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson who was reviled as the 'baddest man on the planet' has launched a children's charity.

The 46-year-old announced yesterday the creation of the Mike Tyson Cares Foundation which vows to 'give kids a fighting chance' by offering safe spaces to help children from
broken homes.

'I am very proud to launch Mike Tyson 
Cares Foundation,' said Tyson, who was jailed in 1992 for raping beauty queen Desiree Washington, which he has always denied.

'I want my legacy to be about charity and
helping children. This is my start.'

His foray into philanthropy is a far cry from the dangerous, excessive passions of his younger years.

In his turbulent life Tyson has been married three times, fathered eight children and became the youngest heavyweight champion the world has ever seen at just 20.

But fame ruined him and his troubled upbringing - his mother was a prostitute and he never knew his pimp father - came back to haunt him.

He
used to keep a white Bengal Tiger named Kenya in his backyard. It cost 
him around £2,000 a month just to care for him, and the story goes that 
one day Kenya got loose and caused quite a commotion in Southington, 
Ohio.

He was also in 
the grip of numerous addictions; to sex, often with strippers and 
prostitutes, even though he was married with children; and to spending 
on an improbable scale.

He spent around £200million, much of it
on gifts to people he barely knew, on cars he never drove, and on bad 
business deals which he barely troubled to understand.

He
was also addicted to alcohol and drugs, having a long dependence on 
marijuana and a fondness for cocaine and Hennessy brandy.

Two years ago,
he was jailed for driving under the influence of cocaine and was found with three bags of the drug in his car.

At
times, he has used prescription drugs like Zoloft for depression, too. 
'I'm on the Zoloft to keep me from killing y'all,' he once announced at a
press conference.

In an interview with Las Vegas Weekly Tyson said: ‘Laying in bed in a hotel room - I try never to be alone, even if it’s a prostitute, a dog.

‘This is really dark. I am in my 
hotel suite, I’ve got seven women there, and I have a morphine drip, and
I had my cocaine, and I had my (Viagra like pill) Cialis, I had my 
marijuana, I had the Hennessy, and I am at my lowest point because I got
paranoid and I thought these women were trying to rob me and set me up.

‘I started beating them. I was in a 
dark place. There was a purpose, though, because I didn’t want to give 
them any more of my soul.

‘So this is my devil, this is where I am, I am locked up alone. There is nobody there telling me that I’m doing too much.'

After years of controversial headlines, 
at the age of 39, Tyson retired in 2005 – but he admits he’s ‘the same 
guy – I just grew up a little bit’.

He has spent his recent years trying to reconnect with his six children by four different mothers.

In
a television interview a few years ago, he said: 'I'm really trying to 
work into recreating my relationship, rebuilding my relationship with my
children.

'I neglected my 
children and the people I was in love with at one time, and I'm bearing 
the brunt of it right now. At this stage in my life, I'm starting to 
feel the pain and the effects from it, and I would like to rekindle that
relationship.'

But his fatherhood has been blighted by tragedy.

In
2009, Tyson was said to be 'inconsolable' after his four-year-old 
daughter Exodus died after her neck was apparently caught in a cord 
dangling from a stationary treadmill at the family home in Phoenix, 
Arizona.

In what police described as a 'horrible accident', the child either slipped, or put her head in the loop of a cord and suffocated.

She was found by her older brother Miguel, seven, who alerted their mother, dancer Sol Xochitl, who had been cleaning in another part of the modest suburban house.

Xochitl, 34, tried to revive her daughter with CPR, but the youngster never regained consciousness.

Tyson, who does not live with the family, rushed from his home in Las Vegas to be by his daughter's bedside.

He spent the night at the hospital  -  where his daughter was on a life-support machine  -  and had been warned by doctors at St Joseph Hospital in Phoenix his daughter had a less than a 50-50 chance of recovering.

He and Xochitl were at the bedside when the youngster lost her fight for life, and did not return to the family home following their daughter's death.

Reflecting on his life Tyson told Las Vegas Weekly in April that he is now the happiest he has ever been, and is just trying to be a good husband to his third wife, and a good father to his children.

Tyson said: ‘In order to wear the crown, you have to have a miserable life, and that is the one that inherits the crown.

‘I don’t know, you have to go from the worst to reach the best. I’m just that extreme type of person. That is who I am, the guy that has no limits.’
