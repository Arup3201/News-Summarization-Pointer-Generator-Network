A top scientist who branded Professor Stephen Hawking 'more machine than man' and a 'brain in a vat' has angered a leading disability charity.

Helene Mialet also claimed the eminent British physicist does not need the use of his body because his field of research is all theoretical.

The phrase 'more machine than man' was once used to describe arch villain Darth Vader in the Star Wars films.

Anger: Helene Mialet provoked a backlash by calling Prof Stephen Hawking a 'brain in a vat'

'Denigrate': Helene Mialet has sparked anger by comparing Professor Hawking to Star Wars villain Darth Vader

Her comments were made in a paper entitled 'On Stephen Hawking, Vader and Being More Machine Than Human'.

But Farah Nazeer, director of external affairs at the Motor Neurone Disease Association said: 'Whilst we 
appreciate that Ms Mialet is an academic exploring issues of how minds 
and machine interrelate, Professor Hawking himself has said: ‘People 
with MND are just normal people with an abnormal condition’.

'Referring to anyone who relies on assistive technology to overcome the 
profound disability and socially isolating effects of motor neurone 
disease as a ‘brain in a vat’ is dehumanising and disrespectful – not 
just to Professor Hawking but to all those doing their utmost to live 
and contribute to our society with this devastating incurable disease, 
which kills five people every day in the UK.'

Mialet's article was published on the opinion pages of science website Wired.com, on Tuesday - Hawking's 71st birthday.

The physicist was diagnosed with degenerative condition amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a form of motor neurone disease, 50 years ago.

She wrote: 'On this day it's worth examining just who and what we are really celebrating: the man, the mind or the machines?

'Hawking has become a kind of a brain in a vat. Since being afflicted with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis almost 50 years ago, his muscles have stopped working, though his mind and senses remain unaffected.

'In some ways Hawking is, to borrow from Obi-Wan referring to Darth Vader, 'more machine now than man'.'

'And indeed, because of his disability, Hawking embodies the mythical figure capable of grasping the ultimate laws of the universe with nothing but the sheer strength of his reasoning - he can't move his body, so everything must be in his mind.

'What else would a theoretical physicist need?'

This month Prof. Hawking became the unlikely star of the Go Compare insurance wesbite's latest television advertising campaign.

The scientist is shown telling a packed lecture theatre that he has discovered how to generate a super massive black hole, before being asked what he will do with the knowledge.

The scene then cuts to Go Compare's opera singer - played by Wynne Evans - haranguing a couple in the street, before a black hole forms behind him and sucks him in.

Professor Hawking has been confined 
to a wheelchair since 1970, but has still managed to publish several key
works of science, including A Brief History of Time.

Despite
being almost completely paralysed, Hawking is able to communicate 
through special speech recognition software that converts tiny movements
in his face muscles into words.

Dr
Mialet has authored several books and papers about Professor Hawking, 
including Hawking Incorporated: Stephen Hawking and the Anthropology of 
the Knowing Subject.

She has taught at Oxford and Harvard, and is currently teaching anthropology at esteemed University of California, Berkeley.

Chris Whitehouse, of the anti-abortion campaign group, Right To Life Charitable Trust, has also blasted Dr Mialet, and said: 'I
disagree passionately and regularly with many of the views that Prof 
Stephen Hawkins expresses, but I would die for his right to express 
them.

'I have nothing but the greatest respect for this incredible man and what he has achieved. To denigrate him for his disability and to belittle his accomplishments is to denigrate human life itself.'

Helene Mialet did not respond to requests for comment today despite messages being left at her office in California.
