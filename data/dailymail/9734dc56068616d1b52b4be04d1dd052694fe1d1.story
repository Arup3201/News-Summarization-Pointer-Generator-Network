Mauricio Pochettino is staying at Southampton following talks with owner Katharina Liebherr.

Pochettino's future was thrown into doubt when executive chairman Nicola Cortese walked away from the club following a bitter dispute with Liebherr.

Saints faced the possibility of manager Pochettino, who has steered them to ninth in the Premier League, and a host of star players following Cortese out the door.

But the Argentine said: 'First of all I 
want to show my complete gratitude to Nicola Cortese. He believed in me 
and my staff and our families are full of gratitude.

‘Eight
 months ago when we were speaking about things I said there would be no 
sense for me to stay but it is completely different now. It is a 
different situation now. Nicola knows about my decision to stay.

‘This
 club is a society and there is no sense to change. I will be here on 
Saturday and beyond. I have spoken with Katharina for five minutes 
today.

'She has told me I 
have her trust. We have spoken briefly to say 'hi' and she said I have her
 full support. We have had no time to talk about other things.

'She told me we have her full support and
 to be stable. Now we have to look to the future.

'It is too hard to say if I will be here in 17 months - but I am 100 per cent committed to the contract and I have a responsibility to the players and to the project.'

Cortese quit after Liebherr, who 
inherited the club when her father Markus died in 2010, demanded a 
bigger say in the running of Southampton.

He resigned just after 7pm on Wednesday, shortly 
after he had persuaded Pochettino to remain in charge 
of the team for the clash with Sunderland on Saturday.

Pochettino,
 who arrived at Southampton on January 18 last year, had vowed to quit 
St Mary’s in support of Cortese’s decision to resign but has relented.

There
 are now widespread fears among staff at Southampton that Liebherr, who 
has no previous experience of running a football club, will decide to 
sell.

She has appointed 
herself non-executive chairman and released a statement to say that the 
process to find a chief executive to run the business had already 
started.

Incredibly, Cortese was locked in talks with West Ham over the £7million sale of Lambert.

Cortese
 and Lambert were scheduled to meet at the club’s Marchwood
 training centre, but that has been cancelled following the Italian's resignation.

End of an era: The club have accepted the resignation of Cortese

Lambert, 
who has a restricted role in the first team, fears his World Cup hopes 
will be in jeopardy if he does not get regular football.

West Ham are unwilling to meet his £70,000-a-week wage demands but are still keen to sign him.

Some
 of Southampton’s players are furious with developments and a number of 
the prominent members of the squad will consider their positions in the 
wake of Cortese’s departure.

There
 has been an odd atmosphere at training following the latest 
developments on the south coast and Pochettino changed a session on 
Wednesday when players were not responding.

He added: 'I was very surprised to see Nicola leave and the players were surprised. It is a distraction from the game (on Saturday against Sunderland). We are professional but we are also human. We have relationships but we just need to think about the game on Saturday.

'I am sure the club will designate someone to listen to potential offers, but I want to make it clear no-one is for sale.'

Luke Shaw, who decided to stay last summer despite interest from Chelsea, is wanted by Manchester City and Liverpool.

Liebherr values him at an astonishing £30m and will sell if a club comes in with a bid.

Shaw
 tweeted: ‘Gutted with that news, but would just like to thank Nicola 
Cortese for everything he has done for me and the club! All the best to 
him!’

James Ward-Prowse
 and Calum Chambers, two of the biggest talents to come through the 
club’s academy, will be targeted by top teams.

Relationship: Skipper Adam Lallana talking with Pochettino on the training ground last week

Liebherr said: ‘With great regret we have accepted the resignation of Mr Cortese.

‘He has done a wonderful job at the club and we very much wanted him to stay. A search has now begun for a successor.

‘In
 the meantime, it is business as usual and we will ensure that the 
manager, the team and all the staff at the club have all the help and 
support they need.’ 

Better than expected: Southampton currently sit in nine points after a terrific first half of the season

Potential: England youngsters such as Luke Shaw (pictured) has made Southampton an example of how to integrate talent from a club's youth system into the first team

That
 has finally happened after Liebherr informed Cortese at the end of last
 year that she intended to have more say in running the club.

Cortese,
 who was retained as executive chairman by the trust when Markus 
Liebherr died, had previously resisted her attempts to take a bigger 
role.

The Italian 
banker, who said goodbye to staff before loading his car with his 
possessions and departing, wanted more investment to fulfil the ambition
 of playing Champions League football.
