Another day, another Google Glass first - this time it's a fight.A man wandering the boardwalk of a beach resort Thursday night believes he caught the first fight ever filmed by Google Glass, and of course it was on the Jersey Shore.The video posted to YouTube is actually the aftermath of the fight more than it is the actual fight, but the amount of access and footage filmed without anyone noticing is both remarkable and startling.

Fun's over: Wildwood, NJ police arrested this bro July 4 after he fought other bros on the beach resort's boardwalk

The video starts with Chris Barrett walking down the boardwalk, taking in all that Wildwood, NJ has to offer on a warm summer evening. It then takes a turn for the worse when there’s a loud commotion.A shirtless male – because Jersey Shore – that appears to be the main perpetrator in the beach brawl pushes his way through the crowd, walking right past Barrett without even knowing he is being filmed.

Smile: You're on camera! Using Google Glass, Chris Barrett filmed several people being arrested without the knowledge or consent of anyone involved

Busted: Remarkably, Barrett was able to wander right up to cops arresting a group of young bros without being stopped or told to go away

‘I was able to get much closer with the glasses than if I had had a camera. I even got up behind a cop and he didn’t say a word to me,’ Barrett told Showbiz 411.

Mail Online was unsuccessful in its attempts to reach local authorities, there is no word on what caused the dust up.The intrepid cameraman sees Google Glass as a leap forward in storytelling, telling Venture Beat that ‘this is a huge step in citizen journalism… having a device that will change the way people capture stories is unbelievable.’

Undercover: Barrett was able to hide in plain sight, filming everything, because the general public isn't yet hip to Google Glass

Unveiling: Vic Gundotra, senior vice president of engineering at Google, presents Google Glass to start the keynote at Google I/O 2012

A documentary filmmaker himself, Barrett is more excited than nervous about how easy it is to film anyone, anywhere at any time without their consent or knowledge. Only two people noticed he was wearing the Google Specs all night, he told Venture Beat.‘If Google Glass takes off, everyone’s going to have their entire life captured … first words, first steps … but also people getting shot, and natural disasters,’ Barrett told Venture Beat.Forget Big Brother, Barrett is watching.
