It happens to us all – you fill up the kettle to make a quick cup of tea, and then have to wait ages for it to boil.

But that frustration could soon be a thing of the past with a device that heats the exact amount of water you need for your cuppa...by boiling it in the mug.

This means that not only does the device save time, it also saves energy. To heat water, a mug is placed on a special induction plate and a magnetic metal rod is immersed in it.

The base creates an electromagnetic field that causes the water around the rod to heat up. And if you have guests over and want to make more than one cup – just place your teapot on the device, called a Miito, and it works in the same energy-efficient way.

According to the Energy Saving Trust, if everyone boiled only the water they need, they would save enough electricity to power the nation’s street lights for two months.

Its makers also claim the Miito is quieter than a normal kettle and produces less limescale. And it works for any other liquids such as milk, and even soup. 

The Miito is the brainchild of young entrepreneurs Nils Chudy and Jasmina Grase, former students of the Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands. 

They set out to redesign the kettle after realising the amount of energy that’s wasted each time it is put on to boil and hailed Miito as an ‘innovative product that eliminates the heating of excess water’.

Efficient: Miito (pictured) could play a small role in energy conservation in the kitchen beacuse unlike a regular kettle, it only heats water that is needed. It can be used to heat any liquid, such as coffee and milk

The Miito gadget uses induction to heat liquid. 

It comprises a metal rod, which is placed into a cup of liquid and an induction plate, which is used like a coaster underneath the cup.

The base contains a coil though which a high frequency alternating current is passed and creates an electromagnetic field.

The heat induced in this base - where 'eddy' currents within the metal and resistance lead to it heating up - is transferred to the liquid in a cup via the metal rod inside it, which gets hot.

Induction heating is faster and more efficient that other methods and heats liquid more consistently.

Mr Chudy, 23, from Berlin, Germany, said: ‘Miito all started with looking at electric kettles and noticing they all look so similar. Later, while researching electric kettles more closely, we noticed that there was a major design flaw.

‘They are extremely wastefully designed – the minimum fill line of the majority of kettles is at approximately 500ml which means that if you want one cup of tea, around 250ml, you waste 50 per cent of the hot water. 

'We set out to redesign the electric kettle from the ground up, to change people’s habits of overfilling electric kettles in order to save energy. Miito is efficient because you only heat the amount of water you need saving time and energy. 

'There’s no limescale to worry about and you can use it with any vessel and any liquid.’

The pair are now looking at ways of mass-producing their kettles, and hope to sell them for around £80 once they hit the shelves.

Quiet: The device is quieter than a normal kettle and produces less limescale, according to its inventors, Nils Chudy and Jasmina Grase. Here, the two components - the metallic rod and induction plate - are pictured
