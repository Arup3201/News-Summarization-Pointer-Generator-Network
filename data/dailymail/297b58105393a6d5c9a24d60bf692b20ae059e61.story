The former drummer of alt-rock band Cake has filed an appeal after he was sentenced to 15 years to life in state prison for molesting a three-year-old girl during a Thanksgiving party five years ago.

Peter Ivan McNeal, 48, has maintained his innocence after he was sentenced at a Los Angeles court on Tuesday. 

Relatives of McNeal said in a statement released on Thursday that they stand with him and called his conviction a 'gross failure of justice'.

Ex-drummer of rock band Cake, Peter Ivan McNeal, 48, appeared at a Los Angeles court on Tuesday where he was ordered to spend 15 years to life in prison. He maintains his innocence and is filing an appeal 

In 2013, jurors found McNeal guilty of oral copulation of a child under 10.

Prosecutors said McNeal molested the girl at a Thanksgiving party in 2009 in Laurel Canyon, where he was a guest.

Cake, which formed in Sacramento, rose to fame with its 1996 hit The Distance. McNeal was in the band from 2001 to 2005. 

He also worked with artists Mike Doughty and Brett Dennen, as well as gaining a recording credit on Norah Jones’ 2009 album The Fall. 

He was sentenced on Tuesday by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge who ordered the 48-year-old to register as a sex offender.
