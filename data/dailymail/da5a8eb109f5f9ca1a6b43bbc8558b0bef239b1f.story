For many women male super model David Gandy is the definition of a perfect man.

As the face of Dolce and Gabbana his chiselled cheeky bones and rock hard abs have graced the cover of countless high fashion magazines, he has stalked hundreds of runways and his latest project is a steamy new video for shoe brand Bionda Castana.

Now one of his co-stars in the advert model Doris Anna has spoken out about her raunchy scenes with the 33 year old hunk, describing him as a ‘pure sex dream’.

Sexy David apparently moves in slow motion in real life and is a 'pure sex dream'

The film ends as Gandy walks away with his true passion - loads of pairs of high heels swung over his shoulder

Reading a little like a ’50 shades’ novel, Doris Anna says of her sexy scene with the Essex-born model: ‘Gandy slowly slipped off my boots. His eyes did not leave mine as he gently placed his hands under my thigh and stroked my leg, working his way up to my foot.’

Despite the seductive feel of the finished product, Doris Anna says that during filming, her mind was flooded by less than glamorous thoughts.

Speaking to Buzzfeed, she admits that as David stroked up her leg she began to panic that she hadn’t shaved her legs that day, and that, having been wearing her Bionda Castana shoes on set all day, that her feet might smell when David removed them.

‘I cringed a bit because at that moment, I thought what every girl would think: Did I shave last night?’

However, it seems David’s natural charisma over shadowed the awkward reality of filming.

‘He really does move in slow motion in real life.

‘He needs no direction — he simply needs to be unleashed and allowed to work his magic,’ the model gushes.

The fashion films sees Gandy smoulder his way from bar to bedroom with numerous beautiful women.

After a steamy night between the sheets, the women wake to find Gandy has made off with their Bionda Castana heels.

Despite the passion portrayed in the film, Dorris Anna admits she was more worried about her unshaven legs and smelly feet

The film was produced by Friends star David Schwimmer and his wife Zoe Buckman, who were both on the set during shooting.

In fact, so bleary eyed was Doris Anna when she arrived for the 5.45am call that she mistook David Schwimmer for David Gandy!

It was only Schwimmer’s ever present form, Doris Anna says, that kept her grounded in the reality that she was on a set, and not actually being seduced by Gandy.

David shows why he is considered by many the best looking man alive. He was pictured doing looking effortlessly cool at a Johnnie Walker party aboard a luxury yacht on the Thames last Friday

In news sure to delight women the world over, David Gandy and actress Samantha Barks are reportedly no longer an item, meaning the 33-year-old is back on the market

She says that in between takes Gandy was charming and kind, engaging in small talk with the models, before dashing off the set early to catch a flight.

David, whose latest romance with Samantha Barks is reported to have recently ended, said the experience of making the film had been enlightening - and said he loves the confidence a great pair of shoes gives a woman.

'Whilst filming, I've learned a lot about the emotional attachment women have with their shoes and about how their shoes can affect how they feel,' he told MailOnline.

'In the film, I couldn't resist finding out more about the woman behind her chosen shoes - the shoes acted as an aphrodisiac.’
