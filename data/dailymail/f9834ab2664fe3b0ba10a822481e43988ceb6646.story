A woman who hated her nose for 'as long as she can remember' was finally spurred on to go under the knife after a total stranger told her she'd be more beautiful if her feature was made smaller.

Speaking about her nose, Kelly Smith, 26, from Essex, told FEMAIL: 'Everyone has body hang-ups growing up. Like all teenage girls, I had plenty. But while I grew out of some of the others and became generally happy with my overall appearance, my nose just seemed to get worse with age. And given that it’s right in the centre of your face, it’s not something you can hide away.'

Kelly felt that her feature was too large for her face and never felt able to wear her hair up because she was convinced that her nose dominated her face.

Kelly Smith, 26, always felt insecure about her nose, left, and was spurred into researching rhinoplasty after a drunk stranger on a train told her that her nose was 'huge'. She is thrilled with the results, right, and believes the confidence boost has helped her land her dream job

More than the physical impact, was the emotional she experienced. She said: 'I was unhappy with my appearance, and this showed. I could spend ages doing my hair and make-up, but I couldn’t change my nose, I couldn’t hide it.

'I’d never catch a glimpse of myself and smile, no matter how long I spent trying to make myself look good, because my nose dominated and overshadowed everything.'

It wasn't until a complete stranger criticised her nose that she decided to do something about it.

Kelly says she is 'so glad' she took the plunge and had the surgery done. She applied for a graduate project manager role in construction prior to the procedure, and secured the position post procedure

Kelly says she has achieved what she set out to do and finally feels her facial features are all in proportion

Kelly said that before she made the change, pictured,  no matter how long she spent trying to make herself look good, she couldn't because she felt that her nose dominated and overshadowed everything else

'I was on a train into London  to meet friends that she when I noticed a drunk man making his way towards me,' she explained.

'I hate situations like that, and tried to shrink into my chair but he was making a beeline for me. The man sat opposite me, and said: "Wow, you are really beautiful. Except for your nose. It's huge!"

'I felt like the whole train was watching me as I tried to laugh it off while dying inside from embarrassment. But, finally, someone had said it. I wasn't being paranoid, it was huge. And I needed to hear it.'

Kelly said that she finally felt as though she could explore cosmetic surgery with a legitimate reason and it wasn't all in her head. 

But while she admits the stranger's comment did spur her into looking into getting rhinoplasty, this wasn’t the reason she had the surgery done. 

For years, Kelly had avoided having photos sideways on and it wasn't until a drunk man on the train pointed it out that she looked into getting something changed 

'To get it done because a drunk stranger commented on it would be silly,' she said. 'Why should I care what he thinks? I had the surgery done for me. For years, my friends had got used to sending photos from nights out and birthdays to me for screening and editing before uploading online. 

'For years, I’d avoided having photos sideways on. For years, I’d stood talking to friends, family, strangers wondering if they’d noticed my horrible nose. Finally I decided it was time to bring that to an end. 

'Why live like that when cosmetic surgery could put an end to it? I’d watched friends spend money on expensive cars and expensive clothes. I’d always been so careful with money, I’d never really blown money on something selfish. 

'I had a good job and money in the bank, and decided it was time I did something that was just for me. The only resolution was cosmetic surgery. And it would be money well spent if it helped improve my confidence and my happiness.' 

Kelly didn't talk to too many people about the procedure but told her boyfriend, and while she says he loves her for who she is, he was supportive as he just wanted her to be happy.

Kelly underwent the procedure at Transform clinic and said she was 'stunned' at the result. 

She said: 'My nose was smaller, straighter and immeasurably better than it was before. I had been scared that I wouldn’t look like "me" any more, but I was wrong. 

'While the surgery had altered the look of my whole face, I still looked like me. With my nose now so small and straight, I’d look in the mirror and see my whole face - not just my crooked nose.'

Kelly says she is 'so glad' she took the plunge and had the surgery done. She applied for a graduate project manager role in construction prior to the procedure, and secured the position post procedure. One of the reasons she had the surgery was to increase her confidence for a potential role as a woman in construction.

She added: 'I have achieved what I set out to do and I finally feel like my facial features are all in proportion. I’ve changed career, and I can say with certainty that the confidence I have gained from having the procedure has had a positive impact on both my working and private life. 

'My boyfriend, friends and family have all noticed not just the physical change, but more importantly the emotional change. I am still me - but with a bigger smile.  I now have the nose I feel I should have been born with.'
