Just as the haute couture shows wrap up in Paris, media moguls and tech titans arrived at the annual Allen 
& Company conference this morning proving that money can't buy style.

Favoring a uniform of polo shirts, lose-fitting jeans, zip-up vests and windbreakers, the world's most influential billionaires, from Facebook’s 
Mark Zuckerberg to Twitter's Dick Costolo and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, entered the 
picturesque Idahoan mountain resort of Sun Valley with little sartorial know-how.

Even the fashion set arrived in understated style. Francois-Henri Pinault, the president of
 Kering, which owns Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga, turned up in black
jeans and a T-shirt.

& Company conference this morning in jeans, zip-up vests and T-shirts

Official Allen & Company merchandise was also a popular fashion accessory among most attendees.

Zynga's Mark Pincus, AOL's Artie Minson, and former New York mayor Micheal Bloomberg all sported Allen & Company-branded baseball caps and vests.

ABC News president Ben Sherwood deviated slightly from this 'Normcore' style (a recently defined fashion trend characterized by unpretentious, average-looking clothing), wearing a chambray linen  shirt. However, pairing it with Obama-style 'dad' pants didn't help to elevate the look.

Official Allen & Company merchandise was also worn proudly among several executives, including Michael F. Neidorff (left), treasurer of The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and his wife, Noemi (right)

Plaid and gingham also made appearances, with 21st Century Fox's Chase Carey, Walmart's Neil Ashe and Netflix's Reed Hastings wearing printed button-up shirts.

The female attendees showed off slightly more of their own personal style, with Stacey Bendet Eisner, the CEO of fashion
 brand Alice + Olivia, leading the pack.

She wore a printed maxi 
skirt, several statement necklaces and a pair of oversize sunglasses. Philanthropist Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen chose a chic sunhat and model Sarah Murdoch, wife of Lachlan Murdoch, wore a crisp white shirt, pale jeans and an over-the-shoulder Celine bag.

Meanwhile Craig Barrett, Intel's former chairman of the board, and his wife Barbara, looked to the wild west for inspiration, wearing cowboy inspired outfits that featured a fair amount of fringing.

The annual conference at Sun Valley, known as 'billionaires summer camp', is organized by influential investment bank Allen & Company.

Moguls from all over the world spend a week socializing and deal-making behind closed doors, and this year there are rumors Rupert Murdoch may initiate a Time Warner buyout.
