An elite Tory dining club that enjoys direct access to David Cameron in return for cash has given more than £43million to the party, it can be revealed.

The secretive Leader’s Group of major donors is open only to those prepared to give the Conservatives at least £50,000 a year.

In return, they are promised regular dinners, lunches and drinks reception with the Prime Minister and other senior Tory figures.

No list of members has ever been published and details of the topics discussed are never revealed.

But data released to the Daily Mail in the wake of the 2012 ‘Dinners for donors’ row reveals that 72 members of the group have taken the opportunity to dine privately with Mr Cameron and other senior ministers in the past 18 months.

Between them, they have given the party £43.4million since 2001. Some have attended at least six Leader’s Group events since 2012.

The decision to publish limited data follows controversy in 2012 when it emerged that Mr Cameron had hosted secret dinners for major donors at his Downing Street flat and at Chequers.

Ministers always denied that donors had used their access to influence policy but quarterly lists of donors who have attended events with the Prime Minister are now published.

The disclosures will, however, raise concerns about the influence of behind-the-scenes lobbying and the ability of the rich to buy access to Mr Cameron.

Other ministers who have attended the events include Chancellor George Osborne, Foreign Secretary William Hague, Home Secretary Theresa May, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.

There is no evidence that the hedge fund bosses, property magnates, oil executives and others involved have ever asked for or received policy changes.

But critics warn that the secrecy surrounding the events will inevitably raise suspicions.

Tory sources insist that, in publishing the names of those attending functions with the Prime Minister, they are being more open than Labour.

Ed Miliband has failed to keep his pledge to publish regular lists of meetings with union barons and other major donors.

A Tory source said it was ‘malicious’ to suggest that members of the Leader’s Group enjoy undue influence. But Alexandra Runswick, director of campaign group Unlock Democracy, said the revelations would fuel public concern.

‘Whenever there is secrecy there is suspicion,’ she said. ‘It is very difficult for a member of the public to see a businessman spending £50,000 to meet David Cameron at a private dinner and not feel there is something going on that is not in their interests.’

The Leader’s Group was set up in 2003 and has grown to become a key part of Tory fundraising.

Membership is dominated by financiers. Those attending dinners in the past 18 months include a dozen hedge fund bosses and five bankers, including three former executives from failed banks Lehman Brothers and Barings.

The group also includes the wives of two controversial Middle Eastern businessmen not eligible to donate in their own right.

Tamasin Cave, of the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency, said the Leader’s Group was the ‘tip of the iceberg’ in the hidden world of secret influence: ‘It’s straight up cash for access of the type that we’ve got very used to in this country. A seat at these dinner parties provides these businessmen with a private space in which to discuss their concerns, whether its taxes, regulation or policy. They’re not just social occasions.

‘At the same time, the Government... is pretending to expose such lobbying with a sham register of lobbyists. People are fed up with a system that provides an open door to government for the wealthy and well connected, while everyone else is excluded.’

Labour MP Michael Dugher said: ‘It’s no wonder the Prime Minister stands up for the wrong people when he is selling access to a privileged few.’

But Labour was silent on why Mr Miliband has failed to publish details of his own meetings with major donors, including the trade union bosses who have bankrolled his leadership to the tune of more than £24million since 2010.

A Conservative Party spokesman insisted that the operation of the Leader’s Group was above board and all donations declared to the Electoral Commission.

The revelations follow controversy this week over the Government’s refusal to publish a full list of the people entertained by Mr Cameron at Chequers.

Tory sources said data showed that since 2012 no dinners had been held for donors at the PM’s official residences, including Chequers.

The Conservatives declined to say where Leader’s Group dinners are now held or what is discussed.

Members of the Leader’s Group include Russian businessman Alexander Temerko, right, who has attended two events and donated more than £200,000 to the Tories since 2012.

Mr Temerko runs a wind farm firm, Offshore Group Newcastle.

Last summer he paid £90,000 for a 
bust of Mr Cameron at a Tory fundraising event.

The Leader’s Group also includes the wives of two controversial Middle Eastern businessmen.

May
 Makhzoumi, pictured below with her husband, who has given more than £1million since 2010, is married to Lebanese businessman Fouad Makhzoumi, who was caught up in a scandal involving Conservative Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken.

Rosemary Said, who has given the party 
almost £580,000, is married to Syrian-born businessman Wafic Said who 
made a fortune as a fixer to the Saudi Royal Family, including the 
controversial Al Yamamah arms deal with the UK.

Scottish property tycoon Malcolm Scott, who has given almost £850,000, attended a dinner with Mr Cameron in the spring of 2012 while his business empire was collapsing. It has since gone under, leaving debts of millions.

Venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft, right, attracted controversy in 2012 after writing a report for Mr Cameron on cutting red tape, which included a proposal to allow employers to fire staff at will.

Mr Beecroft has given more than £750,000 but his key recommendation was rejected by the Government because of opposition from the Liberal Democrats.

Others the list include the celebrity hairdresser John Frieda, who has given the party more than £260,000, musician Michael Batt, who has donated more than £160,000, and Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross, who has donated more than £220,000.

The Leader’s Group also contains some of Britain’s wealthiest individuals.

Richest is the industrialist Sir Anthony Bamford, whose family is worth an estimated £3.1 billion and who has given more than £2.5million.

Others include the hedge fund boss Michael Hintze and pharmaceuticals magnate Lord Ballyedmond.

An earlier version of this article said Alexander Temerko was wanted for fraud in Russia and that donations he made to the Conservative Party were cleared by the Electoral Commission. We are happy to clarify that a British court found that the charges were politically motivated and that the donations did not require clearance because Mr Temerko is a British citizen.
