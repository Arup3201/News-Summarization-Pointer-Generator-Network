A reporter has admitted phone hacking while at the Sunday Mirror.

Dan Evans said he was involved in illegal hacking at the newspaper before he was recruited to join its rival the News of the World.

He has pleaded guilty to two charges of phone hacking at the two papers – the first journalist to admit hacking outside of the News of the World.

Job offer: Dan Evans, left, said he secured a £53,000-a-year role with the News of the World after a meeting with Andy Coulson, right, who he says knew he had hacked phones, the Old Bailey heard yesterday

Evans, 38, told the Old Bailey 
yesterday he was ‘tasked’ with targeting the phones of celebrities after
 he was given a staff job on the Sunday Mirror in 2003.

The illegal 
hacking won him a string of exclusives and he was then approached to 
join the News of the World and interviewed by its then editor Andy 
Coulson.

Evans said he had discussed the illegal practice with 
Coulson at the interview in 2004. He said: ‘I moved on to voicemail 
interception, told him how I had a lot of commercially sensitive data 
inside my head, my lists... that I could bring him big exclusive stories
 cheaply.

‘It was a ker-ching moment really: Big exclusive stories cheaply equals job.’

Evans
 said Coulson, who later became David Cameron’s communications chief, 
had seemed ‘really pleased’ and he had got the job.

Mr Evans said: 'I told him about my 
background, the sort of stories I had been doing. Almost the sort of 
stuff I had been through before.

'I
 got onto voicemails and interception and I told him I had a lot of 
commercially sensitive data in my head and how things worked at the 
Sunday Mirror and I could bring him big exclusive stories cheaply which 
was the kerching moment. Bring exclusive stories cheaply equals job.'

Criminality: Evans, pictured leaving court, said he had intercepted voicemails at the Sunday Mirror but did not want to become the News of the World's 'pet phone hacker'

Over breakfast he said he told
 Coulson: 'You could go out on an investigation, spend a long period of 
time getting under the skin of a greasy public interest issue.

'The
 other is you dial up somebody's phone and call the list, work out who 
they are having a relationship with, hack their phones, voicemails and 
pin down exclusive photos'.

The term ‘phone 
hacking’ was not used then, he said, but added: ‘Andy knew what the 
context of it was.’

Evans had turned down chances to leave
 the Sunday Mirror because he did not want to become a 'pet phone 
hacker', for James Weatherup, who was already working at the NotW, he 
said.

Evans discussed 
the practice with staff from the newspaper when they had their first 
meeting to discuss a possible job, the court heard.

He
 said: 'Voicemail interception became part of the conversation. It was 
not referred to as phone hacking - that phrase did not exist then.'

At a second meeting at the same bar with Weatherup, they were joined by another NOTW staff member, who cannot be named.

Evans said: 'He sat down and said "I know you can screw phones, what else can you do?' '

To which Evans, 38, replied: 'Quite a lot, actually. I told him I was an investigative reporter.'

His third meeting was with Andy Coulson, he said.

Mr Evans was offered the job the same day and he started at NOTW on January 5 2005 on a salary of £53,000 and was given a list of around 100 targets including Simon Cowell, 
David Beckham, Michael Barrymore and Michael Jackson, he told the jury.

On his first day, Mr Evans said he was taken into a meeting room and handed a contacts list by a NOTW journalist who cannot be named.

He started at the News of the World in January 
2005  
He said he probably hacked phones more than 1,000 times.

Job: Evans said he was 'crestfallen' when on his first day at the NotW he was handed a contacts list of celebrities to try to target, including Simon Cowell and Chris Evans, the court heard

He was given
 a cash advance to buy pay-as-you-go phones that were nicknamed 
‘burners’ because they were used for ‘illicit activities’ and would be 
destroyed or ‘burned’.

Evans said he was discovered when he used his 
work phone, not a ‘burner’, to target interior designer Kelly Hoppen. 
She won a court order forcing Vodafone to reveal the identity of her 
would-be hacker.

Among
 the names were Heather McCartney, Simon Cowell, Esther Rantzen, Chris Evans, Ed 
Balls, Ronnie Biggs, Elle Macpherson, Katie Price, Jodie Marsh, Michael Parkinson, John Leslie, Geri Halliwell and Michael 
Jackson.

Convicted hacker Dan Evans told the court he was caught after a 'moronic' mistake.

The 38-year-old had tried to access the voicemails of designer Kelly Hoppen (right) - but accidentally used his own phone which was later traced.

He said: 'I made a fundamental blunder. In a moment of panic I tried to hack her phone and failed miserably and she re-set the security system.

'She received an alert that someone had tried to enter the wrong PIN number in the system.'

Hoppen then got a legal order to find out which phone number had called her, and this was Evans' work phone.

He told the court that in the past he would have used a phone that could be discarded, or 'a burner', but due to budget constraints and following the conviction of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and former NoTW royal editor Clive Goodman for phone hacking in 2007 no longer had access to such handsets.

When asked why he had used his own handset, Evans told the court: 'I was a moron.'

Mr Evans said he was rather 'crestfallen' at being given the task.

Asked
 how many of the numbers he hacked, Mr Evans said there were 80-100 
names on the list and his department were spending a 'couple of grand a 
week' on data, including phone numbers.

Mr Evans told the court that he 
would hack phones 'probably most days' while at the News of the World, 
and that he had accessed voicemails more than 1,000 times.

'Not as many as at the Sunday Mirror but quite a lot,' he said.

He claimed
 that the newspaper used a company that could provide personal 
information including phone humbers, credit activity, telephone bills, 
medical and tax records within three hours.

Most of the NoTW features department's budget went on paying for stories like kiss and tells, Mr Evans told the jury.

He said: 'Dark arts were applied to generate leads and tips which would often be locked down with the aid of a cheque book.'

The court heard that Evans has already admitted conspiracy to hack phones at the Sunday Mirror between February 2003 and January 2005, and the same offence at the News of the World between April 2004 and June 2010.

He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office between January 2008 and June 2010, and perverting the course of justice by giving a false statement in High Court proceedings.

Evans told the jury that he was involved in hacking at the Sunday Mirror for about a year and a half from 2003 when he was given a staff job, but it had been going on before that.

Asked by prosecutor Andrew Edis QC what his job at the Sunday Mirror was, Evans said: 'I was a news reporter. Principally I was tasked with covering news events, investigations, undercover work, latterly with hacking people's voicemail.'

Accusations: Evans told the court that he hacked phones 'most days' while at the News of the World but did it more at the Sunday Mirror

Former NotW editors Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks are on trial accused of conspiring with others to hack phones and misconduct in a public office. 

Brooks is also charged with perverting the course of justice.

The pair deny the charges against them along with five other defendants in the case.

The trial continues.
