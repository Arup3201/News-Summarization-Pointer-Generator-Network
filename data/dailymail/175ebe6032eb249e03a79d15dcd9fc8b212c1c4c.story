For anyone who was relying on being able to escape from a robot simply by climbing stairs, it could be a bone chilling sight.

Researchers in America have revealed astonishing footage of a human-like robot able to walk, jump and run over almost any obstacle in its path.

Eventually it is hoped the technology could be used to create a new breed of robotic soldiers able to operate in any terrain, and robots capable of being sent into dangerous disaster zones deemed impossible for humans to enter.

The robot is able to leap tall steps in a single bound - all without losing its balance.

The amazing robot, called proto-pet, is expected to be one of those competing in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) which was announced today.

The US military funded challenge is for robots who can operate entirely by themselves.

'The Department of Defense’s strategic plan calls for the Joint Force
 to conduct humanitarian, disaster relief and related operations,' DARPA
 said in a statement.

'The plan identifies requirements to extend aid to victims of natural or man-made disasters and conduct evacuation operations. 

'Some disasters, however, due to grave risks to the health and 
wellbeing of rescue and aid workers, prove too great in scale or scope 
for timely and effective human response.

The robots will compete next year in a series of events designed to show off how they could help out in a disaster zone

'The DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) will attempt to address this 
capability gap by promoting innovation in robotic technology for 
disaster-response operations. 

'The primary technical goal of the DRC is to develop ground robots 
capable of executing complex tasks in dangerous, degraded, 
human-engineered environments.'

Robots entered into the contest will also be expected to use tools normally operated by humans.

'Competitors in the DRC are expected to focus on robots that can use 
standard tools and equipment commonly available in human environments, 
ranging from hand tools to vehicles, with an emphasis on adaptability to
 tools with diverse specifications.'

The contest will culminate next year, when the robots will participate in two live events June 2013 and December 2013.
