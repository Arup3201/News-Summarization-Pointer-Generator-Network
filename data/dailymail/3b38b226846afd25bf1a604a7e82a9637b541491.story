Former Chelsea and France midfielder Marcel Desailly believes the FA Cup will prove the most difficult for Jose Mourinho if he is to claim an unprecedented four trophies this season.

Chelsea remain joint-top of the Barclays Premier League, are in the Capital One Cup semi-finals and have made the last 16 of the Champions League.

Manchester United won the treble in 1999 but, if Chelsea are to go one better, then they must get beyond Watford at Stamford Bridge on Sunday in the third round of the FA Cup.

Desailly feels it is this competition that will pose the greatest threat to Jose Mourinho's four-trophy aim

Desailly, winner of the FA Cup with Chelsea in 2000, feels it is this competition that will pose the greatest threat to the Mourinho machine.

'If any team can win all the trophies, it is Chelsea,' the 46-year-old told the Sunday Mirror. 'But it will be very, very hard. No one will be happier than me if they achieve it, but I honestly think it cannot be done. 

'Why? Because it [the FA Cup] means so much to the other clubs. You depend so much on how fortunate you are with the draw. Yes, you can have it easy. But it can also be very, very hard.

'Imagine that you come back from a Champions League game in midweek and have to face one of the big clubs away from home.

'And it can be just as hard if you face one of the smaller clubs if it is not at your ground. They will give everything. They show a lot of fight and spirit because it means so much to them.

'You have to hope that the players, who are not usually regulars, come in and do the job. That is not easy.'

Desailly spent six years with Chelsea between 1998 and 2004, making 158 Premier League appearances, and feels the great advantage his former club have is that they know the Mourinho way.

'Their great advantage is that all the players know the system that Mourinho wants to play,' he added. 

'Everybody knows their role in the team. They are like a well-oiled machine. I love the way they play. But the schedule is very tough. And the FA Cup can be a very hard trophy to win. I know because I won it.'
