A restaurateur couple made infamous by an episode of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares have been caught on camera in a furious row with an irate and 'drunken' customer.

Video from TMZ shows furious Samy Bouzaglo, Amy's Baking Company in Scottsdale, Phoenix, as he appears to chase down a customer with what has been claimed to be a knife, but which Samy now insists is a pen.

Holding him back is similarly hot-headed wife Amy Bouzaglo, who a witness said had just kicked out the patron her husband was trying to chase down.

And today, Amy told MailOnline the incident kicked off after a drunken customer came in and was abusive to her and husband Samy, saying: 'The guy told us 'You're a f***ing piece of s**t.'

Shocking: Video from TMZ shows the couple behind Amy's Baking Company in Phoenix as irate husband Samy Bouzaglo appears to chase down a customer while brandishing an object that he claims is a 'big pen'

Furious: Amy tries to hold back Samy during the altercation. Amy claims the man in the confrontation with Samy told him: 'You're a f***ing piece of s***'

Back off: Amy claimed the man was 'looking for trouble' and was clearly drunk when he entered the bakery

Traumatized: Amy, who filmed the incident herself, said the man was giving them abuse about the show

Amy - who says she is 'traumatized' by the incident - continued: 'We are trying to rebuild our business, we've been bullied for the past 18 months and just when we're trying to clear our name this happens.'

The blonde continued: 'Everything has been positive and we're moving on, then out of the blue, at 4.30pm on Saturday, this man came in with two people, screaming, and he was so drunk you could smell the alcohol across the room.

'I was busy, I just made a bunch of eclairs and was instagramming and this guy yells 'what is this - seat yourself?!'

'I said to Samy 'these guys came for trouble', they started to walk over towards our back booth and sat themselves down.

'Samy went over and said 'Sir, I'm very sorry, I cannot have you here. You appear to be drunk, I politely ask you to leave'. The guy said 'fine you can do whatever you want....I just came to take a p*ss all over your walls anyway'.'

Amy claims that similar threats have been sent to the couple online, adding: 'This guy stops and he says 'You're a f***ing piece of s**t, I saw the show, I saw the show'.

'Samy said 'f**k you', and the guy started to walk away. Samy said 'What the f**k? You said you were going to come and p*ss all over my walls?'

'The guy stopped, he turns around and then he started running towards me, Samy was on the patio, so I ran around the guy to block him and I was screaming 'stop him', I filmed him the whole time and he was charging towards me'

'Samy grabbed me and pulled me inside, he had a silver pen in his hand, it was not a knife, it was a big pen.

'Once we got inside, oh my God, we were traumatized. '

Infamous: Amy and Samy Bouzaglo look displeased with Gordon Ramsay before he walked out of their restaurant on the most explosive episode of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares in May 2013

Death threats: Samy and Amy told MailOnline last year how they were bombarded by death threats following their appearance on the Fox show, Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares

The Bouzaglos now plan to contact police, but Amy said: 'I’m traumatized by what’s happened, I don’t know what is going out – we’re still here fighting! We're bleeding money, we're hoping and dreaming we can turn things around for the better.'

In the video published on TMZ, Samy can be seen lunging at the patron with an object.

'It's not worth it,' says a voice from behind the camera, 'You're going to go to jail for the rest of your life.'

Amy Bouzaglo holds her husband back as he moans to her, 'Let me.'

The video soon cuts forward in time to when Amy becomes the enraged one. 'You m***** f****** piece of s*** coward' she yells down the street to someone out of camera view.

For those who saw the couple on their TV debut last year, this anger episode comes as no big surprise.

Amy's Baking Company became the subject of ridicule when it featured on Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.

Footage before Ramsay arrived showed diners waiting more than hour for their meals, with Mrs Bouzaglo cooking each meal one at a time.

One told the Phoenix New Times: 'You could hear Amy yelling in the kitchen and Samy was running all over the dining room.

New menu: The Bouzaglos say they have spent the past 18 months trying to rebuild their business in Phoenix, Arizona and this Wednesday will debut a new menu with lighter fare

Proud: Amy says she has been posting pictures of her pastries on Instagram - and in November will release her own cookbook, Baking With Amy, saying: 'It's all fun, the message is 'make cake, not war'

'Other tables were complaining and people were leaving because they were waiting so long for their food. My partner and I had reservations for 6:45. By 9:30, we still hadn't received our pizza.'

And when one customer confronted Ms Bouzaglo about the fact he still had not been served he as told to 'go f*** yourself.'

Even the fiery Mr Ramsay was left open-mouthed by the chaotic goings-on at the bistro - which included a young waitress being fired for asking a question, and Mrs Bouzaglo threatening to call the police on a customer who tried to leave after waiting a long time for his pizza.

When Mr Ramsay tried to give the husband and wife team some pointers as to where they were going wrong, he was met with open aggression from Mr Bouzaglo and complete denial about the quality of the food from Mrs Bouzaglo.

And after Mr Ramsay reveals to diners that the owners have been keeping the tips of their waiting staff, the chef came close to trading blows with Mr Bouzaglo.

It later came to light that the couple had fired around 50 employees in just a year.

Amy told MailOnline: 'We're rebuilding everything, this Wednesday we have a new relaunch with our menu. We're lightening the food up, we have really beautiful, healthy salads.

'And I wrote a cookbook called 'Baking With Amy' out in November, it's all fun, the message is 'make cake, not war'.
