The world’s 
fastest man claimed chicken McNuggets were the key to his success when 
he won gold for the 100 metres at Beijing in 2008.

So Usain Bolt may be pleased to hear that it will take him under 20 seconds to sprint from the running track in the Olympic Stadium to the world's biggest McDonald's restaurant during the London 2012 Games.

The
gigantic McDonald’s, one of four in the Olympic park, has been built just 200 metres from the 
Olympic stadium and will open next 
month for six weeks during the Olympics and Paralympics.

The chain is a controversial sponsor of the Games and this branch in Stratford, east London, is expected to shift more than 50,000 Big Mac burgers and 180,000 portions of fries during the event.

The temporary branch will also have seating for 1,500 customers but will give London a boost by employing 2,000 staff.

Built from recyclable materials, the
3,000 square-metre restaurant will 
stretch over two floors - the equivalent to half the length of an 
American football field. Around three million people are expected to visit between July 27 and September 9 while they watch the Games. 

A whopping 12,000 people applied to 
work at the restaurant and had to undergo X-Factor style auditions, in which
they were judged on politeness and
how well they flipped burgers, served ice cream and cooked the French 
fries.

McDonald’s has been connected with the Olympics since 1968 when the company airlifted 
hamburgers to U.S. athletes competing in Grenoble, France.

It first became an official sponsor at the 1976 Games in 
Montreal and in 1984 footed the bill for the Olympic swimming
stadium in Los Angeles.

The sponsor choices for the Games - McDonald's joins Coca-Cola, Heineken and Cadbury - has been slammed by medics who say it sends the wrong message in a country with ballooning obesity.

'It's very sad that an event that celebrates the very best of athletic achievements should be sponsored by companies contributing to the obesity problem and unhealthy habits,' said Terence Stephenson, a spokesman for the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges.

About one-quarter of Britons are obese and experts estimate that could jump to half by 2030. Obesity and related health ailments cost the UK health system about £4billion every year.
