A teenage boy has been charged with the December mugging of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's teenage son.

The young suspect, whose age was not immediately released by police, was arrested on Saturday and charged as a juvenile with robbery and aggravated battery in the public way.

The attack had occurred on December 19 near the Emanuel family's home when 17-year-old Zach had been speaking on his cell phone around 10pm.

According to a police report, two males approached him from behind.

One of the robbers put the teen in a chokehold and the second punched him, knocking him to the ground. The report says they took his cell phone and patted him down.

'The offenders then asked the victim, 'What else you got?' (and) forced the victim to enter his security code to unlock the phone,' the police report said.

The robbers then ran away.

At the time, a spokeswoman for the mayor said Zach was treated for cuts and bruises on his face by a personal physician at his home.

There is no information on when the boy – who has confessed to the crime – will appear in court.

Emanuel spokesman Adam Collins issued a statement following the arrest.

'The Mayor and Amy (Rule, Emanuel's wife) are grateful to the dedicated men and women of the Chicago Police Department for their hard work, and they would like to thank everyone who shared kind thoughts and wishes for their son's well-being,' Collins said in the statement.

'As parents, they continue to ask that the media respect their family's privacy.'

Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff, is running for re-election.
