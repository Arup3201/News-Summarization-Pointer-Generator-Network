At least six children have been wounded after a fellow student tossed a hand grenade into their school playground in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi today.

Children were playing outside when the grenade was detonated and thrown into the school grounds shortly before 11am this morning.

Five of the victims, aged 13 to 17, were seriously wounded in the attack and were rushed to Benghazi's Al-Jala hospital for treatment.

Witnesses said the blast also damaged part of the school building. It is not yet known who is responsible for the attack but Libyan officials claim it was a student at the school.

But a Benghazi resident told the BBC that a family member saw a man use his mouth to prepare the grenade for detonation before throwing it into the school.

They claim he then fled the scene in a black car as people ran screaming from the blast.

Blasts and assassinations are not 
uncommon in Benghazi, where security forces are battling Islamist 
militants tied to the Ansar al-Sharia group, which Washington has listed
 as a foreign terrorist organisation.

The latest attack comes just a few days after the son of Libya's special forces chief was kidnapped by gunmen in Benghazi.

Two and a half years after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, Libya's army is struggling to control heavily armed former rebels, militias and militants who once fought against Gaddafi's forces.

Militia brigades often fight turf wars for control of areas and businesses, and they have refused to disarm.

The children were taken to Benghazi's Al-Jala hospital where they are being treated for their injuries
