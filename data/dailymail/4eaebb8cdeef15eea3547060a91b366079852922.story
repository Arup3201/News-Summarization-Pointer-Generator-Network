Balotelli, who has been linked with a switch back to the Premier League this summer, also does a little jig before hiding his face behind the book.

The 23-year-old Arsenal target posted the video accompanied with the words 'knowledge is power, reading books is cool, stay in school kids'.

Balotelli has been frequently posting snaps of himself and his girlfriend Fanny Neguesha.

The Italian, who announced he had proposed to Fanny, has been chilling out since Italy were eliminated from the World Cup during the group stages.
