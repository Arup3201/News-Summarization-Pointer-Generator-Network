They both found fame on a reality TV show but it seems that Sam Faiers is giving Cheryl Fernandez-Versini a run for her money in the success stakes.

The TOWIE star is 'ecstatic' that her fragrance, La Bella, beat the X Factor judge's scent to be crowned fragrance of the year - and now Sam has even bigger plans for her brand. 

Speaking to MailOnline about her recent coup, she said: 'I am literally ecstatic, I can’t believe that I launched my fragrance and I’ve won an award all in a year. I'm so happy that I've been involved in every aspect working on La Bella from the initial idea to now.'

And it wasn't just Cheryl's Storm Flower fragrance she beat, she also pipped One Direction to the top spot. 

'One Direction and Cheryl are huge names so I had to pinch myself when they announced the winner - I was with my mum and my auntie and we screamed so loudly,' added Sam. 

Clearly not one to rest on her laurels, Sam has plans to develop her brand further. 'The La Bella gift set is out now so it’s perfect for a Christmas present, it includes a shimmering body lotion which is La Bella scented so it’s perfect to make your fragrance last longer,' she said.

'Next year I’ve got some really exciting launches and products too.'
