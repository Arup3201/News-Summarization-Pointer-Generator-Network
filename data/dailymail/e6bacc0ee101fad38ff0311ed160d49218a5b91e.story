Christian Eriksen has revealed Mauricio Pochettino’s brutal pre-season training regime is responsible for the second wind that has lifted Tottenham Hotspur up the table.

Late goals are becoming a blessing for a side that has so far been distinctly underwhelming, with Eriksen rescuing his side with a last-minute strike in the 2-1 win at Swansea City on Sunday.

It was an almost identical scenario when he sank Hull City in late November, with Tottenham so far benefiting from four goals in the last five minutes of Premier League fixtures this season. Only Arsenal have snatched more.

The impact on Tottenham’s league position has been enormous, with nine points coming directly from their late shows, not to mention Wednesday's Capital One Cup quarter-final against Newcastle United, which follows a two-goal salvo at the end of their third-round win over Nottingham Forest.

Pochettino was quick to praise his side’s character after the Liberty Stadium win, but Eriksen is convinced the fast finishes are derived from a hard summer following the Argentine's arrival.

‘Pre-season was the toughest I’ve experienced,’ he said. ‘The gaffer worked the players really hard.

‘But I think it is paying off now. Of course we are tired after games, that is normal, but as you see with us in the last few weeks we are able to go 100 per cent again and again at the end of the games. Before we wouldn't have been fit enough to go the whole game.

‘Obviously there will be periods when the other team have the ball and you have to play differently. But in the end we have the confidence and power to keep going for 90 minutes.

‘We always seem to get that feeling late in a game when we can really go for it. We seemed to get more confident late in the game.’

Eriksen added: ‘It doesn’t matter how or when you win but I think everybody would rather win a bit earlier - although it wouldn’t be as exciting.

‘But the win at Swansea proves we have a lot of belief in the squad. Once again we showed our character and got over the line.’

Tottenham were again far from impressive in beating Swansea, with Eriksen concerned that they are not performing consistently in a campaign that has already seen them beaten six times in the league.

‘We are where we are,’ he said. ‘It’s so close in the league at the moment. You get a win and you are right up there where you want to be. And if you lose you are down where you don’t want to be. At the moment we are in between.

‘We certainly need to be more consistent but we are going the right way.’
