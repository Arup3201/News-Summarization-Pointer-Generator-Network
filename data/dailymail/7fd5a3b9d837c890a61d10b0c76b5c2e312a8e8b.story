A ‘rent-a-killer’ website was still operating in Russia today after officials claimed it had been banned.

The sinister site offers 'assassination services' and breaking the bones of targets in a catalogue of services said to be suitable for wives seeking revenge on cheating husbands.

One option is throwing targets in a car boot and driving them to a remote location where they are threatened and attacked.

Shocking: Zakazat-killera.com offers services such as 'physical elimination' on their site which was live tonight

The Russian Interior Ministry told a senior lawmaker that the site had been blocked, but tonight it was still accessible both in Russia and abroad.

'The website contained commercial offers of illegal services - physical elimination or transportation to a forest for a talk,' complained Ruslan Gattarov, a Russian senator, who called for its blacklisting.

'There is a detailed description of every service, such as the restraint of a target with ropes, handcuffs or sticky tape, the transportation of the target to a remote place and his beating with clubs, legs or fists.'

The attacks are carried out by mafia gangsters, or ex-soldiers or sportsmen, it is claimed.

It offers 'mercenaries for dealing with uncooperative partners, cheating husbands, rogues, thieves and the rest'.

Clients are 'guaranteed' no problems with the police as the shadowy forces behind the site 'have links with the law enforcement agencies'.

They are also provided with a photograph from the scene of the attack, it is claimed.

The cost of assassinations are negotiated depending on their complexity, explains the site.

For a 'slight shaking' of a victim, the site lists a tariff of £611, a more serious attack with bruises, teeth broken but bones intact costs £917, and causing serious injury, including broken limbs, is £1835.

International: The website lists locations of Russian offices and says they can carry out their services in other parts of the world including the USA, Europe, Asia, South America, Iraq and Afghanistan

It also offers 'protection services' for businesses and brothels.

The website - called zakazat-killera.com - is anonymously registered through a Chinese company and located in the former Soviet republic of Moldova, claimed Russian Deputy Interior Minister Mikhail Vanichkin.

Russian police regularly detain men and women who have ordered contract killings on relatives or business partners.
