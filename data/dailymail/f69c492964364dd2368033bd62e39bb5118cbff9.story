Known as much for her resolutely down to earth attitude as her equestrian talents, Zara Phillips has once again shown how very like the rest of us she is.

The Queen's daughter was spotted enjoying a pizza at Aldon Horse Trials, in Somerset, yesterday.

Sitting outside with friends dressed in navy fleece, cap and camel jodhpurs, the royal was indistinguishable from the other spectators and riders at the event.

Zara tucked into her meal with gusto, clearly having worked up quite an appetite during the mornings riding 

The Queen's granddaughter removed her riding boots to eat- revealing some rather funky stripy socks  

Zara ate her meal with a male friend outside sitting round a metal table on a metal chair 

Having left daughter Mia at home for the day, the 33-year-old, who had two horses entered at the event 'First Watch' and 'Rum Expectations'- took time out after completing the dressage in the morning for a spot of lunch. 

She was seen queuing for a wood fired pizza and then sat at a nearby table with her dogs 'Corey' and 'Spey' and a male friend to eat it, washing the gourmet meal down with a carton of Ribena blackcurrant juice drink. 

Afterwards they walked the cross country course, checking out a few of her competitors before heading back to commence her afternoon disciplines.

Zara has been making a concerted effort to comeback onto the equestrian scene over the last few months, following a break after the birth of her first child Mia with husband Mike Tindell in January.

She has enjoyed a triumphant return to competing after finishing in 11th place individually at the World Equestrian Games in France last month, while the Great Britain team took silver. 

However, the royal is not letting her return to work impede her role as a mother. 

Unusually Zara has admitted she does not have a nanny, describing herself as a 'full-time mother' as well as a professional sportswoman.

But she joked of her firstborn: 'I'm going to keep her away from horses and rugby!'
