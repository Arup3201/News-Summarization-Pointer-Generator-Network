A 22-year-old driver has crawled his way out of an Arizona canyon two days after his car went over the cliff edge.

The unnamed man was travelling along State Route 88 at Tortilla Flat, northeast of Apache Junction, on Wednesday night when his Nissan Sentra swerved off the road.

The black car plunged more than 300ft, before landing on its roof at the bottom of Fish Creek canyon.

The driver, who was badly injured in the crash, remained inside the vehicle on Thursday in the hope that he would be found, according toFox 10.

But after realizing help would not come, he finally decided to crawl out of the vast canyon, before walking more than two miles to get aid. 

Yesterday morning, the man staggered into a Superstition restaurant and saloon and told staff he was in an accident, the Arizona Department of Public Safety said.

His Nissan was later discovered lying mangled on the floor of the canyon, according to 3TV.

Canyon: The man was taken to a Mesa hospital with serious, but non-life-threatening injuries. He is said to remain in a 'stable' condition. Above, Fish Creek canyon, where the man drove his car over the cliff edge

'This vehicle was in a place where nobody either noticed it or did anything about,' said Colin Williams, of the Rural Metro Fire Dept.

The man was taken to a Mesa hospital with serious, but non-life-threatening, injuries. He is said to remain in a 'stable' condition.

'Based on information we have reason to believe that those injuries were pretty serious at the time,' said Mr Williams. 

It is not the first time a car has plunged over a cliff at Tortilla Flat.

Road: It is not yet known what caused the  driver to swerve off State Route 88 (pictured) at Tortilla Flat

Earlier this year, a man was killed and another  injured when their vehicle fell down a 250ft canyon while they were driving along a treacherous part of Highway 88.

It took firefighters around three hours to rescue the 21-year-old passenger from the bottom of the cliff, according to reports.

The 20-year-old driver, a student at the University of Oklahoma, died after his side of the car was smashed by boulders.

It is unknown what caused this week's crash. An investigation is ongoing.
