He's not set to stomp onto our screens until 2014, but Godzilla already appears to be making his mark.

These eerie images capture an abandoned Japanese fishing village, recreated in Steveston, Canada, for filming of the remake of the 1954 classic.

The blockbuster, scheduled for release in May next year, revolves around the mythical prehistoric creature which terrorises Tokyo - and leaves a trail of destruction in the countryside.

Blockbuster: The new Godzilla will star Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen

Creators have said their latest version, which will star Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen, will stay more faithful to the original Japanese version.

And judging by these pictures, producers are making every effort to make it as authentic as possible.

Fishing boats lie marooned and abandoned in between run down old shacks and warning signs filled with Japanese writing.

The spectre of Godzilla looms large everywhere.

Terror: In the original tale Godzilla is said to be the result of a nuclear explosion and lives in the sea

Destruction: Godzilla has fiery atomic breath which raises the Japanese fishing villages to the ground

According to the original tale, the sea beast is blamed by fishermen for their poor yields.

Investigating scientists, led by main character Dr. Yamane, are at first skeptical. But after being confronted by Godzilla, conclude that he is the result of a nuclear explosion.

His encounters with human civilization result in a wave of destruction as his fiery atomic breath razed entire villages to the ground.

The race is on to find a way of stopping the powerful creature before he destroys mankind.

Since the 1954 film, Godzilla has become a worldwide pop culture icon, appearing in scores of films, video games, novels, comic books and TV series.

The seaside town of Steveston, in Vancouver, Canada, has historic connections with Japanese fishermen, as large numbers settled there to work in the salmon canning industry.

It as also been used a location for the TV show Once Upon A Time.

The remake of Godzilla, which is rumoured to have a 
budget of more than a $100million, will be Hollywood's second attempt to
recreate the classic.

A 1998 version, starring Matthew Broderick, grossed almost $380million worldwide but was widely considered a flop.
