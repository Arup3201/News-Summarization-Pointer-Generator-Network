It's high summer and for those going on a beach break, it's time to unveil our bodies in the blinding sunshine.

We've all got our insecurities: most of us have wobbly bits we'd like to change and pore over images of celebrity bodies, wishing we had the Duchess of Cambridge's slim legs or Lucy Meck's rock-hard abs.

To this end, a new study polled both men and women on what parts would make up their ideal beach body if they could choose from any British celebrity.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likes of David Beckham and the Duchess of Cambridge featured along with popular sports personalities and reality TV stars.

Is this the perfect human? A new study quizzed men and women on which celebrities had the best body parts and they created the 'perfect' celebrity beach body based on the results

For men, sports and movie stars were the popular choices, with Harry Styles' hair, David Beckham's face and Tom Hardy's beard forming the top half.

Geordie Shore's Scott Timlin's torso, footballer Jack Wilshere's arms and Frank Lampard's legs make up the rest of the perfect celebrity man.

Myleene Klass' face shape, Holly Willoughby's hair,  Keira Knightley's eyes and brows, and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's smile and dimples combine to form the 'perfect' celebrity female face.

Hot body: The ideal female body comprises Lucy Mecklenburgh's stomach, Kelly Brook's boobs, the Duchess of Cambridge's legs and Jessica Ennis' arms

Lucy Mecklenburgh's stomach, Kelly Brook's boobs, the Duchess of Cambridge's legs and Jessica Ennis' arms made up the perfect female physique.

As ever, the sum looks a lot less appealing than the parts. Kelly Brook's breasts and Kate's coltish legs look rather unlikely - and top-heavy - when spliced together. Keira Knightley's dark doe eyes and Holly Willoughby's tumbling flaxen mane don't quite gel either.

The men fare slightly better, with the finished result slightly resembling Bradley Cooper.

A spokesperson for My Voucher Codes, who created the images, said: 'It’s interesting to see what each sex would choose for their ideal beach body.

'I’m
 sure we would see different results if it was chosen for the opposite 
sex.'
