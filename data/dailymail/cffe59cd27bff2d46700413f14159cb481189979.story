Men settle on their favourite hairstyle when they reach the age of 32 after trying five different cuts, a study claims.

Women on the other hand typically test out seven styles before finding the one they want to keep long-term.

Male celebrities who have sported the same signature hairstyle since they were 32 include rock stars Mick Jagger, 69, David Bowie, 66, and Rod Stewart, 68.

Old classics: Mick Jagger’s (left) hairstyle has changed little since his days in the Rolling Stones and fellow rocker Rod Stewart’s (right) is much the same as when he was 32

Sticking around: Actors Ryan Gosling, left, and Jake Gyllenhaal, right, are both 32 now so could have the same hairstyle for the forseeable future

Reasons men gave for sticking with just one style vary from it being convenient (65 per cent) to admitting that it was because their partner likes it (10 per cent).

Actors Ryan Gosling and Jake Gyllenhaal and singer Justin Timberlake are 32 now so are likely to adopt their current haircuts for the foreseeable future.

The study of 2,000 people, carried out by hair brand Fudge, also looked into the influence celebrity hairstyles have on British men and the appeal of haircuts which would not  typically be seen as fashionable.

One in five admit they want to grow their hair longer to copy the likes of David Beckham and actor Bradley Cooper, while a quarter think that London Mayor Boris Johnson’s blond mop works.

Another 17 per cent rate Bradley Wiggins’ muttonchop sideburns as cool – although, at 33, the cyclist has now moved on to a less-recognisable style and shaved them off.

Two thirds said they would prefer to go grey like Clooney, than start to recede.

And 12 per cent of men would even consider dying their hair grey to keep up with fashion trends - surprisingly, six per cent have already done so.

John Vial, from Fudge, said: 'There is a common misconception about men not being influenced by hair trends.

'Yet, these findings show British men make a significant number of attempts to find their signature style, just two less than the average woman.

'A hairstyle that reflects your personality is a clear priority for the modern man.

'And it’s great to see the influence greying celebrities are having on men too.'
