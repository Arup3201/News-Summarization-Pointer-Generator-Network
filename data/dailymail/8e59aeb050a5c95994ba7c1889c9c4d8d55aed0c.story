Celtic are facing a fifth UEFA charge in just three years after European football's governing body announced it has opened disciplinary proceedings against Celtic for 'crowd disturbances' during their match with Dinamo Zagreb.

A UEFA statement read: 'Disciplinary proceedings have been opened following the UEFA Europa League Group D match between GNK Dinamo Zagreb and Celtic FC played on 11 December in Croatia.'

It is the fifth time within the last three years Celtic have been hit with charges because of the behaviour of their supporters during European matches.

After the most recent incident - when an 'illicit' banner was unfurled at a Champions League match with AC Milan in 2013 – it resulted in a £42,000 fine and the club's chief executive Peter Lawwell condemned the 'small minority' of supporters who were 'damaging the reputation' of Celtic.

A £4,221 was handed down earlier that year after fireworks were set off by supporters during their Champions League qualifier with Cliftonville.

The club's fans also caused them to be fined twice during their Europa League campaign in the 2011/12 season.

In March 2012, UEFA fined Celtic £21,000 after supporters displayed an offensive banner and set off flares during an away game with Udinese.

Celtic were also fined £13,000 for 'illicit chanting' in the same competition during a match with Rennes in 2011.

Given the high volume of supporter-related incidents, Celtic now run the risk of a more severe sanction over and above a financial penalty.
