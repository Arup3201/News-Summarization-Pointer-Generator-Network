A cigarette case presented by the world’s most famous crime novelist Agatha Christie to the saxophonist who found her after she disappeared in 1926 is expected to fetch £10,000 at auction.

The beautiful silver box was given to musician Bob Leeming as a thank you from the author after he spotted Agatha at a hotel in Yorkshire.

Leeming’s sighting brought to an end 11 days of frantic searching for the troubled writer who had vanished from her sprawling Devon home on December 3.

Thank you present: Agatha Christie gave saxophonist Bob Leeming this beautiful cigarette holder after he found her at a hotel in 
Yorkshire following her disappearance in 1926. It is engraved with the 
words 'With best wishes Col. & Mrs Christie'

Valuable: The King George V cigarette box is expected to fetch £10,000 when it is auctioned at Sotheby's in London next month

The woman famed for scribing gripping whodunits had left authorities scratching their heads about her whereabouts and efforts to find her involved a reported 500 officers, tracker dogs, dredging water courses and even an aeroplane.

In the end she was discovered holed up at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Yorkshire on December 14.

The King George V case is inscribed with the words: 'With our best wishes, Col. & Mrs Christie' and has been passed on through several generations of the Leeming family.

Troubled time: Agatha Christie, pictured, disappeared for 11 days as she suffered a nervous breakdown following the death of her mother Clara Miller and her husband's announcement that he wanted a divorce

Now the highly sought after item is going under the hammer at Sotheby's auction house in London on July 10 and is expected to fetch a staggering £10,000.

It is still thought Agatha's disappearance was triggered by her mother Clara Miller’s recent death from bronchitis.

Her first husband Archie had been in Spain when Agatha’s mother became sick and because he ‘hated illness, death and trouble’ he left her to deal with the death herself.

She began to show symptoms of nervous breakdown, for example bursting into tears when her car 
wouldn’t start and having trouble remembering her name.

Agatha
received some relief when her book The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was released 
June.

The novel thrust her into the literary stratosphere and after 
clearing out her mother’s old house she was able to return to hers and 
Archie's home of Styles.

However,
Archie’s announcement that he had fallen for another woman, Nancy Neele,
and that he wanted an immediate divorce brought her further pain.

The pair 
separated, but had a temporary reconciliation which Agatha later said was a ‘mistake’ that led to ‘a period of sorrow, misery and heartbreak.’

It is these factors which are thought
to have led to Agatha’s disappearance. The writer claimed she 
remembered nothing about how she arrived in Harrogate, Yorkshire.

She eventually divorced her husband in 1928 before going on to marry archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan in 1930.

In
2006, biographer Andrew Norman, in his study of the writer's life, 
claimed that when she went disappeared Agatha was in the grip of a 
rare medical condition named 'fugue state' and was in a trance for 
several days.

Agatha,
who also wrote under the name Mary Westmacott, died in 1976 having 
written more than 70 detective novels, most famously Hercule Poirot and 
Miss Jane Marple

Big story: The Daily Sketch on December 15, 1926, devoted the whole of its front page to Agatha Christie being found safe and well after her mystery disappearance
