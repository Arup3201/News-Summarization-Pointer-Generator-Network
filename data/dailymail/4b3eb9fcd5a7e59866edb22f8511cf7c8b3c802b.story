Police have confirmed that the 999 call from a three-year-old girl to report her mother had fallen and was not moving was a hoax.

Detectives investigating a 999 call to the ambulance service which claimed to be a three-year-old girl called 'Ellie' reporting her mother collapsed at home have now established the call was made by two ten-year-old girls.

Unusually the number that made the call was not identifiable and could not initially be traced, prompting a frantic search for vulnerable 'Ellie'.

URGENT APPEAL below

Urgent: Dr David Macklin, from Yorkshire Ambulance Service and Lisa Griffin, Detective Chief Inspector, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team were urgently looking for 'Ellie'

A team of detectives from West Yorkshire
Police’s Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, made wide-ranging 
inquiries to trace the family, including checks on police systems, 
hospitals, and the public register of births.

Today the mobile phone number was 
traced to a Bridlington address where two ten-year-old girls living 
there were identified and have been spoken to by officers this 
afternoon.

Officers are now liaising with the girls’ parents and partner agencies to take appropriate action. They have not been arrested.

Detective Chief Inspector Lisa 
Griffin, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'We are pleased 
that our investigation has shown that we don’t have a vulnerable little 
girl out there with her mum collapsed beside her, although it is 
obviously incredibly frustrating that this has turned out to be a hoax.

'We treated the call as genuine on 
the basis of what was said what could be established in the initial 
stages of the investigation.

The girls had told the operator the girl's name as 'Ellie' and her mother was called Stacey Hall.

Search: The little girl clearly said that she lived in Leeds

'Ellie' said her house number was 23 
and had 'Court' in the street name and said she lived in Leeds and her 
grandparents lived in Bridlington, East Yorkshire.

During the call, which lasted 33 
minutes, 'Ellie' told the call-handler that she was nearly four years old 
and that her mother had fallen over and would not get up.

She said she had shouted at her mother
and wiggled her but she remained on the kitchen floor with a piece of 
toast in her hand, not moving.

'Ellie' had worried 999 by saying the 
front and back door were locked and she could not get out of the house, 
prompting fears she was vulnerable and alone with a sick mother.

Police traced a number of women called Stacey Hall to eliminate from the inquiry.

Detective Chief Inspector Griffin added: 'We are very grateful to the public and 
the media for all the support they have given us in appealing for 
information over this incident.

'Our priority is always to help the public and protect life as was our overriding focus in this investigation.

'This incident again highlights how 
misuse of the 999 system can cause significant unnecessary work for the 
emergency services who have limited resources to deal with genuine calls
for help from members of the public.

'We hope it will help to remind people of the serious consequences of misusing the 999 system.'
