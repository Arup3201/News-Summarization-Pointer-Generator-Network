He is widely considered to be the modest man of middle-distance running and a gentleman of the sporting world.

But when it comes to winning, it seems that Mo Farah can be just as much a glory-hunter as anyone.

When asked who should win BBC Sports Personality of the Year, the double Olympic champion answered honestly  – and put his own name forward.

Going for glory: Olympic gold medallist - and MoBot originator - Mo Farah tipped himself as the winner of BBC's Sports Personality of the Year award

The father of twins was the only one of the shortlist of 12 nominees to name himself when asked by Radio Times who they would vote for if they could.

‘I want to win it myself,’ said the 29-year-old who brought the house down at the Olympic Stadium when he won the 5,000 and 10,000 metres and set off a craze with his MoBot celebration.

He must fend off stiff competition if he is to win the prestigious honour.

Olympic and Paralympic champions dominate the shortlist for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.

Tennis
 ace Andy Murray, cyclists Sir Chris Hoy and Bradley Wiggins, athletes 
Mo Farah and David Weir, sailor Ben Ainslie plus golfer Rory McIlroy are
 in the mix for the coveted top award.

Cover stars: Favourite to win, according to bookmakers, is Bradley Wiggins, followed by Mo Farah, Andy Murray and Jessica Ennis who told the Radio Times she 'hasn't touched the ground' since her win

Heptathlete
 Jessica Ennis, cyclist Sarah Storey, boxer Nicola Adams, swimmer Ellie 
Simmonds and rower Katherine Grainger are also in the running.

In any other year, at least four of the stars could expect to walk away with the trophy.

Tennis ace Andy Murray, 27, not only won Olympic gold but also the US Open.

Bradley Wiggins won his fourth  Olympic gold medal just 10 days after becoming the first British rider to win the Tour de France. He was also the sportsman most of the other nominees said they would like to see win.

Rory McIlroy established himself as world No.1 golfer, winning the USPGA Championship. He was also a member of the dramatic Ryder Cup-winning team. The 23-year-old was the only one of the 12 nominees not to have won gold at London 2012.

Heptathlete and London 2012 poster 
girl Jessica Ennis is another of the favourites to win. She told Radio 
Times this week: ‘We need more coverage of women’s sport, and we need to
 get women involved in coaching and administration.’

Cyclist Bradley Wiggins, 32, is tipped
 to triumph, with bookmakers Ladbrokes naming him the odds-on favourite 
at 2/5. Farah is second favourite at 5/1, then Murray at 8/1, while 
Ennis is 10/1.

Not a single woman made it on to last year's final shortlist despite a strong year of competition.

The controversy triggered a review of the process for this year's event, which has also produced a shortlist that includes two more sports personalities than usual. An expert panel has also been introduced.

After a golden summer of home-grown sport including the London 2012 Games, the event promises to be the biggest in the programme's 59-year history.

It is being held at London's ExCeL centre on December 16.

There is no place on the list for cyclist Jason Kenny who won two golds at London 2012 to add to the gold and silver medal he had already clinched at the Beijing 2008 Olympics.

On the list: Tennis ace Andy Murray, seen lifting the US Open championship trophy in September, has been nominated

Inspiring: Paralympians Sarah Storey and Ellie Simmons are on the prestigious shortlist for 2012

Golden girls: Boxer Nicola Adams and rower Katherine Grainger celebrating their Olympic wins this summer

Cyclist Laura Trott, another double gold medallist at London 2012, is also missing.

The impressive performance of triathlete Alistair Brownlee in clinching gold at the Olympics was not enough to get him on the list.

There is also no place for star names including Paralympic T44 100m champion Jonnie Peacock and para-equestrian rider Sophie Christiansen whose golden hat trick at London 2012 means she now has five golds, a silver and bronze medal from three Paralympics.

Leaving these deserving athletes off the list was 'very difficult,' according to Barbara Slater, the BBC's sport director.

She wrote in her blog: 'The panel also reflected long and hard on the heroics of stars from other sports such as (Europe's Ryder Cup golf hero) Ian Poulter during the "miracle of Medinah", the continued brilliance of Carl Froch and the "magnificent seven" from Champion Jockey Richard Hughes - in any other year these sportspeople would probably be front-runners to win the overall award.

'If we ever needed reminding just how special a sporting year it has been, then the list of those sportspeople who did not make the final 12 is testament to that.'

The prizes for Team of the Year, Coach of the Year and the Overseas Personality Award are to be decided by the expert panel.

Jessica EnnisHeptathlete, 26Won gold with record points in the heptathlon at the Olympics and was dubbed the face of London 2012.
