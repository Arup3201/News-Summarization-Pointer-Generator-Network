He may have had a glorious World Cup, scoring four goals as the poster boy of Brazilian football before his horrendous back injury, but Neymar had a moment to forget against Ecuador.

With Brazil leading 1-0 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey in the 47th minute, the ball was squared for Neymar, who was unmarked in the centre.

With the goal gaping and no 'keeper or defence in sight, the 22-year-old stuck out his left leg to try and poke the ball home from four yards.

Teed up: The ball was crossed for Neymar who was unmarked in the box against Ecuador on Tuesday

Connection: Neymar got his foot too far under the ball and that caused it to head up and on to the crossbar

Unfortunate: Neymar could not react quick enough to the rebound off the bar either and did not score

Incredibly, however, the Barcelona forward - who was captain for the second match in a row - could only manage to rattle the crossbar with his finish after getting his foot too far under the ball.

And Neymar's nightmare was not over then, either.

As the ball rebounded towards him, Neymar was unable to sort his feet out in time and the ball was cleared by the Ecuadorian defence.

Thankfully for the forward who has netted 36 times in just 56 internationals, the miss did not prove costly as Brazil held on to preserve new coach Dunga's unbeaten start to his reign.

In fact, Neymar was the architect of the winner.

On the half-hour mark, the striker curled a delightful free-kick over the Ecuadorian defence and into the path of Willian, who controlled it and finished well with the outside of his right foot.

The Chelsea midfielder's strike not only spared Neymar's blushes, it also gave Brazil a 1-0 victory in the friendly on Tuesday.

And Neymar will surely be hoping he can find his finishing boots by the time he faces Athletic Bilbao at the Nou Camp for Barca on Saturday.
