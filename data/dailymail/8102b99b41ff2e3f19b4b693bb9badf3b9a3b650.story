He is the ‘Master of Movement’, capturing our sporting icons at work in drawings that explode from the page with vibrancy and colour.

And now Paul Trevillion’s stellar 50-year career is being marked with an exhibition in central London, with dozens of familiar faces on display.

Over the years, Trevillion has immortalised the likes of Pele, Bobby Moore, Cristiano Ronaldo, Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer, Sir Ian Botham, Sachin Tendulkar and Andy Murray - to name but a few.

Taking a walk through the Strand Gallery is to stroll through a portal of sporting memories, some still fresh and others sepia-tinged from a bygone age.

The lower level is a Who’s Who of football legends and British Olympic heroes, all captured with the flow and dynamism that carried them to the pinnacle of their professions.

We see the exhausted smile of Sir Bradley Wiggins, his lyrca unzipped, as he acknowledges the roar of the Velodrome crowd after yet another gold medal triumph.

We see the phenomenal stride of Usain Bolt - and few can capture the effortless, gigantic gallop of the Jamaican like Trevillion - as he smashes another world record.

Best of the lot: Pele bursting from the wall in a haze of colour and (right), the jewel in the collection, a portrait of the brilliant Brazilian masterfully crafted in just 50 minutes

Leading role: Bobby Moore's studied glance as he captains England and (right) Franz Beckenbauer's glance

So apt in a World Cup summer, we have represented those who know the incomparable rush of euphoria that comes with success of football’s greatest stage.

The studied expression of Moore - in that classic English red of 1966 - as he plays the ball from the back, the 60-yard glance of Beckenbauer as he carries West Germany forward in 1974, the look of elation on Paolo Rossi’s face as he scored for Italy in 1982.

And, at the end of the corridor, the best of them all. Pele, bursting from the wall in a haze of vivid colour, playing to an incessant samba beat that entranced the world in 1970.

The Brazilian icon appears upstairs as well, the jewel in the collection; a Pele portrait crafted in just 50 minutes in a swoosh of running inks, spun upside down at one point in the flash of creation but still ending in an uncanny likeness. It will set you back £50,000 but see it as a worthy investment.

Elation: Paolo Rossi's emotion captured as he scores for Italy in 1982 and (right) the poise of Diego Maradona

Spectacular: Both the execution of Gerd Muller's overhead kick and the capturing of the moment

Modern heroes: Barcelona's Argentinian star Lionel Messi and (right) Cristiano Ronaldo, then of Man Utd

Elsewhere, the chapter of Genesis for Trevillion; sketches from the Roy of the Rovers comic strips. Roy Race and his Melchester team-mates looking as magical now as they did back in 1963.

Fans of a certain age who lapped up Roy’s adventures on a weekly basis now have the opportunity, for the first time, to own an original sketch or proof from this immensely popular series.

Cricket is well represented here, with Trevillion capturing the stride of Tendulkar as he drives another delivery to the boundary, while there are lovely tribute sketches to Botham and David Gower in their pomp.

There’s the strain in Andy Murray’s face as he serves for victory at Wimbledon, the reach of Michael Jordan as he wows the fans with another slam dunk, and the accurate boot of Jonny Wilkinson as he slots another three points for England.

There is truly something for everyone from a man who has drawn - always in ink, never oil pastels or paints - for publications such as Eagle, the Daily Mirror, Daily Express, The Sun, The Daily Telegraph and The Times.

Of course, many have appeared exclusively in the pages of the Daily Mail and on MailOnline.

Visitors to the Strand Gallery have the opportunity to purchase original artwork and signed limited edition copies of Trevillion’s greatest works, or simply admire their idols in full flow.

‘I got my first pencil at six months old and realised I could draw. I learned at six to make the medium of ink work for me, then learned to work faster, got better and quicker.’

‘I want people to be able to afford them and to buy them,’ Trevillion says. ‘I wanted the people who stand on the terraces to be able to afford them.

‘These are an investment. They will gain another three noughts in a few years. Mortgage the house, sell the car, buy one. It’ll be worth £70million before I die!’

Paul Trevillion’s exhibition opens at The Strand Gallery from Wednesday, June 18 until Saturday, July 5 (11am-6pm). Admission is free.
