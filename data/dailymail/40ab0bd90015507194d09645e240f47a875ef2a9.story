She enjoyed a successful swimming career and is passionate about teaching Monégasque children about taking to the water safely through her charitable foundation.

Now Princess Charlene of Monaco has been unveiled as an ambassadress for Peace and Sport, an organisation that promotes global harmony through physical exercise.

The body's newest royal patron made her debut appearance for the charity last night at the 7th Peace and Sport Forum Awards in Monte Carlo.

Elegant: The 35-year-old princess, pictured with Jacques Rogge, was demure in a chic black dress

Elegant in a knee-length black dress that showed off her toned arms and shoulders to perfection, the South African born royal appeared on stage to present one of the awards during the ceremony.

In the spectacular Salle des Etoiles [room of stars] inside the stadium of local team Sporting Monte-Carlo, the award for best picture was handed by Princess Charlene to Emmanuel Dunant, the AFP photographer behind a striking image depicting tennis star Novak Djokovic appearing at the UN.

Other winners on the night included Sébastien Bouche, a French rugby league star who took home the prestigious Champion of the Year award and the Oceania Football Federation which took the prize for Football Federation of the Year thanks to its Just Play initiative.

Djokovic himself joined other guests at the glittering event, who also included the former president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge.

Glamorous: The Monégasque princess wore her hair swept off her face and kept her make-up typically low key

Peace: The charity was set up by Joel Bouzou seven years ago and has Charlene as an ambassador

But one star who missed the show was Charlene's husband, Prince Albert of Monaco, who despite being another patron of Peace and Sport, was unable to attend the event.

As a result, this is the second time in a week that the 35-year-old princess has appeared solo at an awards ceremony.

Last Friday the princess was in New York to attend the Princess Grace Awards Gala, a function dedicated to recognising young talent who excel in the world of theatre and dance.
