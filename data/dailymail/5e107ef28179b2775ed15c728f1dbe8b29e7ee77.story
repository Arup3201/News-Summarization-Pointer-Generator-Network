A 27-year-old childcare director has been arrested after she allegedly falsely claimed more than $3 million worth of child care subsidies meant to fund care for children who are abused, neglected or disadvantaged.

The woman, Melissa Higgins, is the director of the family day care centre Aussie Giggles in the Albury Wodonga area, on the New South Wales-Victoria border, the ABC reported.

Australian Federal Police officers seized $2.1 million in cash, a $90,000 car and a number of other items after searching a number of properties in the Albury-Wodonga area connected to Ms Higgins.

The 27-year-old was arrested on Monday and charged with three counts of Obtaining a Financial Benefit By Deception.

Police will allege Ms Higgins started fraudulently claiming Special Child Care Subsidies (SCCB), worth more than $3 million, in December 2013.

SCCB is a payment that subsidises up to the full cost of child care for a child who is at risk of serious abuse or neglect, or where the child's family is experiencing temporary financial hardship.

Ms Higgins' Aussie Giggles is a family day care provider, meaning she cares for children in her own home.

Her arrest is a result of a joint AFP, Department of Human Services (DHS) and Department of Social Services (DSS) investigation after the agencies discovered irregularities in payments.

Ms Higgins will appear in Albury Local Court in May.

AFP Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre manager Linda Champion said: 'Investigations like this send a clear message to anyone who is thinking of engaging in this type of [alleged] criminal activity – collectively we have proven our ability to investigate and take action, as we have done today.'

General Manager DHS, Hank Jongen said fraud would not be tolerated.

'If there are people out there who think they can get away with fraud, they need to think again,' Mr Jongen said.

'It is only a matter of time before we catch up with them, and when we do, we will make sure they are dealt with in the courts.'

A DSS spokesperson said child care services that did the wrong thing were on notice.

'DSS takes non-compliance very seriously and, as demonstrated in this case today, will use all means available to us to enforce the law where the evidence warrants it.'
