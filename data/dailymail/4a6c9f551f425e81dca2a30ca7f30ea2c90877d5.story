From the outside, Ukraine's Ministry of Revenue building looks rather non-descript.

But step inside and a secret world of pleasure awaits... at least it did until the country's government collapsed in February amid violent protests.

Instead of the standard company gym, tax officials had an array of luxuries to keep them entertained - from a giant jacuzzi and boxing gym to a sauna, massage tables, and even a salt room.

Ukraine's Ministry of Revenue building looks rather non-descript from the outside but it houses many surprises, including a boxing gym

Phil Black (front left), from CNN, was recently given a guided tour of the premises, which revealed the astonishing extent of corruption while the country was under the watch of now ex-president Viktor Vanukovych. Above, the massive jacuzzi in one of the 'secret' rooms

Phil Black, from CNN, was recently given a guided tour of the premises, which revealed the astonishing extent of corruption while the country was under the watch of now ex-president Viktor Vanukovych.

Behind one locked door, for example, lies a boxer's paradise.

Lower-level tax workers assumed the room contained a secret jail, as they often heard yelling from within.

The noise was, in fact, bareknuckle fighting matches which were put on for the entertainment of government VIPs.

Another room reveals even more surprises... and is just the place to unwind after a hard day's work milking the system.

Behold the massive jacuzzi (with complicated control panel); angelic fresco on the ceiling; a deluxe sauna; plus a cold-water bucket room for that post-steam cool-down.

Right up there in 'things least likely to be found in a tax office'... a stand-up tanning booth

The salt room - walls, floor, and ceiling covered in sodium chloride - was also made available to dignitaries of the corrupt regime

After a busy day massaging the figures, what better way to unwind than a trip to the massage table?

The average Ukrainian wage is less than a dollar an hour - but such details did nothing to assuage the guilt of the government cronies.

And it was a different sort of guilt - namely gilt - which greeted dignitaries when they went to the bathroom: gold glitter decorations at every turn to make the call of nature that much more bearable.

Down the hall lie yet more forms of relaxation: a cryo sauna - a form of extreme cold therapy - for the elite; and a stand-up tanning booth.Â 

And finally, the piece de resistance in the last chamber: a salt room.

Here, the walls, floor and ceiling are all covered in the white stuff, which is apparently good for you to breathe in.

It's just a shame they didn't care so much about the health of their country.

Spending a penny? More like spending a fortune in the tax office bathroom

The exterior of the revenue office gives little away to reveal the extravagances that lie within

Anything to say, tax minister Klimenko?

The former minister responsible for the tax office, Alexandr Klimenko, was unavailable for comment.

According to security video, he was last seen fighting his way through a metal detector at Donetsk airport as he made a desperate attempt to flee the country.

The footage, from February 22, appears to show Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka, Klimenko and their bodyguards in chaotic tussles.

The pair, who were close allies of Vanukovych, were blocked from leaving the country.

It was the same day Pshonka was ousted from the fast-collapsing regime with a vote of no confidence in Ukraine's parliament, as deadly clashes raged in the streets of the capital Kiev.

Days later, Pshonka's opulent mansion near the capital Kiev was stormed by anti-government protesters, who revealed it was filled with crystal chandeliers and plush golden furniture.

Opulent to the extreme, the lavish estate was just one of several extravagant homes inhabited by the country's former leaders and top officials.

The house in the village of Gorenichy outside Kiev was having its value assessed by experts after its owner went on the run.

However, it was only one of Pshonka's homes. He also had the use of a hunting lodge around 20 miles away on a compound with two other lodges, one of them for the use of the deposed president Yanukovych.

The hunting estate was also entered by opposition activists, who reportedly found guns and removed files.

The scale of the opulence of homes used by public officials is seen by opposition activists as proof of large-scale corruption among the country's elite, one of the key causes of public anger which led to the protests in Kiev and other cities.
