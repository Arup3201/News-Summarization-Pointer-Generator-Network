Newly elected Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst will deliver the Republican Party's official response next Tuesday after President Barack Obama's delivers his State of the Union address, marking the first such honor for a politician best known for castrating hogs in her youth.

Ernst, 44, is the first woman to serve in Congress from the state of Iowa, winning a seat that Democrat Tom Harkin had held for two decades. 

She won't break any ground for the GOP on Tuesday, however: Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers delivered the response speech last year. Republicans gave the job to women three times during the Bill Clinton presidency.

LET'S MAKE 'EM SQUEAL: Ernst came to prominence with a folksy ad that emphasized her childhood chore castrating hogs on a farm

The newly minted Iowa senator could take on any number of Obama-favored policies in her speech next Tuesday, including the Affordable Care Act

But her fresh face will present what the president's opponents hope is a personable image going into the 2016 election season. 

Ernst made national news last year when she launched her campaign with a TV ad playing up a childhood that she spent working on her family's farm – including some chuckle-worthy chores. 

'I grew up castrating pigs on an Iowa farm,' she said in the campaign ad.

'So when I get to Washington, I'll know how to cut pork.'

After a message flashes across the screen about balancing the federal budget, she comes back to observe that 'Washington's full of big spenders. Let's make 'em squeal!' 

A House Republican staffer told DailyMail.com that Ernst was picked in part because of the ad and the public name-recognition it gave her.

The aide, who requested anonymity, said Ernst 'will be a breath of fresh air, and hopefully she'll do what she does best: cut someone's cojones off.' 

Top Republicans beamed on Thursday as they announced their pick.

Republicans have put up seven different speakers to respond to President Barack Obama's State of the Union speeches, including the 2009 address which was considered merely an 'address to a joint session of Congress':

February 24, 2009 – Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal

January 27, 2010 – Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell

January 25, 2011 – Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan

January 24, 2012 – Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels

February 12, 2013 – Florida Senator Marco Rubio

January 28, 2014 – Washington Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers

January 20, 2015 – Iowa Senator Joni Ernst 

'She is a perfect choice. Americans voted for change,' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said, standing alongside House Speaker John Boehner.

They spoke at a joint retreat of House and Senate Republicans in Hershey, Pennsylvania. 

Ernst is an Iraq War veteran and lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard.

She told reporters that when she was growing up on a farm in Southwest Iowa, she never would have imagined having such an opportunity. 

'Our folks back home sent us to Washington, D.C., with a clear mission and that mission is to get to work,' she said.

'I am truly honored,' she added in a written statement. 

'During this Congress, we must help grow a vibrant economy, see to it that our veterans receive promised quality care and that our military has the tools to defend our nation's security, and ensure the federal government begins to run more effectively and efficiently.' 

A WOMAN'S PLACE IS IN THE HOUSE: Cathy McMorris Rodgers, now part of the GOP House leadership team, gave the response address last year

AWKWARD: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio became an Internet sensation when he paused for a drink in the middle of his speech

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (left) responded to Obama in 2009 and gave a wooden performance that was widely mocked; in 2010 it was then-Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell's turn (right) – but he'll soon be giving all his speeches from behind bars

McConnell boasted that Ernst 'is a mother, a soldier, and an independent leader who serves in Washington because Americans voted for change in the last election.'

Boehner said 'she knows that our federal government is too big, our spending is too high, and our tax code is broken. And, she knows first-hand the sacrifices our men and women in uniform make to keep us all safe in a dangerous world.' 

Obama delivers the State of the Union address on Tuesday. 

It is customary for the party not in power in the White House to be granted national television time for a response to the president's speech. In this case, Republicans hold control of both houses of Congress for the first time since Obama took office in 2009.

Delivering the response to the State of the Union can sometimes prove a perilous turn in the spotlight.

Two years ago, Sen. Marco Rubio was ridiculed after lurching for a drink of water in the middle of his response, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is still remembered for his awkward performance back in 2009.

Virginia's then-Gov. Bob McDonnell had the honor in 2010. He's scheduled to report to federal prison on Feb. 9 to begin a two-year sentence for corruption in office.
