First Lady Michelle Obama's healthy eating initiatives have been so 
unpopular among young people that more than a million students have 
stopped buying school lunches.

The Agriculture Department set new 
standards for what types of foods schools can serve students that have been 
phased in over the last three school years in response to Obama's push for healthier school lunches, and even more changes are coming in 
2014.

Already, data from the department shows that a total of 1.1 million children abandoned the National School Lunch program between the 2011 and 2013 school years after Obama went to war over what's on their trays.

And among students whose meals are not subsidized by the government, the number is even higher - totaling 1.6 million.

Not having it: First Lady Michelle Obama's healthy eating initiatives have been so unpopular among young people that more than a million students have stopped buying school lunches

If only Michelle Obama's regs on school lunches were as popular with kids as her dance moves were yesterday during the first-ever White House Talent Show

First Lady Michelle Obama joins the lunch line at Parklawn Elementary School in Alexandria, Virginia on January 25, 2012. Obama made the visit to speak about the United States Department of Agriculture's new nutrition standards for school lunches

In announcing the changes to school lunches in January of 2012, Michelle Obama said that, 'Schools are finding that when they actually offer these healthier 
options, kids aren’t just willing to try them, they actually like them. 
That's the thing, that's the surprising thing.

'I've been 
to so many schools across the country where parents see their kids 
eating fresh vegetables off the vine, kids they say would never try 
anything, but that's the beauty of children — they change,' the First Lady said.

But since then many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly.

The rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond.

Schools pushing for changes say limits on sodium and requirements for whole grains have proven particularly difficult, while some school officials say kids are throwing fruits and vegetables they are required to take in the trash.

'I am talking to the lunch ladies who do all this work and it is thrown in the garbage at the end of the day,' Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt told The Hill.

House Republicans are proposing to let
 some schools opt out of healthier school lunch and breakfast programs 
if they are losing money.

A 
GOP spending bill for agriculture and food programs released on Monday 
would allow schools to apply for temporary waivers if they have a net 
loss on school food programs for a six month period.

The House Appropriations Committee said in a release that the waiver language is in response to requests from schools.

The School Nutrition Association, which represents school nutrition directors and companies that sell food to schools, endorsed the provision on Monday and said that schools need more room to make their own decisions.

President Leah Schmidt said the group supports the one-year waiver as a temporary solution until Congress considers renewal of a school foods law that expires in 2015.

'School meal programs need more flexibility to plan menus that increase student consumption of healthy choices while limiting waste,' Schmidt said.

The School Nutrition Association says that almost half of school meal programs reported declines in revenue in the 2012-13 school year and 90 percent said food costs were up, leading 1,445 schools to quit the program.

Nutrition advocates and other supporters of the rules say it will take some time for schools to adjust and the House proposal is overly broad.

Margo Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest says the House Republicans are using a 'hacksaw rather than a scalpel' to try and solve problems some schools are having.

Wootan argues that there may be other factors in play such as enrollment or food costs if a lunch program is losing money.

'It's a shame that the House Republicans are taking a step backward and allowing schools to serve more unhealthy food to children,' she said.

'Why would Congress, already maligned for labeling pizza a vegetable —
 and I know something about pizza — now seek to weaken federal child 
nutrition programs, and through the appropriations process no less, 
other than to appease the industry?' Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro said on Tuesday.

The latest round of regulations handed down by the government requires public schools to serve more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables and less sodium and fat

In announcing changes to school lunches in January of 2012, Michelle Obama said that, 'Schools are finding that when they actually offer these healthier options, kids aren¿t just willing to try them, they actually like them. That's the thing, that's the surprising thing.

Congress passed the Healthy, 
Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010 just before Democrats lost control of the 
House of Representatives. The legislation places stricter regulations on
 what foods schools can and cannot serve students at lunch and in 
vending machines on school property.

Democrats passed the legislation as part of a plug for Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign.

Getting kids to eat healthier, and at school in particular, has been a major part of the First Lady's initiative.

'With
 more than 32 million children participating in the National School 
Lunch Program and more than 12 million participating in the School 
Breakfast Program, good nutrition at school is more important than 
ever,' the campaign's website says.

'Let’s Move! is committed to providing healthier foods in our nation’s 
schools, and encourages all schools to provide school breakfast.'

'The first lady has from day one made the health of our children a top 
priority, and that means keeping the pressure on to ensure that school 
nutrition standards already implemented by 90 percent of our schools 
stay intact,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Tuesday.

'The First Lady and this administration believe that every 
decision we make should be guided by sound science and hard evidence, 
not politics or special interests, particularly when it comes to the 
health of our children.'

The
 latest round of regulations handed down by the government requires 
public schools to serve more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables and 
less sodium and fat.

'As parents, we try to prepare decent meals, limit how much junk food 
our kids eat, and ensure they have a reasonably balanced diet,' Michelle Obama 
said at a 2012 event announcing of Department of Agriculture's new guidelines on school lunches.

'And when we're putting in all that effort, the last thing we want
 is for our hard work to be undone each day in the school cafeteria.'

The Senate Agricultural Appropriations committee's spending bill does not include the GOP's one-year waiver.

Instead, Republicans in the Senate will go after new limits on sodium in school lunches and the amount of whole grains schools have to serve.

If the GOP's legislation passes in either chambers, it would be a big blow to Michelle Obama and her healthy eating campaign, which has been unpopular among students.

'I blame Michelle Obama,' a student told The Wire earlier this month.'It's great that schools are trying to make 
lunches better, they're not doing a very good job of it.

'Starving kids 
at school isn't exactly a way to (get) kids' obesity down,' the student said.

The new rules are already showing wear and tear as student dissatisfaction with school meals rises.

On Tuesday the Department of Agriculture announced a two-year waiver of its own for schools having trouble meeting new regulations on whole-grains.

American public school students sick of the smaller portions and healthier offerings they get at lunch thanks to Michelle Obama's anti-obesity initiatives are sounding off on social media

Some students who less than thrilled about the new guidelines are blaming Michelle Obama directly for their unappetizing school lunches
