Andre Schurrle has blamed his unimpressive return to the Bundesliga on the lack of training he received during his time at Chelsea.

The World Cup winner left Stamford Bridge for Wolfsburg in a £22million deal in January, having previously starred for Mainz and Bayer Leverkusen in the German league.

After a bright start, setting up two goals against Hoffenheim on his debut, the 24-year-old admits he is 'stuck in a hole' after failing to make any impact in his last nine games.

Speaking to Bild, Schurrle suggested his poor form was a repercussion of his time spent at Stamford Bridge under Jose Mourinho.

'I'm still missing the last per cent,' he said. 'At top English clubs during the season the players are hardly loaded with any training, since it's almost all about regeneration and tactics. 

'In England you can get your fitness through the season with the games. At Chelsea because we had the championship, Champions League and the different club competitions, we played every three days.'

'In England there is no winter break. In the summer I had after the World Cup just two weeks of preparation. In January I had in the two weeks of the change almost no training because of back problems.'

Former Chelsea midfielder and Wolfsburg team-mate Kevin de Bruyne empathises with the German forward after suffering his own struggling start before impressing with 14 goals this term.

'I know it is hard for him, it was no different for me so I am not worried,'  De Bruyne told Wolfsburger Nachrichten.

However, Mohamed Salah has taken no time to settle at Fiorentina after joining the Italians on loan from Chelsea in February, scoring six goals in eight games for his new club. 

Meanwhile, Schurrle's girlfriend Montana York appears to be taking her beau's mind off things by introducing him to ice hockey at a recent Wolfsburg Grizzly Adams game.

The pair shared pictures wearing the team's colours on their Instagram accounts, with York commenting: 'finally a sport where I can teach him all the rules and terms'.
