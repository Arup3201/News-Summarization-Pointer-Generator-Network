These heartwarming pictures capture the incredible transformation of a poodle cross puppy who just two weeks ago was barely recognisable as a dog.

The one-year-old animal, called Dave, was one of nine of the breed found in a shocking state - caked in mud while blinded by their horrendously matted fur.

After being found on the side of the road in Winchester, the dogs were painstakingly shaved and nursed back to healthy by the RSPCA - with their touching story prompting more than £4,000 in donations to pay for their care.

What a difference! This heartwarming image captures the incredible transformation of Dave the poodle cross puppy, who just two weeks ago was severely ill anf blinded by its matted fur

Dave was pictured bounding around a garden today with astounding energy considering he was unable to walk two weeks ago, while also suffering from severe illness and depression.

It took rescuers around three hours to shave each dog, and so terrified were the animals of being touched that vets fear they may have been beaten by their owners. 

The total mass of hair weighed a staggering 12kg, filling three plastic bags.

All nine dogs are still being given medical treatment and will not be able to go to new homes until they are healthy and also micro-chipped and neutered.

Three different RSPCA centres are now taking care of the canines - Mount Noddy, Chichester, West Sussex and Ashley Heath and The Ark, both in Stubbington, Hants.

Donations for the dogs have flooded in from members of the public hoping to give the animals a healthy future - raising £4,298.77.

One couple, Roderick and Hazel Ross, from Warsash, Hants, pledged £2,000 to the cause.

And donations from as far as Canada came in after their heartbreaking story reached the country.

RSPCA inspector Jan Edwards said: 'There's a lot of love for these dogs. We have had masses of people wanting to re-home them.

'That amount of money is amazing. We are very very grateful for people that have given their hard earned cash.

'It's going to cost around that much to keep the dogs because they will all not be well enough for re-homing for some time.'

Speaking about the Ross' donation and Hazel, she said: 'Their donation was above and beyond.

'I want to go and visit them, show them pictures of the dogs, talk about my experiences with them, and thank them.'

Bags of fur: The matted and filthy hair which was shaved from the dogs was enough to fill three large sacks

After the dogs were found, vet Martha Edwards said the puppies' mother Sian had to be sedated while her fur was cut off, adding: ‘She had stones trapped between her paw pads which had obviously been there for some time. 

'It is disgusting. I have never seen a dog in this condition before.’ 

An animal welfare expert said it was likely the nine dogs had been kept in ‘unlivable’ conditions for their whole lives before being ditched ‘with no concern for their welfare’.
