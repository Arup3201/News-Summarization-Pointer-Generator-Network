Charged: Former police officer George Gibson has been arrested for starting a sexual relationship with an 8-year-old girl he was raising and fathering three children with her

A former police officer has been arrested for starting a sexual relationship with an eight-year-old girl he was raising and fathering three children with her.

George Gibson, from Newark, Ohio, allegedly knew the youngster because he had been dating her mother.

But she abandoned her child when the youngster was just eight years old and left her for Gibson to raise.

It is alleged he then started to have a sexual relationship with her in August 1993 - while working as a Hebron and Union Township police officer - which lasted for ten years.

According to 10TV, the pair now have three children, a 10-year-old, 7-year-old and 19-months.

It is believed that nobody was aware of the children Gibson had fathered.

Police officers were first alerted to the case in May 2011 following a child support enforcement hearing when officials realised the girl was just 15 when her first child was conceived.

Gibson and his alleged victim had applied for custody of their children.

Following an investigation which lasted for a year, the 43-year-old was arrested on Friday.

He was charged with two counts of corruption of a minor,Â  one count of rape, one count of gross sexual imposition, five counts of sexual battery and one count of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor.
