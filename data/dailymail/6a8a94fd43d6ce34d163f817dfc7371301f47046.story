The husband and father of two victims killed in a deadly June drunk driving accident isn't happy with the light probation sentence handed down to the 16-year-old behind the wheel.

Ethan Couch of Keller, Texas faced 20 years in prison for killing four and seriously injuring two other but got off with just 10 years probation when the judge bought the defense that he suffered from 'affluenza'. They argued that his wealthy upbringing kept him from understanding the link between behavior and consequence.

Eric Boyles, who lost his wife Hollie and 21-year-old daughter Shelby in the accident,  spoke with Fox's Martha MacCallum yesterday, saying he is dissatisfied with the easy sentence, and thinks Couch should have been tried as an adult.

Speaking out: Eric Boyles, the father and husband of two women killed in a June drunk driving accident, isn't pleased that the teen driver got off with just a 10 year probation sentence

No jail: Ethan Couch of Keller, Texas, pictured left on Tuesday, had faced 20 years behind bars but walked away with 10 years probation, something that has angering his victim's families

Since he was tried as a juvenile, Couch faced a maximum of 20 years in prison but would have been eligible for parole after 2 years.

'You look at 180 years of future life taken from the four individuals...Even a two year deal, a two year sentence before he's eligible for parole, didn't seem exactly fair under those circumstances,' Mr Boyle said.

Additionally upsetting to Mr Boyle is the fact that Couch will receive his counseling at a 'country club'-style treatment center in ritzy Newport Beach, California.

Mr Boyle was more emotional on Tuesday, the day the sentence was handed down.

'Money always seems to keep (Couch) out of trouble,' he told the Star Telegram. 'Ultimately today, I felt that money did prevail. If (he) had been any other youth, I feel like the circumstances would have been different.'

At around 11:45om on June 15, Couch and a group his friends who were all drunk, got into a red Ford F350 pick-up and were speeding 70 mph in a 40 mph zone when the truck left the road.

Drunk: Couch's blood alcohol reading was .24 and he also had a Valium in his system when he killed four people and injured several more on June 15

Mad: Victim Breanna Mitchell's mother Marla Mitchell, said she was 'mad' about the sentence and embraced Alex Lumas, whose brother was paralyzed in the accident outside of court

As it careered out of control, it clipped a broken down SUV, throwing the owner and four good Samaritans, who were trying to help, 60 yards in the air. Youth pastor Brian Jennings, mother and daughter Hollie and Shelby Boyles and 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell were all killed on impact.

It was revealed soon after that Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - three times the adult limit, though minors aren't allowed any alcohol in their system - and that he was also on the perscription drug Valium when the started the chain reaction of crashes.

The impact flung the four people 50 to 60 yards, authorities reported.

Jennings, a Burleson youth minister, had stopped to help Mitchell, whose vehicle had a flat tire, and Boyles and her daughter had come out of their nearby house to assist. The SUV and all four victims were standing off the roadway.

The red pickup then hit Mr Jennings' parked Silverado pickup with two boys inside.

Couch's red pickup flew up into the air, flipped and crashed into a tree.

None of the teens in the red truck were wearing seat belts, investigators said.

They had earlier stolen a couple of cases of beer from a Walmart in Burleson about an hour before the crash and prior to that, they had tried unsuccessfully to buy alcohol at a convenience store.

Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash

Killed: Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by Couch's out-of-control pickup

A psychologist called by the defense, Dr Gary Miller, blamed the teen's behavior on his parents, claiming they gave him whatever he wanted including 'freedoms no young person should have'.

Dr Miller called Couch a product of 'affluenza,' where his family felt their wealth bought privilege and there was no rational link between behavior and consequences. He added that the boy had an 'intellectual age' of 18 but an 'emotional age' of 12.

'The teen never learned to say that you’re sorry if you hurt someone,' Dr Miller said, according to the Star Telegram. 'If you hurt someone, you sent him money.'

State District Judge Jean Boyd appeared to agree with the defense.

She told the teen that he is responsible for what happened, but she said she didn't believe he would receive the therapy he needed in jail. If he violates the terms of his probation, he could be sent to prison for 10 years.

Defense attorneys asked that he be sent to a private rehabilitation home near Newport Beach, California, which costs an enormous $450,000 a year. His father said he'd foot the bill.

Killed: Brian Jennings, 41, was parked on the side of the road when Ethan Couch's pickup truck drove into him and three others

Scene: 911 callers described cars everywhere and kids' lying in ditches' after the June 15 smash

Injured: Sergio Molina remains in a coma whilst Soliman Mohmand, right, was seriously injured. They were both riding in Couch's truck when the cash occured

Prosecutors said the juvenile justice system also offered counseling.

Breanna's mother, Marla Mitchell, said she was 'mad' about the sentence and embraced the families of the other victims outside of the courtroom.

'He'll be feeling the hand of God, definitely,' she told WFAA.com. 'He may think he got away with something, but he hasn't gotten away with anything.'

Alex Lumas, whose brother was paralyzed in the accident, was also in disbelief at the probation.

'To me, it's not right,' he said.

However, the widow of one of the victims looked at the defendant in the courtroom and said, 'Ethan, we forgive you,' which caused Couch to swallowed hard and tear up a bit.

Couch's family did not comment on the sentence and the teen wasn't allowed to go home with his parents. He will remain at a detention center until Boyd decides whether he can go to the plush California facility.

Tragic: Jennings, pictured second from left, was a father of three and a youth minister in Burleson

Crash: One of four vehicles involved in the crash was sent flying into a tree

Soliman Mohmand and Sergio Molina were seriously injured and remains in a coma with a traumatic brain injury.

His medical bills have exceeded $600,000 and could climb into the millions if Mr Molina needs permanent round-the-clock care. His parents are now suing Couch and his family for up to $20 million in a separate lawsuit.

The Silverado was pushed into a Volkswagen Beetle, which was being driven by Ashlyn Evans, 18.

She and her 14-year-old passenger were also injured.

June's car crash wasn't the first time underage drinking had got Couch in trouble.

In February of this year, in the town Lakeside, northwest of Fort Worth, police found Couch with a 12-ounce can of beer and a 1.75-liter bottle of vodka in the early hours and gave him two citations - one for being a minor in possession of alcohol, the other for consuming alcohol as a minor.
