A 37-year-old woman who allegedly kept skeleton parts in her flat so she could have sex with them said while she is an 'odd duck' she has not committed a crime.

The Swedish woman was charged with violating the peace of the deceased after she was accused of using 100 parts, including six skulls and one backbone, in 'sexual situations'.

She told the Goeteborgsposten newspaper she did not use the human toys for sexual gratification but that she just had an interest in skeletons.

Six skulls and a backbone were among the body parts found

However she admitted she had an interest in necrophilia but denied a sexual interest.

She said: 'I know that it's strange and sounds bizarre, but skeletons are my hobby.

'I have an interest in forensic medicine and I'm passionate about osteology. I have pictures of dead people. I don't deny that.'

The woman was arrested in September when police were called to her apartment after gunfire was heard.

They found several human skeletons and knives and Swedish police later released pictures taken at her apartment of a human skull in a bed, skulls in carrier bags and her freezer.

It made headlines across the world and the woman believes she has been the victim of a miscarriage of justice.

She told the newspaper: 'More people have seen my face than a Batman movie.'

The woman, from south-western Sweden, also spoke of problems with drug and alcohol addiction.

She claims she acquired the skeletons for study and said she has analysed how the people died.

The trial ended two weeks ago and Gothernburg District Court is scheduled to give its ruling today.
