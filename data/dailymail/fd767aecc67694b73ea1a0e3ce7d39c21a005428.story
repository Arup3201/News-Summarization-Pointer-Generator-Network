New Orleans police say they're investigating the death of a man found with his neck lodged between two posts of an iron fence that wraps around around a shopping center.

Police say the man was found Thursday morning. 

The fence is about chest-high with bluntly pointed iron posts a few inches apart.

Officer Garry Flot says the man was a 58-year-old local and was pronounced dead at the scene. 

Scene: While initial reports said the 58-year-old local man was impaled, local media say his head was found caught in the fence by the neck outside the shopping center at Carrollton and Tulane in New Orleans

He says the coroner will determine the cause of death.

The death is currently listed as 'unclassified'. 

Flot says a woman walking by saw the body about 7 am and called police.

The Times-Picayune reports that police put a red tarp over the spot to shield the body from view.

According to WWL.com, initial reports that the man had been impaled were inaccurate.

It appears the man somehow got his head stuck. 

The investigation continues.
