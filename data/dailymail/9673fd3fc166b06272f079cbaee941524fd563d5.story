Adolf Hitler's half-brother Alois lived in a terrace house in Liverpool before the First World War, newly-uncovered documents suggest - but the home was later flattened by a German Luftwaffe bomb.

A copy of the 1911 census shows an 'Anton Hitler' - widely believed to the dictator's older half-sibling - and his wife Bridget, who was known as Cissie, were residents of the city.

Ironically, considering his infamous half-brother's Nazi policies, Alois lists his job as a 'chef waiter' in a Lyons cafe - which was a Jewish company.

Alois Hitler, the half-brother of Nazi leader Adolf, and his wife, Bridget (pictured in later life), are believed to have lived in Liverpool before the First World War

An 'Anton Hitler' (number 4 on list), believed to be Alois, and his wife 'Cissie Hitler' (number 6) are recorded as living in Upper Stanhope Street in the city

Hitler was said to have had a strained relationship with his half-brother, although there are reports that he may have visited Alois in Liverpool before the First World War

The property they were living in, at Upper Stanhope Street, was later destroyed during a German air raid on Liverpool in 1942 and to this day is still wasteland.

The fascinating document, uncovered by genealogy website findmypast.co.uk, shows the couple and their son William living in the property just years before the outbreak of the First World War.

The different styles of writing on the sheet suggest that each family member filled in their own details - with Alois even mistakenly writing in German in one entry - recording his son, William, as his 'sohn'.

For an unknown reason, he lists himself as being called 'Anton', rather than his full name, Alois, but it is thought that may have been a moniker he was using at the time.

Irish-born Bridget has also used a different name on the document, Cissie Hitler, but the first recording of her name is crossed out on the form and her family name 'Cissie Dowling' is still clearly visible.

Having been married less than a year, it seems Bridget was still adjusting to her new married name.Alois Hitler Jr had a troubled childhood and is said to have had a rocky relationship with his parents.

His mother died when he was two and his father married Klara Polzi - Adolf's mother.

It is thought Alois had a poor relationship with his younger half-brother and he is not mentioned in Hitler's book Mein Kampf.

In 1910, 
he met a young woman called Bridget Elizabeth Dowling, at the Dublin 
horse show in Ireland. Alois and Bridget eloped to London and married in
 June 1910.

In 1914, he returned to Germany without his family and married another woman - he was later prosecuted for bigamy.

It is believed he was arrested by the British at the end of the Second World War, but was released after it emerged he had not joined the Nazi party.

He reportedly later made money from selling autographed photos of his step-brother before his death in Hamburg, Germany in 1956.

His son William later visited Germany but fled to the US ahead of the Second World War and, after writing a magazine article called 'Why I Hate My Uncle', he took the name William Stuart-Houston and died in New York in 1987.

It is said William later had four sons, three of whom are still believed to be alive and are reportedly living in Long Island, near New York.

As well as half-brother, Alois, Adolf Hitler had a half-sister, Angela, and was one of six children born to his father Alois Sr and his wife Klara.

He had two older brothers, Gustav and Otto, an older sister, Ida, and two younger siblings, Edmund and Paula.

In a book called The Hitlers of Liverpool, author Mike Unger claims the future Fuhrer fled to Merseyside from Vienna, to avoid national service in 1912 and stayed in a flat in Toxteth with his married half-brother Alois.

Based on the memoirs of Bridget Hitler, the book claims Alois was a chronic gambler and, after one win, sent his sister Angela some money so she and her husband could visit from Vienna.

But Adolf took the money and traveled over instead â€“ to his half-brother's apparent fury, the book claims.

His arrival in Liverpool prompted Alois to suspect his half-brother was trying to dodge conscription into the Austrian army.

Bridget's book claims Alois told her: 'Adolf has been hiding from the military authorities, consequently from the police, for the last 18 months. That's why he came here to me. He had no choice.'

Bridget apparently wrote that in his five months at their Toxteth home, Hitler was a lazy guest who spent much of his time walking the streets and drinking in the nearby Poste House pub (pictured).

She wrote: 'Adolf took everything we did for granted and I'm sure would have remained indefinitely if he had had the slightest encouragement. After the first few weeks he would often come and sit in my cosy little kitchen playing with my two-year-old baby, while I was preparing our meals.

'He said he was looking for a job, but since he knew only a few words of English and never left early in the morning, it was always my opinion that he just wandered about Liverpool.'

Relations between the two brothers became more strained during the stay and, it is claimed, Alois bought his half-brother a ticket back to Germany, where he was sent to fight in the First World War before embarking on his infamous rise to political power.
