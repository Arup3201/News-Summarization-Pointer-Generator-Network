Vladimir Putin is said to be in bed 'with a cold', according to sources close to the Kremlin responding to speculation over why the leader has not been seen in public for ten days. 

Too ill to take part in official engagements, the politician is apparently holed up in one of his country retreats during one of the most contentious times in his leadership. 

Speculation over why he has seldom been seen in public has been rife as accusations of  involvement in the death of Boris Nemtsov and rumours of fathering a lovechild reach fever pitch. 

There have even been claims of sudden death and a government coup with the leader's aides remaining tight-lipped over his absence.

Vladimir Putin has not been seen in public for ten days because he is 'in bed with a cold', say sources close to the Russian politician 

But sources close to the Kremlin now say the reason for Putin's disappearance is a nasty cold which has left him bed bound. 

Opposition television station Dozhd quoted sources close to the leader as saying this was why he had been hidden from view. 

Despite his apparent illness, the leader will tune in to state television tonight to watch a pre-recorded documentary on the battle for Crimea. 

In it he makes the startling admission that Russia was prepared to put its nuclear weapons on alert to secure the peninsula. 

Wearing a stony expression, he tells the camera: 'We were ready to do it,' when asked whether he would have put nuclear weapons on alert. 

'I talked with colleagues and told them that this is our historic territory. 

'Russian people live there, they are in danger and we cannot leave them,' he continued, claiming a bout of flu caused him to remain hidden from public view for almost two weeks. 

His vanishing act comes after the murder of opponent Boris Nemtsov 

He also claims to have had intelligence which indicated anti-Russia militants planned to kill ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.  

'His physical removal was being prepared,' said Putin who has previously blamed the West for orchestrating the toppling of the pro-Moscow leader.

'It was not us who carried out the coup,' he insisted. 

He also suggested that Yanukovych could have saved himself from a coup if he had used weapons on protesters.

'I do not want to evaluate his work.... (but) he said "I could not sign an order on use of weaponry. I could not bring myself to do it."

'Can we blame him for it? I cannot say. And I do not want to do it. I don't think I have a right to do so.

'Whether it is good or bad, the consequences of inactivity are grave. This is clear.'

The interview comes amid rumours that the president has fathered a child with 'lover' Alina Kabayeva. 

The 31-year-old former mistress is said to have given birth in Switzerland in recent days. 

While sources said the leader was unwell, his official press secretary Dmirty Peskov refused to confirm the claims, saying: 'No comment, the topic is closed.' 

Putin is due in St Petersburg on Monday to meet Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev, although in one of many bizarre episodes in recent days footage of the supposed summit was aired last week by a TV channel. 

One former loyalist said yesterday that Putin could face the same fate as the last Tsar of Russia, shot by a Bolshevik firing squad, or ex-Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, who died in The Hague awaiting trial.

Igor Strelkov - a key military commander of rebel fighters in Crimea and eastern Ukraine - also noted that 15 March was the date of the abdication of monarch Nicholas II, 98 years ago.

One report citing military historian Strelkov said 'that Vladimir Putin might follow the destiny of Emperor Nicholas II, who was shot in 1918.

'Another path for Putin, according to Strelkov is a repetition of final days of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, who died in 2006 in jail in The Hague.'

Rumours the Russian President has fathered a child with gymnast Alina Kabayeva (above) are also rife 

The Russian leader said he was prepared to put nuclear weapons on alert during the battle for Crimea which sparked widespread riots across Ukraine (above)
