Solicitor Tevfick Souleiman has been jailed for ten years for his involvment in Britain's biggest sham marriage racket which let up to 2,000 illegal immigrants stay in the country

A lawyer and three accomplices were jailed yesterday for arranging 2,000 sham marriages that earnt them £20million.

Tevfick Souleiman and his gang flew women into Britain from EU countries in the former Soviet bloc to marry citizens from outside the EU.

Most couples met on the day of the wedding and needed an interpreter to get through their marriage vows.

Some of the grooms were dangerous career criminals from Albania suspected of murder, drugs trafficking and money laundering. But they won a right to live in the UK because of their EU ‘wives’.

The scam, thought to be Britain’s biggest marriage racket, ran on an ‘industrial scale’ for eight years.

Jailing the gang for a combined 35 years, Judge John Bevan QC said their enterprise had been ‘an attack on the institution of marriage’ that drove ‘a coach and horses through the immigration rules’.

He told them: ‘A heavy responsibility for upholding the rule of law rests with lawyers. If the public cannot trust the integrity of lawyers, who can they trust?’

Souleiman, 39, was jailed for ten years, while his immigration adviser colleagues Cenk Guclu, 41, and Furrah Kosimov, 29, received nine-year prison terms. Zafer Altinbas, 38, was jailed for six years and nine months.

The Old Bailey judge added: ‘There must, as a result of this case, be scores of people in this country, many of whom will be imposing a wholly undeserved burden on the hard-pressed taxpayer.

‘It represents an attack on the institution of marriage itself, treating it as a paper exercise involving two people who cannot understand a word the other is saying and meeting, for all intents and purposes, on their wedding day.’

Cenk Guclu, right, tried to blame workmate Furrah Kosimov for the crime but was found to be part of the racket that created 'sham marriages' in order to obtain British passports along with Zafer Altinbas, left

Criminals would pay Souleiman GA, a 
law firm based in North London, around £14,000 to arrange marriages with
Eastern European women.

The firm created ‘touching love stories’ to make the marriages with men from Albania, Russia, Pakistan and India appear genuine.

Brides were flown in each day on 
budget airlines and then housed in a grim tower block before being taken
to register offices across the country.

Following the marriages the women 
would be paid a fee for their time and ordered never to contact their 
‘husbands’ again. Most would return to their home countries immediately.

Last night a source told the Mail that the scam had allowed ‘dangerous criminals to operate freely’ in Britain.

‘We believe this to be the largest marriage fraud ever committed in the UK,’ the source said.

‘Some of them are wanted for serious crimes in Albania. Others are suspects in murder investigations in this country.

‘These are the type of people who are being allowed to stay in the UK.

I fear this type of crime will only 
get more prevalent when Romanians and Bulgarians are allowed to freely 
live here from next year.’

The defendants, three Turkish Cypriots and one from Uzbekistan, used the money to fund luxurious lifestyles.

They bought a selection of properties in London and North Cyprus and rewarded themselves with luxury cars.

When London marriage officials grew 
suspicious about the number of weddings the firm was involved with, the 
gang simply switched to other parts of the country.

Marriage applications were made to 
appear genuine by enclosing fake documents including business accounts, 
tenancy agreements and references.

Forged affidavits containing details of the couples’ supposed courtships were also included.

In one dossier, Alban Spaho from 
Albania described how he met his bride-to-be Petya Zlatanska while on a 
day out with friends in 2008.

The affidavit said: ‘We went to a cafe where our friends left us alone to get on with it.

‘Petya was a bit shy but I eventually
persuaded her to let me take her out. After three months I realised I 
wanted to be with her all the time and asked her to marry me.’

Another client pretended he met his bride in a nightclub and proposed following a romantic Valentine’s Day meal.

Nicholas Mather, prosecuting, said: ‘The arrangement of these marriages was a lucrative business.

‘Substantial sums were being paid to individuals to arrange these marriages. This was a cash business.’

The racket was uncovered after British police cracked an Albanian drugs and money laundering ring in London.

Brothers Behar and Elton Dika had 
planned to flood Britain with £900million of cocaine, but the ship 
carrying the drugs was raided off the coast of Spain in 2009.

They were jailed and investigations showed their marriages had been arranged by the law firm.
