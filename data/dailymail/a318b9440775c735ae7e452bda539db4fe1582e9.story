You might be forgiven for thinking that this is a beach hut that’s being rescued after being washed out to sea.

But it’s actually a luxurious hut worth £40,000 that’s being towed on the water to an exclusive sandy spit because it was too big to be driven there.

The timber chalet, that measures 13ft by 13ft, was transported using the unconventional method to Mudeford Spit, Dorset, which is home to Britain’s most expensive beach huts.

Wood you believe it? The timber chalet, that measures 13ft by 13ft, was transported using the unconventional method to Mudeford Spit

Well appointed: The hut has a lounge area, dining table, surround sound system, outlets to plug in electrical equipment, and the fixture for a TV to be installed

The remote sandbank, where huts sell for around £150,000, can only be accessed by boat or along a narrow road that is also used by a novelty land train.

The owners of the new hut had to pay for it to be lifted onto the back of a small barge and towed down the River Stour, across Christchurch Harbour to Mudeford.

Once the hut arrived on the peninsula it was lowered into place by a crane and is now nestled between two others.

Exclusive: The beach hut is one of 350 at Mudeford which are the most expensive in the country

Stuff of dreams: The hut can sleep up to six people on a double and two single beds on a mezzanine level in the loft space

The luxury structure, made from cedar wood, was built off-site and has a kitchen area that comes with full-size fridge-freezer, a four ring hob, gas oven and a sink.

It has a lounge area, dining table, surround sound system, outlets to plug in electrical equipment, and the fixture for a TV to be installed.

There is no mains electricity or water but it does have two solar panels that power a 12 volt battery, providing power and hot water using a pump.

It can sleep up to six people on a double and two single beds on a mezzanine level in the loft space and two on sofa-beds in the lounge but a local bylaw restricts overnight stays there from Easter through to Autumn.

A communal shower block on the sandbank provides the owners with toilet and washing facilities.

The hut has been constructed by Ecologic Developments for an unnamed couple in their 40s who have two young children.

Pricey: Some of the huts at Mudeford Spit sell for around £150,000 on average because of the stunning views of the Solent

Peter Samson, 34, owner of Ecologic Developments, said: ‘This beach hut is bigger than the standard, which usually measure 10ft by 15ft.

‘Because of the size it was too big to take on the narrow road so we decided to float it over by boat, it was the first time we have done this and it went really well.

‘This hut was built to replace one that was on the plot previously because the owners wanted to update it.

‘It is fully fitted internally and all that is left to do is put in the soft furnishings.

‘It has a 12 volt electricity system running from solar panels which charge up batteries, from that you can run things such as a refrigerator and water heating.

‘It also has a water pump, surround sound system, sockets to charge electrical items and the fixture for a TV. The owners are delighted.’

This beach hut is one of 350 at Mudeford, which are the most expensive in the country.

They sell for around £150,000 on average because of the stunning views of the Solent.

One of Mudeford Spit's huts was put on the market for £180,000 last summer and sold within days.

Meanwhile, Chalet number 4, on Beach Road, in
 West Bexington, Dorset, became one of the world's most expensive beach 
huts when it sold for £235,000 in 2006

The felt-roof hut had a sitting 
room measuring 2.85m by 2.59m, a kitchen which was 1.3m by 4.11m, a 
toilet and one bedroom measuring 2.87m x 2.62m.

It had running water, drainage and 
mains electricity, a garden, the potential for off-site parking and can 
be lived in all year round.

The new owner won a heated five-way auction held in Sherborne, Dorset, to snap up the hut.
