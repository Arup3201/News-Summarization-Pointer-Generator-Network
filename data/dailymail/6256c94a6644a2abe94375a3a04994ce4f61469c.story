People who call gay sex ‘disgusting’ will be allowed to stay in the UK Independence Party.

Nigel Farage defended party members with ‘old-fashioned’ views about homosexuality, as he warned that with the government passing same-sex weddings ‘nobody knows where it will end up’.

MPs last night backed the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, but Mr Farage said ministers were ‘picking a war with middle England’.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage accused the government of picking a fight with Middle Britain

Mr Farage was challenged over reports of that a UKIP online forum was used by a party candidates to allegedly brand gay sex ‘disgusting’ and said that homosexuals were not ‘normal’.

The UKIP leader conceded that racist comments allegedly made were ‘over the top’ and would be discussed by the party's national executive in two weeks' time.

But he held back from criticising remarks allegedly made by another council candidate, who was reported by the Sunday Mirror to have used an online forum to say that gay sex was ‘disgusting’.

The candidate added that ‘what irritates me is the way they and their leftie, neo-Commie followers seem to want to force the rest of us to consider them as normal’.

Mr Farage told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show: ‘That is an old-fashioned view that you would hear in private bridge clubs and golf clubs and probably British Legion clubs up and down the length and breadth of the country.

‘If you are suggesting that we should become so politically correct that we should kick out anyone who holds a slightly old-fashioned view, frankly that would be the death of debate in politics in Britain.’

Mr Farage said that his fellow-UKIP MEP Roger Helmer had gone ‘too far’ by drawing a link between gay marriage and incest.

But he added: ‘The point he was making is if we change the definition of marriage, nobody knows where it will end up.

‘We are about to redefine marriage - something that has been a fundamental staple of our society for very many centuries.

'The 1950s world where homosexuals could be sent to prison has ended.

‘We now have civil partnerships. What the Government is now doing is picking a war with middle England on something that wasn't in their manifesto and frankly there isn't much demand for.’

However, Prime Minister David Cameron today issued a staunch defence of the policy, arguing young gay boys at school could ‘stand a little taller’ knowing that Parliament has given them equality.

Mr Cameron admitted gay marriage has been deeply unpopular within Tory ranks, but insisted it was the right thing to do.

In a passionate a deeply personal defence of same sex weddings, Mr Cameron said: 'I think marriage is a wonderful institution, it helps people to commit to each other. I think it’s such a good institution it should be available to gay people as well as heterosexuals.

'There will be young boys in schools today, who are gay, who are worried about being bullied, who are worried about what society thinks of them, who can see that the highest Parliament in the land has said that their love is the same as everyone else’s love, and that we believe in equality.

'I think they’ll stand that bit taller today, and I’m proud of the fact that has happened.'

He said the Tory party was a 'broad church' of opinion but being in government meant taking tough choices. 'When you make decisions sometimes you make opponents and enemies.'

'Of course the gay marriage issue has been divisive and I totally respect those who take a different opinion.

'I don’t think in any way that to oppose gay marriage to be wrong-headed or bigoted. This is a different point of view but we should respect each other,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
