Members of the Royal family were out in force this morning to show their support to the Queen's granddaughter, Zara Phillips, who made her Olympic equestrian debut. 

Phillips' grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, as well as her mother, Princess Anne, were in the VIP seats at Greenwich Park as Phillips competed in the eventing dressage competition.

She scored a solid 48.10 penalty points, despite a mistake toward the beginning of her canter in the first 'flying change.'

In the stride, the horse is supposed to 
change the sequence of his steps from side to side, but High Kingdom 
didn't respond immediately to Phillips' cues.

Cheers and applause broke out as she rode into the stadium and erupted anew when she finished.

Phillips said it was an 'amazing feeling' to take part in the Olympics.

Crowds at the equestrian arena in 
Greenwich, south east London, cheered and waved union flags as the Royal 
put in a strong performance.

She said: 'It was incredible, an 
amazing feeling to be part of the Olympics and to ride for your country 
and to just be here. The crowd are amazing.

'It was incredible to be selected, 
and to be at here at home for the Olympics is an amazing feeling. You 
try to do your best for the team.'

Anne, wearing a bright red canvas hat to protect against the strong sun, applauded politely at the end.

Despite a small hiccup, Phillips said she was pleased with the performance.

'It was disappointing about his first
change, but his other ones were really good,' she said afterward. 'But 
he coped with all the crowd and is only getting better.'

Phillips, a former world and European
eventing champion, said the mistake had nothing to do with the 
enthusiasm from the stands - a rousing welcome that prompted the 
announcer to remind the audience to keep applause to a minimum until the
test was finished.

The 13th in line to the throne has 
never competed in an Olympics because of injuries to her former horse 
Toytown in 2004 and 2008.

But she is now one of the favourites for a medal as she tries to emulate her father Captain Mark Phillips, who won Olympic gold in 1972 and silver in 1988.

Phillips, who was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year after being crowned eventing world champion in 2006, will compete in the individual and team three-day eventing competitions.

The word 'dressage' is a French term meaning training. 

Horse and rider are expected to perform from memory a series of choreographed movements. 

It takes years of dedication and training to reach the Grand Prix level which is seen at the Olympics. 

The close relationship between horse and rider takes months, if not years, to form. 

Horse and rider are given a mark out of ten for each movement they perform plus additional marks for the horse's pace, impulsion, submission and the rider's position.

There were a number of empty seats in the arena today as Zara competed, but speaking yesterday, equestrian sport manager Tim Hadaway said crowds at the event move throughout the venue during the day, meaning some seats may be left empty at times.

He said: 'A lot of people are out and around the arena, sitting on the grass looking at the big screens. There is an opportunity for spectators to walk around the cross country course.

'That perhaps explains why seats are unfilled. It's a long day of dressage, people watch five or six tests and then they go and look around.'

The equestrian event is being held at Greenwich Park, which dates from 1433 and is the oldest royal park in London.

The main equestrian arena sits right in front of Queen's House, a 17th-century building designed as a summer palace for Queen Anne of Denmark, the wife of James I.

Horses are a big part of the royal family: the queen is an accomplished and enthusiastic equestrian and still rides often.

Princess Anne is not only president of the British Olympic committee but a member of the International Olympic Committee and a former equestrian eventing Olympian herself.

She competed in the 1976 Montreal Olympics but her horse fell going over a jump during the cross country event.

In the first day of the dressage competition Saturday, Australia took the early lead with Germany and the United States close behind.
