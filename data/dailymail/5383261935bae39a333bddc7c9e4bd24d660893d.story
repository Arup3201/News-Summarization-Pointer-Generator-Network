A motorist has escaped a horror crash after his car plunged 50ft down a cliff – and he and his passenger walked away unharmed.

Kris Newton, 34, was driving his father’s Subaru Impreza in Walker, Newcastle, with a friend at around 10am yesterday when he accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brakes.

The pair narrowly missed being impaled on equipment in a marine firm yard when the vehicle ploughed through a metal security fence and down a steep bank before landing on its side below.

Kris Newton accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brakes to avoid hitting a pigeon that flew out in front

Mr Newton, from North Shields, said: ‘I was coming down, just from under the bridge, when a pigeon or something flew in front of the car.

‘Instead of hitting the brake, I hit the accelerator and then I was just bouncing off the walls.

‘It just happened so fast, I didn't really know what was going on until we were at the bottom.’

Mr Newton added that he had been struggling to concentrate due to the death of a family member.

He said: ‘I've been driving since I was 25, and I've not had a serious crash.

‘We went through the fence and the next thing I knew I was down the bottom climbing out.

‘It all happened so quickly.

‘I've no idea what happened.’

An onlooker who witnessed the crash at Shepherd Offshore on Wincomblee Road said: ‘I saw the two lads getting out and scampering away.

‘The car was still smoking.

‘I was talking to one of the guys afterwards, there was some dirt on his arm where he had pulled himself out, but he didn't have a scratch on him.

‘I couldn't believe what I'd seen.’

A Northumbria Police spokesman said it was being treated as a damage only incident.
