L’Wren Scott grew up as plain Luann Bambrough in the one-horse town of Roy, Utah, where she was raised by her devout Mormon parents Lula and Ivan.

The couple adopted her as a baby and sibling to elder brother Randal and sister Jan. She frequently credited her mother and father for instilling her with a strong work ethic.

Ivan Bambrough served in the U.S. Navy during the Second World War before returning to settle in Roy, a quiet town of less than 40,000 residents.

He worked as an account executive for the insurance company Blue Cross and Blue Shield for 35 years until his death in 2002 at the age of 76. 

Mr Bambrough and wife Lula, a bank clerk who died in 2008, were active members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints making religion a large part of Luann's upbringing. Her father served as a High Priest and Bishop for the church.

The dark-haired beauty stood out in the small town after shooting up to 6ft by the age of 12. She eventually grew to 6ft 3in with 42 inch legs, raven hair and porcelain skin.

Her lofty stature at such a young age
 also helped sew the seeds for her success as a stylist and designer in 
later life. Talking to the Daily Telegraph, she said: 'I had to learn to sew when I was growing up, because nothing else fitted me.

‘I
 used to spend hours at the local store, leafing through big books of 
Vogue and Butterick patterns, and then order one of them, and wait for 
it to arrive, so that by the time it was delivered I was really 
excited.'

She also 
adjusted old dresses show found in local thrifts stores. She told the 
paper: ‘'I remember finding a black silk 1950s dress, taking it home and
 unpicking the waistband and the seams, then sewing it together again, 
so that it would fit me.'

Her glamor did not go unnoticed and after graduating high school in 1985 aged 17, a chance meeting led to her being spotted by celebrity photographer Bruce Weber.

On Weber’s advice she avoided going to New York where ‘they wouldn’t get her’ and bought a one-way plane ticket to Paris.

Despite knowing no one and not speaking the language, she paid the fare using her savings from babysitting jobs and launched herself on the European fashion scene. It was then that she changed her name to L’Wren Scott.

She reportedly had the longest legs 
that designers had ever seen which quickly landed a succession of 
high-profile modeling gigs for Chanel and Thierry Mugler.

Her
 42-inch legs were stars of an iconic Pretty Polly stockings ad shot by 
David Bailey. However she admitted: 'I wasn't good at being objectified.
 I was always a very behind-the scenes person.'

She dated wealthy, London-based property 
developer Andrew Ladsky, who is related to the Boucheron jewellery 
dynasty. But their three-year relationship ended acrimoniously in 1991 
in a row about the ownership of a sheepskin coat and two pictures.

In 1994, tiring of Paris, Scott reinvented herself again and moved to Los Angeles to head up PR for Prada.

It was then she began work as a celebrity stylist, working with celebrity photographer Herb Ritts. She soon became the go to dresser for stars including Nicole Kidman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Ellen Barkin and Julianne Moore. In 2000, she was the named the official stylist of the Oscars.

She married another property entrepreneur, Anthony Brand. But they divorced after just three years of marriage in 1996.

In 2001, she began dating Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger after meeting at a photo-shoot in Paris where she had been hired as a stylist.

They made for an unusual coupling, as she stood head and shoulders above his 5ft 8inch frame and was 23 years his junior. However they were together for 13 years, longer than Jagger's marriages to Bianca Jagger and Jerry Hall.

L'Wren's mother Lula told a newspaper in 2003: 'L'Wren is very independent and would not take any nonsense from anyone no matter how famous they were.

'She usually knows what she wants and she gets it. It doesn't surprise me at all that she's tamed Mick. She is very much her own woman and it would be my guess that is why this Mick Jagger likes her.'

Despite being a rock star’s girlfriend she was by no means a fawning groupie. In fact she once admitted, when asked about her love of Rolling Stones songs: 'I loved Motown, and blues, and classical music, but never rock 'n' roll.'

The late L'Wren Scott became an internationally recognized fashion designer and the girlfriend of Rolling Stones legend Mick Jagger. She is pictured as a young girl at her Utah home in 1977

In 2006, Scott finally decided to launch (with Jagger's help) her own line of clothing and has since launched many collections that have won the praise of the A-List.

Sarah Jessica Parker once said: 'I think L'Wren has an extraordinary ability to make dresses that genuinely flatter a woman. She makes an unbelievably contemporary dress in a remarkably old-fashioned way for all sorts of women and body types.'

She also designed lines for Barney’s in New York and Banana Republic. Her first handbag line she named Lula after her mother 'who always carried a bag with her to work every day'.

Though she based her showroom in Paris, Scott spent her time shuttling between the $10million  London home that Jagger had bought for them in 2007 and her $5.6million New York City apartment.

Scott made the surprise announcement last month that she was canceling her London Fashion Week show reportedly due to production delays with some key pieces in her collection.

She was found dead after an apparent suicide at her Chelsea apartment in New York City by her assistant on the morning of March 17.
