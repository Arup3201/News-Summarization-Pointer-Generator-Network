A police force has been accused of trivialising rape after it distributed a bizarre Christmas poem about the crime.

The verses – a version of ’Twas the Night Before Christmas adapted to tell the story of a woman being sexually attacked – were composed by Nottinghamshire Police as part of an awareness campaign.

But members of the public branded the poem, renamed The Nightmare Before Christmas, ‘disgusting’ and ‘insensitive’.

Critics have said Nottinghamshire Police's version of Twas The Night Before Christmas trivialises the horror of sex attacks

It features on a poster distributed at train stations across the county.

At first glance, the design appears to be aimed at children, with a cartoon drawing of a snow-covered cottage with smoke coming out of the chimney.

But women’s groups have called for it to be removed immediately, saying it is too explicit for children and that it belittles the horror of sex attacks.

Cathy Saunders, of the Nottingham branch of Women’s Aid, said last night: ‘It’s a disgrace and should be withdrawn immediately. I utterly condemn it.

‘I have spoken to some of our clients who have been victims of sexual assault and they have been utterly distressed and shocked by this poem.

‘They feel that the re-working of a poem aimed at children trivialises the worst event in their lives … Children familiar with the proper Christmas poem would be left very confused if they came across this police version.’She added that the force should concentrate on a ‘stark, unambiguous message that rape is wrong’.

One verse that has drawn particular criticism from campaigners reads: ‘Although she screamed “no” it happened in a flash / As soon as she could free herself she made a desperate dash.’

Earlier this week Nottinghamshire Police had to re-name an anti-crime poster campaign called Badvent after critics deemed it to be in poor taste

A spokesman for the group Sexual Abuse Survivors said the phrase ‘happened in a flash’ was not an accurate portrayal of a victim’s experience. She added: ‘That experience can feel like it goes on forever and even after the attack it will stay with that person for a very long time almost like a recording in their mind that goes over and over again.’

But Nottinghamshire Police denied the poem was offensive and said the poster aimed to make would-be rapists more aware of  the catastrophic harm sex attacks have on women.

Despite admitting it had ‘caused a stir’ and holding a meeting yesterday to discuss the complaints, the force decided not to remove the poem from its website.

Nottinghamshire Police yesterday insisted they had consulted two unnamed women’s groups before the poster was distributed.

Superintendent
Helen Chamberlain apologised to anyone who had been offended by the 
‘re-working’ of the poem – traditionally read to children on Christmas 
Eve.

But she added: 
‘Issuing safety messages for people who are out enjoying Christmas 
festivities is a valuable way of helping to protect, in the main, women 
and girls from sexual attacks.

‘However,
sometimes, constantly reiterating these messages can make women feel 
that they are at fault if they are attacked … We want women to know that
if they are raped or sexually assaulted, they are not to blame.

‘Our message to men is that it’s not 
acceptable to take advantage of a woman because she has had a drink or 
is being sociable. And women shouldn’t have to tolerate or be forced to 
guard themselves from predatory behaviour.’

But Jo Costello, of campaign group Ending Victimisation, said last night that the police force had ‘failed spectacularly’.

‘Many
women tell us that they didn’t want to report to the police for a 
variety of reasons, predominantly the fear of being blamed for their own
sexual assault,’ she said. ‘Police campaigns such as this add to the 
commonly-held view that women can somehow prevent rape.’

Earlier
this week Nottinghamshire Police was forced to rename an anti-crime 
poster it had called a ‘Badvent calendar’ after critics complained it 
was in poor taste.
