Doctors are planning to separate five-month-old twin girls who were born joined at the chest.

Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata weighed just 3 pounds, 7 ounces each when they were delivered by Cesarean section at Texas Children's Pavilion for Women at 31 weeks on April 11.

The sisters have now grown to 11 pounds each and doctors are considering what's next for the girls, who share a liver, diaphragm, heart lining and intestines.

Dr. Stephen Welty, chief of neonatology at Texas Children's Fetal Center, told the Houston Chronicle that the twins will likely be separated when they are eight months old. 

Loved: Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata were born in April and doctors hope they will undergo surgery in a couple of months. Their mother, Elysse Mata, is pictured kissing them in a Houston hospital

Growing: They weighed three pounds, seven ounces each when they were born but are now 11 pounds each

Overjoyed: Mrs Mata looks down at her baby girls, who she said are fast developing their own personalities

'We can make no guarantees,' Welty said. 'We expect it to be technically hard, but that the outcome will be good.'

Welty previously said the twins would need respiratory support but 'we don't expect them to have any serious setbacks'. 

Doctors said the goal for now is for the babies to continue to grow and gain weight.

On the family's YouCaring page, they explained that doctors will use tissue expanders to stretch the girls' skin in preparation for the surgery. It will take up to two months for the skin to stretch enough to cover the area after they are separated.

After the separation, the girls will undergo rehabilitation to learn how to balance, crawl and walk. 

Their parents, Elysse and John Mata from Lubbock, who have an older son, five-year-old Azariah, found out that they were having conjoined twins during an ultrasound in January. 

Healthy: Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata will be separated when they are about eight months old

Gorgeous: The girls were born at 31 weeks in April and are going from strength to strength, their family said

Proud: Their parents and big brother said the girls - who are joined at the chest, right, and share a liver, diaphragm, intestines and heart lining - are developing their own personalities

'I was speechless, it was so unexpected,' Mrs Mata told ABC.

On their YouCaring page, the family added: 'Their chances of survival were a mere 20 per cent which inspired their middle names, Faith and Hope.'

The family moved from Lubbock to be closer to the hospital in Houston, with Mr Mata's job transferring him and helping set his family up with a home and other items. 

They say they have enjoyed watching their happy girls grow and develop distinct personalities - with Knatalye being far feistier, while her sister is more laid back.

'They love to hear people talk, and they love new people,' Mrs Mata said.

Conjoined twins make up one in every 200,000 live births and approximately 40 to 60 per cent are stillborn, while around 35 per cent survive just one day.
