Union pressure: Labour leader Ed Milliband

Education Secretary Michael Gove has accused Ed Miliband of threatening to impose a £40 million ‘Militax’ on voters by forcing them to pick up the bill for running Britain’s political parties.

In an outspoken attack, Mr Gove says Mr Miliband’s recent call for a ban on political donations of more than £5,000 from individuals would inevitably lead to state funding  for the Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems.

And he argues Mr Miliband’s proposal is primarily designed to deflect attention from the row over the way that Labour is bankrolled by unions such as Len McCluskey’s Unite.

Mr Gove, increasingly seen as a possible successor to David Cameron as Tory leader, claims  Mr Miliband is trying to revive plans by the last Labour Government to introduce state funding of political parties.

‘There are few dirtier monetary transactions than politicians agreeing to pick the pockets of people poorer than themselves to fund activities which should be supported voluntarily,’ writes Mr Gove in today’s Mail on Sunday.

‘That is the position Labour is  now embracing – call it what you will, a spin tax, a “Militax”, a “going to the poll” tax – it’s all the same thing... more taxes to pay for  more politicians spending more of your money.

‘Hard-working people pay enough tax...But if Ed Miliband gets his way you will be forced to pay  for him.’

Tory sources say the £40 million ‘Militax’ is based on the 2011 Kelly review of party funding which said a £10,000 cap could lead to a shortfall of more than £20 million a year.

They say that would double under Mr Miliband’s £5,000 cap.

In a keynote speech on Tuesday, Mr Gove plans to make a wider attack on Labour’s links to the unions. But he will deny the Conservatives are anti-union and recall his own experience as a striker.

The Education Secretary, who has denounced ‘bigotry’ in teaching unions for holding back children  by staging industrial action, walked out while working on a regional newspaper in 1989.

He claimed that he ‘didn’t agree’ with the walkout but as a cub reporter and new union member he felt duty bound to join the picket line.

Mr Miliband says the £5,000  cap is vital to stop rich Tory supporters making donations of tens  of thousands of pounds to gain  access and influence in the Conservative Party.

Mr Gove’s ‘Militax’ jibe will be seen as an attempt to counter  damaging Labour attacks on the Tories over the so-called ‘bedroom tax’ and other controversial levies dubbed the ‘granny tax’ and the ‘pasty tax’.

Mr Cameron has suggested a £50,000 cap on donations.

A Labour official said: ‘The Tories have plucked the figure of £40  million from the air. The public is appalled by the way the rich can buy their way on to the top table of the Conservative Party.

‘Labour is taking steps to reform its relationship with the unions and the Tories should clean up their own backyard before criticising us.’
