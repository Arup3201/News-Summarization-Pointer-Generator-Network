A 1920s Massachusetts fieldstone mansion has been fully restored and can now be yours for $2.1million.

The Ashland stone exterior home was built in 1925 by railroad tycoon Homer Loring, President of the Boston & Maine railroad, according to information provided by realtor Pam Smeagle, of Mathieu Newton Sothebyâ€™s International Realty.

The property was formerly known as Waseeka Kennels, where Elizabeth Loring-Powers bred champion Newfoundland dogs. Her daughter Susan bred Morgan horses several years later on the property.

The home served as an assisted living facility before it was purchased by Arthur and Faith Schwartz in 2002 and restored.

The residence includes six bedrooms, as well as five full bathrooms and two partial bathrooms.
