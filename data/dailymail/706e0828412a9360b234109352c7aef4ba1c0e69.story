It happens almost every time an airline employee announces that a plane is ready for boarding – anxious passengers queue at the gate, only to face a torturous wait while the plane is loaded from back to front.

Making matters worse, some passengers try to jump the queue while those on board battle for space in the overhead storage locker.

For those who are convinced there is a faster and more efficient method, a test by the popular American television series MythBusters appears to back up that theory.

Hurry up and wait: American television series MythBusters investigated the fastest boarding methods

Doing it wrong: The episode revealed the best - and quickest - way to board a plane

The Discovery Channel series found that the boarding method used by most carriers – business class first and followed by zones from back to front – is the slowest and least efficient of six possible seating techniques.

Using a custom-built replica of a 173-seat aircraft interior, it took 24 minutes and 29 seconds before all of the volunteer passengers were in their seats with the back-to-front method. 

It turns out the fastest method involved no assigned seating. With a time of 14 minutes and seven seconds, business class boarded first and then all other passengers chose their seats at random as they stepped onto the aircraft.

Even though it was the fastest method, it had the worst passenger satisfaction rating.

The traditional back-to-front boarding method used by most airlines was the slowest and least efficient

The reverse pyramid method had the highest customer satisfaction rating. Passengers in economy boarded the plane from back to front and outside in. It was the third fastest technique with a time of 15 minutes and 10 seconds.

With a time of 14 minutes and 55 seconds, the Wilma method (window seats first, followed by middle seats and aisle seats) was the second fastest technique.

A combination of the Wilma method and zones – the fourth fastest scenario – filled the plane in 15 minutes and seven seconds, while the fifth fastest was a free-for-all with assigned seating (17 minutes and 15 seconds).

Professional cabin crew directed passengers to their seats and assisted with hand luggage that had to be placed in overhead lockers or checked because it was too large.

Five per cent of the volunteers were given tasks to slow down the process to simulate an actual boarding experience.

The tasks included sitting in the wrong seat, taking an excruciatingly long time to fold a coat or carrying a small child.
