Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen may both take the field on Friday evening in the latest round of NatWest T20 Blast matches. You can be sure both men will feature prominently in Saturday morning’s papers – more prominently, in fact, than the games in which they are scheduled to appear.

The frisson will say something about their cricketing charisma, and perhaps a little more about the general absence of that quality elsewhere in English cricket.

This is to take nothing away from Jos Buttler or Chris Jordan or even Ben Stokes; doubtless Steven Finn will rise again, and there is plenty of time for Eoin Morgan to become the bums-on-seats merchant of England’s middle order.

Getting ready to have a Blast: Andrew Flintoff is set to play for Lancashire against Yorkshire on Friday

But when the most attractive storylines of our domestic Twenty20 tournament concern a player who last appeared five years ago, and another who has been cast aside by England after falling out with one power-broker too many, then you are entitled to wonder about the robustness of the game as a whole.

A wider question arises here, and it sprung to mind almost as soon as Buttler reverse-swept Sachithra Senanayake for four at Lord’s on Saturday. It was not so much the chutzpah of the stroke that stood out, as its statistical shock value: it was England’s first boundary for almost 22 overs.

What preceded it seemed to sum up the malaise: faced with a target of 300, Gary Ballance and Joe Root – two highly promising players hailed as the present and the future – poked and prodded as if they were chasing 100 fewer.

There is a wilful conservatism about English cricket, and now it was exposed for an hour-and-a-half by bowlers who wouldn’t know a coaching manual if it screamed in their face about getting side on and keeping their arm straight.

Had Buttler taken England to victory, he would merely have provided the most glorious of glosses. What happened soon after confirmed that talk of a brave new era has to be seen for what it is.

In the post-match press conference, Alastair Cook suggested Buttler wasn’t ‘quite ready’ for Test cricket. Bewilderingly, Buttler himself agreed, adding: ‘That is my honest opinion and that is the opinion of others.’

Yet anyone who watched him flay Sri Lanka all over Lord’s may wonder when exactly he will be ready – and whether any other Test nation would so quickly dampen the enthusiasm surrounding a player who has lit up English cricket during some of its darkest days.

At least coach Peter Moores did his best to salvage the situation on Monday with some positive comments about Buttler’s chances of a Test debut.

But If England are worried about Buttler’s glovework, then they should remember how clumsy Matt Prior was at the start of his Test career. If they are worried about his batting technique, then they should stop regarding the glass as half-empty.

This inherent caution has obviously extended to Buttler’s own sense of self-worth. Thank goodness it hasn’t yet impaired his batting.

Making a racket: Kevin Pietersen is in line to play for Surrey on Friday

Last week this column argued for the inclusion of Alex Hales in the one-day team – but the public dilution of Buttler’s Test prospects feels even more jarring.

English cricket has rarely embraced unorthodoxy. Even Pietersen, its most recent claimant to the noun, learned his game elsewhere before stating a case so undeniable that the selectors had to give way.

But it seems perverse to hail the way ahead while falling into the same old pot-holes.

Back, though, to the T20 Blast. As 
Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings amassed 428 runs in last 
Friday’s IPL eliminator, Middlesex were busy inching their way to 117 
for seven in their 20 overs against Surrey at The Oval. To switch from 
ITV4 to Sky Sports was to quit Bacchanalia for Bognor Regis.

And
 the difference between the two tournaments is about more than cash and 
the weirdly cadenced musings of Danny Morrison. It is there in the 
attitude.

During Sunday’s 
final in Bangalore, the Punjab captain George Bailey gave a full quota 
of overs to a leg-spinner called Karanveer Singh, who has played all of 
four first-class matches.

Karanveer finished with four for 54 – and Punjab failed to defend 200. But Bailey had taken a chance and, as one batsman after another traded in a mix of sixes and miscues, it very nearly paid off.

It was a gamble, it was beguiling, and it was the kind of decision few English captains would have dreamed of making.

Fred and KP should be fun to watch. But the enjoyment of pleasures past mustn’t obscure the hunt for treasures future.

Eighteen months ago, in a wood-panelled back room at Nagpur, MS Dhoni casually insisted that India’s first Test series defeat at home to England in nearly three decades wasn’t his most disappointing moment as captain. What then? 0-4 in England? 0-4 in Australia?

No. Dhoni opted instead for India’s early exit from the 2007 World Cup – a result that was as hurtful to sponsors and broadcasters as it was to the cricketers.

And that set of priorities was evident again on Friday, after Dhoni’s Chennai Super Kings were beaten to a place in the IPL final by a Virender Sehwag-inspired Kings XI Punjab.

Dhoni’s mask slipped: his overseas players had been ‘irresponsible’, he had ‘belief in my bowling that they will definitely let them score over 200 runs’, and ‘in our bowling attack also there is hardly any quick bowler who can push [Sehwag] onto the back foot’.

It’s possible Captain Cool has never been hotter under the collar – or more revealing of his priorities.

Sunil Narine caused a stir by choosing to play for Kolkata Knight Riders instead of joining up with his West Indian colleagues ahead of their three-Test series at home to New Zealand.

Regardless of the intransigence by the West Indies board as they seek to apply their new (and overdue) ‘West Indies First’ policy, it was instructive to read Narine’s assessment of his own Test career in The Hindu.

Stretching himself a bit thin: Sunil Narine chose to play in the IPL rather than join up with West Indies

‘I am sure if I work hard at it and continue to get opportunities I will get better at bowling in that format,’ said Narine, whose 21 Test wickets have come at 40 apiece. ‘Endurance and patience are the key in Tests.’ And yet the question inevitably arises: how much does he really care?

Figures in the IPL final of 4-0-46-1 – the joint-second-most expensive of his 126-match Twenty20 career – seemed like a dubious trade-off for missing a Test series.

At some point this summer, the cry will go up for Monty Panesar to return to the Test team: it’s hard to imagine England playing a five-match series against India without employing a front-line spinner, and Panesar remains the best we have following the retirement of Graeme Swann.

But his latest skirmish with the authorities, this time after he forgot to turn up for an Essex team meeting, makes you wonder exactly where his mind is. Monty, over to you.

Not everyone agrees that bowling actions which narrowly transgress the 15 degrees of flexion allowed by the regulations are necessarily bad for the game.

But since the regulations are there, it seems strange that it has taken umpires so long to query Sri Lankan off-spinner Sachithra Senanayake – which they duly did after Saturday’s fourth ODI at Lord’s.

There is barely a more visible kink in world cricket.
