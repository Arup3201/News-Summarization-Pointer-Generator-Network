A Labrador has given her family 12 unexpected early Christmas presents.

Three-year-old Lucy started giving birth at the home of her ‘auntie’, Annette Thompson, in Kirkholt, Rochdale.

But neither she, nor Lucy’s owner Rachel Foy, had known she was pregnant.

'I couldn’t believe it,' said Ms Thompson, who was looking after Lucy for a short time. 'She just came up to me trying to get my attention and then suddenly a pup appeared. Then they just kept coming and coming.'

Lucy the three-year-old labrador looks as mystified as anyone as the 12 black pups suckle up to her at home in Kirkholt, Rochdale. A German Shepherd she was left alone with appears to be the prime suspect

Lucy's family had not even realised she was pregnant when she went into labour

Neighbours and friends have taken turns in bottle feeding them

And in a freak twist, all 12 were born on the 12th of the 12th 2012.

'It was such a coincidence, and we have managed to keep them all alive and healthy.'

Looking
after the pups has been a full-time job for Ms Thompson, her neighbours
and friends, including Michelle Jones, Mandy Greenwood and Gemma 
Saunders, who have taken turns in bottle feeding them.

And her 12 puppies made a timely appearance, all being born on 12/12/12

'I would like to give a massive thank you to everyone who has helped me, because without them, these dogs would not be alive,'  she said.

It is thought Lucy fell pregnant when she was left alone with another dog in the family, German Shepherd Jack, who is 18-months-old.

The family had booked Lucy in for an appointment to be neutered, but the pups arrived too soon.

'We thought Jack was too young to be able to do anything. But obviously he wasn’t and we know that now.

'I would definitely advise other dog owners to get their pets neutered when they are as young as possible.

'The puppies are lovely but it has been a lot of hard work and quite expensive to look after them.'

Ms Thompson will look after the pups and keep them with their mother until they are eight-weeks-old, after which she will find homes for them.
