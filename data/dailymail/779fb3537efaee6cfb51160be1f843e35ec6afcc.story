Human traffickers are receiving £15,000 a time for forcing women to have babies following sham marriages. 

Detectives investigating an organised crime group suspected of bringing women into Greater Manchester from Eastern Europe believe the traffickers are selling them for £3,000.

But the price increases to £15,000 if they will agree to have a child with their bogus husband. 

The shocking price of women emerged as officers arrested eight men and three women during raids in Rochdale, Oldham and Cheetham Hill as part of Operation Retriever.

Eight men and three women were arrested by Greater Manchester Police during raids in Rochdale, Oldham and Cheetham Hill 

They were arrested after police went to properties in Greater Manchester as part of Operation Retriever 

They were arrested over a trafficking ring which saw a pregnant woman almost tricked into an abortion following a sham marriage.

The 20-year-old from Slovakia was sold for up to £15,000 by a gang in Greater Manchester who organised a marriage to a 38-year-old man facing deportation, police said.

Officers were alerted when the woman told an interpreter she had been 'sold against her will' and was 'appalled' by the idea of an abortion. 

The group of men and three women, aged between 24 and 57, were arrested after police and officers from the Home Office went to properties in Greater Manchester yesterday.

The offences for which they have been arrested include trafficking people for exploitation, conspiracy to facilitate breach of immigration law, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration into a member state. Two people were arrested over being overstayers in the UK.

From there she was transferred to Ashfield Road, Rochdale, where she was forced to marry a 38-year-old man

The NCA’s United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC) estimates that 2,744, people, including 602 children, were potential victims of trafficking for exploitation in 2013.

This represented an increase of 22 per cent on 2012.

The report lists the 10 most common countries of origin for victims, which shows Romania as the most prevalent country overall, and Poland as the most likely nation for labour trafficking.

The number of British victims increased 124 per cent to 193, of whom three quarters had been trafficked around the country for sexual exploitation.

Nearly seven out of 10 of the British people found to be potential victims of trafficking were children, or 128 of the total, an increase of 236 per cent year-on-year.

In May the woman, who was 25 weeks pregnant, was flown to Luton, believing she was going to visit her sister.

She was met by a man at Luton Airport, claiming to be her sister's friend and she was initially held in London before being taken to Wesley Street in Failsworth, Oldham. 

He was paid between £10,000 and £15,000 by the trafficking gang to arrange the sham marriage, police said. 

She was then moved to Ashfield Road, Rochdale where she was forced to marry a 38-year-old man. 

In July, the pair married under Sharia law in Rochdale. 

The woman was later taken the Royal Oldham hospital for an appointment by another woman, who acted as an interpreter and told staff she wanted an abortion.

But medical tests revealed the victim, 20, was more than 25 weeks pregnant - and it would have been illegal to abort the baby.

The hospital alerted social services who made her unborn baby subject to a child protection plan.

After she failed to attend medical appointments the police became involved and an independent interpreter was hired to interview the woman.

She confessed that she had been sold to an Asian family and subject to a forced marriage after entering the country on the belief that she would be meeting her sister in the UK.

Police said it became clear 'she was being sold into a marriage against her will.' 

Mr Faulkner, Detective Inspector of Greater Manchester Police said there were as many as 400 cases involving women being trafficked for sham marriages in the Manchester area

DI Jim Faulkner, who is leading Operation Retriever, said: 'It transpired that she never wanted an abortion and the marriage was carried out in a local house that was used as a mosque.

'As part of this investigation we found that the going rate for a standard female was around £3,000.

'The going rate for a pregnant female rose from between £10,000 and £15,000, because it virtually guarantees leave to remain.' 

The investigation linked addresses across Greater Manchester with women being brought into the country under false pretences and promises of a new life before being forced into marriage.

The team identified potential suspects who were involved in arranging the trafficking of women and facilitating the marriages.

Mr Faulkner said there are currently as many as 400 cases involving women being trafficked for sham marriages in the Manchester area. 

He added: 'Each sham marriage costs the UK economy £40,000.

'That’s a Rochdale figure of £15m through benefits and cost to public services. The national picture is billions.' 

The details of the sham marriage come in the wake of a fake bride who was caught with 'crib sheets' listing her husband's height, weight, shoe size, how they met and how often they had sex.

The claim was revealed at Sheffield Crown Court yesterday as seven men and women stood trial over an alleged plot to gain visas for four Pakistani men - by pairing them off with British brides.

The women were allegedly paid up to £7,000 each to take part in bogus ceremonies in Nottingham, Leicester and Hertfordshire arranged by 38-year-old Masoud Rasab. 

Rasab, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, is said to have run a bride delivery service for almost four years until July last year, helping the four desperate men stay in Britain.
