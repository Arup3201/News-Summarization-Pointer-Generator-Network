Tweets from accounts that users do not follow will now appear in their Twitter timeline, in a move that has angered users worldwide.

The new feature has been confirmed today on Twitter's support page after users first reported the appearance of content from other accounts last week, with many believing it was just an experiment.

Normally, a user's Twitter timeline is filled by posts from accounts the user follows, as well as retweets from those accounts.

The new feature has been confirmed today on Twitter's support page after users first reported the appearance of content from other accounts last week, with many believing it to be just an experiment

On Twitter's 'Discover' page, users can see recommendations for accounts they may find interesting in the 'Who to follow' box.

These are based on the types of accounts the user is already following and who those accounts follow. Now posts from these users will also appear on their main timeline.

As well as this, the social network will find content that is popular or relevant based on the user's previous tweets. These posts will be published on their timeline, regardless of whether the Tweeter is being followed.

Twitter will also republish posts based on how people in a network are interacting with it.

The new feature will mean that 'favourited tweets' - traditionally a way of saving a tweet without making them public - will start to appear in users' timelines.

But this has now changed, as the site's support page explained.

'Additionally, when we identify a Tweet, an account to follow, or other content that's popular or relevant, we may add it to your timeline,' a statement on the official site said.

'This means you will sometimes see Tweets from accounts you don't follow.

'We select each tweet using a variety of signals, including how popular it is and how people in your network are interacting with it.

'Our goal is to make your home timeline even more relevant and interesting.'

The new feature will also mean that tweets that are 'favourited' - traditionally a way of saving a tweet without making them public - will start to appear in other users' timelines who haven't favourited the tweet..

But it has always been possible to view favourites by using the Discover section of the Twitter app or website.

The change is seen by some as an attempt to increase user interest as the site looks to close the gap on Facebook. 'Our goal is to make your home timeline even more relevant and interesting,' Twitter said

The change is seen by some as an attempt to increase user interest as the site looks to close the gap on Facebook in user numbers.

As of March this year, Twitter had 241 million active users globally, with more than 15 million in the UK.

In comparison, rival social network Facebook has more than one billion users active each month.

The move has proved unpopular with users so far, with many taking to the site to voice their frustration at the new, unwanted content appearing within their timeline.

One user from Manchester tweeted to complain he was seeing content related to his deceased stepfather now appearing on his profile.

For the moment, the change does not affect third-party Twitter apps like Tweetbot, which are operated by independent software and present user timelines in alternative ways, as well as offering different features.

But it is likely the apps will absorb this new feature eventually thanks to their connection with Twitter's main servers.

'Twitter purists will accuse today's update of the platform moving one step closer to being Facebook, as it shifts from personally-curated content to recommended content,' said Jack Parsons, a technology expert from Android Magazine.

'However, this change makes sense for Twitter as a company as it will make the social network more accessible to enterprises looking to promote their products, just as the introduction of images appearing in timelines did several months ago.

'It will be interesting to see how everyday tweeters adapt to this new feature and whether or not they think will more carefully about how they favourite a tweet.'

Swathes of Twitter users have expressed annoyance at the roll-out of an experimental new feature.

Users of the social network have reported seeing tweets favourited by other people in their own timeline.

In addition to this, some members have complained that their feed shows tweets alerting them that an account they follow has followed a new account.

Currently, only retweets posted by accounts that someone has personally chosen to follow show up on timelines, as well as advertisements, according to the Next Web.

Members have voiced their anger over the ‘experiment’, with many explaining that they were never given the option to opt out of sharing content they had marked as a 'favourite' with their followers.

One user said: 'I really, REALLY hate all these new Twitter things',while another vented: 'If I wanted to see what my friends favourite, I could look. I neither want nor need it added to my timeline.'
