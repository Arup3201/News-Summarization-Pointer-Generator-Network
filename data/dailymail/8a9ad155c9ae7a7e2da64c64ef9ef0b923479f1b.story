Amir Khan enjoyed the luxury of a slap up breakfast before weighing in for his big fight with Devon Alexander.

Khan had woken in the morning more than half a pound under for the 10st 7lbs welterweight limit.

That gave him the unusual indulgence of his pre-scale treat. He then came in exactly on the limit.

The pair had to be split apart by Golden Boy Promotions promoter Oscar De La Hoya during the weigh-in

Khan said: 'As I've been saying, I'm really comfortable now in this higher division. My weight's perfect and you'll see that my strength and power has grown.'

Alexander was also right on the weight.

The pair then exchanged some light banter. Khan told his opponent: 'I'm from England but I've got more fans than you in America. I'm going to win this in style.'

Alexander responded: 'You've got to say that, in your mind you know I'm going to beat you. You know you're already beaten.'

Alexander is adamant Khan knows he's already a beaten man ahead of Saturday's bout

The weigh-in took place in the MGM Grand Garden Arena, where the fight itself will happen.

This tradition began when Ricky Hatton brought his blue Manchester City army to Vegas for his fights with Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.

Then, and for subsequent Mayweather and Pacquiao fights, this ritual has been almost as crowded as the fights themselves.

By comparison the Khan Army was more like a platoon but they still kicked up a din.

The upper tier of the arena has been curtained off. But while Oscar De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions are clearly not expecting a sell-out they are predicting a healthy attendance.

Of the possibility of going to fight Mayweather if he wins, Khan said: 'A lot of people are saying now that it may well happen but I'm concentrating on beating Devon and then we'll see how it falls.'

Khan v Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports late this Saturday night.
