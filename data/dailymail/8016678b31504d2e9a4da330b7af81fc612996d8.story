Microsoft liaised with the US intelligence services so they could access emails, including Hotmail, and listen in on Skype video calls.

Officials at the software giant and the US National Security Agency collaborated to get around the company’s own encryption programmes, according to documents seen by the Guardian newspaper.

The paperwork, provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden, apparently demonstrates the level of co-operation between Silicon Valley and the intelligence services over the past three years.

Co-operation: Microsoft liased with US intelligence agencies so that they could spy on unsuspected people's emails, according to documents seen by The Guardian

They show that Microsoft helped the NSA intercept web chats and e-mail addresses including Hotmail and Outlook accounts.

They also reveal the company worked with the FBI to allow the NSA easier access via the Prism program to the cloud storage  system SkyDrive, which has more than 250million users.

And in July last year, nine months after Microsoft bought Skype, the NSA boasted that ‘a new capability’ had allowed it to  triple the amount of Skype video calls collected through Prism.

Material collected through Prism is routinely shared both with the FBI and CIA and one NSA document even described the program as a ‘team sport’.

Listening in: As well as emails, the documents suggest that Microsoft liased with intelligence services so that they could monitor Skype conversations

The revelations expose the extent of tensions between major tech firms in Silicon Valley and the Obama administration.

The firms want to be allowed to speak openly about how much they co-operate with the NSA in order to placate their customers’ concerns over privacy.

In private, they insist the access given to the US intelligence agencies is not one of collaboration but is driven by legal compulsion.

Leak: The documents were provided to The Guardian by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden

Microsoft said: ‘When we upgrade or update products we aren’t absolved from the need to comply with existing or future lawful demands.’

But the company maintains it provides customer data ‘only in response to government demands and we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers.’

Since Prism's existence became public, Microsoft and other technology giants denied any knowledge of the programme.

But although Microsoft launched an advertising campaign and Skype has a privacy policy which both trumpet the companies privacy policies, secret internal NSA newsletters suggest that the companies co-operated with the intelligence community, The Guardian reports.
