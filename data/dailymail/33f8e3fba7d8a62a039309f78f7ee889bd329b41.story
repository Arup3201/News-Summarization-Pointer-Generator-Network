George McGavin hosts a news series called Monkey Planet

The most audacious daylight robbery since The Italian Job will have us gasping at our TVs this week - and the criminals aren't human.

A gang of rhesus macaques ransack an Indian home and make off with every last crumb. But there's no need for a Crimewatch appeal to catch these crooks, because the hidden cameras of BBC1's new animal documentary series Monkey Planet have captured every stage of the heist.

The gangsters have been hanging round a street market, trying to snatch fruit, but an open window in an apartment block tips them off to easier pickings. Swinging along the power lines, the macaques post lookouts before peeping through the window.

One swaggers in and pinches a mango from a fruit bowl. Another seizes a naan bread. Then the rest of the troop bowl in - and chaos ensues. Tables are overturned, curtains torn and cupboards stripped bare.

Then a particularly clever monkey works out how to open the fridge, and discovers a dozen eggs. Smashing them on the floor, the rascals start slurping them up - until one gangster overturns a tin bowl with a clatter.

Spooked, the burglars run... all except one, who darts back to nick the last chapati. 'It's so human,' laughs presenter George McGavin, the author and academic who has jetted all over the world filming monkeys and apes for the show.

He had another encounter with macaques at a temple in Thailand, where the monkeys are revered as divine beings.

They make the most of their holy privileges, climbing all over visitors and stealing whatever they can. George managed to hang on to his spectacles, but he concedes that it was difficult to remember his script with monkeys hanging round his neck. 'I got one little nip,' he says, 'from a young one who got a bit over-excited. But that wasn't the real problem. There were monkey droppings everywhere, and all over their feet - so after a day's filming, I really stank.'

George is a TV veteran but Monkey Planet is, he says, the best thing he's ever done - three hour-long shows that took him from Africa and Asia to the US and everywhere in between. Filming the snow monkeys of Japan, his team took a thermal camera to discover how the macaques stay alive in sub-zero temperatures.

That meant an uncomfortable day for George, as he stripped to his underwear in a blizzard.

'It's TV,' he shrugs. 'You have to show and tell - it's not enough just to say it's cold.' The heat-sensitive images reveal how fast a human loses heat: George's feet and head go a chilly blue within seconds.

'If I'd been on my own it would have been a crazy thing to do. My hands were so cold I couldn't get dressed.' The monkeys cope by huddling on high branches at night and taking turns to squeeze to the warm centre of the pack - behaviour never caught on film before.

The sequence that thrilled him most, though, was shot in Uganda within moments of arriving in the forest. As the team unpacked their cameras, they realised chimpanzees were hunting overhead, pursuing a troupe of colobus monkeys.

Grabbing the cameras, George and the crew chased after them, before lurching to a halt - the chimps had caught one of their prey. 'I squatted down on my haunches and didn't move as they ripped this animal apart. The alpha male plucked the heart out of this big colobus, held it up still beating and then ate it.

We didn't capture that on film - but frankly, I don't think we could have screened it on BBC1 anyway. It was too gory.' He was shocked at first. But when he reflected, George says he realised humans commit far worse acts of violence - 'and not because we're hungry, either. I still think of all the animals I trust least it has to be humans.'

Most of the primates he filmed are rather cuter, though. His personal favourite was the aye-aye, a creature that has bat's ears, a squirrel's tail and hunts for grubs with a long, bony finger that's much more sensitive than its other digits.

For sheer adorability, though, an orangutan called Siswe takes the biscuit... and the bananas. She and her colony live on the edge of an Indonesian river, close to a village, and have picked up human quirks such as how to wash their fur with discarded shampoo. Siswe likes to work up a good lather before dousing herself with river water. Then she borrows a canoe to paddle across to the opposite bank.

Most remarkable of all, Siswe has worked out how to open a door with a key. George and the crew waited days to film this behaviour, leaving a bunch of ripe bananas on display in a locked cabin. As the clock ticked down, Siswe refused to perform and lazed under a tree instead. 'I'm certain she was winding us up,' says George, half seriously.

But when the team were about to pack up, Siswe ambled over, took the key, turned the lock and took the fruit. She might have a career in crime ahead of her... there's certainly a pack of macaques who'd appreciate her lock-cracking services.
