A four-year-old girl and her seven
month sister are among the children killed in the Oklahoma Tornado.

MailOnline has learned that the
sisters, the youngest of four siblings, were at home with their mother in Moore
when the storm hit.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline
father Phillip Vargyas told of his devastation: ‘We just don’t know what to do
anymore.’

Tragedy: Karrina, 4, and Sydnee, seven months, were killed in Monday's tornado. They are pictured with their older siblings DamoN, 11, and Aria, 8, who survived the storm at school

Daughters Karrina, 4, and Sydnee,
seven months, were at home with their mother Laurinda while their older
siblings, brother, Damon, 11 and sister Aria, 8, were at school.

They survived the storm but the
family home was ripped apart with Laurinda and the girls inside it. The two little girls died of blunt force trauma, officials revealed on Wednesday.

Describing the family’s loss Mr
Vargyas said simply: ‘At this point we have a lot of things to do, little
things to do for the girls.

‘We are trying to move in the
right direction but it’s hard to know where to go at all, what to do.’

Mr Vargyas is an IT Manager while
his wife is a stay-at-home mother.

The family are tonight
staying with friends though in truth, Mr Vargyas said: ‘There is nothing you
can do, nothing anyone can do at this point.’

His wife was too distraught to speak.

Against this helpless grief
members of the community so hobbled by the tornado’s force are doing what they
can to offer practical support to those left without power, water or shelter.

Churches across neighboring
Norman, Oklahoma City and Tecumseh of various denominations displayed signs
offering hot showers, hot coffee, shelter, food.

Destruction: Officials said 2,400 homes had been destroyed or damaged in the tornado

Yesterday evening St Andrews United
Methodist Church, Oklahoma City held a prayer service.

Pastor DA Bennett offered prayer
for those who had been displaced and injured, for the first responders,
teachers who had shielded pupils against the storm and dragged them from the
rubble and every family who had lost their home or, worse, someone they loved.

He began the service with a
reading from the Book of Job in which Job is told of his children’s death: ‘a
powerful wind blew in from the wilderness, the house collapsed and all your
children are dead.’

The night before that same Church
had been the site of reunions between parents of South Moore High, placed in
lock down during the Tornado but unharmed, and their children.

It was also the site of slow,
awful heartbreak for some of the parents whose children did not emerge from the
wreckage of Plaza Towers Elementary.

Pastor DA Bennett explained:
‘There was some confusion. Our church is a Red Cross Shelter and was designated
as a sited to  reunite the South Moore High students with their parents.’

Pastor Bennett’s own son was among
that number. He and his wife were, he admitted, ’99 percent sure’ that all was
well but until he put his arms around his son, he admitted,  ‘You live in
that 1 percent.’

Rebuilding: Families were combing through belongings and beginning to try and take stock of the damage today

But for the parents of the lost
children of Plaza Towers there was no such moment of reunion.

One State Trooper who preferred
not to be named told MailOnline how he and his colleagues had to gather the
parents who had mistakenly come in hope of finding their children.

He said: ‘We took them to one side
and sat them down and we had to go through with them asking them to describe
what their child was wearing, what they looked like that day.’

It crossed his mind he admitted
that they might have hoped to be identifying found children about to be
reunited with their families.

In fact they were providing descriptions to match
to the bodies already recovered and in the Chief Medical Examiner’s care.

‘Words‘, he said. ‘Cannot describe
that night.’
