This breathtaking panoramic 360 degree image shows the path of the stars as they light the night sky in a South American valley over several hours.

A series of 89 shots, taken one every 30 seconds, have been combined and stacked to form this 360 degree cosmic spectacle which shows the path of the stars lighting up the sky above the Valley of Cochiguaz, Chile.

In one of the world's best spots to see a clear night and dry sky, astrophotographer Hernan Stockebrand captured the display on October 15.

He said: ‘It was a fabulous starry night, far from the light and pollution of the cities.

‘This was my first attempt at a photograph like this so I think with some practice I can achieve longer exposure and capture even better trails in the future.’

Mr Stockebrand, 24, took the photographs from the site at the 
Cancana Observatory, which can be seen in the image. He captured the stars on film using a 
camera specifically designed for astronomical work.

The astrophotographer has featured in national newspapers and won the Astrophotographer of the Year award at the National Conference of Astrophotography in Santiago, Chile.

The telecommunications engineering student recently won a study trip to Silicon Valley, in America, where he says he has achieved his childhood dream of working in a scientific observatory.

He said: ‘When I first started in photography I wanted to share images with people who might not have the opportunity to see the dark night sky and also teach them about the universe.’
