An outraged father has slammed rules which protect children with peanut allergies but allow children who have not been vaccinated against measles to sit next to his six-year-old son, who is recovering from leukemia.

Carl Krawitt, from Corte Madera, California, is the father of Rhett, six, and daughter Annesley, eight.

With Rhett recovering from a four-and-half-year battle with leukemia and, with California experiencing a measles outbreak, Mr Krawitt is worried his son could become infected with the illness while his immune system is still recovering.

Rhett underwent rounds of chemotherapy until his doctors last year declared he was in remission, but is not yet robust enough to be vaccinated.

His father says it could be months before Rhett is healthy enough to get all of his immunizations.

He is also at a higher risk of complications if he were to get measles because of his weakened immune system.

Mr Krawitt has now taken the unusual step of asking school officials to bar entry to students who have not been vaccinated due to family beliefs.  

Rhett underwent chemotherapy for three years for his leukemia – because of this he has a weakened immune system compared to other children

The family live in Marin County, which has the highest rate of personal belief vaccination exemptions in the Bay Area, and one of the highest rates in California.

Currently, 6.45 percent of children in Marin have a personal belief exemption, which allows parents to lawfully send their children to school unvaccinated against diseases like measles, polio, whooping cough and others.

His son attends Reed Elementary in Tiburon, a school with a seven per cent personal belief exemption rate - the statewide average is 2.5 percent.

Mr Krawitt told NPR: 'If you choose not to immunize your own child and your own child dies because they get measles, OK, that's your responsibility, that's your choice.

'But if your child gets sick and gets my child sick and my child dies, then your action has harmed my child.'

Mr Krawitt said at a parents meeting at his daughter's school that a staff member told parents not to send peanut products to school, since a child or children had an allergy and could die.

He told NPR that he replied: 'In the interest of the health and safety of our children, can we have the assurance that all the kids at our school are immunized?' 

He later found out that parents at the meeting were 'mad' that he asked the question as they do not immunize their children.

Now he and his wife, Jodi, have emailed the district's superintendent, requesting that the district 'require immunization as a condition of attendance, with the only exception being those who cannot medically be vaccinated.' 

He replied them and said the district is monitoring the situation 'closely' and will take whatever actions necessary to ensure the safety of students.

Unvaccinated children in California are required to stay home for the entire incubation period during any contagious-disease outbreak in their school - which is 21 days for measles - but there is no precedent for excluding unvaccinated students when there are no confirmed cases of a disease. 

Marin County Public Health Officer Matt Willis told Yahoo Parenting: 'I see the father’s request as a prompt to have important conversations as a community regarding our ethical obligations to one another.

'While the Krawitts’ request to the school might not be going anywhere right now it is going somewhere as far as stimulating discussions.'

A measles outbreak that began at Disneyland last month has now spread to at least 95 people across the US. 

Those at risk of exposure who haven't been vaccinated have been warned to stay at home for 21 days or, if they must go out in public, to wear a mask. 

A California high school barred dozens of non-vaccinated students from school yesterday over concerns that a classmate may have contracted measles..

The US experienced a record number of measles cases last year, with 644 infections from 27 states, amid a resurgence in a disease that was largely eliminated in 2000.
