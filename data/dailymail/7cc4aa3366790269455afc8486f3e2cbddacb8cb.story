An Ohio couple ended their nuptials to the familiar tunes--and insanity--of the 'Harlem Shake'.

Sunday's ceremony in Salem, Ohio, began normally enough.

'I now pronounce you one together,' the pastor said. 'You are husband and wife.'

Dance-off: Abby and Nate Netti took part in the 'Harlem Shake' craze at their wedding

As Abby and Nate Netti shared their first kiss, Nate raised his fist to cheers from the audience.

The couple then held hands. And when they were presented as husband and wife 'for the very first time', the music began pumping.

A groomsman started off the viral sensation, flailing his arms to the music as the newlyweds stared on, seemingly dumbfounded.

But when the beat dropped, the Nettis joined in along with the rest of the wedding party.

Even the pastor got in on the action, doing a variation on the Ukranian Kozachok folk dance.

After a few moments, the music stopped suddenly and the ceremony ended.

But the music started up again when the newlyweds walk back down the aisle.

The pair, shaking their shoulders, 'dance their way into marital bliss,' as their friend, David Seymour and poster of the video, wrote on YouTube.

As The Huffington Post pointed out, this isn't the first time the 'Harlem Shake' took over a wedding. In February, The Knot got together with Randy Fenoli Of 'Say Yes To The Dress' to produce their own version.

Other renditions of the craze include ones by NASA and the Miami Heat basketball team, as well as the underwater shake by the University of Georgia Men's Swim and Dive team.
