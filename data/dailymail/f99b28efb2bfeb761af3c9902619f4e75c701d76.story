This man has spent a whopping £15,000 following his favourite celebrities around the world - just to take a selfie.

Paul Carrington has maxed out his overdraft and credit cards in a mission to get photographs with his favourite stars.

He has been snapped with The Dark Knight Rises star Tom Hardy, pop star Peter Andre and the unlikely star of Benefits Street, White Dee.

Preparation for his celeb-stalking trips can take anywhere between a few hours and six months, where he painstakingly tracks a celebrities movements and plots the perfect time to strike and snap his camera.

Mr Carrington has hundreds of pictures with the stars, and says they would cover the floor, ceiling and walls of his home if we were to put them all up.

The singleton, who is currently unemployed, said: 'I get such a buzz from getting the pictures. A lot of them know me now and will ask how I’m getting on back in my home town of Birmingham.

'My favourite is Brendan O’Carroll, who plays Mrs Brown in Mrs Brown’s Boys.. I’ve met him as himself and as Mrs Brown.

'I’m even considering a career as an impressionist because I can do a great one of him.'

Mr Carrington, 46, who made his living as a stand up comedian until his father died in 2011, took his first celebrity selfie with Crissy Rock in June 2011.

He started his collection after picking up a programme from Scottish comedian Jenny Godley’s show and framing it.

Mr Carrington said: 'I was recently single and my flat was very bare.

'I stuck this programme on the wall with a few pictures around it, just to brighten the place up.

'Before long I was taking my own pictures just to put them on the wall. Now I have more pictures than I do wall space.'

Since then, his obsession has grown, and he now spends up to six months tracking a celebrity’s movements to pinpoint the perfect moment to strike.

He said: 'The easiest person to meet 
was White Dee. From a simple comment on her Facebook and I was having a 
cup of tea and a curry in her house a few hours later.

'That picture got the most likes I’ve ever had too - it got 78 in just 24 hours.

'I love White Dee as well. We’re actually quite close now.

'For
 all the bad press she gets, she’s a really nice girl. She came to see 
my friend when he was dying of cancer, just to cheer him up.'

Mr Carrington has traveled to Benidorm and Dublin to capture his celebrity crushes with trips costing around £1,000. With the right budget, he believes he could track down any celebrity in the world.

The comedian said: 'Sometimes it’s easy, if you know they’re filming somewhere you can just fly in and hang around.

'I flew to Dublin where they were filming for the Mrs Brown’s Boys film and found their set in a few hours. I didn’t even check into a hotel.

'The most difficult to track down was Crissy Rock. She had been performing in Benidorm at the same time as me, but it wasn’t until months later that I managed to track her down at a book signing.

Mr Carrington's first celebrity selfie was with actress and comedian Crissy Rock in 2011

'She invited me to a VIP party where I took my picture.'

Mr Carrington's celebrity hunting recently came to a stop as he ran out of funds, but he hopes to rejoin the comedy circuit and continue collecting celebrity images.
