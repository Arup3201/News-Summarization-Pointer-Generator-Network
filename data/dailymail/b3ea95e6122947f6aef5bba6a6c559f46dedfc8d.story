With eyelash extensions and falsies of eyelashes boosting our lashes to ever more impossible lengths, it is seemingly no longer enough to layer on a slick of bog standard mascara.

One beauty brand is set to take mascara to a whole new level - by launching a product that promises to last three days - throughout showering, sleep - and even swimming.

Max Factor have unveiled Lashfinity 3 Day Mascara on the back of (admittedly slightly dubious) research that revealed 60 per cent of women would rather have a wardrobe malfunction, forget to clean their teeth or put on deodorant than be caught without mascara.

Endurance: Max Factor are unveiling a mascara they promise will last three whole days and won't budge in water or during sleep

Max Factor hope the 72-hour mascara, which will be sold in Boots, will become a beauty bag essential for summer.

No other product, as yet, can promise to stay put under such extreme conditions.. 

Max Factor, who are dubbing the £18.99 mascara 'life proof', say the formula is flake-resistant, wax-free and with a 'PermaHold' technology that gently bonds to the lash, creating what they say is a 'patent-like', jet-black finish, thanks to so-called 'lash-tint' technology.

Max Factor make-up artist Mel Arter said: 'Lashfinity 3 Day Mascara is totally unique to mass cosmetics and a remarkable product.

Long-lasting: Using 'lash tint' technology, designed to give a super jet black lash, Max Factor are dubbing this £18.99 mascara 'life proof'

'Never before have I seen mascara that acts likes a semi-permanent lash tint. It's an outstanding innovation.

'Applied in exactly the same way to a mascara, the formula coats and tints each lash to give darkness and definition that lasts an incredible three days.

'It’s a massive inspiration for women who don’t want to get caught without make-up.'

And it seems that the hype surrounding the innovative product is really taking off.

Four hundred beauty aficionados joined the waiting list within hours of it opening yesterday.

Max Factor aren't the first brand to unveil a product that promises to last for several days.

Right Guard Women Xtreme Dry Ultra Cool Maximum Strength is an Anti-Perspirant deodorant scientifically proven to give 72h protection.

Surely it just makes more sense to have a quick shower?
