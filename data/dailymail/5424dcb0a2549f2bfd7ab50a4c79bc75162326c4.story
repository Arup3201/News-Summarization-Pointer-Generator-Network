It doesn't have any wheels, the exhaust has rusted off and its worn- out leather sprung saddle has seen better days.

But experts say this 1939 Brough Superior SS80, which will cost £25,000 to fix, is a motorbike enthusiast's 'dream come true' - and have tipped the pre-war superbike to fetch £15,000 at auction on October 20.

Ben Walker, from Bonhams, said: 'It was bought by the vendor's father in 1964 and over the years parts have gone missing or rotted away.

This clapped out motorbike might look like a rust-bucket after spending more than 40 years rotting in a barn, but incredibly it is still worth £15,000

'But this is the Rolls Royce of bikes.'

This particular SS80 model - named after its guaranteed top speed - was an object of desire when it was bought in 1964.

But years of neglect saw it rot away until just the frame, engine, forks, gearbox and a set of rusty mudguards remained.

The Brough Superior SS80 model was first launched in 1922 and was regarded as a superbike due to its gutsy 982cc v-twin engine and blistering top speeds.

Production ceased in 1940 after more than 3,000 bikes had been built.

The Bonhams sale will be held at Staffordshire County Showground on October 20.
