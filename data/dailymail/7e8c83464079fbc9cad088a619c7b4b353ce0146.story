Roy Hodgson's England couldn't handle the heat of the kitchen in Brazil but at least his side can claim to have had a hand in a late winner for ITV with their defeat by Uruguay beating Great British Bake-Off for  the year's most watched telecast.

England were watched by an average of 13.9 million people back home in the UK as they fell victim to the brilliance of Luis Suarez, returning from injury to deliver a first-half header and a winner with six minutes to go either side of Wayne Rooney's first World Cup goal.

The match is the only broadcast to better the BBC's Great British Bake-Off finale, which attracted an average audience of 13.5 million as 60-year-old grandmother Nancy Birtwhistle claimed the title, though that figure also includes catch-up viewing and recordings over the following week.

England v Uruguay's audience in that June defeat peaked at 20.29 million viewers, a 70.7 per cent share of viewers, and was reported to be the biggest TV audience for the UK since 2012 London Olympics.

With no other broadcast likely to overtake that World Cup 'triumph' in the closing fortnight of 2014, it looks set to top a podium of Bake Off and BBC1 drama Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, which attracted 12.7 million viewers on New Year’s Day - however Christmas Day special are on the way for dramas Call the Midwife and Downton Abbey.

England's loss, their second in a row in Group D after first falling to Italy, effectively ousted Hodgson and his charge from the tournament before even facing Costa Rica.
